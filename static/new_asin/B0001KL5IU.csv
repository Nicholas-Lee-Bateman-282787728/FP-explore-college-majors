2008361,5,B0001KL5IU,"A funny show where a quirky detective is alternately helped and hindered by his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and several phobias.  The premiere was two hours long and episodes were 60 minutes long.  I'm impressed that this is widescreen and DTS!  Four discs and running time of 563 minutes doesn't leave much room for the extras, but I haven't been able to find much detail about the extras or their length.
Premiere:  1 & 2.  Mr. Monk  and the  Candidate:  Monk works as a private investigator  after losing his job on the police department due to his psychiatric problems.  Three years later, he gets a call from his old boss who needs his help to solve a  murder.
3.  Mr. Monk  and the  Psychic:  Monk and a psychic stage a psychic reading to catch a murderer.
4. Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale gs: Adam Arkin:  Monk tries to prove how a bedridden 800 pound man could have murdered a judge.
5. Mr. Monk Goes  to the Carnival:  Monk tries to discover who murdered a man riding on a ferris wheel.
6. Mr. Monk Goes  to the Asylum:  While incarcerated in a psychiatric facility, Monk learns of an unsolved murder.
7. Mr. Monk and the  Billionaire Mugger:  A billionaire is shot dead while supposedly mugging a couple outside a movie theater.
8. Mr. Monk and  the Other Woman:  While investigating the murder of a lawyer and his assistant, Monk is attracted to another woman who understands him.
9.  Mr.  Monk  and  the  Marathon Man:  Monk tries to find out who killed a woman during the San Francisco marathon.
10. Mr.  Monk Takes  a Vacation:  Monk goes on vacation to the beach with Benjy and Sharona.  The vacation ends when Benjy witnesses a murder.
11. Mr. Monk  and the Earthquake:  A man dies during an earthquake and Monk tries to prove that he was murdered.
12. Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger gs Willie Nelson:  Willie Nelson (playing himself) is suspected of killing his manager.
13. Mr. Monk and the Airplane gs Tim Daly:  Monk's concerns about flying doesn't keep him from investigating what he thinks might be a murder.  The flight attendant is played by Monk's wife in real life, Brooke Adams.",1085270400,187,2119,4.594086021505376
2008362,5,B0001KL5IU,"Tony Shalhoub as Monk is a miracle to watch.  His compassion and intelligence is evident in every moment of the performance.  Bitty Schram takes lots of edgy chances and almost always makes the grade as his assistant Sharona.  The mysteries are occasionally thin, but no one watches Monk for the mysteries alone - there's the brilliant, funny writing, the wonderfully sweet and involving overarching storyline (with one of the more compelling male/female relationships at the heart of the series...forget all the red herring flirtation between Sharona and dreary Disher, we all know Monk and Sharona are destined for each other, once he brings his late wife's killer to justice), and the commitment to quality of the whole production.
The DVD isn't out yet, but I know it'll be of the same quality as the released DVD pilot episode.  As Adrian himself might say, I could be wrong but you know I'm not.",1081382400,8,901,4.907894736842105
2008363,5,B0001KL5IU,"i loved watching this show, and i was beginning to thing that this dvd would never come out. iit pretty much about a detective who has ocd in the worst way and it very funny. Buy this DVD",1080864000,2,187,3.9473684210526314
2008364,5,B0001KL5IU,"For many years I waited for a detective show to come along that could capture my interests with a great mystery and a great mystery solver the way that Columbo did. I was beginning to think it would never happen, but with Monk, it did. I hope that Tony can continue to play Monk on into his 70's, just as Mr. Falk has continued to play Columbo. Excellent show!",1079395200,4,360,4.231884057971015
2008365,5,B0001KL5IU,"Meet Adrian Monk ( Tony Schloub). He is a man who has a countless number of phobias with being afraid of everything from heights and germs to milk. Adrian is also the greatest private detective around with a photographic memory and such a great eye for detail that it is almost creepy. As Adrian says, ""it's a gift and a curse"". Adrian used to be a homocide detective for the San Francisco Police Department, until his wife Trudy was killed in a car bomb. Three years have passed since, and Adrian's fears have made it impossible to be on the force. Adrian is now a private consultant for the department and assists Captain Leland Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford). Also along for the ride is Monk's nurse/personal assitant Sherona Flemming ( Bitty Schram)who keeps Monk in line and helps him with each case.
If you were to describe private detective Adrian Monk, it would probably be along the lines of ""Sherlock Holmes being afraid of everything"". This is what makes ""Monk"" one of the best shows that is currently on television. It is hard to classify what type of show Monk really is. Some people including myself watch the show for the cases that Monk solves. Each case is very unpredictable and you actually have a great time trying to solve the case before Monk does. Others watch the show because it tends to be quite funny at times. Tomy Schloub is an amazing actor and is extremely versatile. He made a name for himself playing the character Antonio on the show ""Wings"". He brings the same comic genius to the character Adrian Monk. Bitty Schram is also brilliant as Sherona. Watching her take care of Monk is hilarious. They almost appear to be like the ""Odd Couple"" at times. Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stratford are excellent as well.
Overall, ""Monk"" is one of my all time favorite shows. The actors involved are superb, each case is completely unpredictable, and the laughs are non stop. All I can say, is that it is about time that Monk is coming to DVD. The 13 episode first season is great from start to finish, and it deserves the DVD treatment. There is no word on what the extras will be yet, but the show is worth owning just for the episodes alone. A huge bonus is the fact that there is no commercial interruption!!",1078963200,12,2281,4.606879606879607
2008366,5,B0001KL5IU,"He's just like me. OCD, fear of heights, darks, germs, & confined places.
I started watching this when series when the episode ""Mr. Monk and the Airplane"" was on. I laughed till it hurt.
I never got to watch anything before that except some excerpts.
This Season One Box set will be terrific, I'm going to buy it as soon as I can.",1078444800,5,330,4.253968253968254
2008476,2,B0001KL5IU,"I'm conflicted with this series. The crime-solving puzzles of each episode are very engaging and are cleverly thought out. However, the need to feed off Monk's OCD as plot devices in each episode are cartoonish and juvenile and do more to distract from the storyline than enhance it. I made it through Season 4 and had to stop watching. At the very least I would have expected to see Monk's condition improve with time, but this was not the case. The crime puzzles warrant a 4 or 5, but the series only gets a 2 or 3 from me. The crime solving storyline of Monk is excellent, the OCD story bits of Monk make the show unwatchable.",1520553600,2,629,4.384615384615385

Just finished season 1 and plan to continue on to season 2.

2008553,3,B0001KL5IU,"I'm sorry but Monk was never the same after Sharona left (got forced out.) She was the best juxtaposition to Monk. I could never vibe with the girl that replaced her. She was always so stiff and didn't compliment Monk at all.

The tragedy is that Sharona was replaced because they didn't want to pay her even a fraction of the amount they did Tony Shalhoub. I think she even stated at one point that the travel costs to get to set and back she barely made a profit. So we ended up with a stick up the @ss wound wayyyyy too tightly replacement for her, and IMO the show was never the same. Still, it started out with a bang, and Adrian Monk's character is scripted gold and Tony Shalhoub's performance was impeccable as always.",1515715200,2,726,4.338235294117647

2008582,1,B0001KL5IU,"I wanted to like this, because the three primary actors are skilled. But this is a defective series. First of all, it steals from Columbo, special gifts, and idiot savant type police hero characters. Second, there are so many plot holes in it. An intelligent viewer is constantly realizing that things wouldn't have happened that way. It isn't a believable police drama such as Bosch. It's unbelievable. It tries real hard to be cute but comes across as cloying. Some of the plots and the ways that Monk makes his deductive leaps are stolen from Sherlock Holmes.

This show is not quite as funny. It serves its purpose as a cop show with interesting characters and a suitably convoluted storyline, but really doesn't shine as much as some other shows.

Sherona dresses like a prostitute, and several episodes insinuate that she used to actually be one! What a bummer because I looove the mysteries! They are really well thought out. I like Monk's character as well--kind of a modern day Sherlock Holmes meets OCD! I also tried to watch one of season 8 on YouTube and it had talked about porn and a guy paying a girl to video chat undressed. Family oriented?! That's a joke!",1488844800,,557,4.46078431372549

2008783,5,B0001KL5IU,This comedy detective show is entertaining in a whimsical way.  Monk is a thinker and solves mysteries using observation in a Sherlock Holmes manner- seeing things all others miss.  It's funny because he is a germophobe with precise processes from handshakes to eating.  A sad note to the show is that his wife was murdered a few years ago and the crime was never solved.  He grieves constantly and the viewer is left hoping that he will solve this particular crime someday.,1484697600,7,474,4.7439024390243905

2008812,4,B0001KL5IU,"I got a great deal on every season of Monk. I never actually watched the show before, but I am a huge fan of the Closer, and Monk seemed similar for a good price.

I was not disappointed. Monk is a detective with an inhuman attention to detail working as a private consultant for the police (very similar premise to the show Elementary in that regard). Unfortunately Monk also suffers from severe OCD and numerous phobias. This leads to some comedic situations (Monk chasing a bad guy into a sewer for example) and gives the character an interesting perspective that differs from a Brenda Lee or Sherlock.

The only thing I didn't really enjoy about the show in that some episodes start out showing the actual murder, so there is no tension when Monk has a suspect that everyone else thinks is crazy. We already know whether he has the right person or not. Despite this, Monk is still a good dinner time show. Not scary, not especially violent or vulgar, and interesting enough to keep your attention.",1483747200,7,1001,4.617977528089888

2009039,5,B0001KL5IU,"Here we are in early 2016 and I may be one of the few adults who has never seen a single episode of ""Monk"". I recently rectified that condition having viewed all of season 1.

PREMISE:
Adrian Monk was a Los Angelus police detective whose wife was killed in a car bomb explosion. He is convinced the bomb was intended for him. Monk was so devastated by the apparent unintended murder of his wife he withdrew from society for several years and now exhibits annoying but manageable obsessive compulsive behavior. His reentry into society and police work as a consultant can only be facilitated with the able assistance of a full time nurse Chiron. Monk has a ""Sherlock Holmes"" ability to solve baffling cases but the police department will not reinstate him due to his sometimes bizarre behavior. Each episode presents us and Monk with a strange murder that the police are stumped to solve and must call on Monk to find the guilty party.

CAST:
Tony Shalhoub as Adrian Monk is just terrific in a very difficult role. He must convince us that his mental disability is real by exhibiting annoying quirks without turning the show into slapstick gag fest. The fact that he pulled off this difficult acting challenge for 124 episodes over 8 seasons is amazing.
The supporting cast of Monk's nurse Sharona (Bittty Schram) and SF Detectives Stottlemyer (Ted Levine) and Disher (Jason Stanford) are not just window dressing for Monk's antics but make necessary contribution to each episode. The emotional tensions among and between the characters - for example Captain Stottlemyer resents Monk for his ability to solve the cases - kept this viewer entertained even with the story was somewhat banal.

LIKED:
 Admittedly some of the murder plots Monk must resolve are rehashed ideas that viewers of police shows have seen numerous times. Nonetheless every the most uninteresting episode is made if not memorable at least enjoyable by the witty banter among the actors and the creative shenanigans Monk confounds us with. This I believe is the true charm of this show.

SEASON 1 DVD COLLECTION:
The season 1 DVD package consist of five disks each in an individual snap lid package. All five slip into an external cardboard  box with series photos on the exterior. Season 1 consist of 16 episodes originally shown on the USA cable network July through October 2002.

FINAL COMMENTS:
The Monk shows are pleasant and enjoyable entertainments with likable characters and witty dialog. As a police procedural they are not very dramatic since Monk usually lets us know be the third reel who the perp is. This formula resonated with a wide audience hence the shows longevity over 8 seasons.",1460678400,,2670,4.893805309734513

Of course this is the first season where you get the gist of how capable this show can drum up sympathy and dark humor. It boasts the complexity of mental illness while at the same time observe the effect they can play out.

2009088,5,B0001KL5IU,"I didn't watch this show when it was current, I found it in re-runs and I'm so glad I did!  It's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and it's clean enough to watch with my eldest granddaughter when she spends the night.  We both love it; the OCD is hilarious, yet it sparked conversations about how sad it would be to live in his head.  The program often centers around a murder which you would never think they could turn into something funny, but they do it. Monk has his own special way of interpreting the evidence, so long as Sharona is nearby with an antibac wipe. As the Captain said, ""I'm standing right here.  I see the same things Monk sees, but I don't see what he sees!""  Monk is superbly acted and well-written, you'll love it.",1453593600,,745,4.292857142857143

2009092,5,B0001KL5IU,"Tony Shaloub is a dream in his role as Detective Adrian Monk. The same goes for the incomparable, Ted Levine as Captain Stottlemeyer. They make an unlikely, but wholly entertaining, crime fighting duo.

Jason Gray-Stanford, Bitty Schram, and Stanley Kamel (one of my favorite characters as Dr. Kroger, Adrian's caring and endlessly patient psychiatrist) are superb, too. Traylor Howard, who seamlessly and effortlessly joins the cast later in the series as a replacement for Bitty Schram, is an absolutely lovely addition. And the many, many cameos by various actors, actresses, musicians, and other well-known people are fantastic surprises in each episode they pop up in.

I cannot, for the life of me, think of one, single episode I didn't find entertaining. They were each so interesting and engaging, right up to the end. Monk will always be a TV series that I can come back to and watch time and again without ever getting tired of it.",1449187200,,941,4.987261146496815

This show deserves 10 stars.  I hope that Tony S will be able to make another character in the future that will hit the heart of the viewer just as much as this one did.

I love being able to laugh at the results of his obsessions, without laughing at him. These stories have lightened the load a little for me, and created bright spots that have defused chronic tensions that build up unnoticed when you live in a situation similar to Monk's.

2009232,5,B0001KL5IU,"Surprisingly USA started their own series production with Monk, an unusual crime drama, starring the Emmy winner Tony Shaloub. Until Monk, he was better known for his role as the Italian taxi driver in the sitcom, ""Wings."" Here in Monk, Shaloub captures a different role as Adrian Monk, a private investigator who consults the San Francisco Police Department's Homicide Unit. A few years prior to the show's debut, Monk's beloved wife, Trudy,"" was killed in an unsolved murder. Adrian had a breakdown and needed to recover.

In the first episode, Adrian and his trusty nurse, Sharona Fleming, played by Bitty Schram try to solve a murder in Santa Clara before his old unit contacted them for a consultation. Sharona Fleming is beside her employer, Adrian Monk, on call. She can't go away on vacation. She has become his rock and confidante. She is a single mother of a son, Benji. Monk has obsessive compulsive disorder and is constantly re-arranging things that annoy him. He is an excellent detective and notices details that escape most of us.

There are other cast members like Stanley Kamel who played his understanding psychiatrist and Ted Levine as Stottlemyer from the San Francisco police department. The series is set in San Francisco but filmed on location in Toronto, Ontario Canada. I know its for financial reasons but I would have loved to see the series actually filmed entirely on location in San Francisco.
I
n this first season, we get twelve episodes. Each episode is well-written, acted, and entertaining to watch. There are guest stars like Kevin Nealon, Garry Marshall, Brooke Adams (Shaloub's real life wife), Tim Daly (his old Wings' co-star), Willie Nelson, and others as well.

There are extras on the last disc featuring the behind the scenes; a background on the obsessive compulsive disorder; and how the show came to fruition especially the casting of the supporting cast and of course Monk played by Emmy winner, Tony Shaloub.",1416441600,,1958,5.0
2009233,5,B0001KL5IU,"One of the best shows out there! I enjoy Monk because it has a lot of humor, without the annoying laugh track. The noise level on this show is very low key, so it's easy to relax while watching. I bought every single episode, so I can watch them again and again and again...",1416009600,,274,4.092592592592593

2009235,5,B0001KL5IU,"I put off buying this first season of Monk for a long time, my reasoning (if we can call it that) being that I wasn't sure if the whole OCD, multi-phobic thing would hold up for, say, annual viewing.  Now my right heel is getting calloused from kicking myself in the butt for waiting so long.  How could I have forgotten how artfully Monk's neuroses are worked into the fabric of the show, how they add to the interactions between Monk and his nurse, his former commander, and the guest stars?  In the features comparisons are drawn between Monk and Peter Seller's Clouseau but I disagree.  I find far greater synchronicity with David Suchet's Hercule Poirot.  Hercule claims his obsessiveness is all about 'order and method' and Adrian blames it all on his deceased wife, but in both cases the silliness only serves to distract unwary miscreants from the brilliance of detectives who miss no details, and who turn them into clues which bring down the guilty.  Seasons two, three, and four of Monk are on their way to my doorstep even as we speak",1415145600,5,1046,4.627027027027027

And yay for the early seasons, because I'm a Sharona fan, and Bitty's Shram's take on the assistant role was perfect: tough, but likable; that's hard to balance in a character.

2009346,5,B0001KL5IU,"Monk season one contains four discs holding three episodes each.

Tony Shaloub is excellent at playing former detective Adrian Monk. Each episode contains one case for Monk to solve and they are often very interesting. There are a few episodes that lack a depth as you can easily figure out who the killer is. That, of course, does not mean that it ruins the episodes! In fact, a huge part of Monk is how funny the character is with his OCD and anxiety disorders.

As for the quality of the box, I was quite disappointed. The box is made of cardboard, and despite it being ordered as brand new it came completely torn up. The top was ripping off and their were multiple defects on the side of the box.

Monk is, overall, a fantastic series and I am desperately looking forward to watching future seasons. I would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a good, clean, funny and interesting TV series.",1361664000,,902,4.521472392638037

2009365,4,B0001KL5IU,"Goodbyes aren't easy; and so I feel a bit sad today that I just watched the last episode of ""Monk."" I didn't get to see the show while it was on TV, but discovered it four months ago on Netflix Streaming and I was addicted from the first episode and liked it all the way to the very last. Speaking of the last episode, that chase seen in the train station and between the trains is one of the most exciting scenes in the entire Monk series. I liked the way the series brought everything to a closure and ended, but it being such a good show, I still wish there were more episodes of it. I mean 125 episodes is alright, but 200 episodes would have been a nice, rounded number -- something Detective Monk would have liked!

And speaking of Mr. Monk, the character is played by the very smart and talented Tony Shalhoub. The supporting cast are all excellent and instead of describing them one by one, I'd just suggest that you watch the show and discover their brilliance for yourself.

Why the 4 stars and not 5? Well, Monk being a long-running TV series, every episode wasn't as brilliant as most others. But, all in all, there were more (far more) 'ups' than 'downs' and ""Monk"" will live on as a great TV series for generations to come.",1358208000,,1237,4.327586206896552

I think we all have a little bit of obsessive compulsive in us and when I see that in myself and in the show it makes it all the more humorous.  I have been seeing a therapist due to some life changing personal issues and I have enjoyed many movies and books about the relationship between therapists and their clients, but this one is just funny and it is an excellent break from all the serious stuff going on in my life right now.",1356652800,,555,4.3076923076923075

2009391,5,B0001KL5IU,"I purchased these particular seasons and season one which I've yet to receive,but I believe with the fine natural acting Bitty Schram did as Sharona Fleming and a perfect New Jersy accent along with her obvious care for the character MONK set the tone for the entire show. She created a character that will never be forgotten! She also has a great ambidextrous backhand playing tennis WOW! All this and great beauty, too.
Tony Shaloub is a fine and versatile actor. It's a shame he did not trust that to be discovered with the presence of Bitty. A great show was given way to going in a ""different direction"".
Did her Golden Globe award nomination concern Mr. Shaloub?
An actor with his fine ability lost out on the chance to be considered one of the most memorable TEAMS in show business!

Even murders in this serial do not look as bloody as in other movies, (a lot of humor helps.) Many of the characters are funny and memorable, which helps to forget about problems of the real world. Way to go!",1323475200,,419,4.185185185185185
2009399,4,B0001KL5IU,"I received this as a gift recently. If you're on this page, you probably already know that this is about a detective who has many gifts of observation, but he is also plagued with tragic limitations that prevent him from functioning on his own. (Or for that matter from doing what he does officially for the police dept of San Francisco.)

What makes this show so great is that there is a WONDERFUL chemistry between the 4 main characters. Monk is lovable (if also annoying). But he does the best he can with what he has despite his limitations. It is also refreshing to see a hero who is flawed and has limitations, but does his best. Stottlemeyer is a great voice of reason. He often reminds us of the painful truth that Monk can't function on his own, but even if he hurts us with this truth, he is right. And while harsh at times, he is usually fair. And he is certainly not without compassion at times.

Sharona is GREAT as Monk's nurse and helper. She works for him and is compassionate. But yet she is not afraid to tell him to cut something out. And to add to the comedy, sometimes the right looking guy distracts her from her duties. Disher is also great. He is the young cop who is eager to please his boss. And sometimes he messes up. BUT, other times he really comes through. In ""The Billionaire Mugger,"" Disher (with extreme courage) tackles an armed man.

I like the pilot. A bodyguard of the candidate for mayor is killed. Is the candidate for mayor in danger, or is this part of another picture? ""Mr. Monk and the Psychic"" is a great episode where the eccentric Monk convinces his friends that the well connected police commissioner probably killed his wife. ""Dale the Whale"" is an interesting episode. How could an 800 man who can't leave his bed have performed an act of murder miles away?

Moving on there is a creepy  episode that takes place at an amusement park. Could a cop have really killed someone there? The evidence says yes. But Stottlemeyer knows better. I didn't much like where Monk goes to the asylum.  ""Mr. Monk and the Other Woman"" is a great episode where Monk explores the possibility of falling in love again. But is the woman he finds attractive guilty of murdering several people?

""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger"" is a great episode full of comedy and suspense. It also explores some bounced check issues between Monk and Sharona. ""The Marathon Man"" was another episode I didn't like at all. Sorry. But then I really enjoyed ""Mr. Monk takes a Vacation."" That was an interesting episode where Monk is 'somewhat enjoying' his vacation with Sharona, but yet there is a murder at the resort. Sharona is understandably annoyed at her vacation being interrupted. But Monk finds a valuable ally in the spunky female detective at the hotel.

""The Earthquake"" is a great episode where we meet Sharona's sister, and Sharona finds herself fighting her sister over a nice guy. (But is he a little too nice?) ""The Red Haired Stranger"" was another episode I have to admit I didn't like at all. In the 12th and final episode, Monk deals with an interesting case where someone murdered a woman and 'took her place.' It wasn't my favorite episode but I like how the defeated villain had to offer Monk a bit of respect.

Overall 3 episdoes I did NOT like at all. 1 so so episode. And the other 8 were great. So overall, I'd say it's a good package.

Another thing this series does well is that for the most part, it avoids being too funny. As funny as this series gets, there are several moments of sadness that prevent the series from becoming a farce. And perhaps the best thing about this show is the chemistry. We know that all 4 characters need each other. (Even if they are not always so happy about it.)",1321833600,,3738,4.5081240768094535

2009426,4,B0001KL5IU,"Despite (especially in later seasons) laughably bad writing, this series is the only one to explore what it is like for widowers.  Monk's reaction to Trudy makes no sense, except to those who have been there.  His OCD complicates things.  He survives because of others and his love of detective work.  A very important show.  I recommend it only for the insight it gives.  Everything else including the so-called detective stories is laughably bad.",1308009600,,448,4.986486486486487

I was also disappointed to see how his relationship with the captain was strained at first once he became a ""private consultant"". It's good to know things improve.

2009465,4,B0001KL5IU,"Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky. But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective.

And the first season of ""Monk"" succeeds in bringing an odd twist to the traditional detective TV show. Tony Shalhoub shines as everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive detective, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.

Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely and had to leave the police force. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) babysitting him.

When a politician is nearly killed in a mystery shooting, the police are baffled. So Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) reluctantly calls in his old pal to solve the case. From then on, Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (""It's a gift.... and a curse"") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.

The cases that follow are no less confounding -- Monk must deal with a supposed psychic, a grotesquely obese financier who is unable to get out of bed, a stabbing on a Ferris wheel, a murder in an asylum, a billionaire mugger, a marathon alibi, a vacation gone wrong, an earthquake, a date, a murderous Frenchman, and a murder seemingly committed by Willie Nelson.

""Monk"" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, the fact that it lasted even one season -- let alone several -- is nothing short of miraculous. The first season is not quite the best, but it's a thoroughly solid basis for this comedy/mystery series.

There are gunfights and pperwork, like on any cop show, but the main focus here is on detecting. And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes, which only Monk could unravel. Not to mention the dialogue, which leans heavily on dry humour (""You've got to be a little skeptical, Sharona. Otherwise you end up believing in everything -- UFOs, elves, income tax rebates..."")

But the series wouldn't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub. He played weird roles in movies like MIB and ""Galaxy Quest,"" and so he knows how to balance out Monk's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either. And he does a brilliant job with Monk's devotion to his late wife Trudy, which is so strong and pure that you'd never known years had passed.

Schram serves as the Watson to Monk, and her hard-edged New York single mom is a nice foil -- especially since it's her job to keep him in contact with reality. And while Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford seem rather cold to Monk initially, once they warm up they become excellent police counterpoints to Monk, as genial police chief Stottlemeyer and his earnest (if slightly goofy) sidekick Randy Disher.

2009467,5,B0001KL5IU,"Amazingly, the USA Network is somehow coming up with some of the most solid and entertaining shows in evening prime time, and has been doing so for the last few years.

Monk is a prime example, and benefits from having the casting come out perfectly. When I read of some of the other actors that were considered for this role, I just shudder. This brilliant show that has entertained us for several years now would most likely have gone down the tubes after a few shows with someone like Michael Richards in the role. He would have overplayed Monk's idiosyncrasies to the point that they would have become tiring to the audience VERY quickly. With Tony, they are a constant backdrop that provide just the right balance of comedy, sympathy for his problems, and dramatic device on occasion.

The show is quite well acted, and the mysteries are solid. I find very little in the way of plot holes, and normally I can find enough of those in a mystery show or movie to make it look like Swiss cheese! Very enjoyable, highly recommended.

Bear in mind that as of the date of this review, Monk is being heavily shown on the Sleuth channel. So if you have that channel on your cable or satillite network, you may not need to buy the DVDs to get your ""Monk fix"".",1278979200,,1254,4.467248908296943

2009501,5,B0001KL5IU,"I enjoy reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.  There is a part of me that always wanted to have the ability that Holmes' does to come to a crime or mystery and notice what even very keen minds overlook and be able to successfully solve the mystery.  Holmes has been the model of many a television detective Columbo to Jessica Fletcher and served as the current reigning king of cable television, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub).

The first season DVD set of MONK follows Monk as he returns to public life seven years after the murder of his beloved wife, Trudy.  The two-part series opener sets the stage for the rest of the series.  Monk was a brilliant homicide detective in the San Francisco police department before his wife's death. In fact, he solved every case he was assigned to.  Monk was always an unusual character, but after Trudy's death, all of his disorders and phobias became accentuated.  Through the assistance of a nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), Monk was able to return to public life and the first episode features his first case as a private consultant hired by his former commander, Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine).

There are two things that really set MONK apart from other shows that came before it.  One is the writing.  Unlike most previous television detectives, e.g. Columbo, Monk is who he is.  He doesn't pretend to be less intelligent than he is and his obsessions and phobias are all real. The unusual places and situations that Monk finds himself in are often humorous because of this.  In the hands of lesser writers, these situations could be used solely for comic effect to mock Monk, but they never are.  Comical and funny things happen, but Monk and most of the rest of the cast are never mocked (the only exception to this being Randy Disher-portrayed by Jason Gray-Stanford-who sometimes eats crow because of his Barney Fife-type personality).

The other thing that really stands out about MONK is the superb acting, especially Tony Shalhoub.  Monk could easily have just been played as a caricature and the show would have still been a good show.  However, Shalhoub never played Monk that way and his performance truly brings Monk to life.  As quirky, odd, and unusual Monk is, he seems like a real person and reminds viewers and fans of people in their own lives.  Shalhoub has so far won three Emmy's for his portrayal of Adrain Monk and has been nominated several times more. It's not difficult to understand why.

The first season includes the following episodes:

Episode 1--""Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Part I""--Monk returns to public life after being called on to investigate the attempted assassination of a mayoral candidate and the murder of his bodyguard.

Episode 2--""Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Part II""--Monk solves the case.  Involves an exciting chase through the sewers and features one of the few times in the entire series where Monk shoots a weapon.

Episode 3--""Mr. Monk and the Psychic""--Dolly, a false psychic with a record wakes up one morning in her car next to a murder scene. She claims that the dead woman lead her there to find her, but Monk suspects there more to the story that Dolly doesn't know.

Episode 4--""Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale""--Dale Biederbeck is to Monk as Moriarty is to Sherlock Holmes.  Dale is a Whale of a man, weighing over 800 lbs. who is unable to leave his bed.  But, Dale the Whale is also a very wealthy and extremely intelligent person who has been suspected of being the mastermind of many past crimes.  The murdered judge called 911 and clearly states that Dale the Whale is trying to kill her and a ten-year boy eyewitnesses a huge, fat man roaming around the house.  But how could Dale the Whale have killed the judge if he can't even get out of bed?  Monk figures out how.

Episode 5--""Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival""--Monk hates carnivals and circuses, but when a friend of Stottlemeyer is framed for a crime at a carnival, Monk takes the case and in doing so tries to prove to the Captain that he's ready to be reinstated to the police force.

Episode 6--""Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum""--when Monk comes home to an apartment that's not his, Sharona and the Captain convince him to check into an asylum.  While there, Monk becomes convinced that chief psychiatrist committed a murder committed a murder on the grounds years ago.

Episode 7--""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger""--a local software billionaire is shot by an ex-police officer in what appears to be a random mugging during which a police officer flees the scene of the crime.  Nothing in the case makes any sense.  Meanwhile, after her paycheck bounces, Sharona quicks working for Adrian.

Episode 8--""Mr. Monk and the Other Woman""--a series of murders leads Stottlemeyer to believe that a blonde woman who looks a little like Monk's wife Trudy is the culprit.  However, he only has circumstantial evidence and a hunch and to make matters worse, Monk finds himself falling for the woman.

Episode 9--""Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man""--a woman is murdered during the San Francisco marathon and the prime suspect is her lover.  The problem is that the man was running in the marathon during the time of the murder.

Episode 10--""Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation""--Monk takes a vacation with Sharona and her ten-year-old son, Benjy.  Benjy is convinced he sees a man murdered through a window, but there's no body or evidence.  Sharona thinks that Benjy's imagination is running on overtime and that he has grown attached to Monk, but Adrian believes Benjy and tries to help him solve the crime.

Episode 11--""Mr. Monk and the Earthquake""--a major earthquake in San Francisco leaves Monk shaken, but believes that a murderer has used the disaster as a cover-up for his crime.  Also, Monk meets Sharona's sister.

Episode 12--""Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger""--after a verbal confrontation with his manager, Willie Nelson becomes the prime suspect in the man's murder, but the only witness to the crime is a blind woman.

Episode 13--""Mr. Monk and the Airplane""--tricked by Sharona into taking a trip to visit her aunt in New Jersey, Monk becomes convinced that a fellow passenger murdered his wife and the woman sitting next to him is an imposter.  Monk has to solve the case and the body has to be found before the plane leaves and the suspected couple leaves for Europe.

The DVD includes five behind the scenes featurettes and that's it. They are all very short and not very entertaining or informative.  The only two I found any interest in were ""Mr. Monk and His Origins"" because it gives some information about the creation of the character and ""Mr. Monk and His Partners in Crime"" because it has actors from the show (not Tony Shalhoub) talking about their characters.",1235260800,2,6761,4.8121212121212125

The majority of the shows these days are just trash because they are pushing a gay agenda or have people in relationships outside of marraige. I am teaching my children these things are wrong so I sure do not want to see that or WORSE on TV shows.  Shame on you NBC, CBS and ABC...

Monk is a fresh breath! It is addictive, interesting, funny - we all just love it!!

2009503,5,B0001KL5IU,"MONK has been compared with other crime-solving series, like ""MURDER SHE WROTE meets COLUMBO,"" etc.  But the series I first thought to compare it to, myself, was LONGSTREET.  James Franciscus played Mike Longstreet, an insurance investigator, whose beloved wife was killed by the same bomb that blinded him.  This, too, was an excellent (though short-lived) series in which the main character struggled with a disability, even using it to his advantage in solving crimes.  Like Adrian Monk, Mike Longstreet also had a network of caring, multi-skilled friends helping him.  That series was completely serious, though, with none of the quirky humor of MONK.  (Nevertheless, I'd like to have it on DVD, too.)

If you know--or live with--someone with compulsions similar to Adrian Monk's, you will watch MONK and smile in recognition...and no little sadness.  Tony Shalhoub portrays his character wonderfully.  Thank you.",1233360000,,917,5.401408450704225

Like the subtle humor, the discomfort for those around him but he is oblivious of their emotional state in dealing with them.  Superb acting by Tony Shalhoub in the lead character Adrian Monk - I can't think of anyone doing better in that role.",1231459200,,506,4.419354838709677
2009525,4,B0001KL5IU,"Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky. But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective.

And the first season of ""Monk"" succeeds in bringing an odd twist to the traditional detective TV show. Tony Shalhoub shines as everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive detective, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.

Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely and had to leave the police force. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) babysitting him.

When a politician is nearly killed in a mystery shooting, the police are baffled. So Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) reluctantly calls in his old pal to solve the case. From then on, Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (""It's a gift.... and a curse"") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.

The cases that follow are no less confounding -- Monk must deal with a supposed psychic, a grotesquely obese financier who is unable to get out of bed, a stabbing on a Ferris wheel, a murder in an asylum, a billionaire mugger, a marathon alibi, a vacation gone wrong, an earthquake, a date, a murderous Frenchman, and a murder seemingly committed by Willie Nelson.

""Monk"" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, the fact that it lasted even one season -- let alone several -- is nothing short of miraculous. The first season is not quite the best, but it's a thoroughly solid basis for this comedy/mystery series.

There are gunfights and pperwork, like on any cop show, but the main focus here is on detecting. And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes, which only Monk could unravel. Not to mention the dialogue, which leans heavily on dry humour (""You've got to be a little skeptical, Sharona. Otherwise you end up believing in everything -- UFOs, elves, income tax rebates..."")

But the series wouldn't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub. He played weird roles in movies like MIB and ""Galaxy Quest,"" and so he knows how to balance out Monk's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either. And he does a brilliant job with Monk's devotion to his late wife Trudy, which is so strong and pure that you'd never known years had passed.

Schram serves as the Watson to Monk, and her hard-edged New York single mom is a nice foil -- especially since it's her job to keep him in contact with reality. And while Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford seem rather cold to Monk initially, once they warm up they become excellent police counterpoints to Monk, as genial police chief Stottlemeyer and his earnest (if slightly goofy) sidekick Randy Disher.

The first season of ""Monk"" is a solid start to a smart, unique comedy/mystery serie, with plenty of unsolvable crimes and strange problems. I's a gift... and a curse.",1231459200,2,3231,4.902930402930403

Tony Shalhoub is note-perfect as the title character, whom you can't help but feel sorry for since the murder of his beloved wife. This trauma apparently exacerbated the already existent OCDs, requiring his assistant, played by the wonderful Bitty Schram, to accompany him almost everywhere.
Ted Levine does a fine job as well, playing Monk's police chief.  He is often taken aback by the troubled detective's behavior but also knows that nobody can solve a case better than Monk can.

2009562,4,B0001KL5IU,"My wife, Jen, likes to wash her hands.  Let me explain further.  Every time we eat, touch a stray cat, lick the trashcans, or just plain hug, she likes to wash those cute little nubbins of hers with anti-bacterial soap.  Strange?  How about this personal story.  Dented cans.  Heard of them?  Well, every time we are at the grocery store, when it comes to the cans, we must inspect, feel, and insure that no dents are hiding for fear of a little disease known as botulism.  These are the things I love the most, but I wouldn't call them crazy - to her face at least.  With these little idiosyncrasies in place, we have been itching to see a TV series that has been awarded several accolades through its already planned six seasons, aptly titled ""Monk"".  It is a simple show, or at least the first season is, in which a highly intelligent detective overcomes his phobias (as far ranging as they are) to solve crimes and give us the classic ""Scooby-Doo"" ending, where Monk typically pulls the mask of some unsuspecting criminal.  As stated before, this is a simple show, not your run-of-the-mill ""CSI"" where bodies co-exist with blood and scantily clad women, this is more along the PG rated level, but please, don't be discerned, this is smarter, funnier, and more exciting than Grissom saying, ""There is always a clue"".  In my eyes, there is always a Monk.

Tony Shalhoub, who typical stands behind the leading man in most films, takes helm of this originally small series, and transforms it into a masterpiece.  He masters the mannerisms of someone that may be experiencing the phobias and compulsions that do exist in the modern world.  Alas, he at times does over-push the limits, but it works because it isn't some big name star trying to outwit himself each time.  There is a heart to Shalhoub's character, which, in my eyes, makes for better watching than gritty realism.  This first season doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on the possibilities that Monk has in store for us.  What brings this series into full swing, and pulls the viewer closer to Monk is the unknown of his past.  Through each episode we are given small nibbles of the past; how he lost his wife, the birth of his condition, and his reasoning for being discharged from the force.  We grow with this in the first episode, and it only gets better in time ... I mean with each episode.

If I were to complain, it would be a very small two - meaning I only have two small issues with the show.  The first being the change of structure from the original premiere.  Originally, we didn't see the culprit until the very ending, allowing Monk to bask in the glow of his own discoveries - I liked this opportunity.  It allowed me to solve the clues with Monk and see if his eyes were similar to mine.  The second has to do with continuity, and I feel that this may be an issue with my own personal preference, but I would have liked to have smaller sub-plots which would have led to a surprising cliffhanger of a season finale.  I loved the story of Monk and his lost wife, but I wanted more to do with this, more meat to go with the potatoes of the show.  There was one episode, ""Mr. Monk meets Dale the Whale"" in which we are given a glimpse of the darkness surrounding the events leading to Monk's wife's death, but that is it.  It was almost as if that episode went too far, and afterwards they pulled back too quickly.  Again, those were small issues compared the the impressiveness of this first season.  It has plenty of room to grow, and I think each of our main central characters, Disher, Stottlemeyer, and even Sharona will continue to impress as we grow with them.

Overall, I am eager (yet, oddly, not jumping) to begin the next season.  I wanted a stronger finisher than what was presented, but with ""Monk"" it isn't about the bells and whistles, it is about solving crimes and overcoming obstacles that maybe are normal challenges in our lives.  The bombardment of celebrity involvement near the end (Willie Nelson, Amy Sedaris, and Tim Daly) only shows the growth and popularity that this program was already beginning to see near the end of the first season.  Again, I am excited, but not ""Lost"" excited about our next season.  I want to see ""Monk"" grow - it has the potential - let's see if the creators take it to that next level.

Keyboards kinda gross - Monk would be disappointed.

These are some of the best and go a long way to establishing all the quirks that make Monk so wonderfuly...Monk.  I could watch these several times and always find something new to laugh about.

I was very disappointed.",1173398400,5,313,4.7592592592592595
2009605,5,B0001KL5IU,"I have always loved watching mystery series, personally being a big fan of suspense stories and especially the symbolic players in this arena such as Sherlock Holmes, Poirot and of course Columbo. After watching MONK I was extremely impressed with its quality and effort. Combining the talents of the actors and the stories make this a very memorable series.

The structure of MONK is surprising and engaging in its own way, highlighted by the superb acting talents of its main actors including Tony Shalhoub and Bitty Schram. The stories themselves also provide a fresh outlook on the crime-solving process, and often surprises its audiences with its outcomes and ingenious methods.

An important element of MONK which set it apart from previous crime series would be the action and humor integrated into its plot. This reflects characteristics of modern film, thus making this series much more modern and engaging for audiences of a new generation. Despite minor drawbacks in quality amongst very few episodes, I am pleased to say that I have not been disappointed so far by this series. I highly recommend MONK to all mystery fans or even just for those in for a suspenseful surprise, this is a must-see.",1171929600,3,1207,5.0

Now, it's even better - NO Commercials!!! It is so nice to watch very talented actors ply their craft(!)and know that there is consistency in the writing, acting and directing of this very funny show. Each episode, while staying true to form, contains enough twists to forward the characters and enough comic gems to keep it fresh.

I want to add that I really appreciate how Tony Shaloub portrays Monk not as  a pity case or a mystic freak but as a talented man with a problem. Ok, a really BIG problem, but nonetheless, like the rest of us,he has human aspirations and failings beyond the ocd.

Even the closed captioning did not work (I thought at least I could READ what they were saying).  Amazon gave me a replacement, but it had the same exact problem with the audio on the extra material.

It's about a man (Adrian Monk) who is an ex-cop. He has a nurse/assistant, Sharona Flemming, who helps him out (and gives him wipes after he shakes hands with people). Monk still loves solving mysteries, and the police department turns to him when they have a really baffeling case. He can see things that nobody else notices. The word ""observant"" is nothing to what Monk is. Noticing so many things helps Monk solve mysteries really easily.

Amazon has been great about it.  The TVG people should really warn on their front page that their product will not work with Universal Studios!!  I would NEVER give Monk a 3 star rating.

The relationship between Monk and his nurse (in this case Sharona), his former colleagues at the San Francisco police department and his therapist are delightful and touching.

2009694,5,B0001KL5IU,"My wife and I happened to watch the first few episodes of Monk when it was broadcast on free TV, but we haven't seen it since it moved to cable. I finally bought a season on DVD and immediately upon openning the box, created 5 huge Monk fans. My teenage daughters have devoured almost all 3 seasons available so far, in about 3 weeks.

This is easily the best mystery series since Poirot. We have even skipped Columbo reruns and, my favorite, Perry Mason reruns to watch Monk on DVD. Tony Shaloub is brilliant! The whole cast is outstanding. We were broken hearted when Sharona left, but we have accepted Natalie as a full member of the Monk clan. I have nothing but praise for all of them.

The only thing that bothers me a little is the way the later episodes seem to be spending more and more screen time on Monk's strange physical behaviors. His gyrations are getting a little overblown. But, hey, the rest of the show is good enough to make up for that.

If you have watched Monk on TV, you don't need my recommendation. If you haven't seen Monk, yet, by all means see it. This was the only TV series our local video rental store had. I think that also speaks highly of the show. Highly recommended!",1145145600,6,1204,4.366071428571429

I like these early episodes that show Sharona having to get Monk to focus on the case, not his other obsessions, which are many. This is old fashioned, but entertaining. I appreciate the way the dics are set up and you can choose to watch all episodes continually, or pick a selection.",1142726400,7,576,4.601941747572815
2009696,5,B0001KL5IU,"We became Monk fans with the Season Two DVDs, a family member having tipped us off to the series.  Then, having been effectively and thoroughly hooked, we sought out Season Three and, separately, the premier episode on its separate DVD.  Still unsatiated, we finally acquired the Season One set.  Taking them in that order creates no real problem, since each episode does stand alone.  However, it was interesting to note that Season One's Sharona seemed more compassionate and less bitchy than in later seasons.  But, bitchy or not, we still miss Sharona, although Natalie had become more substantial by the time Season Three ended.  We are eager for Season Four.  Since we refuse to watch broadcast television, the DVDs are our only way to experience the show.

The ensemble cast is great, with Ted Levine and Jason Gray Stanford perfect in their cops-with-mixed-emotions relationship to Monk.  The sub-set between Stottlemeyer and Disher--""Are you ready for this?""  ""Just tell me, Randy!"" is delightful, and I especially enjoyed the way it was echoed in the Mexican cops' interplay when Monk went to Mexico.

Stanley Kramer's Dr. Kroger is equally delightful.  Having operated in a group setting similar to, but not as intense as Kroger's one-on-one therapy sessions, I feel that his character is authentic.

And the kids--both Sharona's and Natalie's--are excellent.

I do feel that the writers sometimes lose sight of the earlier story when they alter some aspect of the past in a later episode.  For instance, in one episode (I forget which one at the moment, but I think that it was in Season Two) Stottlemeyer talks about being a green detective and learning from Monk, but another time his reflection seems to suggest that he was already in charge when Monk started with the department.

Lest it be lost in omission, let it be known that we would never have started with Monk had it not been for the presence of Tony Shalhoub, whose acting we love.  From ""Galaxy Quest,"" to ""The Big Night"" (I still am amazed at how completely Shalhoub disappears in the role of ""Primo""), to ""Impostors,"" the man is a delight as an actor.  Chicago's Ted Levine was the icing on an already great cake for me.  I have grown to appreciate him over the years, although I did not enjoy his Steppenwolf performance in ""Buried Child"" many years ago.

I think that it is the actors, and their characters' relationships, that makes Monk so great, because most of the cases, in themselves, strike me as highly unlikely, and I especially dislike the many ""Columbo""-like openings (I liked Peter Falk, hated the Columbo scripts), where I already know who the killer is.  Yet, because of the characters and their interaction, I persist, and am always rewarded for it.

And, this message to the ""bosses""--please don't get so tight, fiscally, that you lose more of the stellar cast.  Sharona was about all we can bear to lose, I think.  Like Monk,  we mourn, too.",1142208000,7,2939,4.853413654618474

2009698,4,B0001KL5IU,"When this show started it was fresh and had interesting interaction between the characters.  Subsequent seasons are not as consistent and tend to rely on Monk's quirks more than having a balanced episode.  The 1st season is entertaining and are a bit like Columbo episodes in that there is one murder and the main character is an unusual personality.  Tony S. is superb and gives the obsessive compulsive Monk warmth and humor.  It's several steps above Murder She Wrote or Diagnosis Murder which relied on the charisma of the stars.  The supporting cast, especially the character Sharona are just as crucial to the success.",1139356800,,624,4.961538461538462

Funny thing is I suffer from many of his same compulsions MONK experiences however I never saw them as ""compulsions"" before watching this awesome series. I like Monk because he is like a brother to me. If you have a child with High Functioning Autism watch Monk it might give you a few insights into what makes our kind tick while laughing your self silly in the process as well.

Generally MONK is really funny and yet entertaining. Monk is just a little too timid for my tastes but other than that it is a fine series worthy of buying. MONK is on my to buy list for sure. You cannot go wrong with MONK.  If you like LAW and Order and do not mind it mixed with a generous splash of humor you will like Adrian MONK as I do.

It starts off with a very strong opening show.  By now everyone knows what the twist is so I won't rehash it.  The next 8 shows are fun.  Then things start getting a bit weak.  I think the Willie Nelson segment was the worst.  Willie Nelson cannot act.  If you don't believe me watch Honeysuckle Rose which I once saw as the fourth show at a drive-in.  Fortunately he does not even try here.  He does sing.  And there is one funny zinger about Nelson's prior IRS problems.

The plot is also very predictable.  A man is killed in a dead end alley.  In the alley is a blind witness and someone who is angry with the dead man.  No one else is seen entering or leaving.  The really annoying thing is that the case is solved when Monk remembers the significance of something that happened earlier in the show.  Something that any alert viewer is going to catch.

Never has a crime series been presented in such a unique way, one that manages to come off as comical despite the often-serious nature of the cases that Monk has to solve. I'd recommend this to show to anyone, young and old. Weather we like to admit it or not, there's some Monk in everyone one of us. And that's another charm that this show offers. It's a shame that Monk isn't showcased in primetime by one of the major networks, but it being showed on USA hasn't effected viewership and certainly hasn't stopped the show from winning awards.

This DVD showcases all season one episodes, including the two part series opener. The episodes are presented in 1:78:1 widescreen format and generally offer a top-notch picture.

2009796,5,B0001KL5IU,"One of the more clever television creations of the new millennium, Monk combines the high-grade suspense of a traditional TV drama with the quirky humor of a big screen comedy. Originally developed for ABC, the show became an instant prime-time lynchpin for the USA network, proving itself one of the more successful shows on cable TV...

In Monk, Tony Shalhoub stars in the title role of Adrian Monk, a former San Francisco detective placed on psychiatric leave. A true legend in the community, Monk solves unsolvable crimes via his towering intellect, photographic memory, and meticulous observations. But the one case that alludes Monk is the 1997 murder of his wife Trudy, which forever altered Monk's capacity to perform his job. Suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and a number of odd phobias, Monk requires a personal assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), for even his most basic daily activities. Yet Monk remains a police consultant on difficult cases, and he hopes to persuade Capt. Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to give him his old job back. But Stottlemeyer and colleague Lt. Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), harbor doubts about Monk's mental faculties. As Monk solves cases though, those doubts dissipate and Stottlemeyer and Disher learn to appreciate Monk's special talents - despite his inability to cope with the day-to-day activities of a normal detective... Nevertheless, he remains a de facto investigator as he and Sharona aid the San Francisco police department in solving numerous high profile cases...

The Monk (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate"" in which the audience first learns the background of Adrian Monk, a modern day Sherlock Holmes beset by mental problems.

2009797,5,B0001KL5IU,"I'm a new Monk fan, and since I loved the last episodes of Season 3 so much, I just had to buy the Season 1 and 2 DVDs -- and they are, quite simply, wonderful. The writers manage to interject just the right mix of humor, mystery, drama and OCD so that none of the elements overpower one another. This makes for an honest-to-goodness well rounded show. Further, Monk is one of the few shows on television that can still be considered ""family friendly"" -- which is nice deviation from the majority of the ""stuff"" on TV.

If you like a detective mystery without all the fluff and glimmer of CSI or other shock-dramas, Monk is a perfect way to spend an evening. I highly recommend it!",1112572800,2,681,4.362204724409449
2009798,5,B0001KL5IU,"I throughly enjoyed this series of Monk. It is definitely a purchase you won't regret. Monk is both pathetic and comical at the same time. And every episode is equally intriguing, guaranteeing that there is not a moment of boredom. So when asked which is my favorite episode, I really can't answer that. Each episode is nice in its own way.

Tony Shalhoub plays the part of Monk so well and he is just so 'lovable.' Sharona too is such a good combination with Monk.

I definitely want to see Monk - Season 2!",1109808000,2,508,4.3936170212765955
2009799,5,B0001KL5IU,"I came to be familiar with Mr. Monk late in the second season, so I was excited to purchase season one (and yes season two as well).  Our family has enjoyed our very own MONK film festivals each weekend while waiting for the newest installment on Friday nights.  If you love a great mystery-you will fall in love with Monk--OCD and all.  It proves we all have something to overcome. I highly recommend this series.",1109721600,,414,4.493333333333333
2009800,4,B0001KL5IU,"""Monk"" is by far one of the more original detective series out there.  Tony Shalhoub is a very gifted actor who brings charm, wit, and intelligence to a role that could easily have -- in lesser actor's hands -- been contrived and cliche [Side note: for examples of his range watch his comical Antonio Scarpacci character on ""Wings"" and his obsessive cook in the highly underrated movie ""Big Night""].  Although the writing can sometimes be a bit inconsistent the characters more than make up for that.  The show is more light-hearted than most crime shows out there (you won't find the hardcore level of detailed investigative police work that would on, say, the CSI shows and NYPD Blue) but that's the tone it's going for.  The show is a breath of fresh air in a genre that recently feels compelled to bludgeon you with high-speed, invasive camera shots through people's brains, combing through cadavers' stomach contents, and dwelling on casual conversations over the mutilated bodies of women in dimly lit morgues.

I am sad to report that the DVD set is a small disappointment.  One episode in particular, ""Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum"" (featuring an utterly hilarious Kevin Nealon character named John Wurster) you find an entire scene inexplicably cut out -- where Monk and Wurster are in the basement walking through construction in the mental ward.  This episode marks another inconsistency in the writing of the show in that the character of Monk (despite having had time to establish the character in several episodes) displays some wildly inconsistent OCD behavior compared to episodes leading up to and following this episode.  Granted the reason he was admitted in the first place was that he was showing signs of going off the deep end but nevertheless one would have expected more pronounced OCD behavior in such a situation rather than a near-complete ignorance of its previously demonstrated symptoms.

Like many DVD sets the bonus features for this set are on the last disc which, if you're like most people, you won't get to for a few weeks or months (the relevance of which will shortly be apparent).  In my particular case I found myself anticipating the behind-the-scenes interviews and featurettes even as I was deeply enjoying watching the episodes.  Alas when I finally got to the bonus features I discovered that the audio on all bonus material was mysteriously and annoyingly eclipsed by the music from the DVD's menu screen.  I was unable to figure out what the problem was, as I had never seen such a glitch.  Because of the amount of time that lapsed from the time I received it as a gift from my wife and the moment of discovery in the bonus features I am not sure what merchandise exchange options will be available to me.

All in all you will be hard pressed to find a better recent detective comedy on the market today.  If the thought of thirteen 43-minute long, gore-less escapes -- viewed in between your parade of overly realistic and depressing crime dramas -- appeals to you then this is certainly your purchase.",1107993600,5,3050,4.827255278310941
2009801,4,B0001KL5IU,"This is my favorite TV show.  I don't really watch much TV at all, but I try to never miss a new Monk episode.  Monk is the most unique character to come along in quite a while, and Tony Shaloub plays him so well that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  He *is* Adrian Monk.  And it is a joy to watch him in action.

The show's writers are top-notch, as are Monk's co-stars Bitty Schram (as Monk's nurse, Sharona Fleming), Ted Levine (as Captain Leland Stottlemeyer), and Jason Gray-Stanford (as Lt. Randy Disher).  There is a humanness to all of the characters, and a real depth to Monk especially, that makes this show so excellent, and so appealing.

The first season is one of the best, and I was excited to purchase this set, to have these gems in my collection.  The show is now heading in a new direction this season, and I'm not sure I am going to like the direction it is heading.  Bitty Schram has left the show, leaving in my opinion a HUGE void that will not be the least bit easy to fill.  Monk was completely dependent upon Sharona for his needs, and the interplay and frequent tension between the two was one of the marvels of the show.  The replacement for her this season is, quote, ""a world-weary but attractive thirtysomething widow who works as a bartender.""  Ugh.  That doesn't seem like a good fit to me.  We shall see.

The other thing that changed for the worse after the first season was the replacement of the theme song by Jeff Beal with an inferior song.  Beal's theme song is a fantastic instrumental, and it fit the show like a glove.  Just a wonderful feeling to it.  That has been replaced by ""It's A Jungle Out There,"" written and sung by Randy Newman in his inimitable homely voice.  Don't get me wrong; Newman made enjoyable songs for Toy Story and so on, but he is just not the right vibe for Monk.  Just doesn't work very well, and the song itself is simply vastly less enjoyable to listen to than Beal's instrumental.  Newman's characteristic pronunciations get on my nerves, too -- ""Itsa jungul owut theya.""  Anyway, there is none of Newman in this set -- you get the great original theme song.

I am docking this set one star for the anemic ""bonus material.""  The box makes it look like you get a lot -- Mr. Monk and his Origins, OCD, Fellow Sufferers, Emmy Award-Winning Performance, and His Partners In Crime.  But these are all very, very short little features that amount to nothing more than some comments from producers and writers which lack any real depth, interspersed with a few snippets of the show.  All of these individual features could have been just wrapped up into one single bonus feature that wouldn't have lasted very long even at that.  You'll go through the bonus material in nothing flat, and it will give you a flat feeling too, like they could have done a lot, lot more with the bonus stuff.  Also, curiously, ""Randy Disher"" is missing from interviews in the bonus films, though Sharona, Stottlemeyer, and of course Monk are all present.

The DVD also has a short movie preview at the beginning which you can thankfully fast-forward over, but I still hate ads on my DVDs.  The studios seem to think that, well, when you see a movie in the theater, you pay your money and you sit through previews before the movie starts, so having previews at the beginning of DVDs is the same difference.  No, it's not.  People will sit through previews in the movie theater because (a) they look cool on the big screen, and (b) they're previews of something new.  This doesn't translate to DVD.  On DVD, any preview that might have looked great on a gigantic movie screen suddenly just turns into another ""ad"" on your TV set (unless you have a huge home theater).  And on DVD, any preview will cease to become new in short order, so you eventually end up with a ""preview"" of a movie that made its theater run long ago.  I don't want that in my collection, thank you very much.

But besides the one star docked for these quibbles, the other four stars speak for a show that I wish there were more of.  Smartly written, intelligent humor, utterly unique, this show has it all.",1105315200,6,4141,4.472
2009802,4,B0001KL5IU,"Monk is a great show that deftly combines suspense with humor.  Monk played by Tony Shalhoub is a great character that is phobic about just everything.  Despite this he has an uncanny ability to see things others don't in order to solve murders.

2009833,5,B0001KL5IU,"Monk is a detective show, yet it is really funny. Adrian Monk is a ""defective detective"" who is afraid of germs, milk, large crowds, and pretty much everything. But he is able to figure out even some of the wierdest murders. There's nothing that can stump him.

2009834,5,B0001KL5IU,"Monk is about a man named Adrian Monk, who is a private detective that has a disability, he is obsessive about anything, not to mention that he is afraid of practically anything.

He was at first a cop himself, however his wife was murdered in a car bomb that took place four years before the actuall time in the series takes place. It is the only mystery that Monk cant solve and because of that and the loss of his wife, he is forced to leave the force and get help.

But the series is far from depressing. Monk actually takes part in some of the most bizarre murders in San Francisco's history [Where the series takes place] whenever the police are stumped. He goes from place to place with his nurse and good friend, Sharona Flemming, as he questions the suspects.

In the end of each episode, he manages to prove the guilty murderer why and how he or she, or sometimes both, did the crime. And each time he solves it the ending is still surprising and has lots of twists that all tie in the weird clues that Monk finds in the beginning and middle of each episode.

The set includes four DVDs with 3 episodes each:

Disk one: Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Mr. Monk meets the psychic, Mr. Monk meets Dale the whale.

Disk two: Mr. Monk  goes to the carnival, Mr. Monk goes to the asylum, Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger.

Disk three: Mr. Monk and the other woman, Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man, Mr. Monk takes the vacation.

Disk four: Mr. Monk and the Earthquake, Mr. Monk meets the Red Headed stranger [Special guest Willie Nelson], and Mr. Monk and the airplane.

Each episode is about 45 minutes, besides the opening which is about an hour and a half. Each mystery is as bizarre as the next:

From a billionaire killed after trying to mug a couple, to an 800 pound man accused of murder despite the fact he cant even fit through his door. And even to where Monk finds a crime scene that some cops are calling, ""The cleanest crime scene ever."" And one includes Willie Nelson being accused of murder.

2009837,5,B0001KL5IU,"For years, I had believed that television was dead: Aside from occasionally watching the one sitcom left that was intelligently written, ""Frasier,"" I sadly witnessed that most sitcoms -- such as ""Friends"" and ""Will and Grace"" -- were ""dumbed down,"" filmed in 10-to-15 second segments, in order to cater to the ADHD, MTV generation. Even the so-called ""serious"" dramas, such as ""The West Wing"" and ""ER"" are basically a clumsy piling on of stale platitudes and disease and/or crisis of the week ephemeral plotting. As for ""reality"" shows, I have nothing to say about that sorry genre save that, strangely, I have never been plucked out of my boring life, put on a deserted isle, surrounded by a dozen hot babes while eating worms and maggots, in hopes of working for Donald Trump, should I emerge victorious.

Then, all of the sudden, in the Summer of 2002, my wife and I stumbled across this show, ""Monk."" What can I say? ""Monk"" is one of those programs that only comes along every generation or so. It is so gratifying to finally watch a program that mixes light comedy, captivating mystery, taut suspense and intelligent dialogue. Bravo!

""Monk"" revolves around its central character, the eccentric savant and super-sleuth, Adrian Monk, played with understated erudition by Tony Shalhoub. Monk, who's been felled by the tragic murder of his beautiful wife, Trudy, has a tough time being reinstated to the San Francisco Police Department because of his Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Half Perry Mason and half Felix Unger, he is a walking library of esoteric information hindered by a thousand phobias.

His nurse, gal-Friday and sidekick is the streetwise and sexy Sharona Fleming, who's on hand to help Adrian overcome his OCD and to dispense antibacterial wipes to protect him from viral infection and dangerous human elements after shaking hands. Monk's OCD provides a lot of comedic moments and plot points, but without ever becoming preachy or belittling.

Monk and Sharona are definitely television's best couple, even though their relationship is platonic. While he exists almost exclusively in his own cerebral and abstract world, world-wise Sharona provides the intuition to navigate him through the world populated by the rest of humanity. She's also the perfect foil for his awkward personality quirks. Without Sharona, Monk would literally be incomplete.

Ted Levine plays Monk's former boss, Captain Stottlemeyer, with gruff aplomb. Reluctantly, he hires Monk free lance as a consultant when the SFPD can't crack the case. Jason Gray-Stanford gives more comic relief as the boyish Disher, an earnest yet somewhat slow-witted detective on the force who would never solve one of Monk's mysteries, even if given 1000 years.

In this boxed set are 12 episodes from the first season, including the pilot, ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate,"" so buyers, please, you don't need to buy the pilot episode separately, unless you are a completist with OCD, like Adrian Monk. The best episodes are: ""Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum,"" which features an offbeat guest appearance by Kevin Nealon; ""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger,""; ""Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation; and, most hilariously, ""Mr. Monk and the Airplane,"" in which our hero manages to annoy all the plane's passengers with his finicky behavior while solving a murder.

""Monk"" is superbly cast and brilliantly executed. The photography is gorgeous, the filmstock ripe with rich hues and deep shadows. I disagree with one previous reviewer who implied that the sound ""suffices,"" because it is merely in Dolby 5.1 stereo. I say the sound is perfect: Though in stereo surround, it is never overbearing, never dominating the picture with ""whoosh and clang"" foley effects.

One little imperfection: ""Monk"" is supposed to be set in San Francisco, so one would think that our protagonist would take note of the Bell Canada service trucks and phone booths that inexplicably pop up in its episodes. Uncanny.

Unfortunately, USA Network will not be bringing back Bitty Schram as Sharona next season. Monk needs his better half. Save Sharona! Visit the petition to keep her on the show:

Sharona- divorced single mother with sense and helpful sidekick.  Captain - with eccentric wife and loyal friend.  The detective- bring a love-hate comedy relationship with Sharona.

2009873,5,B0001KL5IU,"Monk is one of the best tv series out there- I'd even go further and say, it's one of the best tv series ever.  The writing is brilliant- subtle comedy and some dark humor found throughout every episode...the concept is original- a genius detective with OCD, who battles the disease while trying to solve complex cases for the police...all while trying to get his life back on track to the point where he can rejoin the force.

Shaloub is a wonderful actor who does the character of Adrian Monk complete justice.  He's been awarded for his role with an emmy, and it's well deserved.  The rest of the cast are just as wonderful, filling out the areas that Monk can't fill himself very nicely.

The series is very professional in it's look- the dp on this series has done a great job...and it really helps that after season 1, they moved actual shooting to San Francisco, instead of the, almost surely, Canadian city they used as a look-alike.

The series also has great music, most of the scoring done by the guy who did the original season 1 theme song- a much better version than the dark Randy Newman theme used for season 2 and ever since.

There is nothing bad to say about this series- it's always a joy to watch Monk solve the crimes, dealing with his disease, and lauhging along with everything that takes place.  This is the very definition of great television.

A note about the DVD itself, and why I would rate the set a 2 or 3 and the show a 5- there's very little here added on.  You would think that a hit series like this would have some commentaries or indepth behind-the-scenes stuff, but all it has is 4 or 5 short behind-the-scenes segments about the show and about the illness and how the creators came up with the idea.  There are no commentary tracks, nor any longer documentary-style segments on the set.  The audio is dolby 5.1, I believe, and it's in letterbox- very nice for both, but I would have liked to see some commentary tracks, and more bonus material- it's a little weak for such a popular series if you ask me.",1093046400,7,2044,4.450402144772118
2009874,5,B0001KL5IU,"The concept for this series is ingenious. Adrian Monk is a private investigator with a host of fears and obsessions. He used to be on the police force, but when his wife was murdered, he could no longer function. Now with the help of his nurse Sharona, he is working to become reinstated.

Monk works as a consultant on any case that has the police stumped. He simply sees connections the others cannot. We learn that his obsessions are both a blessing and a curse.

This season is a great start, but season two and three are even better. The highlights in this season are:

1. Mr. Monk and the Candidate- the double episode pilot. The tone for this episode is a little darker than the others, but it gets the series off to an interesting start.

2. Mr. Monk goes on Vacation- There is just something funny about Monk lying by the pool while wearing a suit. Benjy witnesses a murder and Mr. Monk is the only person who believes him.

3. Mr. Monk and the Earthquake- When a celebrated philantropist dies in an earthquake can Monk prove that it was actually murder? This episode contains what I consider the best scene in the season. Just imagine Monk's reaction to an earthquake. I won't spoil this scene.

4. Mr. Monk and the Airplane- The best episode in this season. Mr. Monk identifies and solves a case all while on a cross country flight. Has a great scene in which Randy surveys the crime scene with the same mannerisms Monk uses. Gary Marshall plays an extension cord salesman.

I knew of Tony Shalhoub from a few TV series and films that he is great in, but almost always a side character.  He's really given an opportunity to shine in Monk.

The DVD set is great.  The video is wonderful.  Very clean.  The audio is great EXCEPT for the bonus material.  The bonus material suffers from being inversed.  Meaning on a four speaker setup the sound is very loud out of the back speakers and very quiet in the front.  So if you're running through a receiver with only two front speakers you might hear nothing on the bonus material.  It works fine on 2.0 systems like computers.  Personally the strange audio isn't a deal breaker for me.

 So why only four stars? Perhaps I received a slightly defective DVD, but on my player, some of the dubbing is off. Enough that it is noticeable and annoying. Also, the special features portion did not have sound. There was music, but no voices.

 Fortunately, I was able to borrow someone else's copy of the DVD to hear the special features. To me, this is one of the greatest things about DVDs -- those special features, and Monk First Season is no exception to this.

 Overall, this season is great for your collection, whether you've seen the episodes before or never seen Monk in your life. It is so much fun watching Monk work and ""play"" that you will be lost in his world. And your problems could never be as bad as his!

 My personal favorite episode is Mr. Monk and the Airplane. In this episode, Monk is forced to fly with Sharona. The entire episode takes place on the airplane where his fears, compulsions, and obsessions take full force, and where he manages to solve a couple mysteries. As a person with a fear of flying myself, this episode had me laughing all the way through.

 This show only gets better over time. The first season was good. The second season was great! And the third season -- well, you catch my drift. Slowly we learn about Monk's real life -- and Sharona's, too. Will Monk ever solve the mystery closest to him -- what happened to his wife Trudy? I know I'll be trying to solve that mystery right along with him.

 Each episode of Monk is only about 40 minutes long without commercials. Perfect!",1091318400,14,1747,4.459119496855346

Even for me, not a big detective fan, the show is entertaining and fun. And watching the episodes on DVD, without ads breaking up the flow, makes it MUCH better. Thumbs up!",1090800000,,333,4.138461538461539

2009913,5,B0001KL5IU,"Monk's first season is some of the best comedy/drama that has been on TV in years. Tony Shaloub is a gifted actor, and breathes life and believability into the character of Mr. Monk. Monk's daily struggle with OCD is at time funny and because of Tony Shaloub's portrayal, touching. We can see that Monk hates being trapped by his OCD, even if the disease is a contributing factor to his Sherlock Holmesian power of observation. All of the episodes in season one are enjoyable. Watching Monk chase a suspect through a sewer in ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate"" is hilarious. The interaction between Monk and his nurse/assistant Sharona is fun to watch. In episodes ""Mr. Monk takes a Vacation"" and ""Mr. Monk and the Airplane"", the back and forth between the characters is a riot. I think the highlight of this box set is ""Mr. Monk and Red Headed Stranger"". Some of the subtle jokes about Willie Nelson are great!! And the ending of that episode is very touching. Ted Levine, the actor who played the serial killer in ""Silence of the Lambs"" plays Detective Stottlemeyer (sp?), and is really good at playing the straight man to Monk.
If you enjoy mysteries, that don't involve shoot outs and soap opera (NYPD Blue), or mysteries that don't just pander to the geriatric set (Diagnosis Murder & Matlock), then Monk is for you. With outstanding writing, and a great cast Monk: Season One is Highly Recommended!!",1089676800,4,1399,4.737704918032787

If you have not seen it - you are missing something great, fresh, and so unlike other shows on the tube!  Cannot wait for the 2nd season to be released!",1089676800,,294,4.214285714285714

2009916,5,B0001KL5IU,"I can't help but wonder....If Sherlock Holmes had OCD, would he have been as funny as Monk?
Surely not. But Monk does owe his outstanding deductive reasoning skills to Holmes and, more directly, to Conan Doyle. The only derivative aspect that marks the show is that very skill. That being said, it is easy to forgive the series this fact. Most modern day mystery minded television and literature nods to Conan Doyle and, beyond him, Poe. And when something works so well and so effectively, why change it? It's still just as exhilirating to have Monk point out the origin of a callus on the left forefinger as it was when Rathbone in the guise of Holmes did something quite similar. As far as I'm concerned, it makes for great television (or film, for that matter.)
But what's the real reason to watch MONK? Because it is undoubtedly one of the absolute funniest television shows that you will ever hope to watch. In actuality there is nothing humorous about OCD. But the show not being reality, and the intelligence, emotion, and determination behind Monk's character, seem to make it okay to laugh. And laugh you will. Not smile, not chuckle, but full on contagious laughter. The kind that creates a well of euphoria in the pit of your stomach after you've finished. The kind that comes forth again when you recall a particular scene or bit of dialogue the next day. And what's even better is that the comedy inherent in Monk owes nothing to the slapstick that always prompted laughter in ""comedies"" of the past. It's intelligent and thoughtful. And it's carried off beautifully by Tony Shalhoub.
Shalhoub is adorable. He makes you believe in his character and you rally behind him whenever he encounters something he is afraid of. He deserves every accolade he garners for this show. And each of the cast members that surrounds him adds to the overall delight and humor of MONK.
I can only hope and cross my fingers that this show will remain on the air for a long time to come. And that they will manage to keep it as fresh and as funny as it is. My suggestion would be to watch the new season--it's even funnier than the first--at the same time as the episodes included in this first season set. For my family, a week isn't complete without a dose of MONK.",1089072000,15,2261,4.599009900990099
2009917,5,B0001KL5IU,"I will admit it, right at the beginning, that it would be very difficult to disappoint me with anything MONK-related. Nevertheless, this DVD set of the first season is so entertaining and interesting that I was glued to the set for hours. As a collector of all-things MONK, I was ecstatic to receive 2 shows (Marathon Man and Red-Headed Stranger) that I had never seen before. The additional featurettes were excellent and I even learned some new things about MONK and OCD I never knew before. All the MONK characters are so excellent and the shows so well-written that they can be watched again and again. Yay Tony Shalhoub (he is great in EVERYTHING he does) and YAY MONK",1088726400,,673,4.663865546218488
2009918,5,B0001KL5IU,"I blew it.  I didn't start watching this show until it's second season.  Little did I know what I was missing.
Tony Shalhoub stars as Adrian Monk, a former police detective no longer on the force because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder and his phobias.  He does still consult on some of their most bizarre cases, however.  For example, how could an 800-lb. man commit murder?  Why was a billionaire killed while mugging a man on a date?  Did a fellow airline passenger really kill his wife?  How could a man commit murder and run a marathon at the same time?
This series falls into the classic puzzle mystery genre, my personal favorite.  Sometimes I have an idea why or how, but it takes the ending for me to know for sure.  More often then not, I'm stumped.  Along the way, we get plenty of laughs at the various situations we find Mr. Monk in.  The obsessive-compulsive disorder and his fears are handled just right.  They provide the clues needed and humor without being over the top or annoying.
Of course, the series is helped by its actors.  Tony Shalhoub is excellent as Monk with a performance just slightly understated.  He deserved his Emmy win for this season.  Just as praise worthy is Bitty Schram as Monk's nurse Sharona.  She mixes exasperated and compassionate while providing a strong sidekick character that doesn't get lost behind the lead.  Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford as the police Monk helps and Stanley Kamel as Monk's shrink are equally excellent.
The writing is sharp and manages to find humor without mocking Monk, a subtle but clear distinction.
This DVD set is great for old and new fans alike.  All twelve first season episodes are present, including the previously released two-hour pilot.  They're presented in widescreen and look sharp.  The sound, while presented in 5.1 surround, is nothing spectacular.  Still, it gets the job done.  Disc four has some short extras discussing the creation of the show, obsessive-compulsive disorder, the cast and crew's obsessions, the Emmy win, and the casting of Bitty Schram and Ted Levine.  I would have loved a commentary track or two and some outtakes, but they aren't to be found here.
While the extras could have been just a tad better, this set is a must have for those who love light mystery.  It was nice to catch the cases I'd missed.  This is one mystery show you can watch time and time again for the humor and character even if you remember how it ends.",1087603200,152,2450,4.721698113207547
