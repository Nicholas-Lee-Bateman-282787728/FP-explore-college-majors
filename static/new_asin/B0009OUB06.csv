2307999,5,B0009OUB06,"Volume 9 of Disney's Classic Cartoon Favroites, Classic Holiday Stories, contains only 3 shorts; because The Small One and Mickey's Christmas Carol are just over 25 minutes each! Pluto's Christmas Tree is the one sandwiched right in the middle, and all 3 are beloved Christmas classics for generations. Some folks say The Small One was edited here and in volume 7 of Disney's Animation Collection from 2009; well, better to have it like it is than not to have it on authorized DVDs at all, as I always remembered it since my first time seeing it on Disney Channel in 1998, for its 20th anniversary. If you listen and pay attention, the unnamed boy of The Small One was played by Sean Marshall, who played Pete on Pete's Dragon, just one year before The Small One came out, right down to how they laugh! The other 2 shorts have been family traditions of mine since I was a baby, or at least a little kid. I'm sure lots of other families feel the same way when they were televised LONG ago, at least uncut. The Oscar-nominated/star-studded holiday classic Mickey's Christmas Carol is presented in Fullscreen here and in volume 7 of the 2009 shorts collection, as the 2013 DVD/Blu-ray release caused an uproar by how it AND The Sword in the Stone were seen in their 2013 DVD/Blu-ray releases; seemingly Faux-Widescreen compared to earlier releases like this disc here, and its 2009 remake which contains an edited version of Santa's Workshop, which was noticeably more so when on TV in 2014, on Turner Classic Movies of all places! (No kidding, I saw it there edited with my own eyes!) Like I keep saying, just be thankful for what you have, since Disney doesn't seem to bother with fixing up Mickey's Christmas Carol & The Sword in the Stone's latest releases, and especially with making The Small One remastered and completely uncut for an all-new DVD/Blu-ray release, even with social media ablaze with such big boo-boos. Nutsy, isn't it? But all 12 volumes of Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites collection are nowhere near THAT nutsy!",1425340800,,2035,4.767705382436261

2308021,4,B0009OUB06,"Definitely a classic to me. I remember watching Mickey's Christmas Carol as a child. Now that I'm older, it seems so short. :) And The Small One is a total bonus. Wonderful story and fun with the songs. My only negative is I wish there were more on this volume. There's only 3 cartoons in total. Worth the buy anyway.",1389398400,,317,4.3
2308022,5,B0009OUB06,"I've been watching these cartoons at Christmas time for as long as I could remember, so naturally I had to have the DVD collection as an adult. Good find and a must see for any Disney lover.",1388534400,,190,4.162162162162162
2308023,5,B0009OUB06,"I got this for 2 of the movies on it...I didn't honestly care about the other one, but there are three movies on here. One about Pluto chasing Chip and Dale all over the Christmas tree...And then Mickey's Christmas Carol and The Small One. I got it for The Small One and Christmas Carol...in my opinion, two of the best movies Disney ever did. If you like the old Mickey Mouse and the classic Disney movies before Disney turned into the sappy crappy mess it is today and before they reinvented Mickey Mouse into a jerk...then this is a great movie set for you. I love The Small One. It's the perfect Christmas story!",1388534400,3,616,4.412280701754386

2308026,4,B0009OUB06,"While there are some other supporting features on the disc, Mickey's Christmas Carol is the reason to buy this. That was my first introduction to the Charles Dickens classic, and it still holds up after all this time as a surprisingly faithful adaptation. The other shorts are cute in their way, but they're side dishes to the main course of Scrooge McDuck learning his life lesson.",1377129600,,382,4.803030303030303
2308027,5,B0009OUB06,"All three of these stories were played on repeat at Christmas when I was a child, so it was truly a joy to find them all on DVD!

It was a great gift for my mother. Thank you so much!",1362355200,,383,4.1891891891891895

2308031,3,B0009OUB06,"Bought this DVD before I had kids, since I loved Mickey's Christmas Carol as a child. I think my parents had taped it off the TV.  Was please to find it so cheap on DVD.  Now that I have kids, it is even more valuable.  My daughter (age 3) loves all three movies on the disc. It is a great way to get her excited for Christmas.",1346716800,,327,3.8507462686567164

2308033,5,B0009OUB06,I purchased this DVD specifically for the story of Small One (my favorite childhood story). I loved the animated story on this DVD. The two other great stories included (A Christmas Carol and Pluto's Tree) were a bonus! A great buy indeed! :-),1324166400,,243,4.674418604651163
2308034,5,B0009OUB06,"Every time these would air on TV I'd be out or forget! Argh! I finally just decided to buy them! So happy to see they were all on on disc. Now, I watch them every year at my leisure :)",1292630400,,184,3.625

2308037,5,B0009OUB06,Everything was taken care of quickly and I'm happy to do business with this seller.,1269993600,,83,4.6
2308038,5,B0009OUB06,"Among the best DVDs in my Christmas collection, all three of the included featurettes are top-notch releases...and I'm not even a big Disney fan.

""The Small One,"" a tearjerker from 1978 directed by Don Bluth, is the story of a young boy and an old little donkey, and what ends up happening to them on the first Christmas (although that aspect of the story ends up being secondary). Small One must be sold because he's become of no practical use to the boy's family. The animation in this feature is spectacular and you'll find yourself wondering why other releases from the same era couldn't have held to this standard. Wonderful storytelling in that classic Disney style.

""Pluto's Christmas Tree,"" a great Christmastime short from 1952 featuring Chip and Dale and their battle with Pluto over (or in) Mickey's Christmas tree. Funny and warm and  just plain great.

""Mickey's Christmas Carol,"" the usual story told with Disney characters, from 1983. It actually feels older than that, feels more classically Disney even though by that time Disney had long since abandoned the regular use of these characters in animated releases. Mickey gets top billing even though he plays the Cratchit character and it's Scrooge McDuck who plays, of course, Scrooge. Those familiar with Donald Duck's usual antics will be surprised as his appearance here as a very sweet and kindhearted nephew Fred. Fantastic, first-rate fare even though it might feel a little rushed at only 25 minutes.",1261612800,,1476,5.012244897959183
2308039,4,B0009OUB06,"This DVD contains three features for your Christmas celebration.  All three are considered shorts, so they clock in at just under an hour combined.

Up first was the new to DVD ""The Small One.""  This story tells the tale of a boy who must go to town to sell his favorite donkey.  After an all day search, he finds a man who needs a donkey to carry his pregnant wife to Bethlehem.  Yes, I did the references to the Biblical story a bit surprising.  There are some fun moments here, but for the most part, it was rather bland.

The other two features were also released as part of Mickey Mouse in Living Color Vol. 2.  Up first is ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" which finds Pluto trying to defend Mickey's house and their decorations from Chip 'n' Dale.  I always forget just how much fun this one is.

Finally, there's ""Mickey's Christmas Carol.""  It attempts to tell the story of the Dickens classic in less than half an hour, and mostly succeeds.  It's entertaining and the best thing here.

This disc was released in 2005.  So, as Disney always does, it is now out of print.  But the good news is they released a disc titled Mickey's Christmas Carol this year that has all three of these cartoons on it plus one more.",1260403200,2,1213,4.400900900900901

2308045,5,B0009OUB06,"So, my little girl was hooked on the Christmas Carol that I tivoed this Christmas and kept requesting it.  I also love the story.  The fact that the DVD also contained the cartoon with Pluto and the chipmunks in the tree was a bonus.  The first cartoon, Small One, is a little too sad for small children, but the other two make up for it and then some.  You can skip right to the good cartoons on the menu--great feature.",1234742400,,421,4.225

Apparently, I was wrong in assuming they no longer were interested in this movie as they were distraught at Christmas time looking for their 'beloved' movie.  Yeah, I found it and all is better.

2308051,5,B0009OUB06,"My husband and I saw ""The Small One"" as a short subject with a longer Disney film when it first came out.  We have watched it every Christmas since we acquired it on VHS about 20 years ago.  I was thrilled to get this crisp, vibrant DVD copy as a Christmas present this year.  Even after all these years, the short (26 min) story captivates and moves me (I cry at least once during each viewing).  The animation is good, but not Disney's best - although it is filled with lovely natural touches (every parent can relate to the Father's rubbing his forehead with frustration when he agrees to let his son take the donkey to sell).  I recommend ""The Small One"" - and the other two cartoons on this DVD - to everyone who loves Christmas.",1231632000,,734,4.328467153284672

2308054,5,B0009OUB06,Mickey's Christmas Carol has been a tradition in my household for years. This year we continued the tradition with our 4 yr. old twins who absolutely loved the whole DVD.

Mickey's Christmas Carol was one.  Amazon search kept bringing me to this title so I read some of the reviews and realized that it was one of 3 shows on the dvd.  Small One I don't recall seeing or hearing before so can't comment.  But Pluto's Tree and Xmas Carol were both on the vhs tape I remember as a kid.  SO 2 out of 3 ain't bad.

The little donkey is so loveable and the story line just tugs at the heart.",1217116800,,337,4.451612903225806

After watching these cartoons with my nieces on a 20 year-old VHS tape, I was shocked to find that the voices of the characters were not supposed to sound as if they were underwater.  My only complaint was that were not more shows included on this DVD but for $9.00 it was a pretty good deal.

I was excited since this DVD also includes two short movies I hadn't seen previously: The Small One and Pluto's Christmas Tree. The Small One was so heart-warming and brought tears to my eyes, while Pluto's Christmas Tree and his capers with the chipmunks were absolutely hilarious!

I had it on VHS recorded off the TV in the 80's so the quality wasn't too good and have wanted it on DVD for ages.

It really is a classic Disney short cartoon that really pulls at the heart strings. I'm 22 now and it still made me cry! It's a shame more people don't know about it. When I have kids I hope they'll enjoy it as much as I did and still do!

""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" is cute and fun for little ones. ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" only barely follows the story, but is essentially correct - only frustrating if you've actually read the original. Excellent for children 3-9 & their parents.",1199232000,,399,5.25
2308078,5,B0009OUB06,This dvd is a great example of classic cartoons. They don't make them like this anymore. Small One is about a boy who has to sell his beloved donkey and is looking for just the right person to care and love for him. A very sweet story.

2308087,5,B0009OUB06,"It might not be an authentic adaptation  of Charles Dickens's tale. But the 1985 special has really good animation for the era when it was produced.

As the Ghost of Christmas Future, Pete does a really good job of scaring Scrooge McDuck into permanently changing his formerly miserly ways. He makes Bob his partner and becomes an ally to Tiny Tim--and the other Cratchit children.

That ghost's closing scene and speech left a memorable impression on me when I was little. But it's not too scary for little children to view. It always gave me an idea that change is possible for those truly willing to undertake it.

There aren't a lot of songs in this movie compared to more current Disney offerings. I've always thought that the closing notes were so heart-felt because of where and when they were placed. Songs aren't just inserted just for the sake of padding somebody's paycheck.

Its adorable. My favorite story on this DVD though is hands down Small One. Its got cute catchy songs, and it holds the attention of people of all ages. Its a touching story of a boy and his small donkey. The donkey (named Small One) is old, and cannot pull his weight any longer, and the boys father can no longer afford to feed the donkey. So, the boy sadly sets out in search of a kind soul in need of a small donkey. Its an amazing story, it always makes me cry.

2308097,4,B0009OUB06,"This is one of the coolest holiday collections in Disney history. Three stories are included on this dvd.

The first one, I hate so i don't remember the title. But it's a very depressing story about a boy and his donkey.

The second one is a Chip N' Dale CLASSIC that features, Mickey & Pluto. (Pluto's Christmas Tree) I personally am a HUGE fan of the Chip N' Dale cartoons, simply because they are silly without losing their comedic value. I laugh THINKING about it.

The last one is truly the best: Mickey's Christmas Carol. I bought two copies of this movie and sent one to my friend's little boy because I loved it so much.

It's based on the Charles Dickens classic: A Christmas Carol and sticks to the script the whole way through. The cast of characters do an excellent job portraying all the original characters in the book! Mickey as Bob Cratchett, Scrooge McDuck as Ebenezer Scrooge of course, Goofy as the ghost of Jacob Marley, and even Donald Duck shows an excellent performance in the ALMOST miscast role of Scrooge's light-hearted, warm loving NEPHEW! LOL

The ONLY reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because of the depressing ""donkey cartoon"" in the beginning. I promise you it will be a joy for your family for years to come!

The Small One is about a donkey that is past its prime and is taken by its young boy master to Jerusalem to be sold.  After various adventures, the donkey is sold to Joseph who uses it to take Mary to Bethlehem.  This is an older film so expect a little graininess, but the character's are pure Disney in the Don Bluth era.  This was the best of the three to me.

The second cartoon is a Mickey Mouse, Pluto, Chip and Dale short.  Amusing but nothing spectacular.

Last is the Mickey Mouse version of Dicken's Christmas Carol.  Enjoyable more for the plot from Dickens than anything else.  This version is quite short and might be a good introduction to very young children.  I much prefer the Mr. Magoo animated version which takes liberty with the plot and has better music (but inferior animation).

Don Bluth's 1978 animated short,, ""THE SMALL ONE"" makes its long awaited DVD debut in this series...only to be DRASTICALLY EDITED so as to not offend certain people and to minimize the intended religious connotations of this timeless tale.

The color shifts and you can see little white flecks, and general film noise throughout...  but the worst!  The funniest best moments of all were the 3 merchants singing their song...  I have fond memories of my father dancing around my house singing the ""Clink, Clink, Clank Clank Clank"" song...  Disney has changed the lyrics!  The original version went ""We never ever fail when we go to make a sale, weeeeee! Simply cheat a little if we must.""  This DVD, the song has been change to say ""...weeeee! Work a little harder if we must!""

I find it very interesting that Disney didn't see fit to fix the color shifts, and remaster the film, but they apparently found the time to change the funniest part of the whole little film.

That said, at least it is only a minor change... I still have my old copies, recorded from TV so many years ago.  My old copies have gotten worn through the years.  I love that I now have fairly decent copies Mickey's Christmas Carol, and Small One on one DVD.",1134864000,27,1160,4.545893719806763
2308121,5,B0009OUB06,"I wasn't interested in the Mickey Mouse set with MICKEY'S CHRISTMAS CAROL on it when it came out, but I wanted it on DVD as well as THE SMALL ONE, which I only had taped from its showing on the Disney Channel and it was dark and full of static and drop-outs. Last year I got the two different Region 2 DVDs these were on, but was disappointed because on MICKEY'S CHRISTMAS CAROL they cut off the titles with the beautiful Christmas song. So when I saw this set for quite a reasonable price I grabbed it. I do wish it was a bigger Christmas set, with ""The Night Before Christmas"" and ""Santa's Toy Shop"" from the 30s-40s and the Donald Duck/Chip'n'Dale Christmas cartoon, but to have a good, intact copy of Mickey's CAROL and SMALL ONE is good enough for me!",1134604800,6,756,4.330985915492958
2308122,5,B0009OUB06,"This is a great way to get a the Disney shorts for the Holidays, but you may be buying the stories multiple times.  Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol are also on the DVD Snowed in at the House of Mouse.  I prefer House of Mouse even with the extra narration tying in the cartoons because it also has one of the Donald on Ice cartoons.  Small one is nice, but sad and is also on included on another DVD as a special feature.  Disney is releasing their cartoons on multiple DVDs at the same time and it is easy to buy short DVDs like this one and find out later that all the cartoons are already on a larger compilation.  As an earlier review said, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is already on 2 other DVDs.  Still, if you want a particular cartoon and not all of them, this is a good way to go.",1134518400,6,807,4.174193548387096
2308123,5,B0009OUB06,"I would gladly pay the same price for just Mickey's Christmas Carol on the dvd.  But, the other films are also special in their own right.  Good classic Disney stuff here.",1133136000,3,171,4.483870967741935
2308124,4,B0009OUB06,"Just purchased this DVD yesterday mostly for the Pluto's Christmas Tree and Mickey's Christmas Carol. I don't recall ever watching The Small One,though some of it seemed vaguely familiar. It was OK,but not the best. My husband and I have always enjoyed the antics of Chip and Dale,and Mickeys Christmas Carol is one of the best. Our 26 month old granddaughter also liked Chip and Dale and watched only this episode of the DVD twice in a row. I would have liked to see a few more episodes on this DVD such as Toy Tinkers,Corn Chips and the Clock Watcher. Two of those have Chip and Dale featured on them which would have complemented this nicely. But I guess if I want those I'll have to buy Disney's Volume 8.",1132444800,,709,4.461538461538462
2308125,4,B0009OUB06,"Two of these stories, Mickey's Christmas Carol, and Pluto's Christmas Tree were featured in the Mickey In Color tin Volume 2.  The only new one was Small One, which I had in VHS form for many years, and always thought it was a Disney short classic, so I decided to purchase this set.  Unforutnately, the colors on the DVD version are no where near as vivid as my old video copy.  There is tons of artifacting through all 3 shorts, but at least the other 2 are very colorful and vibrant.

It is still a recommended collection, as the two Christmas shorts featured in the Mickey tin had to be accessed through several chapter menus to get them to play.  For a child, it would be hard to pick them out of the tin set if they wanted to watch them, so now it is much easier for them to see all 3 of these Xmas classics in one easy step.  It's too bad the colors are muted on Small One.",1130371200,48,880,4.116959064327485
