If you still have a VHS machine, don't miss this.",1355961600,,115,4.2272727272727275
7854194,3,6303668283,I bought this for a trip to Ireland.  It was helpful but a drag that it wasn't on DVD and only on VHS.,1354492800,,102,3.4347826086956523
7854195,2,6303668283,"This was a disappointing purchase. It's unfortunately more about trains than it is about Ireland and Northern Ireland. Palin isn't funny in it either. There was also a vaguely pro-loyalist lean to the reporting on the troubles. All in all, it was a strange, mildly condescending  (in a ""look at the funny rock bowling games they play"" and ""is that a priest singing?"" way), and rather boring view of Ireland. The best part was the scenery.",1185235200,,438,4.7631578947368425
7854196,5,6303668283,"This is one of my favorite travel video hosted by Michael Palin, the Monty Python guy :). The journey begins at Derry as they travel south to Kerry. I enjoy this so much because it brings back memories from my trip to the area. It was especially a joy to get to see Cork again. It's delightful to see the Irish countryside by train. On my trip I took a couple of train rides and they're a great way to see Ireland. You get to see lots of beautiful scenery. Palin is my favorite travelogist and narrator. He artfully tells history and the culture in his humorous charm. The West of Ireland is the best place to start. The landscapes are so breathe taking. Another reason Palin takes this journey is do some searching his Irish roots. The interviews he has with the locals adds more charm and personable touch to this presentation. Gosh, I want to go back to me second home. This video will have you wanting to go to Ireland, too! Other suggestions to watch 'Full Circle,' and Michael Palin's Travels,  trip to the 'Sahara' which was recently aired on the Bravo Channel. He appears in this weekly series. Tune in!",1049760000,5,1111,4.446078431372549

I really enjoyed listening to Michael Palin as he takes us on a railroad journey from the city of Derry to Kerry.  This journey has a relax feeling to it and you can just sit back and enjoy the trip.  I enjoyed going through the cities and seeing it's culture.  The people that Michael interviews gives you a sense of what life is like in Ireland.  Unfortunatly, Belfast is a city that has it's share of violence and by seeing it on the video you can see the grim reality. On the other hand Dublin is an interesting city to visit.  One of the people that Michael interviews is The Edge from U2.  The other purpose of the trip is that Michael is tracing his family roots by trying to locate his great grandmother.  I hopefully one day will go and see this wonderful country.  Well Done Michael!",973555200,10,889,4.244047619047619
