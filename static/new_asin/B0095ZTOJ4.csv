5272036,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"All 37 eps on 5 disc Prints of the tv shows are very nice.
If you are a fan of the shows. You should get the series.
I hope MGM will bring out season 3 soon",1360022400,15,156,3.361111111111111
5272037,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"I've just received the Bat Masterson first season set and, despite what the initial review said, this is a five-disc set, not single disc, beautifully packaged and an incredible bargain.  The second season is on the way, and I hope the third will follow.",1359936000,30,254,4.7727272727272725
5272038,1,B0095ZTOJ4,"This set is advertised as The First Season of Bat Masterson and contains ONE disc. From what I understand, Season One has 37 episodes. I'm no production expert but you can be sure that 37 episodes stretched onto one disc will be HORRIBLE video quality. I imagine the producers of this set were trying to keep their costs low but if I'm going to spend 13 bucks for a disc, I'd like the quality to at least be watchable.
This hasn't been released yet but I have to admit so far I don't have high hopes.
They don't even list the name of the episodes included.",1359072000,3,556,4.254716981132075
5272039,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Excellent,1415836800,,9,9.0
5272040,4,B0095ZTOJ4,Entertaining. I ordered seasons 2 & 3 but haven't watched them yet. I had never heard of the series before my purchase.,1413676800,,119,4.454545454545454
5272041,3,B0095ZTOJ4,Wery good,1411430400,,9,4.0
5272042,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Excellent

Also, Hawaii 5-0 was excellent - I marked it wrong.",1409961600,,62,4.636363636363637
5272043,3,B0095ZTOJ4,"You see everything changed to color but all these old classics seem to lack that.  The cover is in color
and the ad's in color but not the shows themselves.  I don't care for any of those who won't tell you truth
as to color or not.  I liked the shows but not the people who never inhanced to color.",1399766400,,299,3.95
5272044,5,B0095ZTOJ4,It was great to see this DVD available at an affordable price.  I was enthralled by this western when it originally aired.  This is an excellent rendition - very good quality of picture and sound.,1399161600,,196,4.571428571428571
5272045,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Great fun to watch and are fine for most all ages. We watch them in our travel trailer. We like to watch them at home as well.,1393977600,,126,3.7037037037037037
5272046,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Love Gene Berry in Burkes Law so wanted to see the thing that made him famous. Like classic westerns? The men were men and they showed it? This is it. The history is probably very loose, but who cares? It is just a great way to enjoy a rainy afternoon.  It is black and white and from the early days of television so the quality of ""today"" isn't there. But it is well done.",1389744000,,373,4.04054054054054
5272047,4,B0095ZTOJ4,The CD  although not many episodes (8) was interesting and entertaining. I'd recommend it solely for the price. Thank you.,1389139200,,122,5.1
5272048,5,B0095ZTOJ4,I have always like the show Bat Masterson. It has all the qualities of a good TV show.  Gene Barry is super in it.,1383696000,,114,3.75
5272049,4,B0095ZTOJ4,"I watched one episode on the western channel a few years back.  I wasn't impressed.  Plus, I was not a Gene Barry fan.  But fast forward.  I finally retired after 45 years in my craft.  I'm a western fan and old broken down stunt man (to boot), and don't sleep too well.  I saw the boxed set and the price was right, so bought it. I figured if I didn't like it, I'd give it to one of my old stuntmen buddies.  As I got into it, it won me over.  (Remember thought, this series was in B/W.)  The stories were somewhat accurate to the real Masterson - as good as '60s TV gets.  The acting seemed better than the shows i had remembered from the past and the episodes zipped along. I wasn't to happy with the period guns used, but I know TV doesn't do firearms too well. It was worth the money and I was pleased.  I did not fall asleep, which might have been my secret goal. I'll buy future sets as they come out - I don't recall how many years the series ran.  Happy Trails.",1382572800,11,970,4.020942408376963
5272050,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"This is really nice Saturday morning, shows.  I enjoyed them when they were on originally and I enjoy them now.  Get a cup of coffee, sit down, relax and enjoy.",1382313600,,160,4.3
5272051,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Watched these shows when I was a kid and loved them. Sent this to a relative who is temporarily homebound and he loves them.,1381276800,3,124,4.208333333333333
5272052,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Gene Barry makes this show very entertaining.  Strong story lines make these shows very pleasant to watch.  I highly recommend them!,1380844800,3,132,5.238095238095238
5272053,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Black and white episodes.  Many stars of the 60's.  And not too much violence.  A true family show. YV like it once was.,1379548800,2,120,4.130434782608695
5272054,5,B0095ZTOJ4,The best cd of the master of the cane and hat.  The episodes are an insight as to how Bat started and his career.,1379548800,,113,3.7083333333333335
5272055,5,B0095ZTOJ4,No one is as smooth and smart as Gene Barry's character! What a great memory I had of Bat Masterson and I was correct!,1379203200,2,118,3.9583333333333335
5272056,5,B0095ZTOJ4,One of my many  favorite western series. The dvd set was packed well and arrived when expected. I will probably buy more of the series,1378771200,2,134,4.36
5272057,4,B0095ZTOJ4,"With Gene Barry you rarely go wrong!
This is adult B western TV style, but confident, with humor and some above average scripts.
Have not watched every episode as yet but  expectancy is always welcome.
One of the best buys for me..",1376006400,2,231,4.5
5272058,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Having watched this show as a kid , I forgot how swiftly Bat answered any slight or insult immediately! To question the honor of any woman [who Bat managed to conquer in EVERY town or campsite], was to get an instant lesson in manners! Gene Barry nails this character who dresses like a dandy, BUT DOES'NT TAKE CRAP FROM ANYBODY!!!! Great fun at a great price!",1374278400,3,360,4.46969696969697
5272059,5,B0095ZTOJ4,The sound and picture quality were top notch! A must have for any Bat Masterson fan! My 20 year old daughters love watching it with me.,1372377600,,135,4.230769230769231
5272060,4,B0095ZTOJ4,"This was a fairly good series, well acted and produced.  You have to be a fan of Gene Barry to like this one.  I met him many years ago at the Calgary Stampede in Calgary Alberta Canada where he was the special guest.  He promoted his series quite well.  I am not to sure how historical each episode was.  They made reference to the year each story represented.  This series was quite entertaining.",1371772800,,398,4.383561643835616
5272061,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"I really enjoy this television series.  Gene Barry is great as a tough, but dandified, Western hero with a good sense of humor and a strong sense of justice.  The many notable guest stars are fun to see and the stories are solid and quite entertaining.  The picture and sound quality are also worthy, especially considering this is television from half-a-century ago!  Bat Masterson is a fine series for adults and children, and at $12 a season, it's a steal.",1369699200,4,459,4.7
5272062,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Gene Barry made Bat Masterson come alive and the series seem realistic although far from it, it was good entertainment with the TV people creating a wholesome strong, likeable good guy with just a twist of larcney yet a class act.  Gene Barry did the part well and after this ended he moved on to several other series not lasting that long but all just as well directed for fun and enjoyment",1368576000,,391,4.430555555555555
5272063,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Boxed nicely in cardboard and DVD cases. Good quality.
This was a great series. I hope they offer more seasons.",1368230400,,111,4.6
5272064,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Great to see this show again and anytime I want now. I remember the basic premise from when it was first on and still enjoy it.,1365379200,,127,3.923076923076923
5272065,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Really like those old westerns.  Have always liked Gene Barry.  Have not viewed the series yet but am looking forward to seeing him in a western vs the other more modern things he appeared / starred in.....,1364515200,,206,4.54054054054054
5272066,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Great western series with Gene Barry as Bat Masterson. Saw some episodes on encore westerns a few years back but glad they are on dvd!,1364515200,,134,4.4
5272067,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"I bought both box sets. Let me tell you its worth the investment. Quality is EXCELLENT. I can't wait to buy the rest. What more can I say if your a fan of the show you'll be in western heaven. It's a shock seeing such a low price...but HEY...I wish they would do more like that.

PS: Wait till you see SEA HUNT...I bought all 4 sets and again GREEEEAAAATTTTT QUALITY.",1364256000,2,367,4.169014084507042
5272068,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Packaging could be better but for the price I can replace the cases, otherwise  for the price an excellent purchase.",1363564800,,116,4.8
5272069,5,B0095ZTOJ4,this is a superb box set sound and picture excellent.only minor gripe no extras but for the price and quality i gave it 5 stars,1363392000,,127,4.12
5272070,4,B0095ZTOJ4,"The only reason that I have given this set 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the packaging,
there are 2 DVD plasic cases within a cardboard box and one of those cases has 3 DVD piggybacking on a central hub, the other case is okay with 2 DVD on individual holders.
I fixed this problem by the use of a plastic container of my own with 3 separate holders, this fixed a problem that should not been allowed to start with as I take pride with my extensive collection and could not accept this ""stacks on the mill"" technique to hold discs, especially with a series such as ""Sea Hunt"" of which I have very fond memories then living along the Indean Ocean coast, it is good to see that season 2 of Bat Masterson does not have that problem.
I needed to dispose of my ""Becker"" series to use those containers, I am used to doing that over the years with other purchases and I will no doubt have to repeat this with ""Sea Hunt"" and ""Highway Patrol"", I am still using the cardboard boxes with removable lid to hold these containers, these are useful in both having good cover pictures and having overall episode lists on the back.
In the earlier release of Bat Masterson  Collectors Edition by Ziv Television Productions United Artists are these words:

""Works presented on this DVD are in public domain
 content researched finding all copyrights expired or lapsed thru time on non-renewal

{At least the MGM logo is still present on the packaging.}

Do not bother searching for any extras on this new release for there are none
or any real information at all, they are products looking and sounding great
but lacking any love for the product, but then I suppose these days that is nothing new.
I am though very grateful to own these as they are so much better than the release
of a few years ago of ""Sea Hunt"" in 2006 and ""Bat Masterson"" at about the same time.",1363305600,4,1955,4.474719101123595
5272071,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"This is a nice quality product.  It is well produced and professionally packaged.  The Bat Masterson TV series was filmed in black and white, so that is the way this set is issued.  The video is clean and crisp and the sound is good.  There are a few places where some scan lines are visible, but it is not bad.  I recommend it and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bat-Masterson-Complete-Season-Two/dp/B009OE2NZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bat Masterson Complete Season Two</a>&nbsp;to anyone who in interested in this classic TV show.  These sets have the MGM logo on the back of the DVD cases, so it seems they are authorized by MGM, who distributed the TV series.  I hope that they will soon release season three.

After seeing a few episodes on hulu.com, I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BAT-MASTERSON-11-DVD-BOXED-SET-108-EPISODES-IN-CHRONOLOGICAL-ORDER-COMPLETE-SERIES-RICH-BLACK-AND-WHITE/dp/B004QVMHZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BAT MASTERSON-11 DVD BOXED SET-108 EPISODES IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER-COMPLETE SERIES-RICH BLACK AND WHITE</a>&nbsp;.  In that set, the resolution of the images was poor and the audio was not properly synchronized with the video, making it annoying to watch.  I returned it and ordered these.

I am pleased with the quality of these sets.",1362182400,15,1365,6.569832402234637
5272072,5,B0095ZTOJ4,Love the 50s 60s tv westerns and this one did not disappoint. Looking forward to Series 2 and happily I won't have long to wait.,1362096000,,128,4.16
5272073,3,B0095ZTOJ4,"How can a collection that contains only the first twelve episodes be considered a ""Best of"" collection. Season One, Part One would have been more appropriate. Go for the extra few bucks and get ""The Complete Season One"". Even the ""Marathon Set"" is a better value. Don't for get to pick up Season Two while you're at it.",1361750400,3,319,4.517241379310345
5272074,4,B0095ZTOJ4,Good old time western with a good plot. Good sharpness. Good acting. A 1/2 hour show. It met my expectations. I am glad I purchased.,1361664000,3,132,4.32

5272078,5,B0095ZTOJ4,"Have watched the first 2 disks and the quality is excellent.  Free of dirt and dust!  Sharp and crisp!  Thus far the run times have been just over 26 minutes, which means they are the complete episodes.  TGG did an excellent job!!  No captions, and a ""Play all"" or by individual episodes are the only features.  But for the price of $11.99 for a newly release by seasons packages, can't beat it!!!

Update...finished the entire Season 1 (5 disks), all episodes run 25:50 or longer.  So again, complete episodes.",1360368000,27,511,4.662921348314606
