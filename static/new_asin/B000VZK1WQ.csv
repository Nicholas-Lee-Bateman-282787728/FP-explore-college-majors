8220728,5,B000VZK1WQ,"Im suprised to see that now season 3 is being offered in two sets, like the newer versions (seasons 4 5 6). I own Season 1,2,3 in the original format. I would suggest looking for the original dvd versions instead of the new format.
I like the series, I like how fast Amazon ships and their pricing and policies.",1210982400,2,311,4.288135593220339
8220729,2,B000VZK1WQ,"Season 3 Parts 1 and 2 are good shows, but the quality on these DVDs is poor.  No disc menu exists.  There are no extra features.  Basically, someone dumped all the shows on a dvd and called it good.  You can't take the DVD out of your player or you will have to start from the beginning and ""forward"" through all the shows to get where you left off or to find your favorite episode.  My family loves this show, but the disc quality for Season 3 is not worth $30 for each part.  This was very disappointing.",1205452800,5,507,4.122448979591836
