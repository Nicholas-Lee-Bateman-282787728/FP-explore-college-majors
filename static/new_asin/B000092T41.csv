7988798,4,B000092T41,"Even if you're not a fan of Roller Derby, this is an hour of thrills and spills on skates. For those who think that the sport is scripted, you'll see some falls (including a skater who flies over the rail going head first into the fourth row of the audience) that no sane person would willingly undertake. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the video is the lives of the skaters. They range from a San Fernando Valley mother of two to a beauty queen and an aging former superstar who is still active at 50. By the way, if you've never skated on a banked track, you'll discover it turns your legs to spaghetti. It's also worth mentioning that falling on your rear when moving at 35 mph is no piece of cake, even if you're wearing padding.

Watch this and have a good time because that's why it was made.",1240099200,9,806,4.302631578947368
