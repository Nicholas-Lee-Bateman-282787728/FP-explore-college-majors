4109854,5,B003CP62EI,"First, let me just say this was one of the best series I've ever seen.
  The story is great, the characters are awesome, and overall, it's just amazing.  If you understand this, this anime is textbook shounen.  Meaning, there's plenty of violence, lots of pretty girls, some swearing, and comedy at the strangest of times.
  But ignoring all of that for a moment, the story is amazing.  Without giving too much away, Masane Amaha suddenly has a weapon that can totally destroy just about anything, and she has to live with that while trying to raise a 6 year old daughter.
  So, yeah, great story.  And back on the shounen stuff: guys, I wish I had thought of it sooner, but something fun you might try is that when all the women start fighting each other, pretend they're fighting over you!",1316304000,,791,4.546099290780142
4109855,5,B003CP62EI,"The show was not too short, but also not so long that it felt like it was dragged on for all it was worth. There was a good balance of action and story too! The action scenes and the monsters were awesome, and yet there were still plenty of tender and funny moments to go around. This was the first anime to ever actually make me cry! I'm not going to spoil any of the plot, so I'm just going to say that this collection is a good buy for ANYONE who is looking for something amazing to watch out of an anime. BUY IT!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Witchblade-Box-Set-Viridian-Collection/dp/B003CP62EI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Witchblade Box Set (Viridian Collection)</a>",1313625600,3,716,5.401785714285714
4109856,5,B003CP62EI,"So I kind of consider myself a connoisseur when I comes to anime, being I've spent a good chunk of money on DVD's since I was in middle school. This Series was in my option what anime is really about, story.

The interaction between the characters is very compelling and the plot did not fall short (such as with Claymore with the single revenge driven character, still a good show though). What really won me over was the relationships that developed between the characters. Each character helped move the story along even if they were only in the show shortly.

*Warning- skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the show yet* I feel Possibly the best part about the sure is the relationship between Masane and Rihoko. The interaction was the perfect blend of comedy and drama. I personally cried when they were separated (I know, in touch with my sensitive side ^_^), however even with all the plot twist and the sometimes generic story this still was a series I felt was one of the best I had watch in a long time and loved everyone minute of it.

For anyone who is a fan of shows like Samurai Champloo and Full Metal Panic! this is a show you'll definitely want to get your hands on.",1312588800,2,1187,4.460829493087558

8394375,5,B003CP62EI,"If you want a show with just the right amounts of action and comedy with good character development then this may be what you are looking for. Dont let the cover fool you, this is not a mindless T&A show. Its mostly a story about what a woman will go through to protect her daughter and the true meaning of family. Highly recommended.",1330992000,4,334,4.317460317460317
