8213239,5,B000UGTKKK,"I want to catch a tarpon on a flyrod and sight cast to the fish. I enjoyed this DVD. I had previously purchased and watched Chasing Silver by same production company, Jamie Howard. Both very well done in my opinion. Location X is not a secret anymore but shows you another method to fly fish for Tarpon. So if you are into Tarpon fishing with flyrod, I recommend this DVD

8213240,5,B000UGTKKK,"This is an unusually good fishing video because of the fine camera work. Action packed scenes of big tarpon on a fly rod are enhanced by the beautiful salt water setting in crystal clear bays. While there is some narration, the viewer is not distracted by talking heads voicing inane advice, or excessive small talk. Lessons are extracted from the viewing the main piece, or from watching the added features.",1242777600,,408,4.8428571428571425
