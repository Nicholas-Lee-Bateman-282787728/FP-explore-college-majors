4556537,4,B00543R3WG,This is a great package for those of us who are not interested in all the extra features that you have to pay alot more money for and not even watch the price is good for just the movies.  If you want the extras then just wait and pay alot more it'll be out,1316649600,46,257,3.759259259259259
4556538,1,B00543R3WG,"Sigh, just like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I too shall wait patiently for the ultimate Blu-Ray release of the entire movie set. sigh.. such a shame WB is going this route.",1316563200,20,175,4.333333333333333
4556539,4,B00543R3WG,"I like how a lot of fans are slamming Warner Brothers for offering up a box set containing all eight films in one compact package. They accuse how WB constantly does this for the Harry Potter franchise, and to be fair, WB has been doing incomplete Potter boxed releases for years, starting with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" onwards. But when the WB actually makes a nice package with all eight films included, they still complain because there's hardly any bonus material. WB did this for their first four Batman movies before the glorious Batman Anthology came to be, so those fans have been waiting a long time that as well.

The set will just have a repressing of the initial releases, and the first three movies include their respective trailers, while ""Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2"" have deleted/extended scenes, so the ""no extras"" claim doesn't hold as much water. They have some, as opposed to none. Not to mention the quality of the past three Ultimate Editions' bonus features have declined to the point where I just stopped buying them (bulky packaging, no commentary and no extended editions are the deal-breakers). For me, I just want the movies, and this set allows that. For that alone it gets 4 stars. It's a no-frills package but worth it if you just want the movies and save shelf space.

If you want a comprehensive box set with tons of extras for each movie, you'll have to wait. Don't buy it if you don't want to.",1316563200,"1,346",1425,4.628458498023716
4556540,1,B00543R3WG,"I totally agree with the current opinion thread!!! If WB wanted to do this right, they would release the set in 3D !!",1316563200,5,117,4.130434782608695
4556541,1,B00543R3WG,"I had the feeling they were going to do this when they kept with the box sets 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7.  Come on really all but 1 movie.  So not a surprise that they would give a bare bone 1-8 to start.  I avoided dipping into the Blu Ray Harry Potters knowing I would end up double dipping for the Ultimate collection of all 8 films.  I guess next Christmas we will see the 1-8 with all the deleted scenes and with any luck extended viewing instead of just seperate features.  So Warner please stop wasting our time, just get with the picture and give us the real complete set.",1316563200,15,571,4.154545454545454
4556542,1,B00543R3WG,"This appears to be a repackaging of existing versions, aka money grab.  Look at the back packaging audio specs.  They are a mess.  DTS-MA for 7 1/2, True HD for 6, PCM for 1-5.  Will wait for a proper collectors box set.  I don't expect to see anything proper that coincides with this release.

4556543,5,B00543R3WG,"First of all, I'm aware of the lack of many Special Features on this set. But for this, it doesn't concern me since it is going to be a Christmas present for my Mom who doesn't even watch any of the Special Features that regularly come with movies. People are going to give this set Two to One Star merely for the sake that it lakes Special Features but if you're like my Mom and don't really watch them, then go for this! Really I mean, what's the harm? I mean isn't this set the one everyone's more-or-less been waiting for? Isn't this why we've avoided the ""Years 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7: Part 1 Gift Sets?"" It really is simple guys, you just need to read the fine print. If you want the whole set with minimal Special Features, then go for this. If you DO like Special Features, then just, I don't know, buy the Ultimate Editions individually or something. Me personally, I'd prefer a lot of Special Features but this is a gift for my Mom so it doesn't matter. Know what you're buying folks.",1316563200,9,989,4.294117647058823

Its a great price, has all of the movies in good quality, includes several special features and saves you the trouble of navigating numerous bluray cases to find the movies(It's all stored in one box).
The video quality is very good considering the age of the films and they have been transferred to bluray very successfully. The audio quality was very high quality as well. I have watched these with studio headphones as well as on nice HiFi speakers and everything is crisp. If I did have any complaints it would be the lackluster menu on most of the movies. Thats only a minor gripe though because they still come with special features and the movies are all intact with great quality.

The rest of the movies were filmed in 2K so I imagine they had some kind of upscaling applied to them.  Also the discs support HDR but the digital downloads support Dolby Vision.,1524700800,,308,4.275862068965517

It was very obviously used and has wear and scratch marks on the bottom. I contacted Amazon who did give me voucher to buy another new one of just disc 7. I thought that was fair. Now I have started watching the movies and they are all starting in odd places of the movies, which tells me that they were also used.

The new characters are engaging, and the creatures are the creations of someone with a knowledge of zoology...and a LOT of imagination. I'm really excited to learn that the next film in what's advertised to be a five film series, will be released in November. Jacob, Queenie, Newt and the rest will be back in the sequel.

I'm not a huge fan of the original Harry Potter movies, though I am a HUGE FAN of the books. I thought it was just because I'm not really a ""see all the movies"" kind of person.
Then I saw this. A few days later, it became the only movie I've ever seen twice in the theater. My husband, not a Potterhead at all, is anxiously awaiting the next in this series. We even named our dog after one of the characters.
I think it's because this is the mind of JKR, directly made into a movie script, rather than an adaptation from a book. I'm just one of those book people. Either way, it's a fantastic film all on its own.",1522713600,,684,4.111940298507463

4556876,5,B00543R3WG,"Finally! A collector's edition for adults. If you are over 18 years old and want a box set of the Harry Potter movie saga... this is the one to get. The discs themselves are the standard blu-rays you get from previous releases. The difference is the box set itself. I collect blu-rays so presentation is important. On this one the disc is thick and strong and has great artwork. The discs themselves are held in a photo album type of booklet that is itself  made of nice quality.

The only downside is that I am not a big fan of the cardboard style holders that you insert the discs in. They tend to scratch the disc if you are not careful. Still, I think the pluses outweigh the minus here and it still rates as the best of the Harry Potter Box Sets.",1522713600,,751,4.244755244755245

Yes, it was the bad guy doing this, but those hints failed to make it as wholly unappealing and dirty - paving yet another street by which main-stream media tries to normalize sick, degrading and abusive actions.  The abuse was implicit in several interactions with highly sensual overtones, but nothing else about the film questioned or made it clear that this was wrong - and the minor in question also seemed to never have a problem with it.  Everybody, including the audience, was apparently supposed to ignore the implications and thus we are all made complicit in grooming / sexual abuse of minors.

With 16 discs the failure rate is bound to be a bit high, but with the 4k discs we had 2 out of the 8 that won't load.  Visual inspection shows no obvious defects on the media.  These issues could have been easily caught by QA.

We did not test the Blu-ray discs.

Lastly the plastic box that the discs came was damaged during shipping, this was not major but when you are spending this amount of money on a product it would be nice if they packaged them in boxes that were not so brittle.

Upon inserting the disc I receive a ""Disc may be scratched or not finalized"" error. But after ejecting and reinserting a few times they seem to work EXCEPT for The Half Blood Prince, which goes to a black screen and freezes up my player. I would have to unplug the power and reset the player, but the  movie never plays. I've passed the return deadline and now I'm stuck with a disc that doesn't play. I've emailed Warner Bros a week ago about this issue and have yet to receive a response.
On top of everything, none of the bonus discs are included with this set. You only get an identical set of 1080p BluRay discs of the movies. Extremely disappointing.",1519171200,2,786,4.383561643835616

I just sent them a picture of the box set with the code and a copy of my receipt.  I want to give it 5 stars.  The package looks fantastic.  The discs are in cardboard sleeves I know these will get tore up eventually but they look amazing.  As I said before it all works on my player so I am guessing they are region free.

The set supports about any format you'd want to use.

I put in a request for a replacement, and it arrived within a few days. I checked the DVDs for quality and once again the same DVD was corrupted. I called Amazon's customer service and was told that there is no way of ensuring the quality of the product.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched it, to be honest. I'm a huge fan of the HP films so when this came out, I kinda brushed it off. BOY was I wrong for that. The characters are SO well written and the actors that portray them are perfect. But why am I crying? I'm not sure. Maybe it's because everyone else is? Because I relate so much to each of these characters? How do you do that? How do you capture one person's emotions and spread them out among several characters? JK Rowling, would love to know how. But I seriously cry each time I watch it.

I love the 20s NYC setting and the clothes are perfect. If I could be Queenie and Seraphina at the same time, I'd do it. But all of the women are SO smart and powerful, which I love. I am really looking forward to the next installment this year. I bought the screenplay as well to study it as I'm hoping to delve into screenwriting on the side.",1517443200,,926,4.082417582417582

Even though the Ultraviolet code has an expiration date of 3/4/16, after selecting a few different versions of Harry Potter Complete Collection on VUDU the code worked! Still not sure why the sticker on the packing has an expiration date of 12/31/18 and the box and redemption card have a date of 3/4/16, but the code works so all is good.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: This Harry Potter set looks like it has it all! The packaging is beautiful and it comes with tons of additional content for the avid Potter fan. However, my first order of this item came damaged and both of the items I received came with expired Ultraviolet codes which makes a third of what this set offers useless.",1516406400,3,711,4.606299212598425

The special features are great (some information does repeat in multiple discs, but that doesn't bother me).  The big bound album for the DVDs is cool, it's a real collector's item. Looks great on the shelf.

My only issue is the UltraViolet digital download.  What a disaster.  The first code I got was expired, so amazon had me return the entire thing, sent me a new one.  It had an acceptable code, and when I finally was able to redeem it .... it redeemed Deathly Hallows Part 1 and nothing else.  The website provided with the UV code no longer exists so it prompts you to visit a different website. I went through all that nonsense, and it still isn't right.  I called FANDANGO a month ago with the issue and still have no had it resolved.

4557388,4,B00543R3WG,"I am a major fan of the Harry Potter Movies (I grew up with them), they were on every holiday on one of our local channels, extremely cheap TV but we still got to watch all of them (or all there were at the time, not all of them were out).

The movies themselves are great, they were well done, and you can see the progression of the actors, characters, and story with each one. And I would rate the collection itself, in regards to the movies, as masterful. I enjoyed every single one, and do not regret this purchase in the slightest.

However, there is a caveat here, Movie 6 (Halfblood Prince) has an ad in it (rather than simply starting like the first 5 did), it has an ad for a Wizard of Oz collectors edition or something. Very random, totally not needed, would rather it NOT have that. Not sure if it is specific to this collection, the DVD itself (that they were all made this way; Bluray technically), or what was going on, but a random ad is annoying.

Each movie has a corresponding extra-features blu-ray with commentary, interviews, trailers and some deleted scenes. I do not think the first and maybe the second movie was filmed in full 1080 High-def as the resolution seems to be about 720p which is half way between the 600 resolution of DVD and the 1080 of blu-ray.

4557477,3,B00543R3WG,"I'm making it a point to use the title of the film as a headline because an awful lot of the posted reviews seem to be about an 8 disc Harry Potter collection...

Perhaps, like me, you're in withdrawl from the magical world of Harry Potter.  You've read all the books multiple times, watched the movies so much that you say the lines with the characters, and have every tie in imaginable.  You know your Hogwarts House, you await your letter each fall with eagerness - and disappointment when it doesn't arrive.  You're all about the rights of house elves but sorely disappointed that none arrive to help with the housekeeping.  You've considered shipping various characters together in a variety of mixes, but wait!  A new Harry Potter movie, based off the book that you got when it was first issued?  So in!  I picked up the book copy of the script to be ready when it was released, and... Well, I hoped it would translate better to the screen, sad to say.

Visually, this movie is lovely, and probably would have been even better on the big screen rather than my computer monitor.  The creatures and the world they inhabit are marvelously done, complete with music swelling at the appropriate times.  The actors do their job well, convincing enough at their characters that you stop calling Eddie Redmayne ""the guy who played Stephen Hawking"" by a few minutes in.  Explosions, check.  Magic shields, check.  Magic terminology - new, American magic terminology! - check.  Allusions to Harry Potter's world - check, with a cheer each time.

And yet... This is a movie based on a textbook based on a book.  Even spinning parts of the rest of the series in, that's not a lot to base a feature length film off of, which regretfully shows in the film.  Even understanding that this is establishing a base to jumpstart a new movie series, it felt weak, a visual spectacle lacking subtance.  Will I see the next one?  Well, yes, see the Harry Potter fan freak out a couple paragraphs above.  I hope it's overall better than this, though.",1514592000,4,2032,4.635854341736695

I'm not going to review the movies.  This review is just for the collection itself, and what's included.  More importantly, what's not included.  If you are buying this 4K collection only for the movies, you will not be disappointed.  This is the best way to see and hear the movies.  They look amazing and sound even better.  However, I was surprised when I opened the box and saw only 16 discs, 8 for the 4K editions and 8 for the Blu Ray editions.  If you were to buy the 4K movies individually, you get an additional 3rd disc which is where all the extras are.  That 3 disc is not included for any of the movies in this collection.  There are no extras included with this collection, except for one each on the Blu Ray edition; the in-movie experience.  I previously owned the Blu Ray Ultimate editions, and I was really disappointed that the documentaries found on there are no where to be found in this collection.  No additional scenes.  Nothing.  In addition, the previous Extended versions of The Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets are only available on the Blu Ray discs.  The 4K disc only contains the Theatrical version.

This review is for the ""Harry Potter 8-film Collection (4kUHD) [Blu-ray]"" box set.  I have all the original films on Blu-ray, and recently purchased a LG OLED 4K HDTV and an Oppo UDP-205 to play 4K movies on, so I was excited to see that Warner Brother's released the iconic Harry Potter series on 4K in a box set, and that Amazon had a special price of $129.88 for this two weeks ago.

The problems started after the order was placed on the 14th.  I am a Prime member and selected the one-day shipping method, but the set didn't arrive till Monday the 18th.  Secondly, when I opened the plastic box the plastic hinges that are supposed to hold the disc in the box fell out onto the floor.  One of the tabs for the box was broken and one of the spindle rods was also broken.

Still I was  undeterred and put in the first 4K disc, Sorcerer's Stone.  About 1 hour 46 minutes into the movie the disc just froze and I couldn't go back or skip forward.  In fact I had a heck of a time turning off my player and removing the disc!  I called Amazon to complain and they agreed to refund me my money.

Just for curiosity sake I tried playing the next three discs.  The second one, Chamber of Secrets, played all the way through, but around 1 hr 46 minutes it skipped a bit, but played all the way through.

The third disc, Prisoner of Azkaban, had the same skipping problems as the first, but when it froze, at least I was able to open the Oppo with the tray open function and remove the disc.  I was not able to watch the whole movie, like I wasn't with Sorcerer's Stone.

The four disc, Goblet of Fire, experienced the most problems.  It skipped and froze many times, making the disc unplayable too!

The long story short is the 4K versions of these movies appear to be defective from the factory and should be addressed by Warner Brothers!!!  Or perhaps I got a bad batch?!  I would like to know if anyone else bought this 4K set and experienced any problems with the 4K disc playback?

I must say, at least in terms of the quality of the 4K transfer, the Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire had really great video quality other than the aforementioned problems!  The first two movies video wasn't as good as Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire.

I never tried playing the Blu-rays.",1514332800,9,2493,4.66743119266055

4557572,2,B00543R3WG,"Delayed audio and inconsistent packaging! Wanted to enjoy the Harry Potter movies, but the product itself seems subpar in comparison to other DVD collection products (e.g. LOTR). The DVD collection seems to be a Frankenstein of other individually packaged movies (i.e. The disc for The Half-Blood Prince says Disc 1 Movie as if it comes from a 2-DVD set). Most importantly, the audio in the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was severely delayed for a good 20-30 minutes of the movie. I have not seen Part 2 yet, so I cant vouch for that movie, but movies 1-6 were fine. Lastly, as someone who needs/enjoys subtitles, HP 1-6 do NOT have a DVD menu screen, so you don't have an option to turn them on. Overall, I enjoy and love Harry Potter, but this disc set was much less than what I had hoped for.",1513728000,14,788,4.479166666666667

While I would have preferred to have all the extra content of the hogwarts collection in the 4kUHD set, I can say that the 4k edition of the movies look absolutely phenominal on a 4k HDR television!  I would have preferred some more details in the description of what you get in each package, and I hope that amazon does a better job seperating reviews from product to product as some of the reviews DO NOT apply to the 4kUHD set.",1513641600,70,4426,5.002721088435374

4557588,1,B00543R3WG,"BEWARE This is a scam, I bought ""Harry Potter: Complete 8-Film Collection GIFTSET DVD + Blu-ray"" The first thing:  It doesn't come with DVD's. Why is still listed that way? I don't get it.  I returned it and the second time came again without the DVD's so NOT GIFT SET AT ALL.
The second thing: The Blu Rays are cheaply made and the volume is barely audible. My TV volume was in 70 and still was hard to hear.
The third thing: Every movie is on one disk and in this set and the one I received has a  movie which said: ""DISK 1 MOVIE"" so this disk doesn't belong to this set. Still worst: I returned it and received back a set with the same disk what made me think: all the sets are altered or they sent me exactly the same set I sent back. Jeez...
I have been back and forth with Amazon CS trying to get another set that what I bought and today I chat with:
The worst: The Amazon's Customer Service representative Stephen V. who told me that what I can do is to buy the: ""Harry Potter: Hogwarts Collection Collector's Edition
 He said: ""The Multi Format Disc is different to Blu Ray, this dis contains 31 Discs, and a different manufacturer. It has 31 Discs."" Yes, is more expensive and ""I know this is frustrating, but this is the only option we have.
I do apologize for the inconvenience.""
WTH??? I have to pay $100 more because Amazon can't guarantee an item which is their AMAZON CHOICE??? It's really that difficult to follow up with a complaint like this which it's not the only one with the same problems: NO DVD, Cheapy Blu Rays and Volume trouble????.

None of the films seemed to be from the same collection - some were blank, some had pictures on it, etc. I haven't tried all of the DVDs yet to see if they work, but the first one (Sorcerer's Stone) was so badly scratched it made a terrible noise in my DVD player and was immediately ejected, unable to play. Maybe I'm missing something, but this didn't say it was used from what I could tell. Since there was no slip, I don't think this can be returned - waste of money.",1512864000,2,772,4.294520547945205

The Dursleys weren't quite as funny. Snape was nowhere near as despicable onscreen as in the novels; Rickman was the right man for the role, though, with phrasing and facial expressions I doubt anyone else could match.

The rest of the actors were good picks for the most part. I recognized a couple of familiar faces from Game of Thrones and one from Starship Discovery. True to the British tradition of having people look realistic, teeth were crooked and yellow, hair was messy when warranted, and clothes wrinkled.

If you own the whole set on blu-ray, I don't think you need to buy it on 4K as well. However, if you're like me, who didn't own the full set, it might be worth it to invest in the 4k set.
Tip: the 4k set comes with the full blu-ray (not 4k) set. I was able to split the cost with a friend and send her the blu-ray set, while I kept the 4k. They are packaged in separate cases as well, which made it convenient.",1512518400,20,555,3.920353982300885

I just wanted to post a comprehensive set of pictures to let people who are considering this set exactly what they're getting.

PRESENTATION:  The slipcase is heavy cardboard, very sturdy.
The discs are bound in a wide-format book, one year/movie per page, three to four discs per year/movie.
  The  SLIPCASE IS NEARLY A FOOT WIDE and will NOT fit on a shelf like a standard dvd/blu-ray.

DISCS:  DVD, BluRay, and Ultraviolet (or movies anywhere or vudu or whatever) digital code for ALL 2d movies
  Discs with extra features, varies by ""year.""
  3D blu-rays for ONLY THE LAST TWO MOVIES, deathly hallows 1&2 (3D digital code NOT part of the set)

VALUE:  Well, if you're a fan then this is a very nice set, and the sky's the limit with ""value,"" right? :)
I purchased during a Black Friday sale from Amazon for nearly half-off, and at that price was worth it.  Full price, well, there are fans for that but not me.",1512432000,2,1067,4.5661375661375665

4557692,5,B00543R3WG,"This is a review for Harry Potter: The Complete 16 Disc Blu-Ray Set.

I at first bought the 8 disc set thinking it had all of the bonus features upon reading reviews not realizing Amazon has combined all the reviews for all of the HP disc sets. I returned that and bought the 16 disc set only to learn there was The Hogwargs Collection (the 31 disc set). I was super bummed seeing that it was ~$150. I decided to check into the special features to see if it was the same (without the DVDs - just Blu-Ray discs). It doesnt tell you in the description so its hard to tell but to me it looks like this 16 disc collection is the same as the 31 disc collections simply without the DVDs EXCEPT for the following:

 There is a bonus disc in the 31 disc collection. It has according to another users review the following...

When Harry Left Hogwarts - Extended Version (the 16 Disc Collection has this but possibly not the extended version)
50 Greatests HP Moments (not seeing this on the 16 Disc Collection)
Designing the World of HP (Not seeing this on the 16 Disc Collection BUT it does have Warner Bros Studio Tour London - The Making of HP)
& More! Not sure what the & More according to the other reviewer BUT there are MANY more special features on this last DVD of the 16 Disc Collection that aren't mentioned above such as Harrys Last Stand (Ext. Version), The Women of HP, The Goblins is Gringotts, The Great Hall of Hogwarts, Deleted Scenes and more.

So again, it looks like this collection is very similar to the 31 disc collection minus the DVDs (since, again, its just the blue ray DVDs). I might be missing a couple of special features on the very last disc but to me it looks like the rest of the special features for the other 7 movies are included in both collections.

Which collection should you buy? If you want to save loads of money and still have almost all of the special features then buy the 16 disc version versus the 31 disc collection. IF you don't have a Blu-Ray DVD player then my suggestion is buy the 16 disc collection and with all that money you didn't spend on the 31 disc collection buy a dang Blu-Ray player. ;) Hope this helps and leaves you less confused!",1512172800,,2188,4.324390243902439
4557693,4,B00543R3WG,"Enjoyable movie for the Harry Potter fan. Excellent acting for the most part (minus Colin Farrell). Particularly enjoyed Dan Fogler as Kowalski.

The best part were the scenes with the fantastic beasts (makes sense). But, a major plot hole to me kept popping up and creating a lot of annoyance for me. At one point we see the process we saw in the Harry Potter movies with the memories being removed and viewed. There's also a scene that includes that process in this movie (I won't go into detail).

But, if accusers and authorities are able to to extract and view memories, why the need for interrogation and falsely imprisoning? They could easily have proven that Newt's intentions were honorable and that Tina wasn't involved in any wrongdoing.

That one point, so obvious (and used in the movie) really took me out of the ""suspended disbelief"" that is normally so easy to do with the Harry Potter movies.

Overall, enjoyed but didn't feel this was on par with any of the HP offerings. Still, worth a watch",1512172800,,1010,4.6892655367231635

Before buying this collection, I read that some people had problems with one of the discs missing, or being the wrong movie all together, but I tested all of them out and didn't have that problem.

4557723,5,B00543R3WG,"This is a fantastic harry potter set. The Hogwarts Collection is the definitive version of harry potter and a MUST have for any harry potter fans.
Note that there are several different versions of this set.
The first one being the basic dvd 8 film set, which is old and will tend to have scratches.

The second one is being the basic blu ray 8 film set which is also old so the case for it isn't the best I hear.

The thrid one is the 16 disk blue ray collection with an ultraviolet digital code.

The fourth one being the ultimate set aka the Hogwarts Collection It includes 31 disks in total, both in blue ray and dvd. The only extended editions are year 1 and 2 though on blu ray. Also the extra disk which is exlusive to this set is also only on blu ray. I just love that it also has those classic dvd games that were included on the first releases of harry potter movies. They don't put the mini games on the dvds anymore these days so it was nice to see that again here.

The ultraviolet digital code YES STILL WORKS.

To redeem go to the OFFICAL ultraviolet site, once you put it your code it will re-direct you to vudu were you can log in and just like magic, it's been added to your vudu account! If you threw away the code because you were dumb enough to go to vudu directly, thats your problem not mine.",1512086400,2,1314,4.137254901960785

4557764,2,B00543R3WG,"This review is for the Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection (all movies in Blu-Ray Extended format, DVD format, and supposedly digital download).

PROS: Beautifully packaged, looks like an old book with discs in great condition. Great special features.
CONS: Digital ""downloads"" are not downloads but hosted, the codes for online versions are expired and the company defunct.

I ordered this in November, 2017 (the date will be important, trust). The case is beautiful, and folds out like a little book. The DVDs and BluRays work great, the bonus material on them is interesting enough for anyone who is a fan of the series -- but the problem comes in with the digital downloads.

First, the downloads are not ""downloads."" They are available via online access through a company known as UltraViolet HD (interestingly enough, they are also not available for download in HD according to the back of the box), not for download via iTunes/Microsoft/Google directly to your device. To watch them you have to download an app that they are hosted on, much like watching something on Netflix.

Now, heres the fun stuff: this company, UltraViolet HD/Flixster went out of business in August and the site link supplied in their boxset directs you to their new parent company VUDU. Despite what the old UltraViolet/Flixster website says, VUDU does not recognize this code because it **expired in March of 2016**. The product description on Amazon claims that the redemption code for the digital version of this boxset has been extended to 12/31/19, but I don't think anyone updated VUDU on that deal.

I have now tried the website supplied in the boxset, tried entering the code on VUDU (which does not recognize it) and tried entering the code on VUDU's version of UltraViolet (which tells me to enter it on VUDU!!!). This was sold to me as a new and multiformat set, but is expired - if someone can come along and clarify how to redeem the online versions then I will gladly edit my review.",1511654400,6,1976,4.886567164179104
4557765,5,B00543R3WG,"This review is about the set, not the movies. You either like Harry Potter or you don't. I assume that only the former is looking at this set.

Ok, THIS is how a boxed set should be. I've read some horror stories about other sets being mis-matched discs from previous releases (the X-Men collections) and I've seen the beauty that is The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition boxed set (another thing of beauty.) A truly cohesive production with original artwork on every disc. (When was it decided that Blu-ray discs didn't need artwork?)

In truth, I have only just opened the set and have not even inserted one disc into my player. But I wanted to post something now to get one piece of info out there... How to get your digital copy!

I'd read reviews about the codes being expired, so didn't have any expectations. Having bought the set at less than half price on Black Friday, I didn't care. But, since the code was in my hand, I figured why not try.

The original provider of these codes was Flixster. They have been out of the Ultraviolet business for about a year now. Vudu filled their spot. A very good change, since the Vudu interface on all my hardware blows away what Flixster used to have. So I went to Vudu.com, but no love there. Received a message that the code had expired. Had to try. Then I did a little digging on the web and someone suggested going straight to Ultraviolet's web site, myuv.com. At first it didn't look promising, until I noticed down in the lowest left corner of the screen that there was a link to ""Redeem Code."" I entered my code, the screen took a moment, then said I'd have to go to Vudu to complete my registration of my code. I thought it was just sending my to Vudu's main screen and that it hadn't worked. No, it directed me to a confirmation screen that the movies had been added to my collection. I've since signed back into my account, and there they are.",1511654400,7,1903,4.3977272727272725

Most of the discs have smudges on them. The only reason I even noticed the smudges on the discs is because the center 'disc holder' thing is pretty worn out, it doesn't securely click back in.

4557771,1,B00543R3WG,"This is only the second movie in my 52 years I've walked out on, and that was because my 11 year old son said he was bored. The simple fact is, so was I, so we left. We walked. On a $50 freaking movie bill, we walked.

I wanted to give it another chance, but, guess what, it is still dull and boring. I've forced my way through 40 minutes, and just can't handle watching more. The characters, we don't care about. The situations, overdone. In fact, my feeling is, they were trying just too hard . They had some awfully big shoes to fill, and they were just trying too hard to do it. The pacing was just way too slow, but more than that I just couldn't really empathize with the characters. When you care about the characters, the pacing takes a back seat. It just seemed to go on and on about how magic stuff works -- but we already knew that. It needed to not be some kind of thing that needed to be emphasized, a focus on character and faster pacing would have helped. I mean, for one example, is it really necessary to show dishes flying into place on a table? In a rather prolonged sequence? Haven't we all seen this before? Show it happening, sure... 10 seconds worth would be enough though. Maybe the muggle, or ""nomag"" or whatever, was awed by it -- I wasn't. And even that guy, good grief, just seemed to accept it all without questioning. I mean, OK. Just a few minutes later, your roommate for the night jumps down a bag. Do you wonder what the Hell is going on? No, obviously, you just follow him down. And get a ""joke"", and a poor one, in about his girth. Didn't fat jokes go out of style some time ago? Or does that only apply to women?

I think the main problem is that the main protagonists are way, way too passive. Newt is passive to the point of almost apathy. That could be played on as a man out of his own element (England v. US), but it never really was. Even the main lady just takes a load of crap, never even expresses how that makes her feel... if this is all leading up to some sort of boiling point, I'm sorry; the writers screwed up. You don't make your audience wait through an hour or more of BS to get there. And again, Newt is so passive as to be unlikable; not good. Or for at least the first 40 minutes, the ""star"" kind of just gets led around by others, not really doing a damn thing. Is that really how Englishmen are? I've met a few. Not in my experience. In fact, Englishmen are very direct, in most cases, where us yanks would not be. This stereotype of the ""proper English Gentleman"" can be taken just so far before it becomes tedious -- unless you're playing it for laughs (Monty Python anyone?). Real people are not like that, even in England. Or at least, I certainly hope not and believe not. And for heaven's sakes, this was mainly made by Englishmen.

All in all, I just simply can't recommend this. I am truly, truly sorry. I very much wanted this to be ""the new Harry Potter"". It just isn't, plain and simple. I didn't want it to be like this, it's just how it turned out. Attack me if you must, but I do ask that any response be reasonable and salient and address the basic issues. I don't need, and won't respond, to personal attacks.",1511654400,,3185,4.200980392156863

I clicked in because I enjoy getting other's opinions and insights on movies, and instead of people discussing the world of Fantastic Beasts, we have discussions about the different content of Harry Potter boxed sets.

We happened to have a free afternoon so I just pulled out the final BluRay disc today and it is completely ruined.

As a die-hard Potterhead for over 15 years, I really wanted to watch the Potters again on my first Blu-Ray player and thus began the search for the perfect collection where I can get both the movies and the special features without missing anything. The result of course, was futile, but that didn't discourage me. I came across 3 editions here, the old ""3 faces of Harry"" UK version (the priciest, about $85), the US version with the Hogwarts castle cover (a bit cheaper, about $68) and this one, being the new UK version (the cheapest, about $44). What I found-out interestingly enough though, is that in terms of completeness, this version seems to be by far the best one, especially considering its price. Having said that though, it's not without its quirks.

The collection being a 16-disc set with an array of special features, it seems to easily defeat the 8-disc US version by a mile. When compared with the old 11-disc UK version though, it still seems to win, but not by a whole lot. So let me give a quick run-down of the features which I believe are missing in this when compared to it-

1) Minimal interactive disc menus for the movies- what you get for the most part are small, neat, pop-up menus that have all the buttons of course, just without the background menu animations of the original DVDs
2) Next to none interactive games- I remember that there were a few small games in the original Goblet of Fire special disc which were not in here. Not a big deal really, but they still should have been in this ""complete"" version.
3) Light packaging- with cardboard disc sleeves that have a lot to be desired. Clearly a move to cut-down on the pricing, which I appreciate in some ways, but the 4 very delicate cases really are quite awkward for holding 4 discs each, I had a small tear in one case upon receiving it. The artworks are ok though.

However there are a lot of special features here amounting to hours upon hours of material which I believe are not in the old UK version, making this the more preferable. The beautiful 8-hour ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentary and the compilation of TV specials/spots contained here chief among them.

Apart from that, what it does have is every single special feature of the original discs, from the numerous and highly enjoyable documentary featurettes and Focus Points to the fascinating, but at times irksome visual commentaries of the last 3 films. They are very fun to watch for any Potterhead and I enjoyed them all a lot. Really takes you into the production of these feats of magic and makes you feel as if you're engaging with the cast/crew then and there. I do wish however, that the cast/crew did some audio commentaries for the films, it would have been great to hear them react to various scenes, reliving their experiences impromptu and giving some insights on the go, nothing really beats that.

As for the movies themselves, I don't think that anyone who's into Fantasy/Adventure can really not enjoy a Harry Potter movie, at least guiltily. I'm not going to touch on them a lot since this is not entirely a movie review, but apart from being my childhood, they are some of the best in the genre and the best thing about them is that they always hold-up as engaging, cinematically sensible movies first and as parts of a series, second. I've seen them in various formats throughout the years, from the cinema to DVDs/VCDs, and the transfers here are pretty-well done, though nothing much to write home about. The video quality is enriched by just a tiny bit and the audio is decent though I just wish that they had 7.1 instead of the 5.1. And although being in Widescreen (which I prefer), the black-bars here seemed to be fixed on a 1080p and that was a little disappointing since it limits the detail of the images a little bit.

The only issue I had with the movie discs was that the last one seemed to have some bad data as it kind of skipped for about 10 seconds in the Hog's Head scene. Quite disappointing since it was supposed to be a primed disc. Another annoying issue I had with the discs is that some of the special features, like the ""Meet the Champions"" documentary from the Goblet of Fire was repeated in both the movie disc, and the special features disc. This was true for most of the deleted scenes as well. It just seems like a cheap and lazy move on part of the disc-makers to fill-up disc space.

The other thing about the special features is that although they're quite enjoyable, they tend to have a lot of the same things, like interviews, repeated/edited throughout in multiple features. The 8-hour documentary avoids that for the most part thankfully, but it can get boring to hear the same lines repeated over and over again, especially in the old TV specials. This is especially annoying since the cast/crew seems to read heavily off a script for most of them and some even seems to just use multiple takes across them in some instances, which was weird. There are for the most part, no new titbits touched upon in many of them, so it can get too old too quickly.

The Ultraviolet is available in the UK and not in Asia, where I live. But I don't like downloading huge files so it's no great loss to me either way.

Overall though, this is quite a solid buy of a collection and gets most things right. It's certainly going to be the only Potter collection I'll have for the foreseeable future. Recommended for anyone interested in the genre.

Rating for the special features, packaging and presentation- 2/4",1510963200,2,5805,4.737623762376238

Pros:
Eddie Redmaynes nuanced performance. If they write him out of the series I will be sorely pissed off. His character arc has sooo much room for growth in very interesting ways.
The cast was excellent, giving brilliant interpretations to their characters.
Brilliant storytelling (off to an excellent start!)
Fantastic, colorful, beautifully designed beasts - CGI was excellent.
3D format was very good.
A Harry Potter series made for adults.

Cons:

I really wish the digital version on Amazon were cheaper or anywhere but they are $70 and you don't even get the extra bonus or disc etc... so this was a great deal.

Not much to say otherwise, we thought about just renting them on Amazon or iTunes but it was cheaper to just buy them and then have them to watch again if we wanted to.

Hope this helps! If you haven't been to Harry Potter in Universal be sure and check it out. It's like being in the movie, crazy cool! Waiting on the 4K UHD versions to buy as well",1509926400,,704,3.9160839160839163

4557885,4,B00543R3WG,"You don't need to be familiar with the Harry Potter franchise at all to be able to enjoy this spin-off that is aimed at adults, though the storyline and characterizations are overall pretty safe for most older kids, but not the younger set. What I did have an issue with and can see others take issue with is how the bad person is a bigoted religious fanatic who took in kids and then was physically abusive to them. The religion is not specifically identified but most sane people will recognize that it smacks of Christianity. The problem is not that this person is portrayed as the bad person and has a religious bent, its that there is no balance given to them (how many movies can you think of where the bad guy is humanized to the point of empathy?) and so it feels like the film goes out of its way to take a whack at Christianity/ Christians as being hypocritical, angry, fear-mongering individuals. Thats a problem and while I did like the movie I didn't like that element all the moreso because there was no effort to counterbalance it. While the HP villain Voldemort was an adult he did make use of younger kids but they were never as intensely corrupted, or portrayed in such a way, as FBAWTFT portrays them. The issue of child abuse, regardless of who is abusing the child, and makes the films characterizations that much more insidious. These elements are disturbing and will probably be too disturbing to children 9 and under Id wager. Many Christians will have a problem with the whole witches, wizards, and witchcraft/ magic stuff but if you set that aside this is simply another fantasy adventure with more of an emphasis this time around on the strange and fantastic creatures that the hero tends to. The hero is an adult, as are his companions in this film, and so it gives it a different feel. Its a lesser entry into the franchise though enjoyable for people who like watching fanciful creatures and monsters and magical doings. 3.75 stars.",1509494400,,1962,4.6085714285714285

 Tour de force animation, if you can suspend your disbelief. Quite amazing.

SPOILER ALERT:

I love that none of the animals were cuddly and all were quite naughty by human standards. I watched some crazy people on YouTube earlier today trying to raise and keep a wild fox in their house and a similar level of hilarity and destruction occurred, e.g. jumping up on furniture to knock everything off and then poop! On the furniture. Tables & couches & whatnot.

Wild animals are wild and belong in their habitats. Who knew that a magic movie could make this point so beautifully? Unless you're running a certified & professional wild animal rehabilitation facility - or are a world expert on magical beasts - don't bring them into your kitchen, or if you do, expect mayhem to ensue!",1506643200,,889,4.4753086419753085

Anything in the Harry Potter universe is going to be fun, and this is no exception. The magic effects were good and the new beasts were charming. The novelty of it being set in America kept things interesting, and subtle callbacks to plot points we already know made it familiar as well.

That being said, the plot was a little disjointed, and I don't think the love story between the two main characters was believable. The ending was somewhat underwhelming, but not horrible by any means.

3/5 really says it. If you're a fan of the series then you'll probably like it, but don't expect it to knock your socks off.",1506124800,,665,4.571428571428571

Every 5 minutes I looked at the time. When is the movie going to get interesting and enchanting, I wondered? It never does. The sets, costumes, cinematography, and acting are all bleak, depressing and lacking in energy. The Americans are played by Brits who apparently think that all it takes to portray an American is an accent. Americans of that era were plucky and way more charismatic than the dour way they were portrayed here. This is an incredibly, massively boring movie, and the magic and animals lacked creativity.  Not JK's best source material, and definitely the worst of her books that made it to film.  Skip this and watch any of the Harry Potter movies instead.",1506038400,,818,4.746478873239437

Not so. There is no plot to speak of; what story is there does not make sense, the characters are flat and one dimensional, and the beasts serve as eye candy at best (and not even the best CGI eye candy you can get these days). JK was clearly just cashing this one in; I'm surprised she let her name go down as the writer. Not worth the time if you are older than 5.",1506038400,2,540,4.152380952380953

Update: After being told that the 3rd dvd just jumps into a really long preview of Polar Express, I'm changing the review from 1-star to 4-star. It's pretty good for a 8-film collection. The only issue is that, although the fifth disc looks fine, it starts freezing up a bit about halfway through the movie. Just a little bit, on and off, for about 10 minutes; then it's fine again.",1505779200,,576,4.433962264150943

4558363,3,B00543R3WG,"Fantastic Beasts has great characters. Honestly, some of the most genuine and likeable characters i've seen in awhile. I wanted to root for these characters. I wanted to see these characters grow and evolve. I wanted to learn more about the creatures and why Newt has become so attached to protecting and learning about them. So, I was pretty disappointed to see where the film went and how it ultimately ended.

The plot is just too heavy and gives no room for character development. The movie seems so focused on building the world and the American Magical Police/Government system that it barely takes time to explain anything it brings up. The beasts (you know, the creatures the movie is named after) are rarely shown or really spoken about and serve only as a MacGuffin and eventually a Deus ex Machina for the plot. And the plot itself is all over the place. Bouncing between plotlines I really could care less about and special effect extravaganzas that leave no lasting impact on the story. I was honestly bored through most of the film. I wanted a story about the characters and instead I got a bland story about the corruption of the American magical society and some evil guy who really had no reason being there. Which is extremely disappointing considering what they had to work with.

I've heard of people absolutely loving this film. And, i'm really glad to hear it. Because I want this franchise to continue, if only for them to actually focus on the characters and drop the pointless side plots. I was never a fan of Harry Potter, so I don't know how well fans of that franchise will react to this movie. It's definitely not Harry Potter. However, i'd recommend people watch it if only for the characters. I do look forward to the next film, I just hope it'll fix the problems of this one.",1504396800,,1807,4.626168224299065

The special effects are the real star, as they always are in the magical movies, but the cast does a great job as well.  Even though this is a sort of prequel to the Harry Potter series, it has nothing to do with the Potter family.  Instead it is showing the rather eccentric author's adventures while writing part of one of Harry's textbooks.

J.K. Rowling gives us another taste of the magical world that we all know and love from Harry Potter only this time giving the focus to some new characters as well as magical creatures.
The story is very smooth with just enough suspense, action, and drama so keep you awake and interested throughout the whole movie. While the characters are so well written that you often find yourself having a love hate relationship with some of them as they make certain choices throughout the story/movie.
To touch on the special effects and graphics of the creatures and actions I can only say that they keep getting better and better and I am at a loss for how they make magical moments on screen come to life for those of us watching it.",1503964800,,837,4.337579617834395

You've got 2 foot long bird snakes blowing up instantly into 300 foot long bird snakes, then shrinking down into 6 inch bird snakes, and other such nonsense. You've got 20 thousand pound rhinoceroses fitting into suitcases. You've got a vial of blue liquid that gives amnesia to an entire city. You've got spells that can reconstruct a destroyed sky-scraper in an instant. It's completely over the top. I know it's a movie about magic, but even so the best movies and series about magic have rules.  When you make a character all powerful with magic, he no longer has to be creative or clever with his use of it, and that's a lot less entertaining.

My only feedback is the packaging of the discs.  They come in nice cardboard folders, like modern music cds. However, the discs keep sliding out onto the floor. There's nothing holding them ""in"" and they slide out. Plus the silkscreen is difficult to read which movie is which when sorting and placing them back in the jacket. I'm considering taping the bonus discs so they don't fall out too.

As for the streaming.  It isn't technically available in the USA.  Others have posted how to do it but it's not a service I want to sign up for anyhow.",1502755200,2,651,4.391666666666667

You no longer are looking through Harry's child/teen's POV, but to a new character who seems so sad, but still sees the world in an entirely new light. The creatures are clearly designed well and Warner Bros. team took their time to shape and create this new timeline in the HP universe.

I imagine kids have loved this, but so did myself and my dad in our 20's and 50's respectively. I can't wait to see this franchise further expand onto the HP universe, and to be quite honest, even if you weren't the biggest Harry Potter fan, this movie is both similar enough to draw in old fans, but also bring about new ones and enjoy the Fantastic Beasts that lie within.",1502323200,,794,4.364864864864865

4558647,5,B00543R3WG,"Package came in pristine condition, Blu-ray Discs looked perfect and played well in my PS4. Here are a few things that I noticed with these region free discs: the feature plays after the disc is loaded, there is no traditional ""menu"", though there are menu options of ""scene selection"", ""bonus features"", and ""language."" Blu-ray Discs  normally remember a disc being previously viewed and offer to start where you left off; these don't do that. I mention these things because they may bug some, but it doesn't affect the final product.

As far as UV redemption, it's as simple as logging into flixster video and initiating a chat where you provide all of the necessary information. A help ticket is created via email at which point you attach pictures of the UV code + receipt. The requests are taken care of in the order it was received.

I was pretty disappointed. I kept waiting for it to really kick in, but it never did for me.
I WANTED to love it. I am an Eddie Redmayne fan, too, so I had high hopes.  I loved Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol's characters, and their storyline was, for me, one of the best parts of the movie.
For some reason I found myself not connecting to the woman Redmayne's character was drawn to. She kept trying to get him into trouble, and then ended up in trouble herself. I though, ""Good!"" lol. Sorry if you loved it. It was just not as good as I think it could be, and left me underwhelmed.",1502064000,,620,4.12396694214876

Not sure how this was slapped together, but the Half Blood Prince disc appears to have been taken from a multi disc set of its own, or another set with more then one disc for that movie, as it says DISC 1. None of the other discs in the set are numbered.  It also does not interact with my blue ray player or playstation 4 the same way the rest of the discs do. This seems extremely odd considering this is advertised as a complete/official set.",1501977600,,510,4.09
4558665,2,B00543R3WG,"Review for Fantastic Beasts.

It's hard to give this movie two stars. There were a lot of great things about it.

So why two stars? The main focus of the plot was lazy, trite, and completely missed the mark for what this movie SHOULD have been about.

So I give it one star for the special effects, and one star for the sequences with the magical beasts, and no more.

This SHOULD have been an interesting, fun, and memorable movie for kids of all ages. Instead much of it was dark and terrifying for kids. It speaks to the over-developed proclivity for darkness and tragedy that Rowling for some reason developed as the Harry Potter series moved along. This movie quickly became as schizophrenic as the later Potter books. Rowling has a great capacity for wonder, humor, and delightful slice of life scenes -- even if it is magical life. However, she at some point also wanted to be SERIOUS, and it detracted from her ability to entertain with her best storytelling qualities.

This movie demonstrates that clearly. The ""obscurius"" plot was from the odd desire to be serious, when a better story was obviously at hand just in the effort to recapture the creatures which had escaped. Cut out the dark nonsense, and you have a really great 40 minute or so movie.

For the product itself: The 3D blu ray presentation is excellent. There is a great sense of depth, and some objects/creatures come right out of the screen. I have nothing but praise for the technical aspects of the film and the product.",1501977600,,1499,4.616541353383458

Then there is a second disc to accompany each movie that contains lots of extras including behind the scenes, interviews, the shows that ran on the Bio channel many years ago, etc. Everything was in good shape and plays well.  The ""sleeves"" that hold the discs are thin and don't hold the discs too well but at this cost, I can't complain! Just a little extra care and the sleeves should last. I was even able to get the ultraviolet versions by simply contacting Flixster and asking for the ultra violet versions. They uploaded them to my account within hours.

4558772,1,B00543R3WG,"The premise seems interesting and relevant to our times: an eco-zoologist trying to save endangered species, a person spewing hate for those who are different, and a variety of characters acting to make the world better according to their own conflicting viewpoints. And the CGI is truly remarkable.

But as the final deus ex machina unfolded, I found myself wishing that I had those two hours back. And wondering why the wizarding world would every be afraid of 1920s no-majs (er, muggles). Or why the European magic community was so selfish as to not help with the rebuilding effort after WWII.

My biggest issue with the film is that it completely lacked nuance. The bad guys were very bad, the good guys were bumbling but destined to win, and all the little plot twists that could have been interesting were thrown away almost as soon as they were introduced. And then there was that ""prison"" scene that made me wonder if all of the American witches and warlocks are simply psychopaths.

On top of that, the acting just wasn't that good. I don't blame the actors for this; I blame the CGI. I have to believe that a green screen wipes away empathy and emotion in a way that a set or even a bare stage does not. At times it was simply painful to watch, as when Newt interacts with some of the larger beasts. Perhaps a motion-capture puppet would have helped? Or perhaps not.",1501372800,,1376,4.585365853658536

What made the magic was the chemistry among players with Daniel Radcliff that made the movie shine.
This movie reminds me of the Star wars sequels & prequels where they use extensive special effects to fill the gap of it's missing lead cast that made the original films dynamic.
The special effects are there but not the magic, or the intrigue to find out what lies beyond hidden plots.",1501286400,,489,4.50561797752809

To view the bonus material on movies 1-5 you have to go all the way through the movie, the credits, and 35 screens of ""warning"" in different languages, then the special feature screen appears.

4558830,3,B00543R3WG,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan (of both the books and the movies). That said, I am very possessive of that storyline, and so I was a little hesitant to watch this other movie because I didn't want anything to tarnish the Harry Potter world for me. I finally got around to watching Fantastic Beasts, and while it was a decent movie, I admit I do feel let down. It relies heavily on all the background constructed in Harry Potter, and so many viewers dove into this film with an already established knowledge of the wizarding world. With that in place, though, it did not focus enough on the character development needed to endear viewers to this new saga...and new characters. Eddie Redmayne fulfilled his role as an awkward but kind ""animal"" lover and protector, but aside from that, I don't feel like the audience got to connect with him or any of the other characters on an emotional level. There were also a few things going on that didn't jive with what I know about J.K. Rowling's wizarding world. The movie itself is more sinister, and the argument could be made that this movie was more adult and therefore more maturely themed, but it wasn't compelling enough for me. The magic I felt in the Harry Potter movies just never transcended. The CGI beasts and settings were very impressive, but I needed a bit more; I didn't care about them aside from admiring their appearances. And I felt no chemistry between Newt and Tina, so I didn't understand their friendship and/or budding romance.

If I view this as a standalone movie, and not connected to Harry Potter, my opinion of it may be a little bit higher than the 3 stars. But because the Harry Potter movies were so good, and this is an extension of that world, my opinion dropped because it was lackluster in comparison.",1500854400,,1777,4.570532915360501

BUT, one thing that irritated the hell out of me, I could not clearly hear what the actors were saying in some scenes unless I turned my volume up to 100.  In some scenes  it sounded like Eddie Redmayne had a mouth full of marbles.  I don't understand why the sound engineers feel the greater need to blast the actions sequences, but fail to keep the voices at the same level.  It had a story & I don't find that once again the sound engineers feel that they need to pay more attention to the volume of the actions scenes. IMHO.

Does not dissapoint.,1500163200,,298,4.6415094339622645
4558931,3,B00543R3WG,"Fantastic Beasts was full of strong performances, took the Potter world into a darker, different direction, but I felt as if the narrative lost its direction and veered into something more epic than I really wanted. Now, thats said from a guy that loves epic fantasy, that writes epic fantasy, that pushed on reading through 14, 900+ page novels of the Wheel of Time, despite 100s of pages where nothing happened of note. The simple reason I say this is because the derailing change in tone for Fantastic Beasts wasn't needed.

*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*  Though really, it's pretty obvious in the movie.

Newts story of visiting New York, losing some of his animals and having to find them, felt a lot more interesting to me than the eventual Grindelwald reveal with his desires to out wizard society and stop hiding behind the scenes; bringing about the eventual no-maj and wizard war that would result. While I wanted to see all of those underhanded dealings, and Farrells character was a beautiful mix of conflicted power and passion, I was annoyed as the retrieval of the beasts took a back seat.

One of the brilliant parts of Harry Potter is it started small. Yes, it was evident that Potter was akin to a chosen one, but for the most part it seemed that his time in the spotlight had already come and passed. His celebration was for what he had done, not for what he would do. Fantastic Beasts misses that beat for me, by trying to start too big right out of the gate. I loved the budding relationship with the baker, as Newt's strangely willing sidekick, and while we got some vignette scenes of them in the suitcase displaying Newts passion for the odd and magical, the release and recapture of the beasts was thoroughly trumped by building Story B.

Im not Rowling, but my inner writer was screaming to want to rewrite the script and push Story B into hints and foreshadowing that could lay the path to explode prominently on the scene in the sequel to Fantastic Beasts. There was enough drama and fun to let the retrieval of the beasts stand on its own as THE story.

I also have to say the climactic conclusion was just a back and forth mess where direction was lacking and it seemed the characters weren't even sure what they were supposed to be doing. Eventually it came together, and yes: it was big, it was tense, but the excitement and edge of your seat anticipation just felt forced.

Nevertheless, it was a solid movie, stronger than some of the Potter movies, even if it missed some of the pacing of the Harry Potter books.

As a fan of the Potterverse, one of the most exciting parts of the movie was imagining what may come with Rowling (maybe) delving into other side stories and building the world still greater and larger. Potter's story may be done, but there is so much more to tell.

I got this version that was listed as Blu-Ray but less than the default option. The description said 16 disks so I didn't ask questions and would see what it came with. This box came with Blu-ray and sound track for each movie of the movie AND the Digital downloads for them. This set isn't the American version with the Sorcerer's  Stone it's the UK version (Philosopher's stone (meaning that they change the few lines and the title from one to the other so it has little to no difference)). Because of the digital downloads being relative to the UK I needed to use a VPN to make my computer think I was either in Ireland or the UK otherwise the code comes up as invalid.
Because of this set having digital movies I am able to trophy the actual box and not have to take out the disks when I decided i want to watch one of the movies (the way today's media should be). If you know how to use a VPN and are a fan of the series this version of the set it great (my code said it didn't expire until 2019 and was 1 code for 8 movies).

4558953,2,B00543R3WG,"Please let me start by saying that Ive seen all (8) HP movies more times than I can count. I never read the books, but if (pretty much) the SAME people that produced one of the best series ever put to film could bring us another series in the HP universe, its going to be great, right?

Boy, was I wrong! I fell asleep twice, maybe three times. It was difficult to stay awake. The level of creativity, thought, and imagination is really missing from this movie. Its as if they had to put something (anything?) together for HP fans since 5 years has passed when the last film was released.

I don't think these are spoilers if you still haven't seen it yet (Yup! I know this movie has been out for a long time), but here are just some of my problems with the story and the film:

- Eddie Redmayne is such a great actor, and yet, he mumbled throughout the entire movie, I could barely understand a word he said. I turned up the sound, and still couldn't understand most of his dialog, but almost blew an eardrum when the destructive scenes played throughout NY.
- By the way, why was this film set in NY? I realize this isn't HP, but it wasn't necessary to change the setting either. The few good parts of film were inside the suitcase Newt was carrying anyway. Other than a few Americans, most of the main cast were foreign actors trying to sound American. I felt like they spent more time trying to get the accent right than their scenes.
- No-Majs? Really? Instead of calling them muggles, this is the lousiest word they can come up with for non-magic people in America.
- The movie would have been better without Tina (Katherine Waterston). It was just too irritating to watch her clumsy attempts at capturing Newt and his escaped creatures. I got the impression she spent most of her time trying to justify her position at the Magical Congress. Instead, she often came off like a nagging tattletale. Even when she and Newt were about to be put to death, its hard to believe she had any magic at all. I mean, shes supposed to be law enforcement, too, and she just stood there and did nothing to help herself as they tried to drown her in a white sterile room with a chair hovering over a pool of water. Really? Some of the worst visual effects they could come up with in the magical world! Once again, no creativity.
- The interactions between Credence (Ezra Miller) and Colin Farrell (Graves) were disturbing. I understand Credence was so broken from the abuse of his adopted mother, but Graves made it more creepy the way he shadowed him in dark places and back alleys, even if it was for just an exchange of information.

Im only giving 2 stars because even though the human actors were awful, the magical creatures were endearing and hilarious at times. Even Newts quest to save and help them is one we can all learn from too.

I gave this movie a shot because of HP, but it simply didn't live up to expectations for me. There was no character development or depth. They just showed up and let loose on us to figure out. Sprinkling a few names tied to the HP universe (Hogwarts, Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore) only helps as a foot in the door.

I know a lot of people loved this movie, including those with questionable 1 line reviews.

In spite of loyalty to HP, I really tried to like FBaWTFT because it stood alone, and was genuinely good-- but for me, it wasnt, so I couldnt. I think they are planning to make 4 more movies. I hope they do the next one rightpleeeease make it better!",1499904000,2,3493,4.3894899536321486

Just lovely to see an unexpected backstory that (eventually) ties into the Harry Potter series without having a predetermined image in my mind of the characters or how the plot was handled/interpreted by the film makers. Also adds depth to our understanding of the background in the main Harry Potter canon. Looking forward to revelations as the remaining adventures unfold in future films.

While the characters each had lines, I could clearly see that ""Jacob tilted his head,"" that Newt ""twisted and turned,"" and that other characters walked down the street, into buildings, etc.  Yes, the narrator told you ever little detail when the characters were not speaking.  I forced myself to watch the whole movie because it could have been a great movie, without the narrator.

Any scenes with their direct involvement were glorious and made the imagination run wild as they were given a ""physical"" form and ""facts"" about their habitats and lifestyles. And the romance between Jacob and Queenie was rather adorable! Jacob's ending was heartbreaking and beautiful and although I do approve of the cliffhanger, I would be more than happy to read a story about his future and how his past could affect it!

My only complaint and the reason for the 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars is the uncomfortably forced romance between Newt and Tina. Tina causes the major conflict at the end of the story by repeatedly persecuting Newt despite him wanting to do nothing but preserve the misunderstood and unfairly persecuted magical species and being his own special and sincerely awkward self. And somehow, despite it being more logical for him to hate her and never want to deal with her again, he somehow feels romantically inclined towards her! And despite her being a terrible person and causing so much havoc in such a short time span FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN she somehow has the balls to feel the same way!

4559097,4,B00543R3WG,"How do you make a Harry Potter film without Harry Potter in it?  Well this is the question that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has had to answer.

Set in a wizarding 1920s New York City, the story centers on two plot lines.

The first plot line is around Newt Scamander.  Newt is a scientist who has a resemblance to Doctor Who, as his strange and cunning outlook has the trademarks of the epic character. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs them into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen.  When his suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to the""No-Maj"" (non magical) Jacob, some of Newt's fantastic beasts escape and cause problems in New York.  This leads to a whole bunch of funny scenes.

The second plot line centers on the Magical Congress of the United States of America or (MACUSA) and their efforts to hide the magical world.  This brings us Percival Graves and his obsession with finding magical children who have suppressed their abilities through fear to the point where they become something known as an Obscurus, more or less a huge glob of black smoke. Now this part of the film is dark, and not as entertaining.

The casting for Fantastic Beasts was fantastic.  We loved Eddie Redmayne in the main role as Newt Scamander. He portrays perfectly the awkward and introverted character that prefers the company of animals rather than humans. Another great addition is Dan Fogler as the bumbling Jacob Kowalski, who is thrust into the magical world by chance.  The actor playing Percival Graves is certainly believable.

The biggest challenge we had going into this, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking this effort, Id have to say he pulls it off.  See.. the movie is pretty good.  Comparisons are unavoidable but let's remember, magic or no magic, this is a spin-off, no Harry Potter in here!  For newcomers, this movie is a good way to enter the Wizarding World that you have missing so far!  It isn't Harry Potter - but we liked it.",1498435200,10,2100,4.650406504065041

From the moment she saw the trailer, she pegged Fantastic Beasts as being awful. Her prediction was true. The plot was overly convoluted. ***Spoilers***  There didn't need to be a bad guy, especially one that they never explaied how NS discovered who he was. There was no need for the Second Salemers or whatever they were called. There was no need for Jon Voight or his sons. The plot of the movie should have been simple: Newts Beasts Escape and he gets the help of a local 'Nomadge"" and others to help him track them down while the magical Congress of the USA is trying to capture and kill the beasts. It seems like JK did everything she could do in an attempt to tie it in with HP, but it just destroyed the movie.

4559124,2,B00543R3WG,"SPOILERS:  For me there was only one interesting plotline here, and it was Credence's.  He was the only character I was interested in or felt anything for. Ezra Miller was the only interesting actor.  The entire movie could have been about children who were taken into that orphanage to have their magic literally beaten out of them, and it would have been a lot more interesting.  I was very disappointed that the magical community killed Credence.  It sucked and was such a cliched ending of his story to me: kill the misfit.  Usually, J.K. Rowling is more innovative than that. I did find myself wondering why Tom Riddle wasn't an obscurus, but then he wasn't suppressing his magical abilities even as a child.

Most of the movie was boring and way too long. The plot was minimal and frankly stupid.  The attempts at humor and relationships were flat.  For the most part, I think this was a waste of a story in the wizarding world. The slim Fantastic Beasts book was not enough to base a story on.",1498262400,,1000,4.573033707865169

4559141,5,B00543R3WG,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great movie, almost a prequel to the Harry Potter series.  It features Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, a zoologist of magical creatures, passing through 1920's New York City with a suitcase full of magic.  The suitcase accidentally gets swapped for that of a would-be baker, and mayhem ensues.

Newt will find himself up against the local ""Ministry of Magic"" and the local muggles anti-magic society.  He makes one friend out of the would-be baker, Jacob Kowalski, and another out of a local auror, Tina Goldstein.  The race to retrieve the missing beasts, however, will run smack into an ancient and unexpected evil, brining unwanted attention to an already desperate situation...

This is a fun movie, full of humor and imagination, with more than a few thrills and some tense moments.  The production values are first rate.  Highly recommended to fans of the Harry Potter series...",1498176000,,933,5.012987012987013

4559176,4,B00543R3WG,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it.",1497916800,,1738,4.825503355704698

4559213,5,B00543R3WG,"I feel I need to preface this review by saying that, while I enjoy the Harry Potter books (I'm not a rabid fan but found them to be an entertaining read with a fascinating world within their pages), I've never been a big fan of the films.  Call me a book purist, but whenever I watch a film based on a book I can't help but nitpick it to death, complaining about what has been changed from page to screen and what was left out until people want to smack me into silence.  So my first thought when I heard about the ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" film was ""how on Earth are they going to turn such a slim little volume about the creatures of the Harry Potter books into a full-length movie?""  But I finally gave in to curiosity and had a look.  If nothing else, then perhaps a wholly original story set in the Harry Potter world would sit better with me than one cribbed right from the books.

""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" turned out to be a great movie, easily the best of the Harry Potter films to date, and it not only serves as a nice prequel for the series as a whole but shows us how wizards live outside of England, and gives us new insights into the wizarding-world culture.

""Fantastic Beasts"" follows Newt Scamander, a British wizard arriving in 1920s New York City on an important errand.  Newt has a fascination with magical creatures, and even carries an enchanted briefcase that serves as a gateway to a ""pocket world"" full of them... which results in mayhem when he accidentally switches suitcases with Jacob, an ordinary human who just wants to find the funding to open his own bakery.  When Jacob accidentally releases some of Newt's creatures into New York City's non-magical populace, Newt sets off on a quest to hunt them down... a quest that has him running afoul of a former Auror named Tina, who believes one of Newt's creatures is responsible for wreaking magical havoc throughout the city.  What starts off as a quest to recover his creatures turns into a battle to save the wizards of the United States from being exposed -- and stop a fearsome creature from killing innocent humans and wizards alike -- before a corrupt wizard-government official can use the chaos to further his own agenda...

While this film shares some characters and concepts in common with the rest of the Harry Potter series, as a whole it's an original story.  And as a result, I enjoyed it much more than the rest of the Harry Potter films.  It was nice to be able to watch a film that played in the same universe without triggering my urge to nitpick it to death, and fascinating to have a film that explored stories outside the established books and films, as well as explored time periods and locations not covered by the books.  I loved seeing how the culture and government of the American wizarding world differed from the British, from the policies regarding Muggles (called No-Majs in the US) to even how American wizards tend to handle their wands.  One might expect a film based on a Harry Potter nature guide to be a ""documentary"" of sorts, but here they've managed to weave a compelling tale but still incorporate many of the creatures of the book inside (as well as add some new ones!)

The acting is well-done as well -- Eddie Redmayne is adorable as Newt Scamander.  We're given a whole new world of characters to get to know and love, and as much as Harry Potter fans love Harry, Ron, and Hermione, I loved the dynamics and character development we got with Newt, Jacob, Tina, and Queenie as well.  Also, there are some enjoyable cameos by Ron Perlman and Johnny Depp within this film, though I won't spoil who they play...

The special effects are spectacular, preserving the enchantment and wonder of the magic of Harry Potter without breaking the audiences suspension of disbelief.  The creatures themselves are fantastically rendered, and look believable and well-designed enough to not look goofy to the audience.  The entire look of the film evokes its time period and location but still pleases the eye with some fascinating locations and designs.

Probably the best Harry Potter films to date, this is a must-see if you're a fan of the series, and still an enjoyable adventure if you're only a casual fan or even if you're unfamiliar with the books (some familiarity with the series does help, but isn't entirely necessary).  I have high hopes for the sequel, and hope to continue to see more of these characters.",1497657600,,4462,4.607323232323233

The actors in the movie did an exceptional job and the plot kept you guessing until the very end.  For die hard Potterheads, this movie is a must see as your Harry Potter knowledge may give you a hint at some of the things to come.

4559274,5,B00543R3WG,"**This review is for the version I purchased; the one that looks like the photo I included**

The discs appear to be region-free. They're a UK/Ireland release, but they play perfectly fine on my North American Xbox One console, and I see no mention of region anywhere on the box. You get a Blu Ray disc for each film and a Blu Ray disc for each part of a ""making of"" documentary for the series. I haven't watched these yet, but they're there if that's your thing. The packaging itself isn't super high quality- just shiny cardboard sleeve/envelope things, but I don't care so much about that. If you have kids who are rough with disc packaging, just be aware of this.

Now, as for the digital copy. This is a UK/Ireland release and the code will only work in those regions. HOWEVER, if you email WB's digital copy support ( wbdigitalcopysupport@warnerbros.com ) they will open a support ticket with Flixster for you. If you send Flixster a photo of the Blu Ray case (showing the UV logo,) and a copy of your receipt, they will add the digital copies to your account. It took a couple days for them to reply to me, but they've been added successfully. To be clear, I live in the US.

Overall, this is an amazing price for what you get (around $45 when I bought it) especially for this series (always expensive, likely will never be available for streaming via Netflix etc.) If you're willing to put in a little legwork for the digital copies, it's worth it for sure. The discs are good quality as well. It's great watching these films in Blu Ray level HD.",1497139200,20,1554,4.464788732394366

4559277,5,B00543R3WG,"I ordered the 16 Blu-ray disc set which is supposed to include a redemption code for the UV version earlier this week and received the set on Friday. As I anticipated based on the editorial comments and other customer reviews and comments on this item, the sheet with the redemption code indicated that it was only valid in the U.K. I then sent an email to wbdigitalcopysupport@warnerbros.com, as suggested by another customer, asking if it was possible to get a code valid in the US, as the official item description doesn't make clear that the code will only be for the U.K. I received a response from Flixster Video (uvsupport@warnerbros.com, so I think you could just send your email to that address) indicating that they would be happy to add the video to my collection if I sent them a photocopy of my sales receipt (I sent a PDF of my Amazon order that I downloaded directly from Amazon) and a photo of the redemption insert that came with the set. Prior to sending the email, I didn't have a Flixster account nor did I have a UV account. Flixster must have started an account for me, and after I sent the requested information they sent me an email saying I didn't have a UV account linked to my Flixster account. I had to reset my password in order to access the Flixster account, and then I set up a UV account using the instructions they provided. Once I did that, I sent them an email indicating that I now had a UV account linked to my Flixster account, and an hour or two later I received an email telling me that they had added the UV set to my collection! I verified that it was there, and also linked my Vudu account to my UV account, and have also verified that I can watch the set via Vudu on my Roku player.

I have yet to watch any of the set, since I just got it, but I can certainly say that the Flixster/Warner Bros. folks were fantastic in assisting me in getting access to the UV version. The 16-disc set comes in beautiful yet compact packaging, and I'm confident that I'll enjoy it thoroughly!",1497139200,14,2021,4.375

4559331,2,B00543R3WG,"I liked the characters, but they all seemed to mumble their lines for the entire movie - esp Redmayne, who was barely intelligible. Hated all the dark/night scenes, too hard to see. Lots of CGI if you like that, but far too long for our taste as it rambled at the end. Plot was disjointed and confusing - a child the bad guy is looking for...but why, exactly? Chasing of beasts entertaining  and at times charming, esp the 'zoo' aspect of it in the wizard's bag. The 'dark energy' at the end didn't fit with rest of plot to me; would rather have had a major plot point with the actual BEASTS. Overall rating is ""meh"" - could've skipped it.

I liked how they showed magic and how the magic laws in the US are different than in the UK. Mostly I enjoyed the fact that Newt character was coded as autistic. He doesn't look people in the eyes and is socially awkward. I liked that him being autistic wasn't inherently bad, in fact this movie showed it as a great quality. I hope in the sequels he is still coded with autism. It's rare to see a hero with autism that isn't some super genius or just very cold and mean. The biggest problem for me is that the only black woman in this movie is pretty cut-throat. She immediately jumps to conclusions and overall is made out to be a jerk.

Before, I always had to get my parents permission (Mostly my dad's) to rent it before, but now I can just plug it into my PS3 or my Laptop whenever I want! I love this feeling and this series also got me through some hard times. I'm so sad that my generation (kids that are 10 and younger) will only know Daniel Radcliffe from Orphan in Black and Emma Watson from Beauty and the Beast, but they will always be Harry and Hermione in my heart. I hope some kids that grow up in the years of 2030 or later will learn about these movies and watch them too.",1496275200,,1019,4.0

Too many ""main characters"". Poor script, probably poor editing. Felt no connection to any character. Felt no character development whatsoever... except when characters changed opinions about others it happened suddenly, like one minute they thought another character was bad, then very suddenly they changed their mind with little evidence how they got from A to B.",1496102400,3,763,5.47457627118644

4559531,5,B00543R3WG,"I love that this movie really has nothing to do with the Harry Potter series, besides the occasional mentions of Grindelwald. We all saw what they did when they tried to expand the Harry Potter movie into a play, and they murdered it (not in a good way, if that's not clear). This is good, it's fresh and fun and cool and visually stunning....a good antidote for those of us who still cling on to our Harry Potter nostalgia.

This is quite a dark movie, not really for young kids as with the later Harry Potter films. Do not be deceived by the cute creatures and light-heated trailers. I like that about the franchise though, that it's this magical world and it's so wonderful but so dark. I loved their take on the American wizarding world in this movie, very interesting. I would absolutely love to see the American wizarding school and the other countries as well, this is definitely something I hope they continue developing. I didn't know who most of the actors were besides Colin Farrell, but I loved all of them. This is a very cohesive movie with a script that makes sense, I wish that darn Harry Potter play was developed by these people instead.",1495670400,,1155,4.526315789473684

The 1920s-1940s were a very formative period for our current world. No TVs, few cars, all news was done via newspaper or radio... it's a completely different setting than Harry Potter was. A lot of great and terrible things occurred during this time period that transformed the world forever. It is interesting to see the magical community operating during that time period, and changing along with it. It will be interesting to see how it plays out, especially if the next movies start to incorporate the depression and the second world war.",1495670400,,713,4.95

When my friends (who are die-hard Harry Potter fans) found out that I had it, all got together for an entire weekend to marathon the entire HP series, with this being first because we wanted to watch the movies in chronological order.

4559576,5,B00543R3WG,"If you are a fan of the Potter world then you will likely love this new and slightly different dip into that world that you want to know more about. If, on the other hand, you thought Harry and crew was bit not as amazing as your friends said then you won't like this one. I am in the first group, I thought there was too little of the world with only seven books and I look forward to many more forays into the world my Rowling has created.
Not having a book to judge the content on was probably a plus for this, there are no preconceived notions of the characters going into this which benefits most of them. The American wizards are a bit to worried about being cautious but at the same time a bit more creepy than the old English variety.
I wasn't as taken with the main character as I was some of the supporting characters, they saved the show in my opinion. The baker-want-to-be muggle (I'm not using No-mage as that is dumb) is there for comic relief and a great character that gets better as the movie progresses. The American gal assigned to his ""case"" is a much weaker character than her flighty sister who steals many of the scenes she is in.
The assortment of pets are as fun as they are distracting and for the most part poorly used.
I realize that I have used way more negative words than I meant to but I am such a large fan of the movies that I have become critical but I don't think my admiration for the world and the stories could be tainted in a way I wouldn't love it.",1495497600,8,1489,4.155709342560554
4559577,4,B00543R3WG,"Fun movie!  I very much enjoyed getting back into the Harry Potter world with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.  The beasts were so fun to see, especially the niffler, and for me, Jacob and Queenie stole the show.  I didn't realize that the actress who plays Queenie is the lead singer from A Fine Frenzy!  That was a fun little fact to find out.

Some parts were a little slow for me, especially the scenes with Credence, but I loved the movie and am excited for the next ones.

The characters are delightful, Eddie Redmayne played his role exceptionally well, I was equally delighted with Katherine Watersons as Porpetina, however Alison Sudol was incredibly sexy as Queenie Goldstein, especially with Red hair, wow, what a knock out, Colin Farrell was exceptional as always and Johnny Depp'd role as the central bad guy was so short, yet did all it needed to do.

Rowling wrote a book & movie so devoid of not caring in the least or sympathizing with any of these annoying characters nor what happens to them.  Eddie Redmayne, a very capable actor, plays Newt (shades of Aliens!) Scamander as incredibly & unnecessarily stupid and it doesn't work.

None of the characters have a feeling they are attempting to control their destinies, unlike Harry Potter, but rather are victims of it.  I was highly disappointed by the lack of intelligence here, opting for excessively silly instead.  Visual Effects alone as well do not a movie make.  This movie is for the Harry Potter desperate looking for more magic but ultimately finding little.  Next time Jo give us characters we can care about.

4559692,4,B00543R3WG,Love the movie but find it odd that the only way to get it to play in 3D is by using the 2D to 3D upscaling method. For some reason this movie does not appear to have a true 3D disc even though it claims to be one. This may be an issue with my 3D player but I had the same issue with both a Samsung BluRay and PS4. I will not mark it down as I love the movie and it does provide 3D but thought it is worth mentioning in case anyone else is having this issue.,1494892800,,458,3.59

When I opened it up to play I found that the blu ray disc never had a label applied, so it looks just like a blank silver disc on both sides. Luckily, the blu ray plays and functions normally. It would be nice to have a fully labeled disc for my collection though.  Not sure if anyone else has had this issue. #mildlyinteresting #mildlyannoying",1494892800,,498,4.413043478260869

4559712,3,B00543R3WG,"Potter geeks (and I'll admit to being one as much as anyone who discovered the books as an adult might be) will love this as an extension of the franchise, but it may be incomprehensible to anyone new to the wizarding world. It's a fun romp, relentlessly internally referential, and interesting in its translation of the Potter universe into a period piece of early 20th century American cliches.
But much of the movie plays to the Pottermore faithful, and I can't imagine anyone else discovering this movie and getting hooked on the story line. (Well, peripheral movies seem to work for Star Wars, so who am I to quibble? ) But I did hope that this movie would introduce characters I could love as much as the Hogwarts crew. At least for me, I miss the kids and the endearingly quirky, thoughtful or tragic adults who surrounded Harry. Here, the characters just seem awkward and a little bit lost. Still I know true Potter fans will appreciate it for what it is--more wizards!",1494892800,2,977,4.6531791907514455
4559713,5,B00543R3WG,"I love this movie!

His love interest wasn't very likable. The creatures didn't get much screen time. The villain wasn't particularly compelling or poignant. It was a mediocre wash.",1494633600,2,320,5.173076923076923

It absolutely did, it's amazing, I love the characters, and it was quite funny. I hope that the future movies in the series follows Newt, Jacob, Queenie, and Tina. I don't care for the Grindlewald and Dumbledore focus as many think the new ones will be. I want to know more about these wonderful characters they just introduced.",1494633600,,472,4.436781609195402

In this case though I found myself ""leaving the movie"" and questioning--how did they get Redmayne to walk like that, was it something attached to his leg or ...Anyway, bad sign.

It actually looked like a bootleg.  I had my stereo system at a level I've never had it, because it would be too loud, yet I was just able to hear it.  When I tried to request a refund, it said that it was not eligible for one.  I just blew my money on this.  I've never had an issue with buying videos before through Amazon but I will no longer do so, for fear of it being a bootleg and I can't even get my money back.  Do not purchase this item, if you read the reviews like I SHOULD have, there are others leaving similar comments.

4559873,5,B00543R3WG,"Everyone loves VR, and everyone says 3D was a stupid fad that never took off. Maybe that's true, and maybe that's because studios didn't produce the right kind of effects in most movies. I'm not a huge Potter fan (my wife is, so I bought this for her - and then she made me watch it) but I did listen to the books on Audible, and could not get into any of the movies. Perhaps because I'm doing this as an adult, and alongside reading the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. This movie, though, was good-hearted fun. Easy twist to see through regarding the Big Bad, but it was a nice movie and the 3D effects on our home TV were excellent. Any Potter fan will love it.",1494374400,3,666,4.170542635658915

The way he would sometimes look at the other characters out of the corner of his eye; this was just spot on with the character to me. This story has a great plot as well, and surprisingly had me laughing at times. Great ending, definitely leaves it open for a squeal. If you like Harry Potter, you won't be disappointed.",1494288000,,440,4.444444444444445

4559926,1,B00543R3WG,I bought this for my daughter and family who are huge Harry Potter fans and they were totally disappointed in this movie and did not even finish watching it.,1494201600,,157,4.448275862068965
4559927,5,B00543R3WG,"My 14 year old daughter was thrilled to get this for her bday. The price is right and with Prime it was here fast.

4559938,2,B00543R3WG,The movie was terribly long with hardly any action nor suspense until close to the end of the movie. There was a disconnect and lack of chemistry from the characters. There are lots of amazing talents in the movie but just lack character development for the audience to feel a connection with characters. Without that it is hard the audience for feel emotions along with the characters.,1494201600,,386,4.776119402985074
4559939,5,B00543R3WG,Love it. I  watch it at least once a week. Very well done. Goes great with The Harry Potter movies.,1494201600,,99,3.95
4559940,4,B00543R3WG,"I'm a sucker for anything related to Harry Potter, I got each one of the books as they came out when I was a kid. So, of course I had to watch this film. I enjoyed it, but mostly because it expanded on the Harry Potter universe. If it weren't tied to that, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much. Everything about the plot felt predictable, nothing in the story felt new or unique, although there definitely points that had me smiling. I mostly liked seeing the American wizarding world and the graphics were great.",1494201600,,521,4.326530612244898

4559942,5,B00543R3WG,My kids are old enough to get some of the lessons to be learned from this movie besides just enjoying the beautifully created beasts and very creative storyline. I have loved all the Harry Potter series and am very pleased with this one.,1494201600,,237,4.534883720930233
4559943,5,B00543R3WG,As a Harry Potter fan of course I needed to see this flic. I was pleasantly surprised. No Harry mentioned as the plot was before Harry. The flic had excellent special effects and the acting was great. I found it amusing and entertaining. A fun flic to sit down with the family on a Friday night.,1494201600,,295,4.285714285714286

4559952,2,B00543R3WG,"oh, I mean, magical creatures. The good vs. evil spirit of the Harry Potter series sinks to a political-social level and loses its engaging personal power and timeless magic. The characters are such stereotypes, it's impossible to really care about them, and what happens to them, because they come off as psychiatric case studies as opposed to living breathing souls. A really dark movie, and not just visually. Depressing, really, despite the occasional laughs by creatures that weren't really all that cute or endearing. At this point, I have to ask myself, what's the point? This felt like it was all happening in JK Rowling's head more than her heart and soul and did not feel real, and, in this case, I'm glad it isn't.",1494115200,,725,4.808
4559953,2,B00543R3WG,"I love the world of Harry Potter and Rowling came up with some pretty fantastic magical animals - unfortunately these stellar creatures were not enough to carry the whole story. The story plot was a little thin and quite frankly a little too macabre for my liking. I would have enjoyed the plot if it was just about the young gent rounding up his suitcase of magical beasts, the sub-plot of the dark force was just too odd and gloomy. Not a feel good movie. I enjoy escapism, but to lovely magical places, not morbid. Waited a long time for this movie and was sorely disappointed. Don't waste your money.",1494115200,,604,4.5
4559954,5,B00543R3WG,"I loved this movie, all the fantastic beasts were amazing and I like how Newt handles them, a lot like Hagrid thinking they aren't dangerous.  The nifflers were great, hold them upside down and shake and watch all the shiny stuff fall out.  Anyone else notice the Deathly Hallows pendant left behind, wonder if it is the one Luna Lovegood's father wears to the wedding.",1494115200,,369,4.661538461538462

4559961,1,B00543R3WG,Nope. Falls short of the rest of the Harry Potter series. I was bored after the first 15 minutes. ,1494115200,2,98,4.157894736842105

The characters were great and the story was interesting. I also loved the idea of seeing more of the magical beasts from Harry Potter and getting more of a background on the Harry Potter world.

A great movie for all ages. It really was worth the rental price.",1494028800,,422,4.023809523809524

And the first Quiddich joke soars past most of the audience.
Just as the appearance of the Deathly Hallows symbol gives away who Gellert Grindelwald is in a flash.

There is SO much that appears to be written just for insiders and long time fans.
Oh, it's a great story for the muggles, but wizarding folk will GET it.",1494028800,5,359,4.264705882352941
4559971,4,B00543R3WG,"This was a great family movie, but not all of it was understandable. The main character was fun and lovable. There was an amusing romance, and the scene at the end is hilarious. But though we have a bunch of ""fantastic beasts,""  it doesn't have the same creativity or wildness of the world of Harry Potter. This does not take place at Hogwarts, but in the USA. It's in the 1920s-1930s, and I like the setting, with all the clothes and cars and carriages, but it's always raining and dreary. There was one just plain weird scene where you're completely lost. The only creative things I saw were fantastic beasts and the suitcase. I love how this is linked to the book Harry is supposed to get. The movie was great, but if only it would have not had that scene, had more whimsical-ness, and was more clear.",1494028800,,804,4.4324324324324325

4559973,5,B00543R3WG,This movie had some of the best graphics that I have ever seen. I loved it on the big screen and therefore felt that I had to have it as part of my private library. Loved Harry Potter so a series of prequels is a must.,1493942400,,218,3.760869565217391

4559975,5,B00543R3WG,"A truly wonderful story, populated with adult wizards (spells work first time, no backfiring wands, no obvious effort in doing all this). Most of the characters are people I would like to know. Plus fantastical beasts, many of whom seem to have populated our dreams as children. Wonderful acting, too. I've seen it 4 times now, mostly showing it to friends. Always find new things, or have a different take on characters and events.",1493942400,,432,4.851351351351352

4559977,3,B00543R3WG,"This is not a children's movie. It is very dark - a repressive, fascist wizarding world as if Mussolini was running it or possibly Sen. Joe McCarthy, complete with thugs in leather coats, carrying wands like guns and executions for minor infractions of the secrecy rules. It was OK, but more like the later Harry Potter books, which I felt were too upsetting for children who loved the first one, when Harry was a little boy. There aren't many actual children in this movie. It's more about grownups gone astray and those who oppose them. Also, it was filmed very darkly. Dark streets, dark rooms, pasty-faced people. Not recommended for small children in my view.",1493942400,2,664,4.782608695652174

It attempts to fill in the Wizadry world of the 1930s when the magical world had to deal with racism, paranoia and also has an underlying theme of protection of magical creatures. Give it a chance by watching it twice and then decide. I had already read the script which helped. Overall acting is good.",1493856000,2,427,4.35

4560009,5,B00543R3WG,"I never really fell into the fandom or the hype of the Harry Potter books/movies, so I was a bit hesitant to check out Fantastic Beasts but being it had completely different characters, in a completely new location I thought I'd give it a go.  I quite liked it, the beasts are the highlight of the film, they are as the title suggest fantastic looking creatures, the plot which to be frank is a pretty basic one, certainly takes a backstory to we the viewer seeing these really cool creatures on the screen.  I actually got the most enjoyment amongst all the human/wizard characters from the socially awkward obese guy who wanted a bank loan to start a bakery.  I think he carried the film more so than the rest of the supporting cast.  I found the police woman or whatever she was to be quite weak and uninteresting.  Newt the main character, the author of the book titled the same name as this movie in the Harry Potter timeline, was good but you can't help but think you've seen his character a million times before in countless movies. But the movie is basically him collecting the beasts he smuggled through US customs that escaped his briefcase so it does fit.

At times though you couldn't help but compare what was happening on the screen to other movies, such as Ghostbusters, with the trap from that movie simply being replaced by a briefcase. The Men In Black memory wiping for humans. The Emperor with the electricity flowing from his hands in Return of the Jedi scene hurting Luke was looking like it was going to happen in this film too, I was just wondering who was going to be Vader and pick the villain guy up over his head. This definitely isn't a fresh new ideas film, but I did like it.  Four and a half stars.",1493856000,,1730,4.438485804416404

Some of my friends criticize the plot.  I think the message it sends is critical - basically - don't abuse kids, cherish them, cuz trauma is real and really bad for everybody involved as well as society at large.

4560031,5,B00543R3WG,This was a fantastic movie. Ms Rowlings outdid herself with the story. Harry Potter for adults. Who'd a thunk,1493769600,,109,4.7894736842105265

4560036,5,B00543R3WG,Fantastic Beasts and where to find them is a great addition to the Harry Potter universe.  The foursome in this story have great chemistry and I'm looking forward to seeing more of the story. The only complaint I have is I just wish the digital copy was iTunes instead of ultra violet.,1493769600,,285,4.480769230769231

4560041,4,B00543R3WG,Love the movie. Very disappointed in that I could not get the Ultraviolet to work so I could have it on my iPad and iPhone!  I even opened an account with Ultraviolet still didn't work. This is the second movie I have purchased with ZUltraviolet that wouldn't work.,1493769600,,265,4.520833333333333

4560043,5,B00543R3WG,Purchased this Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection (Blu-ray +DVD)  as a gift for my wife. She is a HUGE Potter fan and she LOVED this set. I did notice that back of the package we received had the UV Digital expiration date 03/04/16. I was worried that it might be old. But as amazon states that it has been extended. I was able to use that expired code on my ultraviolet account and added all the movies without a problem.,1493769600,,420,4.3164556962025316

4560046,4,B00543R3WG,"Interesting prequel with highly likeable characters and fantastic CGI.  I was concerned at the beginning of the film that the creatures were all going to look like muffets, but the quality of the creatures seemed to improved the story progressed.  Maybe due to the creatures getting larger.... Some of the best scenes were when Newt went into the suitcase and you saw all the wonderful creatures he had.",1493683200,,403,4.911764705882353
4560047,1,B00543R3WG,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is all special effects and no plot. Every moment of this movie is filled with special effects and it is so heavy laden that it's exhausting. Even the simple art of making tea was made with a spell. Yawn. There is so little plot that for 1/2 of the movie the protagonist is chasing a little thieving duckbilled gerbil around NYC. It gets old real fast. In the 2011 film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part ll, there is a white dragon that is breathtakingly illustrated and brought to life. Contrarily, the modeling of the beasts and insects in Fantastic Beasts are hastily rendered, looking more like Play-Doh in rainbow colors... and you thought Jar Jar Binks was annoying.",1493683200,3,720,4.677165354330708
4560048,5,B00543R3WG,"I love this movie!! I'm a huge Harry Potter fan (books and movies), and I love Fantastic Beasts just as much in its own right. It comes at the wizarding world from a different direction than the HP books/movies in that rather than watching kids grow up and learn magic, this is the adult world of magic, where everyone is competent already, and where people can disapparate and apparate at will. It makes it very fun to watch. I also love how incredibly charming these characters are! The actors in this do an amazing job of conveying that! Can't wait for the next movie to come out!",1493683200,,583,4.457943925233645

4560059,1,B00543R3WG,"I don't often turn off a movie. But this was sooo boring. It was like a chance for the producers to hang the Harry Potter name on something, and show a bunch of special effects.

4560063,2,B00543R3WG,"I really didn't like this movie. I loved the Harry Potter movies, but this one was excruciating to watch. Eddie Redmayne was not meant for these movies. That hang dog look of his and slump shouldered manner is just irritating. Dan Fogler played the best part in the movie. The only thing that made the movie worth watching was the final scene with the bird.",1493683200,,357,4.507692307692308

4560066,2,B00543R3WG,"Coming from all the Harry potter movies, I had high expectations.  Unfortunately this movie is a let down.
I assume it is mainly a fanfare movie for people who have read the associated book?

-SPOILERS: -
My main problem is that there is no character development, or at least any you care about.  When the movie ended I couldn't even remember the main characters name... You end up only having cared about the human and witch girl relationship.
-You only see the main bad guy do anything at the very beginning and end, like he's just a side thing.
-The entire movie was them trying to collect the ""beasts"" he brought with him and accidentally released, while feeling like the movies only goal was to try and impress you with the animals themselves... But all the ""Animals"" they had to collect just felt like filler and not really interesting or important.

In the end I came out of it feeling like the movies only purpose was to show off a bunch of ""cool animals"" that people who read the book might want to see animated.  Everything else about it was lackluster.",1493683200,,1063,4.544502617801047

4560159,4,B00543R3WG,"I didn't realize that this was related to the Harry Potter world until I started watching this.  Although I wouldnt say that I am a huge HP fan, I did enjoy watching most of the movies of that series, especially after the first couple of movies.  So, if you are a HP fan, then this is a movie you will enjoy but I think that even if you are not a HP fan, I think this is an enjoyable fantasy movie.

As the title of the movie says, the special effects and CGI are pretty fantastic.  There are some pretty amazing CGI details even down the smallest background piece or fantastic creature.

The acting for the most part is good, although there are a few scenes where you can tell the actors are a little confused with the green screen and the scenes look a bit strange due to their reactions but for the most part, I found it a minor issue.  The stars of the movie, to me, are the trouble making beasts, especially the smaller ones.

The story is pretty good and something different from the typical HP type of story, although there are times the plot seems to want to go in a variety of directions at once.  There are a few moments that try to lighten the mood as the movie gets a bit dark at times.  Sometimes those light moments are cute and sometimes they are rather bland and silly.  The movie is a bit long at 2 hours and 15 minutes.  I do think they stretched the ending out a bit and it could have been cut a bit shorter.  Of course, like most movies that are popular these days, they are setting up for a sequel.

Overall, a decent HP spinoff that both HP fans and fantasy fans, like I am, will enjoy.

4 stars",1493424000,,1617,4.141025641025641

Even though I miss seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione...I'm sure I will come to love the characters in this series. It's awesome that they intend to make 6 movies in this new franchise and I can't wait until they release the next one.

4560269,2,B00543R3WG,"I honestly don't understand all the positive reviews.  Okay, some of the special effects were cool.  But the best part of the movie was the character of Jacob Kowalski.  There was no background whatsoever about the other characters.  Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Stephen Hawking, but he just didn't do well in this movie.  He always has this somewhat dumbfounded look on his face and this awkward smile, even when something horrible is happening.  I'm not sure if that's how he talks in real life or what.  But it was annoying and creepy.  You just wanted to slap him in order for him to show some anger or any other emotion whatsoever!  I think people want to like this because it's from JK Rowling, but if anyone else wrote this, I think people would be more negative.  Just because it has her name stamped on it doesn't mean it's good. Collin Farrell was just okay, he's less annoying to watch than Eddie, but the cameo at the end with Johnny Depp didn't add anything to the movie. You could have paid a random actor a lot less money to do a better job for 10 seconds of acting.  Blah, definitely not worth all the hype. JK Rowling should make a GOOD movie about magic in America.  She could have elaborated on the school and shown us more.  Like Harry Potter but in America - this was not it!",1493078400,2,1297,4.399159663865547

It strikes me as more grown up than the Potter films since it does not focus on the lives of children and teenagers. As an animal lover myself, I totally identify with Eddie Redmayne's character and his dedication to the safety of his creatures.

My husband thought it was inane.  Newt Scamander was well played, the visuals were okay, old New York scenes were good but the plot was just 'off'.  That business of hopping into the suitcase and finding living creatures and their habitats in an area the size of a small  state was too much for me.  Yes, I know Moody's trunk had seven layers and Hermione carried books, clothes and supplies in her evening bag.  Don't care, this went too far.  The neffler was a cute platypus type animal, rather endearing as it raided jewelry stores and the other creatures were interesting.  I just did not like to story because the story was not really there.  With the Potter movies, we had the books for explanation and enrichment.  There was very little development.  Gellert  Grynedwald (sp?) made an appearance.  The president of the New York, or maybe US wizards said, when he was finally  captured, that he would be securely locked away.  Well pardon me, but Potter fans know, Gryndewald must have escaped because Albus Dumbledore defeated him in combat in 1945.",1492992000,,1216,4.63849765258216

4560343,3,B00543R3WG,"Part of the Potterworld franchise, I enjoyed this trip back in time to 1920's Gotham city like New York, to follow the adventures of Magizologist Newt Scamander and the origin's of the Hogwarts text book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.  The star of the movie is really all the fantastic magical creatures, contained in Newt Scamander's Narnia like suit case. The Occamys, Thunderbirds, Demiguises, the fabulous Swooping Evil, and the most adorable Nifflers and Boat Truckles let loose over New York. And it made a change from the original series to see a glimpse of the wizarding world in America. It is charming but has a dark Crucible like undertones with the Witch Hunters. All the performances were very good and the script said to be written by JK Rowling was excellent. Many people enjoyed the comic romance and chemistry of No-Mag Jacob, and Queenie -  it's the only thing I really didn't like in the movie. I just found their odd coupling, hot young sex bomb and a rather rotundly fat puggy faced middle aged baker, not at all believable. It's  was like pairing Brad Pitt with Kathy Burke!

That said, I give this a thumbs up for a non-Harry Potter film. The theme was not as dark as the Harry Potter films became and the characters were enjoyable and well played. I will watch it again and look more carefully this time to get more into the film. I hope for a sequel but the film manages to stand on it's own so I don't know if a sequel is in the works but I hope so.  The underpinnings for such a movie are there at the end of the film.

4560396,5,B00543R3WG,"I loved this. Eddie Redmayne is absolutely perfect for Newt Scamander. It is a take it or leave it movie. You can't be disappointed in this because there's legitimately no story/character framework to reference when you watch this. You literally are seeing this from the ground up as far as the story  creation goes. It's definitely different because its 1920s, American wizardry, Pre-Harry Potter magic and characters. You get brief glimpses of romance and comedy in this dark and dramatic movie. The niffler is probably one of my favorite comedic characters in this.

The acting is carried out superbly. I loved this that I pre-ordered it as soon as it was available.",1492646400,3,669,4.964285714285714

4560401,5,B00543R3WG,"It's 1926, the Jazz Age before the Great Depression and New York City is hopping in more ways than one. In Europe, Gellert Grindewald, a dark wizard still on the run, has spread terror with his attacks on Muggles. He wants to start a war between Muggles and magicians.

As in Europe, the NYC population of No-Majs (No-Magic, the American term for Muggles) have only suspicions that there are magicians among them. To keep it that way, the American wizarding community has strict laws, enforced by MACUSA, including a ban on magical beast ownership in the U.S.

Enter Newt Scamader. Literally. He disembarks a ship in New York Harbor with a small suitcase and it soon becomes apparent that he is not only holding magical beasts in his suitcase but those beasts are prone to escaping.

But is it Newt's fault that a horrific gray cloud is descending on NYC streets to kill people and destroy buildings? MACUSA thinks so. The truth is MUCH more interesting.

I think ""Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great addition to PotterWorld. The first time I watched it, I thought it was good though a little slow sometimes. The 2nd time, because I knew the story, I was able to pay more attention to detail and production values. Now I think it is a very good movie. In particular, it is a lot of fun to pay attention not just to the main action, but the background, and find hints of the Harry Potter world in the original films. One of those, incidentally, is NOT Leta Lestrange. We know the Lestrange last name of old, but Leta did not appear on the original family tree in ""The Order of the Phoenix.""

If you watch the movie on BluRay/DVD, you can have the options of audio in English Descriptive Video, French or Spanish. You can also watch with subtitles in English, French or Spanish.

I enjoyed the Special Features on the BluRay/DVD release. They have interviews, film clips and rehearsal clips with a total of some 32 people commenting. The only audio on the Special Features is English. But they have subtitles available in English, French, and 3 more languages which I'm not sure of because they are not shown in English letters.
....A...""Before Harry Potter: A New Era of Magic Begins"" (15 minutes) Alison Sudol (plays Queenie) says, ""Friendship is something that Jo [JK Rowling] does beautifully. It's always a very strong through-line in all of her stories.""
....B...""Characters: The Magizoologist, Goldstein Sisters, No-Maj Baker, New Salemers, and The Presidennt and the Auror"" (total 23 minutes) Hear from writers, crew and the cast. Eddie Redmayne (plays Newt) talks about developing his character, ""I went about it by meeting people from the zoologist world, meeting trackers. They would talk passionately about their techniques and their methods."" This was particularly helpful in the hilarious scenes with the Erumpent.
Dan Fogler talks about Jacob and Queenie, ""There are strict laws, especially in New York, that we're not allowed to be together, which also mirrors the racism of the time. It's really beautiful how J.K. parallels all of these cultural conundrums.""
Last, but not least, J.K. Rowling, ""This is the back story [of the Barbones] you don't learn in the movie."" Watch this bonus to find out.
....C...""Creatures: Meet the Fantastic Beasts, Bowtruckle, Demiguise, Erumpent, Niffler, Occamy and Thunderbird"" (total 20 minutes) This includes lots of interesting  shots with the puppeteers doing their own magic.
JK Rowling, ""You can make an invisibility cloak from the pelt of a Demiguise. Which is why they're hunted and endangered.""
....D...""Design: Shaping the World of Fantastic Creatures, New York City, MACUSA, Newt's Magical Case, The Shaw Banquet and The Blind Pig"" (total 32 minutes)
David Heyman (producer): ""We visited New York [City] and did a scout there. There is remarkably little of New Yok 1926 in New York today."" So they created it at Warner Brothers Leavesden back lot in 15 weeks. Most movies would only dream that they had enough money to do that.
David Watkins (special effects supervisor) shares great footage of how they filmed the Obscurus damage at the Shaw Banquet.
....E...""Deleted Scenes"" (total 14 minutes) There are 5 scenes. The character of Mildred was totally deleted and I think the film is better for it.

The funniest and most open-minded baker in the world: ""I don't think I'm dreaming. I don't got the brains to make this up.""

I'm looking forward to the next Newt Scamander installment. It sounds like there will be at least 3 movies total. For one thing, we'll learn more about the  best wizarding school in the U.S., Ilvermorny in Massachusetts. The houses are the Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird and Pukwudgie. Check out pottermore(dot)com for JK Rowling's story of the school.

4560435,3,B00543R3WG,"JK Rowling's new Harry Potter world-extension isn't so much a prequel as it is a loose, distantly relevant novella. People wave wands and use familiar lingo. Footnotes from the wizarding world take flesh and form out in the wild and there's a bit of familiar name-dropping to keep us all invested. Eddie Redmayne takes top billing as the introverted naturalist with an extensive collection of traveling wildlife, but as the name implies, the beasts themselves are the real stars here. A live-action jaunt through the monster manual, it's an interesting, unusual turn if not a terribly fulfilling one. Many times, I felt like I was digging through the guts of an info-rich companion book and not a free-standing tale. There's the framework of a story, of course, but it's awfully dry, light fare and the real focus is quite clearly on establishing a deeper lore for the growth of the franchise. The effects work is strong, as it desperately needed to be, and I enjoyed the unexpected aesthetic of magical society at play in the roaring twenties, but there isn't a lot of meat on these bones. Disappointing, since the Potter films are brimming with precisely the kind of depth, warmth and rich, implied back-story that this is missing.",1492560000,,1233,4.904306220095694

It doesn't match the style (font, photos, etc.) of any of the other discs, and it's off centered. It almost looks as though someone created the label at home, printed it off and stuck it to a burned disc.

I watched this with my friend and with my 78 year old grandmother whom also loved this movie. If you've seen all the Harry Potters and if you are like me and are a fan of magic and magical creatures oh this is an awesome movie. Also I enjoyed the length of the movie as well.

I immediately tried to return & discovered it was 3 days past my 30 day window! I'd ordered other DVDs & watched them first. I should have checked the 8-disk set first! I still haven't watched the whole set but I made the mistake of reading the 'customers reviews' BIG MISTAKE!! That's another thing, don't get caught up in reading the reviews--I know, sounds counter intuitive, but trust me this subject matter (Harry Potter) is a lightening rod of opinions & dissapointments.

4560506,4,B00543R3WG,"I'll offer a two-part review here.  First, a review of the movie itself and, second, a review of the 4K UHD disk.

The Movie - 3 Stars
A solid effort here, but I feel this will fall short of the expectations that many Harry Potter fans will place upon this film.  While certainly a solid effort, Fantastic Beasts doesn't quite have the magical feel (pun intended) of the original series. Despite fans' longing for Hogwarts and the original cast of characters, there is a genuine opportunity to create something new and exciting here, especially for younger viewers that didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Overall, I will say that the studio did an impressive job recreating 1920's New York in fantastic detail.  Costumes were excellent, characters seemed true to the period, and it was a nice change of pace from Harry's modern-day Britain.

Though paced a bit slow for the first third of the movie, the latter chapters certainly do not lack for action, and I think audiences will enjoy the familiar cadence leading up to the climax.  In comparison to the original Potter series, I suppose one could say that most of those films also spent a great deal of time in the first chapters building up to the rising action.  But this is where original Potter series shines, and where this film left me wanting more.  In the original films, the early chapters spent a great deal of time constructing the rich background and wondrous characters in illustrious detail.  A mere hour into the first film, we *loved* Harry, and even us adults that waited years in tacit denial before seeing the films found ourselves rooting for him along the way.  Very few films have the power to create a connection with young people, but also transport us adults back to childhood.  The original films did just that, and it was largely due to Rowling's masterful characterization.  Kids wanted to be Harry, and adults, regardless of childhood station, found ways to identify with Harry as well.

In Fantastic Beasts, however, I largely felt like an outside observer.  I was never quite drawn into the story, and I yearned for the rich background the original films consistently provided.  I also wanted to like the characters, I truly did.  The dialogue felt a bit flat and even awkward at times, and the characters felt 2-dimensional compared to Harry and friends.  And while by no means a short movie, it all kind of felt rushed.  I will say that the reveal at the end does have me somewhat excited for the second move, so I'll reserve final judgement until we see what the future of the series has to offer.

The Disk - 5 Stars
First, some specs on the setup:

Display: LG OLED65E6P
Source:  Oppo UDP-203
Pre/Pro: Emotiva UMC-1
Amp: Sony 80 Watts/Channel
Speakers: Polk Tsi in 5.1 Configuration with Polk PSW-505 Sub

I've viewed a number of 4K UHD movies at present, and all have been beautiful.  Fantastic Beasts is no exception. The colors of 1920's New York were, though intentionally muted at times, were stunning.  This was in contrast to the rich color of Newt's magical world and his beasts, which veritably leapt from the screen.  HDR implementation was solid as well.  Though I cannot comment on Atmos (yet), the audio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was rich and enveloping.

The VUDU UHD stream in Dolby Vision was nearly as vibrant as the UHD disk, and I think all but the most discerning videophiles will be pleased with the quality of the digital copy.",1492214400,2,3431,4.722689075630252

Honestly though..was there even a plot? It was so hard to follow anything going on. I pay very close attention to detail and plot and was surprised there wasn't really one at all. I thought after the first 20minutes that the story would pick up. Nope. Not at all. I couldn't even understand Newts extremely quiet mumbling. I kept turning to my girlfriend and asking, ""what did he say??"" At least the whole time. Idk that annoyed me a lot. Overall this movie really sucked. Couldn't wait for it to be over.

From then on, he goes on a hunt to retrieve his missing beasts with a muggle named Jacob. The movie seemed to lack the charm that the Harry Potter movies had and also lacked in-depth characterization. By the end of the movie, you still didn't feel as if you truly knew the characters. The producers of this movie put more emphasis and effort on their digital work. There was a noticeable amount of effort put into the animation of the beasts, which I thought looked great. The costumes were very well done, which earned them an Oscar. In the end I left the movie pretty unsatisfied, probably since I had high expectations coming in.

I would normally, give the Potter (anything Potter) a five, but this is a total loser and there is something to be said about our money wasted and our life hours being wasted watching something that is an entertainment disappointment.

It's mostly a showcase for special effects, with long sequences dedicated purely to chasing beasts but not dealing with any story factors. A few obligatory references to the Harry Potter universe we already know is not enough to endear this film.",1491696000,,657,4.972727272727273

Very few people I know of had ever even heard of it - too bad.
Well made, well acted - not some cheap stupid remake of a comic book or the zillionth part to something started 30 years ago.
I really enjoyed it  and am looking forward to part 2. Not sure how little ones would take to it - but it's a fun film and I am so very glad it's in my collection!

Almost all of the characters are intent on doing the right thing -- they just don't know what that is. And the getting together of our 4 heros/heroines is very satisfying and not overly rushed. Realistic relationships are developing slowly, and it will be fun to find out how they turn out in a sequel. (I want to see those Appaloosa what-ya-macall-its.)

It has a different feel from Harry Potter but not to much of a difference to where you can't tell they both take place in the same universe.

Overall I think this is a great fantasy film that can be enjoyed by fans of Harry Potter and those not familiar with the wizarding world of Harry Potter as well (if you haven't seen any of the potter films that's fine as it will not ruin this movie or confuse anyone ect). I am happy to now own this film so I can watch it as many times as I'd like (I've already watched it a few times since bringing it home not even a week ago, lol) I would recommend this film to all, Harry Potter fan or not you will defiantly enjoy this jem of a movie!

4560733,3,B00543R3WG,"We rented this movie through amazon prime.  The movie is no harry potter for sure, it is in the harry potter world though.  I was not impressed with the story line.  It could have been so much better.  The visuals are amazing, cgi incredible.  But I felt that there was something missing to this film,  it felt at times rushed, and in fact there was a part that I felt was left unresolved (I won't state which so I don't spoil the movie for those who have not watched it.)  Great for renting, not a keeper.  I am so happy we rented it first instead of buying the blu ray.  To be honest the main reason there is a problem with the plot is that they push so much on the protagonist part of the movie and build on the suspense, and at the last minute what would have been supposedly a super evil gets dealt with in seconds like a fly bothering a cow and getting tail whipped from the cow's rear end like nothing, and also leaves another character's growth and importance in limbo forgotten.  Great potential, unfinished story telling.",1491350400,2,1031,4.322916666666667

Eddie Redmayne is such a versatile actor and was really charming and fun in this film.  I also really enjoyed the mind reading witch.  Very cute and funny. The rest of the characters were pretty dull.  However, the story didn't seem to be developed very well and almost appeared as if Rowling wasn't sure where she wanted to go with it.  It is somewhat darker than the original series (although they got pretty dark at the end, too).  The magical creatures, except for the Griffen, were poorly done and disappointing.

The digital copy can only be used on Flixster, CinemaNow, and Vudu.  That's it.
So if you want this on your apple device, you can only do so by buying it again.

Additionally, though it may come as no surprise to some, but the blu-ray is encrypted so that you cannot view this on your PC without going out and buying a blu-ray media player, even if you have a blu-ray drive.

On the plus side, the DVD works well...

Bottom line:  If you want to add this to your iTunes library along with owning disks as I do, good luck to you.  We'll need it.",1491177600,7,735,4.090909090909091

Why can't people write movies about the best of humanity without people torturing tormented souls and ruining everything? Clearly because that is too difficult. The best character was by far the niffler. And the niffler didn't even speak English! Or speak at all! Or even exist for most of the movie! This should really get 0 out of 5 stars. It essentially is the Eragon of the Harry Potter series. If this entire movie had been about the niffler taking all the shiny things in New York, it would maybe have been the best movie of 2016.

Having seen so many films in the format, I can confidently say that this is EASILY one of the best presentations out of my entire collection. Warner Brothers has really used the format to immerse you in the Wizarding World and make you feel like you're a part of all the action and adventure. If you've been looking for a great 3D disc to add to your collection, or have a 3D TV that you haven't quite enjoyed yet, this is a fantastic addition to your collection. My only complaint is that aside from some quick-moving newspaper headlines in the opening sequence, Grindelwald is never properly introduced - leaving anyone who hasn't read the books either recently or at all, in the dust. It's nothing a quick Google search can't fix, but I can see a lot of people feeling a bit lost by the end of the film and skipping any future sequels as a result.",1491091200,15,971,4.370165745856354

4560834,4,B00543R3WG,"My expectations were very high when I heard about this movie because, despite my advanced age, I'm a J.K. Rowling fan.
In general, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" met those expectations. It is visually stunning, has some wonderful performances (especially notable, in my opinion, are Alison Sudol as ""Queenie"" and Dan Fogler as ""Jake Kowalski""), and a likable hero in Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne.) The story is well thought out and the CGI is nothing short of amazing.
Where the film didn't meet my expectations, however, was in the direction. I felt that director David Yates lost focus a few times. Some scenes seemed overly long, for example, while in a few others he apparently fell victim to the common Hollywood failing of trying to dazzle audiences with special effects rather than letting his actors tell the story. Rowling has the ability to create memorable characters and give them plenty of rich dialogue but there were occasions in this otherwise very fine film that Yates had his actors standing around gaping at the whiz bang CGI instead of moving the story forward.
That said, I still very much enjoyed this film, the first in what I hope will be at least a trilogy. As far as I'm concerned, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is worth every bit of 4.5 stars.",1491091200,,1305,4.778761061946903

The movie misleads you, if you are expecting loads of creatures jumping out of the suit case or running wild in the city and needed to be captured. Sorry its not here.
In fact our nameless hero or the captain of a nameless subject does no such adventure finding said creatures. So thats a fail
Meaningless and unimportant characters that have little to no plot development

The main characters are uninteresting and borderline unlikable. The fanciful CGI beasts are mildly artistic, but are gratuitously crow barred into the story. The plot jumps all over the place, with characters and plotlines introduced then abandoned for long parts of the movie. Carmen Ejogo, God bless her, just can't act.

4560953,4,B00543R3WG,"J. K. Rowling has released a new story line in her famous and immersive series in the Harry Potter Universe.  Directed by Harry Potter veteran David Yates 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' features the adventures of Newt Scamander, who has traveled to New York City for unknown reasons.  Newt is played by Eddie Redmayne of 'Les Misrables fame as a lovable but wacky collector of magical beasts making his way through the unknown dangers of New York City.  Be advised, wacky hijinks await as this mesmerizing story unfolds.  Newt must control his magical beasts while avoiding the political ramifications of his mishaps in the new world and navigating the magical underground.  What awaits him on his quest full of conspiracy?  I highly recommend you discover the answer to these questions yourself.  I gave this four stars for the following reasons.  First, the product was shipped and arrived within 24 hours.  This was especially appreciated because my roommate, a crazy Harry Potter fan, was dying to see it.  Secondly, it arrived in perfect condition.  The cd case was in an artistically pleasing cover.  The shrink wrap was hard to remove, but a simple kitchen knife allowed it to be removed without damaging the insert casing.  The Blu Ray itself was immaculate.  The movie did not skip once.  Thirdly, I truly enjoyed watching this movie.  It was a well written story with a great plot line.  The actors perform with incredible talent.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because I thought it lacked good transitions between scenes.  I would definitely recommend this movie.

I was so afraid that it would be a disappointment, but I bought and watched the 3D version of this movie and I was absolutely delighted.  I normally do not get as much enjoyment from 3D movies as most people due to vision issues, but this one was incredible! I found myself laughing out loud as the creatures seemed to be touchable and right in front of my face. The move has some light-hearted context early on as you watch one particular creature get into mischief and then when one thinks a human is a potential mate. Then of course the drama develops and the ending was a surprise for me. I suppose I should have guessed where it was going but I hadn't a clue until the end.
J K Rowling did a wonderful job with this story. Harry Potter it isn't, but then it isn't intended to be.

4561005,2,B00543R3WG,"SPOILERS!! I enjoyed all the Harry Potter movies. I'm not a die-hard fan of the entire thing (I've seen them all once or twice, not 20 times, haven't read the books) but it's (Harry Potter) good entertainment. Based on that, and my mother enjoying this and wanting me to see ""for discussion"", I watched it - kind of - tonight. I was bored from the beginning. First off, why would a wizard need to take a trans-Atlantic ocean liner? Shouldn't they just be able to pop over? Second off, if this doofus of a wizard is too stupid to transport his animals in an inescapable suitcase, maybe he shouldn't be an animal caretaker. And honestly - they used the ""oops, we have the exact same suitcase and got them mixed up"" ploy? YAWN. Once his platypus or whatever, escaped - and Eddie couldn't just use his wand to snag him, I dozed off because I simply didn't care. When 1/2 the movie was over and he had his zoo under control, we could FINALLY get down to the actual story - which storyline could have been wrapped up in 15 minutes or so.

Personally, I think this movie was just supposed to be a cutesy little thing for children to enjoy - but yet, they end up killing the totally innocent boy in the end - and, had I not been watching with a Harry Potter encyclopedia fan, I wouldn't have had a clue who Griffindore or whoever he was, was. Honestly, JK Rowling has already made enough money off of this thing - this one made it seem like she's honestly doing a plain old money grab. Sad, really.

However, my group of friends gathered to watch this DVD and NONE OF US COULD UNDERSTAND HARDLY A WORD THE MAIN CHARACTER PLAYED BY EDDIE REDMAYNE SAID! Yes, he had a thick British accent, but the actor did nothing to enunciate the words clearly. He spoke softly and mumbled the words.

Frankly, after watching it half way, we began to figure out what was going on beyond the CGI but not based on anything this actor slurred together.

After watching it once, we sat there in silence and then everyone said the same thing: that the main character was appallingly bad in terms of his ability to clearly speak!

We actually watched it a second time WITH THE SUBTITLES ON and finally were able to read what this man was saying! At times we exclaimed ""THAT is what he was saying?!?!?! I never would have guessed.""  His regional UK accent was so thick that he might as well been speaking Italian.

This actor's speech was self-indulgent and tedious. Perhaps we are just uncultured Americans, but if you buy this, perhaps you should watch it with the subtitles on to save you from having to see it twice in one sitting!",1490745600,4,1250,4.533333333333333

4561047,4,B00543R3WG,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the title of a book mentioned in the novel Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and later inspired a novel by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling that Warner Brothers adapted into the newly released movie. What may appear an entirely commercial decision to milk a cash cow still further is actually a film with great charm and a wonderful menagerie of imaginative creatures.

Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a magizoologist who arrives in New York in 1926 carrying a suitcase filled with dozens of magical creatures. One of them, a Niffler  a platypus-type animal who hoards shiny things  escapes and makes its way into a bank where Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a factory worker and No-Maj (as in no magic), is applying for a loan to open his own bakery. Jacobs similar-looking suitcase containing pastries is mistakenly switched with Newts, taking the would-be baker into a series of wild and often hilarious adventures.

The big change from the Potter books is that all the characters in Fantastic Beasts are adults. Yet Rowling, who wrote the screenplay, manages to infuse the film with a whimsical sense of fun as assorted creatures run amok in the city.

The movie looks terrific, with considerable time, effort, and dollars dedicated to bringing the book to life. Theres lots of computer-generated visuals, but they are so effectively rendered that the viewer is immersed in an amazing world that combines the recognizable with the fanciful.

The creatures are great fun, with the Niffler easily the funniest and best. The look of the film expands into the New York setting, with streets, vintage cars, buildings, and landmarks suggesting the way the city must have looked in the Roaring Twenties. This differs from the approach in the Potter books, which were set primarily in a world of magic. With an actual setting, the trials of Newt take on a more grounded feel.

Mr. Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) has an Aw shucks demeanor  a combination of bashfulness and enthusiasm  that works well in his portrayal of Newt, who finds himself in a sticky situation. His odd creatures are on the loose, hes responsible for them, and yet he has to keep them a secret from regular humans. With tousled hair, a surprised expression, and a winning smile, Newt is a socially awkward young man, preferring the company of animals to his fellow wizards. Despite all the visual dazzle, Redmayne manages to keep the story focused on Newts adventures and misadventures in for him  a strange world.

Mr. Fogler has considerable screen time as hapless Jacob, whose expressions provide lots of the films chuckles. His Everyman is likable because, even though he is part of the real world, he finds himself inadvertently in a mystical swirl. As a kind of cuddly fish-out-of water, Jacob is befuddled, perplexed, and often disoriented, yet surprisingly accepting of the amazing creatures and adventures to which hes subjected.

Other characters include a magic witch named Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson), who turns Newt in to magic officials because she thinks hes acting suspiciously, and her telepathic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), who has eyes for Jacob. Colin Farrell plays Graves, autocratic head of magic enforcement, Ron Perlman is a creepy-looking speakeasy proprietor, and Jon Voight plays a newspaper mogul eager to get his son elected to Congress.

David Yates, who directed the last four Harry Potter films, easily takes the viewer back into a magic-filled world. The movie could stand a bit of trimming, but the pace is brisk and practically every frame offers something to amaze, so its two hours-plus running time isn't a major drawback.

Rated PG-13, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them combines story, performances and special effects into a winning blend that results in a thoroughly entertaining experience.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include the featurette Before Harry Potter: A New Era of Magic Begins!; close looks at the unusual critters depicted in the movie, several featurettes devoted to the films unique production design; and deleted scenes.

The purpose of my review is to point out that yet again, Warner Bros. is posting blatant lies on their packaging, claiming that you will get a digital copy and that you can ""Watch It Anywhere"" (their words).

The thing is, you can't.  It won't work in iTunes or Windows Media Player--you must download their third-party application (""Flixster"").  You also cannot even download the movie (FAQ response on their site:  ""Unfortunately, Movies All Access does not currently offer the ability to download your films."").  Therefore, to watch a digital copy, you have to install unnecessary software, agree to their terms, and then waste your bandwidth streaming the movie because you cannot download it.

What is the point?",1490659200,8,803,4.992481203007519

The level of computer animation has really brought these creatures to life, and their abilities as well. My daughter seems to share my view. She is head over heals in love with all animals at this age. I guess age doesn't matter because I really liked this one a lot! The ""Beasts"" were fantastic, but I wish we were better acquainted with all of the creatures in the movie. I was hoping to find the books, but it looks like they released what is essentially a script with a cover on it.

4561166,4,B00543R3WG,"This review can be found on my blog Crimson Blogs About Books. I watched this movie in theatres

Fantastic Beasts is set in 1926 New York, about 60 years prior to the Harry Potter series. Here we follow Newt Scamander as he travels to NY after having finished an excursion where he documented a series of magical creatures and even kept some in his suitcase. Of course, his little detour in NY becomes more of an adventure as one of his creatures escapes his case, wreaks havoc in a bank, and hes caught breaking the wizarding laws in America while the community is in a crisis of exposure!

Sounds really fun, no?

One of the more obvious reasons I wanted to watch this movie was that Id been watching all the (more recent) Harry Potter movies in theaters and this was, in a way, a Harry Potter movie, so I felt an obligation to myself to go and see this. Another was that the setting was in America. While location was never a concern for me, because magical word, who cares? just saying this was going to happen in America got me curious. Would it be different? How? Would we see some of the people from the HP series when they were younger?! (You have no idea how much I need this)

In a way we did get slight mentions of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but they were never really the focus of the movie. The one character that did overlap both worlds, however, was Grindelwald. I won't really go into too much detail here because that would mean SPOILERS and honestly, I hadnt known about him until this movie

--

Characters

In terms of human characters, I was rather disappointed. We have our main protagonist, Newt Scamander who has a bunch of nearly extinct creatures in his suitcase, is studying them, and is trying to get one to Arizona, its natural habitat. But other than this quirky habit of caring for them and doing strange mating rituals, theres not much else to him. Yes, hes brave, yes hes got some connection to Dumbledore, but not much else.

Even his suitcase had more personality /sigh/

Throughout the whole movie I also had a hard time deciphering what he was saying! I thought maybe it was because of his (natural) accent but when I looked him up on the internet later, I found I could understand himwhy he was mumbling and extra accent-y is beyond me. (I mean, if they got Draco to enunciate, why couldn't they do it here? lol)

We also meet Tina who is part of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) and the one who ends up arresting Newt when he first arrives in NY (his niffler escapes and causes mayhem!). Of course, her arresting him and taking him in clue us in that shes been demoted and is no longer supposed to be arresting wizards (for some reason). Instead of letting Newt go, she becomes his shadow stalker and helps him recover his suitcase, which had been taken by a No-maj (muggle) who mistook it for his.

I initially didn't care much for her because she was just doing her job, but as the movie progresses she becomes more annoying. She pretty much has Newt under house arrest, follows him out when he escapes said house arrest, and gets him into trouble a lot. Like woman, Im sure there are other law breaking magical citizens out there, why the obsession here?!

I also felt it was harder to connect with her because she was the more selfish of the characters. All her actions were less because she was worried about exposure and more about trying to get promoted/recognition. Even at the end, when she had a change in character, I still didn't like her because her change came from self-preservation.

Plus, she was useless.

And the prize for human characters goes to lovebirds Jacob and Queenie! You have no idea how much I loved these two and how they interacted!

Here we have Jacob Kowalski (aspiring baker) and Tinas sister and roommate, Queenie Goldstein. Jacob is the no-maj who just happened to be at the wrong place when Newts niffler causes mayhem in NY. Accidentally taking Newts suitcase, Jacob releases a number of creatures out into the streets of NY and even gets bitten by one of them. Instead of being Obliviated, Jacob ends up helping Newt gather up his creatures.

I think I was particularly attracted to Jacobs character because he was a no-maj and was just so fascinated by the magical creatures. He helped out Newt care for them in the suitcase, he got chased by a huge Erumpent that wanted to mate with him, and still didn't freak out because technically this stuff isn't supposed to exist, right?

And then we have Queenie, who seems to be pretty lady of the series. She looks good and knows how to use that charm to her advantage! She is also well versed in legilimency, a sort of mind-reading ability, which I absolutely loved. I actually didn't think shed be a main character but she surprised me in actually taking action (unlike someone else in this movie)

Just going to say that near the end she has a scene with Jacob that legit broke my heart.

And don't even get me started with all the creatures inside Newts suitcase! I absolutely loved ALL of them! They all had such amazing personalities and I seriously wanted to help Newt take care of them. One of my favorites was this Niffler who loves taking shiny stuff and storing them into his bottomless pit of a stomach pouch

--

Magical Problems in NY

New York has recently been having problems with exposure as there is some creature out there wreaking havoc and a group called the New Salem Philanthropic Society are doubling their efforts to expose witches and kill them (because who else could be behind something so out of this world?). Of course, this means MACUSA needs to hurry up and find said creature unless they want to face exposure (except its never that simple)

To keep things spoiler free, the movie tried to confuse us as to who the creature was and very much failed. Not to mention that everything turned out a little TOO convenient if you ask me

--

Overall

Overall I think the movie was OK. It really tried to cram so many ideas into a 2 hour (ish) film, which I felt was its biggest downfall. I mean, the majority of the movie was spent finding the creatures that had escaped Newts bag, which I felt should have been enough for the one movie. But then they had to add the whole exposure aspect, which was less detailed and more rushed.

AND THEN, they had this whole Newt and Tina scene that made me want to facepalm because they had so little connection but it felt like they were lovers who had to part. We already had the Jacob and Queenie thing going for the romance aspect, why are we forcing these other two into something like that?? I don't know, to me it felt very unnatural and awkward

Another thing I wanted to mention (that probably has more to do with me), is that it was hard to watch this movie. At the beginning we get bombarded by a bunch of newspapers in quick succession that its hard to read any of them and even made me dizzy. This happened a couple more times in the movie (focus, unfocus, very fast movement) and I just really didn't like it.

I did hear Fantastic Beasts was going to be a total of 5 movies and that Newt wasn't going to be the protagonist in the next one. Im not sure how I feel about this. Part of me is like ok because Newt just wasn't my favorite but Im also worried about too many characters being introduced and not getting enough development.

The nice thing about Harry Potter was that we had the same characters and we got to see them develop and grow. In this case it seems less about the world and more about creating more movies.",1490313600,,7555,4.457577955039884

4561219,5,B00543R3WG,"This was a screenplay that was actually written by JK Rowling, which is awesome. No, its not a book, but she sets us up with knowledge for this movie with information on her website Pottermore. She has information about MACUSA and no-majs, as well as other schools in other countries, such as Ilvermorny in America. This is the same wizarding world of Harry Potter, but this series is looking ti set up the history of Grindlewald, the dark wizard before Voldemort, and Dumbledore's old comrade. There are so many details thrown in here that relate to things that are talked about in the Harry Potter books, and they help to clear up some questions. If you have read the books, read the Pottermore site, or even watched Jk interviews, this may be easier for you to understand. This world has become very in depth. As for the magical creatures, there are a plethora of them, and they are so fun to meet! Especially everyone's favorite, the niffler. The character's are all so fun, I really loved Queenie, the witch skilled in ligilimens, and was happy to learn the singer from A Fine Frenzy plays as her. There are so many hilarious parts, so many serious parts, and I found ir difficult not to love it. This movie set up a strong base for the next movies coming, and I truly cannot wait. My husband loved it so much after we saw it in theaters, that he wnated to go see it seceral more times in theaters. I fell in love with Harry Potter when I was just 11 years old, and now at 25, I am so happy that JK Rowling is giving us more to love!! I cannot wait to find out more about Leta Lestrange, why Newt was expelled, and more about Grindlewald and Dumbledore's relationship, as well as Ariana Dumbledore!

4561235,2,B00543R3WG,"Technically speaking, not a very good looking set on screen if I'm honest. Even the first film, made in 2001 should have looked better than it was ripped straight from DVD. Very dark set with little shadow details, little color pop and an overall hazy look. Three movies in to my first HP viewing (yes, EVER), I'm not impressed in the slightest. Audio - Well, playing on my calibrated Atmos 7.2.2 system it sounds bass-heavy and weak in the dynamic range dept., almost as if they compressed the ever-living cr** out of it after their DVD rip.. This reminds me of a bargain bin $5 copy rather than something one would pay $65 for. The rear of the case claims that it supports Dolby TrueHD, DTS Master Audio, and Dolby Digital, only the latter of which seems to be enabled on my set so far. Perhaps the later movies will support these formats? Can't be sure, so far they're not included on the first three flicks on my end. Shame..
Comparing this back to back with a single-version of the second movie that my wife has, it's clear that this bundle is of lower quality overall.

Packaging is weak also, came in a blue multi-disc plastic case under a cardboard cover as most BD's do. Thing is, there's nothing else there, no paperwork or anything for any of the films. What you get is plastic and 8 discs, that's it.

I can't speak on the movies themselves as I'm not a huge HP fan and haven't ever seen the movies or read the books, but I can say they don't include any 'bonus' material, deleted scenes or the like. Most simply just play straight away with no disc menu for setup options or CC. Suspect. Honestly, I'd either look for a different set or buy single releases if you're a huge HP fanboy. Otherwise these are fine if you don't care all that much and want a good bargain on all the movies at one time in a cohesive set. I simply wanted to see the movies because I missed out on all the books and flicks, glad I borrowed them from a friend instead of spending money on this particular set though.",1489795200,,2003,4.367292225201072
4561236,1,B00543R3WG,"First off, I just want to state my level of fanboy concerning HP so you don't think I am atroll. I started reading the series in 1999, went to every midnight book release, saw every movie in theaters multiple times, continued to re-read each book an average of twice a year and have read everything on pottermore. So here are some thoughts from a true potter fan.

THE GOOD:
The sets- This movie had a great combination of actual sets and CGI. The entire city wasn't CGI like the marvel movies and most blockbusters. I 100% bought the 1920s world of new York. It in fact just won an academy award. I opposed David Yates returning but he did a great job visually bringing us back to the world.

The actors- Everyone did a great job in this movie (aside from Depp). I absolutely loathe Eddie Redmayne but my baggage did not obstruct the performance. He had the perfect dash of quirky and was excellent (although the character itself is problematic, more on that later). The casting was top notch and I have no problem visiting these characters in future films (as long as the films get better).

The Niffler- My god I loved the niffler It just made me so happy. He was so damn cute, funny and leaped straight out of the book and into a purse. All of the animals overall were great.

THE BAD:
The story- This film should not have focused on Newt. The best thing about this movie is exploring America and the social struggles and seeing the plot from Grindlewald unfold. The extremely forced Order of the Phoenix style newspaper headlines for crammed exposition should have actually been in the film. This film focused too much on Newt showing off animals to the audience. The ending was also a slap in the face to potter fans. The best part of the books was finding out exactly how everything came together, and we get none of that. All we get is a Scooby-doo twist that rain wipes the slate clean, making this movie completely pointless in the grand scheme of things and hardly gets us excited for the future.

Newts characterization- While I liked Eddies performance, Newt was a terrible protagonist. Newt has no awareness or respect for the political climate of America and thinks he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Doesnt bother to obliviate, commits muggle/wizard crimes and is extremely casual about POSSIBLY STARTING A WIZARDING WAR AND EXPOSING WIZARDKIND!!!!!!! Claims his animals aren't dangerous, but has to tell one of them to not eat the brains of a human And why exactly is Newt in America? To release an animal illegally into the wild

Grindlewald- Holy crap this was an epic fail. He looks like a cartoonish villain even though he was a normal looking wizard in Deathly Hallows. You may say but Voldemort looked like a villain! However, not only did that look better, but he had split his soul seven times and was resurrected through a potion. Its another wacky Johnny Depp role, rather than a distinguished wizard to be feared.

THE UGLY:
There is really only one ugly aspect, but it has many bullet points.
J.K ROWLING F***ED UP CANNON AND THE FILM IS RIDDLED WITH MASSIVE INCONSISTENCIES!!!!!!!!!!

Legilimency is explicitly explained in the books to NOT BE MIND READING. It is more of a way to gauge the emotions and intentions of a character, to quote Snape the mind is not simply a book to be read. Not only that, but legilimency is a learned skill, not something you are born with. In this movie, Queenie reads minds left and right in the most clich way possible, and it is implied that she was born with it. Absolutely ridiculous that JK would overlook this for the sake of a film trope.

The obscurous- So this is a fairly interesting concept that I know a lot of people will dig, however I couldn't accept it. An obscurous is some type of void entity that spawns when a persons magic is suppressed and they are abused. It is said they have not appeared in centuries, except for one case that Newt discovered. Ok, first of all its ridiculous that Credence is the only wizard who is pushed to this point. Its like saying only 1 kid in New York is in a traumatic household. The other thing is abused wizards have already been established. Merope Gaunt, Ariana Dumbledore and you know HARRY F***ING POTTER!!!! J.K has even said that Ariana might have been an obscurous, which also is bonkers because in the book she died during a 3 way duel. If she did com-bust into a void, Dumbledore would not have lived with the guilt that he might have killed her during the duel. He is the greatest wizard ever and would have known about an obscurous. You can make some flimsy arguments about this topic, but they are all what ifs? and not backed up by anything. For me, its all bogus.

J.K made wizards live to 150 to fit this films timeline- Sorry people, despite what J.K and potter wikis say, wizards were only recently established to live long lives and its BS. There is no mention in the books about living longer and there are a million times when it could have been brought up. The books often have things to make the readers yearn for the world, and a longer life is one of the most desired. Ron never says when researching the Sorcerers stone by the way Harry, Wizards live longer than muggles! There is no jealousy from muggles present in the books. There is no mention of the difficulty wizard and muggle couples would have dealing with a large lifespan gap. This would have not only been present as an individual struggle, but could have been used as an argument for pure bloods. It is simply never ever, ever mentioned or implied. The oldest person is Auntie Muriel, who is said to be 107. However, it is implied that she is nearing the end of her days and is losing it. She says ""I'm 107"" like its an obvious indicator of her physical struggles, One major example in the movies in present in Half-Blood Prince. Hermione mentions that people think Dumbledore is losing it in his age. Harry says he cant be that old, he is like what? Ron replies 150? and they all have a good laugh, because it is inconceivable for a person to be that age. We muggles make the same types of joke. This is explicit proof that wizards cant live that long.

As a film fan, I would give this a 3 star rating, as a Potter fan, it barely gets a 1. This movie ignores the books completely and is targeted at people who only have watched the movies. I would understand this if it was another writer, but this is Rowling herself ruining her world. I truly think that she never re-read Harry Potter and forgot most of what she had written. J.K is oversaturating HP with too many first draft ideas on pottermore. She is trying to flesh out her world like Tolkien, except she wasn't a professor of Anglo-Saxon mythology and language.",1489708800,3,6738,4.5147540983606556
4561237,4,B00543R3WG,"If you're expecting a Harry Potter experience then be prepared for slight disappointment.

The storyline for this film is set before Harry Potter. If you have read any of the extras besides the main books, you have probably come across some of the history alread, but this film is the beginning of the detailed history of what happened before there was a Harry Potter. I look forward to the next films. I also wish this was going to be released as another book series, but it looks like that is not the case.",1489708800,12,651,4.336065573770492

For a fairly long movie, it has relatively no plot.  The love stories are very contrived and shallow and while parts of the movie were very pretty, several parts were downright cringe-worthy.  There seemed to be a fair share of opinion jabs in there that seemed to take away from the ""magic"" of the story.  I'll stick to Harry Potter, thanks.",1489622400,,513,4.655555555555556

Excellent, but I can only attribute most of that to my Internet connection, but the movie was great and it downloaded and is in my view file to be watched at any time. The only problem I ever have with these types of things is that exactly what happened this time I don't have one instance of me paying for this singular product. I have two instances where I was charged for this product. I was told that it would be solved. And I'm going on day number two and it still has not been resolved. I know a lot of people say that it's only $14 and some change but when you're charged for something twice. It just doesn't sit well in your mind. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie but I don't think I need to be charged twice so buyer beware. Make sure you understand how this operation works before you click that button but my family did enjoy the movie. Well, at least half of the family were not all home at the same time anymore so it's a good thing to have the in a repository where it could be viewed by the whole family, even if it's not all at once, and I don't have to deal with those CDs back in the day that was the thing and you could watch it whenever you want to put this set up is a lot better. I can still watch it whenever I want to and I don't have to keep those CDs out of the reach of the little ones and hope that they last as long as possible. There could be things that could happen online. I guess, but at least I'll have someone to argue about when that happens",1489622400,,1524,3.96742671009772

4561266,5,B00543R3WG,"MAJOR Harry Potter fan over here, but did not see this in theaters cuz my husband said he wasn't interested (I am not one to go alone anywhere) so I waited for it to come out. Surprisingly, my husband was the one that insisted we buy it instead of rent because he heard people talking about it at work, even though he said some people didn't like it and others, including an HP fan like myself, really liked it. I didn't watch any previews and heard mixed things from people as well but not from another fan directly, so I had no expectations and was happy to find that I LOVED IT!!! Maybe some people disagree with this, but I liked that almost everything was new...so people who weren't Potterheads didn't had to have seen previous movies (obviously they wouldn't have read the books cuz there's no logical way you can read them and not love them)...they did have some references and a major character that was only mentioned a lot in the HP books, so that was fun for me. I do have some nitpicking gripes about minor things that I'll go over below (**so don't keep reading past this paragraph to avoid spoilers!!**), but overall the movie was fast-paced from the second it started and I loved every second of it. One of the supporting characters was simply outstanding (not Redmayne) and he made my husband laugh very hard, and he made me sob like a baby at the end! I thought I had it all figured out, and I pretty much did, but I received a shock about my prediction and that just made it all better! It made me jump (a LOT) and one point I actually got off the couch to stand in front of the TV without knowing what I was doing because I was so enthralled. 10/10!

**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**
Here are the minor gripes I had (but weren't enough to take away from it overall cuz I'm not a judgemental brat like that):
1) the main girl character was wretched. I really hope we don't see her again cuz she was sooo annoying and just blech
2) There was a LOT of sub-storylines and I NEED AN ACTUAL BOOK FOR THIS PLEASE MS. ROWLING!!!
3) I have a lot of questions about a lot of things that, unless I somehow missed it all, went unanswered.
4) what was up with the President's hair??
5) American's should not have their own terms for Muggles. Nonmag...that just sounds gross and unnecessary
6) I couldn't understand a lot of what Eddie was saying, mainly because I'm horrible with accents but I felt like he could have pronounced things a bit clearer or spoken more slowly
7) WHY DID THEY DO THAT TO JACOB?! WHYYYYYYY (sobbing)",1489536000,2,2523,4.37953091684435

4561290,5,B00543R3WG,"As a massive ""Harry Potter"" fan, I couldn't wait to see this, especially after the disappointment that was ""The Cursed Child."" Eddie Redmayne is one of my favorite actors after his portrayal as Professor Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything,"" and my excitement for this movie increased with each trailer and TV spot showing him as the protagonist, Newt Scamander, a name familiar only to the most die-hard fans of the Wizarding World.

The plot needs no introduction. Trailers galore and the description on sites such as IMDb and Amazon, etc., tell you all you need to know without spoilers. That said, it's a great story, brought to life by Rowling and the cast of characters and, yes, beasts. From the moment the music starts, fans will feel right at home.

Characters like Jacob Kowalsky, Porpentina Goldstein and her sister Queenie, Percival Graves, Creedence Barebone (and the worst haircut ever committed to film), Seraphina Picquery, and more make the world come alive as Newt steps into a different sort of magical world, with a different school and different terminology. In fact, the characters are my favorite part of the film, Kowalski and the Goldstein sisters being the obvious standouts.

The creatures themselves are wonderful. They're weird, often cute, and always interesting. The only downside I can find with them, and perhaps my biggest flaw with the film in general, is that a few of the creatures that aren't focal points don't look incredibly real; the CGI doesn't look nearly as polished on them.

Besides that one minor flaw, the movie was spectacular, especially for a big fan of ""Harry Potter"" like myself. Without spoilers, there is only a single part of the film I feel could have been taken out, and it lasts only about two or three minutes.

When all is said and done, either as an introduction to the Wizarding World or a return, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great time for people both young and old.",1489276800,,1959,4.8532934131736525

4561296,2,B00543R3WG,"I love Harry Potter and this was a HUGE disappointment. First, the original series (at least the first few books) appealed to children. It gave them a sense of wonder and a feeling of empowerment. While they fought the ""Dark Lord"" nothing was presented too brutally. By later books much of the whimsy was replaced with darkness and horrific scenes of pain and torture which I didn't like and wouldn't let my 10 year old read. This story is charming in that it portrays several beautiful or adorable fantastic beasts. The plot, however, is dull. There are 2 villains. One adopts children and then repeatedly beats and tortures them. NOT appropriate for children. I didn't even understand the other villain - the backstory is too nebulous to determine why we should fear him or fight him. At least I wanted the evil step-mother to die.

Perhaps if this had been released as a book prior to the movie we would understand these relationships better. As an adult I felt no connection to the characters. There was little or no development in the main characters. I never saw any affection developing between Newt and Tina, but the chemistry between Queenie and Jacob was darling.  Many shortcuts were taken in the Harry Potter movies relative to the books. The movies are good alone. They are great if you've read the books because they do skip over important bits that you can fill in if you know the story. I felt the same about Fantastic Beasts - if I had known the story and the characters from reading a book I wouldn't have found the movie so shallow and boring.",1489276800,2,1562,4.635379061371841

  Newt Scamander (a character referenced in the HP series) has arrived in NYC with a mysterious case of magical creatures. He soon gets entangled with an agent from magical enforcement(Tina),  and a no maj (Jacob). They meet up with Tina's sister Queenie who is a great addition to the colorful cast of characters.
  It stays true to the series, and there's plenty of continuity detail for those HP geeks like me who love to keep the storyline legit! I couldn't help but parallel the prejudices with the no-maj (non magic/muggle) against the magic community with the general religious ferver and prejudices we have in our country today... great, subtle, poignant.

This movie mixes in some of the classic nostalgia from her Harry Potter series thrown in with a new, epic adventure set in the early 1900's. It has a beautiful mix of comedy, adventure, action, and a brilliant story to tie it all in together.

4561336,5,B00543R3WG,"Just tons and oodles of details.  Great production values.  2nd viewing mandatory.  I got my fill of magic from this one....magic every other minute.  Eddie's character is interesting....should evolve with the sequels.

Two days later, couldn't help myself....had to see again.  It transcends its plot in that the viewer wants to spend time with all these characters and the actors are pulling off authenticity so well that a second viewing leaves the deeper entertainments -- viewing these souls in the throes -- unmitigated.  Did many pauses to study the screen -- didn't bother my feel for the pacing.  I truly was interested in the story despite knowing so much.

3rd viewing not many days later.  Just a wonderful film with so much detailed and creativity.

8-14-17 4th viewing was remarkably able to still entertain me, and I would not willingly admit how much I'd forgotten ""enough"" to freshen up the piece.  The parts I remembered could be a film by themselves, and the parts I didn't remember could be a half dozen more.  Nice world they've imagineered.  And I have not mentioned THE BABE lest I come off droolish.  But, yeah, I still don't know who else was in her scenes.  I joke, but you know what I'm sayin'.  I'll gladly watch again within months, but can I hold out that long?  It's so sucks that I watch my favorites too much too soonly and get the works memorized too well to forget easily except by a great deal longer passage of time.  Speaking of which I ruined Passengers that way.  Now I'm in Passenger Prison -- doin' time until it gets renewed and watchable.  Don't make me admit how many other films I've gotten to way-passed-saturation.  Next up for this temptation is Wonder Woman being released in two weeks.  Wanna bet I see it three times in three days?  The film already owns me.....as does Fantastic Beasts and Where To See A Hawt Babe.",1488931200,109,1868,4.676923076923077

The real world is filled with many people that think differently, have different attitudes and thus enjoy life in different ways.  Unfortunately some viewers seek to make it miserable for everyone else when they should do the opposite to seek happiness as happiness is not found in self gratification or poor attitudes. I personally found this movie refreshing and a good mix of reality and fantasy.  However I am uncertain a sequel movie is a good idea as I don't think there is enough intellectual complexity to create one.  As for comic relief, I found it amusing and it was not overdone for my tastes.  When you add cheese, please make it pepper jack.

4561344,2,B00543R3WG,"Calling this Fantastic Beasts is like naming HP Ron Weasley. Could someone take JKs billions long enough to make her hungry for a great story again?
Pros:
New characters, different perspective in the world of HP. A+ actors (most of them) Decent CG and a wow at the end (for the actual actor not the character) Newt is one of those characters that will grow on you. He's a weirdo thats easy to like. Funny moments you can appreciate with supporting actors
Cons- It's fillers, no real story. Expecting Newt to run around like a Pokemon trainer picking up Beasts? forget it. That's about 15 mins of the movie and you've seen it in the trailers already. You can guess who the antagonist is 20 minutes in. It's like seeing a celebrity on Law and Order, you just know. The twists aren't twists, just lazy writing that hopes you'll be distracted by jazz fingers, then it's over. The credits run leaving you wondering if you missed the part about the Fantastic Beasts. Again, if you've seen the trailer you've seen all the beasts. CG zoo for 5 minutes and that's it.

This is an absolutely wonderful set! Discs play perfectly, packaging is well-designed, and it includes enough bonus content to satisfy a casual fan. (If you're hardcore on extras, the 31-disc Hogwarts set might suit you better.)

Stray observations:

There are 8 discs for the films themselves, while the others comprise the 8-part documentary Creating the World of Harry Potter. Extras specific to the films can be found on the movie discs (most are largely similar as the features on previous DVD editions).

The cardboard sleeves are pretty but a little on the flimsy side. Don't manhandle them too much.

This set was made in the UK, but since BRs are not region-locked, they should play in any BR player in the US (I use my PS4 and they run just fine). However, if you want the UV copies and live in the States, you will have to call Warner Bros to redeem and remove the lock on those.

The acting was very good. I particularly liked Katherine Waterston performance.

Several discs were scratched. Most of the scratched discs had anywhere from 1 to several skips and/or freezes. Most had fingerprints all over them. One disc will not load at all. I returned it and was sent a new set. Same problems again. I contacted Amazon and they were pretty great about it. They refunded me the money. I contacted Warner Bros. Home Entertaintainment. I sent the set to them. I received my 3rd set today. 1st disc I put in is having issues. I should note that I was asked (by Amazon rep) what type of equipment I have. All tvs and dvd players are name brand, high quality. Have had zero problems with any dvd in the rest of my library. Have had only problems with this set which is my favorite unfortunately.

I've seen lots of 5 star reviews for this movie and understand why. However, for me personally, the story could have had more depth and the characters and their relationships needed a bit more development. This movie could use a prequel!

Overall, this movie was pretty dark in comparison to other HP movies. It also dealt with heavier political and social themes. There was a spotlight on death, anger, and abuse. I can't say that I'll rewatch this movie, but i encourage everyone to see it at least once.",1487030400,2,603,4.626168224299065

4561467,5,B00543R3WG,"Produced and written by J.K Rowling - a fantasy adventure, a spin-off from the highly successful and popular 'Harry Potter
books/movies. (Her first attempt at screen-writting)
'Newt Scamander' (Eddie Redmayne)  a wizard and majizoologist apparently exiled from 'Hogwarts'  arrives by boat in
New York en-route to Arizona.
It's 1926, all is not well in New York strange things have been occurring, the blame directed at the local-magical society
who arouse deep suspicion and mistrust by their very presence....the society point the finger toward a dark-magician
'Gellert Grindelwald' the identity of whom is not known.
'Newt' carries a suitcase that has endless secrets within, magical and humongous creatures, when one accidentally escapes
a Niffler who is attracted to  shinny objects, 'Newt' chases it into the bank where an unsuspecting factory-worker/ wannabe
-baker 'Jacob Kowalski' (Dan Fogler) carrying an identical suit-case is trying to obtain a loan for a new shop venture from the
manager.
The cases are accidentally switched, 'Newt' has a case full of cakes, 'Jacob' carries a bag full of mysterious creatures.
'Newt' is charged for using magic without licence but released when it is found his case only contains cakes.....he is joined in
his search for his case by 'Tina'...after finding it, she takes 'Newt' and 'Jacob' home introducing them to her sister 'Queenie'
(Alison Sudoi) who takes an instant shine to the very confused 'Jacob' though romance is not permitted for American Witches
with No-Maj's such as is 'Jacob'
Well, the adventure continues for the unsuspecting 'Jacob' when he is taken into 'Newt's' magical case where he will meet
many of the creatures cared for by the majizoologist...nervously of course, but he does grow into the introduction..........
just how much can fit into a case ??
 'Newt'  is arrested along with confused accomplice 'Jacob' and 'Tina' (Katherine Waterston) who is a member of the New York
wizard society, who has tried to help catch the creatures that had escaped from the case, by officials believing one of 'Newt's'
creatures had killed presidential candidate senator Henry Shaw Jr.
'Jacob' is released, but 'Tina' and 'Newt' face a death sentence imposed by Director of Magical Security Percival Graves (Colin
Farrell)  accused of being in cahoots with the dark-magician...however they are rescued by 'Jacob' and 'Queenie'
Because of the destructive power of the Obscurus  'Graves' seeks it's host with intent to harness it's magic, whilst 'Newt' knows
he has to find the real cause of the destruction in New York knowing his creatures not to be responsible, but unlike 'Graves'
only wants to help the troubled-soul.
Mayhem follows as both men clash in the subway tunnel where the Obscurus host is found........
Has this all been a dream for 'Jacob' and indeed the people of New York ?? ......all's well that ends well  ?
A delightful tale with much humour and indeed superb special-effects throughout....set many years before Harry Potter's days..
in truth there are few links between the times, one or two characters that link, and of course the use of the wand.
J.K.Rowling's stories will, in my view, always be box-office hits because of the Potter series.....
This is certainly great family entertainment though perhaps a little scary for the very young.

The fifth disk looked clearly like it was from another set on DVD's (different text font etc.) it also skipped and paused near the end of the movie but after rewinding it and playing it back again it didn't glitch. I am hoping the last 3 disks are in good condition because otherwise this is a great deal, only about $6.50 per movie. The disks are inconsistent though as some of them have previews while some go straight to the menu screen and some have special features while others do not. If you are just looking to own all of the movies and don't care about those things than this is a great purchase. If you want all complete DVD's with special features and consistency this might not be right for you.",1485993600,,747,4.267605633802817

Yes, the individual sleeves are a bit delicate but with the solid box and sleeve it comes with I see no reason why this should be an issue if you are not rough with your set. The movies themselves are gorgeous, the only film a bit grainy was The Philospher'a Stone (the true name!) but that's to be expected. I fell in love with the movies all over again and there are hours upon hours upon hours of bonus features to get lost in.

The last thing I noticed is that the discs inside all look different, which I would not expect in a box set.

Also, a couple discs said ""Disc 1"" on them, like they were taken out of their original movie cases that had a special features disc and just put into this case.

We have watched all eight movies and all is great with a couple of exceptions where there is some defect that distorts the image in certain spots. I can't find a smudge or anything on the disc, so not sure what the problem is. We still are enjoying watching the movies again and again. All eight discs are stored in a nice, sturdy plastic case, plus the sleeve. Certain this is a perfect addition for any Harry Potter fan, and quite likely to create new fans after viewing.

4561673,1,B00543R3WG,"We bought the version that has the castle on the front and includes 8 disks. Very disappointed. There is no uniformity between the disks. Some of the movies don't have a menu, one has a weird trailer before the movie, some go to a menu, and there are weird copyright warnings in every single language before and after the movies. My sister has what appears to be the same set, but the dvd's all have trailers and then go to a menu before starting- like normal. We paid for what we thought was a professionally and legally manufactured copy. Doubted if it was even blu-ray at first, and the sixth movie says disk 1 on it, which makes it look like it's part of another set and someone put it into ours. Wouldn't purchase here. Again, very disappointed.",1484265600,,750,4.442028985507246

4561678,5,B00543R3WG,"As a hardcore Harry Potter fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  You have to realize that this is an entertainment movie so if you are looking for something that will change the way you think or will challenge you to become a better person, this is not your movie.  This is meant to entertain, and on that point, it is a smashing success!  I very much prefer the books to the movies, especially the early movies just because most child actors are so terrible.  Most of them turned out okay by the Half Blood Prince, but before that they were a little rough.  This movie had all of the elements I liked from the previous Harry Potter movies, exciting, engaging, interesting characters, ""fantastic creatures"", and great special effects, without the annoying cheesiness of the early Harry Potter movies.  If you love Harry Potter, then you will love this.  The inverse is probably true as well, if you didn't like the Harry Potter movies then you probably shouldn't watch this because you probably won't like it.

For me this movie embodied everything I like about the magical world without anything that really detracts. Its not a perfect movie, I could have done with a little more character development of the main character, but other than that there is nothing not to like.  I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fans.",1484265600,4,1327,4.734782608695652

It was also easy enough to contact UV and have them credit the movies for our region, so we are definitely keeping this. Overall, love this set. One note though - it likely has more to do with filming than the disks, but the audio is really unbalanced (deafening explosions and silent dialogue that no amount of adjusting audio output settings seems to fix).",1484092800,,669,4.491803278688525

None of our portable devices have a disc drive. Also, the packaging is VERY VERY cheap. The movie casings are flimsy, ripped easily and spewed the discs everywhere. Thankfully, they are all fine but we've only had the films for a few weeks and we've already had them ""spill"" out of the box multiple times. Very annoying.

4561851,1,B00543R3WG,"I just watched Magical Beasts and where to find them and I'm really turned off by the American Wizards.

1. The bad fake New York accents.

2. They all wear 1920s clothes, perfectly mundane 1920s clothes .Why do the British Wizards get to wear the cool eccentric robes but American wizards dress so plainly? And ""No Maj"" is really, really irritating.

3. Finally, the British Wizards have no death sentence but American wizards kill pretty eagerly. They know New York isn't Texas, right?!? Also why do the Wizards reflect the No Maj / Muggle politics? I would have hoped wizards (as they can travel anywhere very quickly) would have a more unified culture. And America wouldn't be treated as a uber modern / strict / harsh place. They need permits to have a wand?! And again... Why don't they wear robes? These are European descended wizards. Why wouldn't they have robes yet in the UK wizards wear traditional Wizard garb all the time. I feel J. K. Rowling is showing some innate bigotry against Americans here that has depleted the whimsy factor and made this portion of the wizarding world unnecessarily cold, sterile, and in certain aspects idiotic.

 And don't get me started on their rules about wizards not being allowed to interact with ""No Maj.""  God, I hate that term...  America's English developed differently from the original British English partly thanks to the Webster Dictionary changing particular words.  So WHY would Wizard slang be different?!  It makes no sense!

Perhaps someone should have shown her the Halloweentown movies from the Disney Channel featuring the late Debbie Reynolds. That was Harry Potter-esque yet set in America without taking away the whimsy and sense of Old World magical charm. And didn't require turning Americans into vaguely obnoxious stereotypes. It was charming despite the low budget. The wizards in America SHOULD have behaved just like the ones in the UK. People are people no matter where you are, after all. We are all human. Skip this. And re-watch Halloweentown in Debbie Reynolds memory. You won't regret it.

Also ""I have trouble reading Brit minds because of the accent.""  WTF!???",1483315200,9,2142,4.969187675070028

4561867,4,B00543R3WG,"So I got this for Christmas and absolutely loved it. It is only 8 discs with no bonus content, just letting everyone know that now. It's also the one with the castle on the front. Harry Potter: Complete 8-Film Collection, Blu-Ray DVDs.

The case quality is pretty low in my standards but it holds all 8 discs nicely with minimal amount of space. When I first opened the case, it would not close, and it took me a bit to figure out why, the disc holders would pop out a little and you would need to push them in every time you close the case. It is a little annoying to do so. Also, when I figured out how to close the case, the case is off set when I did close it and I tried to straighten it out, but it did not work.

The disc content themselves are very clear, so it's nice for the blu-ray content. However, I did notice that some content was missing from the movies, I don't know if it has anything to do with the UK version, but I would think it would have everything the US version did besides when saying ""Sorcerer's Stone"" it would be changed to ""Philosopher's Stone"". For example, in The Goblet of Fire film, after the two other schools' creative introductions to Hogwarts, the Hogwarts students would sing their school song, and that was not in the film. I also believe that this is the US version because the company producing it is Warner Brothers.

Over all, this is a good set to buy if you want to watch the films without paying for a lot of money, however, if you want a collector's edition box and all, the Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection (Blu-ray + DVD) the multi-format.

4561872,4,B00543R3WG,"I first want to state that for the price, this is an amazing deal!!! If you are a Potter fan, I guarantee you will be very happy with this purchase!!!

You will receive:
All 8 films in Blu Ray. (British version so film one is ""The Philosophers Stone."")
8 other Blu Ray disks of extras. (There are many hours of extras that any potter fan will find very interesting!!! I actually watched these disks before the movies.)

The packaging is as minimal as you can get, nothing fancy. You will receive a single cardboard box set, with four bi-folded cardboard DVD boxes, each holds 4 disks, with the top two disks being the movies, and the bottom two disks being the extras, so that if you opened all of the bi-folded compartments they would line up with the eight movies across the top and all of the extras across the bottom.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this order ""Five Stars"" is that if you live in the US, you will not be able to download the digital version that is supposed to come with the set. I imagine if I am ever bored enough, I will call amazon customer support, and see if they can rectify this problem. If so I will amend this review to five stars.)",1483142400,,1173,4.298642533936651

4561894,5,B00543R3WG,Excellent pricing for this complete film collection.  Even includes extras and deleted scenes that I have never seen before.  Would certainly recommend this collection if you are a Harry Potter fan.  Only reason that we bought the DVD collection over the Blu Ray collection is that we currently have more DVD players in the house than Blu Ray players.  Can't go wrong either way.,1483056000,,379,4.875

4561908,3,B00543R3WG,"So except for all the missing scenes it is ok.  I expected it to be the movie version I have seen on tv and it is missing a lot.  I have only watched the first 2 but I hear the 5th disc is the worst, a snapshot of the book.  This makes sense because it is a large book and one of the shortest movies.. Disappointing at best.",1483056000,,324,3.735294117647059
4561909,3,B00543R3WG,I got it and was pleased because it had all of the movies in blue ray like it said but when I went to download the digital copy they gave me a code that only worked in Great Britain or Ireland (where I don't live) so I was unable to download the digital copy that I was looking forward to.,1483056000,,289,3.8333333333333335

4561918,5,B00543R3WG,The 8 disc set folds out so is very handy if you are like me and don't have a lot of room to store DVD's. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and am so glad that I have them all in one set for convenience purposes.,1482969600,,206,3.5
4561919,2,B00543R3WG,"I bought the 8-disc blu-ray giftset (castle on the cover). I have not finished watching all of the movies, but there is something fishy about it. To be clear, it is not the movies themselves, but the group.

The discs look like they were just left over discs from individual movies that someone decided to combine and sell as a set. Movie 6 even says ""Disc 1"" on it, like it was originally part of a two disc set.

Most of the movies do not have menus. The movie just starts automatically. During the fifth movie, I tried pressing the menu button on the remote and it just took me to a really basic (like it was the world's first DVD or something) special features menu.

There is no way as far as I can see to select a scene, turn on commentaries, or other really basic DVD/blu-ray options. There is also no way to resume the movie if you press Stop (even for a moment). It just starts over at the beginning. All my other blu-rays will give an option to resume or restart even if the disc has been taken out.

I can't say anything about the other versions, but with this one I can't help but wonder if Amazon has started selling bootlegs.",1482969600,,1139,4.2592592592592595

4561922,5,B00543R3WG,"What is there to say about this? Harry Potter is a staple in our household, so when I saw these DVDs at the Black Friday price of almost 50% off, I had to pick them up for my boyfriends daughter so she can have a set of her very own at her house (I've had my own for years now). These are packaged nicely and include all 8 movies, and although there are no extras or special features included, they make a brilliant gift! If you're a Harry Potter fan, and only own 1 or 2 movies, I highly suggest this set. It will be worth the duplicate movies for an all-inclusive bundle!",1482969600,,573,4.079646017699115

4561980,5,B00543R3WG,"First, this review is about the 16 disc blu ray set
Please note :u/v code does not work in U.S.
the not so good: if you have kids with hands over everything, these discs are not secure. There are 4 discs (2 movies) per sleeve. They slide out all too easily.

That said,the video quality appears to be excellent. Best of all, my husband gets to enjoy these movies with me because they have Descriptive Audio, which means the action is described. That feature alone gets the rating. He has read all the books but let's face the facts: I'm a terrible narrator. I bought the movies for me and it is just such a bonus to us to have, finally, the descriptive narrative.",1482796800,,663,4.346774193548387

Nobody can argue the greatness of Harry Potter.

Anyway...

I ordered the 8 film bluray set of Harry Potter with the castle on the front as a gift for Christmas. I was super excited to give this set because I expected it to be a pretty nice high quality bluray set.

I was wrong...

The set did come with all 8 movies, but it looks like each disc came from a different set. None of the discs match. In fact, the sixth movie, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince says ""Disc 1 Movie"" on the disc when there's only 1 disc. And The Deathly Hallows Part One says ""The Movie"" on the disc implying that there is a second disc with bonus features or something for that movie as well. Like I said, it just seems like they grabbed random discs from other sets to make one complete set with all the movies.

I'm beginning to wonder if there's ever going to be a beautiful set of Harry Potter on bluray where all the discs match and look like they belong in one nice cohesive set.

I've read a few reviews on this specific set and a few people complain that the third movie which should be Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is actually the movie Polar Express when they put it in their bluray player.

I'll wait for confirmation from the gift receiver to find out if the third movie is the real third movie...",1482710400,3,1379,4.200757575757576

4562123,1,B00543R3WG,"Ugh, this movie was a waste of 133 minutes of life, a total fraud and ripoff by J.K. Rowlings,  Warner, and Heyday Films designed for the sole purpose of milking a few hundred millions dollars more of profit from the Harry Potter fanbase.

I went to see this movie in the theater with my three kids, who are more knowledgeable about the Harry Potter world than I am.  One daughter was a real Harry Potter fan when she was younger, and even she said the movie did not have much of a plot or any real purpose.  Although I am not a fan, I have seen all of the Harry Potter movies, usually with my kids, and they are at least somewhat entertaining.

You can summarize the plot of  ""Fantastical Beasts"" very simply - a young man goes to 1920's New York City for no particular reason, fights an evil wizard for no particular reason, all sorts of magical creatures appear and disappear along the way for no particular reason, and then .... The End.

This movie basically tried to stuff a constant stream of cameo appearances by magical creatures in place of a real plot with relatable human characters.  As a result, throughout the movie there were many of these ""Behold!"" moments  -

""Behold!  Another wondrous and magical creature!  I, the great J. K. Rowlings have created this for you, my loyal fans!  Because I know you have no life, and you hunger for more of  my creations, and you will keep giving me more of your money to see this dreck!""

To make things worse, Eddie Redmayne is also one of my Not Favorite actors of all time, a feeling that is only reinforced by this awful movie.  He's pretty good at playing transgenders and people crippled by neurodegenerative disorders, but otherwise, I find him a grating presence in any other sort of movie.

Are they really planning to make five of these post-Harry Potter movies in all?  Run away!  They only want to steal your money!",1482192000,11,1880,4.492625368731564

4562159,4,B00543R3WG,"***SPOILERS***
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them begins with an immediately likeable British wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) arriving in 1920s New York City. Through a bit of a mix up, he befriends Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Fogler), a lovable muggle aspiring to someday run his own bakery. Unfortunately, Newt soon discovers that the relations between magic peoples and muggles (called No-Majs in America) are strained. Marriages between the two groups are strictly forbidden, and allowing No-Majs to have knowledge of magic society in any way is illegal. Tensions are further strained due to a recent and mysterious series of magic-related events destroying parts of the city, and an anti-witchcraft group who reveres the Salem Witch Trials.

With a suitcase full of larger-than-life animals and an illegal No-Maj friend, Newt is swiftly caught by Porpentina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston), an ex-Auror working for the Magical Congress of the United States of America (abbreviated MACUSA). Newt and Jacob end up befriending Porpentina (Tina) and her ditsy mind-reading sister, Queenie. Like Harry, Hermione, and Ron from J. K. Rowlings original book series, these four diverse characters make up our new dream-team.

Through the eyes of these characters, the film gives us a brief tour of 1920s American magic society, most notably its extremely interesting version of the death penalty and the interior of the MACUSA government building. In addition, we get to see the expansive, museum-like magical biomes inside Newts suitcase, and finally a real erumpent. However, as we are seeing this heavily guarded magical world through the eyes of an adult accustomed to most of its workings, a great deal of the magic conveyed in the Harry Potter films is lost. The film becomes more of a period-piece with magic, rather than a magical period-piece.

In addition, the color tones of the film are primarily dark and more or less brown, similar to the color scheme of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This dark coloring is in part to convey the darker emotional tone of both movies, however, as this is our first entry into magical America, it significantly dulls the experience. Another similarity between these two films is the double story line. In Harry Potter, the first half of the film centers around a mysterious book. In the second half, however, the real problem comes to light: a plot to kill Dumbledore. The popularity of both the book and movie for the Harry Potter installment is due in part to the masterful interweaving of these storylines. In Fantastic Beasts, however, the two storylines are almost completely separate. The first is the story surrounding Newts suitcase and the animals that escape it. The second, and far more emotionally compelling, centers around the anti-witchcraft group.

This second storyline is by far the best thing the film has to offer, and its a shame that it wasn't woven in as closely with Newts suitcase as the two Harry Potter storylines. It almost feels like watching two separate movies  one for children during the first half, and one for adults in the second.

Although it seems imperfectly worked in to the film, this second storyline is extremely compelling. It centers around an idea briefly but repeatedly hinted at in the Harry Potter books: that a childs suppression of his or her magical ability can lead to one of the most destructive and abhorrent forces possible in the magical world: an Obscurus. Combine this with a young adult who is constantly beaten and abused by his extremely religious adoptive mother, and you get Credence, this movies main antagonist. Unlike Voldemort, we learn almost right away of the absolutely horrible life of this man, and also briefly his past relationship with Tina.

Once he reaches his breaking point, the magic suppressed within Credence begins to destroy the city, and it takes all of MACUSA to contain him. Newt and Tina are almost successful in calming him down and bringing him back to human form, but they are too late. He is killed, or at least mostly killed, by MACUSA, but a tiny wisp of his Obscurus floats away. Another government worker, who was the cause of Credences Obscurus release when he denied the boys ability to learn magic, is revealed to be Grindelwald, previously a friend but now an arch-enemy of Dumbledore, too fond of the mantra, for the greater good.

Speculation: Throughout the film, it is shown that Newt has some special relationship with Dumbledore and an Obscurus. Perhaps the missing link is Dumbledores daughter, as the books made it clear that Dumbledores main regret was that he neglected to care for his younger sister, who suppressed her magic due to childhood bullying, and who ended up killing her own mother. Possibly, she was the obscurus kept by Newt in his suitcase and the girl he mentioned being friends with. As this film series progresses, it is still unclear who will be the main villain. Grindelwald and Credence seem like the clear choices, but which is worse: an emotionally damaged young adult with immense, uncontrollable power, or an extremely powerful and experienced wizard whose ideals ensure the destruction of only non-magic people? J. K. Rowling is still keeping us guessing and speculating, and thats one of the biggest pieces of praise I have for the movie. In all the unexplained backstories mentioned throughout the film, there is still a huge potential for these to be as good or better than the Harry Potter films.",1481760000,2,5522,5.027322404371585

Want to relive your memories of watching the movies and reading the books, then come along and watch J.K. Rowlings Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them. This movie is Directed by David Yates the Director of Order of the Phoenix, Half Blood Prince, The Deathly Hallows Part I and II and the Legend of Tarzan. The screenplay is written by J.K.

4562199,4,B00543R3WG,"It doesn't have all that engrossing charm of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but I'm not a child any more and this movie isn't trying to be Harry Potter. It has a style, tone and pacing that's quite different from any of the Harry Potter movies, and that's fine. The story, much like its protagonist, searches around for what's important and has a lot of fun along the way. What some view as aimlessness I see as character-driven narrative. It takes a while for the full story to come into focus because the protagonist and his friends aren't privy to the full story. That's not bad writing, a lack of direction, or aimlessness, it's a style of storytelling.

Positives:
+The world and characters are a lot of fun.
+One or two of the fantastic beasts fall flat, but most of them are amazing to behold. Very good creature design, and a lot of thought went into making them feel interesting and unique.
+Top-notch performances. The acting in FBaWTFT is on par with the best performances in the Harry Potter series. Eddie Redmayne, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, and Dan Fogler are real stand-outs, putting a lot of heart and depth into the characters.
+It isn't smacking you in the face with ""THIS IS HARRY POTTER"" stuff all the time, like one might expect after seeing movies like Star Wars:The Force Awakens or Finding Dory.
+It's very re-watchable. The jokes always land, the visuals always wow, and the pacing is such that you won't feel bored during ""slow"" moments on subsequent viewings.

Negatives:
-The big reveal will make you wish ""Revilio"" wasn't a spell.
-The subplot of the newspaper owner and his sons doesn't go anywhere. The time spent with those characters could have easily gone to more important plot elements or more beasts.
-Some parts of the wizarding world of America feel illogical or need to be fleshed out better to make sense. Why can ""cops"" order immediate executions of prisoners? Why are American wizards so terrified of non-magical people? Why is so little interest given to the affairs of the wizarding world outside America?

Overall, I would give the movie a 7.5 out of 10. Quite good, a ton of fun, and you'll enjoy watching it numerous times.",1481500800,,2183,4.754617414248021

Dick, etc. Ms. ""Rowling"" (enough when the dopey pen names, too) is not visionary like the 3 people I just mentioned; and never will be. It is true irony when you take a man like Edgar Allan Poe: who is considered the first true writer of the short story (also the first Romanticist), sci-fi visionary and without began over 200 years ago. How she winds up a billionaire, and an incomparable genius like PKD ends up penniless. So I say enough with Eddie Redmayne already! I cannot turn around without seeing this guy in either (1) a comic book fantasy based film. or (B) a transgender/seemingly transgender role, or (C) anything which requires usage of heavy cgi/greenscreen filming.

4562235,5,B00543R3WG,"This film is in one word: delightful. In a movie world of broad shouldered, spandex clad superheroes, Newt is a breath of fresh air. His awkwardness with all things human, his preference for wool and tweet makes him a welcome change in hero-land. He is surrounded by a cast of other lovable characters. One of the great characters of this movie is the no-mag Jacob Kowalsky an aspiring baker who plants himself firmly in the life of Newt. He is everything that Newt is not: charming with animals as well as people. Talking about Jacob: his musical theme is just as memorable as Hedwigs. Its kind of jazzy and translates the essence of his character in music. Besides Jacob there are the witch sisters Tina, an auror and Queenie, someone who can see, hear or feel minds. Here is my only squabble with this film: female characters are not Rowlings strongpoint. They seem to lack any kind of ambiguity, they are uncreatively good or unimaginatively evil. Interesting thinking, feeling or plot development always seem to happen to men.

That said, the film is delightful in capturing a mood. The real main character are the roaring twenties with it s sense of dread and expectation of the new all at the same time. There is a darkness that seems to inhabit New York but at the same time there is a whimsicality brilliantly imagined in the nightclub scene. There is giggle water, a song about a flying pig and all kind of strange creatures.

Plot wise there are hints, beginnings of what may well become a strong plot. For now we meet the most important characters. The plot revolves around a creature that roames the streets of New York creating havoc where it appears. Is it one of Newt's or are there darker powers at work here? Rowling is a master in creating new imagery for the deeply seated human feelings like fear of the unknown, hatred of the more gifted in short the possibility to hate. On the other hand she shows what can overcome those prejudices: imagination, acceptance of the weird and awkward, a sense of fun and ultimately love (of course). Im excited to see how things turn out.

Is it a film for children? I don't know. Maybe its a bit slow. It certainly is scary. (But h, Im old).",1481241600,2,2198,4.587786259541985

4562237,5,B00543R3WG,"[12/14/2016 Edit] I reached out to Warner Bros' US branch and was successfully able to transfer the UK digital copies to my US account. They required a Flixster Video account, (which can be linked to Ultraviolet and is shared with services like Vudu) a copy of the receipt (A screenshot of my order on the Amazon app for iPhone sufficed) and a photo of the product showing the Ultraviolet banner on the cover as well as the slip with the U.K. Ultraviolet code. They responded within 24 hours of the initial request and made it easy! So for those who ran into the region lock on the digital copies, I hope this helps!

~~~

This is for the Blu-Ray format, not the DVD or Multi-Format.

Current edition as of 12/9/2016 is a single DVD box with four thin cardboard sleeves/folders separating the discs. The discs can be tricky to put back in, as it's just pockets in the cardboard folder. Not the best quality but it DOES look nice and it is a space saver. The discs are advertised as All Region, but I haven't had a chance to watch all the videos yet to verify this.

One thing to note: It DOES come with Ultraviolet copies, but they're region-locked for the UK and this is not clarified in the description. After another seller mentioned they had it overridden and directly added to their Ultraviolet library, I reached out to WB's customer service to see if I could get it overridden as well. I'll reach out to UV next if they don't come back with an answer, and edit this review to tell folks who to reach out to get the codes overridden for other regions.

Overall, for the value, getting all 8 movies for this price is fantastic. I picked up mine while it was on sale for $46 and I have absolutely no regrets. As a bonus it comes with the 8-disc documentary ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"", so some nice bonus features there!

Final verdict:
Pros: Excellent value (especially if you get it on sale), space saving packaging, comes with the bonus documentary, all 8 movies, All Region.
Cons: Flimsier packaging, UV codes are not specified as region locked.",1481241600,2,2062,4.514745308310992

4562268,2,B00543R3WG,"I've never been a fan of the Harry Potter series, but because of its cultural impact, I've acquainted myself somewhat with it.  I thought a different setting and group of characters would be refreshing and decided to check out this movie.  I followed it mostly but found it to be an overall disappointment.  For as many times it does something interesting, it does something illogical, confusing, or contrived.  Eddie Redmayne, who got an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, is a fantastic actor, but the movie de-elevates him over time to a supporting role and doesn't allow his whimsical personality to exhibit enough humor except at the beginning.  He arrives in 1920s New York with a case containing fantastic creatures, but after some escape, he has to regain them.  His life intersects with an aspiring baker's named Jacob, whose eagerness and naivete become very funny at several points in the movie.  The beginning and the end have the most humor, mainly because of those two interacting.  The end is also very funny because Jacob creates baked goods which look like the creatures he was exposed to even though he can't remember what had happened.  I mentioned that ""spoiler"" because I know it won't hurt your enjoyment of the ending even if you know it in advance.  The creatures J. K. Rowling envisioned are sometimes hilariously imaginative.

Those are the movie's strengths, but when only about a 5th of the movie is whimsical and interesting, and the rest is some convoluted plot involving terminology which never gets defined for those who aren't already intimately aware of the Harry Potter stuff, the movie is a failure.  This movie is awful as a whole, as everything except the very beginning and end has a poorly explained plot involving someone who's creating an oppressive magical creature which kills a senator.  The senator's purpose in the story is just to be killed, and his father is played by excellent actor Jon Voight, whose talents are wasted in this role which seems unneeded.  J. K. Rowling got way too carried away in writing this movie without thinking about how to make it interesting for someone who doesn't know everything about the Harry Potter terms already.  Every time there's an interesting idea, it gets wasted about a minute later as there's some CGI special effect which has nothing to do with whats already been explained in the story, and then everyone in the movie knows what happened and uses Harry Potter terms but I'm left wondering what's going on.  I later read the Wikipedia plot and understood everything I'd watched, except for the REASON WHY THE TWO VILLAINS WERE INTERESTED IN OVERTHROWING NEW YORK!  Why did they collaborate, and why did they want to overthrow everything?  (Johnny Depp plays one of em in a very brief appearance, which is not surprising.)  If you're going to develop a convoluted plot, you need to explain it better during its development, including the mechanisms by which they fulfill it--instead of rewriting the rules all the time about how magic can help them fulfill their evil goals--and you also need to have the motivations made clear.  This movie also is lousy in that theres almost no humor except at the beginning and end.  J. K. Rowling failed in this movie, and I wish this movie NO SUCCESS AT ALL!",1480896000,5,3315,4.862989323843417

4562277,5,B00543R3WG,"This is the first film of what is anticipated to be a multiple part film series (at least 5 films). It takes place in NYC circa 1926. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is in NYC from Britain. He is a collector of ""fantastic beasts"" and is attempting to keep them from extinction and use said creatures to instruct wizards about them. While in NYC he runs into difficulty and finds himself at odds with an Obscurial (a young powerful wizard who use the dark force) and Mr. Graves (Colin Farrell). He allies himself with Tina (Katherine Waterston) clearly a future love interest, Queenie (Alison Sudol) a mind reader who oozes with Luna Lovegood simplicity and a likeable human (Dan Fogler).

There are a few things to note, one is the differences in culture and slang between the US and English wizards. The names lack the astrological significance as the Potter series. The magic words also appear crude and unlike English words made to sound Latin. There is a single reference to Transfiguration Professor Albus Dumbledore. He was famous for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald. This is part of the background for the film.

On the surface, the film appears to have let loose the special effects people and then create a film around it. Newt Scamander starts off as a low key character devoid of the personality normally associated with Rowling's characters.

4562292,5,B00543R3WG,"This movie was everything I wanted and needed from a continuation of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world. In fact, it felt like it was a movie not designed for the kiddos now, but the adults who grew up reading Harry's adventures.

And somehow this one wiggled in and became my favorite out of the now 9 wizarding world movies. My favorite. I have a slight theory that Newt is autistic, because throughout the movie I kept thinking of how much his behavior reminds me of my own daughter's. Whether or not it was intentionally written by the author, it enchanted Joi and she was incredibly impressed by him and his creatures.

My only grievance is the slight unlikability of one of the secondary characters, a former auror wanting to slide back into good graces. I had trouble liking her initially but felt she was thoroughly redeemed later.
On the other secondary characters, you have a male who isn't classically beautiful like the others. Eddie Redmayne is an attractive guy *swoon* and so were the female co-stars, but then you've got the Everyman Guy. The Average Joe who actually attracts a hot woman at one point in the film. We need more of that in Hollywood. We need more Everyday Dudes who aren't hunkily busting out of their shirts. Yes, I love a hot Tarzan looking dude any day of the week but I think it behooves Hollywood to give us more people the rest of us can physically relate to in situations we aspire to be in.

If there were clumsy parts, I think they affected me for all of 5 seconds and were forgotten, swept away by the haze of magic. This movie was one beautiful visualization to another, wonderfully choreographed scenes using beasts, and so much magic from skilled adult wizards to make up for the sometimes awkward skill we've experienced through watching Harry grow up. I will always love Harry, but Newt is my new favorite hero.",1480809600,43,1854,4.62917933130699

4562299,4,B00543R3WG,"A very enjoyable movie. Although I am not a super fan, nor follow this author's books with the Harry Potter franchise, I did never the less liked this film.

  The story in brief (because going into the theater I had no idea what the plot was?): A group of twenty to thirty something adult wizards, who live in the shadows of New York society in the 1920's, try to protect a brief case which is really a secret magical portal into a fantasy neither world zoo where the most spectacular alien like creatures reside.  This fantasy takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, and places with names are mentioned in this story.

 The special effects and CGI animation in this film is nothing short of spectacular, and I found many of the creature characters like the elf and goblin midget creatures in the background scenes really entertaining to see again.  The wizard priests, and the sorceresses were interesting and the costume with the sets got the 1920's (the economic turbulent inter-war period) down very well. All of it was enjoyable and decent enough for me to recommend the movie.

 Now here is my main complaint, and it is not against the filmmakers but against Hollywood's MPAA rating board.  I want to ask these morons what movie did they watch to give this film a PG-13 rating?? Did they see the same movie I did???  This film is fine for young kids despite a few frightening images, and I think the rating should have honestly been G.

 The MPAA is a major bain on America's pop culture entertainment, for none of their modern ratings really make any sense, for they cater too much to political correctness and to political special interest groups who complain like three year children and in all honesty should be completely ignored.  I urge everyone to use their own rational judgement regarding tv shows and movies, if it is obviously not a kiddie film then do not take your kids to it, but if it is a fine piece of art like this movie then consider taking all the kids, thus just ignore today's movie rating system because today in 2016 it isn't rational anymore.  This movie gets a solid B+, it is much better than I thought it would be, so I was surprised.  Thumbs up.",1480723200,,2192,4.553571428571429

4562303,4,B00543R3WG,"Two films this month  have restored my faith that its actually possible to make obscenely expensive, special-effects-stuffed blockbusters that are actually good.

Both are lead by unconventional British actors who would look more at home at a library (or comic-book store) than on Muscle Beach.

The first, of course is Doctor Strange, the Marvel box-office marvel led by lanky Sherlock smartypants Benedict Cumberbatch.

As enjoyable as it is, that superhero picture is surpassed in every way by Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, an enchanting new entry in the J.K. Rowling cinematic universe starring equally lanky Eddie Redmayne.

For one thing, Fantastic Beasts actually has a story.

Theres even an honest-to-goodness subtext.

It had better be good: Fantastic Beasts, which follows eight profitable Harry Potter films, was made for a reported budget of $225 million.

Scripted by Rowling and directed by David Yates, who helmed the final four Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts is a spin-off inspired by one of Harry's textbooks, an idiosyncratic guide to magical animals purportedly written by one Newt Scamander.

The film is an origin story of sorts, explaining how the talented globetrotting wizard came to write his book.

And how was that?

By coming to America, of course.

Set during the 1920s, Fantastic Beasts opens with Newts arrival in New York. The Oscar-winning Redmayne plays him to perfection as an awkward, maladroit young wizard who is far more comfortable around animals than people.

Expelled from Hogwarts, he has been a social outcast who travels the globe in search of magical creatures, which he captures and keeps in his suitcase  an awesome magical device that encloses a massive nature preserve.

For the most part, Newt has been left alone.

That changes when some of his pets escape the case.

Yates and Rowling, whose film is propelled by a potent mix of CGI and lyrical romanticism, have buckets of fun with these magical beings. Its clear they delight in their creations.

One of Newts pals is a small, cute, and furry platypuslike dude that is fascinated by things that shine. A terrific early scene in a bank has it darting around stealing coins, rings, necklaces, and pocket watches.

Another beast, a tiny green stick insect that lives in Newts jacket pocket, can pick locks and comes in handy when Newt gets stuck in the banks vault.

Fantastic Beasts has two parallel story lines. In the first, Newt chases down his escaped beasts with help of a motley crew: a working class no-maj (the American word for a Muggle), wonderfully portrayed by Dan Fogler (Barely Lethal), and two comely female wizards, Porpentina ""Tina"" Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) and her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol).

The three actors are part of a marvelous ensemble cast that also includes Colin Farrell, Jon Voight, Samantha Morton, Carmen Ejogo, and Johnny Depp.

The second, darker story is about a series of deadly attacks by an evil magical entity that have all but shut down New York.

Newt is sucked into the struggle when hes arrested by security officers from the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) as the wizard responsible for the terror attacks.

His crime, we find out, comes with the death penalty.

Terror attacks? Security forces? The death penalty?

For better or worse, Fantastic Beasts has a whopper of  a subtext, a blanket critique of American society that continuously rises up from every nook and cranny of the story.

Rowling paints a disturbing, even ugly, picture of America as a violent cauldron of repression and xenophobia ruled by paranoia and fear. Its the era of Prohibition, and people are beset on all sides by self-appointed guardians of morality and patriotism.

This may be a period piece, Rowling suggests, but its really about life in the age of the war on terror, the war on illegal immigration, the war on drugs  and, at least as Rowling sees it, the war on the poor. The New York we see here is controlled by malevolent robber barons and greedy, narcissistic politicians.

Yates and Rowling skillfully weave their bleak  and blunt-edged  message into the fabric of the story. It might be wildly out of place in a fantasy aimed at tweens, but its a welcome change from the usual vapid blockbuster.",1480723200,,4288,5.0028208744710865

4562309,5,B00543R3WG,"Newt is ridiculously easy to like. Incredibly competent within his own sphere, he's awkward and uncertain everywhere else. (You know how to tell when a nerd likes you? He looks at your shoes when he talks to you.) And, like so many adepts in so many arcane or academic arts, he seems to have no idea what a beginner in his own specialty might not know. Yes, those beasts are harmless - to anyone who's dedicated a lifetime to understanding them and learning how to harness their power.

So, when a few get loose in a 1930-ish New York City, hilarity ensues. But, like all the Potter movies, this has a lot going on. The ever-present shadow of the bad guy (sort of a pre-Voldemort), magic vs. muggle tension, and a non-magical guy way too involved for his own good, they all wind together to give this movie texture. After you see how he becomes part of the plot, I don't think it spoils anything to say the mo-maj (muggle) is a big part of a happy ending.

I'm not a serious Potter fanatic (even though my Best Beloved and I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Azkaban/dp/B000W745CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Azkaban</a>&nbsp;as our honeymoon).

4562321,5,B00543R3WG,"From the moment I heard about J.K. Rowling writing a screenplay inspired by her anthology Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, I was both excited and nervous. Like many others, my childhood and love of reading were fostered by Rowling's incredible Harry Potter series. After the huge commercial and critical success of the 8 Harry Potter films, a spin off of some kind seemed inevitable. Thankfully, Warner Bros. brought most of the filmmakers responsible for those films back to bring Rowling's new story to life. Still, without the success of preexisting source material, Fantastic Beasts was anything but a safe bet.

The film opens with British wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) arriving into 1920's New York City. Armed with a suitcase full of illicit magical creatures, all cleverly hidden from the eyes of Muggles (No-Maj's non magical people are called in America), Newt plans to make his way to Arizona to release one of his beasts. As he walks the streets of New York, he is drawn to a large gathering in front of a bank where a woman from the New Salem Philanthropic Society speaks of the evils of wizards and the need for a re institution of witch hunts.

A bump in with No-Maj man leads to an unintentional switch in suitcases and the eventual escape of many of Newt's animals. With magical creatures running freely through the heavily populated New York, Newt must turn to the assistance of a group of American Wizards and a No-Maj to capture the beasts. Failure to return the creatures to the safety of his suitcase would place Scamander in serious trouble and threaten to expose the entire magical community to a world that is growing less and less tolerant of their existence.

I'll admit to having mixed emotions going into this film. On the one hand, I had faith that Rowling would provide a story that would be a worthy successor to her acclaimed Potter series. At the same time, the announcement of Fantastic Beasts being the start of a five film series had me worried that this franchise would be nothing more than a cash grab. As the movie opened, I feared that my predictions would come true. The mistaken suitcase switch seemed like a rather cliche device that was not worthy of the Potter universe.

Those fears were quickly assuaged as Scamander stepped into the vast expanses of his creature carrying case. The film ends up feeling very different from the Potter story, but equally as magical and engaging. Newt Scamander is a misunderstood outcast who sees good in creatures that most would ignore or run from. Each cast member brilliantly brings their characters to life with skill and great care. For her part, Rowling presents a story that is much more complex and layered than I initially perceived. Fantastic Beasts spins an extraordinary fable of acceptance of differences and the role of politics in the fight for those who may be seen as ""other"". The end of the film provides a satisfying closure to Scamander's story while opening the possibilities to expand the story into what is sure to be a unique franchise. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is easily the most original and exciting blockbuster of the year, and I can't wait to see where Rowling and company will take this story next!",1480550400,,3242,4.794275491949911

4562340,4,B00543R3WG,"My wife and I just saw this movie and found it frustratingly even in plot and acting. The ending was powerful, uplifting, and beautifully moving. But to get there you had to wade almost two hours through an overly complicated plot that plods along at (too many) times, due to scenes that are too long and an uneven performance by its stellar cast.

Too much time was spent hunting for escaped fantastic beasts. And one such scene was absolutely ludicrous. All of these scenes could have been much shorter, pushing the story along a bit quicker. Additionally, two much was given away too early with regard to the fantastic beasts, instead of springing a major surprise at the end that would have been overwhelming. Most of the acting was brilliant, but the female protagonist love interest (Tina  Katherine Waterson) was weak and even stiff - dragging down the story. Two of the secondary characters (Queenie  Alison Sudol and Kowalski  Dan Fogler) were fantastic and added a lot to the movie.  Of course, it was nice seeing big names like Eddie Redmayne (Newt), Colin Farrel (Graves), John Voit (Shaw Senior), Ron Perlman (Gnarlack),  and, of course, Johnny Depp.

Would I pay to see this movie again in theaters? Probably  especially the last 30 minutes. But it was painful getting there  so I might be tempted to sneak in an alcoholic beverage or two  or to skip the first two hours altogether.",1480377600,2,1396,4.779166666666667

4562350,5,B00543R3WG,"J.K. Rowling may have ended the Harry Potter series, but she isn't done writing about her magical world. Her latest series Fantastic Beasts has finally hit theaters, with the first of what will be a five film series, that starts off a hundred years before Harry Potter stepped into Hogwarts. The film is centered on Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who has come to New York City as part of his quest to save the endangered species of the magical world. These creatures live in what appears to be a suitcase, but when some of them escape and a muggle is exposed to Scamander's attempts to retrieve them, he finds himself in a world of trouble. Scamander's only salvation is that with another unknown creature and a dark wizard on the loose, there are other things to worry about, so he is sent with an agent (Katherine Waterston), and the muggle, to collect his creatures and to try to help figure out what is going on. Even though this movie takes place a hundred years before Harry Potter the special effects and especially the CGI on all the creatures involved is amazing! Even if I watched this film without the sound on, I'd still be blown away by how visually impactful it is. As for it's star, they cast one of the biggest up and comers in Hollywood, Eddie Redmayne, and he is perfect for the role. Redmayne is exactly like Harry and the kind of character Rowling loves to write about. He's this geeky, skinny, soft spoken, lovable loser, that no one would expect to be perhaps a hero in waiting. Aside from some corny jokes thrown in for the kids and die hard Potter fans, this movie was absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to see where it goes next. Rowling has stated that the other films will focus on other characters, including a younger Dumbledore, which I'm a bit indifferent to. I really liked this film, and I am curious to know what would be the point in a sequel that starts over. I'd imagine it would be to introduce everyone and then bring them all together in the end, but no matter what they do, the producers will be hard pressed to out due this film.",1480291200,3,2076,4.480211081794195

4562389,4,B00543R3WG,"""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" is great. This is how the story goes: The year is 1926 and Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident...were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt's fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.

The cast led by Eddie Redmayne (solid as usual as Newt Scamander) is great. The directing by David Yates is great. The story & screenplay by J.K. Rowling (who also produced) is great.

The music by James Newton Howard is great. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is great. The film editing by Mark Day is great. The casting by Fiona Weir is great. The production design by Stuart Craig is great. The art direction by David Allday, Guy Bradley, Toby Britton, Peter Dorme, Gavin Fitch, Martin Foley & Hayley Easton Street is great. The set decoration by Anna Pinnock is great. The costume design by Colleen Atwood is great. The make-up design by Fae Hammond is great. The special effects coordinated by Victoria Cadiou and designed by Jason Marsh is great. The visual effects coordinated by Sam Ashford-Rowe, Marie-Pier Barrette, Teresa Berus, Aleksandra Bjelica, Ann-Marie Blommaert, Sara Bourque, Zaira Brilhante, Daniel Charchuk, Lucy & Natalie Cooke, Paul Docherty, Izzy Field, James Fouche, Thibaud Galbois, Sam Girdler, Louis-Charles Lapointe, Virginie Lavalle, Ethan Maharaj, Julie-Ann Marks, Zoe Medcraft, Daniel Moody, Laurie Pellard, Vishal Rustgi, Kasey Simpson, Kath Smith, Josh Sykes, Nancy Xu and James Yeoman & supervised by Arnaud Brisebois, Tim Burke, Ferran Domenech, Anthony Dunifer, Nicolas Hernandez, Andy Kind, Christian Manz, Andrew Morley, Stephane Naze, Olcun Tan & Ben White is great. The stunts coordinated by Ami Verge is great.

This is a great, solidly-crafted film that is entertaining and well-done. Eddie Redmayne is solid as usual as Newt Scamander and his supporting cast led by Katherine Waterston (as Tina) is just as solid as he is. David Yates has directed another great film to his resume. J.K. Rowling has written a solidly-crafted first screenplay. This is one of the better films of the year and also one of the better films of the holiday season, as well, too.",1480118400,,2424,5.116161616161616
4562390,3,B00543R3WG,"A socially clumsy English mage by the name of Newt arrives in New York carrying a magical suitcase that contains numerous fantastic animal, which includes a kleptomaniac platypus. His aim is to restore some of them back to the wild in Arizona since he obtained them from traffickers. Some of them get loose and he's trying to recapture them, but comes into trouble with the local association of witches/magicians. He teams up with a chap that only wants to establish a bakery and a witch that has been demoted within the agency. Meanwhile, bad (magical) things are happening in New York independent of Newt and his wayward menagerie.

Good acting and good special effects, so why only 3 stars? I just couldn't force myself to care for any of the characters except for the well meaning baker. There was something missing. One scene in particular made me cringe. It's when Newt tries to recapture a rhinoceros-like creature which is in heat. The whole scene was pathetic.

A couple of good points: Jon Voigt makes an appearance (we see to little of him in movies), and, Rowling continues to lambast the lying, hypocritical media, something she started in the Harry Potter movies.",1480032000,4,1177,4.850746268656716
4562391,4,B00543R3WG,"For those who like Harry Potter, you really can't go wrong with this one. This is the perfect way to bring back this franchise, by making the film about new characters in a new story, we get to return to this wonderful world while Harry's legacy get's to be left alone.(No, I have no interest in The Cursed Child.)
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS BY THE WAY!
Was the film perfect, no. All the Grindelwald stuff was interesting and I'm excited to see more of him, but I actually would have appreciated more set up as strange as that sounds. I loved seeing Johnny Depp at the end, but I would have liked to understand a bit more of, say, why has he been dressing up as Colin Farrell all this time and infiltrating the Ministry(or whatever they call it) all this time? I'm sure there's a good explanation(maybe he was just after the kid or something), but we'll have to wait.  This film actually works fine as a stand alone movie which is fine yet odd seeing how their planning four sequels. Then again, Sorcerers Stone pretty much did the same thing.
Also, where the hell were Jacob and Queenie during the final battle? She was going to help her sister but then Jacob asks to come with but she says he can't but then Jacob says he should and then she puts her hand on his face and it appears that she's thinking...... and then we don't see either of them again until after all the fightings over........... That's weird man.
The film doesn't quite rank with the best of the Potter franchise but, as a film that has to set up so much new stuff, I wasn't really expecting it to.(I had hope though.)
I'm being way to hard on this film because truth is, I thought it was great. I kind of loved it.
I really enjoyed our four new protagonists. Each of them is a totally different character that contributes to the team. Are Newt, Tina, Jacob and Queenie the next Harry, Ron and Hermione? Not yet, but it's only been one film and I'm very excited to see these characters grow and see their relationships deepen over the next four films. Maybe we can see a deeper friendship between Newt and Queenie as well as, actually I just realized, Tina and Jacob really don't have much interaction in this film at all. Not on a personal level at least. Yeah, I definitely want to see more of a friendship between them in the next four films.
The Jacob/Queenie romance was nice, at least once they actually start to know each other and it moves on from pure attraction.
I have to say though, the Newt/Tina romance has to be one of the most believable movie romances i've seen in years. Compelling stuff.
Newt is a great lead character, always extremely selfless and caring. Tina is really strong and determined but never losing track of what is really important. Jacob is just your average guy thrust into this crazy wizerding world but he steps up to the plate with true bravery. When we meet Queenie she is pretty much just really flirty but she definitely becomes a lot more three demential as the film goes on. Not to mention she launches what might just be this years most thrilling prison break.
Eddie Redmayne, Kathrine Waterston, Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol are all fantastic and I'm very excited to see them grow into their roles even further just like Danial Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson did in what feels like so many years ago.
On the flip side, I'm really excited for Grindelwald as a villain. Graves/Grindelwald is just such a cool villain. He's interesting too. Is he the next Voldemort? Not yet, but with Johnny Depp in the Harry Potter Universe, under David Yates' direction, the potential is endless!
David Yates returning to direct is a big part of why I was so excited about this movie and he does not disappoint! He does a great job setting things up in the first half of the film but once the action starts rolling in the second half, forget it, you are in for one of the best rides of the year!
J.K.Rowling doesn't disappoint with the script either!
James Newton Howard composes a musical score that is everything it needs to be: memorable!
The Credence plot twist was solid and unexpected!
Lastly, David Yates keeps the nostalgia coming despite the completely new characters, setting and story! I particularly loved what I think was a giant Pensieve during the scene when their about to execute Tina. Also, 5 years ago I sat down in a theater to see ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" and I thought to myself ""Wow. Last time ever I'll get to see the camera float through the Warner Bros logo followed by a silver title to come floating through."" It just comes to show you never know what the future holds!
Anyway, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was fantastic! It does everything it needs to to honor the legacy of the originals while setting up a series of it's own and I truly cannot wait for what's to come!",1480032000,8,4820,4.489749430523918

4562396,4,B00543R3WG,"(I rate this film 3.5 stars, generally good but as not as good as the original HP films.) Francis Ford Coppola once said that to make a film work, a filmmaker should be able to sum up the entire film in a single word or phrase. (He defined his epic ""The Godfather"" as ""succession"".) In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I wasn't quite sure of the main focus of the film, in other words I couldn't find a single phrase to sum to up what the story was about. Hence the film moves in many different directions, and while there is much to praise in the film, the screenplay was in need of a few more rewrites. At first the main focus seemed to be ""save the beasts"" but later it became ""stop the Obscurus"". Even by film's end, I wasn't entire convinced how these two ideas related to each other.

Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a Hogwarts graduate and scholar of fantastic beasts of sorts, arrives in New York. Scamander's character seems literally a cross between Harry Potter and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking (whom Redmayne played in the 2014 film ""The Theory of Everything""). He's been engaged in a long quest to stop the highest officials of the magic world from exterminating the many magical beasts which infiltrate the magic world. The political body in America has been concerned that sometimes these beasts slip into the muggle (non-magic) world, and they are dedicated to ensure the muggle world never become privy to the magic world. Newt has brought with him a special ""case"" which contains many of these magical beasts, sort of like the magical equivalent of Noah's Ark.

Scamander crosses paths with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a lovable nobody muggle/no-maj who simply desires to create a bakery in the city. He is going to one of the local banks to plead for a loan, and he also carries a case similar in size, color and design to that being held by Scamander, although his is simply filled with samples of his pastries. Through several happenstance encounters causing several of Newt's beasts to escape into the muggle world, Jacob and Newt become reluctant bedfellows, so-to-speak, as Jacob is introduced to the magic world before he can be ""obliviated"", the magic world's term for erasing muggles' memories of magic encounters. Newt is then arrested by Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), an agent of the Ministry of Magic, Auror division, which enforces the strict law of magic, which includes keeping muggles ignorant of the presence of magic people. They also meet Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol), Tina's roommate who takes a liking to Jacob.

Simultaneously, the city is being ravaged by an unseen ""force"" which seems to have supernatural qualities and inclinations. This thing enjoys chewing up buildings and streets and then spitting them into rubble. An anti-witch/anti-magic group run by Mary Lou Barebone is making street speeches that ""something"" is invading their city, preaching on a soap box a little bit like Aimee Semple McPherson of the Pentecostal movement in Los Angeles in the early 20th century. She seems to be aware of the presence of ""magic people"" and fantastic beasts in her midst. She also runs an orphanage and ""cares"" for several children: Credence, Chastity, and Modesty. The eldest, a young man, is Credence who wears funereal clothing and acts and appears to be constantly troubled. At one point, the Barebone ""family"" (if family they can be called) enter one of the local newspapers asking the editor Henry Shaw, Sr. (Jon Voight) to look into the matter. He refuses the request. Credence is then befriended by someone in the magic world: Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), one of the top officials in the Ministry of Magic in America. Graves promises Credence he will become ""welcome"" in the magic world if the younger man helps him to find the dark force, called an obscurus; Graves is convinced the force is someone in the Barebone orphanage.

The story then moves basically on three fronts: Newt dealing with his escaped magical creatures, the anti-magic society among whom Credence has befriended a wizard and Ministry of Magic official, and the strange dark ""force"" which runs rampant through the city, smashing up the metropolis into the equivalent of Dresden during the Second World War. While these different ideas do finally converge by film's end, much of how all the pieces fit was very confusing. Some of the sequences where Newt was chasing escaped beasts, trying to get them back into his case, went on for too long. One good sequence, which is I think Rowling's strength, is when Newt introduces Jacob to his menagerie of beasts inside his case.

Overall, generally a good film, but it needed to be tightened more. The Harry Potter films were much better focused while this film seemed a bit ""all over the place"". Personally, the first 1/2 hour and the last 1/2 hour were the most interesting. Some parts of the middle hour were often perplexing. I liked the acting of all the leads, although sometimes Newt (Redmayne) was a bit difficult to hear, and he would move his head somewhat away from the camera. When he describes the dark force ""the obscurus"", he was somewhat enigmatic in his explanation. Maybe I wanted a flashback to see the creation of the obscurus and what it was about rather than the endless ""lets get the creature"" before the muggles find out sequences. Still, generally it holds together, but it was close to a misfire.",1479859200,,5419,4.866738894907909
4562397,4,B00543R3WG,"The Harry Potter franchise was far too massive (and profitable) to be allowed to just end. Fortunately, any good fantasy world has the scope for more stories to be told.

And this brings us ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" based (using the term loosely) on a pamphlet-sized ""textbook"" on magical creatures written by J. K. Rowling. This first movie in a new pentalogy is a fairly solid adventure set in 1920s New York -- there are a few tenuous connections to the previous Potter stories, but otherwise this is its own tale of whimsical creatures, political oppression and big swoopy dark cloud things.

Magical zoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York with a magical suitcase filled with strange and wondrous creatures, which he hopes to educate his fellow wizards about. But he runs into trouble almost as soon as he lands -- he runs afoul of a stern MACUSA agent named Tina (Katherine Waterston), and his briefcase is accidentally taken by a No-Maj (aka Muggle) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). When Jacob opens the suitcase, dozens of magical creatures stream out and begin running wild across the city.

So Newt begins trying to recapture all his escaped creatures, with the assistance of the amazed Jacob, who had never dreamed that witches, wizards and fantastic beasts could exist. But it so happens that a dark and terrible force is sweeping through New York, brutally killing a senator during a political rally. And unfortunately, the American wizard authorities -- led by Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) -- immediately blame Newt, forcing the unworldly animal-collector to try to find the true source of all this mayhem.

""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a movie more for people who love the overall universe of the Harry Potter series than the specific characters. There are a few familiar surnames, a mention of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but for the most part it has a cast of all-new characters, a different setting and a different time period.... which, oddly, makes it easier for noobs to get acquainted with its universe. Since Jacob Kowalski is learning about the wizarding world and how it works, new viewers can come along for the ride.

The movie is a pretty colorful and energetic affair, with lots of wild action scenes where Newt tries to recapture one of his exotic creatures (including a wild ice-skating escapade, and a slow-mo scene involving a cockroach and a teapot), often with some wacky banter (""But why would I have to wear something like this?"" ""Because your skull is susceptible to breakage under immense force!""). And the fantastic beasts of the title are pretty entertaining in their own right -- while they couldn't carry a movie themselves, the weird and exotic creatures (tentacled quadrupeds, the ""Swooping Evil,"" leaf-like little creatures, serpent-birds hatched from silver eggs) add a magical tinge to the New York setting.

But it also has a distinctly dark undertone, both magically and politically. The American wizard civilization is a pretty dark and iron-fisted bunch, apparently not hesitating to immediately kill those it sees as being potential breakers of the Masquerade, and is countered by a bunch of religious fanatics obsessed with killing witches. And the underlying story is about an out-of-control dark magical energy that seems to swoop in and kill without warning, and a dark wizard is interested in controlling it.

It also has a pretty solid cast -- Eddie Redmayne plays Newt's socially-awkward nerdery with the perfect combo of absent-mindedness and fierce compassion, and he's balanced out beautifully by the brittle, desperate Waterston, Alison Sudol as the sweet telepathic Queernie, and especially as the first Muggle main character, wide-eyed, good-hearted Fogle. This character's earnestness and dreams of owning a bakery will melt your heart. The one performance that doesn't quite click is Farrell -- he's not bad, but he feels strangely remote and subdued, though admittedly that might be on purpose.

""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them"" is a solid little period fantasy movie -- fans will enjoy a new perspective on the Harry Potter universe, and newcomers might find it a good gateway. And of course, this is just the start.",1479772800,115,4252,5.09038737446198

4562400,1,B00543R3WG,"This movie is grossly inconsistent with what is in the Harry Potter novels and the original Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them book. What happened in this movie was so huge it would have been taught at Hogwarts. It would have been in the Harry Potter novels. And calling muggles non magi in this movie? Does JK Rowling really expect anyone to swallow that crap? Slight changes from a book to a movie is to be expected, but this is ridiculous. I am stunned that JK Rowling wrote the screenplay for this movie, it is trash. I spent 133 minutes watching this crap which is 133 minutes wasted. This movie is an insult to all the people who love the Harry Potter novles. Clearly JK Rowling has no respect for the true fans of the Harry Potter novels, because if she did, she would not have written this piece of crap. Surely she could have picked somewhere better than America to set this movie. I mean, really? America? The land of hillbilly bogans? I thought JK Rowling had more class than that. After all, she insisted that all the actors in the Harry Potter movies had to be from the UK. This movie is a total waste of money, don't buy it. It doesn't deserve even one star.",1479772800,2,1177,4.378995433789954
4562401,5,B00543R3WG,"This in my opinion starts off stronger than the harry potter films did. It kinda jumps into the action and storyline right away in the movie. Now don't get me wrong, the harry potter movies are one of the best movie franchises ever and remain one of my many favorites. But they don't jump into action until more towards the middle of the movie. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them on the other hand does this right away and remains action filled and interesting from start to end. Another reason why this movie is very good is because it has lots of funny lines. It did surprise me when i seen it, because i wasn't expecting it to be funny.
  Now until you see the movie, you do not know any background to any of these characters or who most of the characters are. Unlike the Harry Potter movies where fans new pretty much every detail on the characters there was to know. And i think it just adds to the interesting aspect of the movie where you have no clue what is going to happen next. And other than the field guide J.K. Rowling wrote in 2001, you don't have any idea about the movie and you don't really have anything to compare it too. So you cant say the book was better than the movie.
  Now this is my new absolute favorite movie and if i could, i would give it 100 stars. I recommend you go watch it in the theater if you haven't already. I did the day it premiered and it is the best movie i seen in the theater this year. And i have seen atleast 7 other movies in the theater this year. I am planning to buy this the second it is available on amazon or dvd. BEST MOVIE EVER!",1479686400,,1591,4.13915857605178
4562402,4,B00543R3WG,"Even J.K. Rowling (""Harry Potter"") isn't above milking a franchise, although she is said to be richer than the Queen of England these days! I suspect creative people just keep creating even when they don't need the cash.

Director David Yates (""Harry Potter"") brings us a fantasy/adventure that places us, once again, in Rowling-land, this time in 1926. Meticulously crafted special effects abound and our familiarity with the Potter saga helps only a bit, as we follow a gentleman into New York's secret world of witches and wizards 70 years before the Potter story starts. An evil force is causing no end of destruction and he wants to help. It's sort of a dark window with eyes.

Part of the enormous cast:

  * Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl"") is Newt Scamander, the aforementioned gentleman traveling to New York. Take a look at his traveling bag: Mary Poppins hasn't a thing on him! Redmayne has devised a stance and a walk that is unique to Newt. It's sort of hollow-chested and listing to the left.
  * Katherine Waterston (""Inherent Vice"") Tina spots Newt as soon as he gets off the boat. It's clear that she knows far more about wizards than most of the New Yorkers who crowd the streets.
  * Dan Fogler (""The Goldbergs"") Cannery worker Kowalski wants to open a bakery but doesn't have any collateral. You know how well that goes over with a banker!
  * Alison Sudol (""Other People's Children"") Queenie loves to cook so she thinks Kowalski is the perfect man. She makes an amazing apple strudel for him.
  * Colin Farrell (""True Detective"") is Percival Graves, a powerful wizard who crosses wands with Newt. Fearsome opponents, indeed!
  * Carmen Ejogo (""Selma"") Seraphina is in charge. The No-Maj (American for Muggles) must have their memories of recent events erased. Period!
  * Ezra Miller (""Suicide Squad"") Credence is part of the cadre of operatives directed by Graves.
  * Samantha Morton (""Max & Ruby"") Mary Lou ""adopts"" children for their own good. Yikes! Her ministry opposes witches and warlocks.
  * Johnny Depp (""Black Mass"") Ha! You'll never recognize his Grindenwald so I'll tell you right now. Yeah, that's a spoiler, but you will STILL be surprised.

As you might expect with a Rowling story, our hold on reality is pretty flimsy but Redmayne manages to find humor in being a stranger in a strange land... Actually, our hold on a plot is equally flimsy. This is mainly an excuse to string together one mind-boggling special effect after another. I sort of liked the first critter that escaped from Newt's grip. It is a sort of duck-billed platypus and is elusive as heck; it LOVES shiny jewelry and valuable coins. Bowtruckle is a green walking-stick bug with attachment issues and the amorous Eruptamus is no shrinking violet!

This is PG-13, so there is no sex (to the Eruptamus's frustration!), a few paltry gunshots, destructive mayhem in the streets but no profanity. The beasts are creative and of course the requisite barroom scene is full of oddball creatures.",1479686400,,2998,4.858267716535433
4562403,4,B00543R3WG,"Theater review.  Possible spoilers.  For those who need more Harry Potter films, how about some prequels, starting with this opening adventure.  David Yates, who successfully directed a quartet of Potter films, returns as J. K. Rowlings visual story teller.  Set in 1926, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a former student at Hogwarts arrives in New York with a satchel full of funny creatures not found in zoos or in the wild.  He wants to get to Arizona in order to release a giant eagle-like Thunderbird to its rightful inhabitant.

When Newt first arrives, a funky looking miniature platypus-like animal called a Niffler escapes.  Hes attracted to shinny things and is hard to catch.  In fact he becomes more annoying than cute for my taste, but attempts to capture him drive the story.  Newt arrives in New York at a time when unexplained acts of destruction are occurring.  Mostly toppling of walls of buildings.  Newts magic wand spinning is eyeballed by Tina (Katherine Waterston), an agent of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.  Caught in the confusion of trying to capture the Niffler is Jacob (Dan Fogler), a baker trying to get a bank loan.  In America, normal humans like Jacob are called a NoMaj rather than Muggle in the U.K., so while he sees things he cant explain his memory will eventually be wiped.

Tina buddies up to Newt and along with Jacob are introduced to her mind-reading sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol).  Jacob and Queenie flirt while the seemingly shy Newt and Tina remain mostly business like.  MCOTUSA is run by Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) and her right hand man, Percival Graves (Colin Farrell).  They are trying to track down who or what is creating the embarrassing destruction that is causing humans to get suspicious.  The NoMajs are being riled up by a witch hater named Mary Lou (an authoritarian Samantha Morton) and her children, the oldest of which is Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller).

In addition to finding out who is causing the chaos in New York, the magicians are also trying to figure out what happened to the evil dark wizard of Europe known as Gellert Grindewald who has gone into hiding.  Then there is the expanding ball of black evil that appears to be magic gone amuck and its capture seems to be the primary focus of Graves.  As far as the special effects, well if youve seen one part of town being destroyed in movies, youve seen them all.  So not much special there.  But, the animals are cute, colorful and hard to deal with.  A favorite scene involves Jacob being the amorous target of a creature that looks like a cross between a rhino and a headlamp.

Needless to say, there is a lot going on here and I will admit to being occasionally confused, but never to the point of disappointment.  Im sure much of the missing pieces will be filled in with the next 4 installments.  Recommended.",1479686400,,2870,4.745454545454545

4562407,5,B00543R3WG,"What a delight, a magical visualization, full of computer animated special effects that somehow seem quite reasonable in a 1920 setting. The nearly century jump back into time will delight many, a special treat for me, a lover of history. It works for this story that is so full of 21st century technology, and its a wonder to behold. Teen to as old as you can get will like this film and each will find something to absolutely adore. Cast is excellent, action if fast, color is brilliant-dazzling but with a dirty tinge that keeps with the retro period needs. It reminded me of many period films that have proved to be great classic works. I expect this to become one to sit on the shelf beside those others.

Much could be said about many of the cast, but I personally have to single out Eddie Redmayne that I fell in like with while watching his acting and hearing his voice in Les Mis. Here he plays Newt Scamander, odd name but interesting role. He bounces off of Katherine Waterston quite well, she also very capable.
Sure, Potter fans will attend and buy the DVD, but I believe this is not a Harry Potter but a Fantastic Beasts a brute and creature of its own, and it will soar on wings like eagles.",1479600000,5,1206,4.408071748878924

4562414,2,B00543R3WG,"Im not quite sure what to make of this newest cinematic expansion of the Wizarding World. In one part, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them feels like a kids movie with its majestic use of magic. In another part, its marketing and rating suggests a teen movie. Yet at the same time, its 1920s setting and cast of adult characters suggests something that would appeal best to whomever grew up with the original Harry Potter adventures. Well one thing is for sure, this new adaptation by the immortal J.K. Rowling is not going to appeal to anybody in the long-run.

If anything, Fantastic Beasts seems the most like an adventure for the teenage girl, as the very casting of Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) will satisfy their fantasies with his boyish charm, along with a half-baked romance between a down-on-his-luck baker and a zesty accountant. But even so, I doubt any high school cheerleaders would be screaming their heads off over a film focused on combining the roaring twenties with a childrens imagination.

Yet true to what the world of Harry Potter has always done, this historical setting is rich with culture. It turns out that unlike the United Kingdom, America has a different word for muggles; No-Mags, and their relationships align much closer to the Salem witch trials than simple racism. The two worlds between the wizards and No-Mags each look as captivating as they do true to the historical era, complete with a scandalous goblin singing at a bar.

Then in comes skimpy old Newt Scamander, played by the same British actor I previously mentioned. He arrives in New York City on the Fort Elizabeth, with a secret mission involving his magical briefcase. Just step inside his case, and you will see an immense world inside: room upon room housing some of the most fascinating beasts you will find. These include leafy little bowtruckles, a money-mad niffler, a mischievous demiguise, and a size-shifting occamy. Kids will love seeing these imaginative designs, but what they're doing in a PG-13 movie I cannot say.

Teens would certainly not care about seeing these beasts anyway, as the special effects used to bring them to life is distractingly awful. Remember in the Harry Potter movies when computer generated imagery was only used when necessary? Now here, it is use in practically every frame for every scenario, even in places where makeup prosthetics would have gotten the job done easy. Think the entire Hobbit trilogy, except without any effort by the visual effects team.

These beasts have ended up under the hands of a No-Mag named Mr. Kowalski who has dreams of starting his own bakery. Yet he mistakenly lets the case open, and several of the beasts lose into the city. Now Newt has to bring him as a witness to protect his innocence from the National Astute of Secrecy, or else face serious criminal penalty for exposing the wizarding community to the No-Mags.

There are points here and there that reveal how a great movie could have been made, but for the greater portion, the blank performances by the majority of the cast send a preposterous message that says the law and government should not control us.  If you ask me, these negative, limiting depictions of political authorities is way too common in our movie theaters, and our leaders deserve better treatment. Even worse, this predictable story is ruined all the more by a plot twist that adds nothing; literally nothing to the story.

Yet it doesnt stop there. After a snore-inducing climax, the final moments try to emotionally manipulate you as if the filmmakers felt that they earned it somehowthey didnt. Then they of course have to leave the final frame open for a sequel which I obviously will not be looking forward to.

If you think that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dream come true for your inner witch or wizard, I hate to break it to you: look elsewhere. This attempt at keeping the franchise alive and fresh is only making it age all the more, and its attempted relational bonds between America and England does not feel any stronger either. I could really use a great motion picture that makes us people feel united in spite of differences in a world that wants us to feel otherwise, and this does not accomplish that.",1479513600,2,4273,4.802721088435374
4562415,3,B00543R3WG,"Filled with wonderful special effects, memorable beasts and some excellent casting, the movie still manages to disappoint slightly due to an immature script and a wandering feeling. When the movie tries to transition away from the presentation of Newt's interesting companions to the movie's central dilemma, I found myself completely indifferent to the outcome, and, indeed, wished the movie had concentrated more on Newt's adventures to find/protect the beasts (in fact, the title of the film appears inappropriate: the movie really has nothing to do with finding fantastic beasts, since the beasts have already been found by the time the movie begins). Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing for Potter fans--but I will probably not pay to see future installments in the theatre on opening weekend.

Generally, I was left with the impression that wonderful novelists do not necessarily make wonderful screenwriters, and that this movie would have been much more interesting had it benefited from more development. Having seen this, it is extremely difficult to imagine that there are four more films in the works base on this debut.",1479513600,6,1135,5.305555555555555
4562416,4,B00543R3WG,"Harry Potter fans will of course devour this and it is clearly designed to appeal to this group. For those others of us there is still a lot to like about Fantastic Beasts. It is visually spectacular; the beasts themselves, the magic, the marvelous recreation of New York 1926 - all of this works perfectly and ensures a thrilling treat. Redmayne is classically the eccentric, lovable hero, both bumbling and brilliant. The film is also a fine morality tale about conservation and respect for all creatures. That said, there are some problematic elements. The film rightly raises questions of power and responsibility, but does little to engage with these. It does seem to endorse a hierarchical order based on birth and the concentration of power in the hands of a small, answerable to no-one elite. Rowling's plotting is at times random and the story's 'resolution' is too glib. Notions of good and evil are alarmingly simplistic. The use of magic is bizarrely inconsistent. But this is the Potter universe, with its rules and protocols understood and viewers who are comfortable in this world will find much to enjoy. Indeed, Newt Scamander is a worthy rival to Harry and his colleagues and away from the stifling confines of the Potter stories, there is a refreshing panache about this film that appeals to a wider audience. At same time, viewers who enjoyed Dr Strange are likely to find Fantastic Beasts engaging, even comparable, but ultimately lightweight.

Eccentric magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) misplaces an enchanted suitcase in 1920s New York. An extremely profitable franchise is unleashed.

What did I think?

Hey, you guys like Harry Potter? Then Ive got good news: Fantastic Beasts is the worthy spin-off that you're going to be really into for the next ten years or so. While its darker than the original films, its packed with subtle little nods to them that fans will adore, and the story (though somewhat complicated) is good enough to stand alone. Its tremendous fun to see the wizarding world through a 1920s lens  magical speakeasy, anyone?  and the inhabitants of Scamanders Pokeball-meets-TARDIS suitcase are just as fantastic as advertised.

4562419,5,B00543R3WG,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
 Harry Potter does not appear in this film of magic and mayhem.  His birth happens some 70 years after the events shown in 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'.  We are instructed that this is not a prequel to the Potter films but rather a separate story-stories rather as the producers plan five films in this run.  Oh boy.  I loved the Potter films and considered them to be excellent movie fare-still do for that matter.
 And director David Yates handled the last four Potter movies, so he knows what works in this magical universe.  He also has already been tapped to direct all five of the Fantastic films.  In terms of box office, he has one of the most successful runs ever with an average of $280 million including every film he has directed.
 First time script writer J.K. Rowling comes with high expectations.  She of course wrote the original Potter books as well as 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'.  As the inventor of the magical world we can count on her to translate her own vision to the big screen, perhaps better than anyone else could.  She, by the way, became the first author in the history of the world to become a billionaire from her writing, proving that people like her stuff.
 London born Oscar nominee and Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays the leading man, Newt Scamander.  Oddly enough he tried for a role in the 2002 film 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' but after reading a single line was dismissed.
 Also appearing are Colin Farrell in a major supporting role and the always lively  Johnny Depp in a brief cameo.  John Voight and Ron Perlman also appear.  Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol play sisters who help New Scamander round up his beasts.  Dan Fogler plays a non-magical baker who also helps out.
 In the story Newt Scamder (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York City after girdling the globe in a quest to find and record the said Fantastic Beasts.  He is an ecologist of sorts.  Misadventure allows some of the very dangerous magical critters to get loose among the good folk of NY City.  But writer Rowling will not let things go so simply.  We have a much more dangerous sub story that involves very sinister forces indeed.
 We have lots of magic, some wizard duels and a little romance along with everything else.  This four saw blade film carries a mild PG-13 rating and runs for a good long two hours and13 minutes.  With a budget of $180 million the producers expect 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'  people all around the world to buy lots of tickets, and they surely will.
 Historical movie note- In the 2004 film 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' Harry Potter has a magical map.  On the map is inscribed the name Newt Samander.  How about that?  Rowling plays the long game.",1479427200,46,2792,4.589068825910931
4562420,4,B00543R3WG,"The film is magical and ""Fantastic"" despite being over-stuffed and draggy with not so great pacing. The chemistry between Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol is what totally won me over though.
Fogler who usually plays the same loud mouth friend in comedies, really shines here as a muggle dragged into the magical world. However Sudol's Queenie who can read minds probably gives the most magical performance in the movie.
Anyone whining that the film isn't exactly what they wanted, I don't understand. The film is a magical delight, what else did you expect it to be ? Not everything worked together I admit though. Some characters, like the Jon Voight one  felt like they were shoved into the story for no good reason. Same with the subplot of Colin Farrell looking for someone special with powers.
None of the heroes will make you forget Harry, Hermione or Ron but they were likeable and to me the heart of the movie. Even more so than the charm of Eddie Redmayne looking for cute magical creatures that escaped. The moments between Fogler and Sudol in the end is what made me tear up and even now writing about it lol. I really loved that relationship.",1479427200,2,1149,4.6600985221674875

I think if you're buying this for kids it might be a good idea to write on each disc with permanent marker their chronological number ex: sorcerers stone =1, chamber of secrets =2 etc. this would only benefit young children who may get confused by all the DVD's looking exactly the same and the only hint to the order is either knowing the order (which I'm sure we all do) or reading the back of the case.

After the piracy warnings and what not, the movie started up and it was going perfectly fine until a part towards the end when the screen suddenly started cracking and splitting everywhere and eventually crashed?? The movie started skipping and there were large green, purple, blue pixels popping up everywhere and the sound cut off and it just stopped playing completely. I tried cleaning the disc, restarting it, fast-forwarding, and even chapter selecting to the same part and even after but it either wouldn't start and would look absolutely broken and distorted or it would start, crack, split, and not play any sound and continue to skip parts until it completely froze into a distorted mess. I gave up because eventually it just wouldn't load and would show a distorted red piracy screen that wasn't even complete and it made me believe that the collection I bought might actually be an amazingly pirated copy of the real deal. Not sure what to do next but its very unfortunate since I was excited and looking forward to watching all of the movies. My nephew, who was watching with me, was disappointed as well.

4562526,5,B00543R3WG,"This review refers to the Hogwarts Collection (31 DVD's, Blu Ray discs, and 3D Blu Ray discs in a long flat book with a photograph of an older Daniel Radcliffe surrounded by the Battle of Hogwarts in the back.

We've been Potter-heads at home for a few years (though more the movies than the books so far).  For the moment, this is the definitive super-genius edition of the 8-film series.  The Blu Ray editions of the movies are all stunning and in good sound.  The first two movies offer the option of viewing the movie as an extended cut, with deleted scenes restored into the sequence of the film.

For those who have been wondering, the ABC Family network acquired broadcast rights to the movies, and have offered all the movies with deleted scenes put back into the sequence.  Unfortunately, those extended cuts cannot be recreated on these Blu Ray discs.  You can see the deleted scenes separately, but not as a single continuity.  Which is a shame, because I've found those scenes do add all manner of shading and nuance to a story that gets more and more compactly told as Rowling's books got bigger and bigger.

The extras are extraordinary.  A multi-hour documentary series called ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" broadcast on Bravo once or twice, and every episode is available in this set.  And on top of that, there are also other featurettes (some of which do also recycle similar interview and clip bits) and separate making of and extra DVD's.

So for someone like me, who tends to get super-genius editions of my favorite movies, this was the only choice.  Until, of course, somebody issues the extended cuts (reminding me of a favorite line from ""Men in Black:"" ""Now I have to buy the White Album all over again."")",1475712000,3,1737,4.6743421052631575

It happens during the platform scene - always at the same spots. Bummer! Never been played before and just checked to find it is in pristine condition on the back (no evidence of specks of dust or scratches) so I have to attribute it to the way it was mass produced.

That reviewer was correct! If you are just wanting the movies without the extras, there is another set that has Hogwarts on the front of it. That set does not include any movie extras. The Sorcerers Stone is called The Philosophers Stone, but aside from that, this is the set to get if you are an avid Harry Potter fan and want to know all about what went on behind the scenes, more about Jo Rowling while in the process of writing the books, and more.  I read that there had been a price difference at one time between the two dvd sets, but I did not seem to see that much of a difference when I purchased my set.",1474502400,,811,4.10062893081761

The ride is over 10 hours long, so having a few movies to play along the way helped fill some of that time.  I spent a few nights prior to us leaving, looking on Amazon for a full set of Harry Potter DVDs (I did not purchase the blue-ray discs).  After a comparing prices and quality, I decided to purchase this set.  The price cannot be beat.  That said, I have purchased DVD sets here on Amazon before, and some sets I found that they were of poor quality.

Here this Harry Potter set includes all 8 movies...and the price is amazing.  Now the quality...top notch!  Our daughter watched these movies without any issues.  No skips, no problems.  Honestly, if these movies gave us any trouble I would have been nuts the whole drive.  Our daughter is not shy about letting us know if the DVD's are acting up.  We now have the entire set and they didn't break the bank.  A wonderful bang for your buck!",1473984000,5,1003,4.32258064516129

As for the movies themselves, seen one after the other they let the viewer see the progression through the years.

The movies have enduring themes of the value of friendship, finding courage when needed, and standing up to wrongdoers. They are well worth watching more than once.",1473379200,,524,4.695652173913044

4562615,3,B00543R3WG,Ugh. Low stars is for the disks themselves. Movies are great themselves. I have no clue if the disks or my DVD player or stupid overzealous copy protection are the culprit. But I can not get some of these disks to play. I have to jump through a lot of hoops. Usually turn the player on and off a couple times. Then I can almost never choose Play Movie on the menu screen. But I can usually go to Choose scene and get it to play from there. Very frustrating. I have a newer Samsung BD-J6300 Blu Ray Player.,1473206400,,505,4.111111111111111

Mind you, this review is not for the Bluray format,  this is for the DVD format.  No skips or any other problems.  Also, bear in mind that this set is also not a collector's item.  This is a bare bones set, it doesn't include any bonus content so if you want that, look elsewhere.  This includes all eight theatrical versions of the movies, that's all.

I could press pop up menu to get to scene selections though. None of these problems were the fault of the seller. The manufacturer was just lazy.",1473120000,,447,4.149425287356322
4562619,2,B00543R3WG,"Here is my biggest problem with this product.  It is NOT as described.  This was not the sellers fault.  The manufacturer claims that the movies are the ""theatrical version.""  The ARE NOT!!!  They are missing several scenes from the movie version.  I had this same problem when I bought the original blu ray when it came out.  I wrote to Warner Brothers & they stated that nowhere on the movie does it claim to be the ""theatrical version.""  Apparently this is a common practice with movie-makers.  The DVD/Blu rays have scenes removed from them, which sucks, but okay.  This one actually claimed to be the Theatrical version & is not.  I do like the additional features & packaging, however I feel like I was hoodwinked.

I've watched all DVDs and although they don't have any graphics on them (not a big deal to me) there are no scratches, skips or imperfections. I think 2-3 discs have special features but the majority do not. So if that's what you are looking for this isn't the set for you.

They come in one case and you can flip through the DVDs like a book. A great space saver.

4562721,5,B00543R3WG,"I love the Potter movies and I've been meaning to update my old full screen DVD collection of the movies to some good Blu Rays. When i saw there were new covers and disks coming out I of course waited for weeks so I could specifically order it. When this boxed set originally came out it was only available in the UK, so I had to order it from there. It took about two weeks to come, and in that time it became available on the US amazon site. What's funny is even after international shipping, the cost of this exact same boxed set was much cheaper off the Amazon.co.uk site. (It was approximately $57 american dollars). The only reason to pay the $84 for this boxed set on this version of the site is if you want it in two days, otherwise save yourself some money and order it off of amazons UK sister site.

Anyway, onto the actual set. The boxed set is super nice, and comes in a nice box (with a cheapie cardboard cover to keep the DVD sleeves in) with several book like cardboard sleeves inside that contain the movies and bonus disks. The movies are all very uniform (something I LOVE). If you're not careful it's easy for the movies to slip out of the cardboard sleeves though, but as long as you don't hang them upside down you should be fine.

The set also comes with Ultraviolet copies, but I had trouble redeeming them because of territory issues and had to contact customer service to have them override the issue and have them put the movies directly in my Ultraviolet library.",1470787200,172,1491,4.359712230215828

PARTS 1 and 2 almost single handedly destroy this series.  The effects are cheap looking, like a BBC TV show, the story is dragging and very kiddy.  It just doesn't appeal much to those who are wondering why the rest of the world loves this series.  However, I always tell everyone to get those out of the way (yes watch them) and parts 3 and up really start to ramp up the series.  This collection is superb, even better when you have a high end TV that can accurately reproduce the darker scenes without losing quality.  As a bluray, 5 STARS.

4562744,4,B00543R3WG,"This would be perfect save there is no real menu system on the discs, I mean when you insert them, they just start the movie- of course, could just be something the Xbox One does, but I had to top menu and search for even the most basic settings. Still, they all play nicely and you can't wrong if you love Hermoine Granger - I mean Harry Potter, of course. If I had to do it over again, I would have gotten the multiformat set instead as I would like to watch them in my van late at night with Allison and Ellie - although I could use the PS3 on the van's RCA interface. It's cozy and the screen in small but it's cozy and being locked in a van with the people you love sounds great until someone has to go to the bathroom.
Outside of the weird menu UI - it is more compact than juggling multiple cases and memorabilia- unless you like showing off your elder wand and butter beer stein between disks. Then,by all means, get robed up and go around exclaim spells and picking on house elfs...or not. Ellie says that we should make the elves polka-dot socks to wear- I suspect she knows that Allison is secretly annoyed by the idea of polka dots socks though. I assure them both Hermoine wouldn't hear of any such foolishness. I would have preferred that she and Harry could have had the relationship instead though but I respect that the story writes itself.",1470268800,,1357,4.284046692607004

4562758,1,B00543R3WG,"This is the 2nd time I have written this review. For some reason it keeps disappearing?  I was so excited when I found the Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection on Amazon.com yesterday that I ordered it with next day shipping. I had been looking for the 8 part series ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" for years but did not want to pay the $1100 for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-Wizard-s-Collection-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B007FSEAHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter Wizard's Collection (Blu-ray / DVD Combo)</a>. Then when I read the first line of the product description which clearly stated that ""This comprehensive 31-disc collection contains all eight Harry Potter movies on Blu-ray, DVD and UltraViolet"" it was a no brainer and well worth the $119. I received my package via FedEx this morning, July 30th 2016, and quickly opened the box. Imagine my surprise when the coupon code for the digital download had expired on March 4th 2016. Amazon should know that the coupon has expired and updated their product description. Now I will have to watching these movies with my family tied to my television and blu-ray player instead of on our devices when we want. So, now I will have to spend another $59.99 to purchase the digital versions of these movies from iTunes. Amazon needs to take some responsibility here and make sure that there product descriptions are accurate. This product was sold by and shipped by Amazon not a 3rd party. I am not quite sure why the manufacturer puts a time limit on the digital download versions. It is clearly marked all over the packaging material that the digital down load is included. Nowhere on the outside of the package does it state that you have to purchase the product and redeem the download code by March 4th 2016. I feel that this is misleading and false advertising.",1469836800,9,1883,5.194078947368421

4562826,4,B00543R3WG,We were surprised by the UK titleing of The Philosopher's Stone and had a bit of difficulty playing one of the disks.  All in all a great buy and we've already played the films so many times that we feel we've easily recouped our investment many times over.,1467763200,,257,4.354166666666667

4562828,1,B00543R3WG,"To be clear, I am rating the 8 film Blu-ray box with only the 8 movies and no extras. It is obvious to me that this isn't a genuine box set but rather a ""top quality"" boot-leg. I'll list the issues I have with this set.
1. ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is labeled ""DISC 1"" - As in there should have been more discs. I think what this boot-leg copy did was steal the artwork from the larger, more complete collection.
2. There are no menus or set-up options on the movies, another sign that this set is illegitimate.
3. While the first 7 movies played fine without a hitch, the last movie didn't play at all. It was stuck in a loading ""loop"" when inserted into my player. There was no damage or scratches on the disc. I did clean it but alas, it would not play. I would normally accept the first two problems as I am not particularly fastidious with these sorts of things. However, I do not believe that any legitimate box set would experience these problems. If you read the other one star reviews you will see similar if not worse problems. Hopefully you are smarter than I was before purchasing this set and I - along with the other one star reviews - can save you some heart-ache.",1467676800,5,1177,4.2825112107623315
4562829,1,B00543R3WG,"DO NOT BUY! These are not BluRay discs they are poorly made copies of standard DVDs repackaged as a box set. Some solid indicators;
1. Movie 6 is broken up into two discs
2. picture quality is worse than basic cable
3. there are no menus on any of the discs
4. some discs are wide screen, some are not.
5. disc 7.2 does not even play.
6. cover art is all over the place and poorly printed.

4562919,5,B00543R3WG,"I grew up with Harry Potter. I bought the first book in 5th grade, expecting it to be just a casual read. But from the time the Hogwarts Express left London, I was already hooked. This set provides me an ""alternate reality,"" if you will, of how Harry Potter could look, versus how it looked in my mind while reading. The visuals are fantastic, special effects wonderful, and the scoring...oh the scores! Films just aren't done this way any more. If you ask me, years 1 and 2 were among the last well scored films produced.
This set is of wonderful quality. For the price, I was expecting a flimsy cardboard box, but was surprised to find it's very thick. An album slides out the side, which holds the disks. Each turn of a page holds a different year, years 1-7. Even the inside of the album is beautiful, decorated with stills from the films.
There are no ""extras,"" like promotional items. This is more of a bare bones set. For the price, I say ""well done!"" For those who just want the films and some extra material, this is for you. Any absolute die hard Potter fans out there who want all the bells and whistles, this might not suit you, spring for a more expensive set.",1464825600,,1173,4.385321100917431

Instead of Soccerers Stone is Philosophers Stone. (I think it's way cool) HOWEVER, I was finally able to get to Deathly Hallows and NEITHER work. I'm pretty disappointed as the Deathly Hallows is my favorite one. I did not have any issues with any of the other discs just DH. Overall I'm pretty happy with them just bummed I don't have the last ones.",1464566400,,521,4.381443298969073

4562932,5,B00543R3WG,"Ok so I need to do a little of admitting to the world. I am a complete utter nerd and I am proud of it. I was introduced to the wonderful world of Hogwarts years and years ago and I have never stopped. I have dreamed of being a wizard and all the cool things that I could do if I was ever allowed in that world. But since I know that is never gonna happen this is going to be the closest that I am ever going to get to being a student at Hogwarts and being best friends with Ron and Hermoine.

  I love all these movies and have seen them all in the movie theater ( some more than once.) So when me and my husband have a little bit of time to spare we are usually spending it watching Harry and his friends battle Voldemort or as most call his he who shall not be named. We loved to travel through all the years that Harry and his friends have had all these adventures and get lost in all of it. Did I mention that my husband is as much of a nerd as I am? This box set has already been watched twice since we got it and soon it will be on time 3. These movies make me and my beloved husband run through all the gambit of emotion, including anger, sadness and happiness. We are still trying to figure out what we did before we bought this box set. Now onto more Harry Potter.

  I purchased this item at full price for my own personal use. The opinions expressed in the review are mine and mine alone. Nobody or nothing has influenced my opinion. I in no way shape or form have a relationship with this seller.",1464480000,,1509,3.9473684210526314
4562933,4,B00543R3WG,"I purchased the 8 disc set and it's very obvious that the last 3 movies (half blood prince and deathly hallows 1&2) are from their own sets. Out of the 8 movies they're the only ones with ads before the movie and the discs themselves all say ""movie"" on them. Half blood prince actually says ""disc 1 movie"" which tells me there's a disc 2 somewhere with special features or something like that. In the end I don't mind cause I mostly wanted the movies, just something to note.
Also, my deathly hallows part 2 movie won't play on my ps4 unless I disconnect the internet from it which is annoying but not the end of the world.",1464393600,,623,4.288135593220339

4562939,3,B00543R3WG,"The case the discs arrive in do not fully support the discs themselves so buyer beware. The movies pop off the plastic case with no manipulation and you ultimately end up with a book of blu ray discs sliding around as all 8 movies come in one case, like a flip book (one in front, one in back, then another case etc.) The movies play fine, blu ray offers a much clearer image than the DVDs but I really was peeved by the way they are sold so I have since put all of my blu ray discs into my old HP DVD individual cases. I understood they would be sold together in one book but that doesnt mean the effort can't be made to ensure the movies stay put while in said book.

4562943,5,B00543R3WG,"An excellent compilation of all the movies. It's the British version, region free, works perfectly on my American PS3. Not a lot of special features until the last movie, but I never cared for them. Last time I checked, its more affordable than the American compilation. Great if you only want the movies. Individually, the movies aren't that great. However, marathon watching is a treat, get to see the kids age before your eyes and you immediately get all the callbacks to previous entries. If you watched them in theaters, it was probably years between entries so you might have missed a lot of callbacks and plot points.

If you didn't care for special features, this is the greatest bang for your buck.",1464220800,,707,4.747967479674797

4563021,4,B00543R3WG,"Not the nicest 'collector'-type packaging, but that's a minor issue.  The individual cases hold two discs each, and seem to have decent center grips to prevent the discs from getting dislodged and sliding around.  Cases are the traditionally shorter/smaller Blue-Ray size which also helps prevent excessive movement inside.  Discs seem to be good quality - though I've only owned this set a short while.  And, of course, the movies themselves are.... well.... Harry Potter.  Of course they are amazing (though the books are MUCH better) :)",1462147200,,539,5.22093023255814

Until that time I had just been watching them when on occasion they came on tv. I waited until all the movies had come out and then in January I bought this set. I started watching them and immediately noticed something was off. Not even halfway through the first movie I noticed some scenes had been cut/edited out of these movies. For example, in the first movie before Harry gets his first letter from Hogwarts the scene where Dudley is trying on his new school uniform had been completely taken out. I am a little disappointed that I paid for these movies not knowing that...",1462060800,,698,4.376923076923077

4563124,3,B00543R3WG,"I really love the books and movies so I decided that I would buy the movies in the set. While there in nothing wrong with packaging or anything along those lines, there is definitely an issue with the voice track lining up with the mouths of the actors as they speak. There was a bit of a delay so they would start speaking but their voices didn't start for a moment. I almost feel as though I am watching a movie on mute and listening to an audio track at the same time. I know that sounds weird but that's the only way I can describe that. If I were rating the actual plot of the movie it would be 5-stars but that really wouldn't help anyone contemplating purchasing this.

While I would love a better copy it really isn't worth the time to send it back, especially if they are using our returns as against your standing with amazon, as I just read they are doing - regardless if your returns are for defective materials etc. For the money you spend on the Blu-ray I definitely think that this problem should be fixed.

The packaging is compact which I appreciate for storage reasons.  I don't usually look at all the extras anyway.  What I don't like, and why I gave it only 4 stars, was that all of the information about each disc is underneath the disc and clear plastic packaging - description, time duration, etc.",1459209600,,600,4.757281553398058

Both times we watched all of the movies, but at the exact same spot on the 7th disc, the video stopped just before the battle at Hogwarts. And both times we got a weird customs-type of form that popped up from India or somewhere. We could skip further on in the video and it would start playing correctly again. We really want this set in our collection, and I was hoping this set would do the job for us as it was the least expensive full set with extras. But, I guess we'll have to try another one and see if it works. Part of me wonders if they sent us the same set we sent back again, but I don't know how that could have happened.

4563149,5,B00543R3WG,"Best Movie Collection EVER!!! At least, that is what my son thinks.

Let me set the scene in my household. I have a 6 year old son that gets so wrapped up in things that it becomes his reality. I love how this kids imagination just runs wild with whatever it is he gets into. He loves Star Wars, Legos, Ninja Turtles, Transformers, etc etc etc, basically all things that a young boy would just love.

I purchased this movie set for my wife for a Christmas gift because she loved the books and the movies (truth be told, so do I). I thought that it would be a fun thing for us to have for nights when the kids go to bed early, something fun for us to cuddle up with each other on the couch and enjoy. What I didn't realize is how it would transform my son's world into a world of magic, spells, and wands.

My wife showed the first movie to our 3 older kids (9 year old daughter who has read all of the books, 6 year old son, and ~3 year old daughter) one day during the Christmas break after they had finished their chores. My daughter knew what to expect b/c she has read the whole series, but my son was just captivated. He loved everything about the movie and wanted to watch more. The kids ended up watching the whole series (minus a few scary parts when we had them cover their eyes) over the course of the next week. Since that time, my son has wanted to do nothing but watch, read, and play Harry Potter. I am reading the books to him each night before bed and we are just finishing up the 3rd book. He purchased a couple of Harry Potter Lego sets with money that he earned doing chores. We even ended up buying a couple of replica wands for each of the kids for Valentine's Day gifts.

I love how wrapped up into this world he has become. He will go outside after school and has now convinced several of the neighborhood kids to play Harry Potter. They all have wands, run around casting spells at each other. They have a fantastic time doing it and it is all in good fun. The other day, my almost 3 year old started casting spells at me. She only knows one spell, the Avada Kedavra spell, which of course is the death or killing spell. She can't quite say it right, but it is the cutest thing in the world to hear her yelling spells at me or her brother just so that she can play along too.

I love this movie set too, but not just because they are good movies. I really love how much they have opened up the minds of my kids and helped them to see the joy of books and using their imaginations to play. My daughter loved this book series and she has now started into other series of books. My son tries to read the books on his own, and he is getting much better at reading because he is so focused on it. It also is fun to go down into his room at night and read with him, and have him want to listen and spend time with me. I couldn't be more pleased and thankful to own these movies now. I can't recommend this series more to anyone that has kids and wants to find ways to spark creativity, curiosity, and even motivate those kids to want to read.",1458864000,,3060,4.076411960132891

4563168,2,B00543R3WG,"I believed the other reviewers when they said Blue Ray discs produced for the British market would play fine on U.S. players.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!  The discs skipped and jumped, stopped and stuck, and were entirely unwatchable.  When they got stuck, the player was unresponsive to the remote and nothing short of turning it off at the player and restarting would even allow me to eject the disc.  Also, the discs do not have the scene selection menu so you have no way except fast forward to go back to where the problem started and see if you can continue the movie.  This happened over and over again.  The discs were not dirty, the player was not dirty, and there were no scratches or marks on the discs.  They just would not play.  I will not buy Blue Ray discs produced for the British market ever again.  If the set you are contemplating has the first movie titled ""Philosopher's Stone"", it was produced for the British market.  If you have a U.S. player, the set you want should have the first movie titled ""Sorcerer's Stone"" - unless you enjoy screaming and cursing when your movies stop or skip in the middle of a crucial scene and you can't get them restarted again without 10 minutes of fiddling only to find there is no menu to take you to where you left off.",1458432000,,1269,4.407725321888412

The special feature menus on the discs are difficult for me to navigate.

The price is great, but the last movie would skip 20 to 30 seconds ahead sometimes and occasionally freeze for a few moments. Also, the image quality on these is not true blu Ray quality. Image blur and artifacts can be seen in dark objects on screen. Average bit rate for these copies of the movies is 15 to 18mbps whereas real blu Ray will be between 24 to 30mbps and in some cases even more. I do not recommend anyone to buy these.

It might have something to do with the way the movies were filmed or by the fact that these are actually meant to be sold in the UK, but it annoyed me a little bit.

4563226,1,B00543R3WG,Was super excited to relieve this complete collection on Blu-ray. Unfortunately I was immediately disappointed with the audio. It's almost impossible to hear.

4563230,1,B00543R3WG,"First off, I want to start off by saying these movies are incredible, but the product itself is what I am dissatisfied with. I appreciate the amount of extras included with the collection. However I bought this set brand new and several of discs already had scratches on them. I don't think this is a fault to the seller so much as to the actual packaging itself.

Rather than going with the preferable and likely cheaper option of putting them in a plastic blu ray case like the other variation of the collection, they decided to put them in these terrible paper slits. Now with my other blu rays that are in similar slits, like the Alien Anthology or the Steven Spielberg collection, they're pretty easy to get out. But with this collection when you pull the discs out you, every time you try to get them out, the bottom of the disc cant help, but be damaged by the top part of the slit keeping them in. With those other collections, the discs came out the side without the use of a guard and had an outer case for keeping them in.

It's easy to see the purpose of the tops of the slits, they're there to keep the discs from falling out. Great idea, but terrible execution. And because there's not much room to pull the disc out, you could potentially scratch and smear the bottom part of the disc just getting them out. If you do think about buying this particular collection, I'd recommend buying a couple Viva elite blu ray cases to put the actual discs in, that way they don't get damaged every time you want to watch the films. Even though it will damage the book, I would just cut the tops of those blu ray slits, make it easier to gently slide the disc out and place it in the safer blu ray cases. Plus the book is just too flimsy and a complete pain in the ass for getting out to watch movies. There isn't any interesting artwork on the inside to even justify such ridiculous packaging. I'm giving this package a one star review simply because the packaging only hurts the movies you intend to watch and there's no justification for it's large size.
Why not have an option for a collection with ultimate edition blu rays and bonus disc and remove the DVDs? You could have a much smaller book that way and could do the disc slits similar to the collections I mentioned earlier (maybe not the best either, but a HUGE improvement over this). I know there's another collection in a standard blu ray casing, but it doesn't come with all the extras so that's why I'm complaining. I bought this one for the bonus material and extended cuts of the first two films.",1457222400,3,2566,4.388655462184874

This DVD set had been sitting on my amazon wish list for quite a while, so when it was on sale for black Friday, I jumped at the chance to snag this set at a cheaper price. The box set is small, not bulky, so it fits nicely on my DVD shelf. I ordered this set along with a few other items and my package never arrived, although amazon said it was delivered (I think it was stolen from my mail). I had never had a package not arrive before so I waited a few extra days and contacted the seller. They immediately sent out a new one, free of charge, with expedited shipping! Such great customer service!  The movies came well before Christmas (which I was hoping for) and were a big hit with my family.

Our dvd copies are scratched and no longer play without skipping so I knew I wanted to replace them with blu-ray discs. This was the cheapest option. All the movies play. Our cardboard box was a little roughed up on a corner but we don't mind. The cardboard box is very thin though. The case is one big thick case and you open it up to flip through the discs. I like that they are not stacked. All discs looked new. The only thing that I found odd was that they are not a matching set. It looks kinda like they were each taken from the original release design and just combined into a set which you can see by the pictures.

4563354,1,B00543R3WG,"1. Most movies adapted from novels still do a pretty good job conveying the plot, where a newcomer (who's never read the book) will be able to understand everything going on. Not so with the Harry Potter films. If you've never read any of the books, you'll be scratching your head most of the time and will not understand much of what is happening.

2. The films do a very poor job re-creating the magic found in the novels. I find that the acting is juvenile & hammy, and most of the films speed through at a tremendous pace. There's no way you can put a novel, like Goblet of Fire, into a two and a half hour movie, it's not possible, and it just doesn't work, and Goblet of Fire (the movie) was simply atrocious.

3. All the changes made in the movies are for the worse, pretty much every single one. Question is, why did they ever make this into a movie franchise? A 7 season TV show would have been more fitting and would have had more time to capture all the wonderful nuances in the Harry Potter universe. Of course they were after the money a movie franchise would bring, understandable but still disappointing from a fan of the book's perspective.

I absolutely detest these films, I could only make it up to Order of the Phoenix before I couldn't bare watching them anymore. I loved the book series so much and ordered the blu-ray movie set, thinking it would be cool to see it all unfold on film, but goodness I was very wrong.

I have seen many great movie adaptations from novels, but the Harry Potter franchise is definitely not one of them!",1455235200,,1555,4.370242214532872

This is the version that is stamped Ireland on the back.  We will be buying the other (more expensive) set.

Also, this appears to be a UK version (thus the Ireland stamp)...many (good) scenes we saw in US versions are missing!!

It is worth noting that it has the UK markings--Philosopher's Stone, Irish Cinema Council rating for ages 12+ (poor Book One Harry is too young to watch his own movie lol). It does NOT mention a region anywhere on the packaging, it was fulfilled by Amazon US, and I was worried. Rest assured, if it won't play, Amazon will replace it with one that will. But mine played just fine, in a US BluRay player set for Region 1.

As a fan of the original title of the book (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) I was delighted to get the edition of the movie with the actual title.  The ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was a nonsense title for American audiences for the book and the movie.

4563497,5,B00543R3WG,"I'm happy with this purchase despite several reviews pointing out the negative qualities. It was a great price and exactly what I expected to pay for. I like the compact and sleek design of this Blu-ray disc set. The box sleeve is standard as is the case, so there were no surprises. The only hiccup is that the disc trays aren't the greatest quality, but I personally take care of my movies and do not just toss them back into the cases after viewing. Although I can see the trays wearing down or potentially breaking over time, I appreciate the compactness of the box.

Being a Harry Potter fan, I also own each individual movie in DVD format, so the need to get one the other Blu-ray disc sets with all the possible extras was not a priority. This set still had many bonus features and deleted scenes which were enjoyable.

If all your after is the movie to watch in great quality and can be stored with ease, this is for you. If you are looking for more of the collectors route, there are others out there but not at this price point.",1453680000,,1038,4.345360824742268

Let's make this clear for you guys..

In the UK, they use Philosopher's Stone, while in the US, they use Sorcerer's Stone.

4563519,4,B00543R3WG,"Obtaining a good set of this Harry Potter Blu-ray collection did not go smoothly at first. I initially bought the 2011 version of the 8-film collection, as that was the cheapest, but seemed mostly the same as the 2013 version. I didn't check all the discs, but there was a glitch on the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 disc where the movie would freeze at the same point in time, making it impossible to watch several minutes of the movie. I returned that set for the slightly more expensive 2013 8-film set (about $10 more), and while I didn't watch Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 all over again, I checked that same part of the movie and found that it did not have the same issue. Watched a couple of the other earlier movies and they didn't have any issues.

Other than that one issue and the hassle of having to return a set just to buy another set, I also found trying to figure out the differences in the collections to be very confusing.  At this point I would definitely recommend the 2013 version over the 2011 version if you're going 8 disc version over the 11 disc version (which I haven't tried).",1453507200,,1091,4.396039603960396

Put in Prisoner of Azkaban and it just started playing. The case indicates that there are the normal 'special features' included with disc, but lo-and-behold, there were no extras--not even a menu! I would definitely say that these are bootleg copies -- Not worth the money. I would strongly suggest that people purchase the more expensive, all-in-one case version of this collection. Not to mention that the quality was not that of a true blu-ray.

Seems to be a problem that other people are having as well. Warner Bros. would not be sending out cases that indicate something that is not there (i.e. false advertising) nor would they be shipping out terrible quality movies.

Luckily Santa saw fit to upgrade us to the BlueRay set. Thanks Santa!
As huge fans of the movies and books these will get a lot of watching. The price is right for all the movies. It is a set to watch and enjoy.
Fans will enjoy the magic and mystery. As the movies get darker as they progress in theme there is still a sense of wonder and magic on them. The sets and cinematography cannot be denied.
The 3 main young cast members earned their acting chops as they grew older in each subsequent movie. They were blessed to work alongside some amazing actors to learn from. RIP Alan Rickman!
The characters are great with so much depth to them.
While the movies are fantastic I strongly recommend the books. They are even better.

4563615,5,B00543R3WG,"Being a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, I knew that I wanted to have a collection of the films to own. So, imagine my surprise when I found this boxed set for a fairly reasonable price! I purchased it and it came earlier than I had anticipated, just in time for me and my roommate to begin rewatching the films....right before Alan Rickman's untimely death.

So far, the discs work like a charm and the box is in great condition. I was a little confused at first because each case save the last one has two films in each. Even the artwork on the box has the cover of one film on the front and the cover of the sequel on the back. The last case has four films, the two Deathly Hallows parts and also bonus features. I have yet to open those up but I can't imagine what kind of goodies I have in store for me there.

Overall, great product and I would recommend this for any Potter fan!",1452902400,28,889,4.103448275862069
4563616,1,B00543R3WG,"I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter and when this Blu Ray set went on Cyber Monday sale it was too good to pass up. Movies 1-5 were perfect in sound and picture. The picture is crystal clear and vibrant and the sound is smooth and even; I never had to adjust the volume once. I could clearly hear the softer parts of the movie and the action scenes were not too loud. For some reason movies 6-8 were very much lacking in the sound department. In order to hear softer scenes I had to turn the volume up about 50% which resulted in the louder, action scenes practically blowing me out of my sofa! It's such a shame too. It seems like the title screens on movies 6-8 are also formatted differently, which I suspect is the reason why the sound is off. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be, but clearly the sound is not true Blu Ray quality on the last 3 movies. Even though the first 5 are perfect, the fact that 3 of the movies in the set are off ruins it completely. It makes the movies unenjoyable when you have to adjust the sound every 10 minutes.",1452902400,6,1042,4.112745098039215

It includes all the movies on blu ray and DVD plus the ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentary. Overall, very happy with this purchase.",1451433600,,589,4.453703703703703
4563740,4,B00543R3WG,"This complete 8 film set on Blu-Ray goes on sale occasionally on Amazon for about $40, making the cost of each film about $5. Technically speaking, there were 7 books and 7 films but the last book was made into 2 films. Each book/story shows another ""year at school"" for the child characters who themselves grow up throughout the series to become adult wizards.

The Blu-Rays look and sound excellent and is the way to own these films. For the value, I feel it is a 5-star collection. The Blu-Rays are also well-housed in a hard plastic book style case and there is also an outer cardboard cover which briefly explains the plot of each film.

You can spend more money buying the films individually in packages that include a lot more bonus materials, but I don't feel it's worth the extra money. This set also includes hours of bonus material, just not as much. Fans of the books may want it all though.

To be honest, I must admit that I've not read the books, so I cannot comment on how accurately the films adapt the books to the big screen. Also, I did not watch any of these movies until all the films were out on DVD to rent and then I rented and watched them all in order. It's best to watch these back to back, so you can see how details are dealt with from one film to the next. I bought this set recently and I'm re-watching the films in order and enjoying them again.

However, they are not all equally enjoyable. The first 2-3 are my favourites, as I like the on-screen chemistry between the trio of friends and there is more humour. As later films focus more on Potter, and a comical love interest sub-plot, I feel they are missing ""something"" and the pacing drags at times. It could also be that the producer's of the films change and the plot is becoming far more serious and less fun. That is why I deducted 1 star from my rating.

The films were all well done in terms of how they were filmed, special effects, etc. They are all big budget films and the shortest film is just over 2 hours. The films are well cast and it's great all the actors remained for all 8 films, which took about 12 years to make. That meant that some of the more established adult actors returned for very tiny roles in successive films, which rarely happens. It's a shame Richard Harris died in 2002 and had to be replaced as Dumbledorf, as I much preferred him in the role. It's also very neat to see the child actors grow up and yet maintain their characters so well/smoothly/evenly. TV actors can do this easily but it seldom works with film actors, who usually get years off between films. It helps that these films were done in close succession. It's also neat that none of the child actors grew up to be ""messed up"" fodder for the tabloids, and hopefully they will continue with successful acting careers. The child actors really did exceptional jobs, and it helps that they used a British cast and not a Hollywood one.

A warning to parents: I remember when these films and the books came out there were negative comments from the Catholic church about the wizardry being something of a popularization of Satanism, and I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. After all, many children's tales contains witches and wizards. However these films, especially from the 3rd film onward are definitely too dark for children. The way some of the evils spells are depicted can really be scary (werewolves, demonic possession, etc.) and are not suitable for pre-teens, especially without adult supervision. The film makers' intention was that the young viewing audience would themselves age and therefore be more suitably mature to handle the darkness of each successive film.",1451433600,,3674,4.550680786686838

I found it odd that the first disc went straight to the movie instead of to a menu screen. I like to put the movie in and then go do something while it goes through previews and whatnot (get some popcorn, make a cozy pillow/blanket fort) and then come back to the menu screen. I came back to this and it was 20 minutes in to the movie! I haven't seen the others from this collection yet, so I'm not sure if they'll do the same.

That's fine except I can't even play the movies - they constantly skip.

Would have totally returned this!  This is NOT the complete movie!!!  The DVDs are the TV version the one they need to cut to fit into the allotted TV time frame.

4563794,5,B00543R3WG,"I didn't discover until after the return window closed that the set I ordered does not offer Closed Captions, on the first 5 episodes. They're available on the last. I have a hearing problem that makes the voices of most women and children totally unintelligible, so any not-captioned DVDs are useless to me. Captioning on DVDs is currently voluntary, so unless Amazon includes correct information on captioning in the product description,  I can't tell until I buy one and try it. In this case, the set was bought in October as a Christmas present, so we didn't discover the problem until last night, well beyond the 30-day window for returns.

Update: Apparently Amazon merges all reviews for the Harry Potter set, even though there are 3 different offerings. I bought the set dated May 14, 2003 in the list, and Amazon's description says ""Subtitles: English"". But there are no subtitles/captions/options at all on the first disk. I would buy another set (the original is beyond the 30-day return window), but how would I know whether other descriptions are accurate either?

UPDATE: Amazon generously refunded my account for this set, and I ordered a replacement 5-disc set to replace the ""defective"" DVDs in the original set. HOWEVER, I found the set of 5 to be similarly ""not captioned"". At this point I decided that the DVDs were probably OK, and that either I or my equipment were the problem. I turns out to be mostly an inconsistency in the way the Languages (and captioning) option on these DVDs is presented to the user; the remainder of the blame falls on me, a user who, in my (weak) defense had never seen this inconsistency in many years of viewing DVDs.

""Normally"", as the DVD is loaded, a menu is presented listing all options, including Languages. In these ""defective"" DVDs, you must wait until the movie actually begins, then press ""Pop-Up Menu"" (on my DVD player controller; may be different on others) to call up the normal menu. Pressing it at the wrong time will do nothing, throw an error, or, on some, call up a different menu of special features. Having seen this sequence, it's actually much more convenient for those who don't normally mess with the Options menu. If the DVD player could be set to always turn on captioning, it would be even better.",1451001600,,2278,4.774111675126903

4563807,1,B00543R3WG,"I purchased the 8 film collection only to have multiple movies out of the set completely not work with both of my blu ray players (Xbox One and Samsung) The codes I received from my Xbox stated that the movies were not original titles, but, copies. Disc six didn't even match the artwork which was consistent throughout the remainder of the discs. Only disc 7 had a dvd menu to access the bonus features, which are clearly listed on the back of the box, the three movies that played did so as soon as the dvd tray closed.
I asked for a replacement to this set. When they arrived the case was the same, the disc artwork the same, however, the technical issues were with different disc numbers.
Although the shipping was expedient the product is sub par and are believed to be copies instead of originals.

I shant purchase any further iterations of this set from these muggles.",1450656000,2,876,4.509433962264151

4563836,4,B00543R3WG,"Congratulations! You made it this far in narrowing down your decisions as to which Harry Potter set to get. Seeing as there are what seem like a ton of options for Harry Potter box sets, I'll make this review short and sweet.

This set comes in one big box that holds one case that holds all eight Blu-Ray discs - I got the one that is pictured in the product description with the picture of Hogwarts on the front. It's a great set to have if you're looking for a Blu-Ray set of all eight films in one box that is compact and easy to bring on a trip, share with friends, or watch repeatedly.

I decided on giving this set four stars instead of five because it's not an ""organized"" set, and here's what I mean: each Blu-Ray disc is just a repackaged version of the ones sold individually - meaning that they don't match, and some discs have more features than others. The menu navigation is also different for each disc so it's confusing as you watch multiple films and the controls aren't the same.

Also worth pointing out - my Blu Ray player has issues playing some of these. So far, no issues in the films I've watched with skipping, but some discs take a lot longer to load than what is normal for my machine, and I thought that was odd.

All in all, a great set if you're looking for a barebones option. However, if you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan looking for something more substantial, this is not for you. I'd recommend this product. Blessings!",1450224000,2,1455,4.357933579335794

This set is really nice. It is one case, containing 1 disc for each film. There are some special features included on the discs, but the down side is that if purchased individually, you would get an extra disc with additional content.

Another thing to note, is that this set is not consistent across all discs. All discs have similar images on them with the exception of the Half Blood Prince, which is notably different looking, and starts with two annoying previews.

After buying the first few by themselves I realized we were doing it wrong...so I told my husband we weren't buying any more of them until they had a set....once the set came out I told him it was too expensive...then I saw the lightning deal and snatched it up...as if it were a cupcake...and I were a fat kid.

It looks beautiful on the shelf with the rest of my collection (which is rather large) and all the discs play well in our xbox one as well as in my computer. We are both quite pleased.

1/27/16 - I must add a note and remove a star. My initial excitement turned into a bit of a hastily written review. Upon further inspection and after watching them all a few times...I have found some things that are a bit annoying. One of the discs clearly says ""disc 1"" but no disc 2 is included for that movie...so it looks like they just dismantled previous editions of that movie and packaged disc 1 in...leaving out disc 2.
I also feel that when you buy a set like this of all of the movies...they should give you the option to skip the never ending previews for the same crap over and over again.

I repeat, this is NOT the DVD set that you're looking for. Personally, I just wanted to be able to watch all of the HP movies, and these work great. They're definitely copies of the original movies, so the quality is the same, but it's awesome to be able to watch any of the films on a whim.

It's a really great steal for the price, and I love the fact that all 8 films go in ONE case. You don't have to worry about fumbling around with multiple DVD cases and the outer cover looks great, too. All in all, it's not a bad purchase. 10/10",1449446400,,688,4.0588235294117645

4563911,5,B00543R3WG,"Update: I'm returning the first set and reordering. Hoping for better luck. HP Part 2 became unwatchable around minute 56 due to disc errors. I will update if the replacement set does not have the same problem. Not happy I had to pay the on-demand price to finish the movie we had waited three weeks to watch (while we finished reading the book).

*********************************************************************

Overall, this set delivers great value. I spent more buying the first four movies when they were released. I bought this set primarily to get the last four movies and secondarily to replace our existing DVDs with Blu-Ray. The picture quality of the old DVDs suffers greatly with a 4K TV; these look great. After reading the other reviews, I was not expecting bonus content for each movie, therefore I'm pleased to report the inclusion of deleted scenes and some ""making of"" features on each disc. I'm sure there are other sets with more content, extended director's cuts and so on, but this set includes at least what was on the original theatrical release discs. Another bonus, the movies start immediately upon starting the disc, you don't have to wait through a long intro animation to load the menu or page through menus (an annoying feature of the aforementioned DVDs). My only caution: my kids kept asking why ""they"" changed the name of the first movie to the Philosopher's Stone. I tried to explain about the original  name of the book and so on, but they found it ""weird"". I need to get a UK copy of the book and really freak them out. :)",1449446400,,1565,4.810408921933085
4563912,5,B00543R3WG,I bought the 8 blue ray set for $35 when it went on sale.  Having owned the DVD version of these movies I could observe a major difference in picture quality.  I can't even estimate how many times I watched the DVDs.  After watching  these blurays I can see the amazing details in the sets the crew made.  My eye keeps getting drawn to the beautiful scenery that never really stood out before.  I would highly recommend this set if you ready for an upgrade or purchasing for the first time.  My set came in perfect condition,1449446400,,524,4.34020618556701

This is going to, hopefully, be a short, sweet, and to the point review. The review is also of the product itself; not a review of all the movies and special features like so many people of put on here.

To clarify, this product is the ""Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection DVD+Blu-Ray"" Amazon option ""Multi-format"" version (I think it is selling for around $150 right now...I got it for $90 as a Black Friday, or was is Cyber Monday?, special!)

Along with this Box Set, you get the UltraViolet version of, supposedly, the entire box set! (I haven't downloaded my copy yet.) This offer is valid until March 4, 2016. So hurry up and buy this set!

Conclusion: With this box set, you get the Blu-Ray, DVD, and (until 3/4/16) digital copy of all 8 movies! As a bonus, you get the 3D Blu-Ray version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow Part 1 & 2, if you have a 3D Blu-Ray player, unlike me...but as I stated before I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan and would like to have those version if ever I do buy a 3D Blu-Ray player and appropriate equipment. This box set pretty much includes every single thing you could get on DVD about Harry Potter!

If you are NOT a hardcore ""Pott Head"" (get it!?), and just enjoy the movies, I would suggest just getting the 8 disc Blu-Ray or DVD set that only includes the movies and not all the nifty special features and bonus disc!",1449100800,"1,051",3636,4.6912

UPDATE 2/26/2017:
We only got through the first couple movies until now. We were on a Harry Potter binge with some friends and when we got to The Half Blood Prince the bluray player wouldn't play the film. We inspected the disc and saw it was scratched up and it had a different look than the rest of the blurays. Our copy of The Half Blood Prince says ""Disc 1 Movie"" and the bluray disc symbol is different. (Check out the photos I've attached.) This is the first time we've tried watching The Half Blood Prince. Does anyone know how we can contact the seller to get a replacement? I'm worried since I purchased this in November 2015 that it's too late, but this is the first time we've really tried watching all the films from this set. I should've looked more thoroughly through the discs when we got them. It was in plastic when we received it so I thought nothing of it. Any help is greatly appreciated. If this issue gets resolved I'll be changing my rating to 5 stars definitely!",1449100800,,1059,4.348484848484849

Scratches everywhere and the dvds themselves are messed up and have fingerprints on them, when I bought this NEW. There should be thing on them, let alone prints plus smudges all over them.

The packaging is beautiful, but I worry one day I will scratch a disk. If I had kids I would not let them handle this set. I would probably put the dvd copies in one of those zip up cases and let them use that instead. The set is packed with special features.

4564085,3,B00543R3WG,"So far the movies are great BUT I noticed on each disc it is marked ""FOR RENTAL OR RESALE""...I thought nothing of it until I ran the disc.  The movie pretty much starts right away and doesn't have the regular disc menu like SETUP, LANGUAGE, CHAPTERS, ETC.  I, being of ""hard of hearing"", I always use the subtitles option.  In this case, there is NO option for Subtitles!  Therefore, I have to turn up my hearing aides more to understand what is being said in the movie OR ""crank up the volume on the TV (not good with the neighbors, I live in an apartment)!  So because of the lack of ""SETUP"" or a movie menu before the movie starts, I have to rate this set just three stars...sorry!",1445299200,3,684,4.271317829457364

This is obvious in the fact that not all the disks have the same style, and that the sixth disk says ""DISK 1 MOVIE"", and the 7ht, and 8th saying ""THE MOVIE"", and while this is not a huge thing for me, I know some people prefer to have a matching set when they buy a complete collection. Overall I am happy I purchased this, and I am sure I will get hours upon hours of entertainment.

They accuse how WB constantly does this for the Harry Potter franchise, and to be fair, WB has been doing incomplete Potter boxed releases for years, starting with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" onwards. But when the WB actually makes a nice package with all eight films included, they still complain because there's hardly any bonus material. WB did this for their first four Batman movies before the glorious Batman Anthology came to be, so those fans have been waiting a long time that as well.

The set will just have a repressing of the initial releases, and the first three movies include their respective trailers, while ""Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2"" have deleted/extended scenes, so the ""no extras"" claim doesn't hold as much water.

4564263,5,B00543R3WG,"I'm actually very pleased with this product! It's very cheap, and very good quality. There are, however, a couple of things that I feel I should point out.

First, the case that it comes in is a standard mass production case that most multi-disc sets use. Don't expect a lavish collectable case, especially for the price. The case is still very durable, and allows all of the movies to be stored in a small amount of space.

Second, the films in this set ARE NOT THE SPECIAL EDITIONS. They are standard edition, as if the first disc from each movie was put in here. While there are some special features, there are not a lot.

Next, the discs themselves appear to be great quality. All of mine worked extremely well, and there were no defects whatsoever, save one thing. The disc that I received for Deathly Hallows Part 1 is missing a cover. The disc is all black, and the title and copyright information are on there, but there is not picture.

December 29th All the Harry Potters are going into the Warner vault (no vault is not a Disney coined term) That means for about 2-5+ years they will print no more new Harry Potter DVDs. For probably about a year or so the warehouses will continue to ship what they have to stores like, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and stores like Movie Trading Company. Gradually the dwindling of supplies will cause the bigger stores to stop ordering them and only stores like mine will carry them until the warehouse runs out and then we run out and for once the Harry Potter movies become rare. Prices will skyrocket because it's a popular series.

Now, 5+ years later they release an awesome SUPER special addition that will cost a billion dollars and have all the bells and whistles.

The whole series contain a lot of dark scenes, which will test your system's ability to handle dark schenes.  Audio is somewhat disappointing because the first 5 films have only ""lossy"" DVD-quality Dolby Digital format.  The last 3 have high def formats.

This Blu-Ray collection provides you with all 8 films conveniently located in 1 enclosure and is a MUST for any fan of Harry Potter that may not physically own the series yet. At the current price point of at the time of this review, each movie equates to approximately $8.00 which is an absolute steal for any fan of the series.

Full disclosure, this is a no frills film collection. If you are interested in purchasing a ""collectors"" type of Harry Potter on Blu-Ray, you may want to look elsewhere. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with the presentation and packaging of this collection, it is not as elaborate and full of extras like some of the other Harry Potter film collections out there (though those are typically more expensive).

However, if you are simply interested in adding the Harry Potter series to your Blu-Ray collection, this is a cost-effective way to do so.",1439856000,3,1077,4.779569892473118

4564312,3,B00543R3WG,"For clarification, this is for the 31-disc Hogwarts Collection (the book-style one, not the huge box).

While I'm very pleased with 90% of the quality of this collection, one part crucial to longevity has sadly been overlooked by the manufacturer.  The spine of the book containing the discs has no reinforcements and is very thin, and as a result is very flimsy.  It almost feels like after a just a few uses it might start tearing.  The book and the sleeve it sits in are both very beautiful, the discs are perfect quality, and the hours of extra behind-the-scenes footage are a great addition to this post-Mainstream-Harry-Potter-movie world.  If you enjoy watching extended versions of movies, this has the first two released (there's something with a distributor or something that is preventing extended versions of 3-8 being released) and/or enjoy watching everything that went in to making these fantabulous movies but don't want to pay $500+ for the Wizarding Collection (the giant box one), I'd highly recommend this set.

However, you do get what you pay for, and given the cheap per unit rate that I paid for (which is around $10 per movie), I am pleased with the purchase.

It is disappointing to learn that this is just a repackaging of the existing Blu-ray discs that are currently in other sets, as well as the lack of proper representation of the disc art as photographed by the product image in this listing. But these are just minor complaints.

Again, I was not looking for a LOST style box set, with feelies and loads of extras that are just as long as the movies themselves.

The title of this release is ""The 8 Film Collection""; it is not called ""Collector's Edition"" or ""Deluxe Edition"" or ""The Bonus Features Galore Collection"". This is a nice little set for casual fans who simply want all 8 films on blu-ray. And considering this set is (currently) less than $80, how can you complain?

Yes, if you're a huge fan of the franchise and want extended cuts and bonus features, save your time and money and wait for a possible future release. But I find it silly that so many reviewers are ""warning"" others not to buy this release because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles.

(All eight movies on blu-ray, the last two on 3D blu-ray, and the right DVDs as well as a dozen special features discs) A voucher for a digital copy of all eight films is also available, which is very cool to have.

If one doesn't care to have all the bonus content, one of the other HP box sets would suffice. However, if you're a big Potter fan, this is definitely worth your money. I've loved (finally) watching all of the bonus features that I missed out on through the years.

The feel of the set actually reminds me of the scrapbook Hagrid gave Harry at the end of the first movie, though I don't think that was intended. The material that the discs sit in is designed to be gentle on your discs when sliding them in and out of the case, which I had been concerned about pre-purchase.

4564360,2,B00543R3WG,"This should be pointed out before buying this, if you're like me you actually like to hear the dialog. The problem with this is if you turn your volume up enough to hear the dialog then when effects or music start it's so loud it literally causes glass to vibrate in our room. We sit about 12 feet from the tv, and we have a sound bar. I have exceptional hearing, wife on the other hand doesn't lol.

Other than that, the movies are decent but after the second movie none truly follow the books, so if you're expecting the book to come to life on the screen, it won't, so much is different. Granted we saw these at the theaters but wanted this set for our movie collection, unfortunately we will return it because of the sound issues.",1438214400,4,734,4.280575539568345

For some reason the main menus are almost impossible to access, I have to trick my bluray players to access them (I have tried on three devices).  It is so frustrating to navigate this collection that I often find it easier to use my old dvd versions instead.  To make matters worse the disks are of really poor quality.

I always leave my media in the proper case, never spraying or scratching the disks with anything.  I can honestly say that I have never had this problem before!",1436832000,,729,4.323529411764706

4564530,4,B00543R3WG,"Doesn't have extended editions - realized when abc fam did the Harry potter weekend a couple weeks ago that scenes were missing. They are included as bonus items as well as several other things like behind the scenes interviews and making of shorts. A lot of bonus content actually including interactive directors commentary edition.

The deleted scenes that are included in the extended edition (but not this edition) aren't that necessary- not worth another $30 or whatever the box set costs. The sounds does seem to be a bit wonky- super loud for music and battles and then you have to turn it back up for speech .",1434499200,2,617,4.712962962962963

Well, many of these scenes have a weird digital blurring of basic character motion, not even during special effects scenes just Harry walking across the screen and he looks all choppy and glitchy. I have no idea what's going on but it's pretty obvious many of my discs or movies in general have video problems. I have to check my receipts, maybe I bought it from Walmart and I can get a exchange to see if it's just the way all the movies are.",1434412800,,569,4.229357798165138

4564553,2,B00543R3WG,"This is just judging the blu-ray discs and the packaging itself not the movie.
So it was delivered with the middle piece hinge with a crack in it and some of the placeholders for the discs were broken (the pizza piece as I call it)
Then there were the movies themselves. They basically cannibalized blu-ray discs from all the unused blu-rays that didn't sell I guess.
For EX: theres a DISC 1 on one of the movies when there is no DISC 2
The audio on the first 5 discs is wonky.  It just doesnt sound right.
6-8 the audio is good but all of the sudden the video gets super dark so you have to turn up the brightness.
Tried this out on the PS3 and even switched back to an old dedicated blu-ray player to see if the problems still followed.
They did.
It is relatively cheap though but if I had to do it over again I would have spent some extra money on a version that didn't have these problems.",1433808000,2,893,4.132183908045977

The problem I have with product is that each move has parts of scenes ""CUT"".

The only difference in this version that I know of is the first movie is ""Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""Sorcerer's Stone"", which is what it should be anyway. The UK version is region free and will play in a US blu ray player. This set includes all 8 of the movies and 3 bonus discs for the last 3 movies. So far I haven't found any faults with this version. Sure it's lacking extras, but what can you expect for the price. I don't watch the bonus features anyway.",1432425600,2,575,4.142857142857143

4564778,5,B00543R3WG,"(You don't have to go to Amazon.uk to get the cheaper package anymore; it's right here. It's the one with three faces of Harry on the cover.)
There are a few 'complete set' versions of the HP series on Blu-ray. The movies themselves look great on all of them, so the difference goes only to packaging, extras and value. If you like loads of extras, get the set with the picture of Hogwarts and students crossing the lake in boats on the cover. Personally, I don't care beans about extras; I never watch them. For me, the set with pictures of Harry's face on the cover was a much better value. It is half the price (at the time of this review), it contains all 8 films (none on 3D), and it looks nice on the shelf. It doesn't have a ton of extras, but there are a few. The packaging is a slipcover that houses plastic cases for the movies themselves.
This set is the UK version of the movies, but they will play just fine on American Blu-ray players. Blu-ray doesn't have region coding like DVD does. The only difference between the UK and US versions is that with this set you get the UK poster movie covers (kind of cool, imo), and the 'Sorcerer's Stone' is called the 'Philosopher's Stone' (just like with the books). The movies themselves are exactly the same.",1426809600,,1263,4.378723404255319

I didn't need, nor did I want, any of the extra stuff.  All I wanted were the movies.  They arrived in good shape, and in a container that's more than adequate.

1st - the insert in the actual case feels like printed piece of paper, its not HQ photo glossy. this one looks real good, but feels off.
2nd - the actual sleeve, its got a great reflective shine to it, then i flip it over and its got long cut on the bar code. not a deal breaker just an eye sore.
3rd - the 1st film isn't the ""same"" as the others. the 6th film, awkwardly labeled as ""disc 1"" and like the 1st disc it doesn't match the rest.

to conclude this set just feels off, all the other trilogy's i own are all in uniform this one just feels like it was thrown together and missed certain details.",1424736000,6,709,4.0212765957446805

I have all the books also so a big fan and follower when it was being released slowly, one book at a time and one movie at a time with long waiting in between. I was disappointed in not seeing a difference in the Bluray editions. You would think it should make some difference? Toy story was awesome but it was animated so maybe that is why. Harry Potter seems darker and no eye catching affect. Oh well. I am new to replacing (only a dozen or so more dvds were purchased to replace old versions of mostly Disney movies, in Bluray versions. Because of animation being so colorful to begin with, I suppose that is why such a difference. I AM sight impaired so may not be best judge. Sure see difference in the animated films when in Bluray.",1424304000,,861,4.288343558282208

However, there are several issues. The first movie is titled ""The Philosopher's Stone"" rather than the title in the US ""The Sorcerer's Stone"". As near as I can tell, the movie is the same. The discs themselves say ""labeled for resale or rental""...I am not sure what that means. But when you put it in the BD player it just starts playing. No titles or other intros, and so far (still watching #1) no option for set-up, features, language etc. Apparently I should have known this was some kind of bargain box set. My daughter is kind of disappointed. I guess I somehow missed all the other buying options, but I don't think it was clear from the description  what this set was.",1424044800,,818,4.417218543046357

4565034,5,B00543R3WG,"I purchased a box set of complete Harry Potter films from Amazon.co.uk which included all 8 movies plus 3 additional feature discs for far less than this box set of only 8 discs.  U.K. total cost (purchase plus oversea delivery and import duties) was $34.87 which is much less than this cost of $62.49 for only the 8 movie discs.  Amazon U.S. does sell the 11 disc box set which is the same set sold by its U.K. partner for $43.31 which is still far more, and the Amazon U.S. prices are not the total cost (no tax or shipping if applicable is included in the U.S. prices).

This set box of 8 is described as being aspect ratio of 1.77:1 (which is another way of saying 16:9) which fits the HDTV screens.  The other box sets (both U.S. and U.K.) come (depending on which disc is playing) in two aspect ratios 16.9:1 (HDTV screens) and 1.85:1 (theater screen).

The set I purchased from Amazon.co.uk, was not encrypted, i.e., it is region free.  All of the discs played on my Sony 3D Blu-ray player.  All with excellent picture and sound quality -- no issues with playback.

These discs (both U.S. and U.K.) do not come with digital copies nor with UltraViolet, but I uploaded (disc-to-digital) the 8 movies onto my VUDU account (paid $2.00/disc and would have been $1.00/disc if I had uploaded 10 or more instead of just the 8 movies) without any issues.

Overall, I would purchase this set again and I would go for the best deal which right now is Amazon.co.uk.",1422835200,4,1461,4.483018867924528

4565044,5,B00543R3WG,"**Review is for the UK Region Free 11 Disc Item**
Definitely grainy low quality picture even for the newer ones. Super cheap packaging. You get what you pay for. Was rather fun seeing the UK version of the movies. A few title variations, and there were definitely scenes that were slightly different in dialogue and length. Had a couple issues with discs having a few bad spots such as issue with picture during a scene and sound pops going through the system. (only the last 2 or 3 discs had the issue with varying frequency). Bought this for a friend but I'm holding out for a super high quality blue Ray HD set for myself.

**Update**
I have since re-purchased from the same seller for my own collection during a Black friday deal to get the buyndle of all 8 for $35. The quality of these is Much better now and no issues with case or sound! I'm in the midst of binge watching them again and am completely satisfied with the quality of these!",1422835200,,945,4.4
4565045,5,B00543R3WG,"After looking at several reviews, it rather looks like Amazon is grouping reviews of several versions all together.  To be clear, then, this is for the version titled ""Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free].""

It's not indicated in the Amazon listing (In fact, the listing at the time of this review doesn't even include a description), but since the first movie in this is ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" it's clearly the UK versions.  That said, the movies play fine, look crisp and clear, and the discs include many extras -- I was especially pleased to see a lot of deleted scenes I'd not previously seen.

Fantastic bargain for the price -- $43.41 at the time of my purchase -- and I couldn't be happier.",1422835200,,758,4.8076923076923075

I hadn't seen them most of them since the theater, and it was amazing to see how well they played back-to-back. The whole story flows really well all the way through. Quality of the Blurays is great. I wish they had included the final film in 3D, but I just bought it separately to have it in my collection. The extra features are pretty good too on these. I haven't watched them all but the ones I did see gave a fun glimpse into film-making and I actually learned a few cool facts... like the actor who played the lead in Willow actually played all of the dwarf characters in Harry Potter. Really cool!

Definitely check this out if you haven't seen the films or if you're looking to add to your collection. These are definitely modern classics that can be enjoyed over and over again.",1422748800,2,857,4.424050632911392

I was extremely happy with the quality of the HD transfer to blu-ray, and the content in this box set though. Especially for the price. All the movies look amazing on disc. The first movie is the only one that really stands out as it has a bit more noticeable film grain to the image than the others. I actually enjoyed it though, as I thought it gave the image a bit more life. Overall, just a really high quality collection of blu-rays, but I wouldn't expect anything less.",1422230400,,621,4.271186440677966

4565220,1,B00543R3WG,"As you can see by comments about cases and by customer photos, many, MANY people are reviewing the incorrect product here. This product is a set with each film on both DVD AND BluRay, free digital downloads of each film, as well as extra DVDs with behind-the-scenes information and other bonuses. It comes in a sturdy, attractive flip book-style housing wherein each film receives a two-""page"" spread. The book slips into an attractive cardboard sleeve for tidy storage.

The set is very attractive. There is only one issue: The BluRays have been encoded in such a way that they ONLY work in laptops that play BluRay or in the gaming systems that play BluRay. The BluRay discs would play neither in my player, which is about 2 years old, nor in my uncle's player, which is only about 6 months old. They WOULD play on my laptop and using my cousin's BluRay-capable gaming system. Amazon replaced the first set and we found that the second set had the same issue.

With this problem, the set is not suitable for me, as I purchased these to watch on my television at home using a BluRay player. Had I wanted to be relegated to watching them on my laptop, I would have downloaded them. Until the encoding of the BluRays is corrected, I will not be repurchasing this product.",1420848000,12,1270,4.590308370044053

Be aware, however, that these discs (for the most part) contain only the films.  I hardly watch the Special Features sections of movies anyway so this was not a problem for me.  Also be aware that the discs are from the ""Individual collections.""  In other words this set, is a bundle of Bluray discs stripped from the individual editions that were released and then compiled into this set.  That's why The Half Blood Prince cd has ""Disc 1"" printed on it, even though it's the 6th movie.  Do not expect 8 newly pressed discs for this edition.",1420588800,,688,4.3700787401574805

4565277,3,B00543R3WG,"This was a birthday gift for my wife because she's a huge Potter fan. I was never interested in watching any of these movies, so I decided that I was gonna watch all of them with her & really try to enjoy myself as part of the gift experience. The cover art is beautiful. Very sturdy case & plenty of special features to keep you busy for days. The slip covers are similar to the Bond 50 collection, only easier to take out. I only wish it had a commemorative book to accompany the movies.
Getting the collection in Blu ray, DVD & digital copy is great. Plus, we get to add two more 3D movies to our collection since The Deathly hallows is also included in 3D format.
Now the reason I rated it three stars is because although I loved the packaging & the hours & hours of special features, I didn't really like the movies. I found myself bored at times. (Don't tell my wife though) They felt very long. Don't get me wrong, i'm a fan of 3+ hour long movies like Lawrence of Arabia, Cleopatra or Ben-Hur but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get into these movies so they seemed long to me. If I had bought this collection for myself & hadn't watched them with my wife, I probably would have rated this collection one star, but seeing how much joy it gave her to give me all the details of every character, made it worth watching. If you're a real fan then you probably already own these on Blu ray & I don't think spending $100 - $150 for special features alone is worth that price. My wife had them on DVD so I decided to upgrade her collection. It made her very happy. Making her smile was worth $99.",1420416000,,1610,4.180064308681672

When opening the DVD case, I was disappointed it was just a silver disc with the movie title, but that's quickly to get over. What I couldn't get over was the fact that there were fingerprint smudges  all over on each of the discs (my first thought that someone was eating a bag of chips and decided to pop in the DVDs) and with that, scratches on both sides! Upon further investigation, I realized that even the movie titles on the discs weren't even of the same size. And where each was dark and bold in the lettering, Prisoner of Azkban was light and faded looking as if a different font was used. Making me question the whole collection even more.

4565312,5,B00543R3WG,"If you want to buy all of Harry Potter's movies in a single package, and you don't care much for extra features, look no further. At less than $7.00 per Blu-ray, this set gives you great value for your money.

I wasn't a fan of the Harry Potter saga when the movies first came out. In fact, it was not until the 3rd movie, Prisoner of Azkaban, that I decided to give in to the hype, and watch the first movie. I was hooked, maybe not to a hardcore level that would compel me to buy all the books and collectors editions, but just enough to want to have all the movies in high definition.

This collection has all 8 movies for $54.99 (at the time of writing). When you realize that you get all the movies for just under $7.00 each, the decision becomes fairly easy. The box is very compact for such a (big) collection. It has roughly the thickness of two regular sized single disc DVD/Blu-ray boxes put together.

Do keep in mind that this collection includes the movie discs ONLY. You do not get any extra discs with any features, though the movie discs do have a few extra features here and there.

Another thing to note is that not all the movies have the same languages. For example, the first movies (first four if I remember correctly) have 10 to 15 different language audio tracks available, but the rest have only English, Spanish, French and Portuguese (again, IF I remember correctly).

It seems to me that these collections are some sort of clearance of individual film box sets. For the sake of making a point, suppose that each movie is first individually sold in box sets that include the movie disc, and an additional disc with special features. Now suppose that you take only the movie discs from all 8 individual box sets and put them all together in a single box set. This is what you are getting.

The reason I think this might be the case, is that the last 3 movie discs have extra labels printed on them, which read either Disc 1 Movie or The Movie. These labels are usually printed on discs that are part of a box set that includes other discs with additional features, as a guide to tell them apart. I am including a photo so you can see what I mean.

Do keep in mind that this does not at all affect the quality or experience of the movies. I just point it out because you might notice the lack of consistency in the printed labels of the discs.

To wrap things up:

PROS
- Great value for money, at less than $7.00 per movie at the time of writing.
- Consistent video and audio quality. Great image and great sound in all the movies.
- Several extra features included in all the discs.
- All 8 movies neatly stored in a compact case.

CONS
- There are no discs dedicated to extra features. Most people will probably not care about this, but if having a lot of extra features is important to you, then you might want to check out another collection.
- The disc case feels cheap, especially the disc holders. They feel as if they would break easily.
- Inconsistent language audio track selection. Not all movies contain the same amount of available language tracks.

NEUTRAL
- No extra artwork included.",1420156800,18,3125,4.389273356401384

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $47.41, and contains 8 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $5.92 per film! Compared to the value of the individual Blu-rays of the 8 films, which have a total price of $89.08 and an average price of $10 - you could save $41.67 buying this boxset!

I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are all actually in a single dvd case, which is really nice because it condenses the movies in a smaller space.  The movies all play perfectly and have some special features (Note: this is not a collectors edition, so it does not have super extended features, but is still nice all the same).",1419984000,,535,4.2772277227722775

As has been noted, it is a bit cheesy but the discs for each movie appear to be from other packagings of that movie (I.e. labeled 'disc 1' on a few of them, etc).

4565461,5,B00543R3WG,Definitely worth buying. I love the fact that it does not take up much space in my library. The picture and sound is amazing and the movies themselves are great.

4565474,1,B00543R3WG,"This is a complete and total mockery of Blu-ray. Not all of these discs are ACTUAL, LEGITIMATE, Blu-rays. The quality isn't there and they look as though they have been stolen from old cases of movies that possibly didn't sell? (One of them even had ""Disc One"" on it... There were no other discs for that particular movie). I bought this for my husband, believing it would be a quality product. I keep reading reviews that say, ""Buy this from Amazon UK"". I must ask, ""Why the hell does it matter?!?"" If you're buying Blu-ray or something brand new off of a site like Amazon, I don't care if it's going to the USA, China, or anywhere else, for that matter. It needs to be of sound quality, and anything less is a slap in the face to the consumer. Boo Amazon (US apparently. Because I guess you get a better Amazon in Europe than we do in the US)
What is the USA becoming when you can't even buy something from a trusted site, IN the USA?",1419552000,2,936,4.264044943820225

4565477,3,B00543R3WG,"I am actually kind of disappointed in this set.  It seems that many of the movies are missing scenes that are even seen when broadcast on regular TV!  I have watched them a multitude of times so it was very obvious that these have missing scenes which kind of boggles me a bit.  I guess for the price they are ok, and the quality is decent.  Just disappointed that they aren't what I have been seeing on TV, I thought I was missing stuff because of commercials, turns out I was seeing more with the commercials than what is on some of these DVDs. One example of missing scenes is in Order of the Phoenix.  When they are in the forest and Umbridge is going on and on about how she hates children (as broadcast on TV) is completely missing from the disc, it just says ""She hates children"" and then on it goes without the rest of the speech!  I have noticed this on several discs....",1419552000,,880,4.2395209580838324

For me, $46.72 was a great deal for a perfect gift ($46.72 = price + tax & shipping = $5.84 per movie).  Others noted that these were bare bones videos, no extras, etc., which was just fine for us.  We never watch the extras included with movies, and we don't care about special packaging.  The videos come in one nice plastic type case, and all 8 movies are in the case.  I like the packaging and prefer something that is not going to take up a bunch of space on my shelves.  I have attached a picture.",1419552000,,650,4.278688524590164

The Blu-ray versions of these films are outstanding.  We have all the DVDs and have watched them many times.  The Blu-ray transition really adds more detail and in a manner that makes the films even more enjoyable.
For example, you can now easily make out the dirt and grime on the faces of Hermione, Ron and Harry during the final two films.  The Gryffindor common room's tapestries and walls have even more observable detail.  Obviously there are many other examples including the ceiling changes in the Great Hall and the paintings on the walls.  The 'black colors' (which are more prominent in the latter films) come across very well in the Blu-ray versions...with detail and richness that I had not noted in the DVDs.
I was also impressed with the sound quality of the films, though the visual differences are by far the reason to upgrade to Blu-ray if you have not already done so.
So, if you are wondering if the purchase of the Blu-ray versions of these movies is worth the upgrade, (Jurassic Park was NOT in terms of visual improvement, but was nice for audio) in the case of Harry Potter, it really is.",1419379200,4,1282,4.650442477876106

I'm not a big fan of how you have to get the discs out, which is the only reason I am taking off a star. You have to sort of push the disk from behind, and it just feels too rough. Maybe that's just me.

This is great for any Harry Potter fan. I would never spend the money on that larger collection...this comes with everything you need and more.

One note, my Blu-ray of the first movie is unwatchable. It has a large scratch that skips about 2 or three chapters. I tried cleaning it to no avail.

The size of the case is very convenient being only the width of about two standard DVD cases.
The disks are simple (just the labeling, no graphics) but that doesn't take away from functionality obviously.
The case isn't extremely durable. As long as you handle it the way one should then there will be no problems with a broken case.

I did not return for a number of reasons. (1 I worked in retail, so I do NOT like returns, 2 Because I was working and didn't watch right away I may have missed the return date anyways, 3 I find the trouble of trading out the disc for a $5 dvd at Target a cheaper solution). I always enjoy watching Harry Potter, therefore the 4 star review. Only recently I've came upon the special features which appeared following the film. I am pleased with the amount of features presented, and have learned a few things and find the material and subjects interesting.",1417737600,,709,4.378787878787879
4565614,5,B00543R3WG,Great addition to my movie library. Thank You,1417737600,,45,4.75
4565615,5,B00543R3WG,"I bought this during Black Friday on a whim, even though the reviews were REALLY confusing. It appears Amazon has combined the Harry Potter Hogwarts collection review with the less expensive package (typically priced at about $50). I've seen both in person now, and there are substantial differences between the two in both packaging and content.

Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection:
This packaging is NOT cheap. It's a thick cardboard-like book (reminds me of my Game of Thrones packaging, but still even better than that) which slides out of an equally sturdy cardboard case. The book contains pages where the DVDs are slipped into (not quite as protective as the plastic prong thingies, but that's really the only complaint I have). This collection comes with the extended cuts (for those that had extended cuts) and the mother-load of special features. The enormous trunk that was released last year for around $350 (now priced around $650) is probably the closest equivalent as you aren't only getting the standard edition movies. If you're like me and have been to Universal Studios Orlando Wizarding World more than twice and made the trek (assuming you're American) across the pond to London for the WB Studio Tour, but can't quite stomach $300+ for DVDs, no matter how wonderful, then this is probably the set for you. For me, the biggest selling point was that it came with the digital versions of the movies. The fancy packaging was an added bonus.

Harry Potter: 8-Film Collection:
This is available in either blu-ray or dvd and definitely the most economical way to get all 8 movies in one package. As some other reviews have noted, it's pretty standard packaging for dvd/blu-ray sets. This set is truly all about economy of price AND space. If you like the movies, but aren't quite the enthusiastic HP fan, then I'd say you should be perfectly happy with this one. I don't believe there are any (or if there are, there are not MANY) special features with these. It's just the films - straight up as you saw them in theaters.",1417737600,4,2036,4.847701149425287

4565617,4,B00543R3WG,"The DVD arrived ahead of schedule; the films were all brilliant, excellent quality.  The only minus is that the plastic housing which holds the DVD's in place was broken in parts, which might have happened in transit.  Otherwise, A+ to the seller.",1417737600,,247,4.857142857142857

4565627,5,B00543R3WG,"I am very thankful for this series. As a muggle I enjoyed the plot line and getting to experience a completely different world from the safety of my home. However it wasn't until I had children that I really began to appreciate the information this series provides. It has been clear, even from a young age, my children will be receiving letters from Hogwarts.
Hearing: I have had concerns about my childrens hearing. In the past when I tell them to clean their room or finish their food it seems they are hard of hearing. Ive had my childrens hearing checked out due to this concern but was assured they are fine. However, there are times when it seems their hearing clearly has magical abilities. There seems to be magical trigger words that my children can hear when spoken as a whisper in a different room. These include: chocolate, Frozen, Santa,kitty, park, and bath.
Levitation: This seems to be something that can only occur when a muggle isn't looking (aka me). The have the ability to get onto unstable and high reaching objects by these wizards kids is amazing!
Blowing things up: Again, no muggles can see this happening, but this may be the most common and difficult part of having magical children. Every time I give them food (especially the younger they are) they try to blow it up (or perhaps it is a different spell going wrong) and it ends up all over their faces, the walls, ceiling, and floor.
Communication: When frustrated with my muggle based linguistic skills, my children often resort to a communication style reminiscent of the Merpeople. I am unsure if this indicates that my children are part Merpeople (that may explain flooding the bathroom) or if they happen to have (somehow) become bilingual.
Im thankful to know a big more about the world of magical so that I can help guide my children once they receive their letters. If you feel your children are magical, or just want to enjoy an excellent series, I highly recommend Harry Potter.",1417651200,,1969,4.7101449275362315

4565635,5,B00543R3WG,"Nice set , This will be a gift.",1417478400,,31,3.0
4565636,5,B00543R3WG,"This is exactly what I needed. My girlfriend had never seen any of these movies before (crazy, right?), so I wanted the cheapest, most basic set I could find for us to marathon through. It comes in a mega sized single case that contains all 8 discs, which I actually love because I hate sets that come with several ""skinny"" cases. All of these are mostly just reprints of previous issues (you can tell since some of the films have a ""Disc One"" labeled on them), but they're pretty nice. Popping the disc in brings you straight to the movie... no fiddling for the remote to start the movie, no annoying trailers for 5+ year old movies to sit through, and no obnoxious menus with 10 second audio loops. Just the movie followed by a silent menu afterwards... it's perfect.

The actual quality of these blu ray transfers are just above average. Excellent at times, mediocre/poor in a few others. You can see some artifacts here and there, and the dark scenes can seem a bit grainy at times, but overall it's pretty good for the most part.

One other thing - as others have pointed out, the discs DO come with special features. Not many, mostly just deleted/alternate scenes, but plenty enough for casual fans of the series. I recommend the more hardcore fans go with the more expensive set, or even the UK version.

Overall - highly recommended if you're looking to get a somewhat cheap Harry Potter experience. I picked this up for $55 on Amazon, so that makes each movie a little less than $7 a pop. Considering how great the movies consistently are, that's a steal. If you don't mind the set skimping out on some featurettes and making-ofs and other extra features the individual deluxe copies had, this set is a no-brainer for Harry Potter fans.",1417478400,3,1745,4.586538461538462

There is usually between an $8-$15 difference in price between the 2. These are INDEED different, regardless of how similar they are described. Here's why

I'll start with the blu-ray that has 3 differently aged Harry's on the cover. You'll notice that it is bigger than the other collection being sold. What they don't tell you is that the discs are in 4 separate cases, 2 movies in each case. There are also 11 discs, not just 8. But to be clear on this, the 3 extra discs are just bonus content from the last 3 movies. All of the other movies have the bonus features on the same disc. There is a ton of extra content on each disc. You'll also notice, from a side view picture, the list of movies that are in the box. The first says, ""The Philosopher's Stone"", rather than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"". Don't worry, it's not a bootleg copy. It's the English (UK) version of the set. The U.S. version changed the name for marketing purposes and it doesn't affect anything about the set.

Now for the OTHER set being sold:

This set, with the cover being of the castle, is smaller and more compact. This is because it has an insert that unfolds with all movies attached to each fold. It's neater, takes up less space, and in my opinion, looks more like the set it should be. However, this set contains only 8 discs (1 for each movie), with NO Bonus Content discs. I know about this set because It is the same that I borrowed from a friend.
So, there's not much of a difference here. I bought the bigger looking box because of the extra content and it was cheaper. The other box looks more like a classic collection but lacks content. Still, any Harry Potter Collection is worth buying. You'll always have an urge to watch it again and again (I watch the series twice a year). The Blu-Ray makes a huge difference in quality over DVD, so if you have a good TV and a Blu-Ray player, you have to go Blu-Ray.

Hope this helped!

***UPDATE April 2017***

There's been a little more confusion because Amazon has added a couple other collections and newer Blu-rays of single movie of Harry Potter. It has been more difficult to search for collections so i've made it easier for you. Here are the links for the above mentioned collections that I reviewed:

""3 Faces of Harry"" collection (currently $65 on Amazon) -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQNOCZ0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

""Hogwarts Castle Cover"" collection (currently $60 on Amazon) -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OCFHHK/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk

Amazon has changed their Harry Potter supply lately. I'm not sure why, but Amazon has combined ALL reviews for different H.P. collections into one, leaving it difficult to distinguish between them all. Now it's hard to tell what any review is for. If my links are not highlighted, just copy and paste them.
***If you Search ""Harry Potter Blu Ray Collection"", it WILL NOT show you the ""3 Faces"" collection so please use the link that i've provided above***

***I would also like to make an important note of feedback from readers. There are versions that you need to be aware of that are MAY NOT be playable in the U.S. It's another collection that is European made and most of the time, the discs are not playable on North American Blu-Ray Players. Obviously if you're reading this and you live in Europe, it'll work for you. I've started to notice those little numbers on the cover that have an Octogon with a number in the center. It means Irish Film Classification Office. They're definitely European made discs. Buy at your own risk though. One reader wrote that they played on his Playstation but couldn't comment on a Blu-Ray Player.***

This should still help everyone. I will continue to update as needed in order to help you.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has created another buzz in the world of Harry Potter. If you haven't seen the movie, it is ""Fantastic""! AND IT'S COMING OUT ON BLU-RAY SOON!!!!!!!!!

RIP Alan Rickman, aka Severus Snape! You are  missed by all Fans.

4566090,5,B00543R3WG,"The region-free 11-disc edition (with three faces of Daniel Radcliffe on the cover) will probably be the best edition for most Harry Potter fans.  Unlike the stripped-down American version, there are Special Features for each film which go beyond just the deleted scenes.  The last three films have two discs each.
One departures from American blu-rays is that the discs go immediately to the film itself.  Those who are tired of wading through endless trailers will appreciate this.  If you want the Special Features, you just need to press the menu button.  They don't seem to have subtitles, and if you want to go to an individual scene, you need to click forward on your remote.  If this presents a problem, you may want to buy the American edition.  But I felt that the additional features were worth the sacrifice.

The costumes and makeup make you forget that you are peering into a fictional world, and the screen writers delivered the same emotions that I felt while reading the books.

4566190,5,B00543R3WG,This is a very nice set. 20 dollars less than the US edition (At the time I am writing this) and includes three more discs. One thing is that the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Blu-ray contains a region 2 symbol which may confuse some people but nonetheless is region free.

I bought these several months ago and just got to watching them and EVERY disc is riddled with playback problems. From small skips, to stopping to outright not working the quality of the discs are terrible. The movies of course are great even if this compilation doesn't include many extras but check to see if your discs are working. This has actually happened to me a few times with Amazon purchases now so I'd strongly suggest reviewing these discs right away so you can replace them if they are bad.",1403568000,,665,4.55

4566210,4,B00543R3WG,"First off great collection.  All the bonus features are great.  Do you have a 3D player?  If not consider getting a 3D converter box and 3D Blu-Ray player.  Both for about $100.  I haven't done this yet but will after month beginning and update then.  Reason movies 7 & 8 have a 3D version on top of DVD and Blu-Ray.  I purchased this when it was an Amazon special and got a great price for it so I won't compare US vs UK and only talk about this package

Okay, now that you heard that lets get in more details.  As stated there are 31 disks a regular blu-ray, regular DVD, Ultraviolet and as well as a special 3D of each movie 7 & 8.  The bonus features most I had seen but a lot I hadn't.  Little tidbits like how they choose Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Did you know there is a godchild/godfather relation between Harris and the producer?  I don't recall seeing that in any other behind the scenes to which there are hours and hours of material.

I loved that the first two movies you got to see the theater release or the extended/ABC Family version.  I always prefer extended or director cuts even if they slow the movie for a moment or two.  I would have liked to have seen the deleted scenes restored and an extended version of all the rest of the movies made available in this set.  This is my first of only two digs I have with this set.  The second is the packaging.  Although they make it appear like a travel photo album the packaging is cardboard sleeves holding three or four disks per movie per page.  The graphics are nice but I prefer a more traditional pop release feature for my DVDs.

Unless they come out with extended versions of all 8 movies I suggest getting this for any Potter fan.",1402876800,3,1708,4.261682242990654

The left corner of the slip cover had a tear and the Blu-ray set in the left corner had a small tear in the binding. All of that doesn't really bother me, but for a product this popular and expense I would have expected a bit more care in how the manufacturer designs and packages them.

When I received it in the mail, the plastic of the case holding together the CDs in place were broken, causing the DVDs to move around. I wasn't too worried about that just the quality of the movies. I can't complain with the movies- each works completely fine, I am very content with that aspect of this product... BUT instead of receiving the Death Hallows part 1, I received two Half Blood Prince disks.

4566269,3,B00543R3WG,I just received the Blu-ray box set of Harry Potter films and I just have one comment. The Half-Blood Prince is split into two parts. This is very odd to me because it is not split in any other formats. Why is this?,1398816000,,215,4.023255813953488
4566270,5,B00543R3WG,"This is the most complete set there is. Everything released plus for Harry Potter dvds.

A lot of people that talk about no extras are talking of the simpler 8 disc set that sells for $50 for blu ray. $50 for 8 blu ray movies. What do you expect? Thats what I payed for the 4 indiana jones on blu ray and they are a lot older. Stop complaing about a set that you spent almost no money on but then call yourself a collecter. Shell out some cash.

And for the ones complaing that the 31 disc is buffed with regular discs and the 3Ds when was the last time you bought a movie. Thats how all blu rays and 3Ds are packaged now a days. Not only that but it says right on it blu ray + Dvd. That means both.

As for the 31 disc set its awesome. The price is right. Contains the first two extendeds, which WB says will be the only ones released so stop whining about the rest not being extended, awesome bonus materials. I like the box set having the 3ds for when I upgrade. The box isn't anything fancy but its solid. Reminds me of my stargate box set that I payed a lot more for and thats lasted me 6 years now. Ill be proud to display it next to my LoTR blu ray set, and my SG1. The intorior book containing the discs themselves is of the same material. Typical space and money saving design. Its highly decorated which is neat.

As far as people wondering about the extended versions and directors cuts, itll never happen. WB said no, the wouldnt have released the Wizards Collection, one of the most expensive and expansive box sets ever, until the very last final releases. Unfortunatly that means probably no 3d until maybe an anniversary. They didn't do it for LoTR and that made on average 10mil more a movie than HP.

Overall Im happy with this purchase.",1398816000,9,1755,4.211309523809524
4566271,5,B00543R3WG,"Yes, it is true you can also buy a boxed set that includes Blu-Ray and DVD. However, I elected to purchase the DVD Boxed Set because it was an excellent price for all 8 films from the Franchise!

This set contains all 8 films and they all upscale very well in a standard Blu-Ray player. If you are a person who doesn't care about the extra hours upon hours of bonus material that comes on the Blu-Ray set, then this is the set for you. You'll save money and be able to watch all the films as you did when you were in the theater.",1398729600,,529,4.038095238095238

I must admit that I was a little hesitant to buy this edition, thanks to the reviews, but for the price is the best option that you can ever have. Some people complain about the missing extended editions, but let's face it none of the movies from the 3rd one to the last one, ever had an extended edition included. Unless, that you work for Wanner Bros there is no way that you can have access to those editions. The only reason why i give this 4 stars is the Ultraviolet digital copy, I wish it was ITunes but that is just a personal opinion since i use more Itunes than any other digital copy service. In conclusion if you are not a hardcore fan that is waiting for some edition released in a package made from Phoenix feathers and rock incrustations from Hogwarts' facade.

The only extended editions in this set are the first two...why? That and that alone is the reason for my low grade. The special features look great and for those people who are cool with just getting the theatrical versions, this will be fantastic.

So understand, if you want the whole she-bang of extras, THIS SET IS NOT FOR YOU!

If you don't know what Harry Potter is, it's a story about an orphaned boy who discovers a secret world of witches and wizards after learning he is a boy wizard who is famous in the wizarding world.  Each movie holds a new adventure or him and his two best friends, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger.  This series of movies is based off of a series of books by the same names.

4566303,4,B00543R3WG,"A lot of negative reviews, I assume due to problems that have been rectified. First, I checked Disc 3 to make sure it was the correct Potter movie and not Polar express, as some customers received. Correct. Than watched the first installment in its entirety. I ordered the Blu-Ray version. It was sharp, with good color, and the sound was magnificent (particularly John Williams' score).

I'm not doubting that some reviewers had problems, but I believe they've been fixed. My discs had full color, illustrated labels. Some people complained of graininess, bad sound, and flutter/inability to play. They said they received a black label with only the name of the movie.

I'm a Florida resident and have a season  pass to Universal Studios thee park (and Disney).....I just wanted to familiarize myself so that the Harry Potter attractions made sense. At any rate, I enjoyed the first flick and look forward to seeing them all.",1396915200,,926,4.961290322580645

4566306,5,B00543R3WG,"I am very happy with this Harry Potter set. I didn't own any of the movies nor had I yet installed a Blu-ray player, so it was perfect to get. I wanted something with all the movies, tons of special features, and packaging that I can put on my movie shelf. The packaging itself is great and contains beautiful artwork. The book that contains the discs does look like it will wear and tear with age and use, but I don't really mind this. I also don't mind that movies 3-8 don't have extended editions. I have tried a majority of the discs on my new Blu-ray player, and they have all worked. I haven't tried the Ultraviolet service yet though since I don't really care too much for it. One thing that I did notice when looking at the discs is that a few of them had small scratches right when I took them out. This hasn't affected their use, however.

At first I wanted to purchase the Wizard's Collection, but the price was too much. I also missed out on the $150 Costco deal for it last winter. However, even if I did buy it, I wouldn't know where to put it since the box is huge. I bought this set for around $170, which I think is a good deal. The Hogwarts Collection in my opinion is a great, cheaper alternative to the Wizard's Collection if you can live without all the supplemental memorabilia. It's more practical too since it's not too big or bulky, and it can be placed on a shelf alongside one's other movies. This one fits right in with my Blu-ray collection.",1396828800,2,1470,4.268817204301075

4566314,4,B00543R3WG,"Let's say the most important thing first: this set of the Harry Potter movies is outstanding. Picture and sound quality are great with my recently purchased Samsung Home Theater. The price is very convenient, specially considering that there are 11 blu-ray discs in total. So it is really a great deal.

Now, the reason why I gave the product four stars and not five: the description states that all movies include subtitles in many idioms, including Spanish (I am from Uruguay, South America). The thing is, that only movies 7 part 1 and 7 part 2 come with these, while all the others include only English subtitles. This is not a huge problem for me because I know English and watching movies is always an opportunity to improve my skills, but it might be one considering that some of my family members do not know English.

The last two movies are in a case with two disks of bonus content, for a total of ten disks in all.  If you are looking for a really nice ""no frills"" version of each of the movies with few extra features (for a reasonable price) then this is the set that you want.

4566364,5,B00543R3WG,"I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, but when I was growing up they were huge and I can't remember why I never got into them. I suspect I will have to go read them now as the stories told in these eight movies are spectacular. One of the coolest things was to watch each of the kids grow into adults (and I myself am only a few years older than the three main actors). I'll not review the storylines of each movie here because others have done a better job than I could, for certain. However, the flow of each movie was really well done so that the pacing wasn't too fast. I don't know if this was true for those who had read the books, but as a first time introduction to the series it was very satisfying. The special effects were superb as well, but it was the story that Ms. Rowling weaves on book and then each director does to film. A great two weeks worth of watching.

On a side note, there are special features on the discs, but they are ""hidden"" on some. There is no menu for the first several movies (the show just immediately starts after previews) so to find them you'd have to press the ""menu"" or ""main"" button. I'm not really sure what button you'd have to press on a DVD or Blu-Ray player because I use my :PS3 for movies and I just press ""square"" to pull up the menu that way.

4566365,3,B00543R3WG,"The movies were right, but the discs came from different collections. 2 of 8 discs were obviously replaced. Overall, the collection is fine, but I think they should have mentioned it. I gave this as a present.",1394841600,,209,4.675675675675675
4566366,5,B00543R3WG,"I read a lot of negative reviews on this but ignored those opinions and went ahead and made the purchase.

My background:
I have been a potter head for half my life and have quite a collection of potter garb. I couldn't afford the Wizard collection and when I saw this, I thought it to be a steal. If you are like me, after many Potter thons your dvds are scratched and worn down. This seemed perfect to not only replace my old dvds but give me blue ray and digital copies as well.

Quick Math:
Blue ray collection ~ $65
Dvd Collection ~ $40

So for these collections which include no special features when bought in bulk nor do they come with the virtual copy. If this is what you want then you shouldnt even be considering the Hogwarts collection.

If you want all this with all the features and didgital versions, you are looking at `$25 per movie. This would bring you to a little over $200.

With this you would also not get all the special features worth your while like ""Creating the world of Harry Potter"" and the bonus disc which is incredible.

So in my opinion, this actually gives you more bang for your buck.

Now ignoring money but focusing on the content. I have watched all the special features from start to finish and I think that these features are probably my favorite piece of my potter collection. If you have grown up with these kids like I have it is an emotional documentary of the series and what the actors and actresses have gone through.

For all the negative reviews complaining about this collection, I would have to disagree with them because i believe there is a lot of gold material in this that you won't experience anywhere else.",1394668800,2,1665,4.4183006535947715

Just to be clear for everyone. Harry's # 1 & 2 have the Extended Editions & were always meant to have extended editions.

4566385,5,B00543R3WG,"I really love this collection.  Does it come with EVERYTHING that a hardcore Potter fan wants?  No.  It's still missing extended editions of movies 3-8.  There are lines that I've seen in trailers and BTS footage that are nowhere to be found in the deleted scenes.  There's probably still unseen BTS stuff that Warner Bros. hasn't released.

However, this is a really awesome collection.  Prior to purchasing this, I had just bought each DVD individually when they were released, so all the bonus features in this are incredible to me.  Some of them are the same things that were on my versions of the DVDs, but there's a ton of new stuff as well.  Like many Potter fans, I'm sure, I was considering buying the Wizard's Collection, but it was just so expensive that I held back.  This, from my research on the collections, is the same thing as the Wizard's Collection without all the collectibles.  For $150 less (give or take depending on Amazon price fluctuation), this is just what I was looking for.

The ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" segments are amazing and very long.  There are bits and pieces of interviews that overlap in various special feature segments, but for the most part, it's all different footage and interviews.  The book that Hagrid gives Harry with pictures of his parents is exactly what the book this comes in reminds me of.  The DVDs have their own sleeves within the book and I think they're well placed to not be damaged.  The only semi-bad thing I've found is that the number of DVDs might mislead you into thinking there's more special features in this than there actually is.  There's actually only one or two DVDs per movie with special features.  Two of the DVDs for each film are dedicated almost exclusively to the movie itself (Blu-Ray and regular version each get their own disc).  That said, there's still a ton of special features in this collection and, in my opinion, is worth the buy.",1394150400,12,1932,4.679525222551929

Also be aware that the third disc comes with a preview for The Polar Express that could make you think that you received an incorrectly programmed dvd, but going to the main disc menu will clear up any confusion.",1393891200,,488,4.191489361702128

(INCLUDING scenes that were filmed that haven't been released). All you're doing is releasing, rehashing, and reboxing the SAME thing. I don't understand why New Line Cinema can deliver beautiful extended editions of the Lord of the Rings franchise but Warner Bros. can't do the same thing for the Potter franchise. Yes, it would take a little bit of time and yes, maybe it will cost money but I would most definitely buy a complete set if it was worth it.  This set--like the older Wizard's Collection--is not. There is a wealth of things that we have never seen that would be worth inserting into the films. I've read many of the other reviews on this set and the older one and it seems to be that's ALL many of us are really wanting.

I'm trying so hard not to bash Warner Bros. I mean this is the company that brought the Potter books to live action in a beautiful way. However, the fact is I love both Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and New Line Cinema (which is a WARNER company) got it right. Warner Bros. still has not.

I'm just hear letting everyone know that its stupid to rate something that doesn't exist yet and the people
at Amazon, who are in charge of this, you shouldn't allow this feature to be on until the product exists.

(UPDATE: The product has been released and you may disregard the above statement, at least when concerning this product.

The discs are in four separate  Blu-Ray cases. The first 3 cases hold the first 6 movies and each are slightly larger  than a normal Blu-Ray case. The last 2 movies are in the final case and the case is the size of two normal Blu-Ray cases. All cases are in an outer cardboard box.

I have only seen the first two movies so far. The first 5 movies have 1 disc, while the remaining 3 movies have 2 discs each. While the last 3 movies have an extra disc for more features, the first 5 movies aren't completely extra-less. The first 5 movies do have Deleted Scenes on the discs of the movies as well as a few extras (some interviews, trailers and what not). Don't expect a special features packed box set but it does have some extra features.

My set arrived in perfect condition.....the outer box is perfect and the cases inside are not broken and the discs arrived secured and not loose.

The Video quality of the first two movies is excellent and what I expect from a Blu-Ray. I don't have a 5.1 sound system and I only watch the movies with headphones so not sure about audio quality other than it sounds great in my headphones. I am sure the sound is great in 5.1 systems.

But I would love if these movies did have a commentary on them, I thought that I heard they did have some that they recorded, but I might be wrong. But this box set it beautiful and I can't wait to watch all of the extras on these Blu-rays.  But for some people who haven't seen these movies, don't pay any attention to the one stars.

I am not necessarily looking for the extended versions (that would be asking too much, Warner Brothers?), but I at least want to make sure that I will be getting deleted scenes for every film in this set.  I apologize if I missed something in the item description that already answers my question, but I found it to be a little vague regarding deleted scenes.

I also only gave this two stars because, quite frankly, I don't like the idea of paying for DVD, Blu-Ray AND UltraViolet formats of one film.  That is excessive and a waste of at least two formats that I will never watch, which is ultimately a waste of money.  I'm just attempting to get a hold of the bonus features listed and deleted scenes (which I did not see listed) in a quick shot.  If I have to purchase DVDs separately in order to get this stuff, I will, but I wanted to see if this version was the way to go in order to get everything that I want (and unfortunately then some).  I have to say that Warner Brothers is not making this endeavor easy with all of the different packaging and releases of a single film.

Anyway, I appreciate any help with regard to my question about whether or not this set includes deleted scenes for each film.  Thanks a lot!  :)",1392681600,3,1575,4.3561643835616435

I even bought the Harry Potter hardback books as they came out for my grandson and I to read together.  What the next thing for us to buy?

I'm going to have to watch that special mini-film; it must be a miracle of film-making!

The reason I came to comment is that what we received was the UK version of the films/ box set.  My initial worry was that they wouldn't be coded correctly, but that didn't turn out to be an issue.

The only real issue I could see is that if a purist was looking for a US version, they might be disappointed.  The first movie in the UK is called ""HP and the Philosophers Stone"".  I am not sure if the actual movies are any different though.

There are extras included with these discs, as well.

4566574,4,B00543R3WG,"I love this story - many people do.  The Blu-ray collection looks to be compiled from previously released 2-disc sets of each individual chapter.  I wish there was a 9th disc that had the details on the 2nd discs of the individual chapters.

The video quality is utterly amazing.  This is one of the best HD renderings I've seen to date.  Excellent color saturation and luminosity.  The quality is so good that it overtakes the most annoying downfall of some of the chapters... the sound mixing.

Sound mixing is a post-production effort that, among many other things, applies volume to desired levels for each of the elements of a film including special effects and dialogue.  It is painfully obvious that the mixing engineer liked the special effects more than the dialogue - especially in the 5th and 6th chapters.  I had to turn off surround sound in the 6th chapter and verify my audio settings because of the inept mixing.  The dialogue audio is extremely quiet when separated out into its own channel on surround on these chapters (it is quiet in other chapters as well, but these 2 are the worst).  To hear the dialogue I had to turn up the volume significantly.  But then when the special effects kick in, the volume is disproportionately harsh.  I get it - explosions are louder than human voices.  But in film - moreso for family films than Rambo-like films - it is traditional to tone down the explosions and tune up the dialogue to balance the audio.  Not here though.  Just beware that this is the case and hold the remote at the ready!

Aside from that annoyance, the collection is wonderful.  A must-buy for all HP fans!",1391040000,,1636,4.641114982578397

Prior to purchasing this edition of the boxed set, I read several reviews for the American edition, stating that the UK edition was cheaper (at least at the time of my purchase) and included bonus content not included in the American version. Overall, a great purchase for a great price!",1390867200,,368,4.676923076923077
4566580,5,B00543R3WG,Have loved all the movies and wanted to own them in a set not individually.  Was perfect gift from my husband because he knows I never would have spent the money myself and he got on a great sale price around Christmas.,1390867200,,219,4.214285714285714
4566581,5,B00543R3WG,"This is an awesome deal! We had 4 of the movies previously on DVD and this 8 disc collection is very compact and is thinner then two dvds put together. And of course, the movies are great!",1390867200,,188,4.108108108108108
4566592,5,B00543R3WG,Got a great deal on ALL of the Harry Potters. I was waiting on something like this to come up and finally It showed up. It's as advertised basically all 8 movies on DVD not all the special disc extras. Just as you would of bought them in the store for a normal copy. So if your looking for all the behind the scenes and extra hours never been seen stuff this probably isn't the set your looking for. That will cost you twice the amount you pay for these. If your like me and just loved the Harry Potter movies and want to own all of them to actually watch the movies and not much more than this is the box set for you.,1390867200,,618,3.952
4566593,4,B00543R3WG,"Seems as if the movies are the cut TV versions rather than the full length original versions. Maybe I am wrong, but seems there are scenes missing from the big screen movie versions, which are what I expected to get.",1390867200,,216,4.425
4566594,5,B00543R3WG,Duh. Best movies ever. A must have for Harry potter fans. I am so happy they are all bundled into one package :),1390780800,,112,3.9130434782608696
4566595,5,B00543R3WG,"My mom bought this for my sister for Christmas and we love it! Had a HP marathon for a couple of days. Arrived a few days after we ordered it and all the discs are there, no scratches on them.",1390780800,,192,3.825
4566596,5,B00543R3WG,Purchased for my daughter.  She loved it!  Great gift item and the price was awesome!  Would totally recommend to others,1390780800,,120,4.9
4566597,5,B00543R3WG,What can I say? The Harry Potter series is fun and meaningful. Plenty of action. Easy to recommend this set.,1390780800,,108,4.45

4566599,1,B00543R3WG,"This version of Harry Potter is horrible, it is almost like a black-market version has been slipped into the stockpile for the complete collection of Harry Potter. The video quality was horrible, my DVD copies are 100X better, and everything inside looks like it had been photo-copied... beware.",1390608000,,295,5.166666666666667
4566600,3,B00543R3WG,considering it was used it was worth the money. it sticks on scenes sometimes. have to skip scenes a lot. that's pretty much it,1390608000,,127,4.333333333333333
4566601,5,B00543R3WG,Our first purchase at Amazon was this one and we do not hesitate to buy it we're Harry Potter Fans and we always see movies series over and over....,1390608000,,148,4.137931034482759
4566612,5,B00543R3WG,I was quite happy with my purchase.  We were in the middle of a Harry Potter marathon over holiday break and only had up to episode 5.  Looked around for the other to rent but couldn't find.  I was surprised by the price and signed up for the trial of Amazon Prime so shipping was quick.  We finished out marathon and I finally found out what happened in the end.,1390608000,,363,4.142857142857143
4566613,5,B00543R3WG,What to say my granddaughter loved the set. She is 8 and was recently introduced to Harry Potter. She fell in love with the series. Has watched every movie and is reading the first book.,1390608000,,186,4.3428571428571425
4566614,3,B00543R3WG,"It would be 5, but when I bought this I didn't expect them to just take disc one out of all eight movies package it together and call it the complete set.  There are no bonus features for most of these, as it is on disc two.  I wish they had specified this.  Made me a very unhappy customer.",1390608000,,291,3.8983050847457625

4566616,5,B00543R3WG,"I absolutely love Harry Potter, and I wanted the Wizards Collection when it released, back in September of 2012 but thought that the price was outrageous. I had hoped, that they would come out with a cheaper collection. I was sure shocked when I saw this collection! You are basically getting the Wizards Collection, without the added stuff, and the box. You still get the 31 Disc Set, and for those of you who want just the movies on Blu-ray, they have an 8 Disc Collection for either Blu-ray or DVD. But if you are waiting for the collection to be either cheaper or less discs, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the final collection of Harry Potter that they will release seeing as this is an Amazon exclusive and the Wizards Collection was supposed to be the last set Warner Bros. was going to release.",1390521600,21,806,4.489795918367347
4566617,5,B00543R3WG,"Gosh, this was such a great deal.  I bought it as my ""black Friday"" gift to myself.  I'd been buying the DVDs separately & used.  Now I have all 8 movies in the collection brand new.",1390521600,,182,4.0

4566652,4,B00543R3WG,The movies themselves were good and Blu-ray quality and all that jazz.  Only complaint is that it doesn't come with any of the extras you might get if you purchase the individual one (behind the scenes stuff and whatnot) but if you don't care about that then this is a 5/5 for sure!,1390262400,,282,4.320754716981132

I purchased the same box set at WalMart and they are not correct either and Walmart checked all 4 box sets that they have at my local store and they all are wrong which means that the problem is with the distributor.  The same distributor must supply WalMart and Amazon.  My problem now is where can I purchase a correct box set?",1390176000,3,570,4.349056603773585

I immediately returned the item for a replacement, and when the replacement arrived IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. It is amazing that such a defect would be so pervasive in this product.

I'm a patient dude and wanted to wait to own them all in one decent collection. Why can't we get something in between the 8 disc movie only set and the 31 disc sets with useless DVDs.

This collection does have all 8 films but the distributors have cut out all the fun scenes. It seems they've cut scenes from most of the movies, to save on time. The overall story lines weren't altered but the movies without the fun scenes are a little boring to watch. I don't recommend this set, you get about 75% of the original films, just enough to keep the story intact.

4566698,2,B00543R3WG,"I'm a big fan of box sets and packaging, so I was disappointed that the physical disks aren't exactly a set. It's more like they had extra disks from the original printing and they just threw them in here. The half blood prince even says ""disk1"" without any disk2.
Also, we're watching the Deathly Hollows1 now and it's skipping like crazy -- like it's got a big fat scratch on it. Booo",1389657600,,386,4.375

There are other sets that come with plenty of ""extras"" but are much more expensive.  The pleasant surprise was that these movies still did come with special features, not a lot, but more than expected.  Since the first few movies were made before Blu-ray & HD were streamlined, they don't have HD sound (or whatever the technical terms are) according to my much more tech savvy husband, but this doesn't bug us as the sound (like the acting) improves with each movie.",1389657600,,579,4.647058823529412

There are no special features, it is just the movies. For some reason, a few of the disks started to play right away without having me push play. Not a big deal, just thought I would mention it if you are intending to walk out of the room!
 One disk confused us by starting with an unlabeled ""Polar Express"" preview. This was the third or fourth disk (none of the others had any previews) so at first I thought it was the wrong movie! Just kind of weird so I thought I would mention that too.",1389571200,2,596,4.008403361344538

I have never read any of the books nor watched one movie of Harry Potter. So the Mrs one day told me she loved Harry Potter and seen like one maybe two movies. So when I came across this on sale and complete collection and on  BluRay I decided to jump on it and order this collection. So after I have received the collection I literally watched a movie a day, one right after the other and man I do have to say could not get enough, I was so impressed with the movie and it so left me wanting more, I literally love this movie completely and it got me reading the books now. I'm now such a huge fan. Great Movie Completely!!! 2 Thumbs Up if I had 4 thumbs I would give it just that...",1389571200,,834,3.93491124260355

I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas so he could watch the movies from his X-Box. We were not aware the X-Box would not accommodate Blu-Ray and returned it for the regular DVD version.  My return was accepted BUT was told a 26% restocking fee had been deducted from the refund!!! While Amazon's return policies state that they have no control over their outside sources fees, there is NO mention of restocking fees on the product page much less that outrageous amount.  Had I been made aware of restocking fees on the PRODUCT PAGE I would have not ordered it; or had the fees been more REASONABLE, I would have borne no ill will.  Now I am very angry and upset with both Amazon and the shipper as you can probably tell..BUYER BEWARE certainly holds true...as to the regular DVD set, grandson is thoroughly enjoying the collection.",1389398400,2,977,4.630057803468208

4566775,4,B00543R3WG,"I enjoyed watching the ""Harry Potter"" films during their first-runs in the theaters, and again on Blu-ray.

It was something of a surprise to see and hear how *young* the actors and actresses were at the beginning of the films when compared to the last film. The earlier films didn't quite add up to how I remembered them in the theater, but the mid- and late-stage films did. Characters that stood out to me  aside from the ""core"" three  included, but were not limited to, Dumbledore, Ginny Weasley, Hagrid, the Malfoys and, of course, Voldemort.

One last note: I haven't had time to read the books the movies are based on, but if the films are any indication, the books should be on par or even better than the movies. After all, it's common knowledge that films often sacrifice the ""smaller"" aspects of book-based stories in order to fit into a 2-hour or so viewing timeframe.

4566793,5,B00543R3WG,"Since all the reviews for several versions of the product all end up on the same page, let me start off saying I got the 11 disc Blu-ray set. I'll also use this review to set aside any misguidings others have posted about. I'll admit I was a bit worried ordering this, but I had positive hopes I was wrong.

This set is UK Region Free (you can tell by the movie ratings, as they're not MPAA ratings). They come in four plastic containers in a cardboard enclosure, with two movies to a container. The first five movies aren't true Blu-ray (with menus, etc), they're the movies in Blu-ray format, with some special features available. The quality is still superb. Once you get to movies 6, 7, and 8 you get a real Blu-ray experience with menus for other Blu-ray options, as well as a second disc of special features (one movie disc and one special features disc for movies 6, 7, and 8).

My only gripe is that there are two movies in a thick plastic case over a single movie in a slim case (such as how the Star Trek movie Blu-ray collection is packaged), but that's just me. The discs all work perfectly fine. This is definitely the complete set to order if you want just the movies and some special features, and not spend hundreds on a ""collectors case"" with stuff you'll only look at once.",1388620800,4,1291,4.375

I bought this for my wife who is a huge Harry Potter fan.  We own the collection on DVD already, but I thought that owning it on Blu-ray would be a nice treat.  We are extremely disappointed.  The picture quality of these discs is in some cases worse than the DVD versions we own.  There isn't a master audio track or even an HD audio track.  There aren't even any disc menus!

It also has another tremendously important element -- a good plot, a well-developed story. Many people, of my acquaintance, have criticized this series because of the inclusion of magic.

Even though it doesn't come with the extras like the cute trunk or behind the scenes stuff, it's still a great collection (Films 1-8) to have for a great price. The movies don't come in individual cases. Instead, it's similar to a book with each movie disc having a single ""page."" It's cool flipping through it.

Knowing i wouldn't be able to get all of them to read the books, this was the next best thing!  They've all since watched some of the movies and acknowledge that it's a pretty good series and entertaining to watch.

If you love The Harry Potter movies and are looking for the collection on blu ray that you can pop in the disk player and watch when you want, then this is it.  They were packaged in a disc holder that takes up about as much room as 2 average blu ray disks clamshell side-by-side.  I don't write a lot of reviews on my purchases, but this was perfect.

My DVD of The Hobbit did this when I bought it too. I traded it for a different one, and it still did it. Are DVD's getting more carelessly produced or is it just me?",1386460800,,414,4.048780487804878

The audio quality and video quality of the films are top notch and as you would expect from a BluRay film. The disks all come in a double wide 8 Disk case and has a card board slip cover. The cardboard slip cover is very well made, sturdy and has a foil effect thats pleasing to look at. The disk case is also well made, doesn't feel cheap and should last a lifetime. I was disappointed by the disks themselves. The disks were clearly just reused from the standalone titles so they don't feature a unified theme generally found in boxed collections. Some of the disks even say Disk 1 or Disk 2 further showing that the disks were just reused from the stand alone set. I was really disappointed WB didn't take the time to reprint the disks for this collection and it makes the collection feel they didn't take the the and pushed it out the door.",1386115200,6,925,4.3526011560693645

4566947,5,B00543R3WG,"Eight films for seven volumes. The whole saga in these films. A real treat.

The second beautiful things is that the same actors are used for the main children characters through the eight films, hence over the long period of time it took to produce them. We see the kids becoming teens and twinks under our own eyes and that is also realistically satisfying. They might have been slightly too old at the beginning but they are truly their age at the end.

Then the films being a lot more concentrated than the books, some elements come out a lot stronger, to a very critical point. The fact that Harry Potter is an orphan is very strongly emphasized by the films and his uncle foster-father along with his cousin foster-brother are ridiculous, made ridiculous, overdone in the ridiculous line, probably slightly too much in the line of too much. They should be pathetic and appear cruelly sadistic and they only look clownish and farcical.

The films also concentrate slightly too much on the fact that Harry Potter is a young teenager and then a young man who is attached to men of all sorts. The story as it is revealed in the end clearly identifies his fate to the decisions of a few men and to the fate of these few men. The only woman that has counted in his life was his own mother who saved him from annihilation with her own love and nothing else. This vision of Harry Potter being a man of many men is very sexist in a way and this world of wizardry is very sexist in all kinds of ways and it is not the Weasley sister and Hermione who save the story from being a mans story for men and only men. Girls and women just have to look, watch, admire and applaud but they have no real role to play, or hardly some ancillary roles here and there, like cleaning the teacups. The books were slightly less sexist and we could have expected the films to change that kind of bias.

Harry Potter is entirely dependent on Dumbledore who never tells him the truth and that his fate has been decided by three men: Voldemort who wants to kill him to be unique and sole master in the world, Dumbledore and Snape who want to bring Harry Potter to his resurrection in order for him to destroy Voldemort, because Harry Potter can only do that if Voldemort tries to kill him and succeeds, though he will only kill in Harry Potter the part of himself, Voldemort, he had invested in the kid when he tried to kill him the first time when a baby. This Voldemort share in Harry Potter is represented by the scar on his forehead. Snape and Dumbledore knew that but they never told Harry Potter who finally knows when he is able to recuperate the tears of Snape before he dies when killed by Voldemort and these tears reveal this secret  when dropped I n the special secret reader in Dumbledores office.

That makes three men, and two will have to die for Harry Potters Voldemort part to be killed by Voldemort and for Harry Potter then to be able to kill the third man of this triad.

Three more men are necessary for Harry Potter to survive through it all. These three more men save him in the nick of time three times. In the Goblet of Fire he is saved by the sacrifice of another student who is killed by Voldemort and it is this death that enables Harry Potter to escape the same fate thanks to the intervention of the sword of his school house. He is saved by Ron Weasly when he is trying to recuperate the sword of his school house in an ice-locked river. He is saved in his last fight against Voldemort when another boy is able to recuperate that sword in the ruins of the school and to cut off the head of Voldemorts snake, which makes Voldemort decompose and fall down into a pile of ashes.

When you add to these two triple sets the giant Hagrid in the back of all these men you have it nearly all since you should also see the short-lived and evanescent role of Harry Potters godfather Black who will be important all along, or nearly, since his elf will be crucial in the seventh and last episode when Harry Potters is trying to bring together the three Deadly Hallows that will bring Voldemort down.

Only two maybe three women are important: Mrs Weasley, Rons mother, in her great motherly quality essentially knitting pullovers for the boys. Then Hermione who is a mixed blood and will be divided between Ron and Harry all along, though she will marry Ron in the end. And Rons sister who will eventually marry Harry in the end. Both marriages produce children, with a third one in the back: the son of the Slitheryn opponent to Harry Potter who nearly ended up as a direct servant of Voldemort, and Harry produces a boy with a triple name, two given names and Potter, the two given names representing the main men who supported Harry in his adventures.

On the other hand there are many nasty men of  course to balance the important good men, but there are a lot more nasty women that make the image of women in this film very negative. At the same time they can never be at the top and have the upper hand. No matter how nasty these women may be they can only be second fiddlers to Voldemort of course, second fiddlers he can dispose of at absolutely any time.

These films make the ternary pattern even stronger than we could expect as if we were reliving the chase for the Holy Grail and its Christian Trinity. The final fight is between Harry, Voldemort and Voldemorts snake, though the snake is fighting against Ron and Hermione and it is when the third student arrives with the sword and kills the snake that Harry Potter can succeed. Such ternary patterns are numerous.

Harrys mother is married to Harrys father but Snape is in love with Harrys mother and Harry has the same protection against Dementors as Snape, a doe. Harry is the son of his father and his mother but he carries some part of Voldemort in him and hence has three parents. Voldemort will have to kill his own contribution in Harry to become killable by Harry, provided he has some help from a triad of students behind, but Voldemort can only have the opportunity to do so if Dumbledore and Snape are killed, if possible Dumbledore by Snape and then Snape by Voldemort.

Finally in the end Harry Potter has  with some help from three friends  killed Voldemort and he has recuperated the famous wand that was in Dumbledores possession and then had been stolen by Voldemort from Dumbledores own grave. Harry Potter, as the third owner, destroys it. It will not have a fourth owner and Harry Potter has three reasons to do it: He cannot possess it (and you possess a wand only if that wand chooses to be possessed by you) because only someone who has killed the person he loves can possess this wand. Dumbledore had killed his own sister? Voldemort had killed so many people he should have loved but he never loved anyone anyway, and thus he cant possess it as he says himself to Snape who is the proper owner because he killed Dumbledore who he loved. Harry Potter had not killed one single person he loved. The second reason is that this wand being destroyed is a promise of peace, thus the end of these adventures. The third reason is that Harry Potter refuses power and that is the decision of the author, Ms Rowling who has decided to bury Harry Potter in some kind of ossified and frozen ice conservatory out of which she will never take him.

A shameful decision for an author. Of course the films are clearly showing there is a next generation with Harry Potters own son, but that is a promise Ms Rowling does not seem to be willing to follow so far. The films are promising it but the book did not and the author is trying to entertain and distract herself in some social oriented novels and crime stories that are far from being in any way able to compete with the great masters of these genres.

The films are a great saga but it is to be regretted the saga has been stopped by its author who is trying to play writer in, fields she does not really control.

A last remark on Daniel Radcliffe. He is a great child-actor and we can see him growing but he is developed as a very stiff character, static in expression and action. That is a handicap in this profession. He could have learned how to be active and how to build a real rich and passionate character he would impersonate in its deepest feelings and emotions since he is far from being a child in the last films and his character is old enough not to be a child any more and become a passion ate teenager. He cant satisfy himself with being that stiff and cold an actor forever. Methinks he could have been directed better in the last three or four films.

Right after I got this, I spent an entire month in Harry Potter land.  Every day after work, and on the weekends, I would play all of the movies over and over again, start to finish.  I even bought a variety of candy to go along with the initial train ride to Hogwarts.

Many years ago, I was given the first 4 books as a birthday present.  At first I didn't think I was going to like them, but apparently my parents know me much better than I do in some areas.  They were absolutely right to get me those books because even though I was 25 years old at the time, they became some of my favorite books ever.

4566993,5,B00543R3WG,I bought this for halloween because I actually hadn't seen the last two movies. This is a great collection. The movies looked amazing and were amazing. The first four movies for some reason start right into the movie when you put them in and the last four go to menus.. which I through was weird but it didn't bother me.,1382745600,,320,4.35
4566994,1,B00543R3WG,The plastic cover was broken and the CDs will not stay in. This was not noticed until taken out of the box set. I gave this as a gift and felt horrible after they opened it.

Meaning it seems like they just pieced together a box set, and didn't make the 8 discs exclusively for this set. If that matters to you, it didn't matter to me. I love it. We do Harry Potter marathons now and then and it fit our needs just right. I am not going to give it a five star rating because of the mismatched discs.",1382400000,2,420,4.197530864197531

The box set is great because it doesn't take up much space, but holds every single movie.

4567010,5,B00543R3WG,I was so excited when this came. The insert that holds the blue ray's is a little bit sketchy but nothing to fret over. I was very impressed with all of the features that came on most of the discs. The Deathly Hallows did not have these additional features and it seemed like the menus on these discs didn't 'mesh' with the way the others were set up but overall I am very happy! It arrived in about a week with the free shipping and was packaged nicely.,1381536000,,454,4.170454545454546

4567015,5,B00543R3WG,"It's all the Harry Potters...in a single set...in HD - need I say more? Amazon had the best price I could find and it arrived quickly (of course).

My 7 y/o and I have thoroughly enjoyed working our way through this set - it's been a neat bonding experience. Harry's tale obviously became darker and more intense the further it went on. I deliberately held off on getting this set until I felt my 7 y/o could grasp most of the material...and not be too freaked out by the scary stuff. I wouldn't personally show it to any kids under 7ish - but your kids (and child rearing techniques) may vary.

I can't really comment on the special features, etc...we've only focused on the actual movies so far.",1381363200,,697,4.4375

He clamed it was the British version. He gave me like a whole essay on why he sent me the British one and how its better. I thought that was odd. Also, I thought it was strange that he didn't put in a return label. I got my money back and just sent it back right away. I didn't want to chance it.

I found nothing wrong with the books or movies, and I fell in love with the world of Harry Potter.  (Although religion isn't addressed in the book, there is the universal theme of good versus evil; love triumphs over hate; and self sacrifice for others is the ultimate Christ symbol, so I had no problem reconciling my faith with the books/movies.)  My individual DVD's were getting ragged (I can watch the movies numerous times), so I wanted an entire set.

4567181,5,B00543R3WG,I bought these as a Potter fan and wondered how the quality would be.  It's great!

I love the books and the movies, but buying all the movies suits me better than buying all the books. I'm so glad I made this purchase!

The DVDs come in a case that holds all of them, then that case slides into a slipcover.

All the movies were widescreen (I saw a complaint on another review about a change in format, but all of mine were the same).

4567219,5,B00543R3WG,"Update 6/3/15: This review was originally posted in 2013 under a listing for the UK Boxed Set that has since been removed by Amazon. I have deleted that review and re-posted it under the current listing. Please note this was written prior to the release of the Hogwarts Collection, which is why that set is not referenced in my review. That said, my opinion and recommendation of UK set remains unaffected. Original review follows:

This review is specifically for the UK Blu-Ray set, which is Region-Free and ""should"" play on any North American Blu-Ray player. For the record, I have a North American 120GB PS3 Slim, and all of the discs, movies and special features alike, played flawlessly.

Two things in particular attracted me to this collection over its US counterpart. First of all, it's cheaper. The price of the US set has come down in recent months, but this one is still less expensive as of this writing. Better still, there is more content in the UK version. For those of you who don't know, this set is basically a compilation of the individual releases of each film. While the first five films were released as single discs, the last three were 2-disc sets (with, as you might expect, the movie on the first disc and the special features on the second). The US version omits the special features discs for the last three films, but they are included here. Now, obviously, this collection is not as comprehensive as the Ultimate Editions or the Wizard's Collection. There are no extended cuts or 3D versions here, and since the early films were limited to single discs, the extras are somewhat lacking. But for the more casual Harry Potter fan like myself, you're getting all you probably need for under $50. FYI, as of this writing, it is actually slightly on Amazon UK than it is here, including shipping.

I have no complaints about the video quality of these discs. I'm sure the early films would've benefited from having separate discs for the special features thereby allowing for a higher bit-rate for the movies themselves, but they look fine. The later films, having more room to breathe as well as simply being newer, look fantastic. I have yet to experience the lossless audio options as I have an older A/V receiver, but the lossy Dolby Digital and DTS tracks sound great for what they are.

I will say that the packaging could have been better. The set comes in a cardboard slipcase housing four Blu-Ray cases containing two movies each. This is fine, but the hinges on the disc trays are a bit flimsy and the fourth case, which houses the two Deathly Hallows movies, is unnecessarily thick with a lot of empty space for the discs to be jostled around and become dislodged during shipping. Fortunately, this didn't happen to me, but I'm sure it easily could have.

That minor complaint aside, I couldn't be happier with this purchase and would recommend this collection to anyone who wants the Harry Potter movies but can't justify the expense of the Ultimate Editions or the Wizard's Collection.",1373760000,,3024,4.752380952380952

Good examples are Star Wars in the SF category and Lord of the Rings in fantasy. These are movies in my opinion that draw in both adults as well as children a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. The Harry Potter 8 film collection is one of these types of movies good for the whole family. I recommend it for the whole family.,1373673600,,443,4.223529411764706

4567251,2,B00543R3WG,"Most blu ray movies run between 20 mbps to over 30 mbps. Regular dvds run about 5 mbps. These run between 5 mbps and 20 mbps, and average about 10 mbps. There quality is at the lowest end of the spectrum. These are from England. For instance instead  of  The Sorcerer's Stone, Its The Philosopher's stone. Even the script is different.

4567253,5,B00543R3WG,"I had previously purchased or received as gifts the prior 6 movies on DVD - most wide-screen but I think one gift was a full screen version.  I decided I'd like a Blu-ray copy but they were usually around $70 or more for the set so never bought it and I actually had not seen the Deathly Hallows either.  After receiving a gift card I figured what the heck, I'll go ahead and get the 11 disc set that was available at a more reasonable price.  Here's what I noticed after watching all the movie discs (I pretty much had to so I'd remember everything and also to verify the disc were good).

First the breakdown of the 11 disc - as mentioned they come in a ""box"" that isn't high quality but does the job of keeping the four cases together in a group.  The four cases are labeled so you can see which ""years"" are included in the case.  Two of the cases have two disc each, one has years 1 & 2 while the other has years 3 and 4.  The third case has years 5 and 6 with a special features disc for year 6 (Half-blood Prince).  Finally, there's the largest case that holds year 7 part 1 & 2 and the special features for both so a total of 4 discs in this last case.  All of my discs had labels and I didn't have the blank or black label mentioned in other reviews.

Quality of movies on Blu-ray - I'd say the first few movies seemed more like DVD copies and the sound was not as good as my LOTR Blu-ray collection.  The later movies seemed better but perhaps that's to be expected with the first movie being from 2001 and the last movie around 2011?

As I mentioned in the 11 discs breakdown, only the last three movies have the special features disc included.  The others have minor special features  like trailers, deleted/extended scenes, some actors talking about their characters and such.  I also believe the Half-Blood Prince had the ""Enhanced"" movie playback feature but am pretty sure the Deathly Hallows did not.  I'd also mentioned on the first few movies I think they just went right into play mode so if you want to get to the menu you have to use the remote to bring it up to view the minor features or wait until the movie is over and then forward through the credits.  Being the ""All"" regions versions means you will see a lot more warnings about the copyright as the screen is shown in multiple languages.

So if you are looking for the complete set, don't care too much about having a ton of special features for each movie or if you want a region free version, then this may be the best option for you.  However if you like extended version and want more than you would have seen at the theater or just want to see all the special features or have an attractive storage box/case, then you'll have to look elsewhere.",1372982400,5,2728,4.251937984496124

After reading some of the negative reviews, I decided to take my chances and get it, and I am so glad that I did! It came in a couple days (with Amazon Prime), and the price was fantastic! $40 for 8 DVDs... how can you complain? Within a week I had watched all eight movies and encountered zero problems with this collection. Each disc was in the box with its corresponding movie poster image on the disc. The menus are not simply still images, they are moving menus with music. The movies all played perfectly fine. As for what people have said about special features or lack thereof... that part doesn't really matter to me. There are a few, which I haven't checked out yet, but remember, many of the ""behind-the-scenes"" and interviews with the cast are available for free on YouTube! The movies in their entirety are not, and I bought this set purely for the movies. If you ARE, however, looking for a ton of bonus features, then spend a lot more money on a different collection. If, like me, you just want to have the movies to watch (over and over... and over), then this set is a GREAT deal and one of the best purchases I have made.

REVISION: I have since writing the original review found that subtitles do exist for all of the movies.  Subtitles for ""The Deathly Hollows"" part 1 and part 2 are found as a tab under ""Languages"" as normally found (I hadn't viewed either of these at the time of the original review).  Subtitles for the other six movies can be located in the drop-down menu that contains choices for the aspect ratio and display items.  For me, the blue tag marked ABC was the selection that turned on/off the subtitles.  The quality of the movies that I did play were clearly up to ""Blu-Ray"" quality, with each of the movies, up to the Deathly Hollows pair, the movie disc contained options to view the movie's associated ""special features"" and a number of related interviews that were interesting. Both of the Deathly Hollows movies had a separate ""special features"" disc.  I have upgraded my evaluation of this set to four stars, from three stars, as finding the subtitle ""switch"" made a big improvement in my enjoyment and satisfaction with this movie set.",1370304000,3,1278,4.764705882352941

Seeing as how in 1997, I was the prime age (7th grade) to enjoy such a book I have no idea why I waited so long!

But, I'm glad, at the wonderful age of 26, that I finally got into it and it is quite honestly my favorite book series of all time. What a fantastic story and SERIOUSLY MAGICAL MOVIES.

The set itself holds a few disappointments with the quality of the earlier movies. They are far from unacceptable, but they are certainly NOT blu-ray definition, although they bear the blu-ray label.  Maybe that's as good as it gets for the older ones?  Seems to me like those movies are recent enough that they should be able to be presented much better than they are.

Personally I enjoyed being able to watch the entire series as the characters grew from kids to adults, rather than watching a string of different actors portray the different ages.  I guess that is one thing unique to this collection...continuity beyond compare.",1366070400,,560,5.032608695652174

4567441,5,B00543R3WG,"""Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection""

Over the Spring break my family indulged in a Harry Potter film festival, watching all eight movies in the course of a few days. It was great. I was an adult reader of the first book, and made my way through the whole series, even with the tedium at the end. My wife and I saw the first couple of movies together when they came out, but then gave up after that - the first film didn't have the same magic as the book, and the second was just a little too cutesy and coy for my tastes. Maybe we were just too old for this stuff.

Anyway, fast forward a decade or so and here we are with a kid whose life is saturated with Potter, Spidey and Star Wars and we figured it was time to just go for it... so break out the popcorn and hand me the remote!

It was a great viewing experience, and frankly, more fun than the books, especially the later volumes in the series. At some point the literary enterprise and the Hollywood phenomenon became closely entwined and Ms. Rowling clearly began writing her books almost as if they were production notes for the films. And, as it turns out, that was just fine. ""The Deathly Hallows"" is a terrible book -- uneventful, dreary, repetitive and full of lifeless exposition -- but the screen version, especially taken in the context of the other films, is quite good. Indeed, watching all the movies together in a short time period was a potent experience, making the characters and their losses and growth more resonant and powerful -- the transitions from childhood to maturity, and the purposeful changes in emotional tone from film to film are more easily seen as part of a purposeful and elegant mosaic. Although Rowling (arguably) may have dropped the ball on the books, her overall vision for the saga comes through well in these films and although Harry remains a relatively flat character, the tragedy and complexity of Severus Snape is impressive in such a mega-mainstream entertainment juggernaut. Chris Columbus's formulaic direction of the first two films threw me off the scent many years ago, but I'm glad I came back to it now. It's a worthwhile journey.

Don't hesitate, I found this collection on Amazon while standing at Best Buy. It was $30.00 cheaper on Amazon at the time and I'm so glad I shopped around first.",1363478400,,539,4.294117647058823

The only let down for me, is that I waited a long time to order the series hoping they would give me the extended versions. I have watched all of the movies on television. Often they are the extended version, with several scenes not usually shown.

I've seen a few people complaining about their discs being messed up or different and all I have to say is that is unusual and probably just a glitch in the printing for the discs or something. All eight of my movies were printed and etched correctly, all are widescreen, and all play just fine.

4567525,3,B00543R3WG,"If this rating were based on the movies alone, I'd give this 4.5 stars hands-down.  The films are very well shot, lit, dressed, acted, etc etc etc.  While I would have liked a little more depth on some points, I get that not everything can be covered in a film based on a book.

My major complaint is in the 'Special Features"" aspect.

I specifically got the 11 disc version of this, as the 30+ disc version is just too much money.  I don't know what WB is playing at for making a set so expensive and the only way to get the bonus footage.  The first five movies had very little bonus content worth talking about, most of it games and gimmicks, and very little truly behind the scenes footage.  The final 3 had a bit more, but they also had a separate blu-ray of 'bonus footage' for each.  I don't even think there was 1.5 hours on average of decent, well thought footage, and only a couple of the spots were truly gripping (the ones dealing with JK Rowling mostly) and insightful.

Being a long-time LOTR fan, and having owned the first extended trilogy they released (4 discs per film, 12 discs total), and the second set on blu-ray (5 discs per film, 15 discs total), and only costing $60 for the latest set, that's about $20/film.  I'd have gladly paid $160ish for some real bonus footage, but I don't think it actually exists.  In the LOTR set, they walk through the making of the films, starting with the birth of JRRT, all the way to the final release of the third film (111 years of info, only 6-7 in a studio, you had 10 years), and that's only 6 of the 9 bonus discs- the last 3 are a documentary on each film.  It covers every single aspect of the films.

I paid $8/film, I'd say it was a deal. I'd also say I'm stuck, because the only edition currently available with more footage is $350ish ($43/film) and I'm not willing to part with that (read the reviews- others that love bonus footage were also disappointed).  So thanks WB for a full set of the films, but maybe next time you do a big release, like this, take some notes from the folks over at New Line.  They've got their act together on how to release a box set.  In fact, so does Fox (Star Wars), Paramount (Indie Jones), Disney/Pixar (Up, Toy Story, pretty much everything), Dreamworks (everything) and you actually did on your Kubrick set.  How did you manage to let one of the longest running film series fall apart on such a monumental release on the highest quality home-viewing platform fall apart like this?  If you do another one properly, it'd be nice, and I'll need to see some seriously positive reviews first.",1362873600,,2594,4.391213389121339

The cinematography is vivid and sophisticated. Which leads me to my only disappointment with this BluRay collection: Some of the movies don't seem to be BluRay resolution. I feel like I'm watching a DVD in some cases. I've nonetheless rated it 4 stars.

For those who are budget conscious, I'd think that buying the DVDs and watching them on an upconverting DVD player would give the same results as I'm seeing on this BluRay version of Harry Potter movies.

After watching the BBC nature series on BluRay in eye-popping HD, I am hooked on seeing things just as the photographer saw them. In the case of the Potter series, I expected to see the films at home on my 1080p HDTV looking as sharp as they do in the theater.

Sadly, you will not get the ""theater"" experience with these BluRays. Some discs are better than the others, and the quality varies from scene to scene.

Overall, a great story with excellent cinematography, but disappointing resolution.",1362182400,,1166,4.839195979899498

The regular 8 film Blu-ray collection seemed like a quickly thrown together, cheap set. Many reviews said the same thing. So, I did what some other customers suggested, I got the UK version.

This is definitely the way to go. The UK film collection is of a better quality and costs less than the American version. It is region free so it plays on all Blu-ray players. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can do the same with the DVD collection because those are all region locked.

This is more affordable and just all around better value. It even has bonus features, which I love.

The only thing is that if you are expecting special bonus features or anything, it won't be in this. It's just the movies. So the games and stuff that come on the second disc in the individual films isn't included.

4567575,4,B00543R3WG,"This is a great box set. They get rid of the senseless papers and 8 different blu-ray cases to give you an easy-to-access, bare essential package. The first 5 movies are presented without a menu (hence the 4-star rating). Menus are one of my favorite things about Blu-Ray and DVD's, so having the movie automatically start was kind of lame. Even worse when I noticed the ""Menu"" text is barely readable and the awful yellow color hurts my eyes when watching on my smaller TV.

Movies 6, 7, and 8 have menus. The special features for all three of the final films are quite lackluster in comparison to what was offered with 1-5.

1-5 Special Features consist of interviews with cast and crew, behind the scenes shots, cool interviews and character profiles.
6-8 Special Features consist of watching the movie with ""Maximum Viewing Mode"" or something. It basically plays the movie in the background and instead of commentary, you see actual actors, producers, directors etc. talking about the film. It's okay, but not as interesting as straight commentary would have been.

For what it's worth, the collection is great. The movies look crisp and visually pleasing when viewing on my 52"" Plasma TV. The sound for the films is great, except for the last 2 films which tend to have louder action scenes and quieter dialogue.

I contacted Amazon and since it's been a while since we ordered the box set there's no desire to assist us with getting the correct disc.  We've skipped ahead to disc 4 and so far it's as advertised.  We'll see if we get any more mystery movies out of this.

4567663,5,B00543R3WG,"I'm still not seeing the flaws some people have complained about here.  The outer box is basic, but not really cheap or flimsy.  The individual disc cases and labels are perfectly adequate.  I suppose they could be even more fancy and elaborate...but do I really care?  No.

I have no complaints about the quality of the discs or the playback.  With the first five discs the movie does start right up when you insert the disc, rather than going first to a menu screen.  Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 have proper menus that come up first, and separate special features discs with more and better extras.  But there *are* bonus features on the first five discs--trailers, deleted scenes, short interviews with cast and crew, the usual stuff.  You can access them by pressing the ""disc menu"" button on your remote, or you can sit through all the multi-lingual anti-piracy warnings after the end credits--the menu will pop up.  I imagine there would be more goodies on the deluxe edition discs, but I didn't pay the cost of the deluxe edition, did I?  If you're looking at this set I'm betting a lot of you don't want to, either.

I think this *is* the region-free version that other reviewers are recommending that you order from Amazon.co.uk.  The URL printed on the disc cases is warnerbros.co.uk.  The age rating symbols on the box are the ones awarded by the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office.  After each movie ends, you see dozens of anti-piracy warnings, in every language under the sun--I've never seen that on a US version DVD.  Also, everywhere in the first film--on the packaging, on the disc, in the titles, in the dialog--they refer to the ""philosopher's stone"" rather than the ""sorcerer's stone.""  (The original UK book title was ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" but the US publisher thought that would put off American readers, so they dumbed it down to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.""  They did the same with the movie so as not confuse fans of the book.  But they only changed it in the US--everywhere else it was always ""Philosopher's Stone.""  Personally, I find having the movie with the original title a plus!)  The one thing I cannot find anywhere on the discs or packaging is the region code--but clearly, these are not the standard US editions.",1359504000,7,2343,4.778606965174129

4567696,3,B00543R3WG,"I bought this item as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  When we finally had a chance to play the first movie in the series last weekend, we were disappointed to find that the Blu-ray was apparently defective.  Within a minute of starting, the video began to pixelate and stop on occasion.  The audio cut out.  Eventually the movie just froze.  I went to Amazon to initiate a return of the item but stopped short because Amazon suggested I upgraded the firmware in my Blu-ray player.  I spent the next eight hours doing just that (don't ask - it involved networking the device, which it hadn't been before).  Anyway, I did upgrade the player and tried again.  Same outcome.  So I asked Amazon for a replacement and shipped the defective set back.

The replacement arrived very quickly (kudos to Amazon replacement policies and convenience of return shipment).  I just tried it and, lo and behold, the first movie worked - problem solved!  Well, not really.  I had noticed that the quality of the video wasn't really ""Blu-ray"" - more like SD  (I had noticed it in the first set too, but since it stopped playing entirely then, I attributed it to the disk being bad).  Could it be that the manufacturer of these disks simply converted SD-quality source movies to Blu-ray format?  Or was it that the initial Harry Potter wasn't available in Blu-ray resolution?  To test that theory, I decided to view the last movie in the series.  Since that had just come out in 2012, I figure it must surely be in full Blu-ray quality.  I put the disk in and got the error message ""This disk cannot be played""!  Oh no :-(

I know my Samsung Blu-ray player (purchased from Amazon) is not defective as it plays other Blu-ray movies, such as Blade Runner (also purchased from Amazon), just fine - I just checked to make sure.  Therefore, it must be this disk set.  Amazon should really have a word with the manufacturer about their quality control.  I don't seem to be the only one having difficulties with this set.  I gave up on this set.  Returning it today for a refund.

Update: I later also had trouble with all the Blu-ray discs I tried from Red Box.  This causes me to rethink that it was the discs, after all.  It looks like my Samsung BD-P1600 is just very picky about what Blu-ray discs it plays (maybe only the old style before BD-Live?)  Updated the star rating.",1358812800,,2359,4.534441805225653

4567728,4,B00543R3WG,"I purposefully waited until all the Harry Potter movies were released so that I could buy a complete set. I don't regret buying this set at all, because I mainly just wanted to own the movies, I was slightly disappointed that there were no (and I mean NO) special features whatsoever. I wasn't expecting hours long SF, but I thought each movie would come with at least one SF. Also, I don't know whether it's a special setting, but each of the movies started automatically playing after a certain amount of time on the DVD main menu screen, even when the movie had been watched already. Again, not a major complaint, just an observation.

All in all, I like that the set is small and doesn't take up an entire DVD shelf, but this is most definitely only the set for you if you want the movies and nothing else. There is nothing 'collectable' about it.",1358208000,,851,4.455128205128205

Another playing it freezes on another track).  And once it freezes everything is frozen.  I had to eject the disc and reload to get it playing again.  Sometimes they freeze multiple times.  Sigh.

The product doesn't contain much else other than the movies themselves, but if you don't have to have the biggest and baddest collection, who cares? These movies are great quality and play well. The discs work great in our player. A couple of the movies - Year 7 - appears to have special features, which is great!

It's a wonderful collection - it comes in a standard sleeve with 4 DVD cases - two DVDs per case. For example, the first and second films are in the same DVD case, and so on. The last film (both parts) are in a case of their own with what appears to be two special features discs.

4567800,4,B00543R3WG,Overall I was very happy with this product. I brought it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it. My only two complaints was that there aren't a lot of bonus features on the DVDs and when I received my DVD box set the part inside that allows you to rotate through the disks was broken making it hard to close. I didn't want to rate it to low though because it serves its purpose.,1357516800,,388,4.118421052631579

4567804,5,B00543R3WG,"Not a collectors item like others have said and not many extras, but still, 8 blue rays for this cheap is great.  I didn't want to spend $300 plus on the one with all the extras and nice case.

After I purchased this I saw reviews on this product about a cheaper set from the UK that had more features.  So if I were you I'd check that one out.  Just look through these comments, I'm sure you will find it.",1357430400,,406,3.9753086419753085

4567807,1,B00543R3WG,"The discs themselves were unplayable on my machine obviously designed to play only in the American region. The packaging was poor and arrived in a broken state. They were returned within 2 days.

I am very happy with the discs themselves and he loves having them.  My single complaint is that the inside tabs of the case broken within moments of being open.  Does it matter? No.  I'm ok with it.  The discs still stay safe inside and are contained.  For the price, it's great!!",1357344000,,420,4.111111111111111

The thrilling visuals and great surround sound gave us a good movie experience and the DVDs played flawlessly and looked and sounded great. That was 20 hours of great entertainment and we all enjoyed it. For the Harry Potter experience at a reasonable price this was a real bargain.,1357257600,,432,4.6103896103896105

The movies are brilliant and should be seen by everyone. The quality of the video and sound is as always great and those that want to show off what their systems are capable of should buy this. The only gripes I have with it is that some of the extras haven't been upgraded and that the final two movies aren't in 3D, not that I care that much.",1357171200,,470,3.957894736842105

4567849,5,B00543R3WG,"I honestly did not expect much given all the reviews that the product was sub-par with mismatched discs that only sometimes worked. I can tell you all of these reviews must really be outdated because my product was much better than described.

The case was a decently sturdy plastic case which inserts into a cardboard sleeve. All 8 discs worked beautifully. They were all the widescreen versions and all had the proper artwork on the discs (no blank covers or 'disc1' flubs).

5 stars given based on price. Are there bonus material discs? No. Are there other quality of life improvements that could be had? Yes. But this set gives you all movies for alittle over $3 a movie at the time of this writing and at that price range I cannot ask for more.",1357084800,,749,4.54074074074074

4567879,2,B00543R3WG,"We bought the Blu-Ray set as a Christmas gift, but had to return it.

The first disc had subtitles, even though we have subtitles disabled on our DVD player.  We had to wait for the DVD to play for awhile and then use the remote to manually turn the subtitles off.  This happened each and every time we tried to play the first disc.  None of the other discs had this particular issue, so it wasn't the DVD player.

The fourth and sixth discs didn't play right away.  I could hear the DVD player almost struggling to try to play the discs (which sounds weird, but I don't know how else to put it).  The player would stuggle for a minute, show an error-type screen I've never seen before, and then give up.  I had to push stop, eject the disc, reinsert it, and push play again before the discs would work.  None of the other discs had this problem, so again I know it's not my DVD player.

Of the 8 discs in the set, 3 didn't work correctly so I returned it and will buy a different set.  Amazon, as always, provided excellent customer service.",1356825600,,1042,4.238578680203045

There was no director commentary and access to the extras is pretty confusing. Another thing is that just because it's on Blu-Ray does NOT mean they are of higher film quality. They are just stored on Blu-Ray discs and not of high definition.",1356739200,,285,4.480769230769231

There was no bubble wrap or any type of protective material in the thin envelope to prevent this from happening.

After it arrived, I was surprised and pleased that the movie case was not a foot wide leviathan, but quite slim. Not much bigger than a standard movie case. As this was a gift and thus unopened by myself, I do wonder at how well protected the DVDs were, but oh well.

Its a great holiday treat to watch all the movies in progression. The actors grow and even though Ive seen it all several times before. Watching them all in the same week does make a huge difference in the overall story enjoyment.",1356652800,,466,4.682926829268292

4567904,2,B00543R3WG,"Bought this set on impulse at Costco a month or so ago. Just started watching them this past week. So far have watched the first 3 titles.

I use a PS3 as my blu-ray player. So far the first 3 titles have no menu. They just go right into the movie. My complaint is the audio and video quality. These are poor conversions. The video quality is not as good as streaming Vudu HDX. There was significant compression artifacts in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"". Kind of like what you would see on most streaming versions like Amazon or Netflix. Vudu HDX has nearly no compression artifacts.

The audio is another big disappointment. Where's the master, uncompressed audio that is supposed to be on blu-ray? I get plain old DD. I guess this goes along with the poor compressed video.

Bottom line, these discs are nothing more than slightly enhanced DVDs converted into pseudo blu-rays so that WB can make a few more bucks selling ""better"" versions.

If you already have the DVD versions save your money these are hardly an upgrade. If you don't have any you would be better off buying from Vudu, Apple or Amazon. At least then you get the ability to watch on portable devices.",1356652800,,1166,4.564593301435407

4567932,5,B00543R3WG,"Pros:
Minimalistic design -- doesn't need a lot of shelf space
Comes with a considerable amount of extras/bonus footage in each CD
PRICE.

Cons:
Some of the extras, especially in the earlier movies, are not in HD.

I think most of the negative reviews here are people expecting that this product will be something that it never was intended to be. Yes, it is a collection of the movies all in one package. Yes, you would've gotten the same product if you had bought it all separately. But, that's the point -- you get all of it in a minimalistic design and doesn't break the bank. No, you're not getting the ultra-special extras or any other bonus materials.

Also, there's a misconception that this set only has the movies, nothing else. This is simply untrue. The original discs themselves come with chock full of extras--Goblet of Fire alone has 1hr+ of bonus content on disc!

If you're looking for a great way to please yourself and/or the HP fan in your family, this is the go-to gift. You can also opt to wait or go for the real 'collector's sets' if you're a hardcore fan.",1356393600,,1080,4.523076923076923

4567943,4,B00543R3WG,"In this set, viewers will get all 8 Harry Potter films, in Blu-Ray and full HD quality.  If you enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and don't want tons of special features, this is the set for you.

The blu-ray discs do have some basic special features but, do not have the huge amount that the special edition collector sets might have.

This set is a great buy.  Every movie for a minimal price.

Now, in terms of quality, there are some issues with the set.  It isn't that all of the movies aren't in 1080p, however, the earlier movies were filmed at a time when HD and digital technology was in a newer stage.  So, the earlier movies, while they are scanned or transferred at 1080p, lack the polished, smooth and crisp look that the newer, more modern films have.  It isn't a problem per say, just a reality that a purchaser must be aware of.

The audio is great and the newer of the movies are absolutely stunning in HD quality.  The older movies do have some benefit from the transfer but, also some drawbacks as the older CG technologies do not appear to blend or composite quite as well, though only really noticeable to people who look for that kind of thing.

The stories are, as they always were, well told interpretations of the book series.  One must always keep in mind that every movie based on a book is just that, an interpretation.  One cannot expect a perfect transition.  Although, in my humble opinion, Dolores Umbridge is just as awful, even with the more limited violence and cruelties compared to the books.

If you and your family are fans of the Potter series, this is a great way to get all of them in the best condition and quality possible at a great price.  Don't miss the opportunity.",1356134400,,1710,4.45016077170418

Plus, it has 11 CDs not the 8 this US version has. Looks like the same case as well. I have tested a few of the DVDs soo far and they looks great. Ofcourse, the first couple of movies weren't filmed in the higher end HD film, so the quality isn't as good as new HD produced movies. Still they are good.

The box is more like a standard plastic case, not the special addition box that cost considerably more.

4567955,5,B00543R3WG,"I don't usually write product reviews, but I really feel the need to do this, since the existing reviews are conflicting:

I tip-toed around buying the 8-film Harry Potter Collection for a while.  A bunch of the reviews mentioned things like sub-par discs, discs with the wrong cover art (or no cover art), etc.  I finally decided to go for it; I could always return it if it wasn't up to my standards.

The set arrived and it's exactly what I was hoping for.  It has all eight movies, with all the correct art and the expected, single-case packaging.  In response to the images included at the top of the page from the customer who had the black disc for the 7th movie, etc - all I can assume is that there was an incorrect batch out there somewhere, and this has since been corrected.

If you're looking for tons of extras and super-fan material, then perhaps this isn't the set for you (although it seems the only other alternative is ridiculously expensive).  However, all I wanted was a set of all eight movies for a reasonable price, and this did that for me.  I highly recommend.",1355875200,,1086,4.472081218274112

There is another collector's box available that you can get with all the bells and whistles. This box set, however, had what I needed. All the HP movies in blu-ray without any special features, extraneous bonus materials etc. The box that the movies come in is sturdy and the movies are protected well enough in the box. At first the box looked small to contain all the eight movies, but upon opening, they were not only all there but neatly packed into their cover. Overall I would rate this a good product if you are looking for just the movies in blu-ray. The packaging was nice and I got what I needed.",1355529600,,774,4.344827586206897

I got this exact set, plus 3 bonus extra footage dvd's for $35.67 USD including the shipping cost.  I can't believe the U.S. Amazon site it charging so much for it.

Rowling from ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" to ""The Deathly Hallows"" BEFORE watching the 8 DVDs, I observed: (1) All 8 movies are highly entertaining and did a good job of following the basic plots of the books; (2) There were several times, especially in the later movies, that excessive special effects, violence, and drama were added to the screenplays taking time and valuable substance from the actual plots: and (3) I was disappointed at the end of ""Deathly Hallows"" part 2, that Harry simply throws the elder wand away over the side of the bridge.  It was so nicer in the book when he used the elder wand to properly mend his own wand (which he felt great renewed attachment to), then leave the elder wand in Dumbledore's office where It could do no further harm.",1349395200,2,809,4.541095890410959

However, what I really want are just the blu-ray movies (obviously extended cuts if possible, but don't think that will happen) and all the extra features and behind-the-scenes.  I don't really need all the extra bells-and-whistles (maps, cards, locket, DVD duplicate movies, etc), and I don't want to pay the high price for what I honestly consider just a bunch of junk (not being a collector, just an average fan).  Can't WB put out a box set of all the Ultimate Editions that would include only blu-ray discs and ALL the special features and commentary?  Priced in the $150-200 range?  I'm thinking/hoping that after all the hype of the Wizards Collection is over, a set like this will probably show up. That is what I am waiting for.

Amazon had the best price - about $69.00 - and shipped promptly, which was great since I was drooling over the thought of eating popcorn for at least two days while I gorged on Hogwarts and its class act. The set of DVDs is everything it promised and everything the true HP fan will ever need.

Every Harry Potter movie plays with no malfunctions.  Since I have a 5 and 8 year old who watch them over and over I no longer have to buy a one time play via the cable company or get the overused library movies.

Be prepared that there is not one single ""extra"".  Each DVD has only the movie.

Also be prepared for the cheaply made storage box.  It opens up like a old photo album with each hard plastic page holding two movies (front & back).  My 5 year old had it for less than a few minutes and broke it.  None of the movies were damaged but the ""pages"" didn't fit back into the box which was then difficult to close.  Maybe the Chinese could reengineer that storage box to once again hold the movies that came in it but my family is unable to.

The poor made storage box is actually the only reason I did not rate this product 5 stars.  I read the reviews and mostly knew only to expect the movies and they work so I am mostly satisfied.",1345507200,,1103,4.1415094339622645

Nowhere does it say that it is a Deluxe Edition, Extended Collection, or The Be All End All Definitive Box Set.

We have it on the DVD we bought years ago, but now have Blu Ray.  Then we found other extended scenes were missing.  As we only bought the first three movies on DVD years ago, we decided to get the Blu Ray set.  How disappointing this set is.  And I hear The Wizard's Collection is even worse.

We never watch the interviews, etc., so this collection was a perfect gift for the amount I paid for it. The attractive plastic case contains all eight movies in a convenient arrangement. I know some folks are waiting for the release later this year of a super special-edition, but the set I ordered is really all you need for owning, watching and enjoying the Potter collection in Blu-Ray.",1336608000,,680,4.870689655172414

The case that the movies come in is not made of the sturdiest materials, but that is hardly even worth mentioning. The movies themselves are perfect, and I love that they take up less space in our DVD stand. If you want a collectors item or a lot of extra features, you probably will want to purchase a different set, but if you just want to be able to enjoy the movies, I wouldn't pass this one up.",1336348800,,487,4.030927835051546

People who complain that this set doesn't have all the extras as the regular single movie DVDs are correct. But if they are truly super mega Harry Potter fans like they say, they would had bought every movie as it was released for purchase and shouldn't be buying this set anyway! All movies for less than $50 is a great price. I watched every movie multiple times since receiving this set and pick up something new I didn't notice before every time. Recommend to buy!!!",1335830400,,559,4.333333333333333
4568106,5,B00543R3WG,"These movies, while not as good as the books, are still great. The big bonus to this set is the size. All eight movies are packages in a case just slightly wider than two regular Blu-Ray cases. Fantastic for someone that doesn't have a huge amount of space to store movies, games, and cd's. There aren't as many special features as you often find in sets like this, but there are enough. There are very few movies and shows that I really have any interest in watching hours and hours of bonus material about, anyway.

They take scenes OUT of the movies, that played in the theatrical version, and put them in deleted scenes. You have no option to play with deleted scenes or the theatrical version. The cover art on the CDs is the exact same as the CDs from the individual released movies. They just threw it together to make some money for christmas. They are releasing a better collection set version later this year and I would save your money for that!",1334793600,,574,4.373831775700935

My only conflict with the set is that the fourth movie [Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire] was damaged and I was unable to watch it. It's terribly sad, considering that The Goblet of Fire is my favorite movie out of all eight, but it's 100% okay because my friend went to Walmart and purchased a new one for me [for only 2$!]. But for the price of this set, you can't honestly assume something like that is completely unlikely. Either way, purchase this set for all fans! No matter what age!",1334102400,,693,4.464566929133858

4568192,3,B00543R3WG,"We bought this for Christmas, so we didn't watch them in time to correct the problem with the order. Of course the movies are great, it was the DVD selection that's the problem. When customers buy DVDs, they automatically assume the DVDs are for home use, not the ones bought to rent to people. Now we're stuck with ten minutes of trailers for other movies coming out at the time each individual Harry Potter movie was released, along with a commericial for the Harry Potter game associated with that particular movie (or the still-hasn't-opened-website ""Pottermore."") ""Coming soon to a theatre near you"" or ""Coming soon on DVD"" fills a good ten minutes of our time, before the actual movie starts. Worse yet, there is no pause between the coming attractions (now all old movies) and the start of the movie, so we're stuck hoping we don't have to watch every single commericial, while waiting for the movie to start.

This is from Amazon, not from a third party, but apparently even Amazon was in such a rush to get this ""8-film collection"" out in time for Christmas, so they cheated on which movies to send. I can only assume when the ""Collection Set"" comes out, they will do a better job, but after this I recommend not to trust Amazon for their movies.

If you don't want the same problem, make sure you check your DVDs, when they first arrive. Heaven forbid, you give these knock offs as a present to someone a month or so later - you're stuck with them, because it's too late to return them. Always check Amazon movies for this problem immediately.",1329609600,,1553,4.602888086642599

4568195,2,B00543R3WG,"I am adding this review not of the movies but of the quality of the Blu-Ray disks in the hopes that I can save others some trouble. We got these just to have the movies, we love the books but are not die-hard movie fans. We are now on our second set, and disk 7 has serious (not Sirius) flaws. The video and audio are out of sync in a significant portion of the film. In both cases, it was the part where Ron, Hermione, and Harry have been captured by snatchers and turned over to the Malfoy/Black family. Loads of close ups with long speeches, the audio being out of sync here completely ruins these scenes. The first set we had, the sync problem extended from the Ron Returns portion of the film through the beach scene. With the same problem in the same spot on the same disk (though slightly less duration the second time) I can only conclude there is a bad batch of these. I very much hope that the manufacturer simply had a bad day in quality control. I would hate to think they are passing these off in the multi-disk set.

My kids love these, and I hate to return them. But even as cheap as they are (~ $10 per disk) it's just not worth it when one of the movies is rendered unwatchable.",1329523200,,1195,4.1731601731601735

4568209,5,B00543R3WG,"Just going to review the whole series, books and movies!  The writing is superb.  The movies are wonderfully done.  As an actual Witch, I would like to say that the type of Magick performed in these incredible books is not possible in actual life!  I would say that the closest thing to this type of Magick is Ceremonial Magick, which is not normally considered Pagan.  To quote Scotty from Star Trek, ""You cannot change the laws of physics!""  You can do a lot with Magick, but the Laws Of The Universe cannot be changed!  Only The Divine Being can do that.

These books are mythology.  The classic G vs. E tale INCREDIBLY WELL DONE!  Teaches great values and is a wonderful morality tale.  J.K. Rowling created a Magickal, Mystical, and profoundly real Inner World!

And you can't learn actual Magick from these Magickal books and movies.  The very real Magick is the brilliance of them and how very easily you will enter the world of Harry Potter, and how very hard you will weep when Sirius is murdered, when one of the Weasly twins is murdered.  You will cheer when Molly kills Bellatrix, when Neville kills Nagini, and when Professor McGonnagall gets Hogwarts to join in the fight!

We've been told time and time again that if we just want to purchase the BD and not worry about special features, that this was the definitive item. But WB dropped the friggin' ball on this one. Big Time.

No primary menus; it's a text block.

These BD were culled from spare BD single film Special Editions. Most will list the film's name and denote ""Disc One"", when it is the third or fourth movie in the series. This was not a version made for casual fans. This is nothing more than WB redressing their over stock and calling it a new BD boxed set. Way to go, WB.

4568217,3,B00543R3WG,"I received this set for Christmas, and I am going to sell it and get the ultimate editions that have been released. One, because I love Harry Potter and this set doesn't do justice to it, and second I am a collector, and an avid blu ray/dvd fan so It upsets me to see what is missing from this set. First, the case is fine, it holds the movies nicely and the blu rays look great, but once you get past the fifth disc you realise that you are just getting a poorly compiled set. For one the later movies are the disc ones of two disc sets, they didn't even try to print a new labels for this set, so each time you see this disc you realise you are only getting half of what is out there. There really are no extas with the last movies, because it's all included on the two disc sets. At least with the first five you get pretty decent extras, but there is so much out there that it seems a waste just to include the movie only version of the last movies.  For casual fans I would recommend it, but if you are like me and love the bonus features, there are better versions out there. I purchased the first movie in the ultimate edition form and am very pleased, the packaging/bonuses are great, and you get so many extras you will be overwhelmed (but in a good way) compared to these editions. I don't like this set because it seemed like they threw it together in order to make a few bucks for the end of the year, they didn't even think about the customers with this one. There were no bonus discs as with other box sets, to put all the extras in one place (to make up for the later movies having so little) But as far as the quality of the movie and how it looks/sounds on blu ray i'd give it 5 stars. and the movies themselves are great (as you know already if you are even reading this) However I think this was just a quick cash grab, but it's cheap enough for the casual fans. and it does free up some room in your collection (doesn't take up that much room compared with the other versions). So like I said for die-hards I'd say look elsewhere, for casual fans, this will probably be enough for you. And this comment has nothing to do with this set per se, but I feel the last two movies (Book 7) should have been combined into one longer movie rather than two seperate ones.  They say it was needed to cover the material, but even with two movies they still overlooked so much material that their point is rendedred moot. If kids are going to wait outside stores until after midnight to buy a book and then read it in one night, then they'd definitely sit through a three hour plus movie. It's all about the money though. I just think it detracts from an overall great franchise. But you can't go wrong with the movies, or the books...especially with the books. I'd recommend reading them first before seeing the movies, and just don't let the omissions bother you too much. The performances are great and the special effects are awesome. So enjoy.",1328486400,,2955,4.228318584070797

Blu-rays are clearer and sound better than regular DVDs, look great on my 58"" Panasonic Plasma, with no graininess, blurred edges, and action scenes are smooth.",1328227200,,341,4.516129032258065
4568224,5,B00543R3WG,The complete Harry Potter collection of DVDs is a phenomenal addition to my DVD collection. Loved that they came in a singular case and that each was available as part of the set.,1327968000,,179,4.454545454545454
4568225,5,B00543R3WG,"Our son gave us a beautiful and nice HDTV for Christmas.  Huge surprise!!! especially since we all agreed to not have a gift exchange for the adults in our family this year.
  We did not see the ending of the Harry Potter series as yet and we wanted to begin our new adventure into Blu ray with movies that we were sure would be really good and that would demonstrate the effects of having Blu ray technology.  We already have seen several of the Harry Potter movies at the movie theater, and have the first six Harry Potter movies at home on regular DVD.
  Having watched them several times, and expecting to purchase the remaining ones anyway...for about $40-$50, it seemed appropriate to choose the Blu ray version and get the whole series at once.  To continue with the technology of this 21st century, we bought a nice Panasonic Blu ray player and will get some Logitech speakers with a sub-woofer in the next few weeks to enhance the sound. We are really looking forward to it!
  The price of the Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection (Blu ray) was good and a deciding factor to go this route. The cost of getting the last 2 movies would have been approximately $50 anyway, so spending a little more to purchase this set was a good choice for us.
  The set contains only the movies (without the extra discs that we don't really use at all anyway).  The container is nice and has clear blue plastic book-like pages which are practical for holding the discs securely and all in one place. The jacket is nice for protecting the ""book"". The quality of the movies speak for themselves, and we are very happy with our purchase of this Blu ray collection. Just another note....it arrived in a short time and in perfect condition.  Very happy with every one of our Amazon experiences.  Signed: Dolores Jones",1327968000,,1812,4.552469135802469
4568226,5,B00543R3WG,My boyfriend and I love this series and were really excited to own them all on blu-ray. I know this pack doesn't have special features but we really don't ever watch those anyway so this was perfect for us.,1327881600,,206,4.3076923076923075

4568232,5,B00543R3WG,"It goes without saying that the Harry Potter series of movies had all the elements
for great entertainment. The kids were good actors when this started and watching them mature into their talent is a treat we usually don't get except in television series.
I love the films. I couldn't believe what a steal this was to purchase all the movies at such a price. I love being able to watch anytime I want to dive back into Harry Potter's universe.

I understand the Blue Ray version would have interviews, however I didn't see paying
for that when interviews are already available and will be again whenever the actors appear on television.",1327795200,,636,4.678571428571429

I was shocked and amazed at how little those kids were in the first movies and how the story just kept getting better and better.  It was wonderful and so much fun not to wait years inbetween episodes.  She, of course, still watching clips every night of ""her faves"".  Really great set!  LOL",1327622400,,396,4.52112676056338

4568237,5,B00543R3WG,"Sure most of you have never heard of this little move series before, but do not be put off by it's ability to fly under the radar. It was actually pretty darn cool. Considering that it was based on a series of books(?)...do people still read? it was surprisingly entertaining. Honestly, if you don't know about Harry Potter and need to read a review about it then you should probably try and get out of the giant cave you've been hiding in since Y2K. Seriously, you're still reading this? Go. Go away. Beat it. Go watch this and you can then write a review for others to get bummed on...or like. Whatever.",1327536000,,605,4.410714285714286

They are not that good, the quality is really bad. Some are really blurry, they look really bad that its like if they were cheaply copied or illegally reproduced. Now I understand why the cost is so low. I recomend that you don't buy this. I am not even  a fan and the quality made me not even want to see it...DO NOT BUY.",1327449600,37,451,4.067415730337078
4568240,3,B00543R3WG,"I already owned the DVD's for most of the movies and wanted a little better picture quality. I think they delivered on this with improvements throughout the series although the later films are much better than the first two. My problem is the sound in disc 7, Deathly Hallows pt. 1, keeps going out of sync with the picture. I can pause rewind forward and then play to get it back on track but it happens repeatedly making the experience very poor.",1327363200,,448,4.475609756097561

I didn't think she cared about watching extras since she never does any other time we watch the movies but oh well, she was excited Christmas morning and hasn't stopped watching them over and over and over again since then.

4568283,4,B00543R3WG,"I've been debating about this one for a while and ordered when the price finally dropped to what I wanted to pay.  I really only wanted the movies and having a couple of extras like deleted scenes suits me just fine.  Got the package a few days later and it was in a bubble-wrapped envelope vs. the amazon box I expected.  Thought... no biggie, as long as it's what I ordered. Opened it up and the holders were broken in places. You could hear them scraping up against the discs and the slightest pressure mad the box feel like it was going to crumble any second.

I've never had to retunr anything to amazon, so I dreaded the ordeal, but this just wasn't what I paid for.  So I went online and found out I coudln't get it replaced because it was supplied by someone else apparently.  I had to get a refund, wait for that to be processsed, then reorder the set.  By then the price had gone up by like 25%.  However, Amazon's Support Team rocks and they gave me the same price as I ordered it before without a fuss and fixed everything within minutes of me placing the order.

Everything was resolved quickly and I received the new set the next day and this one was delivered in the amazon box. Open it up and this is where it got strange... This box set was completely different than the first one I received.  The first one had four holders, each holding 2 discs, in a larger sleeve and all were cheaply made, thus the breakage during delivery I'm assuming.  The new one looks like the pictures on amazon.com.  It's a slim box with one holder that slides out and opens up like a book.  You turn the pages to see all the dics.  Much better quality than the first one and very happy with the purchase now that it's all fixed.

Lesson in all this... make sure when you purchase it says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"".  This changes from day to day it seems.",1326412800,,1856,4.26

4568288,4,B00543R3WG,"The Harry Potter Collection gives us all 8 films that were produced from 2001 to 2011,giving celluloid life to JK Rowlings impressive written sagas. Impressive sometimes doesn`t even begin to describe the high quality of craftsmanship that went into each and every film. From the direction,to the editing to the plot and so on and so on,everything about these films is top notch all the way. The S/FX just got better and better as the series(and technology)progressed. We saw all the main actors grow up before our very eyes without losing touch of their core characters. To round it out,as if it needs saying,is Rowlings extremely imaginative settings and characters. Her entire take on this world of wizardry and her ability to put her ideas to paper,and it to go onto film,and ALL capture and create literally millions of fans from every part of the globe,is astounding or,as Harry himself would say,brilliant.
I won`t go into each film,as the plots are quite well known by now,but I will say I found not one clunker in the group. They are all long films,coming in around 120 minutes or much more,but I never found myself looking at my watch or getting bored:a definite sign someone knew what they were doing.
Technically speaking the films are in their original w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and are clear and crisp. All DVD`s come in layered round plastic holders. All seem to sit and fit quite snugly.
I had to take one star off this impressive series of films for one reason. Warners decided to re-package the original single disc releases. That is if you have already bought them singly or in the 1-5 or 1-6 sets,you will already have what this one puts out,right down to the disc cover artwork,or lack thereof,and the picture/film hesitations that occur most noticeably in the first five that happen in or around the 75 minute mark of each film. Disappointing. They could have at least made a re-run of the series with new disc artwork and gotten rid of those pesky hesitations. But no,Warners,as is like most companies,had dollar signs in their eyes and rushed this set out to cash in on the Potter craze and keep it alive until their next release,which will be.....who knows when or in what fashion. There are very few extras in any of these discs save for the odd commentary or deleted scenes. But it is these extra scenes which makes me think somewhere down the line Warners will re-issue these films not only with several extra discs for each movies,but also in extended versions,similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy,which would only enhance them. And the extended versions of the LOTR films are magnificent.
Me,I am not that rabid a Potter fan that I want to wait for newer versions down the line,so I decided to get my Potter fix now and straight up,with little or no extras. If you are a big Potter fan,and you are among the countless legions of them,you might want to wait for those inevitable newer and remastered versions down the pike...or get these now and get those later! It is your choice but whatever you decide,you know you will be getting eight wondrous and beautiful films that bring Rowlings wondrous works to beautiful filmic life. Highly recommended.",1326326400,,3174,4.7518115942028984

The packaging is horrendous. 8 dvds in one case. Jammed in there. Ideally each movie would have its own case, but 2 movies a case would have also been acceptable. 8 dvds in one case is just ridiculous, as box sets are often made for collectors, this is a big deal. You want a good box set, you can get the first 5 movies in a big collectors case(looks like a little suitcase, comes with lots of other cool little trinkets and whatnot), for only 20 dollars on amazon right now.

4568294,1,B00543R3WG,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my fiancee expecting to love it despite previous reviews - because we don't really care about the pretty box set or bonus features or anything like that - We've had one out of eight discs play from start to finish without problems. This might be a rare issue but these discs cause my - fairly new - Samsung bluray player to go into ""grind"" mode - it's constantly trying to find where to even start reading the disc on 7 of 8. It stutters and skips partway through those seven movies as well. This doesn't happen with any other bluray we have - just the 7 of 8 discs in this box that are obviously burned incorrectly.

I've asked for a replacement set from Amazon for a Christmas gift that was supposed to work right the first time through- will update this review when possible. For now, I couldn't possibly give this set a lower rating.

UPDATE:

The replacements are just as poor. Every disc skips, stutters and doesn't play as expected. I will return both of these and steal the content - these jerks really expect that more of us will accept an order for media we cannot legally copy (bluray does not allow for backing up content legally)... that enough of us will just eat the difference... it's no wonder that people won't pay for digital content on hard copy anymore - i'd rather download all eight movies illegally and risk infecting my computer with viruses than pay someone to provide me with two seperate sets of discs that DONT EVEN WORK in a brand new bluray player. Bonus - I have to pay the return postage!

UPDATE 2 -
Don't even bother - this is an $80 piece of polished garbage. I would rather spend five years in federal prison (because that is the only screen that actually loads) than pay another $80 for hard copies that WILL NOT PLAY. Chalk me up as another potential paying customer who chooses to steal the content rather than pay for a product that is NOT worth the money you have to pay for the privilege of finding out that the disc makers are doing it wrong.",1326240000,55,2025,4.392
4568295,1,B00543R3WG,"This is a great price for a nice, bare bones collection of movies, which is perfectly fine by me. What is not fine by me is the fact that some of these movies were wide screen and some were full screen. A few had auto-play while others had previews. I don't mind if they're simply reprints of the original releases, but they could have at least been consistent with the products they reprinted. I am the kind of person who has to have wide screen, and wants things within a set to have the same basic functions (especially when advertised as such); please bear this in mind as you take in this information.

Also, the set that I received had five damaged discs; no physical damage or dust on the discs themselves, but they would not play past ten minutes into the movie, and some could not access secondary menus. This grievance is specific to the set I received, but buyer beware.

I will be returning this item and waiting for the next (likely more expensive, sadly) release of a Harry Potter boxed set.",1326153600,101,1005,4.456521739130435

The movies look amazing on my samsung lcd/blue ray player, and the audio is top rate as well. Each film is the theatrical release and has the usual behind the scenes reel, as well as deleted scenes selections.  Since most of the movies are in excess of 2.5 hours anyway, I don't feel cheated not having the edited scenes incorporated into the films, a la the directors cuts of the Lord of the Rings series. My only issue involves the packaging. Some of the discs come loose quite easily, risking damage with rough handling. Otherwise, very pleased with this package.",1326153600,,673,4.743589743589744

I said ""Oh well"" and popped in the first DVD, first of the series, not first in the case. I noticed quite quickly that the picture was a bit grainy and the audio seemed very low (even with surround sound). I them started to notice that the movie was ""jumpy"", seemed like it was trying to pause for a nanosecond. I thought if it was just one movie I would deal with it... 4 movies in and I was having the exact same issues with all of them. I then realized that the disks seemed mismatched; some had special features OR previews, others did not. During The Order of the Phoenix the chapters would repeat themselves numerous times and at odd moments. I gave up and took it out to start the next one! It is my opinion (having viewed numerous of them) that these disks are bootlegged or reproduced. I am so disappointed that I have to return them and wait for the refund to buy a DVD boxed set that works!

  This collection has been a hit at our house. My family first watched them all in order. Now, we have been watching them in no specific order. We don't ever seem to ""burn out"" on watching Harry Potter. I liked watching Harry grow from a naive boy to a powerful wizard. I first saw these movies years apart at the theater. So, it was great to review them all again. This time I could put the whole Harry Potter puzzle together, for a better understanding. Now, my favorite movie is Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows part II. Some of the supporting characters get their shining moments and you find yourself cheering them on.
 We have the DVD set and have not had any problems with the quality of these movies after numerous plays. My family doesn't mind that this set didn't come with alot of frills or is not commemerative. The packaging has a nice cover and a brief synopsis of each disc on back. They come in a plastic holder that houses all eight discs. I would highly recommend this set to all Harry Potter fans.",1325289600,,1258,4.4847161572052405

4568357,5,B00543R3WG,"Love the movies of course, but I'm glad I waited to buy it as a set. Much cheaper and all 8 discs fit in a box that would normally only hold 2. Costs nearly twice as much at Target, too. No bonus materials or booklets but all I really wanted were the films and for the price this is perfect!",1325203200,,291,3.8666666666666667

Good picture, great audio,  a few extras that are available on blu-ray only....as usual, I shopped around and Amazon beat everyone's price that I could find! Completely satisfied! Come in an all inclusive case that is not very bulky...as wide as two standard cases, but has all 8 blu-rays!
Art work is just neat-o!",1325203200,,409,4.680555555555555

4568363,4,B00543R3WG,"This is a good collection of all the movies for a great price, although I wouldn't order it from Amazon in this case.  It is actually cheaper from the warner brothers website.  I payed about $45 for the set.  It doesn't have any of the ""extra"" stuff like special features and behind the scenes, but I don't like watching much of that anyways.  Over all, it is a very nice set.",1325116800,,376,4.253521126760563
4568364,5,B00543R3WG,"There are one or two of these films that might have maybe been a little bit more of a 4 star rating in my book, but the whole set itself simply deserves a full 5 star rating!  These movies are enjoyable and a good bet for any fantasy lover out there!  I have never honestly read the books before, so I cannot give a comparison between them and the movies, but no doubt there is more within the books...even Peter Jackson couldn't bring everything over into the Lord of the Rings movies, as epic as they were, but that in no way means that they weren't good movies.  Lord of the Rings was totally amazing!  These movies as well, though not quite as epic as Lord of the Rings, are pretty awesome themselves...and I've been told that the book to movie comparison between these isn't all too bad...not like some I can think of, such as Percy Jackson.  That movie in and of itself was fairly enjoyable, but I happen to have read the books, and Fox totally screwed up that movie!  Anyway, not to get too far off track...Harry Potter, as so many people know, are fun, enjoyable movies and I highly recommend that anyone who enjoys movies checks them out...especially if you're a fantasy lover.  If you're really more of a reader...then read the books!  :-)",1325116800,,1249,4.447368421052632

I wasn't looking for a collectors item, just wanted all the movies together and that is what I got. So if you are looking for a collectors item do not order but if you are just looking for the movies it is a must buy.",1325116800,,392,4.038461538461538

But if you have none, or even one, or two, or three, I still think this is worth it. It's the easiest way to collect the entire series in a neat package, and it's a decent price. No complaints.",1325030400,,293,3.9
4568377,5,B00543R3WG,"This set was perfect for me, because I wanted each movie that wouldn't take up too much space in my DVD shelf.

4568384,5,B00543R3WG,"We have enjoyed having all of the Harry Potter series. We were just saying that it was nice to not have to not wait for the next part of the story.  We have been watching one per night, and that works. Since there is not much on TV that we like it is nice to have a series of movies that we have paid big bucks to see. We like all of the extras, such as interviews and deleted scenes that are included.  It is also fun to see the actors who start out quite young and get older as the story progresses. There seems to be more than I remember.  At any rate this is a good series to have.",1325030400,,585,3.8181818181818183
4568385,5,B00543R3WG,I loved Harry Potter movies and having all of them together to watch whenever I want is wonderful.  My favorite movies are the two because of the ghosts.

The complete film set has 8 DVDs in its individual DVD digi-tray but not in individual jewel cases which makes it compact, slim, and easy to store. This complete collection even has ""The Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" which I have not seen yet. Great product, great price, and complete set.

I was a little concerned that the box was too thin, but inside all of the discs are held in their own nice little plastic sleeves that you can flip through--very convenient and it saved a lot of space compared to each disc in its own individual box(less likely to lose one that way too).  I bought this as a gift for my little sister and she absolutely loves it. She has watched all of the movies in a two day span.  We already had one of the movies but this was a much more cost effective way to get the rest of them.  Great product and got a great deal!!",1324944000,,622,4.032520325203252

While the quality is excellent, and you do receive some special features with this collection, the only missing component would be an upgrade in packaging for the complete collection. Each disc comes separately packaged, and then all of the discs are gathered into one large cardboard (?) sleeve. While that has nothing to do with the quality of the item, it does matter to those of us with a concern for aesthetics, and the appeal that can be brought when purchasing an entire collection instead of purchasing each film separately.

The films are an excellent buy, and definitely worth the purchase.",1324944000,,808,4.805755395683454

When it came, I was doubly delighted as the 8-disc set was in a compact box about the width of 3 regular DVD boxes, instead of an obnoxious larger box that takes up way too much room on my DVD shelf.  Yes, there are fancier boxed sets out there, but I just wanted it for the movies, not for a collection, so this was perfect.

Sure it doesn't have a fancy box and an included cape and wand but do I really need that stuff if they were to offer it in a box set.

Rumor has it they are going to lock the series away and bring it back out in like 10 years or so similar to what Disney does.

However, when I got it, they do not have individual covers, and there is a broken plastic piece.  Providing the other piece doesnt break, it will be ok.  But for the regular price of like $80...I'd rather buy them all separately , which you can do for less than $50. I purposely didn't buy any of them over the years because I knew there would be a box set, but I didn't know it would be so bare bones.",1324857600,,536,3.9813084112149535

4568434,4,B00543R3WG,"The transfers themselves onto BluRay for the first five films looks absolutely gorgeous. Smooth, crisp, vivid, delicious 5.1 audio. My only two complaints are that it features very little bonus material, and the packaging and BluRay art are just taken from previous BluRay releases, and feature 'Disc 1' written on them. And the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is literally just black with the name written on it, which looks very cheap and out of place among the others.

4568435,5,B00543R3WG,"Ths review is for the Blu Ray version of the complete 8 disc set.
I will be brief and to the point.

Extended Scenes - Yes. (Compared to the standard DVD collector's 1-5 set)

Bonus Material - Yes. Each disc has bonus material.
In fact, all the bonus material is labeled right on the back cover of the set box.
Other reviews stated there were none or just the last 2 discs has some.
But the truth is, all of the discs have bonus material.
I think some reviewers tried to pull a ""stupify!"" on us.

If the rumours are true that there will be no more sets released after the New Year
then you had better hurry and get this set now.
When compared to the standard DVD Years 1-5 collector set I am very happy
with the quality upgrade the Blu Ray discs offer along with extended scenes I have never seen before.

So get on your Nimbus 2000 and grab a copy of this set before its gone forever.

4568445,5,B00543R3WG,"There are a lot of people that have rated this as a one star box set for its lack of special features and special packaging, rightfully so. However, $98 is a bit of a dream price to pay for 8 DVD's in a special package.

For the money, this is an excellent set, with great quality picture (DVD at least) that can be watched over and over and over. My girlfriend is an avid Harry Potter fan and will undoubtedly watch all the discs until they are all too scratched to read. Personally, that's what I think this set is for. If you're looking for a collector's item then hold out, but if you just want to watch the movies, then don't pass this up",1324512000,,643,4.144
4568446,2,B00543R3WG,"I don't need to talk about the movies. But the packaging was disappointing, to say the least.

They didn't even print new labels for the disks! It's like ""Harry Potter and the (whatever), Disk 1"". What do you mean, Disk 1? It's only 1 disk per movie!!

So this obviously means they just got all the individual movies that didn't sell, threw the ""Extras"" disk away and put them into this 8-disk package.

I bought this because I still have the ""years 1-5"" DVD box, so I just replaced the DVDs with the blu-rays.

But this is not the box to buy if you want a ""Complete Film Collection"", despite of what the product name and description says...

The casing is very fragile, be careful letting kids handle it.

I have to complain about the way it was shipped to me. The box was opened and I feared the set was not there. It also was not protected with anything, no bubble wrap, paper, nothing! It was moving around in the box. The set itself was sealed and didn't look like anyone had tried to open it. When I opened it, it was just fine.

While the other movies have a picture of Harry/Ron/Hermione, 7 part 1 is totally black and says ""harry potter movie"". I have not seen the actual disc for 7 part 1 and it is definitely possible that it never had a cover art. I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price, but I got this one on sale for $80.

After all, I have the movies on DVD, and my Blu-Ray player does a great job of upscaling, so the Blu-Ray version is not strictly necessary for me.  That said, the Blu-Ray is just a better all-around experience given the choice.  The price seems alright for this set, but I did better, thus the 4-star rating and not 5.  Instead of ordering this box set, I went to the UK Amazon website and bought it there (amazon.co.uk) for about half the price.  An excellent option, considering I got all 8 movies and additional special feature content for around $45 (and region-free discs).",1323820800,2,689,4.614754098360656

No trailers or adds on the Blu-ray when loading, no BD-Live loading tralers for you, no having to hit menu or skip or fast forward, it just plays the movie.

Also when stopping, at least with our Samsung player, it remembers where it left off and starts playing (just like DVDs), again, no hassles, not setting bookmarks, etc., it remembers where it left off and starts playing.

We also have a 5.1 surround system and the sound quality and mixing is excellent.

After doing research I decided to ordered my 8 Film Blu-Ray from the UK and paid $48 (versus $79.99 in USA). I received 8 Blu-Ray discs plus 3 Blu-Ray extra content discs for the last three movies. The packaging was solid with the 8 movies + 3 extra content discs divided into 4 Blue Plastic cases. The box cover shows 3 images of Harry at different ages. I had to wait a little longer and only received my package on 12/12/11 but based on value and extra content it was well worth the wait.

I have not watched the movies yet so will update my review after I've done that.

UPDATE 4/24/12
I have watched most of the movies in the set as well as the extras. Very pleased with the quality. Some parts of the film that looked really dark, like the beginning of the first Harry Potter movie, look so much clearer and crisper on Blu-Ray.

Watching this on a 54"" plasma in a dark room with a great sound system makes you believe you're at the movie theater, without all the hassle.

There has been some comments on here about these not being the extended editions.....what tripe.  They come with bonus scenes, and I am NOT going to wait another year for the extended ones to come out.

4568532,5,B00543R3WG,"This box set has come in for serious criticism regarding its limits.  Indeed, there can be no doubt that this set doesn't have extended cuts and director's cuts.  However, what it does have is completely satisfying, i.e. high definition versions of the theatrical releases of the films, wonderfully transferred; deleted scenes from each film; documentaries, interviews, commentaries, and the usual fluff that comes with these things; and some video game materials.  Frankly, I do not think they will release the newer versions (extended cuts and director's cuts) as a box sets until they have released all of them individually - they will do it in a way that maximizes sales, based on timing.  That means that these are the only versions we will have for some time as they will prolong the cycle as long as possible.

This will sound repetitive, but these are absolutely great films and have been a part of my family experience for the last 11 years.  We watch them together periodically and always made the trek to the cinema to see new releases.  They spurred my children to read their first long books.  Plus, each film is consistently excellent in its own way, quite an accomplishment for a series of 8 films.

While we love the films, I doubt that we will want more than these as we are not the kind of fans that Trekkies are.  Thus, for those like us, I warmly recommend this set.  Interestingly, I got the version in British blu-ray for about $50. Given the price of the blu-rays of the final 2 films, that made it worthwhile for us to pay a little more for the entire set - without dvd and other media versions that we would scarcely want anyway.",1323129600,4,1654,4.63013698630137

Since I never bought any of the individual movies on DVD, this was the most economical way to own all 8 parts.  I liked the way the disks were packaged in one case.  The minimalist packaging makes for easy access to the disks & doesn't take up any more space then 2 DVD cases.  All 8 disks played great.  There were no playback issues.  Parts 7 & 8 did contain deleted scenes.  Otherwise each disk is one movie & some theater trailers.  After seeing all the low ratings I thought there were quality issues, but this is not the case.  The bad reviews seem to focus on the lack of special features & the UK having a better Blu-ray box set.  It just seems some people won't be happy no matter what box set WB puts out.  Overall, if you are looking for all 8 Harry Potter films, this is a great deal!  This set was about $40 dollars when I purchased it.  The price has gone up in the last week.

Sure it doesn't have all of the special features the edition coming out next year will have, but it is great if you just want all of the movies in one high quality package this is perfect for you.",1322870400,,346,3.887323943661972
4568540,4,B00543R3WG,"I got the blu ray set, 8 movies for $80 on Amazon. My ONLY complaint is that the disk art is not cohesive. They will likely publish a box set and redesign all the dvd labels to match more, but this one just has whatever the original art work was for each disk. Really NOT a big deal unless you're into owning awesome looking box sets. But for $10 a disk, I really don't mind! :)",1322784000,,378,3.986842105263158

4568542,4,B00543R3WG,"The reviews warning against this product due to a lack of special features are completely misguided. The title of this release is ""The 8 Film Collection""; it is not called ""Collector's Edition"" or ""Deluxe Edition"" or ""The Bonus Features Galore Collection"". This is a nice little set for casual fans who simply want all 8 films on blu-ray. And considering this set is (currently) less than $80, how can you complain?

Yes, if you're a huge fan of the franchise and want extended cuts and bonus features, save your time and money and wait for a possible future release. But I find it silly that so many reviewers are ""warning"" others not to buy this release because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles.

-- You can get the DVDs before WB stops shipping them at the end of 2012.
-- You get all 8 movies in one box (they aren't in individual boxes like many sets).

Cons:
-- The only ""optional material"" is the trailer.  My DVD player always played the trailer before the movie.
-- Disk labels aren't all coordinated.  Some had pictures, some were black.
-- Compression problems in a couple of places (the picture lost detail/had moire/frame was short).",1322697600,,453,4.6375

What does bother me is the simple fact that Warner Brothers rushed this out too soon.  The images on the discs are pulled right from the old ones (The Half Blood Prince has disc 1 on it, when there is only one disc).  The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a plain black disc with no image.  It took me forever to get the Deathly Hallows Part 1 to play because it kept bringing me back to my blu ray player's home screen.  I will be calling Amazon customer service and probably returning this.",1322524800,2,635,4.25

First of all, let me say I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was looking forward to a complete box set of the extended edition blurays. This is not that collection.

To be fair, the movies themselves all warrant 5-stars. This package is nice for fans who just want the regular movies and don't care about all the extras.  But most diehard fans want more than that... the additional scenes, the deleted material. Give us Hogwarts the way it was meant to be!!

I am altering my rating to three-stars because I see the need for this collection, but would still like an extended version.  To me, this product is still incomplete and I cannot recommend it for true fans.

Please put the magic back into Harry Potter... =(",1322524800,,1075,5.852564102564102
4568548,5,B00543R3WG,"If you are looking for a SIMPLE Harry Potter Box Set, with all the movies then this is for you! It is cheap and has everything you need in a small box, easy to bring from place to place (for those Harry Potter marathon parties).

This is not a box set filled with special features and all those bells and whistles. If you are looking for that, I recommend you look elsewhere. This is exactly what I myself wanted, as I can never justify spending tons of money for all those special features that I won't even watch, however there are many who like that sort of thing. Make sure which kind of fan you are buying for if you plan on this being a gift to someone.",1322524800,14,659,4.1484375
4568549,4,B00543R3WG,"Here's the down low. December 29th All the Harry Potters are going into the Warner vault (no vault is not a Disney coined term) That means for about 2-5+ years they will print no more new Harry Potter DVDs. For probably about a year or so the warehouses will continue to ship what they have to stores like, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and stores like Movie Trading Company. Gradually the dwindling of supplies will cause the bigger stores to stop ordering them and only stores like mine will carry them until the warehouse runs out and then we run out and for once the Harry Potter movies become rare. Prices will skyrocket because it's a popular series.

Now, 5+ years later they release an awesome SUPER special addition that will cost a billion dollars and have all the bells and whistles.

If you're looking for all the movies by themselves to tide you over until the Super special edition, this is it. It's small and compact and comes with language options (something I didn't expect). So if you're a fan, go ahead and by it and wait for the awesome. Of course they won't release the special editions right away, that's bad business....",1322524800,8,1139,4.605911330049261
4568550,5,B00543R3WG,"I have not read the Harry Potter books, & am glad I didn't, as I loved the movies. 1 & 2 was charming. 3 through 8 were just terrific! Loved the last movie.

Some day, when I have time, I'll read the books, as I'm sure their great & much more comprehensive. But, in most cases, the book is better than the movie, if only because the book came out first, & people nitpick over what was left out of the movie, or changed in the movie. I've been guilty of this myself.

The Harry Potter series of movies are nothing short of spectacular! Eight great films is quite an achievement! An achievement that never has been done before with so many films with a continuing story.

I expect, ten, twenty years from now, I'll still get great enjoyment out of them, for if there is a modern day equivalent to ""the Wizard of Oz,"" it's ""Harry Potter.""

All the Blu rays are perfection. Get them now, or later, as this film series is immortal, where they belong!",1322438400,,945,4.292134831460674
4568551,3,B00543R3WG,"While the packaging for this affordable collection on blu-ray of Harry Potter films is sound enough, the discs themselves are somewhat strange. First, the sound is very low. I have to turn my television's volume to 100 to get it loud enough. Watching regular TV I have it set to 28. This is the case with all the discs. I don't have a 5.1 sound system, but it's still strange that the sound was mixed so low. Secondly, the movies start immediately upon inserting the disk. It gives no title menu to decide when you want to play it and no easy way to find chapters. At least there are no irritating previews and ads that are so standard now. Lastly, I am only through the first few movies but the extra features are intriguing but not in letterbox format. I assume they were filmed in standard size originally and they haven't adapted them; it's bothersome to have to switch the screen size on the TV depending on the feature. All these things are livable and the price is certainly right when on sale (though recently it seems like everyone had blu-ray Harry Potter for $10 a movie). It's been interesting to go back and watch all the movies in rapid succession and to see the improvement with every film and to watch the characters and the actors grow up right before our eyes. I recommend the collection for the price if on sale ($80), but I wonder if they're going to come out with a set in the future that'll have remastered sound, etc.",1322438400,,1440,4.437735849056604

I mean some left out details and such, but when you have a collective group of people who are trying to make the best movie possible, you can overlook those missing details. The cast has improved with each film and the effects have become spectacular. Watching these books come to life has been an honor and a privilege. I have seen many movies that have come from books, but I have never seen them portrayed as real and as true to the book as these movies. With the exception of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. These films are fantastic and I would recommend them to anyone. Regardless if you've read the books, you will enjoy these movies and hopefully come to love them as I do.",1322352000,4,730,4.297101449275362

Some reviews I read slammed this set version (BluRay,RegionOne locked, 8 disks) for being light on included bonus and extras material. They even provided info that an ""Ultimate"" boxset is due out. I am in agreement with them. Distributors do ""hold out"" on providing complete box sets with ALL the extras included to make extra money. Others made a choice for going thru Amazon UK to get 11 disks (BluRay/DVD,8 BR RegionUnlocked, 3 DVDs RegionTwo locked). I had heard of distributors bundling different packages and releasing at different times but 3 hours later my n00bie box set head is spinning. I made the choice to buy Amazon UK for pre-order. Never pre-ordered before, never bought overseas. I paid around 45$ US inc ship for three extra RegionTwo locked DVDs and 8 BluRay disks. Maybe some don't want to go to the bother to view a RegionTwo disk in the states but I'm game for learning. IMHO, read up on box set versions and what you're actually buying as a consumer. 5 star series, 3 stars for the distributors marketing, extras are important to me so I rated accordingly.",1322265600,4,1178,4.695652173913044

4568557,5,B00543R3WG,"I waited for this collection without buying any of the individual movies. It's a very nice compact set, so if you love the movies and don't own any of the individual ones, this is the set for you! It is wider than a normal DVD or BluRay case, and ends up looking like a TV series single season set. It is also set up very nice, with each disc on its own ""page"" within the box (see photos). I'm not sure why, but all of the discs except Deathly Hallows Part 1 have a cover image while Deathly Hallows Part 1 is black. That is my only complaint about the set. BluRay is the way to go since it looks amazing on any size TV!

Like some other reviewers have pointed out, this is essentially the individual movies packaged into a condensed set. If you're looking for extended versions of each of the movies, it looks like you'll have to wait nearly a year for that set to come out.",1322179200,48,875,4.147058823529412

I purchased them as a gift for family members.  Half of the discs don't work, others skip throughout the movie.  I've tried countless other blu ray discs and other players.  I am confident that it is the discs.

Additionally, the discs don't have menus, scene selection, etc.  Which makes me seriously question the quality from which they came.

She's not interested in commentaries and other extra stuff. She just likes to watch the movies, so this is perfect for her. The Amazon price was $48 when I ordered mine last week (and it qualified for free shipping, which only takes a day or two longer in my experience). That works out to $6 per movie, a pretty good price in my opinion. And logging in today to write this review, I see the price has dropped to $39.99. That works out to $5 per movie, an even better deal.

If you're not interested in all the extra stuff (that people will pay a lot more money for when the super duper amazing deluxe set is released in the future) and just like to watch the movies, this collection is a good option. It's convenient to have all the movies in one compact set at a great price.

4568567,4,B00543R3WG,"I'm not a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. Ms Rowling is a competent, sometimes inspired, story teller, but these books are largely devoid of any ""literary"" quality that might appeal to adults. This is understandable; one doesn't expect the quality of Evelyn Waugh or Cormac McCarthy from novels aimed at tweens and young adults. *

The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, are too light in tone (both dramatically and photographically), and (even in Harry's confrontation with Tom Riddle and the basilisk) fail to properly foreshadow the darkness that will descend. The criticism that they're ""too much like the books"" is valid.

But starting with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", the films are better than the books. They show us what Ms Rowling could not (or chose not to) convey in words -- Harry & friends live an a world that doesn't have a guaranteed happily-ever-after ending. Indeed, the generally ""adult"" quality of the last six films is a compliment to the producers' good judgement. (Steve Kloves' economical and focused scripts also deserve praise.)

The latter films get /so/ dark -- literally -- that a display with good shadow detail is recommended for maximum enjoyment. I don't know how much grain reduction was used (I saw no grain, at any time), but there's plenty of detail, and no visible edge sharpening.

* An ex-boss of mine, an ex-English teacher, recommended them as being pretty good. I was disappointed that they were little more than entertaining.",1321920000,3,1478,4.995934959349594

I have only watched Disc 5 so far, but there is no way of knowing which of the two ""English"" tracks I was on since there is no menu to select the audio track, and when I use my audio button the pop up text just says ""English"".  It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to play the movie with out the ""special features"" at the same time.

It still may be a good deal compared to the future releases, but I have just come accustomed to certain features on a blu-ray disc, and the way these disks are set up it feel more like a pirated copy than an original.",1321833600,8,735,3.9659863945578233

You get all 8 movies on Blu, same as this set, plus three extras discs that this set does *not* have, and it costs you about $30 less even AFTER shipping. You'll have to wait a few extra days to get it in your hands because they have to ship it overseas, but I think most people would probably rather wait than spend than the money.

Okay, the UK box isn't quite as spiffy-looking (or maybe it's better, if you're into Daniel Radcliffe). Is a better box worth a $30 price premium? The UK 1-8 box set is undisputably a better version, and it costs significantly less. Warners, why are you trying to sell us this? Anybody with a half a brain sees right through you.

This is STILL applicable advice, but in light of some of the comments I think I should clarify that I am ONLY talking about the Blu-rays, not the DVD set.

However, you do get what you pay for, and given the cheap per unit rate that I paid for (which is around $10 per movie), I am pleased with the purchase.

It is disappointing to learn that this is just a repackaging of the existing Blu-ray discs that are currently in other sets, as well as the lack of proper representation of the disc art as photographed by the product image in this listing.  But these are just minor complaints.

I like that this box set contains all 8 movies in one case the size of two normal cases. It is not 8 individual slim cases. This works well for me because I dislike the slim cases but am running out of room on my bookshelf.
Again if you do not care about all the special feature discs and just want to watch the Movies you cant go wrong with this set; especially at the sale price.",1321401600,4,553,3.9464285714285716
4568580,5,B00543R3WG,"I'm actually very pleased with this product! It's very cheap, and very good quality. There are, however, a couple of things that I feel I should point out.

First, the case that it comes in is a standard mass production case that most multi-disc sets use. Don't expect a lavish collectable case, especially for the price. The case is still very durable, and allows all of the movies to be stored in a small amount of space.

Second, the films in this set ARE NOT THE SPECIAL EDITIONS. They are standard edition, as if the first disc from each movie was put in here. While there are some special features, there are not a lot.

Next, the discs themselves appear to be great quality. All of mine worked extremely well, and there were no defects whatsoever, save one thing. The disc that I received for Deathly Hallows Part 1 is missing a cover. The disc is all black, and the title and copyright information are on there, but there is not picture. This, however does not in any way affect the viewing of the movie, and is only an aesthetic concern.

Also, the box that the DVD's come in is not the absolute best quality, but it is sturdy. It serves it's purpose, and it looks very nice!

PLease note, if you want something that's collectible, DO NOT BUY THIS SET. There are others out there that will better suit your needs. However, this set satisfies all of the casual viewers' needs. It presents the movies in an accessible, affordable manner, and is absolutely a great buy! I recommend this to all Harry Potter fans who wish to have all of the movies!

EDIT As of Nov 12, 2013: It seems that the original product that I wrote this review for has been altered in some way. I'm very sorry for any confusion that results form this.

At least the Lord of the Rings Theatrical set included some featurettes. And then a year later the Extended set was released. These sets happen to be published by Warner, which also manages Potter.

I rather have all 8 for $80 here.  Basically, there're worth $10 per movie and you get them all here for that price.

After 2 1/2 hours (probably past sleep time) per movie, the kids do not want to see interviews.  Maybe teens want to see the actors, but c'mon people, if the kids read the books and viewed the movies, they need to do something else outside of the Harry Potter franchise.

UK's version is Region Free and doesn't have any 50i encoding so these UK discs will work on all US Blu Ray players (when I finally get one). This is how Warner Brothers makes all of it's Blu Rays.  If you are STILL not conviced this will work on your US blu ray, then you ought to go check out Amazon UKs site on the last Harry Potter Region Free Box Set (movies 1-6).

So those are the types of collector editions I look for, so when they come out with a flimsy cardboard box like this one for Harry Potter, it just baffles my mind that they put so little effort into it. However, if you do not care at all about the box and are only in it for the movies themselves, then by all means get this! This is for you if you are only buying it for the movies! But if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful movie collection on your shelf, then it's not worth it if you already own all of the films.

I thought we'd get something similar in North America, but apparently not! :(",1317427200,11,609,4.5963302752293576
4568617,1,B00543R3WG,As many have said. Save your money. Especially if you are buying on Blu Ray. There is no reason to drop $90 on a set that will see major upgrades in an ultimate edition. Why they didn't just release it now and make millions of fans happy is beyond me. Such a great series of movies with such a horrible release of the entire series. Should have been a no brainer.,1317340800,10,363,4.126760563380282
4568618,5,B00543R3WG,"I do not understand why people are giving bad reviews because these don't have extended cuts/3D/new extras etc...  Let's see, we have all 8 movies, in BluRay at the quality they were individually released, for $11.25 per movie.  That seems like a very good deal to me.  I'm sure there will be extended releases with bells and whistles coming out in a year or two now that the series is done.  But it takes time to put that all together.  They are not claiming to be anything more then the movies and a few extras, and for that it is perfect!",1317254400,13,541,4.316831683168317
4568619,5,B00543R3WG,"Review the product for how it is advertised then.  It doesn't pretend to be a package containing extended versions or full of extras.  Just wanted the movies and this is what this is.  Excellent package, excellent cost.",1317168000,51,219,4.864864864864865
4568620,1,B00543R3WG,"You can tell from what's available on this boxed set that Warner Bros. was just trying to rush out a boxed set in time for Christmas, but, honestly, this is almost an insult to fans. If all you want are the movies, then here you go. If you want extended versions of the film, new behind the scenes extas, Blu-Ray exclusives, looks like the lazy good-for-nothings at Warner Bros. are going to make you another year.",1317081600,20,414,4.4605263157894735
4568621,4,B00543R3WG,"Um...I could frankly care less about a set of bonus features I will maybe watch one time.  Also, I could care less about 3D, so this seems like a good price on just the movies without forcing folks to get all the extra junk.

My wife will want this for Christmas and she will be thrilled with this.",1317081600,46,298,4.120689655172414
4568622,5,B00543R3WG,"These movies are fantastic! If you are just looking for a basic set I think it's a good value, since with Amazon's $89.99 price right now, that comes out to only just over $10 for each movie.",1316995200,14,191,4.1891891891891895

I wonder why we get charged double in the US ?",1316736000,24,106,3.772727272727273

8456157,5,B00543R3WG,Love the collection!  It's great!,1529539200,,33,5.6
8456158,1,B00543R3WG,I wouldn't not recommend buying this set. It looks really nice when you first get it but upon unwrapping it and pulling out the plastic case that contains the 8 dvds it looks like a copied set. I remained optimistic and went with the whole don't judge a book by its cover aspect. Anyways we get to movie number 3 and it's skipping horribly soooo there's that.. but since we always try not to jump to conclusions my husband tried a different DVD player aaaaand.... it started playing polar express.. ... call me crazy buuuuut I'm pretty sure good dvds are not supposed to do that.. Not impressed and more than slightly annoyed,1529539200,,625,4.539823008849558
8456159,5,B00543R3WG,"When this movie first came out, I refused to watch it since it was obviously a money grab. I still think it is, but now I am also of the opinion that it's a good movie with a cute little narrative. That being said, I don't think textbooks need to be turned into movies, and it takes a different tone toward the creatures than is in the actual ""Fantastic Beasts"" book. However, 9/10 have watched multiple times.",1529539200,,410,4.337662337662338
8456160,4,B00543R3WG,"Great movie overall.

Can't wait for the second one.",1529452800,,52,4.777777777777778
8456161,5,B00543R3WG,"I am very pleased with this set.  I did not need bells and whistles, like all sorts of behind the scenes or extra scenes or whatever.  I wanted the full set of movies because my collection was a mix of VHS and DVD and not complete.  This set is packed in a very sturdy case with all movies on separate DVDs.  The DVDs are substantial.  I've watched the first DVD and it has excellent video and audio.  I'm happy.  The price is pretty amazing as well.",1529452800,,450,4.162790697674419

8456164,1,B00543R3WG,Movie 3 plays as the polar express. Contacted the company and said they were going to send me a new movie and no sign,1529452800,,117,3.9166666666666665
8456165,5,B00543R3WG,I love having them all together in one case. These are still just as charming as they were when they first came out.,1529452800,,116,4.086956521739131
