8374025,5,B002MS4ZAO,"Larry Semon's penchant for wild slapstick actually put him in competition against Charlie Chaplin at the box office; THAT'S how popular Semon became during his more-than-a-decade film career. But unlike Chaplin & several others, Semon was a clown through & through. No smatterings of pathos or sentimentalism for him; he dealt with unrestrained hilarity, pure & simple. But this is something which isn't strong enough to dismiss such a hardworking silent comedian as Semon. While he had his flaws (perfectionism, overextravagance on productions), he was an innovator who dreamt up the wildest visual images possible, and could move & react uniquely funny to what was happening around him. Yes, Semon's character often created disaster; but it should also be noted that his ""simple"" actions to things created the most elaborately disasterous results you could ever imagine.
The first trio of shorts in this collection--""The Grocery Clerk"", ""A Simple Sap"", and ""The Bakery""--could almost be companion pieces to each other, for they're very similar in settings, situations & themes. Each has brilliant moments of physical slapstick, animation, and epic stunts. My faves? The cat caught on flypaper has an utterly charming & amusing conclusion. Semon's jalopy hitting a cavernous pothole, bouncing all its occupants out in all directions spectacularly. There's Semon displaying his clever physical comedy gifts with an angry boss & a large circular storage rack for pies & cakes to hysterical effect. And when Semon stages a fight in a general store, with flour flying everywhere, the result is shear anarchy. One of Semon's fave gags was the use of substances which ""ooze""; ink, oil & molasses were examples which he used to dump on character's heads. Downsides? Semon's frequent use of racial humor: Blacks were doused with flour, while whites were soiled with black soot. But Semon wasn't the only one guilty of this, for there was other comic talent of the time doing the same things. It should be noted that a lengthy title card to ""A Simple Sap"" declares this short to be Semon's very last film before his own extravagances ruined him, financially & emotionally, leading to his premature death in October 1928 at the tender age of 39. What a sad ending for such a funny, talented man.
""The Sportsman"" goes for Arabian Nights-type spoofery, with ""hunter"" Semon getting outsmarted by a rabbit (sound familiar?), playing games with a Sultan via carpets & wild chases, and even tangling with a lion. A particular cartoon-like gag has the lion actually frightening the subject of a still painting into a lake in the background of the picture! ""Frauds and Frenzies"" is an early (1918) treat, as it features not only Semon but a young Stan Laurel way before he met Oliver Hardy. As two saps on a prison chain gang, they clown & annoy their captors until they finally escape into civilian life, causing more trouble there. The two comedians compliment each other well in this short. However, any notions of them being a ""team"" here is quickly squelched when Semon goes solo to take on cops during an elaborate chase. That's when it's obvious that Semon is the star of this comedy, and Laurel is his co-star.
A superior volume to the Great Actors: Larry Semon series. Can't wait to see Volume 4!",1351900800,,3288,5.001824817518248
