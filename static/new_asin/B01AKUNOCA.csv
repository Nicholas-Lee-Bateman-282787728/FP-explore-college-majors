7606948,5,B01AKUNOCA,I watched the entire series on Syfy.  I enjoyed it so much I purchased the completed series on DVD when it was released in April 2016,1468627200,3,133,4.115384615384615

7606952,5,B01AKUNOCA,"Arrived as it should have. The Christmas episode (season 2???) was messed up at the ending, but I never contacted seller because it had been a while since it had arrived, so they didn't know.  i got to see it on reruns, but the dvd only messed up the last couple of minutes.  The rest is fine, and just got thru watching the last one last night.... sad it's over :(",1504483200,3,365,4.126760563380282

7606961,4,B01AKUNOCA,"One of those ""Drip-feed"" revelation type series, a bit like lost, but full of funny & quirky characters who develop over the five season & with  plenty of genuine Did not see that coming moments throughout.
On the negative side, for the first four seasons it pretty much the same plot for each episodes i.e. one of the residents of Haven develops a trouble that either injury's or kills other people (it's a wonder there's anybody left in Haven by the end of the series) & its all to the police to find them before they do too much damage, but with a story arc that continues throughout the entire series.
I guess what Haven tries to explore is how people cope differently with terrible problems & the way the community either helps or shuns them.
Although Haven was cancelled after the fifth season, the show does finish with all the various plot strands fully resolved.
So a really enjoyable series, perhaps not the most original but thoroughly addictive.",1488412800,,957,4.662721893491124
7606962,5,B01AKUNOCA,Arrived in good condition. Love this series.,1487980800,,44,5.428571428571429
7606963,5,B01AKUNOCA,Good Movie,1485734400,,10,4.5
7606964,5,B01AKUNOCA,I missed this series when it came out.  I have watched the entire set of seasons and I highly recommend it.,1485561600,6,107,4.095238095238095
7606965,3,B01AKUNOCA,"From what I saw of it, Haven (2010-15) was one of the better series to appear on the SyFy Channel in recent years.  It was engaging and intriguing.  I enjoyed the performances of Emily Rose, Eric Balfour, Lucas Bryant, and the rest of the cast, but unfortunately I lost touch with the series somewhere during the third season.  When the series concluded, I hoped that the complete series would be released at a reasonable price.  Released in the fall of 2016, the complete series on DVD (24 discs) was listed at $159.99.  The set dropped to $69.99 around Christmas, but is now back up at $119.99, which if you consider the numbers below, seems to be rather expensive.

Complete season releases have become a mixed bag.  Some provide a savings over buying the individual seasons, and some like this release do not.  The price for the individual seasons of Haven on DVD, have fluctuated frequently.  At this writing, the current prices at Amazon are as follows:
Season 1: $7.49 (4 DVDs)
Season 2: $7.69 (4 DVDs)
Season 3: $12.74 (4 DVDs)
Season 4: $12.95 (4 DVDs)
Season 5 Volume 1: $14.99 (4 DVDs)
The Final Season Volume 2: $15.49 (4 DVDs)

The individual sets total up to $71.35 for 24 DVDs, which is almost $49 less than the complete season release.  I do not know if there are any bonus materials that are exclusive to the complete series set, but I presume that there are none.  I like Haven, but just looking at the numbers, the complete series set is not a very good value.  Paying an additional $49 for more compact packaging, does not make any sense to me.

Some seasons of Haven have been released on Blu-Ray.  I own&nbsp;, and the series looks quite good, despite the subdued color palette sometimes featured in the program.  Hopefully the entire series will be released in high definition at a reasonable price.  I saved quite a bit when I purchased the region free Blu-ray release of&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of the Region 1 Blu-ray set.  Warehouse 13 is also a SyFy production, so perhaps something similar might also happen regarding Haven.",1485475200,2,2048,4.689075630252101
7606966,5,B01AKUNOCA,It came on time. Very good product.,1484697600,,35,4.142857142857143

7606968,5,B01AKUNOCA,excellent series. good luck to emily in future projects.,1483315200,,56,5.333333333333333
7606969,1,B01AKUNOCA,"when i tried to watch it, season one had disc 2 and two disc three. where is disc one. it really sucks to watch a show when you missed the begining!",1481587200,3,148,3.806451612903226
7606970,5,B01AKUNOCA,bought for my daughter,1480896000,,22,4.75
7606971,5,B01AKUNOCA,Fascinating tv series. Interesting and original episodes and a good ending to the series.,1471737600,2,89,5.428571428571429
8747667,5,B01AKUNOCA,Love this series. The stories are interesting as are the characters. Basically another version of x-files in a small upper east coast town. Worth a watch if you like Sci-fi fantasy type shows.,1533254400,,192,4.848484848484849
8747668,4,B01AKUNOCA,"All 8 corners of the sleeve were rubbed, crunched or ripped even though it was loosely plastic wrapped",1531785600,,102,4.722222222222222
8747669,5,B01AKUNOCA,"I received this series yesterday, and have finished the first season. The show has great roots, based on a story by S. King. It reminds me a little of the X-Files in its dealing with paranormal situations (no extra-terrestrial stories, so far). The lead characters are good, though no Mulder and Scully. I feel engrossed, however, and find it hard to stop watching when I have to.",1530489600,,380,4.686567164179104
8747670,3,B01AKUNOCA,"OK. So here is the deal..(Pause to read the whole thing, I do give a review of the series) IF I had known this was a Steven King (not even worried if I spelled it correct or not), I would NEVER have started watching this series. I watched the whole thing! I was ""in love"" to begin with. Then towards the end of the seasons, I get to thinking ""whaaat tha #%$#%. This is starting to go towards a S. King line of BS"" I think at the end the season PRIOR to the last one, I finally see it.. scrolling down my screen.. ""based on book by.."" My inside response was jumping up and down screaming and pulling my hair and throwing things at the TV all while cursing the day I saw the first episode preview.. Outside, my jaw dropped to the floor and I immediately began to wonder WHAT KIND OF STUPID this was going to end with.
There are great characters with mystery, intrigue, love, family, hatred, lies, strange abilities (which now the name escapes me). Rebirth, again and again... but only for one.. love triangles. It moves at a good pace, things don't take a whole season to happen, except for major ones because, well, they simply make no sense as to why they are happening. Haven is as safe a haven as one could be in when they are born with The Troubles. (Remembered it!!) After all, a lot of the people there have them and you need a place to educate you when on how to control things that can cause you to toast loved ones alive when you could barely make toast the day before.
The two bickering brothers and what they are hiding adds to the comedy. Loved them.
So.. you deal with the mystery for a few years, then when it comes to nearing the close, it's still ""alright"" for the first part.. then it keeps going downhill.. Good goes bad, bad goes good, but who can trust the good to good when it was so bad.. and the sacrifices of trying to save the town before they all die..THEN!! Come that stupid ending that only Steven King can do over and over and over and still get away with it..
As I said, I can only rate the show, not the DVDs. But I loved it until the last.. I'll just go for ""the last season"".",1528848000,3,2107,4.179361179361179
8747671,5,B01AKUNOCA,Literally just finished binge watching this show on Netflix but then had to buy it because once wasn't enough.,1526774400,,110,4.842105263157895
8747672,1,B01AKUNOCA,It's so bad I don't even know where to begin.,1526428800,,45,3.6
8747673,5,B01AKUNOCA,"Really loved this series, but missed the last 2 or 3 episodes. This was a good deal for the whole series. Thanks.",1522454400,,113,4.181818181818182
8747674,5,B01AKUNOCA,I have been waiting for the whole series to come out as a single item. I hate having to shuffle boxes and disks. I missed the last season when we dropped TV from our house due to pricing. So now I can watch the whole series without interruptions or commercials.,1515456000,2,261,4.24
8747675,1,B01AKUNOCA,"Bottom Line: Just go Blu-Ray! But here's the Good, the Bad and the Ugly: This is an amazing show! However, the saying 'you pay for what you get' is very true in this case... That being said I wish I had splurged on the individual Blu-Ray seasons rather than the DVD Complete Series Box Set. I would definitely recommend to anyone considering this purchase to go Blu-Ray (the difference is very obvious). Now the Bad & the Ugly: Whoever packaged this for shipment apparently could have cared less, I received the box set (which is quite large) in an unrealistically HUGE box with absolutely no stuffing, bubble wrap, etc. to protect it. Even though the complete series case was wrapped in the usual shrink wrap it was extremely damaged with scratches, tears and rips on just about each side. Overall, regardless of the huge price difference, I wouldn't recommend this product based on the viewing quality of the DVD vs. that of a Blu-Ray, as well as the condition it was received in.",1512432000,6,982,4.682080924855492
8747676,5,B01AKUNOCA,"Great series.  Love the interaction between the characters.  The wild and wooly ""troubles"" add a certain panache and promises to be greatly diverse.  Very, very enjoyable.",1504569600,,171,5.5
