2344454,2,B0009ZE9DK,"Highway to Heaven is one of my favorite dramatic series so I looked forward to its release into the DVD realm. Unfortunately, we now have two DVD seasons of this Michael Landon classic that features the edited episodes shown in syndication.  Approximately 2-3 minutes are cut from each of these episodes.

I am fortunate to have eight of these installments recorded on VHS from the show's original network run on NBC.  I know these episodes very well and it bothers me that they are not complete!  The episode ""Birds of a Feather"" (my favorite) features a dramatic scene in which Jonathan makes the ultimate sacrifice to call attention to toxic waste dumping.  Don't look for that scene here though.  It's not on the DVD version of this episode.

This collection also features digital break-up on part two of ""The Monster"".  Also, the video and audio are not in-sync!  The actors speak and the voice comes in a second or two later!  It is very distracting to watch.

I did enjoy the audio commentary on ""The Torch"" by Mrs. Landon and Highway to Heaven producer Mr. Kent McCray.  I had hoped for other ""extras"" but unfortunately they followed in the path of all the scenes cut for syndicated purposes.

Highway to Heaven is one of the best family dramas ever produced. It should be seen and preserved on DVD in its original NBC format.

Let's hope that on the third try this series is featured in a COMPLETE set!  Only then will the angels rejoice...",1128988800,42,1449,4.649606299212598
2344455,5,B0009ZE9DK,"There are many great episodes of this great series, but the two best episodes are on this season of episodes. The first deals with the angels going to a camp for kids, but not just any kids, these kids all have cancer. It's an emotional two part episode that is one of the best episodes of any show. The other episode is my personal favorite because so many people now adays can relate to it. It's the finale episode on this collection. It's about a loner overweight girl who binges on doughnuts, saying there for a party or friends when she orders the dozen doughnuts. When she tutors the failing jock of the school, whom she has a crush on, his girlfriend decides to get even and tells her that she will let her join the exclusive club in school known as the ""Ditchers"". So excited the overweight girl can't wait and tells her mom she's done it, she's finally made friends, but when she arrives at the girls home, it's innitiation night and the unthinkable happens. It's the best episode in my opinion because it shows kids that being different is alright and that if you don't like things about yourself you can change them. I love this show. Do whatever you have to but this season is a MUST OWN set!!!!!!",1124409600,25,1209,4.426008968609866

2344481,5,B0009ZE9DK,"Highway to Heaven is a wonderful show from the 80's. The show seems to be able to conquer even the most apathetic person and drive them into endless bouts of emotion. I can vouch for this personally. The show seems to touch you in a way a show from this time period couldn't do not even from an Oscar winning movie. Michael Landon and his very good on screen as well as off screen friend Victor French give outstanding performances, often shedding tears and acting out character driven drama to perfection. I recommend this dvd as well as the other seasons. Great Show!",1410652800,,569,4.533980582524272

2344494,5,B0009ZE9DK,This is the next season in the series of Highway to Heaven and is a must for anyone who liked the first season.  Jonathan and Mark keep traveling from place to place helping those in need of guidance or heavenly intervention.  I especially like the season opening episode about children that have cancer and that there is a camp they can go to just to be kids without all the pressures that the world puts on them.  They can be themselves and not worry about their illness for a week.  This is for anyone who likes actor Michael Landon and Victor French and anyone who likes spiritual content in a program.,1402704000,,606,4.4324324324324325

2344498,3,B0009ZE9DK,"Some good things about the Highway To Heaven Season 2 dvd release,  1. Low price  2. A Play all feature (A&E release did not have have this.)  3. Inspiring thought provoking stories.  4. The set comes in a standard size case, so it don't take much shelf space.  Some things wrong with this release.  1. EDITED episodes. (I compared the episode times with the A&E release from a few years ago. All of them about 45 min long instead of 48 to 49 min like the Season 1 Mill Creek set.  2. The discs are just stacked on top of each other on a spindle where discs can easily be scratched if you don't handle them very carefully.  3. No episode info to be found inside the case.  Now I love this show as much now as I did as a kid in the 80s, with the drama and humor mixed in, but if you already have the A&E dvd release, then stay away from this re-release of Highway to Heaven, season 2. GET season 1 (Mill Creek), cuz that has extra footage (3-4 min per episode). I still don't know about season 3 (Mill Creek) if the episodes are CUT or NOT. Waiting to find that out. Good luck.",1398384000,,1076,4.085714285714285

2344501,5,B0009ZE9DK,"Michael Landon was a master at creating emotion.  The paring with Mr. French was a perfect match for Landon.  Too bad that he died young - We would have had another wonder TV to buy on DVD.  Besides the chemistry between Landon & French, the ability to bring out emotion, this TV show had outstanding writers.  The subject matter was consistently Good.

There's always a mix of serious drama , and a little humor in every episode of Highway to Heaven. This show was shortly after he finished with ""Little House "" but retains some of that same feeling you get when watching  Little House. You can also hear that a similar style of music is used as the same composer did both shows.

I pre-purchased the Mill Creek season 2, and was very disappointed to learn that it was exactly like the A&E version - Cut and edited.  It was a bit of a bait and switch as season 1 was all of the uncut versions.  In addition, the words the actors were saying did not match the mouths, which was a bit annoying. Also, on a couple episodes, some words were muted out.  Very disappointed.  Great wonderful show, but the production of season 2 is terrible I hate to say.",1383609600,10,548,4.3431372549019605

Until I read some of the reviews for Mill Creek's Re-releasing of Highway to Heaven season 2, I was looking forward to purchasing this. But now, not so much. On the cover, it says ""Original Broadcast Edits"". But if you look closely (for anyone who hasn't bothered reading the label on the bottom left corner), unlike season 1, it doesn't say ""UNCUT"". On the aforementioned website, there's a note from Mill Creek saying they don't have a confirmation on whether these episodes are edited, that they only removed ""UNCUT"" to avoid misunderstandings. After reading these complaints, I have the unfortunate feeling that they're right. How can Mill Creek obtain rights for a series' unedited episodes of one season, and not another? That's anybody's guess. I looked on their website, and 3rd Rock from the Sun & Roseanne also have been re-released with editited versions as well. I guess you can't really depend on Mill Creek after all. To read the article, here is the link: [...] (You'll have to copy & paste first)",1381104000,12,1057,4.877777777777778

2344540,5,B0009ZE9DK,"This is an awesome series.  A ""feel good"" program with many episodes that leaves the viewer feeling positive.  Michial Landon had an excellent talllent as a writer as well as a good actor.  I like this program.
It is however Scripturally inacurate...  People don't become angles and they don't disagree with God Who's always referred to as ""the boss"".
No TV program is 100% believable nor are they intended to be but this one is a gem always worth watching.",1329609600,,457,4.675

2344551,5,B0009ZE9DK,"I watched this show as a kid and was instantly drawn into the series because of its unique combination of humor and drama. The show always tugged at my heartstrings one minute and had me laughing out loud the next.

The lead character, Johnathan Smith, is a supernatural hero mainly because he's an angel sent by God. Played by Michael Landon, the angel Johnathan gets assignments from his ""boss"" including such jobs as a cancer camp kid's counselor, a police officer, sportswriters and many more.

His companion and sidekick, played by a gruff looking Victor French, is almost the typical grumpy, cynical ex-cop. Mark Gordon tries to act tough, and is usually the one that blurts out the typical misjudgments about strangers. By the end of each episode, he's usually eating his blunt words.

Though slightly out-of-date, this series still contains a lot of tender topics that are still relevant today. So, I would suggest this series to anyone that likes a good tear-jerker.",1189814400,3,975,4.932926829268292

2344553,1,B0009ZE9DK,"If you own a TV Guardian that mutes the bad words, forget it working with Seasons 1 and 2 of Highway To Heaven. The Guardian needs Closed Captioning to work. Some episodes don't hevs swearing but that is not the norm. I gave 1 star because of No CC and edited Episodes and Swearing.

And too expensive not to have Closed Captioning.

What a pity.",1139875200,10,346,4.3076923076923075
2344554,5,B0009ZE9DK,"Thourgly enjoyed season 2, i saw the series on television many years ago so i cant say or remember exactly what's been edited on certain scenes.

All i can say is that Michael Landon and Victor French were very inspirational to us all and unfortunatly since there passing on there hasn't been anyone yet today that can make these quality loving family shows.

Hopefully the final three sasons will be released soon.
