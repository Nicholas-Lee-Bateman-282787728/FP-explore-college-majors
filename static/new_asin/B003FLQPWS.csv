8396009,5,B003FLQPWS,"This was a pretty good documentary on the life of William Holden, thank God, i know more about his life after reading better books
and other materials whom knew William Holden better than Robert Wagner. Robert Wagner was a and is a terrible narrator; actor;
and entertainer and I also believe he had something to do with the death of his wife, Natalie Wood, but, I will not go into that now.
This is a synopsis on William Holden's documentary via the Hollywood Collection and they did an excellent job at covering his life
story. William Holden had a very hard life. He was a very fine actor and hated the media. He was also a very private man with an
alcholic problem, but, many hollywood stars in the 40's; 50's; and so on did as well. I wish that the writers and/or producers had
gotten a better narrator, but, all in the autobiography of his life was covered pretty well. If you are a William Holden fan you will like
this documentary, after all, hollywood is not going to tell you everything, only as much as they want you to know and they did interview
other actors whom knew William well thank goodness. I just purchased it and it was worth the money. Mrs. D.L. WC Sept. 17, 2013.",1379376000,,1187,4.4
8396010,4,B003FLQPWS,"This is a reflection of what people in his industry thought of Holden.  However, it really doesn't explain this man in any depth at all.  Simple, complex, tormented, many views on his character but we still have very little understanding of who he really was.  His characterizations in his films are drawn from something deep within him.  It's evident in his facial expressions, but no one, even those who apparently knew him and worked with him either didn't really know him as well as they thought or were not willing to share with his vast public what it was about him that allowed him to portray such a range of characters in his films.  I read his first director told him that acting came from within a person, and that they had to draw their film characters from within themselves.  If this is what made him such an outstanding actor then Bill Holden must have been a truly troubled man.  The fact that he has always been identified as a notorious womanizer and drunk does not tell us who he was.  This type of behaviour, if indeed all of the things written and said about him are true concerning these two problems, only comes from within one's self.",1377734400,3,1157,4.528846153846154
8396011,5,B003FLQPWS,"I recently watched Mr Holden in the Clint Eastwood directed story, ""Breezy,"" which I absolutely love and some time ago I wrote a review on that. The story was great and William Holden was as he always has been in any film...just brilliant...and whatever makes an actor that kind of person that they can even be in some stories that are not the best...but still can make it come out fine because they just have to appear in it.
Spencer Tracy, Robert Redford, some others had it too but I'm near 70 yr old now & I never saw an actor that kept me so glued to a movie he was in as Bill Holden does.
It was so sad when we lost him so young in 1981. He still does give us great pleasure though because of DVD'S and technology. You were the best William Holden, without any doubt. This story of Mr. Holden is one of the best ever shown...he was why I loved the movies so much all my life because he showed they can be good indeed...and did he ever leave us some good ones!",1371513600,5,965,4.111111111111111
