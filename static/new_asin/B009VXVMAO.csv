5369615,5,B009VXVMAO,"Southland is one of the best cop shows ever to air.  It's got that immediate sense of danger that comes from hand-held camera work and well-executed, fast-paced action (it's not all frenetic, head-achy camera work, though; it's used to good effect).  The plots are intelligent and at times surprising and even brutal.  The characters are well-developed, and their personalities, back-stories and situations will stay with you, even haunt you the way certain characters or scenes from The Shield were able to, which is probably the show I would most compare it to, though Southland is not about the anti-hero.  It is similar in that it is one of the only shows that will leave you bolt-upright and riding an adrenaline rush right up to that last second--and then you can't believe you have to wait for next week (or next season) for the next episode.  I think Sons of Anarchy is the only other show currently airing that has this effect to this degree.  Again, though, Southland is not about the anti-hero; so it's not like Sons in that way at all.  The cops are heroes on this show, well revered, if completely human and at times very flawed.  This show seems to me to be a kind of a cross between the cop-centric, officer-on-the-beat episodes of Third Watch with the grittiness of the Shield.  What a wild ride all of these seasons in one set would be.  If you haven't seen this show before, I envy you the experience coming your way.  Please note that this show has ""seasons"" on par with the average BBC show in length, which means that with three full seasons of Southland included in this set, you will still only get 26 episodes.  So, consider it a single season's worth of shows (well, maybe a season from like the 80's, when networks actually still made 26-episode seasons).  Still, worth even overpaying for, it's that good.  If you haven't seen the first season, grab that and extend the awesome by 7 more episodes (yes, 7).  Oh, by the way, Southland incorporates an amount of uncensored swearing (at least my 1st season set does) that would make Sipowicz from NYPD Blue blush.  It's not that non-stop vulgarity the Wire delivers throughout; it's more like pointed punctuation that is realistic and not written around or out.  It works, if that sort of thing isn't a deal-breaker for you.  (When the show airs on TV, most of the curse words are dropped out of the sound.  Hopefully, this set continues the tradition of just leaving the colorful, realistic language in there, though.)  In short, a fantastic cop show that has probably flown under your radar.  Spend whatever they're charging; it may seem like too much, but after you're sucked into a few episodes, you'll think it was a steal.",1357603200,15,2702,4.694267515923567
5369616,5,B009VXVMAO,It's about time!! When NBC cancelled the show I never had time to invest in the new seasons!! I'm glad they are Finally coming to DVD and all together? Hell yeah!!! I've heard nothing but good things about this series!!! Where's is Regina kings Emmy nomination? Has it really been four years since season one? Man it's about time for this release!!!!,1357344000,3,350,4.661290322580645
5369617,5,B009VXVMAO,"This tv show is the most realistic take on an LAPD officer's daily life. The style is real and gritty. The action has a specific pace that feels real. The acting is superb! The amount of episodes are small per season, but thats what makes it worth-while! Too many episodes can make a series boring, this show keeps your interest whole. If I had to pick a favorite season, it would be season 3. If you have seen the movie End of Watch, you are not seeing a realistic take on LAPD. This is where you will find it! This is The Wire's side-kick!",1356566400,16,541,4.211538461538462

5369625,4,B009VXVMAO,"Great show and castmostly.  Tami was way too stupid and irritating, Liv had too many weird partners, and Sherman was too much all over the board.  Would've liked to see how Cooper made it into another season, if he did.  His character was the deepest and the darkest, suicide by his own fellow cops might've seemed easy by the end.",1471824000,,331,4.483333333333333

5369644,5,B009VXVMAO,"I won't waste your valuable time giving you my own personal opinion regarding one the best shows that was ever on TV about the LAPD. You already know that. What I did want to share with you was the outstanding quality of the DVD itself. The video and sound are both incredible. Because the series was filmed in a very special way using a hand-held camera, the light does come across just slightly dark in a few very rare scenes.  FIVE STARS all the way. Awesome!!",1454198400,,463,4.383720930232558

This is not just another police procedural, in fact I would say that the police actions are secondary to the main theme which is the relationships among the various characters.",1437782400,,338,5.163636363636364
5369656,4,B009VXVMAO,Bought this show for my husband and ended up getting hooked on it myself. This series is probably the most realistic cop show out there (husband has a criminal justice degree). We really enjoy the show but hate that it was cancelled!,1437696000,,233,4.571428571428571

Was so great I cried, I never cry. Also hate NBC/TNT for canceling it. It truly was an amazing show. The acting is superb and the show itself is very very realistic. No insane out of this world stuff you see with most cop shows. This has everything from traffic stops, and speeding tickets, running a red light, to terrorist threats, store robberies, gang fights.

5369686,5,B009VXVMAO,"This is small set considering everything you get, but the discs are all here and you can watch these really quickly. I don't know why the seasons were so short because this show is a quality police program. There are shows that never get into the officers themselves, the journey they experience. Sure, there are chases and shoot outs (and this show there are a lot of foot pursuits) but the cops themselves get the air time in this one. I love it. It's what drives me to these kind of shows. Some people are overwhelmed by their experience, others reach heights of courage they never imagined, that is compelling.

5369698,3,B009VXVMAO,"Loved the first season.
The rest became conventional.
Homosexual, macho cop who can be rude to anyone he pleases.  Female cops who take big risks to prove themselves to the male cops and ""go in first"" even when they are medically at risk and making a stupid and even unethical choice.  One small one goes running alone through the dark woods after a dangerous criminal who targets women.  Hmm.
Another is having an affair with her partner's son and keeping it a secret-and that partner is a shoot-from-the-mouth-and-think-afterwards woman.  A lot of ""What were you thinking?""
Characters are there and then suddenly gone with no explanation-or I'm just thick and not keeping up.

Seasons 2 continues the momentum of Season 1 then flows through the rest.  The acting is good and the stories are compelling.

As for the product itself, it's barely 4 stars. I say that not only because there are very little special features and I can't stand the WB's new dvd lay out with the circles for selection buttons, but also because disc 3 (season 3 disc 1) didn't work on my blu-ray player. It worked fine on my laptop. All the other discs worked fine, but they all had the blotches on the bottom side of the disc..

I bought it for just under $20, so it was an excellent deal, but I like when all the discs work on one player in my house and have specialized selection buttons.",1390694400,,677,4.121212121212121

5369719,5,B009VXVMAO,"Today, it's hard to give a show enough support or time to develop its audience, or run the folly of being moved around to suit the TV studio's program lineup.  A precursor to this one that struggled to get similar support from the studios was 'Boomtown', which only lasted one season and also takes place in L.A. It stars Donnie Wahlberg Boomtown - Season One (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boomtown-Season-One-Donnie-Wahlberg/dp/B00005JMMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boomtown Season One Donnie Wahlberg</a>&nbsp;This show definitely places perspective of the life of a police officer. With a great cast, it portrays a more truthful, gritty version of what they deal with day-in and day-out, leaving the audience to ponder how long they can last leading that kind of lifestyle, with the adrenaline rushes and heartbreaks (love/hate relationship with the job)? A modern day version of a 70's show with a similar idea but centered around one person called, 'Police Story' (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Police-Story-Scott-Brady/dp/B00266PDZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Police Story Scott Brady</a>&nbsp;rather than an ensemble, which is in this case. A lot more realistic than the fluffy Rookie Blue, from Toronto . When I originally saw the series when it first came out in 2009, I knew right away that this show had potential after being pulled-in immediately by the music of Dulce Pontes', Cancao do Mar [...], used in the opening credits of show.  The cinematography helped also create riveting drama and gave license to allow the actors to do their jobs and move around more freely, and to successfully allow the audience to see it from both first person and third person perspectives. I like the way the photography allows the location of L.A. be another character of the show, It was also nice to see actors from other great shows guest appear on this one, such as Carl Lumbly [...] from 'Alias.' Having lived in L.A. for fifteen years and call it my hometown, even though I have moved from there since, the show brings a sense of nostalgia and laughter (in several scenes; especially in the language, attitude, and variety of its people) that perhaps only those who live there would get.",1389312000,,2273,5.491428571428571

Michael Cudlitz played Bull in Band of Brothers; Shawn Hatosy, Brendan Behan in Borstal Boys; Ben McKenzie in the OC; and Tom Everett Scott reappears in an adult roll after skirting the Brat Pack in decades past. Ben plays the rookie whose trainer John Cooper introduces Ben and the audience to the rigors of policing the streets of Easts LA. Toms Russell copes with being seriously injured on the job while Shawns Sammy copes with a flaky drug addicted wife. The show distinguishes itself from others of the genre by dealing with the officers personal issues while they deal with the cases and situations thrown at them on the street. They have to struggle with drug dependency, personal conflicts, moral issues that blend black and white into gray.

I love this show. I like the procedural aspects that are reminiscent of Adam-12 and Dragnet. Then you combine that with personal dramas and gritty reality, its probably the best cop show ever produced. It literally pays homage to every great cop show that came before it. I lived in LA for 11 years, and knew a few cops. And this show definitely strikes the right balance when it comes to vibe and attitude. And living in LA as long as I did, and seeing the things you see in different neighborhoods, they cover the variety of police activity really well.

There really haven't been any successful LA based cop shows since Dragnet, Adam-12, and I guess you can count TJ Hooker if you want. Which is weird to me. LA is such fertile ground for criminal activities and story lines. LAPD has a long and colorful history. It all screamed to be made into a show like this. Thank goodness somebody finally did. And to think this show was dropped by it's first network.

No tv show will ever BE reality. But this show does get a lot of the moods, situations, vibes, attitudes and realities right. I think the best you can hope for from a tv show is that it leaves the right impression if it's trying to portray something real. And I can't think of a better show that leaves the right impression of police work, from the uniformed patrol officer, to the homicide detective.",1367366400,,1567,4.434027777777778

Any way I really love this show and I hope the season 5 dvd doesn't take long to come out.

The ""bonus material"" i.e deleted scenes is MINIMAL--each disc has maybe 1 or 2 very brief scenes that you can watch but they are isolated (i.e. you can't tell the DVD to insert the deleted scenes into the progression of the show and watch it all together). but that aside, the actors and stories are unapologetically realistic. The show comes off as highly authentic. Can't wait for Season 5 to come out on DVD!",1364601600,,576,4.151785714285714
5369913,2,B009VXVMAO,"I definitely liked the original premise of this show and think that Ben McKenzie is an extraordinary, intuitive actor who was able to do the impossible, get me, my family and many friends invested in a character in a cop show.  However, as much as we stuck with it to see him and enjoyed his scenes with Arija Bareikis and other supporting characters from his family or who were crime victims, the very choppy writing and lack of character exploration and development became tiresome.  There was a real rut by the third season with the character who was supposed to be training him and did anything but.  Everything that we'd hoped for got lost along the way and things became a predictable disappointment.  By the fourth season, it's hard to watch much at all.  The chance for a new partner went bust with a choice forced by the network that was completely unrealistic and with a character none of us cared for.  Any chance for the personal stories that had supposedly been the calling card disappeared.  It's too bad, but I'd have to say it became a shallow series of short stories that made it a procedural of a different kind.  It's not about solving crimes, but it never finds the focus or priorities to tell stories about the characters that have been introduced.  After a terrific set up with lots of potential, falling short is more of a disappointment.  The second season still had promise, but that's when it was canceled by NBC.  TNT took over after that.  Of their episodes, I'd recommend Discretion and Graduation Day from the third season and the first and last, Wednesday and Thursday from the fourth.  Not really worth it unless you like very quick, short scenes that don't really go anywhere in the big picture.  There's good acting, but the writing doesn't measure up and deliver.",1364428800,2,1798,4.6847133757961785

5369917,3,B009VXVMAO,"Southland is an exceptional real-life police drama, or as real as a Hollywood account can be.  It's edgy and focuses of character development and storyline more than typical action dramas.  Granted, there is action, and each episode has a twist, but it complements the story and the characters rather than taking its place.  I cant rate this police drama high enough  its excellentyou won't be disappointed.  5 stars.  However, this compilation disk set is made in very low quality.  Colors are very dark, even hard to see shadowed faces at times, and sound lower quality as well.  When got to the end of Season 1 pirating literature in all Asian languages typical to cheap pirated disks I have been handed down in the past.  The first set I bought from on on-line retailer I returned hoping they got a bad pirated batch.  Bought the same thing from Amazon and same quality issues.  TNT must have farmed out the disk manufacture to a poor quality source.  Again, excellent show, and worth watching, just be aware of below expectations DVD quality.

The accuracy is quite amazing and the language as well. It's great to see a series that doesn't sugar-coat the life of a cop. Also, the casting is suberb, these actors make you feel they are actually in this life. It's my favorite show and hope to see it continue for many more seasons. A+++",1363564800,,443,4.162790697674419
5369920,5,B009VXVMAO,"I will be brief. Characters are real, situations real, the way they handle them , almost real. (In reality a little more force would have been used by LA cops) (Some tear gas, more units caled to riot or public disturbance scenes (sorry two patrol cars for mobs of 30 Latino gang members seems a tad too much to accept. Still it has great characters, a nice ensemble cast, some fly camera work in chase scenes, and a deep rich background and backdrop. The dialogue is as real as it can be with profanity.

I have tow main issues with the show
1)TNT in its greed---in Season 2-3-4 (NOT season 5 now which runs longer) had episodes clocking in without commercials at 40.23 seconds. Come on guys-ina 60 minute progema you want us to accept 33% of the progeam is commercials? If you say ""But don't ALL one hour dramas do that today""?> Answer NO. the running time on networks (ABC , CBS, NBC etc) is 43-44 m inutes per episode. TNT greedy for commercial revenue lets an extra 3 minutes of commercials air meaning three minutes LESS of an episode. Not fair.

2)Violence.-gunshots-NO Blood. COme on--in a gritty police show--Not ONE bullet ""impact"" blood quibb shot. The series has yet to show ONE. I assume TNT has a ban on that (its not on any other TNT show either)..but if you are going to be as realistic as possible..a few impact shots would add greatly to the reality, the consequences of actions and make for the true most gritty polcie show since Police Story in the 70s! I mean when people are shot they DO bleed. This series finds ways to HIDE that. (People turn their backs, shots come from distant angles or are just hidden). I do not see how it is fine to say words like S..T and F..K but not show a couple  realistic shoot outs. Fix the ban on gunshot impacts and we have the best cop series to ever air...Season 5 picks up where Season 4 eneded and the show gets better every season. So let's habe a few Dirty Harry gunshot moments and not get our uniforms in a bunch over a few specs of blood.",1363564800,,2003,4.3646112600536195

5369940,5,B009VXVMAO,"SYNOPSIS:  Southland is an updated version of Adam 12, with more graphic visuals and current dialog. It has a unadulterated storyline which lifts it above the current trash that's on TV land. The look is also unusual for TV. It is presented with high contrast and deep blacks, perhaps to represent the stark theme or the LA smog city skyline? ;)  Normally, film will require a bleach by-pass to retain the silver for the grainy contrast look. However, Southland is shot with RED cameras. Digital process all the way.

DVD FORMAT:  The biggest gripe with fans that bought Season 2 (initial release) was having to fork out the money again.
The first release of Season 2 was a HUGE error. It was available only through the studio's manufacture-on-demand format. The inferior DVD-R release could be due to the show being cancelled by NBC after its first season before being picked up by TNT subsequently, with budget cuts all around for the following seasons.

Buyers issues with manufacture-on-demand (DVD-R):  Will always have to pay more because it costs more for the extra manual handling; Most likely not being able to playback in a computer's optical media drive; Poorer image quality because it had to be crammed into one DVD-5; Lacking menu options; No subtitles for those who love to know every line in the show and those who are hearing impaired; No special features because there's no room on the disc.

The new season 2 in this box set is now on a dual layer (DVD-9) format. This should translates to better image resolution?, English subtitles and more special features (eg. Location Tours, Deleted Scenes, etc).

If you have bought the first release of Season 2, take comfort in being able to buy this new set at a good price from Amazon. This is the one you want to keep.

PACKAGING:  Warner Bros has done well with this 2,3,4 box set. It's now in a beautiful 6 discs Keep Case, unlike some DVDs that come in the despised and very nasty, Digipaks.",1361318400,,1958,4.715542521994135

I mean, sure it's not that big of a deal, but why?  Also, what happened to the opening credit theme song?  I liked it. It was catchy and cool.  Now they replaced it with some gay sounding music, and they put the original music as background for the main menu. WHY? Other than that, I love the show and I really do like the set.

It's ridiculous that all of the crappy reality shows get promoted over quality television.

I spent the dough on getting Season 2 from WB direct last year and was a little ticked off that I had to double-dip to get it with seasons 3 & 4, but all was forgive after rewatching it all again. I got it at Target for only $34.99 this week. What a deal!

5369967,5,B009VXVMAO,"This show is fantastic and for all the reasons others have said.
Now with regards to packaging all 3 seasons 2,3,4 in one set,
yes our first impression is that those of us who bought season 2
are not happy with buying it again.  And after waiting years for
season 3, why can't we buy it separately?

But there is another way to look at it.  The first is price:
at $40, this is actually less than the price of buying both season 1 and 2.
So, we are getting an entire season for no additional charge.
Furthermore, as opposed to the DVD-R manufactured on demand character
for season 2, Warner is actually treating the series with the respect
it deserves by producing 2,3,4 in the normal way -- which, important to me,
means that it has subtitles both in English and French.  (Part of the appreciated
gritty realism of the show is the on-location shooting, which loses some of the
dialog for me -- so, I want the English subtitles.)  So, actually, we are not
buying the same season 2 -- we are buying a season 2 with subtitles.

So, there is a bright side to this -- and let's buy and support this show so that
we can get more new seasons out of the powers that be.",1359676800,48,1161,4.254545454545455

If this was solely a mistake, then Warner Bros. should step up and knock an extra five or ten bucks off the price, to show good faith.  Either that, or issue a package with just seasons three and four.

As others have said in reviews of seasons one and two -- not sure about the reviews on THIS item, since they seem a little too vociferous -- this is one of the better crime shows told from the police point of view -- right up there with ""The Wire"", etc.  Good writing, acting, etc.  Too bad Warner Bros. had to sour the deal with die-hard fans with this ill-thought out, last collection.",1359590400,7,770,4.140939597315437
