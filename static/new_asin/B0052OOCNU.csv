8454091,5,B0052OOCNU,"Excellent and shockingly detail-oriented review of the City of Gold. Sure, it is entertaining as hell, but it actually is useful. Not only for the traveller, but for those interested in living there - you get the feel for what makes the city tick. For those on their way, you will get useful advice. For those who have left, it will bring back memories.",1442361600,,353,4.53125
8454092,4,B0052OOCNU,"My wife, who is South African, and I watched and thoroughly enjoyed this humorous ""documentary."" It really does give a true overview of what is Jo'burg.

Of course, no one sitting could cover every single aspect of life, politics, economics, crime, etc., etc., etc. in South Africa. But this movie covers a lot of ground and does a good job of presenting the material entailed.",1341446400,,377,4.8
