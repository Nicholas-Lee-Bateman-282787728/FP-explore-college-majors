4961454,4,B0065S7P04,"Cute and funny series AKA as ""Palace"", released in 2006.  The ""Palace"" version has a much better and more accurate translation for the subtitles. It may still be available through the Yesasia USA site.  The older version is definitely superior to this new version simply because of the issue with poor translations in this version.

This is one of those ""what if"" type stories where Korea remained a monarchy even into current times after WWII.  It is a romantic comedy with engaging characters and pretty good performances by the principal actors.  It centers around the crown prince, Lee Shin, who is facing an impending arranged marriage with a total stranger due to the failing health of his father.  The twist here is that the girl who he is supposed to marry is not from any royal or noble household.  She is just an average teenage schoolgirl whose parents are commoners  But the girls grandfather was apparently very good friends with the previous reigning king, before he became king, and had done him some great service, so they were the ones who arranged for the crown prince to marry the commoner's daughter when they were old enough.

The cultural class shock is what makes for a lot of funny, bitter and sweet moments throughout the film as the girl tries to adjust to ""upper crust"" royal society along with all the many social and etiquette requirements for a princess-to-be.  The hard part for the crown prince, Lee Shin, is that he is in love with another girl from a rich and noble family but she has dreams of being a world famous prima ballerina instead of just a ""showpiece"" as the consort/wife of the crown prince.  He does not want to deprive her of her dream so he accepts her refusal to marry him.

Meanwhile, the commoner girl who is not too keen on marrying a stranger, finally decides to go ahead with the engagement because her family is in dire financial straights and the engagement would insure that their financial obligations would be taken care of by the monarchy.

And though she knows this is all just a political arrangement, she finds herself starting to fall in love with the crown prince as time goes by. In the meantime the prince just tries to tolerate her and make the best of a difficult situation.  But he finds that as time goes by and he watches her efforts to fit in with his society and its requirements, that he is starting to develop feelings for her.

In the meantime, there is a back story with the 2nd prince, Lee Yul, who was the son of the original reigning king before he died unexpectedly in some type of traffic accident.  The dead king's younger brother ascended to the throne and that is how his son, Lee Shin, became the crown prince, displacing the 2nd prince who has returned from abroad and with his scheming mother is looking for a way to supplant the crown prince and become the ruling monarch instead.

Overall it's a great flight of fancy with beautiful sets and costumes as well as some very good acting.  A very enjoyable show overall.",1430611200,2,3007,4.609756097560975

4961456,3,B0065S7P04,"Love the show, but I disappointed on this videos format. I bought this to make sure it was for U.S. use and because it was cheaper than the other sellers that are selling the one named Palace for a 100.00 plus. But when I tested this out the picture comes up the size of a laptop screen. I bought the DVD so I could finally watch it in my big screen, but I guess not. Plus subtitles seem to be more made for American punch lines than the actual context translation. I'm keeping it though because I love the show and still don't feel like spending a 100 plus on the other, but you do get what you paid for. Which I find weird because I ordered other shoes from this buyer and they came out great, just not so much on this one.",1419897600,,725,4.041666666666667
4961457,3,B0065S7P04,"This story was sort of unrealistic.  Korean soap dramas often depict the childish, unrealistic  behavior of the lead actress for her age.  The Crown Prince's personality rang true because of his stoic upbringing.  The supporting cast was very well represented.",1413331200,,260,5.425
4961458,3,B0065S7P04,I had watched this drama a long time ago and really loved it and when I found it on dvd I was so excited. But as I began to watch it was really clear that the person who did the subs didn't have a grasp on how to translate the korean spoken language and put it into english subtitles that make sense to a native english speaker. I am not fluent in korean but I do know enough to be able to tell that the subtitles were off because the subs just didn't make sense at times.,1395705600,5,472,3.8762886597938144

4961461,3,B0065S7P04,"Slow for most of the first episode, but like all the other good dramas, the story, the acting, and the character development, sucks you in. I enjoyed the tom boyishness of the main actress and the romance that brewed between the characters. It had some suspense and mystery. I had fun watching it. The main drawback was the person/company who did the translations. I could tell they were not professionals. The subtitles were too quick to leave the screen, and in many of the scenes, they were omitted. Also, the grammar and spelling, were wrong in some places. The minor errors  can be overlooked since the drift of the conversation was understood. But to omit translations, this is thievery. I would have given this film more stars if the subtitles were up to par.",1373414400,5,766,4.7164179104477615

8493564,4,B0065S7P04,"In the cinematic universe of PRINCESS HOURS, the current division of Korea into two countries after World War II never happened. Korea has retained its monarchy under a constitutional basis much as Great Britain has done for centuries.  In this alternate universe, the monarchy is headed by a king and queen both of whom are decent sorts who value the tradition that a monarchy presents. But a problem arises that is the plot driver. Years before the current king became king, his brother the ruling king unexpectedly died making his younger brother king. This transition had a number of long lasting effects. The son of the late king was demoted while the son of the current king was promoted as the next in line for the throne. Further, plans were made for the demoted Crown Prince to marry a commoner. When the new Crown Prince was announced, it was he who would marry the commoner. Fourteen years pass before the Crown Prince meets the commoner and their meeting forms the serious-comedic impetus for the plot.

  Director In-Roe Hwang takes advantage of the fascination that modern day Korea has for its hallowed history of the Joseon Dynasty, which to Koreans is their version of our cowboy films. The Crown Prince Shin (Ji-hun Ju) is a quiet young high school senior who has long repressed the stresses of knowing that he was not the original choice to be the next king. He has a girlfriend he wishes to marry but he has orders to break up with her to marry a classmate whom he sees as a silly unsophisticated Chae-kyung Shin (Eyn hye Yun). This commoner is pictured as a fairly typical Korean valley girl whose knowledge of the world is limited to what she sees on Korean television. She speaks a popular form of Korean slang and is quite unremarkable. Chae-kyung learns of her betrothal to Shin and is forced by filial duty to accept her lot. She and Shin take an instant dislike to one another, and in the spirit of many Korean dramas, the focus is on the slow metamorphosis from dislike to like and later to love. Complicating matters is the re-appearance of the demoted former Crown Prince Yool (Sang Jung Kim) who falls in love with Chae-kyung and it is the bitter rivalry between Yool and Shin that drives much of the film.

  PRINCESS HOURS is a serio-comic dramatization of a behind the scenes peek at the personalities of a royal family, chief of which is a focus on the romantic triangle of Shin, Yool, and Chae-kyung. Shin would probably make a good king while Yool has emotional issues that would likely interfere with being king were he chosen one.  Chae-kyung is initially seen as a pseudo-royal fish out of water. She has neither talent not desire to learn the intricate subtleties to be a Crown Princess. She feels stifled by a inflexible code of royal accepted behavior. Chae-kyung seems an unlikely object of desire for Yool and Shin since she is continuously weeping, apologizing, and generally running afoul of royal protocol. Further there is a truly farcical moment in the twenty-four episode run that illustrates the puritanical thread connecting most Korean television dramas. The world of romantic K-dramas is not one where sexuality is permitted. In one truly cringe-worthy moment, on their wedding night, neither Shin nor Chae-kyung act as if they know nothing of connubial activities and both engage in calisthenics to dissipate physical urges. Still, the quality of acting and the realization that no one is truly born to be a monarch invests PRINCESS HOURS with a ongoing interest that makes it more than a passing entertainment.  One must work hard and suffer to achieve one's life goals. PRINCESS HOURS says this as well as any other film.",1443312000,,3679,4.790220820189274
