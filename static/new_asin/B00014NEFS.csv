8006340,5,B00014NEFS,"I have found this film to be very intriguing on many different levels.  In my own researches on the first chapter of Genesis I have found Dr. Paul LaViolette investigations to be quite complimentary to the Genesis texts.  These are things he is probably unaware of; owever, the galactic core is precisely as Dr. LaViolette has envisaged it between Scorpio and Sagittarius.  That was an astounding discovery on his part.  There are many other nuances that come out of his researches that compliment the Genesis text but the position of the galactic core was the most important in my eyes.

His hypothesis that the galaxy is periodically cleansed is in sync with the Genesis text and Carl G. Jung;s notion of the soul/psyche (Transcendent Function).  The sacred scriptures being a compendium of archetypal motifs of the soul/psyche.  The universe in turn is a mirror image of the soul/psyche.  This entire scenario regarding the wave from the galactic core is the basic outline of the entire Old and New Testaments on a symbolic level.  Here Dr. Paul LaViolette outlines that process, via his investigations, without all of the religious wording that goes with the Judeao Christian texts.",1306195200,,1186,5.010204081632653
8006341,4,B00014NEFS,"This is a fine companion to Dr. LaViolette's book by the same title.  Unlike much pseudoscience in vogue these days, this man's work represents a alternate explanation of the history of planet Earth that is based on sound scientific principles and solid research. It's not a feel-good product, but not necessarily alarmist, either.  I think LaViolette says somewhere that he's about 95% sure that a cosmic dust incursion will occur in the next 400 years. Even more interesting is his conviction that the ancient myths of bygone cultures, such as the Mayans and Egyptians, represent encoded warnings for future generations.  Truly provocative for the open-minded.",1278633600,,662,5.285714285714286
8006342,4,B00014NEFS,"This DVD presents some very interesting alternative theories.  Although I remain skeptical of some of the theories proposed withing (extraordinary theories require extraordinary evidence), it is well thought out, and the arguments are well presented.  I would be interested in knowing more about these theories, and any other evidence supporting them.",1184976000,7,351,5.862745098039215
