5454148,4,B00AMSQBP8,"Great value !! However, be aware, especially if you are a parent, that, in addition to the classic movies, the more recent Billy Bob Thornton remake is in this package. So basically, you get 3 ""G"" rated movies and one ""PG-13"" rated movie. This is no problem, unless you are buying it, as I did, for a 8 year old that loves baseball and baseball movies. No biggie, as I just removed that one from the package after receiving it since I didn't want him seeing that movie at his age. Otherwise, no issues and a great buy !!",1452038400,3,520,4.262626262626263

8554231,5,B00AMSQBP8,"This DVD pack is great! You can't beat the price for 4 disks! I love that it comes with 4 separate dvds instead of all 4 movies on 1 dvd. I have temporarily (hopefully only temporarily) lost my dvd remote so I cannot advance to other parts the dvd offers (special features, bonus scenes, etc.), so being that it comes with 4 dvds, I can watch all 4 movies. If all the movies were on 1 dvd, I would probably only be able to view the 1st movie listed. So, thank you for that! All 4 movies are great! The characters are awesome and do a super job. Many of you stated that your favorite version of The Bad News Bears is the original, but mine is the ""newer"" version with Billy Bob Thornton.  I love it!! They are all rated PG, except the Billy Bob Thornton version is PG-13. I recommend this product to all who enjoy comedy, kids, and/or baseball. ",1467331200,2,844,4.203703703703703
8554232,5,B00AMSQBP8,Received the DVDs and they were in perfect shape. Already watched them all and ready to start again!,1467244800,,100,4.611111111111111
8554233,4,B00AMSQBP8,"One of the best baseball movies. Its been quite a few years, but this movie is still a great watch. Back when it was made, you could let your kids watch it without fear you would somehow warp their little minds or have to send them to a shrink after watching it. Now, who knows? In todays pc world, parents may want to preview it 1st as there is some light cussing and even beer drinking shown.
Walter Matthau gives a great performance as the ""Bears"" coach. The supporting cast including the late Victor morrow fills out the movie nicely. This item includes all 4 bnb movies, but the original is what your really buying it for imo.",1465948800,2,631,4.3559322033898304
