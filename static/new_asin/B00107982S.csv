8237348,5,B00107982S,"On the surface, ""The Other Final"" is a way to satirize all the commercialism and hype surrounding the 2002 World Cup: instead of vying for the top prize, with all the power and glory - and product endorsements and lucrative player contracts - that goes with it, two teams set out to vie for the non-prize at the other end of the spectrum, hence the documentary's title. The two national teams competing in The Other Final are Bhutan, an isolated nation nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, and Montserrat, an isolated nation in the midst of the Caribbean Sea.

A funny thing happens along the way, though. Far, far away from the hype surrounding the final the rest of the world is watching, The Other Final's participants demonstrate what the sport is really all about: human beings from vastly different cultures coming together for a common purpose, which is their mutual love of football (or soccer, if you prefer). In the process, people from two nations that had never before heard of one another make friends. They have had less-than-stellar reputations on the pitch, but their interactions with one another are the very definition of true sportsmanship. It's a lesson some of their big-name counterparts should study more closely.

The difficulties that Johan Kramer and Matthijs de Jongh (who conceived the entire idea after seeing their native Netherlands team crash out of the World Cup in the early stages) encounter in getting the match to take place at all are extraordinary. First the Montserrat team's coach resigns on the same day the team agreed to participate in the other final. Then Bhutan's coach passes away. This would probably be enough to make most people abandon the entire idea; happily, this pair of Dutch filmmakers aren't most people. The Montserrat team makes it way to Bhutan, and after additional trials that alternately have the viewer chuckling and shaking the head in amazement, The Other Final does indeed take place.

There's no spoiler alert here - go watch the film if you want to know who won.  In the end, perhaps it really doesn't matter. This is a story that's more about the human beings who made it all happen, from the filmmakers  to the players we get to know and the cultures they come from. For that, and for this charming film they have graciously appeared in, they deserve football glory.",1276732800,5,2339,4.852130325814536
