8362663,5,B002C018U2,"This set contains five movies aired on Masterpiece Theatre that were originally broadcoast by the BBC. All of the movies were adapted from Minnete Walter books: (1) The Echo; (2) The Dark Room; (3) The Ice House; (4) The Scold's Bridle and (5)The Sculptress. Each story is worth viewing and reading.

THE ECHO: Clive Owens stars as a hard boiled reporter order to investigate an apparent suicide by a homeless man in the garage of a infamous widow (Joely Richardson). The sexual undercurrents between these two are fascinating to watch. In fact, the whole movie is fascinating to watch. There is the usual plot twists and interesting characters that one expects from Minette Walters and it translates well to screen as directed by Diarmuid Lawrence. The whole who-did-it suspense is nicely done as we meet likely suspects (loner co-worker, missing husband who tries to make amends?, street kid, etc.) while the plot revelas further unsolved mysteries......

THE DARK ROOM: A young woman wakes up after a serious car accident and cannot remember what just happened - which makes it difficult for the police when they want to question her on the recent discovery of her dead ex-fiance and former maid of honor. A pyschistrist has been hired to help her by her shady father but is he really there to help? and what really happened just before her accident?

THE ICE HOUSE: The body of a man is discovered in the Ice House - is it the widow's missing husband? The inspector thinks so and looks to finally get a guilty verdict after 15 years plus. The years have not been kind the widow as the village has deemed her guilty anyway and the addition of two femists (lesbians?) to her household have not endeared her to them. Who is the man and what other secret will be unburied?

THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE: An older woman of means dies wearing a scold's bridle - a demeaning devise that was worn by choice. A story of how the abused in turn abuse.....

THE SCULPTRESS: An unattrative young woman admits to killing her mother & pretty sister. The grisly and confusing scene still haunts the officer first on sight and when years later an author tries to prove her innocence for a book she is writing, things only get more confusing.",1328745600,4,2218,4.706185567010309
8362664,4,B002C018U2,"On ""The Ice House"", an Australian-produced DVD:

Of a rich widow-  her early family-vinery-owning husband who had an underage daughter raped on his disappearing as-good-bye-family-gesture,-  sharing (for money) her castle with a same gender attracted female couple accomodating her round a clock, and police taking advantage from women suspected as cottage residents were drinking and wondering at the nothing-done-with-the-money-bag-widowed killer-all-smelt, the story is of relatively modern England (no cell phones-so, it is the beginning of the eighties of the twentieth century, no later) where garden ice houses in family forests have as understood habitually been used for a sex and hiding corpses as a body was done even in Sandringham these days.

Eventually, a very realistic depiction of the UK boring feudalistic reality where even clever and loyal HMS detectives are screened barely distinctive from those they were chasing for.

On The Scold's Bridle

A story dismantles a generational pitiful incest/sadomasochism-inclined existence of a nothing-more-to-worry-about upper-class family of a feudalistic society while commoners surrounding just complicated police investigating a string of clan's crimes following.

Probably, emphasising crimes on the Freud theory makes Minette Walters works less known worldwide than ones by Agatha Christie grounding her criminology on simple materialistic reasons more acceptable internationally.",1326326400,,1446,6.093596059113301
8362665,5,B002C018U2,"It states VERY CLEARLY in the title above that this is a NON-US FORMAT DVD. And the product information states this as well and says you need a Multi-Region DVD player. So, I don't know what this critic above is talking about. Read the information given and you wouldn't have a problem.

Excellent adaptations of Minette Walters books.",1294012800,4,335,4.775862068965517
8362666,1,B002C018U2,I would not buy this product from any of the Amazon merchants listed because you can't play it in the US.  So what's the point of selling it in the US?  I bought it and had a heck of a time returning it and merchant never did credit my account as he was supposed to but my credit card did.  Never again trust an Amazon merchants' information.  When I bought the product it was not listed as a non-US product.  Have fun with that DaVeeDa - he/she.,1270512000,,446,4.080459770114943
