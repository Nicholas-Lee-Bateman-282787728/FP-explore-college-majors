8309358,3,B001HOFVC0,"Very enjoyable movie to watch with the entire family. I was hoping that the kittens would be smaller similar to Dempsey's work in Cute Kittens (2003) but I can't complain. I was trying to find the soundtrack online, just couldn't get enough of it. I'm still giggling from the Homewreckers scene. I love cats!",1386547200,,308,4.722222222222222
8309359,1,B001HOFVC0,"This video used repeats of kittens actions and just titles it differently.  very boring to watch.
the background music is totally irritating.
threw this away instead of passing it on.",1379289600,,183,5.1
8309360,4,B001HOFVC0,"""Off the scale"" cute, but the only reasons I didn't give it five stars is because (1) the video is produced in short bursts.  The longest continuous filming scene is probably ten seconds, with most much shorter (that makes it sort of jumpy), and (2) the audio is ""non-descript"" music, not really unpleasant to listen to, but certainly not pleasant.  The first scene with ""Molly, Chews a Thing"" shown on the cover, is nice, as all the other kittens.  I DO LIKE IT, but it could have been better.",1284768000,2,494,4.52808988764045
