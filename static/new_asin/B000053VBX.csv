7930285,1,B000053VBX,"I've got to at least take a look at any movie about Las Vegas, but this had all the warning signs of being bad from the get go.  You've got a lady on the box holding a shotgun across the back of her neck.  She's wearing a red business suit (funny, but it's blue in the movie), which is slit all the way up to the hip.  There's a Brad-Pitt look-alike also inset on the poster.  So it makes no bones about what kind of movie it is, and I should have been warned.
It's as bad as it looks.  The lady is a lawyer, and is on the run because the two dumbest hit men in the world seem to be following her through the California and Nevada desert.  Seems she's a lawyer, which of course explains why her business suit is cut so high.  She becomes aware of some information about some South American deforestation, and this makes her the target of a hit so the nasty deal can go through.
Along the way, she picks up, first as a hostage, then as a partner, someone the production team needs to look exactly like Brad Pitt from ""Kalifornia"".  Their adventures result in not only multiple shootouts, but more and more of that blue business suit getting shredded.  Every time she is running, which is a lot, something gets unfastened, in a very calculated manner, as it never gets unfastened as much as we'd like to see it.  The Pitt clone notices this, and even though they are running for their lives, there is still time for a quick boink.  We see what is probably a stunt breast, as it and her face are never in the same shot.  But hey, if they can do this with Julia Roberts, why not this movie?
One more quick note on authentication.  The desert roads around Nevada are certainly the real thing, although I have no idea where they got the ""Star Wars"" sand dunes at the beginning.  But when our heroes finally get to Vegas, they try make it seem as if they are driving down Fremont Street, the heart of downtown.  The movie was made in 2000, and Fremont Street has been closed to traffic for years now.  It's that kind of movie.",1045872000,5,2019,4.2323759791122715
