8390776,5,B0037U62G6,"This is an easy to follow program that will work well for complete exercise beginners up to intermediate. Even if you have never worked out before this program provides a balanced workout routine and all the instruction you need to do the workouts safely and effectively. You can do the whole program in your home as the only equipment required is a resistance band or set of dumbbells and some decent cardio shoes.

If you follow the program guide you'll be doing 3 days of cardio and abdominal exercises and 3 days of strength training each week as well as stretching before and after each workout. The workouts are offered at two levels of difficulty: 1-2 for beginners and 3-4 if you're already in decent shape or have worked your way up from the 1-2 routines.

Here's what I like about this program:

1) I honestly believe the Level 1-2 program is doable by anyone, even the very out of shape, very heavy or those with very little time for working out. One problem people have when they're trying to get in shape is overdoing it and getting so sore they have difficulty getting through all the workouts they planned to do that week. I really feel that the 1-2 workouts are paced exactly right to allow anyone to follow the program and work out 6 days a week. Tony and his two assistants do the workout with you and show you modifications you can use if you're struggling. And each workout is less than 45 minutes from start to finish so you CAN fit it into your schedule.

2) You don't need a lot of expensive equipment to do this program. The cardio/ab workout doesn't require any equipment other than your shoes and the strength training workout can be done with just a resistance band. (great for keeping up with your workout while traveling too). You can also use a set of dumb bells if you prefer it. During the strength workout, Tony and one assistant use dumb bells and the second assistant demonstrates how to use the resistance band so either way you have the instruction you need to do the exercises correctly.

3) The program is balanced - it incorporates cardio, strength training, flexibilty and abs instead of just cardio or just strength training and no stretching like some other programs I've seen.

4) The program is easy to follow. Just pop in the video and follow along. Tony and his assistants work out with you as well as provide verbal instruction so even complete beginners can perform the workout correctly. There is also a short written guide included that explains how to do the program and gives diet recommendations.

5) Once the 1-2 workouts aren't challenging any more you can move up to the 3-4 workouts which are similar to 1-2 but are a little longer. You will still complete your workout and stretching in less than 50 minutes and you don't need any new equipment.",1368576000,,2804,4.596
