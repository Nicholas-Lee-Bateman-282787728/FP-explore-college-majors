8023612,1,B00028G54A,"I can't remember which seller did I get this movie from, but the english translation is lousy and very poor, not worth watching and even worse, buying. I wish I could return it, it's terribly bad. The french version would've been much better. Somebody did screwed this movie.",1422662400,2,275,4.75
8023613,1,B00028G54A,"Stay as far away from this DVD release as you can.  This is a 4x3 Black & White lousy copy of a beautiful 16x9 film from 1970. It has been released in glorious color in Europe, so why do we get this piece of junk?

I think the answer is incompetent distributors that don't give a darn, and will do anything for a profit, even release this trashy DVD that was obviously recorded from analog television onto VHS tape. This product should be immediately pulled from distribution. I have sent a letter stating such to KOCH entertainment. No answer...  I guess for these people there is no shame.",1300320000,5,591,4.453703703703703
8023614,1,B00028G54A,"This may be a good movie but one's enjoyment of it is destroyed by the transfer. I don't know about the USA but Britain has consumer protection laws as does Australia & Canada. Dvds of such appalling quality as this should not be allowed to be sold. This is worse than the worst pirated videos I've seen. I'm not blaming Amazon, but why isn't this Koch transfer in the same legal class as pirated videos? People shouldn't be allowed to charge people for such a product. I haven't seen such terrible video resolution since 1st generation mobile phone videos! I'm binning my copy as I wouldn't inflict in on anyone else",1269907200,3,617,4.5675675675675675
8023615,3,B00028G54A,"I've got a copy of the French DVD release of this film.  The color is gorgeous--bright and rich--and the aspect ratio is shown in its correct wide-screen format.  It looks and sounds great. But there are no English subtitles.  I don't know French but having seen the absolutely horrible b/w dubbed version others describe here (and they describe it correctly) I knew the plot and was somewhat familiar with the dialogue.  I'm surprised someone hasn't taken the French release and provide it with subtitles.

I give the b/w dubbed release a three-star rating because the plot is fun and the interaction between the characters shows Brigitte at her best onscreen.",1245369600,3,661,4.972727272727273
8023616,3,B00028G54A,"Yes this movie should be in color. It is a lousy transfer, It does have Miss Bardot driving a late 60's Vette! Does anyone know who the band is that is playing when B.B. first appears on screen? Sounds like mod era London for sure!",1234656000,,231,4.155555555555556
8023617,3,B00028G54A,"Cute film, lousy transfer.

Hey, shouldn't this film be in color?  After all, it was made in '69!",1131753600,5,97,4.333333333333333
8023618,2,B00028G54A,"If you see a well shot and edited movie made 60 years ago chances are it will still look better than this one. The colour has somehow got lost on the DVD transfer, the sound is scratchy in places and murdered by bad dubbing (particularly with the little boy) and an intrusive musical score drowns out the dialogue. Having said that, although the plot is very thin, Bardot is a true professional and squeezes evrything she can out of her character. Its silly and not terribly funny either and  probably not worth playing again for a very long time , but even with so much against it, the Star DOES shine through. She is a megastar and her screen presence can not be denied. If you're a fan buy it anyway. If your new to Brigitte's charms, get ""Une Parisienne"" , ""Come Dance with me"" and ""And God created woman"" before you even think of this one.",1100390400,14,844,4.375796178343949
8023619,2,B00028G54A,"Well, I'm not going to go into the content of this movie - if you are reading this review you must be familiar with Bardot movies of this period and must know the quality of her work at this time.  On the plus side, she looks absolutely gorgeous.....and that's about it.  This DVD has to be the worst transfer of a movie to a DVD I have ever seen.  It's in Black and White - full frame - dubbed terribly, and is rather grainy and unclear as well.  Basically, I'm wishing that I had purchased the VHS edition which according to the other review of the item is at least in some kind of colour, albeit with a green tint to it.  Avoid unless you are a completeist.",1097107200,13,660,4.125
