1996142,2,B0001FVDXM,"Nobody else but George Marshall with his characteristic knack for comedy could have helmed the 1940 western horse opera ""When the Daltons Rode.""  This entertaining but uneven blend of humor and hell-raising in what constitutes a biography of the Dalton gang boasts top-flight stunt work but a lightweight approach to an inherently tragic sub-genre within westerns--the outlaw opus.  When Universal Studios released this movie, the Hays Office dictated that criminals must not profit from their perfidy, and these felons had to be punished for their anti-social misdeeds.  Marshall and scenarist Harold Shumate present the Daltons initially as victims of a crooked land grabbing scheme before they embark on a life of lawlessness made all the more ironic since Bob was a lawman.  Indeed, by fade-out, the Daltons have traveled the entire trajectory from maligned innocents to hardened outlaws.  Nevertheless, the filmmakers do everything in their power to make this outlaw opus palatable rather than oppressive.  Unfortunately, neither director nor writer delves too deeply into the land grabber scheme and the revelation of the individual--the Judas if you will--behind their woes is dealt with in formulaic fashion.  The Daltons never learn his identity, but Bob deals him a death blow.  Long before ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" treated its infamous outlaw pair with levity, Marshall did so with the Daltons in this trim 81 minute release.  For the record, Marshall had made more than his share of westerns during the silent film era, so he was no stranger to westerns.  Furthermore, Marshall became the first major western director to ridicule the conventions of the western.  ""Destry Rides Again,"" which he made before ""When the Daltons Rode"" at Universal, stands western conventions on their heads.  Sadly, ""When the Daltons Rode"" isn't as good as either ""Destry Rides Again"" or Marshall's next western ""Texas.""  The other major weakness of ""When the Daltons Rode"" is casting leading man Randolph Scott as a tin-horn attorney who never palms a six-gun and spends too much time off screen while supporting players Broderick Crawford, Brian Donlevy, and Andy Devine get the lion's share of the action.

Marshall stages several great action scenes riddled with comedy.  The Daltons make a daring, daylight escape from one town when Ozark hijacks a stagecoach and provides cover for their departure from a besieged dinner is funny.  Stunt pioneer Yakima Canutt performs his landmark ""Stagecoach"" stunt.  The next great action scene occurs on a train filled with lawmen.  Our antagonists steal their horses and ride away.  ""When the Daltons Rode"" has enough action and comedy to help compensate for its tragic ending.  The last scene with Tod enduring another lecture from Edgar Buchanan's grizzled old blacksmith is a hoot.

There are no special features, but the print of this film is excellent.",1197158400,10,2904,5.2559652928416485
1996143,4,B0001FVDXM,"Universal Pictures presents ""WHEN THE DALTONS RODE"" (1940) (81 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring Randolph Scott, Kay Francis, Brian Donlevy, George Bancroft & Broderick Crawford --- Directed by George Marshall and released in February 1, 1941, our story line and film, Young lawyer Tod Jackson arrives in pioneer Kansas to visit his prosperous rancher friends the Daltons, just as the latter are in danger of losing their land to a crooked development company. When Tod tries to help them, a faked murder charge turns the Daltons into outlaws. Tod is now torn between staying loyal to his friends and upholding the law. Falling in love with Bob Dalton's former fiance Julie, also complicates his predicament --- A rattling good story with a non-stop marathon of action in the final quarter --- The real star is Broderick Crawford who despite his New York Bronx accent, really shines here as the lead Dalton, even scene-stealing away from Brian Donlevy who takes a back seat. This film is Crawford's show, no question about it --- Enjoy the expert pacing emphasis and the humor - the lynch mob bursting into the jail to find the whole gang waiting for them, guns drawn, is classic --- take note the film also has one of the best filmings of the Yak Canutt routine of falling under a runaway coach of horses --- A class act, if you want 40s action that moves along pretty nicely, then you can't go wrong here.

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959), ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

1996144,2,B0001FVDXM,"Occasionally, Hollywood will put someone in a picture and give them top billing even though their performance basically amounts to a cameo role.

Such is the case for the great Randolph Scott, who finds himself the titular star of When The Daltons Rode when he's not on the screen much at all. And for that, he should have felt fortunate, because this is not a good movie.

And it's not because it's grossly inaccurate, although that's true (the Dalton's have a saintly Irish mother. They basically got into a life of crime because they were forced into it, etc.) If someone wants accurate history, they should read and study it on their own, and not expect Hollywood to get it right because they usually don't get it right. But this film is just not entertaining. Brian Donlevy and crew just don't make the Daltons that interesting or appealing and Scott's performance as their lawyer doesn't justify his appearance in the film.

To sum everything up, this film is not an example of a classic Hollywood Western.",1175558400,3,1012,4.738636363636363
1996145,1,B0001FVDXM,"I am not going to be kind to this movie, mostly because the great Randolph Scott is utterly wasted as the lawyer family friend who steals Bob Dalton's girl. The first 20 minutes are slow enough to put you to sleep, but then the action kicks in. The action is ruined by too much comedy relief, in the character ""Ozark,"" who renders what should be serious material into a one-man vaudeville act.

In it's defense, the movie does have some good action scenes, but overall they are depicted so unrealistically and campy that these small benefits are lost. It's a shame, because the movie had the potential to exploit the Dalton legend and deliver a noteworthy film. Instead, the end result is a wacky, schizophrenic yuk-fest complimented by some furious action sequences and forgettable dialogue.

For a better movie in the ""Universal Western"" series, try ""No Name On The Bullett,"" ""Whispering Smith,"" or any of the three recent Jimmy Stewart/Anthony Mann releases.",1105920000,4,961,4.925925925925926
1996146,4,B0001FVDXM,"If one is expecting a historical piece on the Dalton gang, this is not it. Though based on a story written by Emmett Dalton, this western is pure B-Hollywood despite the presence of Randolph Scott, a cowbay star a notch above the B western heroes. This is a light western where one should just sit back and enjoy. Andy Devine and an uncreditted Edgar Buchanan are pure delight. Broderick Crawford's fast talking style is typical Highway Patrol of the 50's. This was released many years before All the King's Men and Crawford's star quality is already very evident. It took along time coming (for the re-issue in DVD)so savor this one to the fullest.",1093219200,12,649,4.701754385964913

When the Daltons Rode is a superior little western, and this release, by Universal, is very much welcomed. Although this movie has been available in several variable, generally poor video releases in the past, to finally have it on DVD, presumably well mastered by Universal engineers, will be a delight.

In silent era and 1930s Hollywood, the western was a sure bet to turn a profit, thus so-called Poverty Row studios favored such ""good guy-bad guy"" stories. What after all could be easier and more inexpensive than having a camera crew drive a few miles so they could film riders and horses galloping around a local park or ranch?

And that seems to be the extent of so many low budget western programmers that have survived since the '30s: crowds of anonymous horsemen dashing to camera left or right, and in rare cases seeming to come right at the viewer even as they retreat in a cloud of dust into the rural California landscape. Stirring music blares, hooves clatter and it's all rather tedious.

The larger studios, from REPUBLIC and UNIVERSAL right up to the few corporate giants, had units dedicated to turning out westerns. The results were frequently 'B' films with top notch casts that were very entertaining. WHEN THE DALTONS RODE (1940) is a prime example of this type product. Yes the story's fiction, but isn't that true of most western lore? It's loosely based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emmett-Dalton-s-book-of-the-same-name/dp/1455615358/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emmett Dalton's book of the same name</a>, which has also been criticized as being none too accurate.

Director George Marshall's film doesn't give any sense of how large this family really was. There were a dozen Dalton siblings, but only a few were outlaws. In the movie, Ben Dalton, played by Stuart Erwin, is a farmer who's murdered in front of a crowd of townspeople. The real Ben was in his 80s when he died in 1936. Also at story's end we see a photo studio memorial to four dead Daltons, including Emmett, who supposedly perished after a botched bank robbery. (Awfully tough to write a book when you're daisy-pushing in Boot Hill.)

So is WHEN THE DALTONS RODE worth seeing? In two words: absolutely YES, as long as you're not expecting a history lesson. It's a vigorous, always entertaining movie that has touches of humor, a romantic triangle subplot, lots of action (including a mob riot), viliains everywhere, an actual ""Great Train Robbery"" sequence, and of course a shootout on a dusty Kansas street where the Dalton gang passed from life into legend.

Highly recommended!

1996162,3,B0001FVDXM,"This 1940 black and white effort is I suppose solidly in the ""b"" western category, though Scott had proven his star value in the previous year's JESSE JAMES and would go on to make perhaps his best film of the decade just after this one, Fritz Lang's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Western-Union-VHS/dp/630152859X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Western Union [VHS</a>].  In addition to Scott it's got Brian Donlevy, an Oscar nominee the previous year for BEAU GESTE, and Broderick Crawford who had also appeared in that film and would go on to win a statue a few years later. The cast on the whole is fine, Donlevy especially, the stuntwork in particular is terrific, and there are some fairly exciting action sequences, but it doesn't all add up to much and I think in this case it's those behind the camera who are probably most at fault. Director George Marshall was one of the most prolific in Hollywood, but he seems to be a workmanlike guy who did the job without putting too much personality into things; here the combination of humor and a pretty serious subject might have made for something a lot more interesting with director and screenplay (by Harold Shumate, based on a book cowritten by the one surviving real-life Dalton brother Emmett) that were more sensitive and subtle.

The film describes the turning to crime of the Dalton brothers in 1890 Kansas, and the struggles that their lawyer friend Tod Jackson (Scott) has in first trying to help them keep their land, and then trying to keep them from getting hunted down and shot or hanged. It starts out with Jackson riding into town to say hello to his old childhood friends the Dalton brothers. He's on his way to a bigger town but decides to stay to help out his pals and others in forming a grange to have legal standing against land grabbers - and to romance Julie (Kay Francis) who is affianced to Bob Dalton (Crawford) but quickly takes a shine to Jackson. I think the early parts blending humor, romance and community in a style reminiscent of Ford are probably the best, but the film turns formulaic and obvious when the Daltons accidentally kill a man and quickly descend into outlawdom.

From there on it's bank robberies, stagecoach chases and railroad holdups as the boys struggle to keep ahead of the law and at the same time to get their property back from the dishonest speculator whose identity is all too obvious when revealed. Meanwhile Scott and Francis are pretty much relegated to the sidelines, their future way out of the mess as obvious as the brothers' tragic end is inevitable. There was some potential to really get into the whole ""why good men go bad"" theme, but it's never really exploited at all and the brothers are unrecognizably brutal and vicious at the end without it ever seeming realistic that they could sink so low, so quickly.

As I said above, the stuntwork - in particular an impressive stagecoach sequence where one of the brothers slides under the coach to the back and climbs up it (nope, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK wasn't the first to do this) and the gunfights are well done, and in common with most lower-budget westerns of the day it's over quickly enough that one doesn't get too bored. But this is really only for serious aficionados of the star or genre, and needless to say it's accuracy is highly doubtful in almost every area. There's a cute, nearly identical pair of sequences involving the taciturn Scott trying to get quick answers out of the loquacious Edgar Buchanan which works well; some of the interior humor involving Andy Devine as Dalton confederate Ozark is a little much, though.

No extras to speak of on this acceptable Universal DVD.  I'm enough of a Scott fan that this was worth a look for me, though I doubt I'll return to it often.",1265328000,,3811,4.801829268292683
