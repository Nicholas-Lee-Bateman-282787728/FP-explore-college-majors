4412491,2,B004LWZW7E,"So I was watching this movie, the trailer gave me high hopes because the whole general idea of using time as the future currency is actually interesting because as we all know it, time is money. So this movie is an interpretation of that phrase. Now the two main actors of the movie shown in the cover art (Justin Timberlake) as Will Salas and (Amanda Seyfield) as Sylvia Weis are decent actors, but that's about as far as it'll go. Just enough to move the movie along but nothing beyond that.

Anyhow, I'll just go straight to the point. The movie was interesting, but throughout the movie, there was a lingering sensation of regret. One of the biggest hint of a failing movie that I seem to be getting more and more often which signifies a decaying American movie industry is the ever nagging thought ""this had so much potential"" , ""this movie could have been really great if..."" , ""what a waste of such an interesting subject for a movie..."".

To me, if the viewer, in this case myself, feels this way throughout the movie, it just means the movie is lacking. Enough for me to not consider a rewatch ever again. The cleverness of time is money and money is time ends right where the period ends this sentence. The acting wasn't great, the movie felt a bit rushed, the story was weak and felt emotionless. So much potential in drama and action, but cut severely short, crippling the movie. This is an OK watch, but not worth the theater ticket price.

1-10, I give this a 5.6
It's not a HORRIFIC movie since there's no unsubtle movie crippling flaws. It's entertaining, but only if you have nothing of higher quality to watch.",1323129600,5,1628,4.511864406779661
4412492,5,B004LWZW7E,"It is an excellent show. If you like shows like Matrix 2, you will like this.

This is going to be a slightly ""weird"" review. I am not going to comment on how the characters have acted or how their lives flowed in the ""new world order"" they were in. You can read those in other reviews or just watch this nice movie yourself to find out.

I find the show's ""new world order"" intriguing and will comment more on that.

GENERAL CONTEXT
The show portrayed a ""new world order"" where people are genetically engineered to stop aging once they reached 25 years. From there you must earn every seconds or year of your living and the entire economy is transacted using time as cash. The world was split into different zones.

Those who are rich with time (i.e. ""cash"") are in the same zone, while those who are poor were grouped in the ghetto zone. Those in the ghetto zone were the labourers producing things and living from day-to-day, if not seconds-to-seconds. Once you have run out of time, you died.

As time became the transactional medium, those without enough time would never get to enjoy the fruits of the labour they have produced. Its most likely beyond their reach as the fruits were too expensive (sounds familiar?). In any case, the labourers died as they have ran out of time.

You see in this show, the price of basic necessities kept inflating and hence more and more time were used to pay the bills, while the time wages (esp in the ghetto) either remained static or were reduced.

The show had a mantle: ""For a few to remain immortal, many must die. So in this case, it triggered one to think, ""For few to live well, others must die"" due to the scarcity of resources.

THOUGHTS ON PLOT
Granted that Immortality is what everyone craves for. As stated above, the show took on the genetically engineered future where Immortality was achieved.

From there the prescient plot mashed well on the ""new world order"" of immortality that functioned in the instinctive Darwinism of humans where it kept quoting ""Survival of the fittest"" (In my view, it's the ""Survival of the smartest""), and alongside the competitive nature of Capitalism in us, under an environment with scarce resources.

It tackled well how were people going to die, given that the limited world resources cannot support an immortal world where the population could expand infinitely (without death).

With the introduction of time as a transactional currency, and inflation lurking to ""kill of the poorer population"" by inflating them to run out of time, it resulted in a working capitalism system which naturally climaxed on the loop-sided case where the winners took all (the time) and achieved the rights to immortality.

From this, it gave Death a positive spin and showed a meaning in the greater cycle of things. Through death, one was able to make way for others (with changes coming about) and through death, one can better treasured one's time on earth to accomplish something. To quote from the show ""Why do it now, when you can do it a hundred years later"".

Every systems functioning in the name of Capitalism probably needed a reset when the winners were too well established, for the purest and rawest form of capitalism to return. That was where the revolution (and our hero) came in with the ""fight club"" moment to overthrow/reset the Order.

To wrap up, I now touch on abit on other aspects of the show. The 2 lead characters of the show. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried have chemistry as a couple. Both looked and acted well, as do the rest of the cast. And truly, kudos to Justin for taking on this project. If only the marketing for this show had been better, it may reach the status of zen-like show like Matrix.

If I may say, it's a sci-fi cult. I don't normally give 5 stars because I believe there's always much rooms for improvement. But for this show, in terms of how the refreshing plot and the characters comes about, I think a full 5 stars.

Can't wait to buy the DVD and see the extras in it.

MINI SPOILER
This scene somehow stood out. Will Salas's (Justin Timeberlake) mum Rachael Salas (played by Olivia Wilde) was having her 50th birthday. But as Will cannot even afford the time go eat a decent breakfast, his mum transferred 30 minutes to have his breakfast.

Later in the evening she went to the bank to pay 2 days time worth of loan. She was planning to take a bus from the bank to meet Will for a birthday dinner after the loan payment. But she only had 1.5 hours of time left in her life, while the bus ride inflated from 1 hour to 2 hour.

She couldn't afford the ride and could only run to the dinning place. When Will (flushed with time at that point) didn't meet her at the stipulated time, he ran towards the bank's direction to find her. Will's mum life expired in a matter of seconds before Will could reach her and transfer time to extend her life. She died in his arm.

It stuck in my mind that in stark contrast, the 30 minutes that Will's mum gave him in the morning may have ultimately cost her life in the cut-throat inflationary environment they were in.",1322352000,5,5102,4.520086862106406
4412493,2,B004LWZW7E,"Andrew Niccol's In Time is one of those films that ""could have, should have"" been good but for some reason wasn't. It had an intriguing concept at its core - a future society in which time is literally money and going broke brings new meaning to the term 'sudden death'. And it had a very talented screenwriter and director at the helm, Andrew Niccol, who has done great work with similar ideas before, as the screenwriter behind Gattaca, The Truman Show, S1m0ne and The Terminal, and as director in the case of Gattaca and S1m0ne. But what made these earlier films work - the art of creating a different reality and making it believable through the characters and the attention to detail in the world-building - is unfortunately sadly missing here.

The premise - the one that had such promise - is a future in which people have been genetically engineered to stop aging at 25.  The day you turn 25, your internal clock - bioengineered to display in the form of a glowing digital string of numbers along your inner forearm - begins ticking, starting with one year of time remaining. And that number is more than just how much time you have left, because time is now the currency everyone uses.  Everything costs - food, rent, bus fare, even a cup of coffee - and you pay for it with your time. And it's up to you to earn more time, because if your clock ever zeroes out, you're dead - suddenly, quickly and finally. So you're always working against the clock for more time, and you do anything to get it. If your job doesn't give you enough, then you beg, borrow or steal to get more. Anything to keep from running out. Rich people don't have to worry; barring death by accident, they have the potential to live forever. But anyone else...

Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a working-class guy who, like most people, lives day to day - literally. Through an unexpected turn of events, he is suddenly given a century of time - an unimagineable amount for someone at his level and something that attracts the unwanted attention of one of the system's enforcers, a Timekeeper named Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy in a riveting performance).  Things become further complicated when Will hooks up with Sylvia Weiss (Amanda Seyfried), the spoiled daughter of one of the system's richest men, Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). Both Will and Sylvia end up on the run from Raymond and from a local gang who wants all of the time this pair is running around with.

As I said, an intriguing premise and a potentially interesting plot. But sadly, the film fails to rise to the occasion. The problems are myriad, but believability is at the top of the list. Except for a handful of devices - like the glowing digital read-outs on everyone's arms and the way time has replaced money with meters that add to or deduct from your time, this world is - particularly visually - indistinguishable from our own. You get the impression that it should be in the future, especially since the film indicates that the system has been in place for at least a century, but nothing about the look of the film reflects that. Not the clothes or the cars or the buildings or anything else. Nothing in the details backs up what you're supposed to believe. Even more problematic are the people; we're _told_ how everything is different but we're almost never _shown_ that things are different.  Not in the way that matters.  The stilted dialogue and staged scenes have all the emotional impact of an infomercial.  Nothing about the way these characters act makes you really believe that most of them are living in a reality where each day is a desperate chance to earn another day.

A large part of the fault for this lies in the weak script. In addition to being riddled with banal dialogue, plotholes and dangling plot threads that get introduced and then completely abandoned, the script utterly fails to make the characters' actions believable. This stands in sharp contrast to the kind of scriptwork that Niccol did in both The Truman Show and Gattaca where the story flowed seamlessly and the characters were developed in such a way that all of their actions made sense. In Time, however, requires frequent suspensions of disbelief as the actions of most of the characters frequently make no sense at all. They do what they do because the plot requires it, not because it's what we feel their characters instinctively would do.  Again, given his past excellent work in script-writing, Niccol's failure here is simply inexplicable.

Oh, and on a side note, there's apparently a problem with the origins of the core story idea. Apparently many of the details seem to be drawn from Harlan Ellison's award-winning 1965 story ""'Repent, Harlequin', said the Ticktockman"", for which he was not given credit and over which he has sued the production company.

Another big problem is in the casting, both in terms of the look of the film and in the quality of the performances.  With regard to the first point, given the underlying premise - that everyone is supposed to stop aging at 25 - it's rather critical to the film's believability that the people in it actually _look_ like they stopped aging at 25. But this is rather hard to pull off when most of the actors, particularly in the key roles, are visibly older than that. In point of fact, only two actors in major roles who are the ages needed are Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia), who's 25, and Alex Pettyfer (Fortis, the gang's leader) who's 21. The rest are all noticably older. Justin Timberlake (Will) is 30. Cillian Murphy (the Timekeeper) is 35. Matt Bomer (the stranger who gives Will the gift of a century) is 34. Johnny Galecki (Borel, Will's best friend) is 36. And Vincent Kartheiser (Sylvia's mega-rich father) is 32. All of which make it even harder to believe in the reality of this alternate future which doesn't look like the future to begin with.

With regard to the quality of the performances, while most of the actors involved could be described as adequate, the performances vary between the painfully stilted (Timberlake) and the hopelessly bland (everyone else). I place the blame for most of this at the feet of Niccol as director and screenwriter. It is to Cillian Murphy's credit as an actor that he manages to rise above the problems of the weak script and the haphazard direction to give a truly memorable performance, turning what could have been a bland and cliched role into a riveting presence that dominates every scene he's in. Murphy's Timekeeper is a futuristic Javert, an unbending and relentless enforcer of the law whose integrity is grounded in a firm belief in the rightness of the system and of his role in it. When he's on the screen, the film comes alive around him. When he's not, it just drifts and careens from one pointless and reason-defying sequence to the next.

In retrospect, I'd say that Murphy delivers two reasons (besides a memorable performance) that someone might want to actually see this film. If you want to know the difference between a celebrity (Timberlake) and a real actor (Murphy) and why that difference matters, this film is a perfect example. And if you want to see what a skilled and committed actor can do even when handed a lame script and a director who seemingly has gone absent from the set, Murphy's Timekeeper really sets the bar.

Except for the core idea and for Cillian Murphy's performance, not really recommended unless you can watch it for free and have nothing else better to do with your time.",1321056000,8,7496,4.714285714285714
4412494,4,B004LWZW7E,"In Time is a retro-sci-fi period piece that uses a dystopian setting to make a political point.  Depending on your willingness to listen to the polemic that one's wealth is directly tied to one's longevity will determine how much you enjoy the film.

That one point - money is life - is key to In Time's premise, and it's the cost of entry to watch what amounts to Bonnie and Clyde meets Logan's Run. In this non-future, everyone ages to 25 and then begins paying their dues in seconds off their remaining life, a form of population birth control.  The good news is that they will be young and beautiful for the rest of your days; the bad news is that only the rich can afford to be immortal.

And that's at the crux of In Time.  Is it better to live a short, exciting life or an eternally long safe one? On the brutal and short side is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), his hottie mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde), and his best friend Borel (Johnny Galecki). In Time playfully teases us by openly embracing a common movie foible: mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives all look young and beautiful.  The intimate moments between mother and son are uncomfortable for the audience because we can't help but ogle Will's 50-year-old mom.

The flip side features the very rich and suicidal Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), over a century old and bored to death. When Salas saves Hamilton's life from Minutemen mobster Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), he bestows a century on him with a flick of a wrist.  In this universe, everyone's time counts down on their forearm and it can be given or taken by whoever ""has the upper hand"" - two forearms touching exchanges time to the arm on top.

See what I just did there? It's impossible to avoid the use of clich&eacute;s in reviewing this film because the script's dialogue gleefully embraces the absurdity of it all. From ""cleaning clocks"" (killing people) to ""keeping time"" (policing citizens), no ironic turn of phrase goes unspoken.  Speaking of keeping time, the only law of consequence are the Timekeepers, led by veteran Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), who is convinced that Salas stole his time.  When Salas' mother runs out of time, he transforms into a daredevil with nothing to lose, hellbent on getting revenge against the system.

The system is embodied by one of the richest men in the sector, 90-year old time-lender Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and his wide-eyed 27-year-old daughter Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried).  It's not long before Salas climbs his way up the social ladder through ample measures of wits, charm, and violence.

In Time has an art aesthetic similar to Equilibrium, embracing a militaristic style of dark colors, smooth lines, and hot women sheathed in stockings and heels.  No one wears sensible shoes in this movie. There are no cell phones and the vehicles look like muscle cars from the 60s.

In Time is only as effective as its polemic. Lurking beneath the movie's long shots of pretty people are hot button topics: class warfare, overpopulation, credit scores determining your future, conspiracy theories about an unjust government, the plight of the working man and his aspirations, bank bailouts, and more.  In Time is a little rough around the edges, the dialogue is occasionally trite, and the plot can be uneven, but its message is very - ahem - timely.",1321056000,13,3327,4.8189806678383125
4412495,5,B004LWZW7E,"Fresh New Concept!  Timberlake, much to my surprise, plays the role very well (other than his crying scene) and Seyfried is quite the minx.  While I think they could've done a little more with the development, I still give it 5 stars due to how surprisingly enjoyable the movie was.  Highly recommended!",1320883200,6,303,4.788461538461538
4412496,2,B004LWZW7E,"**Warning: This review contains spoilers.**

In Time is an action film for pretty boys - particularly pretty-boy television stars. Justin Timberlake stars as Will Salas, one of many who live in a futuristic world where physical aging stops at the age of 25. However, this is also the point where the LED clock on your arm starts to tick down to zero, at which point the rest of your life is spent chasing after minutes to keep yourself alive to, essentially, chase after more minutes like a junkie.  These minutes can be gained through metal devices designed for the purpose, or in small amounts from those generous enough to share. Time is either treated as currency or a drug, with the next fix or payout always being slightly out of reach.

There are many moments in this film in which I became consciously aware that I wasn't buying what they were trying to sell me. Straight out of the gate, we are supposed to believe that Olivia Wilde is Timberlake's mom. I was squirming in my seat during their first scene together, imagining that some sordid episode between the two would eventually result.

Cut to Salas hanging out in a bar that introduces us to both of the television stars of the film. Johnny Galecki (The Big Bang Theory) is Salas' best friend, a drunken loser whose wife is raising the kids while he indulges in nightly binges. Serendipitously, Timberlake and Galecki are in the bar the same night as Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer - White Collar) who ""has a lot of time on his hands."" That is to say, he's rich. The ""minutemen"" (thugs) have tracked Hamilton down to this very bar to fight him for his wealth.

To clarify, ""fighting"" consists of limp-wristed arm-wrestling where those involved press their clocks together blood-brothers style in an effort to make time run down. The victor walks away, still in possession of his own time, with the added bonus of the other party's time. To ""time out"" is to die.

Salas ends up saving Hamilton's ""life."" He then takes Hamilton to a warehouse to hide out and finds out that Hamilton is over 100 years old.  In the morning, Hamilton gifts Salas with all of his time while Salas sleeps, save for enough time to get Hamilton to the nearest bridge so that he can sit atop it and plummet from it dramatically when his clock times out.

Since this is not a suicide per se, the only explanation for his chosen location that I could come up with is to get the police involved. Enter ""timekeeper"" Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), the ""timecop"" (oh yes, I went there) tasked with investigating where all of that ""time"" went.

Of course, immediately following Salas' ""gift of time,"" his mom ends up ""timing out"" during what is to become the first of many long-distance, stiletto-heeled runs that were prerequisites for actresses who wanted a part in this film. I laughed at how quickly her clock ran down. No other passage of time in films that I have seen to date was treated with as quick a cut as this. I grimaced as Timberlake proved my trope anticipation correct, as he held his mother's lifeless body in his arms and screamed ""Nooooooo!"" at the top of his lungs.

Now that Mommy's dead, Salas vows to take revenge on the rich folks who live in a different ""time zone,"" despite the fact that they have zero to do with his mother's death. But they're still bad guys because they're driving up the prices on time (it's difficult to make that concept sound serious), a practice that will eventually kill everyone.

On his travels, Salas meets Phillippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser - Mad Men) and his daughter, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), the obvious love interest.  (Where do they come up with these names?) Another awful clich rears its head when Salas halfheartedly attempts to teach Sylvia how to live life on the edge by taking her for a swim in the ocean that is her backyard. (That's not a joke.  These people are that rich.)

Of course, Leon tracks Salas down to this location and, to no one's surprise, Salas breaks free. He grabs Sylvia by the arm, effectively dragging her into the police cat/criminal mice game, which is replete with a dash of ""minutemen"" and a spot of weak car chase.

What is the purpose of these ""minutemen"" anyway? Is their existence proof that time isn't the only threat to man? The film's climax involving the showdown between Salas and said minutemen is boring, and the film ends on a Robin Hood-meets-Bonnie and Clyde note. By the end, I was surprised to realize just how many times I had zoned out during the course of the film.

I enjoyed seeing that Murphy was awarded more screen time, but for a film like this, it doesn't even matter. Bomer, Seyfried and Kartheiser are believable, though Kartheiser seems typecast as his Pete Campbell character. Timberlake is outshone here when pitted against these veterans, despite being the star of the show.  It doesn't help that his acting is pretty paltry.  Stick to Saturday Night Live, JT.

I truly believe that there was a bet going on where they wanted to see just how many time-related puns they could fit into 109 minutes.  And the CGI, when employed, is pretty laughable. The concept of tangible time is interesting enough, but the idea is stretched so thin that it becomes transparent, and the script, with its trite and lackluster dialogue, appears to be a first-year film student's attempt. The trailer is very misleading by purporting that In Time is an action film. In Time is more of a heist film, and it's not a very good one.

I Give This Film: 2 stars

4412498,4,B004LWZW7E,"In the future ""time is money."" Literally. People live to 25 years old, after which time they have one year left, then they die. The good news is that you can buy time and live forever, but only the rich can do that. Everyone else is struggling to stay alive. Currency is done in time, transferred by computer chips installed in the forearm. A cup of coffee will cost you 4 minutes of your life. I kept thinking about ""Logan's Run"" as I watched this film.

The cliche possibilities are endless and they are not shy about using them. ""All the time in world."" ""Got a minute."" ""Too much time on my hands"" ""Who's got the time?"" ""You must come from time."" ""Taken years off my life."" ""Drank his life away."" ""Too much time in the wrong hands..."" ""I had the time to buy one of these."" ""Thank you for your time."" ""The time he has taken."" ""It would take a million years."" Ouch!

""Hey big spender, spend a little time with me."" ""I'd give a year of my life just to spend an hour with her."" These didn't make the cut.

Timberlake plays Will Salas, a man struggling to pay the bills and stay alive along with his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde). Will saves the life of a rich man who was 108. He wanted to die. From him we get the class warfare speech of the movie. Many must die so a few might live. Taxes and prices are raised to make sure the poor die. Like most science fiction features, they have a social commentary.

While Will was asleep, the rich man gives him his time so he can die. Rich people literally live in a different ""time zone"" so they don't get mugged by those who work for the weekend.

Timberlake is 5 stars in comedies, but as a dramatic actor, he was unconvincing in this role, which may have been the director's fault. Will is supposed to have passion to distinguish himself from the cautious rich. He lacks, he should have never been in that role (Keanu Reeves spoiled us). Timberlake would have been more convincing as a rich tycoon. Much of the acting was stiff by design, but that made for a bad movie. Other than the time devices, the technology was circa 1985 with no pay phones, 80's automobiles, and no cell phones.

4412499,3,B004LWZW7E,"""IN TIME"" is a science fiction escapism film that is set in a time and place where money is no longer the currency, but time. Strange as it may seem, the whole thing felt like a really well done and extended version of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. In an alternate dimension, time and place, wealth is about how much time you have accumulated. The wealthiest of the people can be immortal while the poorest are accustom to waking up each day with 24 hours or even less left on their time ticker and everyone looks to be in their mid-twenties.

I'm pretty sure that the creators of ""In Time"" were fully aware of the parallels they were exploring with time being what we knows as money and as a fewer, those parallels hit home with me. The poor struggle from day to day to add to their life and to make it to the next sunrise by working thankless jobs and doing whatever it takes to survive as long as they can. The poor live a life of urgency as if the slightest mistake could end their lives. Meanwhile, the rich rush nowhere. They aren't worried about anything. They have control over their lives and how long they will live. Most of them will live forever.

Justin Timberlake capably plays ghetto regular Will Salas, who has a robin hood type persona, always ready to give up a little of his minutes to help out somebody who's in more need. This personality trait gets him a gift of 100 years and naturally, he moves away from the ghetto, where 100 years could get him killed by somebody wanting his time, to the upscale Greenwich where he meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried). Weis is the daughter of the man who holds all the cards, or time.

As the story plays out, ""In Time"" becomes a mix of ""Bonnie & Clyde"" meets ""Robin Hood"" and you definitely buy into the reasoning behind their plight.

""In Time"" is rich with creativity and sucks you in with skillful storytelling. The depth of its rich story reminded me of the creativity that went into the concepts surrounding ""The Matrix"" movie series. It isn't anywhere near as groundbreaking as the original ""Matrix"" movie was, but the same suspend belief and enjoy the ride is in place. At times the writing is outstanding and at times the writing is lackluster. At times the direction and settings are creative and entertaining and sometimes cheap and poorly staged.

""In Time"" could have been better had it been more polished in certain areas, but it is by no means a deal breaker. It is certainly a movie that people who love quality science fiction in the tradition of the ""Twilight Zone"" or movies of the 70s will enjoy. It isn't a special effects extravaganza and that's part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. It isn't trying to bribe people into liking it. You like the movie because of its concepts and the thought that went into it.",1320105600,11,2795,4.4833005893909625
4412500,3,B004LWZW7E,"Tempus fugit, bro. The movie title is lame but the premise is nifty and thought-provoking. I had to double check to make sure that Philip K. Dick didn't write this. But, no, Andrew Niccol penned the story and then shrugged and directed it, as well. Sometime in the near future, some messed up genius has figured out a way to genetically engineer the human body to halt the aging process once it attains 25 years. The catch is that once you reach 25, you're left with only a year to live. A digital clock activates on your forearm, begins to count down your last year of living. Except that there's a method by which you can add time to your body clock. In a world in which time has become currency, you can work for it, get paid in increments of  time. You can choose to barter an hour of your life for ten minutes of heaven with a lady of the evening. A call on a pay phone costs one minute, a bus ride an hour. In this reality, ""Tempus fugit"" has a horrific connotation.

One way to ascertain class status is by how leisurely or frantically someone is going about their business. In the ghetto district inhabited by Will Salas (Timberlake), people frequently eye their built-in clocks, frequently run during their errands. In the ghetto, people don't have time to kill, but they will murder for time. If you get caught napping, thieves can literally steal time from you. When the puzzled heiress wonders how people in the ghetto live like this, Will remarks, ""People don't much sleep in."" Phrases such as ""Don't waste my time"" or ""Do you have a minute?"" take on whole new breadths of meaning.

In this new world order, the gulf dividing the haves and have-nots has expanded exponentially. The rich can simply amass centuries' worth of time and, in essence, become immortal whereas the poverty-stricken desperately scramble to earn enough time to make it thru the day, sometimes thru the next hour. Will Salas is 28 years old (or ""25 + 3""). When a mysterious man (Matt Bomer) bequeathes Will Salas his century of life and then promptly commits suicide - in the parlance of the day, he ""times out"" - Will is suspected of murdering his benefactor. Because who would give away a century of life? Enter Cillian Murphy as the relentless head Timekeeper, the near future's version of law enforcement.

What do you do when you suddenly have a hundred years' worth of time? You skedaddle from the ghetto and crash New Greenwich, where the influential and the deep pockets dwell, is what. We track Will Salas' arc as he goes from ghetto factory worker to determined outlaw, fighting to effect a change. A key component to his transformation is his brush with Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), the sheltered 27-year-old (""25 + 2"") daughter of New Greenwich's wealthiest business mogul. (There's an even more crucial development which fuels Will's anti-establishment rage, but that might really be spoilering it - but you'll see it coming.) Sylvia Weis is one of them idle rich kids what has bodyguards trailing her, and she suffers from sheer ennui brought about by a lifetime bout of entitlement. You can imagine that spark of interest when she set eyes on Will, someone trying to blend - but not quite making it - into her rarified universe. The story applies an age-old plot device to throw Will and Sylvia together. Throw in the Timekeepers, and Will's decision to go down that dark road, and things suddenly take a Bonnie & Clyde turn but with a Robin Hood twist.

Carpe tempus, or something. Will's crusade to parcel out time to those in need has unintended consequences. He didn't plan on the lowlifes to start preying on those what just got free time handed to them. And, to play devil's advocate, it turns out, there's a checks and balances system in play. With immortality achievable, overpopulation is stringently kept at bay by the government's continuous price hikes and the taxes reflect this. Places like the ghettos are heavily impacted; the death toll evens the scales. So how righteous is Will's cause, really? His mantra is ""Is it stealing if it's already stolen?"" But maybe it sounds a bit too self-serving.

In this one Justin Timberlake isn't as locked in as he was in THE SOCIAL NETWORK, but he still has that big presence. IN TIME is a high concept sci-fi thriller, except that it knows that it's high concept. The metaphors fly thick and obvious. The allegory is transparent. The story is approached in a heavy-handed way. Timberlake and Seyfried are good together, but this is in spite of some laborious dialogue. So part of the film dragged for me. But there came a time when Amanda Seyfried's character was finally allowed to step out of her bored shell. Timberlake, scalp and jawline stubbled like all good action heroes should, does pretty well with the action sequences. All these nice good elements convince me to rate this sucker a better than average 3 out of 5 stars. It'd be higher but for those slow bits to slog thru and that whiff of stuffiness and that there isn't one truly knock-it-out-of-the-park moment in the film (although Timberlake and Pettyfer's time duel in the swanky hotel room comes close). So go. Carpe Fandango, or something.",1320105600,2,5168,4.711283185840708

First of all, the story is unique- centered around a perfectly horrifying metaphor for money; second, the special effects are top-notch- intensified by absorbing, futuristic backdrops; and third, what makes this movie the most charming flick in a while can be summed up in two words: Justin Timberlake. He is charismatic, smart, athletic and captivating. I am definitely looking forward to seeing him in more movies.
Another great thing about this film is that it is free of graphic sex scenes and can be watched as a family. How awesome is that?  Five stars",1522886400,,657,4.866071428571429

I watch many movies and there were so many jokes that played on old movies, it was a treat. It didn't use so many of the tricks that ruin movies today; especially CG, no sex or blood so watch it with your middle school kids after you bribe them with popcorn. Give me a good old fashioned movie in which characters talk to one another and move the story along with dialogue. Bottom line? A fun date night or family movie night (might even spark a discussion with your middle age kids!!)  that makes one think just enough without draining ones's brain, enough humor and action to maintain interest, and clear cut good guys and bad guys.

4413147,4,B004LWZW7E,"In Time is one of several almost low rent futuristic sci-fiers that is solidly entertaining and keeps tight to its original conceit. Starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, the movie riffs on Bonnie and Clyde and Robin Hood. In this dystopian future the rubble and rabble of the working class are paid in minutes and hours as their internal clock, set for 25 years, tocks down. Minutes is money, is the currency, and while you can buy more time to extend your life it seems to be far too easy to spend all that you have all too quickly. Timberlake is a quick and determined and selfless part of the poor world who finds himself surprisingly gifted with more time than he knows what to do with and, after he loses his mother literally at the last second before he can give her more of his time, he travels across time zones to the richest of all classes; people who have hundreds if not thousands of years stored in their genetic clock. Here he meets a disenchanted Seyfried who is trapped in a world where no one really lives or takes risks because they have so much to lose, and she makes off with Timberlake (actually, he kidnaps her, but shes kinda intrigued by him). The two form a partnership to undo the time-as-currency market, all the while barely staying seconds ahead of a cop and their own time running out. In Time lives in its conceit and though the movie is largely a chase movie, it still keeps its eyes on the contexts of the questions it asks early on: what does living really mean? Is time really money and money really time? How should people value relationships against rising and hostile markets? Is it okay for people to hoard an important quality? What is the nature of self-sacrifice and is it better to give or to receive? These and other important questions swirl within the scope of the action and adventure, and as some have criticized can get lost in the action elements, but they still bear out and make this movie a cerebral enough dystopian science fiction flick that succeeds. This is another film that can bring a family together in interesting conversation after the movie concludes, providing that the members are old enough to have the conversation. And I think Id like to hear some of those conversations. In Time is a good movie, and good for more than one viewing. A solid 4 stars.",1506297600,,2329,4.5608591885441525

""We're genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. The trouble is, we live only one more year - unless we can get more time. Time is now the currency. We earn it .. and spend it. The rich can live forever. And the rest of us ... I just want to wake up with more time on my hand than hours in the day.""

Truly, this is a world in which time IS money. The movie seems to say, that like money, there is enough time to go around if only the rich would share with the poor. If only resources were spread out. And so Salas and Sylvia Wise (Amanda Seyfried) attempt to become like futuristic Robin Hoods, taking time from the rich and giving to the poor. Sylvia's father is a timelender with ""eons"" of time, he's so rich. There are a number of foot chases and car chases as Will and Sylvia are chased by powerful business interests and the government (the police, timekeepers). Will they be able to change the world order or will they be caught?

""In Time"" made me think a little bit about the message of the modern Popes, particularly Francis and Blessed Pope Paul VI, but also St. John Paul II, about how rich nations (and individuals) should share with poor nations (and individuals). ""In Time"" is not an ""R""-rated movie, but some of the content definitely makes it a strong ""PG-13"". I can't say it's a great movie, and it drags at times. But it's an interesting idea and I don't want to give it a negative review and so I give it four stars. Justin Timberlake is a pretty good actor. I'll end with a quote I came across the day before seeing this movie that seems to fit here:

""One of the myriad ailments afflicting the modern world is the loss of the sense of the sacredness of time, a deafness to the rhythms that accentuate a truly Christian life."" - Pieter Vree, Editor, New Oxford Review, reviewing the book ""Numbering My Days"" by Chene Heady",1476316800,3,1963,4.340599455040872

Plainly stated - there are clock numbers on the forearm.  These numbers tick off seconds and the remaining numbers indicate the length of time people have left on the earth!

You stop aging at 25 years (so people generally are healthy looking), but you can get more time to live, and possibly forever if you are clever and resourceful (or mean and dastardly).

Will Salas: [voice over] I don't have time. I don't have time to worry about how it happened. It is what it is. Were genetically engineered to stop ageing at twenty five. The trouble is, we live only one more year, unless we can get more time. Time is now the currency. We earn it and spend it. The rich can live forever and the rest of us? I just wanna wake up with more time on my hand than hours in the day.

4416551,5,B004LWZW7E,"I really loved this movie, even though I must admit that the story was ridiculous and full of holes.

The rich are immortal and the poor survive day by day.
Everyone (except for some rich people who have vaults) has their ""money"" and ""time remaining to live"" in plain view on an arm.
Your lit-up arm clicks constantly as your ""time remaining"" and ""money available"" are interchangeable and keep going down unless you add to your arm.
How does anyone walk around without long sleeves?
How can you sleep, worrying that someone could steal from your arm while you are asleep, and therefore, you can die in your sleep, or wake up too broke to pay the rent or even have breakfast?
At any time, anyone can just grab your arm and take all of your money and end your life.
How could anyone in a future existence who is intelligent enough to come up with this be cruel enough to actually make it a reality.
And why isn't anyone else coming up with a way to destroy the arm clock, or at least figure out how to put locks on their arms.

I loved the message that the old man gave to Will just before he committed suicide, that no one should live forever, and no matter how wonderful your life is, you get tired of living because life was not meant to go on forever.
This reminded me of a line in a song, ""Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.""
The old man gave Will an amazing gift, but he also left Will in a lot of trouble.

Justin Timberlake showed no emotions in the entire movie, even when his mother died in his arms, I didn't feel any emotion coming out of him.  I think that this movie would have been so much better with a different actor.

I love Amanda Seyfried, but the wig that they put her in looked terrible, and she had no chemistry with Justin Timberlake.

All of the characters in this movie looked completely miserable.
The rich looked bored and annoyed and exhausted.
The poor looked desperate and anxious.

In spite of all of this, and some other little plot-holes, I loved this movie because I love science fiction, especially any movie that takes place in the future, and it was fast moving, and the concept really interested me, and I enjoy any movie that Amanda Seyfried is in.

The ending surprised me.

This movie was similar to the idea of Logan's Run, where everyone is killed at the age of 30, except that they are promised the lie that they are reincarnated.
I also loved Logan's Run, which I found much more believable and interesting.",1442534400,,2472,4.368191721132898

It wasn't a Marvel Comics based film or Bond flick.

So when it came up for sale for only $4.99 for the Blu-ray, I figure why not?

I don't want to ruin the story for the viewers, but let's just say for $4.99 it was a great price to pay for a great movie.  Justin Timberlake was great as was most of the other actors.  I loved the premise of the story, the acting and sets.

4417013,4,B004LWZW7E,"Usually sci-fi movies are basically action full time, with complex and sometimes understandable plot. However, in this movie you will see more than you expect since there is a philosophic meaning behind the story.

Living a life when your lifetime is used instead of money make you really appreciate each moment and people that surround you. Curiously, it represents exactly the opposite what many people live, in other words, living desperately behind the money and wanting more and more and often forget that life is short and when they realize they are about to die.

Another point the screenwriter wants to provide is the idea of no one can survive forever and people need to realize that regardless people's social class all of them have equal rights.

Certainly you will not watch the best movie you have ever seen but, after seeing this movie, I dare to say you might really consider the idea of making more value of each second of your life.",1436140800,2,949,4.774390243902439

Amanda Seyfried is alright, though she's mainly just eye candy, superb eye candy.  The film looks great, and moves at a nice enough pace.  In the end, it's an enjoyable ride, but given it's unique premise, I expected more.  There's little backstory here, even Timberlake's character in the very beginning narration says he has ""no time"" to explain things.  I think some backstory would have been great here.  You are kind of just thrown in to this world with so many questions left unanswered.

The acting is very good especially the lead Timekeeper played by Cillian Murphy ( you know he is going to jump).  I thought the relationship between Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried's characters were believable in the context of the story.  For me this is the one improvement over Gattaca, I never felt convinced that Uma Thurman's character would have had a change of heart and supported Ethan Hawke's Vincent in the end.

A fascinating premise that starts well but trails off until an ending that defies logic and economic reality. Lots of eye candy and, depending on your friends, it may invoke some interesting discussions on financial and social disparity, but it somehow disappoints.",1431043200,,529,4.666666666666667
4417219,5,B004LWZW7E,Recommend it!,1430956800,,13,6.0
4417220,4,B004LWZW7E,"This is one of those science fiction films that are based on a far out concept and used that concept as a metaphor for current issues. The issue is the separation and imbalance of economic classes. In many ways this movie has gotten a lot of flak playing on the 99% vs. 1% protests going on at the time. To be honest I don't watch movies so they can prove some social/economic point. I watch movies to be entertained, and in the end I was entertained by In Time. The film looks great, and has the right amount of drama and exploration into the story that keeps me interested. It's in no way a perfect script, but if you enjoy science fiction that speculates on a ""what if..."" scenario In Time Delivers.

In the future man discovers the genetic secret to stop aging. To battle the eventual threat of overpopulation everybody is born with a life clock that starts ticking when you reach the age 25. This clock starts with just one year left on it, and if it goes to zero you ""time out"" and die. So in order to stay alive you work or are given more time by another person (or time bank), but commerce is based on time too. So you have to pay for rent, food, bus fare, etc with your allotted time. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a struggling factory working living by the day (literally) until a mysterious stranger gives him over 100 years of time. Will is hunted by a police force called Timekeepers (led by Cillian Murphy), thinking he took his newly given time by murder. He eventually teams up with a young socialite (Amanda Seyfried) and start a Robin Hood style crime spree that threatens to unearth the entire system.

What makes the movie fascinating is the entire premise of your entire existence is now a commodity. You work for time, barter with it, give to friends and loved ones. It's the whole ""time is precious"" concept to a whole new meaning. With that little nugget of truth the movie runs full tilt on it. One of the very cool things about the film is how they show this new reality. Poor people (those with maybe a day on their clocks) run everywhere they go and seem to always be in rush while the rich people are very leisurely about their day. Family members pass time back and forth with each other in order to make sure the other can make it through the day. There is even a form of arm wrestling that saps your time from you when you engage in it. Lots of little things like that occur in the film, and that's what makes it fascinating. To be enveloped in this world where you simply cannot waste the time you have.

So the premise and the establishment of that premise is really where the real meat is on the film. The story is a pretty good way to move the film forward in this setting, but it's not Shakespeare either. There are lots of little details that don't seem to follow all the way through with the thinking at the time. They aren't plot holes, per se. However if you are a stickler for realism this may push your suspension of disbelief too far. Like how when Will and Sylvia can easily become ""time bandits"" (to coin a name from another sci-fi movie), stealing from time banks apparently with impunity. They seem unstoppable and nobody seems to be able to track them down in this crime spree. Also some added high tech elements fall flat like the electric cars that sound like they have pistons. I am guessing details like that aren't considered important for the story, and I can forgive them for that since I am so stoked about the things they got right. Still you should be aware of it.

The acting is actually quite good. I never saw Justin Timberlake as a dramatic actor. Just comedic. Yet his rendition of Will is convincing, and hits the dramatic notes when they are needed. One of the things I noticed in the direction is the actors who portray older people in young bodies actually give off that vibe that they have a level of experience of maturity over the younger crowd, even if everybody looks the same age. This is one of the better selling points in my opinion, and if they weren't able to pull it off at any level lower than this it would have lessen the film's impact on me significantly. Visually the movie looks really nice thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins. However you feel about the story or the thinly veiled metaphor on class warfare every shot and every scene looks perfect. The lighting, filtering and spacing give your eyes lots to feel good about.

The Blu-Ray looks amazing. It's a good representation of what a complete digital transfer from a high definition digital source can accomplish. The main track is a full 24bit 48kHz DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it sounds really good. Maybe not reference level, but I don't think any audiophiles out there will have any complaints. You also get Dolby Digital 5.1 in English, Spanish, and French (with Spanish and French subtitles). The extras are sparse, but I think they are worthwhile. More would have been welcome like a director commentary, but this isn't bad:

The Minutes - This is a mock documentary where the actors in the film play their characters as they are interviewed by a faceless commentator. It plays like an expose on the time inequality among the rich and poor, which gets a bit heavy handed in the preaching by the commentator. However it's a good way to introduce the world setting and gives some interesting info on the discovery that brought the world to where it is.

Deleted Scenes - Several very short deleted scenes that flesh out the characters and story a tiny bit, but I don't feel you missed anything with them gone. While I wouldn't mind seeing this footage come to a director cut or an uncut version of the film. I'm not going to shed a tear if one never comes out.

BD-Live - Connect your Blu-Ray to the Internet and get more extras. So far all I saw was a game and cast/crew profiles.

D-Box - If you have a D-Box enabled chair you get a code to experience this movie in it.

In Time shouldn't be looked as yet another science fiction movie preaching about wealth inequality. It should be looked as a dystopic future with a crazy concept that is worth exploring in the film. Some inconsistencies aside the movie is wonderfully presented. If you are a fan of speculative science fiction I recommend checking it out.",1430870400,,6268,4.480735551663748

I don't want to spoil so I will say the second time at my doctors office on my cell phone downloaded with my vudu account, I got into the action part of it and actually enjoyed it in the 65 -70 % percentile a movie can be enjoyed it beats reading doctors magazines.  I will watch the end at my next months doctores appointment but it's kind of predictable, just a point of seeing how they do what I know they will do.

4417453,5,B004LWZW7E,"I've been a science fiction fanatic longer than most people have been alive, and I enjoyed the H-ll out of In Time. The movie is a regular blizzard of philosophical, theological, political, and existential issues and questions. It even makes a serious attempt to cope with Christian communist existentialism. You almost never see this because it's too difficult for many Christians to face the fact that Jesus was the first real communist, and it's blatant in the New Testament in Acts, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Romans, 1st and 2nd Corinthians, both letters to the Thessalonians, 1st John, and Colossians. Marx himself said that his idea for communism came directly from Acts. Many Christians don't like the subject of existentialism, either. This is odd, since Jesus was always trying to get people to live in the moment. We don't want to live in our drab moments; we try to live in the future, as if that's possible.

The film treats philosophical and political issues as intelligently as the two subjects above.

There are hardly any special effects in In Time, and that was a good idea, too. Special effects would have been a distraction from the story being told. Don't get me wrong. I love special effects. But this science fiction film just didn't need them.",1426032000,,1261,4.88785046728972

Really interesting premise and one that you'd like to explore further - there must be so many other stories in this world (when a story makes you want to look around corners to see what else is out there, you're in a good one). The plot is a bit contrived which makes for a semi-rocky start and some overdrawn coincidences, but once it gets rolling it does a good job of keeping you engaged. Some stereotypical actions from the characters, but they do rise above two dimensional cutouts so we do actually care what happens. We've seen this story told many, many times in the sci-fi genre, but this is a welcome chapter and well worth seeing.

Side note/personal peeve: why do foley editors signify ""the future"" by adding same droning whine to their transportation. If the world hasn't convinced us, this wont. IMO, the police cars had enough ominous presence that they could have run silently and it would have been more impactful.

This includes the very talented writer-director of science fiction - Andrew Niccol. Love him or hate him, Justin Timberlake has bullied through all meager expectations of him as a singer-turned-actor to become a Hollywood man-on-the-make. Since the HBO Series Big Love ended, Amanda Seyfried has been in a plethora of films involving diverse roles - not all are good, but they are all intriguing (i.e. Mamma Mia or Chloe). Also, Cillian Murphy is a rising star in the villain category. Just keep your eyes on Niccol, Timberlake, Seyfried, and Murphy - bigger and better thing are to come.",1420934400,,736,4.896

For example, a cup of coffee might cost you 2 minutes, while your monthly rent might run well over an hour.

4418148,3,B004LWZW7E,"In Time
 In Time has a promising Sci-fi premise that fails to follow up.  The old adage that Time is Money is the reality of this near future tale.  Through the magic of technology people are paid in minutes and hours and are charged in the same currency.  Everyone has a self destruct function built into each and every one which goes off when a citizen hit an age twenty five.  The kicker is that if you have time on your personal clock, you cheat death.  Time can be earned, stolen, swapped or gambled away but no one ever ages beyond age twenty five, which I suppose is some recompense for the harshest of time driven task masters.  It is a bit confusing, as when the protagonist is introduced to the three generations of females in a family, the mother, mother-in-law and daughter all look to be twenty five.
 Justin Timberlake has the lead and shows that his most telling talent is as an actor rather than as the singer he was earlier in his career.  Olivia Wilde-notably seen in TVs House as Number Thirteen-plays his mum.  It does dress a set up with all the actors being young and attractive.  Amanda Seyfried (who appeared in supporting roles in Mean Girls Momma Mia and Jenifers Body) wears a wig and fills the role of a Patty Hurst style rich girl who becomes enmeshed in bank robbery with the bad boy from the slums, Timberlake.  Cillian Murphy (who chilled us as the Scarecrow in Batman Begins and served in the very successful Zombie flick 28 Days Later) is the relentless time cop who tracks the robbers of the time banks.  The actors are all quite good in their roles, that isn't the problem
 The problem is with the script, which leaves too many unanswered questions.  If the film is to be an allegory, the rich are too rich the poor too poor and so on, well and good.  But even at that level we have to have the plot elements hang together.  We never have a feeling for how or why society changed from money, which we have been using for some time now, to time itself as a medium of exchange.  We don't know how it is managed, in an economic sense.  The result, no matter how dramatic the situations, is nonsense.  Director/writer Andrew Niccol, one of the bright lights to come from New Zealand lately, does not reach the level of either the disturbing Gattaca or the very entertaining Lord of War, both of which he also both wrote and directed.  The direction is just fine, it is the writing that lacks.  This is surprising as Niccol also penned The Terminal and The Truman Show, both of which were and deserved to be well received.
 This two saw blade disappointment is rated a tame PG-13 and this for some don't show semi-nudity, language and violence.  It lasts for one hour and thirty nine minutes.  With a strong cast doing well and good direction, this one could have been a contender but the internal absurdities overcame many clever ideas and the exciting Robin Hood story.",1416182400,,2902,4.481904761904762
4418149,4,B004LWZW7E,"The plot coincides with the current political argument that the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer. That being said, it's an action packed movie with some good acting. My wife, young niece and I all enjoyed the movie.

4418296,4,B004LWZW7E,"The premise of this film is really clever, and fully explained in the first few minutes.  After that, the writing is standard action fare.  The actors are much better than the script, the action is beautifully paced, and the sets and costumes feel like a different world.  That's why I didn't mind the predictable plot or endless swamp of cliches and ignorant politics that should have bogged it down.  Since the premise is ostensibly an economic one, it's unfortunate that the screenwriter clearly lacks even a passing understanding of economics or history.  You remember the half-bright kids in grade school who thought communism sounded good because the world isn't fair and we ought to change the system, dammit?  Well, they wrote a movie.  Fortunately, real Hollywood Filmmakers made the movie, so it's a fun, slick, sexy waste of time.  Ironic, now that I think about it.  Try not to think, and you should enjoy this.",1414713600,,923,4.903225806451613

4418398,4,B004LWZW7E,"In Time was definitely not a waste of time to see. In a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, where instead of money the currency is time giving you a shot at immortal youth. Unfortunately, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and now is on the run with a hostage who becomes the connection he needs for his war against the system.  This film was written and directed by Andrew Niccol who is known for directing Gattaca, S1m0ne and Lord of War.

In a future society, people are genetically modified to stop aging at twenty five which seems pretty cool but there is a catch and that is after that a clock is activated with one more year of life for each citizen. Time is now the currency and the wealthy that live in the New Greenwich are immortals, while the poor live in ghettos in time zones are exploited and forced to live looking at their clock all the time forcing them to work, borrow, beg or steal to stay alive. Thieves known as Minute Men steal time and men known as the timekeepers are the police who are suppose to control the society. When the worker Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) saves the rich Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) from a dangerous gang of thieves, Henry tells that he is 105 years old and that he is done living, he doesn't want to be immortal and thinks everyone should die at some point.

Henry feels that Will can do something good with his time so when he is sleeping Henry gives him more than one hundred years to him and then commits suicide on a bridge.  He did it though with enough time on his clock for Will to run to him and now he is a suspect for murder. Later that evening Will is suppose to meet his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde) but time increase makes her unable to use the bus.  She has to try and run the entire way to Will, he tries to credit time to her but she dies before the transference. Angry with the way things are done Will heads to New Greenwich but the timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) believes that he killed Henry to steal his time based off of a surveillance video he saw of Will running to Henry .

Will flirts with Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), who is the spoiled yet suffocated daughter of the millionaire Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser), that he met in a party when he was in New Greenwich. Raymond followed Will there and removes all the time from him that he ""stole"" and tries to arrest him.  Will Salas kidnaps Sylvia and brings her to the ghetto where he lives. Understanding how despicable her father is when he won't pay to get her back, Sylvia decides to help Will, they steal a large quantity of time to fight against the system.

Although it was an interesting concept I don't think I would want to live in a world like this.  My favorite scene in this film is the one above where he is fighting for his time and then he takes care of business.  It's seamless and a very cool scene to watch.  Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried worked very well together and were enjoyable to watch.  There were some things that just bothered me, like his mom giving him 30 minutes... that would have saved her life!!! Also everyone looking 25 is just creepy having your mom look the same age as you.  Like the photo I have above with the mother wife and daughter...it would drive me crazy!

That being said this movie was fun but not the best I have seen so I give it a B.  Just the things from the story that drive me crazy are probably why I can't give it higher.",1412640000,,3487,4.318529862174579

4418507,4,B004LWZW7E,"This movie was stronger than I expected, but the ending was surprisingly disappointing. I say ""surprisingly"" because there seemed to be a number of interesting directions that they could have pursued. In fact, it would have been even better if they spent the last fifteen minutes of the movie further fraying some of those lose ends to let the viewers stew over different possibilities after the movie. Instead, after the movie makes its main point about the concentration of the wealth of society into the hands of so few (and the ultimate consequences for the many), it decides to turn the protagonists into Bonnie and Clyde figures. This is not only unnecessary, but it confuses some of the point. You go from thinking the system has collapsed due to their earlier activities to seeing that there are still more banks to rob -- and so the system is apparently far from collapsing. So it's inconsistent and isn't super satisfying at the end.

But I was very happy with the cast. JT does a great job in this serious role, and the supporting cast is pretty good. I liked the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy, who seems to be typecasted for these kinds of roles), but I was disappointed that the storyline didn't make him even more of a conflicted character. That is, he was obviously conflicted on paper, but his character just didn't show it. And there could have been more of an investigation of the relationship between the Timekeeper, JT's father, and JT.

So I really felt like this movie had a lot of potential, and it had a cast that probably had the talent to pull it off. But it just wasn't as polished as it should have been. Maybe another time...",1409616000,,1651,4.6506849315068495

4418746,3,B004LWZW7E,"In Time Flawed premise, good discussion starter.

Andrew Niccol has created a serious movie.  Niccol is a writer and director who takes ideas seriously. When a writer takes ideas seriously you cant dismiss his conclusions merely as entertainment.  When a director takes ideas seriously you cant treat plot decisions as just an excuse to get buts in seats to sell popcorn.  As proof of Mr. Niccols seriousness I submit a few quotes from his collider.com interview on the topic of this very movie. http://collider.com/andrew-niccol-in-time-the-host-interview/

COOK: The movie posits the solution [to the dystopian time divide] is a redistribution of time, which of course correlates to a redistribution of wealth. Do you feel thats the solution to the current economic woes of the country?
NICCOL: I make movies. Im not in politics. But I think theres probably enough to go around, if you know what I mean.

COOK: Well then  how does the underdog achieve the impossible and succeed in this rigged game?
NICCOL: How do you do it? If you look around the world  how they're doing it is through revolution.
COOK: It seems thats what the film is advocating for: fairly radical revolution.
NICCOL: I wouldnt argue with that.

Now I will concede that Cook is leading the questions, but Niccol is agreeing. I would suggest reading the rest of the interview if you aren't convinced.  Despite Niccols admission that he isn't a politician, he is still a writer with influence to have his ideas seen by many and politicians aren't the only ones who have serious ideas to consider.

Flawed Premise
Ive established why you should entertain thinking longer about this film and why you should be taking its plot seriously. Let us examine the flaw after a quick recap of the movies premise.  In Time constructs an analogy to our real world via his characters and constraints placed on those characters. The most obvious of which is a requirement that you must beg, steal or toil for time credits that allow the genetically modified humans to continue living beyond their 1 year allowance given to them after reaching age 25. The obvious connection to reality here is the similarity found with money and its ability to impact the length of our life. However, there is a very important difference between reality and the world that Niccol depicts. The difference is far more important than trivial issues like the fact that we don't have clocks in our arms.  The difference that kills the analogy and invalidates any conclusions (and suggestions) that Niccol puts forth is the problem of isolation.  In reality an isolated person, say a survivor of a plane crash on a deserted island is capable of creating wealth (ie. values) without begging and stealing from others.  Now its true that an isolated person would toil much to create his lean-to hut and food. That much is similar in the analogy. However, the difference is that no one else needed to be around for the toiling to produce the life extending effects that wealth creation provides. This survivor can shorten or lengthen his existence by either ignoring the resources of his environment or exploiting them for his ends. The wiser his decisions and keener his perceptions the longer he lives.  Niccol commits the Fallacy of Static Wealth.  Wealth creation happens in large part by invention and discovery.  Invention and discovery happen because individuals use their minds and exploit the resources around them to meet their ends.  Wealth creation also happens by re-applying existing inventions and discoveries back onto the individual problem of survival.  Im sure that Niccoli wants his analogy to be valid. He wants the viewer to project back into their life with principles drawn from the characters and premise of the movie. In the movie we see people are tied to one another as time can only be exchanged between people (and through time-boxes) and not created independently (or by a group presumably). This constraint fails to describe the actual world we live in.
In closing, this movie can be enjoyed if treated as a conversation starter or as an exercise in fallacy detection.",1406246400,,4129,4.965166908563135

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

'In Time' was written, directed and produced by Andrew Niccol. Set in 2169, a genetically engineered populace can only live to age 25; beyond that they're given one year which will expire, unless time (which appears as a fluorescent counter on their forearms), is replenished. This gimmick of time for money, is perhaps the only real clever conceit of the film. I enjoyed watching how much a cup of coffee went for (a few minutes) as opposed to the price of a new car (such a purchase would put the purchaser back a good number of months).

Todd McCarthy writes in the Hollywood Reporter that the film suffers at the outset from a lack of a back story: ""As cleverly conceived as it is, the time-for-money substitution leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Other than for Leon and a few flunkies, there are no authority figures visible or alluded to. Who runs the country, the city? Is the rest of the world like this? How did the aging process get halted? Given so remarkable an achievement, why are there no other comparable technological advances? Why are all the cars customized early 1960s Lincoln Continentals, Jags and Cadillacs?""

Justin Timberlake plays the protagonist, Will Salas, who lives in the economically depressed time zone, Dayton, where the population scrounges day to day, attempting to add precious minutes to their time clock, just to stay alive. The film's break into act two occurs when Salas meets up with a man, Hamilton, who's willing to give him a century of time for nothing in exchange. It's a scene which reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode, 'Long live Walter Jameson', where a man sips a magic motion two thousand years ago and discovers that he never ages. Unlike Twilight Zone, where the man is afraid to die, in this case, Hamilton is tired of living.

This leads to the melodramatic scene where Salas' mother (played by Olivia Wilder who is younger than Timberlake in real life) doesn't have enough time to get on a bus as the normal fare has been raised due to inflation. She's reduced to attempting to run home before the clock runs out but doesn't make it, falling into Will's arms, just as her counter lands on zero. It feels odd that she didn't prepare for this contingency but the whole idea is to emphasize the great divide between the haves and the haves-not. Salas blames the affluent who hoard time in the richest time zone, ""New Greenwich,"" for his mother's death. The zone is run by a time hoarding mogul, Phillipe Weis, who is basically your stereotypical 'robber baron', a stock villain.

Salas' plan is to somehow institute his own brand of class warfare by getting his hands on Weis' 'eons' and redistribute it to the people. When he arrives in New Greenwich, Weis introduces him to his extended family. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine notes the problem in having everyone the same age in the film: "" A bit more background on the origins of this genetics-predicated social structure would have better fleshed out his narrative, especially with regard to the confounding reality that--since everyone is physically stuck at 25 years old, as epitomized by a hilariously creepy lineup of Philippe's mother-in-law, wife, and daughter--people's romantic and sexual attractions to others must be hopelessly confused by the disconnect between their appearances and age.""

In the second half, 'In Time' devolves into your basic crime caper flick replete with foot chases and car crashes. With Will now hooked up with Phillipe's daughter, Sylvia, the two play a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde attempting to elude both the police in the guise of Timekeeper Leon as well as the nasty 'Minuteman' gang member, Fortis. There's a very awkward and unconvincing scene toward the end where Will and Sylvia take Sylvia's father hostage and in the end, make good on their goal of grabbing his 1,000,000 years and redistributing all that time to the common people.

The worst part of 'In Time is the clumsy climax. Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine, sums it up best: ""And though there's a vaguely socialist theme of wealth redistribution running through the film, it's never clear what the final goal is for the two time bandits in love: Are they looking to abolish the time-is-money system altogether, or just eke out a few more years for the downtrodden?""

Perhaps the most critical and perhaps enjoyable critique is from Kyle Smith in The NY Post. Part of his criticism involves the narrative's lack of verisimilitude: ""Chunks of time (which look like Atari video- game cartridges from 1978 that have been dipped in aluminum) sit barely guarded in vaults that can be breached simply by driving a truck into them,"" as well as a lack of an explanation as to how Leon the Timekeeper is able to confiscate all of Will's time, when he has no evidence that he was guilty of stealing from the 105 year old man. Smith's main criticism comes back to the theme of class warfare: ""The allegory nullifies itself in inviting comparison to reality. Life is more egalitarian than it is in this movie, because while rich people may have more toys, their wealth doesn't buy them the most precious resource. Warren Buffett won't outlive his secretary by centuries.""

In the end this is a film that has a clever premise which will keep you watching pretty much to the end. Nonetheless, the plot is awkwardly constructed, leading to a climax which is hardly what I would call thrilling. The lack of thrills perhaps can be attributed to a lack of high stakes as Salas is merely redistributing the wealth and not saving the population from imminent annihilation.",1400976000,,5635,4.817993795243019

Justin Timberlake finally showed his true acting abilities in my opinion, with the skills and ability of a good director and story writers. His co-star, whom I had never heard of, was just as gifted an actor as Justin is. I was really impressed with how she and Justin took the story to un-imaginary heights and vision. The story took me on journey of passion and adventure, as if I was there with them in time and space. After watching the movie television several times with commercial interuptions, I had to purchase ""InTime"", to include into my movie collections and seeing that the movie was made such a time ago and I had never seen it before, made me place the movie into my ""Classic Film collection"". It is a movie that you enjoy seeing over and over again, with the same effect and that's what I deem a ""Classic"". Very intense, passionate and a thrilling story is told. I loved this movie and others wil too.",1390089600,,972,4.56
4419533,4,B004LWZW7E,"I found this film quite watchable and slightly above the usual (not very high) level of Sci-Fi works usually served by Hollywood. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.

In XXII century people are born genetically engineered, in such a way that when they turn 25, they stop aging. However, at the same time their integrated bionical clock (installed at birth with the display interface appearing on the forearm) begins counting down. The clock bears 1 year of time - when it reaches zero, the person ""times out"" and is killed instantly. Time on bionical clocks is the universal and ONLY legal currency - people can earn more time, mostly by working for a wage (donation transfers are also possible) but also have to spend it by purchasing goods and services. The country is rigidly divided into ""time zones"", based on the wealth of their populations. Inevitably, in this world too there are criminals, including the bandits robbing people of their time (and therefore also life) - those despised but greatly feared gangsters are called ""Minute Men"". There is also of course the police, an elite force of Timekeepers...

The main hero of the story is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a simple factory worker, exercing a low paid blue-collar job. Together with his widowed mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde) he lives in the poorest ""time zone"". Both of them are hard-working, honest, likeable people and they rather enjoy their simple life - until one fateful day when Will meets a really weird drunk guy in a bar... And then the story really begins and I will say no more, except that at one moment his path will cross those of a morbidly rich guy, a certain Philip Weis (Vincent Kartheiser), his jaded and very bored daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), an extremely dangerous Minuteman known only as ""Fortis"" (Alex Pettyfer) and a very competent but completely fanatical in a Javert-like way Timekeeper, detective Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy).

As recent Sci-Fi films go, this one, without being a real masterpiece, is better than most and I actually liked it. The whole idea, not really easy to keep under control, is not half-bad treated. Scenario and dialogs are not bad at all. Action scenes are not really the point in this film, but the few included are quite honest. Characters are rather well developped and there is less stereotypes here than usually - even the morbidly rich guy and the main gangster have their story to tell, instead of just being evil and die a horrible screaming death.

The greatest and best surprise in this film is Justin Timberlake - I really didn't expect it but I actually LIKED his performance! The rest of cast is good too, with Amanda Seyfried proving here again that she is much more than just a pretty face. Even Alex Pettyfer redeems himself after this ""I am number four abomination""...

One thing I didn't exactly like is the idea that you can fix the wrongs of an unfair society by robbing the banks at gunpoint... It may seem an obvious choice, but as most easy fixes of complex problems (and especially VIOLENT easy fixes) it has ""highway to hell"" written all over it - and yet the makers of this film seem to propose just such a way to deal with the problem.

Now, there is another thing (this is not a criticism of the film here) which I found VERY interesting and rather funny, is that the makers of this film wanted almost certainly to criticise capitalism and its injustices - and ended by producing an ardent criticism of socialism and a great vibrant tribute to the Western model of society, based on democracy and free market economy instead...))) And here is how they did it:

- the political model of the world described in this film is clearly totalitarian in its political aspect as there is no political parties, no organised opposition, no free media, no labour unions, there seems to not even be a real justice system (!), etc. - there are only some NGO charities tolerated... Therefore the state stands alone above everything, towers over the unorgainsed individuals and therefore can bully and crush them at will. Well, such is not the case in modern capitalist countries - in fact it is exactly the opposite, everywhere where advanced, developped capitalism exists there are also organised parties, labour unions, free press and above everything else the counter-power of courts fo justice...

- even more important is the socio-economic aspect of this not so brave new world - it is clearly socialist! You want proof? Well, let me count the ways: the state FIXES prices of everything by administrative decision (so there is no free market and therefore no-capitalism); everybody MUST adhere to the state owned and state controlled unique health care program and there is NO ESCAPE possible (like with Obamacare); state has the monopoly of the control and distribution of the most crucial resource - the technology of anti-ageing and its dark passenger, the ""out of time"" death swith""; all kind of competition which could offer similar technology without the integration of a death switch was clearly eliminated by the state, etc., etc.

- in fact, the totalitarian control of the state over the economy in this reality seems to be so strong, that there is not even a hint at the existence of black market, on which goods and services could be traded against other kind of money than time - me for one I can very easily imagine, that people would be ready to save their precious days, hours and even seconds by buying illegally stuff using ANY other variety of money, like things stolen from the factories (stealing from workplace was how millions of people survived the misery of communism), labour or even sex (it is after all a place in which women are never older than 25 - and a 25 year old woman, if she REALLY wanted it, would always find a way to stop buying food with hours of her life...)

Therefore the obvious way of getting out of this totalitarian, socialist nightmare was not to rob banks, but to dismantle the state monopolies, adopt a good anti-trust legislation, let the market fix the prices instead of the corrupt oligarchy and especially let people organise in political parties and labour unions and then have free elections - which is the way things are done today in developped capitalist countries, for the greatest benefit of all. Elections and free market are almost always the solution - robbing banks virtually never is.

OK, this is only a film, so I will finish my lecture (rant?) here and go to the conclusion. This is actually a decent, rather good Sci-Fi film, with good actors and not so stupid scenario - it's just that the conclusion in form of message ""Bonnie and Clyde were right"" in my opinion hurt it a little. But still, a film well worth watching. Enjoy!",1389830400,,6773,4.78034188034188

4419536,4,B004LWZW7E,"Let's get one thing out of the way up front--this movie does have a social message to it:  income disparity is a problem.  That's an overarching theme.  I think it was played out well and the movie did illustrate why this social problem at an extreme can have drastic consequences.

I thought that it was a fun movie--I love sci-fi movies for their ability to take a converation into a ""safe"" place to discuss cultural issues.  The overall feel of the movie seemed to be borrowing from Gattaca's style (though I think Gattaca was a *way better movie and story)

JT did a great job as the lead and I wasn't thinking the whole time ""that's Justin Timberlake.""  He pulled me into the storyline.

All in all, I thought this was definitely an enjoyable movie that wasn't over-gimmicked like a lot of sci-fi movies are tempted to be.",1389744000,,827,4.54054054054054

4419667,3,B004LWZW7E,"The movie was ok. I think the concept is great but the script lacks in intensity and has low character development. Do I recommend it: probably to the right people, but to the majority no. Watch it when you can for free and make up your own mind. I wrote a lot below to describe a bit more. But to be fair I am writing this at 4am, so I may ramble a bit.

I really wanted more from this movie. The first 20 minutes were fantastic. Then it goes, as others reviewed would call it, ""Spiraling out of control"". People are paid with time. Once your time runs out on your arm clock you die. People can stay immortal as long as their clock never runs out. Poor people die quicker than rich people. You have Districts that contain different classes of people based on their time allotments. Justin Timberlake's character (Will) starts in the ""Ghetto"" and has a ""mission"" of destroying the gap of all the districts. Thats the premise and it's seems interesting enough and if it is done well, the story could be really good. Problems:
1. They introduced a lot of Characters that could have been very strong, but were so underdeveloped that they left you in the dark. Everyone had a potentially intertwined story that could have been really interesting, but someone decided not to write.
2. Sylvia Weis (Seyfried) was a hot mess. Her character went from weak to confused, and back to weak again, with moments of trying to be a badass. And to top it off the character really didn't need to be part of the movie.
3. The Time Keepers...If there is a camera showing Will at the scene, surely there was footage of Henry going there on his own and dying on his own.
4. Our first trip through the districts were made to seem like it was this whole expensive and long journey, but afterwards they travel from end to end like it was right next door. And do you only need to pay one way?
5. The ghetto should have been more like a ghetto. And I am sorry, but how does 1 man with a posse of 4 run an entire district even after everyone gets free time. And how does he not know what is going on.
6. Running away from the Time Keepers, but you make sure to stop and look back directly at them to give a stupid one-liner. What the hell. You are running away, RUN AWAY!
7. The flipping convertible. I am sorry you both would be dead.
8. If you have 2 people that you want to steal from and you are a group of 4, why are 3 of you waiting for 1 person to steal. Wouldn't all of you do it, it is more efficient.
9. When you both look at your clocks with 1 minute to spare and counting, the whole stopping to say goodbye and giving a kiss seems a little drawn out. No urgency to the fact you both will be dead. I would have preferred a Shakespearian ending.
10. Cillian Murphy - The end was a cop out.
11. Really, 1,000,000 years. How about no more CLOCKS!
Pros:
Justin Timberlake did a pretty good job with this even though he was given some crappy lines. Someone did not edit the script properly.
The movie editing surprisingly was pretty good. Except for the eye rolling lines every 10 minutes or so, the pace was well done.
THE SOUNDTRACK is the best. Craig Armstrong.
The scene where Will and his mom are running at each other was intense. The scene with Will and Sylvia not so much.
Amanda Seyfried's hair - AMAZING! Perfect for this genre.",1386633600,3,3316,4.2634920634920634

4419709,4,B004LWZW7E,"I have been a science fiction movie buff most of my life.  This movie, ""In Time""  has an interesting and unique story line.  In the future, traditional money is replaced with time units.  Everyone is given a certain amount of time and aging stops at 25.  This situation forces people to do whatever they can to steal, inherit or borrow more time to stay alive.  Like a lot of science fiction movies that have come out lately, the writers just cannot make a film without demonizing the evil corporations  (Those dirty, filthy capitalists theme myth), and glorifying socialism and big government.  The scenes of living on the poor side of town seems to be a favorite but familiar story, as the rich and powerful live in luxury with plenty of time to spend, the poor side struggle to survive after age 25. The answer, of course, is time distribution (replaces the old socialist false premise of ""wealth distribution."") for all people.

Even though I did not like the unoriginal ""capitalism bad and socialism is good""  basic theme; nevertheless,  the acting by these new performers, Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, in this film is good and there is quite a bit of interesting action scenes.  If you are into science fiction movies with a unique approach (Time buying) you might want to check out this movie.  Other than the old socialist political theme, this was an okay action movie.

4419754,4,B004LWZW7E,"In Time focuses on the future, where the world has decided to remove the gene that causes people to age. As a means to control this, you stop aging at 25 years old and they you will leave one more year unless you earn more time. Time though is also the currency of this era buying things such as coffee, hotel rooms, and meals. Overall, I loved the concept of In Time and was intrigued from the very beginning. While the concept is very interesting, there are a number of flaws which while not a deal breaker, frustrated me as a viewer such as in a world trying to avoid anarchy, the simplicity of transferring time by touch seems a bit to...simple. Maybe that's just me though. In addition, a few questions are raised that are never answered, and secondary character development is lacking making what could have been a fantastic, robust and believable world a bit cold and confusing. With that said, I enjoyed the premise and the movie. I just wish that more time had been put into it's crafting to take full advantage of the great premise at hand.

While the film suffered from a few issues, the technical aspects of the film were nice when presented on Blu-Ray. The movie's colors and representation of fleshtones, clarity, etc. were all spot on for the environments the characters were in. The night scenes featured a nice amount of detail on the buildings and in the shadows, lending to the believability of the film.

The soundtrack, DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, was nice and took advantage of all of the speakers. Great off camera cues, spatial dimension and subtle effects made this an overall involving audio mix. The film took advantage of the subwoofer occasionally to create solid, deep, and powerful bass. While much of the film did not require this, it was well done when used. The dialogue was solid and at a good volume in relation to the other effects.

Parents, I would personally peg the movie for a 13 year old, depending on the family. There is some profanity (f word, some s words, etc.), some sexual content involving skinny dipping, There is also plenty of violence, some suicide, and more. While much of this is bloodless, it is something to consider if violence is a concern. There is also some drinking but there is not any use of drugs.

Overall, I really enjoyed In Time. While it suffered from plot flaws and basic premise issues, the film was fun and brought a new concept forward that differed nicely from the average sci-fi film. I wish more time had been spent on this and developing the other characters, but all flaws considered, I would happily watch the movie again as I feel it plays a nice commentary on modern day america, the constant struggle for life, and the class structure.

4419819,2,B004LWZW7E,"If you don't care about thinking, or a movie making sense, or are a sucker for anorexic actors, then this movie might not bother you.
The trailer to the movie intrigued me as a social commentary, so when I sat down to watch this, I was expecting something that was both thought-provoking and action-filled.  Quite a disappointment.  The opening tries to give background on this complex future and it turns out that really what happened is that the screenwriter and/or director thought that a plot that made sense wasn't really important.  So why do people stop aging at 25?  Because the creators of the movie wanted to show off the sexiest, cookie-cutter models and actors they could in one movie.  Only one body type shows off- unhealthily skinny women, and equally unhealthily skinny men with just the right amount of facial hair.  Seriously, this movie looks like an extended Calvin Klein commercial.
The acting isn't great, and it's hard to empathize with either of the lead characters, they just aren't very believable, likable.  Very two-dimensional.  JT should stick with his music or comedy, he doesn't come across as the working-class type.
So I would have been fine if the action was just ridiculous fun.  But it wasn't.  Some car chases, weird arm-wreslting and crappy shootouts.  Not worth my time.",1378425600,,1310,4.936073059360731
4419820,2,B004LWZW7E,"I would agree with the other reviewers in most respects.  I think this is a fundamentally fine idea.  It's obviously a heavy handed metaphor for the evils of Capitalism:  what won't the rich co-opt next?  Here, it's time.  So it's not bloody and not terribly acted, though it isn't well acted, either.

My analysis would lie in large part with the dialogue.  It's lame and stiff.  Now, the director may have made that decision because the society of the era is lame and stiff, but to trot out some old English class stuff, it's ""mimetic fallacy.""  Meaning that, in my weak paraphrase, using the flaws (in this case) to reflect the flaws ...  well, it's not compelling stuff.  I think the film would have been better with stronger dialogue from at least one of the characters.  Being vacuous is not really revealing the vacuous.

I also felt that the use of my town was pretty lame and cliched.  Take the River, for instance.  At least there were no giant ants coming out of tunnels.  But it's not technically where we're at with the River these days.  There was just this typical dystopian feel about the whole set design that annoyed me, it was just way too cliched, but that is a personal predilection.  The romantic sub plot is superfluous and not at all earned from anything else.  And, to parrot a prior reviewer, I really didn't much care about the romantic feelings anyway.  I got more honest emotion out of ""Cowboys and Aliens,"" and that's pretty faint praise.

So I don't think this is a good film.  But it's always easy to criticize from the laptop.  At least the team got the job done, and for that, they deserve respect, if not fanfare.  Sincerity counts.  And craft raises sincerity to art.

My thinking.  It would make an interesting re make/re model down the road apiece.",1378339200,,1786,4.587301587301587

4419825,4,B004LWZW7E,"Andrew Niccol's small oeuvre as a filmmaker deals with pressing contemporary concerns, but usually in an allegorical framework. ""In Time"" is in that vein: in the future, a genetically-modified humanity uses time as money, with the rich potentially immortal, and the rest hardscrabbling for another hour or even a handful of minutes every day. In short, what life is increasingly becoming like for all of us today, as the gap between the 99% & the 1% grows wider & wider -- the poor struggle & die so that the rich live may in obscene comfort.

Niccol begins promisingly by touching on some of the issues such a culture would raise: the anomie & fear of risk-taking that would cocoon the rich, creating a stagnant society averse to creativity & change; the psychological & emotional jarring of having several generations in a family all looking 25 years old; the emphasis on speed & doing things among the poor, leaving no time for contemplation because everything is focused on the next few minutes, rather than on the long-term. So far, so good.

Even the hero-bucks-the-system aspect of the film begins well, as protagonist Will Salas uses an unexpected gift of time given in response to his compassion to challenge the powers-that-be. The problem arises when the film starts becoming too much of a chase/action film. Granted, part of this was obviously intentional, to emphasize the need for people to keep moving constantly, unable to stop & think for any length of time. But I think it was also done intentionally to make the film more blatantly commercial, as the ads emphasized the action, the better to draw in more viewers who don't necessarily want to have to think about what they're watching. This is a delicate balance, and for me it never quite fell into place. I wanted more exploration of the ideas than I got -- though I'll admit that they kept the suspense cranked up quite well. It's just that the film tends to get a bit too slick & glib when it should be evoking a deeper emotional response instead, as Niccol's previous ""Gattaca"" did.

Still, even with that shortcoming, it's a film worth watching & pondering afterwards. The parallels to contemporary life are clear & upsetting, as they're meant to be. If the premise intrigues you at all, then you'll get enough to start you thinking -- on that basis, recommended!",1377388800,,2338,4.79652605459057

Cillian Murphy is great as the jaded detective, Amanda Seyfried tries to get into character but I think she stumbles every now and then, and Timberlake is a good actor, but struggles to acknowledge loss in the way I was hoping.

This movie is basically a Robin Hood of the future type thing. For me the concept really works, but it could have been a lot stronger in parts.

4419887,1,B004LWZW7E,"While the premise of this movie (money is literally time!) is not novel, it is interesting and I looked forward to seeing the movie. Unfortunately, the premise is ruined by the plot -which is absurd and has too many inconsistencies to be taken seriously.

We are told that prices are constantly going up. Yet whenever prices go up, the characters in the movie act shocked. Basically, when their wallet, printed on their arm, goes to zero, they die. Their wallet also ticks down during the day. So, some careful budgeting is required. Yet people routinely cut things to the last second then realize the transportation they need to get home has experienced one of the many previously mentioned price hikes so now they are out of luck.

We are also shown that crime is rampant in the city and you can kill people and take their money from their arm. How much sense does it make that people would be walking around with the equivalent of thousands of dollars of benjamin's taped to their forearms?

But anyway...apparently this advanced society apparently hasn't invented ATM's or paypal or remote money transfer yet. In one hilariously inept scene, Will's mother has only an hour and a half left to live but two hours walk until she can reach Will! (who will give her some more time I guess). So she decides to run. At the same rime, Will realizes something is wrong and starts running down the path towards where she would be. I don't know about you, but I can easily, easily run two hours worth of walking in an hour and a half, and these people are all permanently frozen at age 25 and thus in excellent shape.

In such a future, you would have ATM's sprinkled about and ways for people to transmit and receive money remotely - and in fact, we SEE SOME OF THESE WAYS LATER IN THE MOVIE. But alas, Will's mom dies comically and hilariously right as she flies into Will's arms and before he can give her the handshake of life. Why didn't he just wire her like..20 minutes? We are shown that technology for the remote transfer and tracking of money exists. Every family would have a shared account set up for just situations like this.

The movie also mentions that the constant price increases are a dastardly plot by all the evil rich people to curb overcrowding...these are the very same rich people who apparently let everyone live for free until the age of 25 and then give them a years salary, for free. Needless to say...even if every single person was dragged out and shot at age 25 the population would still keep increasing because of all the sex and child birth and what not that happen during those wild teen years and early 20's. The evil guys evil plan to prevent the world from being overpopulated doesn't even pass the laugh test.

It's hard to take a movie that earnestly tries to present a new vision for humanities way of living remotely seriously with such glaring inconsistencies and plot holes. Suspension of disbelief is fine, internally contradictory and incoherent world building is not.",1372464000,4,3009,4.6360225140712945

There's a giant countdown clock on our arm telling us exactly how many years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds we have left.  We can work to earn more time.  We can give time with others.  We can STEAL time from others.  We can horde time on aluminum blocks that are like bank accounts.  Time is currency, but when you go bankrupt, you're DEAD.  Some are fabulously ""rich"" with more time than they can ever use while most suffer in ""poverty"" with only a day's worth of time to their name.

What could possibly go wrong with a great premise like that???

Here's what: after an intriguing opening and a great first act, this movie disintegrates into mindless car chases, fights, and cliches, and utterly fails to live up to its great potential.  A real shame.

Like when someone says ""In order for a few to be immortal, many must die"" this is like in our world, if a few are to be extremely rich, many must be poor.

I enjoyed what they showed the concept was very well thought out and applied. Live until you are 25 and then you have 1 year of time and you have to earn more and of course everything is paid for with time. I really like that idea.
Maybe some spoilers:
Now the movie it had a slow start and built a good story around what could not be proved as a murder or a theft there was just no evidence. The time police to me really did not present or maybe they do not have to present any solid reason for doing to JT what they did. He did nothing wrong. All of his action where in reaction to what was being done to him.

A problem he was given the 100 odd yrs but he then went on to win a whole lot of more years. So the time police show up and take not only what was given to him but also what he rightfully won. Now I know there would be no movie if this did not happen but I think we could have com up with a better way to get the action moving. That is the major problem that kept this movie from reaching say a Matrix level of WOW. They show how corrupt the time police are right away. Hey we can not prove you killed any one we can not prove you were not given that time freely but we are here and we are just going to take all your time away because we can.

Come on you got the workings for a great story but then you make it so simple that is just lays there no twist no pop just flat there it is we take your time and you run to get more.

4420087,5,B004LWZW7E,"the first time i saw in-time i was just mildly amused, because i didn't pay enough attention. i did notice that the town of new-greenwich is named after the famous place in england where the day starts, or you might say time begins. (greenwich-mean-time) but i'm sure no one else in the theatre even noticed. then the timekeeper leon, (as in ponce-de...) says they'll solve the crime if they ""follow the time"" which is a take-off on the old adage, follow-the-money. again, no laughs in the theater. it's an intelligent movie, and goes right over the heads of most people in the demographic that goes to see sci-fi action.
but one evening recently, i watched it on dvd and got much more out of it. i finally noticed that the working-class town is called ""dayton"", and that the movie is full of double-entendres, sly jokes, and allusions. ""maybe he thought it was a drive-through"", ""you shouldn't have"", and ""we look cute together"".... but some scenes, like when salas tries and fails to save his mother, are actually poignant.
the style of the film helps keep it interesting. the odd colors, the sets, costumes, and and most of the characters are cartoon-like. but this ""unreal"" quality gives it flavor, cachet. if niccoll wanted it to just seem every-day ""real"" he'd certainly have the women kick off those stiletto heels before they run for their lives. also, if you're old enough to remember, the swimming scene is very like, (possibly an open tribute to) logan's run, the other film where implanted time clocks controll the characters.
now, i'm wondering, what more am i still missing?
lastly, and very importantly, like all good sci-fi, it has a message. the movie says pretty loud and clear, that extreme, killing poverty, and extreme, insane wealth are wrong. I agree, and this niccoll is a very good movie maker.",1364083200,,1819,4.814696485623003

4420273,4,B004LWZW7E,"How would the world be if everyone could be immortal?  Scientists isolate the gene which causes aging, so everyone could live forever.  The only problem?  How do we prevent the world from becoming over-crowded?

The answer?  Give each person a finite amount of time.  When it expires, you die, period.  The amount of your life remaining is literally your currency.

This leads to an aristocracy of the ultra-wealthy who have more time than they know what to do with (one person has over a million years stored away), literally.  And the desperate poor, who often live with literally hours left to live.

The movie's plot begins here, with a very poor man whose mother literally dies in his arms.  An act of kindness towards a drunk, depressed but wealthy man, suddenly leaves him very wealthy, as the man freely gives all of his wealth to the main character.

The main character decides to live the good life, but finds the one crime isn't stealing someone else's time (time is transferred by touching arms), but being given some, freely.

From here, without giving away too much, the plot basically is ""newly rich man finds spoiled, beautiful rich man's daughter.  Romance starts.  Newly rich man has riches taken by the Time Police, and him and his beau are now on the run.""

Basically, the movie takes a very interesting concept and uses it to create a good, if predictable action movie.  It portrays a very believable, detailed world.  I enjoyed watching it and watch it again from time to time.

It's not nearly as deep as The Matrix, or destined to become a cult classic (the movie is geared for a mainstream audience) but for a good, futuristic action movie, centered around an interesting concept, this movie delivers a fun experience.",1359849600,,1743,4.769230769230769

This film was the quintessential Bonnie and Clyde meets Robin Hood. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Syfried play an awesome couple battling the corruption of a system run by the rich on the backs of the suffering poor.

4420402,5,B004LWZW7E,"I have watched ""In Time"" on DVD a number of times. At first glance via the trailer, I figured it would be just one of those sci-fi action flicks. Big deal. But then, I saw that it was written, directed, and produced by Andrew Niccol, who also did the films like ""The Truman Show,"" ""Gattaca"", ""S1m0ne,"" and ""Lord of War."" So, I gave it a watch-ahead.

It takes place in the year 2161 when a genetic alteration has allowed humanity to stop aging at 25 but the people are required to earn more time after turning 25 or die within a year. ""Time"" has now become a world-wide currency. There is something called ""Living Time,"" which can to be transferred from individual to individual. And, one can see their own time's availability as displayed on an implant on their arms. So, when that clock reaches zero, you die instantly. The more ""time"" you earn, trade, or even steal, the more you survive. You have to ""pay"" with your ""time,"" such as a bus fare, a meal, a rent, etc.

The society appears to be divided based on how much ""time"" you have. The rich have more time than the ""poor"" whom have to live day to day to keep earning ""times"" or they would die. The rich of course just live their life without worrying about dying and plans to be ""immortals."" You can live up to 105 or 2,000 and still looks like 25.

There is an interesting catch phrase in this film where a ""rich"" character has said to Will (played by Timberlake): ""For few to be immortal, many must die."" That, to me, implies a huge ""time"" or energy drain from the ""poor people,"" who had to die, so that rich can live forever. In the ""poor"" areas, the prices has been increasing enough to the point that the people cannot even pay anything with their ""time,"" so they'd died. The more they die, the ""rich"" endures. That is what Will do not want to have happened - so he sought out to ""drain"" the immortals from their ""time"" and distribute it among the poor (and of course collapse the ""System"" in the process).

This film has that somewhat a typical theme such as hero meets the girl, they are being chased by a bad guy (Timekeeper), who didn't win in the end (there is a twist in this regard), and the hero and the girl moving on together to rob more ""Time banks.""

It may have been based on some science fiction novels or elements, but I've found this film to be interesting. The lesson is, of course, don't waste any ""time"" or letting others to waste/steal yours.",1356739200,,2424,4.353982300884955

4420406,2,B004LWZW7E,"In Time is a dystopic tale of a future where minutes of life have replaced dollars as the world's currency. It's the year 2169 and humans are now genetically engineered to stop aging at the age of 25 when a glowing clock -in their arm- begin counting downs to zero. No minutes means you die. Humans can add more time to their clocks by working, stealing and hustling, but your lunch might cost as much as 30 minutes, and a bus ride 2 hours. Since unlimited time would lead to overpopulation, the corporatist fascist behind the system use ""timing out"" as a way to control population.

Enter Will Salas, an honest hard working 28 street kid (looks 25) who lives with his smoking hot mother (who also looks 25 -talk about awkward). The two live day to day, with less than 24 hours on their arm clocks at any time. Will works at a arm timer factory, where management is shown cheating him out of minutes. One night, at his favorite bar, he saves the life of a suicidal rich guy with more than a century on his arm clock. The rich guy rewards Will by giving a century of life before taking his own. Will than goes to meet his mother, but because she comes up minutes short on her bus fare,  she runs out of time before he can reach her, and times out (dies) in front of him. Will uses his new wealth to go to New Greenwich (where the rich people live)and hustle thousands of years as a poker player. Things turn bad and Will is becomes the murder suspect in the death of the rich guy who gave him the century. His escape involves the kidnapping of Sylvia, the daughter of a minute banking billionaire. The two fall in love and go on a Bonnie and Clyde crime spree.

I have to say the premise of this movie is brilliant, as was the first 20 minutes. But after that it falls apart. It's almost like they wanted to write a serious critique of our economic system, but knew it wouldn't fill theater seats, so they turned it into a Bourn Ultimatum style action story after 20 minutes. So the next 20 minutes consisted of martial arts fight scenes and car chases.  But they didn't seem to know how to keep that action going, so they turned it into a Bonnie-and-Clyde crime spree movie, which seemed like plain old lazy writing to me.  Plus, where does a guy working in a timer factory learn to fight like Batman and play poker like Johnny Moss? Even worse than the structure was the dialogue. I guess the writers wanted us to know that despite the karate punches and car chases, they were making a serious movie about inequality. So they tossed in the lines that sounded like what a 6th grader might say after being brainwashed by Howard Zinn. It was all pretty lame and unconvincing.",1356393600,,2673,4.359437751004016

The acting definitely isn't the best, and there are some parts of the film that drag, but the premise is so intriguing (if unsettling) and the film is shot so well that it makes up for it's downfalls. I thought Timberlake did a fine job as the lead and I found myself thinking I wouldn't be opposed to seeing more of him in future roles. Overall I think the movie could have been much more than what it is, but it was still a fun and interesting flick.

4420486,4,B004LWZW7E,"A movie with great imagination based on ""Time & Life"".  I'm not one for watching movie's with far fetched idea's which is what I thought I was getting into before I watched this one, but I was wrong, this had just enough to keep my interest and made me wonder what it would be like if this was to happen someday. This was action filled, but with a ""Creative and Imaginative"" twist to it, unlike the usual jumping out of airplanes, hitting the ground and still getting up to continue your lunch date without even as so much as a scratch on you.  The thought of using ""Time"" as currency to live is a interesting concept. To be monitored in life by  ""Timekeeper's"" to determine how much time your clock has left. In this movie one must have ""Time"" embedded in their wrist to exist in life, to continue to live, to buy grocery's, to travel or to get to work, everything cost time.  The concept to live in a world which is programmed to  allow life to go to age 25, then one must borrow, steal, or gamble to get  more  time from somewhere or their  time clock will expire and they will die. Justin Timberland plays the role of a young man who lives in a poverty stricken area where TIME is of very little and  trying to survive another day is full time job. His mothers life is in jeopardy simply because she has two hours left on her wrist, her bus fare to get home from work has been changed from 1 hour to 2 hours, she frantically  runs through the streets hoping to find her son (who is played my Timberland) who has time on his wrist and can lend her some. What will come of that...hmmmm, take the time to watch it.  As the movie continues Wil
 (Timberland) sets out to attempt to change the World of Time the best he can . As he is out and about at a local bar having a few suds with some friends, he meets a man who has at least 100 years embedded on his wrist.  Fearing for this strangers life, Wil attempts to tell the man with that much time he will be killed by others if he allows people to see his wrist where the amount of  time is showed. Just as  Wil is explaining  this to the wealthy man,"" Thugs of ""Time Stealing"" come and attempt to steal him of his 100 years. Wil now helps him escape and brings him to safety.  The wealthy man not wanting to have to live his life in constant fear and battle over the value of time, gives Wil all his times as Wil is sleeping  and allows himself only 3 minutes to live.  Wil now having over a 100 years shares his time with those not so fortunate.  Wil goes to the Casinos to gamble  his t6ime in hope to even get more time. His goal to share it with others.  It is there he meets Sylvia ( Amanda Seyfried) the daughter of the wealthiest man of time.  A love story now begins. I  give the acting in this movie  3 stars, the concept 5.  I'm recommending this movie, it makes you to think outside of the box.......... a nice  flick to watch... If you have TIME!",1355788800,,2909,4.129893238434164
4420487,4,B004LWZW7E,"The jist of the story is a rather intrigiung one- that your body is only designed to live 25 years and then a clock is activated on your arm, giving you 1 year to live. The wealthy can practically live forever, while the poor and downtrodden will have their clock's expire.

Now I have a few gripes.

#1. I'm a bit shocked and taken that Hollywood didn't do more with this film- it had so much potential. And Hollywood seems like they are absolutely preoccupied with youth, wealth and anti-capitalism. It would've done justice to depict what would really go down if time were currency, as surely the ""ghetto"" wouldn't be safe. Can young ppl under 25 whose clock hasn't started yet, buy and sell in the marketplace? They should've devoted alot more time to detail!

#2. I feel that Justin Timberlake has outgrown his boy band persona and dog paddled in the actor waters, I do feel that Amanda Syfried dragged him down. I mean, I think he was pulling his role off excellently...that is until Amanda popped into the picture, then the story morphed into a Bonnie and Clyde type love story. It's truly a shame, as this film could've been so much more.

The movie doesn't beat around the bush on the idea of ""class warfare"", and the screenplay writer was clever to make everyone stop aging in their mid-20s. That lets the director cast a bunch of popular actors and actresses, who I think did good jobs.

There's also gratuitous Leonard (from ""The Big Bang Theory"") as Justin's best friend, gratuitously evil Pete Campbell (from ""Mad Men"") as Amanda's dad and the coup de grace--Cillian Murphy playing yet another baddie. Well, actually he's a sort of time cop called a timekeeper, but they are cops basically there to protect the rich.

The clock countdowns and then sudden deaths were shot well. The vacuousness of life for those rich enough to have thousands of years banked was very Gatsby-like. Loved the sound of the cars in the movie (trust me they have some futuristic zoom zoom feature) as well as the whole pseudo Dodge Charger meets Knight Rider look to the timekeeper's cars. The 2169 future was not all shiny and new but mostly concrete and more concrete. It worked for me.

The 'time as currency' concept was very interesting, and I think this would have made a better novel or even a short story. In the movie, there were just too many plot holes, things that made no sense, or were just not explained well. At all.

Why was no one stealing time from others? If it's as easy as touching their hand, you'd see dead bodies all over the place. But things were oddly peaceful in the ghetto. It was even safe enough for a child to sleep outside at night and not be robbed. And how a man could stand on a street corner with a tremendous fortune and not get killed was beyond me. People down to minutes should seem a lot more desperate.

I didn't understand the 'fight' at all. What exactly was difficult about it? Whoever's hand is on top is getting the time. Was there some reason, once someone was on top, that the other guy couldn't use force - or even look like he was *trying* to use force - to turn his hand over?

Why was the girl (I've already forgotten her name) already so jaded? She was only 27. I could see the others, who had lived a hundred years or more, being bored with life. I guess it was the whole 'sheltered, spoiled, rich girl' thing, but it didn't really seem to work.

With police forces spread so thin (it was said that it could be hours before help could arrive for an officer), what was there really to keep people from revolting? There should have been many desperate people. Most really didn't have anything to lose.

I spent the whole time wishing for a bit more insight into how this society was supposed to work, hoping it was coming later. It wasn't.",1349827200,,1829,4.28695652173913

The time they have left to live is seen as green glowing numbers on their arms. In this world where time is literally money, the poor are always struggling for a few more minutes, while the rich have the potential to live for all of eternity. Will Salas unexpectedly hits the jackpot when a suicidal man gives him the rest of his time- over one hundred years. Will soon sees how the other half lives and makes it a mission to redistribute the wealth. He befriends socialite Sylvia Weis, and the two play Robin Hood, emptying the accounts of the rich and giving more time to those in the ghetto. With the Timekeepers on their trail, Will and Sylvia rely on each other to survive.

I thought the premise of this movie was really interesting and was excited to see how it would play out. The first ten minutes or so looked promising but it just went downhill after that. Cillian Murphy was excellent as both a creepy, yet justice-driven Timekeeper. Justin Timberlake was all right in his role. Amanda Seyfried was not great- she always seemed to have the same cool expression on her face. I also thought the movie became inundated with cliches- rich girl/poor boy, Robin Hood, idiomatic expressions- which made most of the movie very predictable. There were also a lot of things that were unclear to me- like wouldn't there be more violence if people could just kill each other for more time? And how did Sylvia know how to shoot a gun so well when she had been protected by bodyguards her whole life? Overall, I was disappointed with the execution of what I thought was a brilliant and original concept.",1347148800,,1707,4.506451612903226

This movie is almost as bad as Tom Cruise 'Eyes Wide Shut'.  I truly hate that movie with a passion.  Don't waste your money or time watching this movie.

4420645,1,B004LWZW7E,"When I first heard about this movie concept I thought, "" How original, must be worth the time."" If anything it was a misuse of time. The movie had a good story idea, ""the need for people to buy time"" because that is what most human beings wish, more time for accomplishments, more time for change, more time to spend with our loved ones, more time for that stressful test and so forth. Unfortunately the movie failed to execute. I had expected to feel desperation in the action, the movie should have been 90 minutes at most. Instead I was desperate for it to be over and was even at the verge of turning it off, which is in itself a bad sign.

What frustrates me the most about this movie is that it could have been great. If you are a person that highly values time I don't recommend you watch this movie, however this movie does serve as a good example of what happens when a potentially good story lacks the necessary components to deliver and I encourage people that would like to study film to watch this movie because you will learn a lot on ""how not to do it.""",1346025600,,1068,4.261083743842365

OK, I can see the points of the negative reviews but c'mon folks, this is a movie..made in hollywood...it aint supposed to be 'sensible'.

But, if you turn off your brain, I think you'll enjoy this movie. I did. Sure, there are tons of stuff that make no sense. Too many to list, but this again brings me back to the point of 'this is a movie...made in hollywood...& thats how many movies go...'UNREALISTIC'...'..But 'unrealistic does not mean unenjoyable.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, I do agree they could have done alot more with the premise of this movie. After all, the premise is quite interesting...Everybody stops aging at 25 & then has 1 more year. TIME IS THE CURRENCY used to buy things, live & die by.....Awesome premise & if they would have turned this in to a 3 - 5 hour movie/mini-series they really would have had ample time to really expand on the premise...but having to fit everything in at a bit under 1 hr 45 min, they did the best they could & although unbelievable with lots of 'plot holes', this was thoroughly enjoyable.

Anyway, no spoliers so let me just say when it comes to movies everybody has different tastes & this movie is no exception. Some will love it, some will hate it but ya know what, you won't know yourself unless you watch it.

I almost didn't due to the negative reviews & only ended up seeing it by 'luck', but I sure am glad I did see it & would love to give it 5 stars as I thoroughly enjoyed it but will knock off 1 star due to the 'plot holes' which honestly are impossible to avoid with the premise of this movie & short run time.

The visuals were great...actors all did a great job....my rec is to ignore the reviews & watch it..You may hate it but you may also love it.

I thought I would hate it & was not even going to waste my time watching it due to the negative reviews....It now resides on my DVR & I've watched it 3 times & still am not bored with it. Its just a 'fun' movie with a very intersting premise assuming you can turn off your brain & just sit back & enjoy it for what it is. It certainly is not 'slow moving'. In fact, the movie flies by pretty fast as there really is no boring parts & its just 'go go go' from beginning to end.

I do see why some hated it & others loved it very clearly. & cant blame anybody if they hated or loved it, as both 'camps' have ample reason to back up why they hated or loved it.

Put me in the camp who loved it. Was it believable? No, of course not, but thats why its a movie...but it sure was 'fun & exciting' & quite enjoyable, imo.",1345852800,,2728,4.151515151515151

Anyone who has studied finance or read Keynes knows that the relation between money and time is very intimate. This movie takes some time to explore those connections and its impact on human behavior. Personally, I liked the sets and costumes, but more importantly, this movie made me think. In many ways, the world ""In Time"" is not that different from ""reality."" If you substituted money for time in this movie, your characters would probably still act the same--selfish, anxiety-ridden, always slightly desperate.

4420731,4,B004LWZW7E,"While I am sure that when a movie is released by a major distributor (e.g. Fox), they must have certain expectations. The film must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Limit the violence. Limit the foul language. And so on.

So we are given poor tech specs: 109 minutes of the film as proper, a few deleted scenes, a 'making of', 5.1 DTS, and subtitles in English and Spanish. Nothing that adds to the value of the BD.

Now the film itself has been 'discussed' from both sides, whether or not this movie can stand on its own. We have what amounts to families with monetary power and those who struggle day by day. This really could have been a good film to throw out and generate awareness of several sociological issues. But this movie is PG-13, so the film makers leave out any real meaningful moral points. This would have been rated R to make it worth while. But do we really want the morality tale?

The acting is kinda wishy-washy. At times, Seyfried seems to have some trouble finding her character. And at times Timberlake thinks he's an action hero. But you know what? If you can get past these points, what is left is an enjoyable film, supposing you can turn off your brain and just go along for the ride. YMMV.",1343952000,,1229,4.405286343612334
4420732,2,B004LWZW7E,"I couldn't resist.  The film certainly didn't.  The script itself is plagued with so many `time' related clichs within the dialog (can you spare a minute, etc.) that it was laughable, which is not something this film was shooting for.

I honestly didn't mean to come on guns blazing in the first paragraph.  I'll lighten up for a second.

`In Time' is a science fiction film about a future time when no one ages over twenty-five.  Sadly, you only actually LIVE till twenty-six unless you're rich.  The currency is time and so the more you owe the less you live.  In order to survive you have to work your fingers to the bone and conserve your `time'.  Will is twenty-eight and lives at home with his mother.  He is a minimum wage worker and his mother, who just turned fifty, works her fingers to the bone as well, and yet they are still living on mere hours, just trying to make enough to get to the next day.  After a bar brawl, Will winds up getting his hands on over a century of `time', but certain events lead him on the run with a beautiful socialite as Time Cops try to restore order by `cleaning Will's clock'.

The idea is interesting.  I mean, it's not `really' interesting, but it could have been promising.  Instead, the film feels rather skeletal, with no real attempt to uncover any depth in the story.  Instead, it's a lot of running around and shooting and whatnot, which doesn't help differentiate this from any other random action thriller.  That, and Justin Timberlake is hard to take seriously.  It's his voice.  It is perfectly suited for the radio, and I happen to love me so `Sexyback' but the feminine nature of his voice makes it hard to take him seriously as an actor, unless his character benefits from that `pitch'.  It doesn't here.  It's not all Justin's fault though, as no one here really manages to deliver a decent performance.  I blame the script for that because these characters are just bland and uninspired.  The set pieces are nice and the editing is sharp so as to create some nicely placed action sequences (and when Will takes revenge on some thugs it was an inspired touch) but other than that this is a borderline bore of a film that never gets proper footing.",1343606400,,2206,4.517676767676767

Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried was in the movie. I think they did a great job. I will admit that sometimes when a big singing star acts in a movie, it is hard for me to get passed that person is a singing star. Automatic strike against them. Well, Justin Timberlake's performance convinced me he was a solid actor and he did a wonderful job. Amanda Seyfried was gutsy and fun to watch. Those two carried the movie well. I thought everyone did excellent actually. I understood the movie's concept. I loved the action sequences. It kept my attention, and honestly, this is the type of movie I would watch if it came on television a thousand times, which some movies do.

4420734,4,B004LWZW7E,"There are more than 200 reviews of this movie and I'll admit I didn't read every one of them.  But after reading 10-20 of them, a pattern begins to form.

Rather than delve into the actors and who IS or ISN'T a good actor, I think overshadows what's the underlying and most important factor here:  The concept of whether this type of societal situation could ever happen?  As you may or may not know, the movie was accused of plagiarizing a short story written by Harlan Ellison.  Long story short (no pun intended), a lawsuit was eventually dropped and everyone moved on their merry way.

Movies like ""In Time"" and others such as ""I Robot"", ""Children Of Men"" and ""District 9"" all speculate about the future of mankind but they all cling to the same premise: that the future is doomed to even worse a fate than we can imagine even in our so called ""modern times"".

At best, these movies are subjective and whether one can enjoy them or not depends on whether or not you buy into their premise.  Personally, I see them all as thought provoking and yet........a form of escapism.  They are a fantasy created by the writer for us to decide either to go along with it or not.

Does ""In Time"" have from a technical, artistic and dramatic point of view, faults and flaws?  Yes of course.  Plenty of people have already spoken to this.

The official description of the story is as follows: in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.'  Plug into this simplistic explanation the fact that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in a time zone equivalent to living on the wrong side of the tracks. He decides to go for the gold and with the help of his buddy Borel (Johnny Galecki) he sets out to cross through all the barriers (using his allotted stored time to buy passage) to get to the wealthy part of town - an area run by the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) and his staff (Alex Pettyfer et at).  Will gains entry into the gambling casinos, bets his hours on Timekeeper at the table, wins, and meets the beautiful Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of the richest man in the city.  From there on it is a `catch me if you can' chase as Will and Sylvia try to outwit the Timekeeper and of course we know who is going to survive.

The dialogue is plebian, the characters, with the possible exception of Will, are only given to us in outline form, so we end up not really caring about anyone.  There are some interesting bits of surrealism tossed in but even those can't alter the fact that there is very little to work with in this little star turn for Timberlake.

Still I enjoyed the overall plot and never got bored. The morality play about the idle rich who live a long time but are not alive versus the poor who appreciate anything they can get really strikes a chord in this country today.

Rich people have many hours, poor people have few. In the slums, filling up your time account is a daily chore. You never get older than 25, physically, as long as you keep your time account affluent. When your time account runs out, you are dead. You time out. You can also always choose to die in a regular manner. Being immortal requires staying away from physical damage and keeping your time account covered. Timing out has become a new mode of suicide, a convenient one.

What really killed this film for me was Amanda Seyfried. I don't know how this girl keeps getting parts. She isn't qualified to act in a local high school stage production, much less a major motion picture. The already terrible ""romantic"" dialogue between her and Timberlake is made infinitely worse by her patent inability to deliver any line without coming off as some sort of parody of the intended material. She should be relegated to b-list chick flicks where all the characters dance around the table blabbering about divorce and empowerment.

A shame. The idea of the movie is interesting, and Timberlake is a solid enough actor. I can't help but think it would have been significantly better with an actress with even a modicum of talent.",1341446400,2,965,4.772455089820359

It's a decent action movie with a few movie cliches.  Like when Will and his mom are running to meet each other before she ""times out,"" then the cliche is repeated again later on as he and Sylvia are running to each other before she ""times out."" My favorite was the James Bond throwback where Will is playing poker. He intro's himself, ""Salas. Will Salas.""  All in all the movie turns into a sort of Bonnie and Clyde story in which Will and Sylvia are robbing banks containing what I guess could be dubbed ""time capsules.""  I believe the movie at its core is an anti-corporatist/antibanker movie as Sylvia's dad is owner of a large national bank and they refer to his time as being stolen time. It's stolen in the sense of taking it from the people to make themselves rich, but giving it out to look like they're not, such as ""time loans"" and time printing (inferred, but not seen in practice.)  Also everybody works to gain time and the inflation is referenced as only happening in the ""ghetto"" and the idea is to kill the poor people while the rich keep on living. For a couple of hours to spare it's not a bad movie, but does have some sort of anticapitalist/socialist message to it about evil business owners sucking the people dry while we should be freely ""sharing"" and redistributing the wealth.""  Not exactly my philosophy since I believe in a truly free market (Austrian economics style) regulated only to protect the surrounding environment and people from the abuses of bad business, but it makes for a good story otherwise.",1341446400,,1797,4.649842271293376

In the future through the miracle of science everyone is engineered to stop growing old after the age of 25, but only live 1 year past said age unless they buy time by working or the case of the bad guys here they steal it from people to keep on living. In other words, when your clock reaches 0:00, you're dead.

When a hard working man named Will Salas (Justin Timberlake, ""Black Snake Moan"") doesn't get all the time he feels he worked for, he goes to a club and helps a drunk Henry Hamilton (USA's ""White Collar"") who has lots of time on his hand (I mean that literally since their life clock is displayed on a person's arm).

Said drunk gives Will his time while he's asleep then jumps off of a bridge and dies face first in a creek, so Will now has all the time in the world (bad pun I know). First he gives some to his best friend then his mother dies right before he's about to give her more time. Once Henry is fished out of the creek some agents of sorts (one is Cillian Murphy, ""Batman Begins"") and they start to follow the trail of time.

From here on out its Will eluding the agents, heading to the capital to bring them down, oh and there's a beautiful rich woman (Amanda Seyfried ""Red Riding Hood"") who comes along with him on his mission. There's some good action, Timberlake makes for a good hero, Seyfried is simply stunning and Murphy is quite unlikeable as the villain.

While the concept is good, the rest of the film is pretty basic and kinda just drags on in parts and the film overall is predictable. Sure it looks good, cool effects and all that, but its pretty hollow and dull in all other areas. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",1341100800,3,1664,4.26984126984127

The rich have plenty of time to live, but others struggle to stay alive in this show which is what brings us to the plot. Will Salas(JUSTIN TIMBELAKE) is hunted down for killing a man he didn't kill. When found he takes a hostage named Sylvia Weis(AMANDA SEYFRIED) who soon becomes his partner in stealing time from banks and other places and sharing it with everyone.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Okay so somehow ALL the nations of the world decided to change currency to time.  Really?  We can't even get all the nations of the world to agree on where to hold the Olympics without it devolving into an argument that goes nowhere and ends up being investigated by a committee that's filibustered until it dies in a sub-committee.  And somehow ALLLLLL the nations of the world said, ""Yes, let's get rid of monetary standards and currency that we've used for hundreds of years, re-write the DNA of the ENTIRE population of the planet so they die at 26 unless they work and get more time.""

Also, we're still arguing about cloning and we've been arguing about that since like the 90's and we're STILL no closer to resolving that argument, but somehow this got approved on a GLOBAL scale and put into effect.  And NOBODY said, ""Wait a minute... what are we doing again?"" NOBODY said, ""Wait a minute, this is COMPLETELY unconstitutional and TOTALLY violates human rights and is COMPLETELY unbalanced and favors the rich in every way shape and form, this can't be allowed!""

Okay well I can move past that and get to the rest of the things in this movie that were stupid.

So this main character, has a secret to success!  He let's his own clock run down to a few seconds when he's in a fight so the other person doesn't pay attention to their own clock on their arm, so that's when he makes his move.  And NO ONE else on the planet has figured this out?  Sure, why not?  On top of that he's in a high stakes poker game and he's playing for like a 1,000 years or something as the wager and he is down to his last few seconds and the rich guy is like, ""Looks like you're all in...""  And he reveals his cards.  Okay, first of all, anyone with half a friggin' BRAIN in their skull would see that and think, ""Okay I just have to stall for a few seconds, he'll be dead and I get to take the pot.""  All he'd have to do is look at his cards, put on his ""thinking face,"" and say, ""gimme a minute, hmmm... let me see... what should I do... hmmm... *THUD* What happened?  He's dead?  Oh, guess that means I win!""

So Will decides that he is going to take down the system with the help of the rich guy's daughter who is played by Amanda Seyfried, and frankly I think she did a pretty decent job of playing her character in this movie.  And their secret to taking down the system is to crash a car into a bank and steal the time there.

Really?

This time currency system has been going on for probably over 100 years now and they just NOW figured out the concept of robbing a bank?  They just now figured out, ""Hey, we want what they have, we have some guns, let's go in there, wave our guns around menacingly and threaten to shoot them if they don't give us what we want and then take what we want!""  It took the people of this planet over 100 years to figure that out!?!  The human race figured that crap out back in the Stone Age!  Some guy was squatting in a cave somewhere and said, ""Ogg hungry, Gorg have food, Ogg want food, Ogg take Gorg's food!""  And now hundreds of thousands of years later these people just now rediscovered this concept?  Plus there's no guards there?  Again, these intelligent human beings that run these banks don't think, ""Hey we've got some stuff here that is valuable and other people want it.  Maybe we should put some, oh I don't know... GUARDS with WEAPONS in here that can defend the place in case someone breaks in and tries to rob the place, we can fight them off and protect the valuable things we have!  No one thought to do this!?!

The movie ends with these two characters walking into something that looks like it might be the Federal Reserve and they each have pistols with them.  I was thinking, ""I'm pretty sure this place will have more security than that two-bit bank branch that you robbed in the ghetto.""  But I guess that would require the writer of this to THINK.

And what if most people had a 24 hour living period and had to renew it every day thereafter with services and the like? In essence buying your life had become the new currency of the world and there were also people thieving and conning others out of their mostly hard earned time? This dystopian setting focuses on such possibilities taking an interesting look at aging and generations basically fading away as everybody stays at one age over their lifetime(s). Timekeepers serve the powerful by making sure people stay to their segregated zones and never get ahead in life points. Everybody has a time clock on their inner forearm that clicks their life down to the last second.

There's some comparison nods to the Occupy Wall Street movement, I suspect, as speeches are made about equal time payments for all rather than a few hoarding everything. A lot of interesting ideas but not nearly mined fully enough and some ideas don't make much sense or have serious plot holes. Amanda Seyfried, Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy and Vincent Kartheiser are some of the notables in the picture. Seyfried felt very much underutilized and some of the dialogue was so mediocre at times that I wondered if this was intended mainly for the adolescent movement. Bad move, marketing people.

4420871,4,B004LWZW7E,"I gotta say, In Time intrigued me with its neat concept of time as currency and also as a person's own life clock. I agree with some of the other reviews that say the concept was great but the execution was poor. It could have been so much better.

Some of the areas that they could have focused on more or better:

1. Fleshing out characters. They kept mentioning characters without going into enough detail to make them seem important to audience members or even the main characters themselves. For instance, the main character Will Salis (played by Justin Timberlake) mentions his father once or twice and talks about his father with this timekeeper, the cops of this world, but these ""conversations"" are all hints at what his father did and how significant he was. The way the story was going, I expected that the main characters would discover this big conspiracy related to Will's father and then Will would avenge him by succeeding where he failed. Will mentions that he thinks his father was killed, but then there was no truth uncovered about it.

Another example is the main ""bad guy"", the father of Amanda Seyfried's character, Sylvia. He is this rich tycoon who wouldn't spare a cent for his own daughter for the sake of the time ""markets."" He has conversations with mysterious people about the markets and seems like he's the head honcho of everything. There were multiple opportunities to show just how ruthless he was, like this scene where his wife says that he ""suffocates the family"" with his imposing will. That was a perfect opportunity for him to exercise his power by punishing his wife somehow.

They just kept setting things up but not really explaining anything.

2. Stealing time is reaaaaaally easy. After a while, Will and Sylvia team up to steal time from the rich to give to the poor a la Robin Hood. Despite how valuable time is (people kill for a week in the ghetto), all of the time banks have really no security at all. Will and Sylvia get away super easily, even when stealing from Sylvia's father who employs many guards but has one number combination for his huge vault, containing 1 million years. Not even an eye or thumb scan? Weak.

3. Will Salis is super badass. This guy who grew up in the ghetto, literally fighting for his life everyday, somehow is highly trained in driving, shooting, and being James Bond. I can understand that he's scrappy and resourceful, but they make him look like a freaking professional!

4. I think one of the other reviewers mentioned this but the ghetto is really not that bad. They're just poor. The living conditions don't seem too awful other than people dying in the streets every day or so. But for such a horrible place, people are wearing decent clothing, the streets are clean, and no one seems desperate for time, despite living ""day to day."" In fact, other than the mob boss who runs around cleaning people's time with his lackeys, people seem downright decent in the ghetto.

Anyways, despite some of these shortcomings, it's worth a watch, if just to see what this movie could have been, had it been better written and executed. I actually liked it for the entertainment and for the fact that I could stick my arm out and ask my friend to pay me in time. :D",1338163200,,3242,4.626086956521739

I went in expecting little and came away floored, and also ashamed of myself from expecting so little. All of the other reviews sum up the plot, actors, and everything else just fine. The only tidbit I feel compelled to add is that your own trials in life and your perception of monetary resources (which time is, in this film) will greatly influence how you perceive this film. I've scrapped and scraped my entire life. Because of that, In Time grabbed me and I wasn't able to blink until the end credits came up.

4420875,4,B004LWZW7E,"The first thing that came to mind when this started was Logan's Run, written many years ago by an old friend. I think George would have loved this, not just for the clever plot that borrows only his most essential concept, which was very PK Dick to begin with, but for the heart at the core of this tale.

The acting is mostly decent, especially Murphy, and the script falters only now and then with its overuse of merely fair wordplay. But it's the overall premise that keeps this going, being so very close in essence to what's going on in today's world.

Yes, this is in fact really a critique of our banking system, and greed in general (New Greenwich is clearly a play on Greenwich, where so many of the Wall Street scumbags live in 100-million dollar homes, paid for by money stolen from our 401ks, and of course those wonderful Obushma bailouts). Just like Niccol's classic Gattaca, the social criticism here is nicely wrapped up in a plot that doesn't hammer the moral home every minute, but by the end you see the injustice very clearly.

Timberlake is almost great, but he's still a few films away from the subtlety and quiet power he could have brought to this role. Nonetheless, he's pretty good, all told, and keeps the movie moving through its various twists and turns.

The blu-ray has a very nice transfer but doesn't really need it, as the sets are pretty downtrodden to begin with. But the arm clocks are a nice device, and the good docs on the film show the ink dots that were there during filming, and you see how very nicely done the clock effect was. The idea really is great, though of course in reality the time banksters would know where every single until came from and went to. Details like that should be thought of ahead of time, but oh well, at least I will neither die at 25 or live forever, both quite unsavory prospects.

Still, this movie has such an interesting premise, that I wanted to spend some ""time"" sharing my thoughts about it.  I'm a huge Matt Bomer fan (""White Collar""), and to a lesser extent, Cillian Murphy fan.  Cillian Murphy, the Timekeeper, plays a dynamic role.  You get that he can't resolve the inconsistencies of the system that he has spent the last 50 years of his life maintaining, yet like Mr. Stevens, the butler in Remains of the Days, you can tell that he has moments of real doubt whether he has wasted his life in his particular form of servitude. Yet he cannot fully admit to himself that he misspent his life, nitpicking the seconds and minutes of the poor and disenfranchised, while the wealthy can afford to loiter indefinitely. The Timekeeper has the integrity to not be paid off by billionyear, Mr. Weis, yet the Timekeeper still cannot fathom another way around the current status quo.  He is nonplussed when Will gives him enough time to spare his life.

It was refreshing that the ghetto wasn't racially or ethnically segregated, just financially segregated.  A blonde-haired man with a posh British accent was the most menacing gangster in this ""wrong-side-of-the-toll"" Time Zone.

I suppose in heaven we'll never age beyond late young adulthood, but in the here and now, it would be very strange to see different generations looking exactly the same age; therefore, no visibly aging actor was featured in this movie.  I haven't seen ""Logan's Run,"" but that movie apparently has a similar theme.

This movie doesn't really offer solutions, but rather points out how problematic it is for the few privileged to live at the expense of the many underprivileged. This excessive wealth and out-of-proportion longevity doesn't even really make these privileged few happy, as Matt Bomer's character, Henry Hamilton, attests before he times out. If we could all live agelessly, there would be issues of scant resources and overpopulation, yet as I chronically pester my Facebook friends, if we all went whole foods-based vegan, that could help prevent and reverse human starvation, as imported grain (now being forced fed to animals) could be redistributed to humans (i.e., a higher quality version, along with dried beans), and animals can graze on indigestible-to-humans grass, including grass clippings during the winter. (I only recently learned that the meat industry is a huge contributor to human starvation; I went veg b/c I love animals and could no longer pretend it was okay to love my companion pets while hypocritically eating meat from animals who likewise have feelings and are sentient.) This movie subtly (or perhaps not-so-subtly) preaches a dictum I first came across on a bumper sticker: ""Live simply so others can simply live.""",1335830400,,2937,5.1

I found it interesting that the movie protrayed time as being more valuable than life itself.  If it were to really happen, then there probably wouldn't be over-population - just slavery.  I liked the movie, because it was entertaining and it raised a whole bunch of new questions about how low humanity could go.  It's not a chick flick so go ahead and watch it, and be glad it doesn't take too much of your time (life) to watch it.",1335744000,,530,4.43298969072165
4421097,4,B004LWZW7E,"After watching the movie In Time, you tend to wonder what if our world today ran like that also? Where time truly is money and that you literally have a certain period of time to live. That's not even half your lifetime and you have so much more to live for. You can definitely say that In Time reflects the dystopian ideals because the society is divided into social classes of the rich and the poor. A dystopian society represents different kinds of repressive social control systems and the societies within the dystopian worlds often explore the concept of humans abusing technology. Societies are often pictured as police states with unlimited power and control over the citizens. Just like a dystopia, the society set within In Time has this social class for the rich and poor called Time Zones, and for those who live in the poor have to work every single day just to earn a few more hours to live. And if your clock reaches zero you die automatically. However, for the rich they have unlimited time and usually live for centuries. Everyone looks young because for those who are unfortunate only live 25 years. The use of technology is used throughout the whole film because they use an internal clock that controls their whole body. I believe that the use of technology was ultimately abused because it was used in a way to control the matter between life and death for humans. While watching the film it really made me think about how unnatural it was to use technology as a new way of controlling someone's life, and it definitely was abusing technology because I believe it should be used in a way to help us progress in our future, not end it. Automatically you can tell everything was different within the society now that time really was a major issue. You were paid with time and not money, which also really shocked me because your time was your money and everything you need, your time was involved. Money was not needed anymore for this new world. As the police usually have the power within a dystopian society, the police in the movie also had the power and control over the citizens. The police in the movie mad sure that everything ran smoothly and was in its right place. When the police found out that someone was giving more time than they were suppose to, they quickly acted on that and treated the citizen as a victim in the society. Reasons for this was because they wanted to make sure that those who lived in the poor stayed there, and living in the poor was the fastest way for people to die.

4421098,5,B004LWZW7E,"The concept behind In Time was amazing. Instead of running on money the people run on time. I found this really ironic because the way we make money is through time, and I think that is something the writer wanted to make very clear to the audience in this intense theoretically dystopian future. Instantly I felt connected to the protagonist Will, always searching for time yet always giving away time as well. The way we run around constantly complaining about how we don't have enough hours in the day, really seemed to be the general theme of it. The society created in the film really embodied a total dystopian society. The System is in complete control of the people, leaving no time for justice. The timekeepers following Will and admit that they have no cares or worries about justice. The system keeps everyone believing everyman for himself and aspires to survive be Darwin's fittest. They people live day by day and in the end want to be the people with the most time and that is why the system is able to maintain its control. The people follow the system because it is all they know. Some people don't even know the system is corrupt, because they see it through blind eyes. The female protagonist Sylvia is a perfect example of the deception the system uses on the people with the time/power. Sylvia is given everything from her father and knows how he does business, but because it is or her family and he what she knows she accepts the corruption as normal. She believes they are free to be or do or have anything because the lifestyle they live is all she knows. Even after she starts to trust will, she still continues to have that want for time, the want that she and will are trying to fight. Although the characters have freedom of most choice, they are still under control of something much more manipulative and controlling than the bureaucracy, technology.  The humans them selves have become pieces of technology. The numbers on their wrists run electronically and are connected to a huge database system. Machines run everything including the humans. The scary idea that the machines are in charge completes a complete scene of dystopia. The people only know what they are taught but they do not look outside the box because they believe they are already so advanced through the technology that controls and runs them. They are also not very free because the people are constantly under video surveillance no matter where, when or why they go giving the machines and the people behind them the control. The citizens have been dehumanized by their constant connection to technology.  They live day by day in an illusion that they are in a comfortable state. The segregation of different age wealth districts, have left the people in fear of other people and places, also keeping the technology in control. In a struggle day by day for time will embodies the hero that can change it all. The film was inspiring and eye opening to certain aspects of our somewhat near dystopian future.",1335744000,,3009,4.718631178707224
4421099,4,B004LWZW7E,"There is no denying that ""In Time"" is a great a portrayal of a dystopian society. As viewers we are brought into this world where time is the equivalent to currency. So, everything that would cost money in today's society (house payment, a cup of coffee, et cetera) costs time off of a person's life in the society portrayed in ""In Time"".  Once you run out of time, you die. This concept mirrors that of a caste system often depicted in dystopian societies, because the bourgeoisie has an endless amount of time whereas the proletariats struggle by the minute to gain time to their life. The standard of living is much higher and materialistic for the small upper-class population than that of the large lower-class population.

  The premise of this society is to avoid aging. Everyone lives free of the worry of time until they are twenty-five years old, then they have one year to live unless they accumulate or spend more time. This is a good, yet exaggerated representation of what our society today can become. Most people worry constantly about aging, not only for looks but for their health too. ""In Time"" brings to life the issue of the drastic measures we are willing to take in order to live forever in the prime of our life. Also, this movie focuses on the reality of how we spend each second of our lives. It brings about the importance of how valuable our time is.  Although there isn't a detailed back story of how the society came to be this way in the movie, it is assumed that the majority of the population felt that their looks and health are more important than living life the way humans are meant to. Because of this drastic change in how humanity works, the upper-class citizens rule the society. They control the corporations, money, and the cost of living. This is another typical concept found in a dystopian society. A dystopia more often than not has a strong emphasis on the control of those in power.

  Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, a poor man struggling to keep both himself and his mother alive. He begins to question how society works when he rescues a man that is rich in time.  He learns that the reason why prices and taxes have been increasing in his neighborhood is because the bourgeoisie have control and want to kill off the poor because no one can live forever or else there would be overpopulation.  Naturally, Will Salas is the protagonist of the movie with the goal of overturning the way society is run, a typical goal of protagonists in dystopian societies.

  Overall, the concept of this movie is very intriguing and hits home in terms of how real the concept of time as currency is in our lives. Its portrayal of a dystopian society is great. It has important aspects of the building blocks that make a dystopian society such as a caste system, a dramatic shift in power, somewhat of a back story leading to a change in societal norms, and a protagonist that questions those in power. I would recommend ""In Time"" to anyone looking for a movie with a fresh and clever take on a dystopian portrayal.",1335744000,,3055,4.59375
4421100,3,B004LWZW7E,"In Time is a futuristic movie where time has literally become the currency for society.
The people in the society have to find ways to earn their time in order to subsist or else they die
once they ""run out of time"" on their imprinted watches once they turn twenty - five. Since the
time also functions as currency, the people have to use that time to buy food, money and other
necessities all the while worrying about how much time they have until they cease to exist. In
Time does a pretty good job representing dystopian ideals but is a bit idealized as a movie.

 The movie reflects dystopian ideals by having the society split into two: the ghettos
where the bottom of the society preside and the luxurious city - like area where the rich preside.
The people from the ghettos struggle to earn enough time to subsist but the people from the
luxurious city - like area live their days without a worry about time. The dystopian society
functions in a similar way where there is the bottom of the society(majority of the population)
whom struggle to maintain a living and the top(minority of the population) who have more than
they even need to live. The society of In Time maintains a control on the bottom class of the
society by never allowing them to have the ability to get out of their own time zone and even if
they were able to become a little richer, the prices of goods would just raise in order to maintain
the large gap between the two classes, which reflects dystopian ideals.

 The movie also reflects dystopian ideals by having the currency actually become time.
Because currency represents time, the people from the ghettos have to constantly struggle in
order to live another day all the while having to pay for food and other necessities that also
contribute to survival. The society has exerted a kind of control on the people in this society by
having them constantly worrying about their own time that they can't worry about anyone else's,
save the people they are really close to such as family members and close friends. Throughout
the movie we see the occasional dead bodies in the ghettos that the people cannot feel sorry for
as the people are constantly worrying about their own time and how they are going to get
through the day. The dystopian society also maintains a control on the people by having them
become less sympathetic to those around them as the people have to worry about how they are
going to get through the days as well because time is essentially money - even if time isn't
currency in the dystopian society, money is needed in order for that time to really be worth
having.

 However, the movie is also a bit idealized. It seemed so easy for the two main characters
Will and Sylvia to rob the time banks so easily and distribute it among the people of the ghettos.
Usually in the dystopian fiction ""resistance is futile"" - the ones who try to go against the
dystopian society will usually be caught and punished. In all honestly I was expecting an ending
where the two protagonists would be caught eventually and the society would have been what it
always was. The ending was a bit idealized where the people in the ghettos were actually able to
escape their own time zones and the two protagonists were able to actually make a change in the
system of the society.

 All in all, In Time is a movie that reflects the dystopian ideals. The film's society in this
is split into two: the few very rich and many very poor, which is how the dystopian society is
usually structured and also shows how the people in the ghettos have become less sympathetic to
those who also suffer the same fate as them. However, the film is also a bit idealized with how
easy it was for the characters to rob the time banks without having to suffer in the end. In Time
would have been a very good dystopian film if not for its idealizations.",1335744000,,3865,4.511428571428572
4421101,4,B004LWZW7E,"The acting, while not top par, was enough to sell it for me.

While the concept of time as money makes for a great film, I feel the In Time missed the mark in execution.

The cast is stellar but it is the story here that stands out. I especially liked Niccol's metaphor with the usage of time in the film -- with time representing money and the manipulation and exploitation of this heavy demand put upon the general public in the film.

I've never quite seen a movie like this before.  They had to create their own new world, which is always a challenge, like ""Inception"", ""Watchmen"", ""Edward Scissorhands"" (not saying this film is anything like those, but it tackles a surreal idea and bases it in our reality).  The film is a love adventure, racing against time, freedom, and death with a ""Natural Born Killer""/""True Romance"" type of ""love conquers all"" relationship.  None the less, I feel with a script like this you're always trying to find the holes and I do have to say, the holes are slim and far in between.

4421173,5,B004LWZW7E,"I liked Andrew Niccol's ""Gattaca"" and ""The Truman Show"" allegories and I like ""In Time"" as well. It is a dystopian ""Brave New World"" type of future, dealing with the corrupt nature of banking and how the oppressed peasant sheeple might finally wake up to their servitude, to an evil bankster oligarchy, and rebel.

Actually what our current evil bankster oligarchy appear to have planned, in terms of a massive sheeple cull and how they plan to control the remaining sheeple herd through RFID type technology, is probably even worse than this ""In Time"" allegorical warning. ""Worse"" in that the banksters could simply steal ""money units"" from the individual ""bank accounts"" and track dissident individuals with ease, making any kind of ""In Time"" type of rebellion against the ""Panopticon Bankster System"" impossible. Reference Aaron Russo (RIP) and the Nick Rockefeller interview.

As H.G Wells noted in his ""The New World Order"" (WW2 era) warning: ""In the technically crude past, the illiterate Have-nots were sweated and overworked. It was easy to find toil to keep them all busy. Such surplus multitudes are wanted no more. Toil is no longer marketable. Machines can toil better and with less resistance."" So it is hard for me to see why, in the future, the evil oligarchy would even need this hypothetical oppressed slave class of worker drones, desperately trying to ""buy time"" to stay alive another day. Zbigniew Brzezinski: ""It's easier to kill a million people...than it is to control them.""

The idea that a ""forever young"" oligarch might get tired of life after more than 100 years of healthy luxury life, at the expense of a hypothetical slave class rushing around trying to accumulate enough minutes to stay alive, was very well made. Human souls might well ""live to regret"" trying to live forever in this current kind of body vehicle. The limited human body life cycle has the benefit of being long enough (at say 70 - 100 years) for a soul to learn quite a lot before the body vehicle finally breaks down and the ""driver"" is forced to leave the vehicle. A body vehicle that did not eventually break down (naturally) might indeed become rather boring and soul destroying after a while.

The idea that a much loved daughter of an evil bankster might ""see the light"" and want to destroy the evil bankster system was also interesting I thought.

4421287,4,B004LWZW7E,"I found that this movie left a lot to be desired (I agree with many of the flaws other reviewers commented on) but I still think it deserves 4 stars because of the social commentary prevalent throughout the plot. The world is such a hard place to live in, and the division between the rich and poor is disastrous. What made this movie so compelling is that, when time is the currency instead of paper money (or credit), everything becomes even more desperate. When the rent or some other bill is due and you don't have the time to pay for it, you don't owe someone or go into the red. You die. It really makes the concept of ""running out"" much more clear.

One thing I found disturbing was the huge group of people that quit their jobs when they suddenly ""came into"" currency. One, if they're that irresponsible and spontaneous, they probably won't budget their time very well. Two, a good number of rich or well-off people think if they can make it, anyone can. And that is just not true. There always has to be someone left to do the menial, ""unskilled"" jobs. SOMEONE has to clean and do the dishes. Even millionaires' homes would become landfills if there were no garbage collectors. How could they buy the things they wanted without cashiers? They would starve without farmers. (I don't even want to mention those poor people who work in sanitation plants.) That is why EVERYONE deserves a living wage. Screw the minimum wage.

And that's why this movie was so fascinating. People treated time exactly the way people currently treat money. Nothing had changed. The behavior of the rich hadn't changed. A good number of them went about their frivolous lifestyles having no idea what goes on on the other side of the tracks. The behavior of the poor hadn't changed. They worked day in and day out and never got ahead.

I think the movie could have been more detailed and brought up a few more issues. Like most people, I think the way they ""transferred"" time was way too simplistic. Being able to steal someone's time simply by grabbing their hand is just silly. It made picking a pocket seem difficult. That was definitely the biggest flaw of the movie. I really didn't like what happened to the mother of the main character either. The fact that he missed her by like four seconds when he had a century to spare was just over-dramatic.",1333238400,,2339,4.564285714285714

I'm a big fan of The Matrix Films and Deus Ex video games. So if you're into that sort of thing, I suggest you at least look it up and see if you're interested in it. I do agree with a lot of reviews, the movie does leave things to be desired, more about how the time currency came into play is really one that stands out to me.

I was disappointed.

Really powerful theme that time is currency. It brings extra meaning to the old chestnut of ""live each day like its your last!""

And that's how we meet Justin Timberlake's character: Will Salas. He literally lives as each day is his last as he ""earns"" 24 hours of time from his daily efforts in his job. As an aside, Timberlake does a really good job in this movie and is definitely one of its key positives.

But other than Timberlake there aren't too may other positives. The movie moves quickly which is good but lacks real integrity. When it is so easy to rob someone of time (just lock your arm in theirs) it should have been far grittier and frightening rather than the overly ordered, almost robotic depiction of the future shown here.

It may have looked interesting but the movie itself has got to be one of the worst movies ever! The acting is terrible with the exception of Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Inception, and Red Eye). I thought that Justin Timberlake just wasn't believable. For example, He showed emotions but they were the wrong emotions for the wrong scenes. (SPOILER ALERT)When Will's mom died it looked like he was laughing instead of crying. In another scene where he's talking to Sylvia he says how he will make them (The Rich) pay for the loss of his mom. That line alone is just a hilarious line(Unintentionally) worthy of being in a comedy, not a so-called sci-fi thriller. Also let me talk about the action. The action sequences were few with the few shootouts (and an unbelievably fake car crash) that there were looked cheesy due to the fact that the guns looked unbelievably fake. I might also add to the fact that in one scene Will Salas says that he wants to balance out the system so that the poor are just like the rich. He's saying that he wants everybody to be equal. Know what does that sound like to you.  You guessed it Communism. So in conclusion Andrew Niccol (The Director, Writer, and producer) put in his movie recipe communism, a dash of socialism, cheesy looking guns, bad acting(except for Cillian), and of course some sexual situations, and some strong language.

Justin Timberlake was VERY good in this and Amanda Seyfried has come a long way since Mean Girls. In the future, people have a time clock on their arm and when they turn 25 years old, it turns on with a time on it of 1 year which counts down each minute and they never physically age past that point. People can use the remaining time on their arm to buy things and can work to receive more time on it, but when the time runs out, they die. There are time zones which are basically areas of poverty and the smaller numbered time zones are the wealthy people that have been alive for at least 100 years with centuries more to go, so basically they live forever while the poor struggle with the small amount of time they were given and are put at a disadvantage to never move up in life from the time zone they live in.

However, it didn't quite start out that way. In the middle of the opening credits the screen went black, i pulled myself off of the couch and dragged my body to the tv ( i don't have any feet in case you are wondering why i didn't just walk). I thought that maybe i had gotten some chocolate M&M residue on the dvd when i put it in causing it to malfunction (i love candy, especially M&Ms and had just finished my third bag). At the very moment i was about to press eject i heard a tapping on the screen of my Westinghouse...it was JT. ""How about some M&Ms for me, brah?"" he said. ""I'm a-a-ah all out."" i stammered. I was in shock, this CLEARLY wasn't part of the movie. At first i thought i p'd him off, he made a mean face as he rubbed his belly like he was starving and had really needed a choch-fix, but then he did a little spin move and said smiling, ""No biggie smalls..I'm not hungry anyways, I just had a smoothie. Hey, wanna dance?""  ""Sure"", i said ""but, i aint gots no feets, my man!"" (in my old timey black voice). ""Let me worry about that, my friend."", he retorted as he reached thru my tv, took me in his airbrushed arms and pulled me into what i can only assume was Heaven or Magic Land. Almost instantly my stubs were replaced with a pair of sparkling dancing shoes that sparkled like sparklers. We shook what are mammas gave us for nearly an hour, took a break (watched Alpha Dog, which was too awful for words..poor Johnnny Staccato, i hope dead people can't see the films of their kids) and then danced some more. Eventually, the night had to end. My sparkle shoes wouldnt last forever, JT had to get back  doing his ""thang"" and to be honest after sitting thru Alpha Dog i really wanted to go home and watch Killing of a Chinese Bookie again..was i wrong in thinking John was a talented filmaker? How can an apple fall so far? Well, to wrap it up JT put me back into my living room, then from the otherside of Magic Land he reached into his pocket, pulled out my secret stash bag of M&Ms and waved um in my face as the screen went black. Yup, i DID have another bag and JT zoinked um, but guess what? Joke is on him..those weren't the treats he expected.

4421354,3,B004LWZW7E,"The subject of time and immortality has had a long standing tradition in science fiction. Perhaps the most famous of late was the 1976 film LOGAN'S RUN where people died voluntarily on their thirtieth birthday. So it only seems natural that the subject of time would once again come to the forefront in sci-fi as it does with IN TIME.

In the future humans have been genetically altered to stop aging at on their 25th birthday. The problem is when they hit that age they only have so many hours left to live. Embedded in each person is a digital readout on their arm that shows how long they have. To gain more hours you must work to earn them. This means those on the low end of the scale must work to pay for their daily needs like food and shelter. It also means that when their clock reads 0 they die.

Existing in this world is Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a factory worker trying to make ends meet while living with his mother (Olivia Wilde). She has just turned 50 and it may take viewers a second to realize that when he kisses this woman it's his mom not a girlfriend. Remember, you stop aging at 25.

Due to celebrate her birthday after work, Will stops by a bar with his friend to find a stranger passing out free drinks with nearly a century of time on his arm. When the local hood and his gang attempt to rob him of his time, Will helps him escape. The man is Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) and he and Will talk about time. He explains that for there to be time for the upper crust to live they have to take it from someone else. Tax hikes and higher prices are just ways for the rich and famous to live longer at the costs of those below them. While hiding out overnight, Henry passes along his hours to Will telling him to use them wisely.

Will tries to reach his mother but things don't work out as planned. She's just paid off her latest loan with less than an hour left and it costs 2 hours to ride the bus. On the street near home she and Will head towards each other but just as they are about to meet, she collapses, her time out. Now Will decides to take the time problem to its source, the wealthy.

Staying at fine hotels and buying a fast car, the world of the rich is different. No one hurries as they have all the time in the world. But Will can't help himself. It's this fast paced lifestyle that singles him out as the Timekeepers, police who handle time crimes, come looking for him led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy). Will ends up at a casino where he wagers all his time against a wealthy businessman named Philipe Weiss (Vincent Kartheiser), a wager that Will wins resulting in an invitation to Weiss home.

At the party Will meets Philipe's daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and the two are attracted to one another. But Sylvia also finds herself attracted to the differences she finds in Will having no idea where he is actually from. When the Timekeepers show to arrest Will, he takes Sylvia hostage and heads home.

What follows is a transformation of Sylvia as she sees how others live doing anything for just a few more hours. With the Timekeepers hot on their trail, they begin robbing banks to redistribute time to those in need, sort of a Robin Hood of the time clock.

Eventually we know that a final confrontation will result as Raymond diligently pursues the couple as does the local hood Will confronted at the start of the film. With plenty of high speed chases and some face to face confrontation, the film features plenty of action for fans without a ton of story to get in the way. Sure the story is there but as the film heads to its end it becomes smaller and smaller.

The time is money wordplay works well throughout the film and the story does have enough meat on it to be interesting. As always it does ring a little hypocritical for high paid movie stars to be in a movie that's presents an allegory about how wealthy people should share the wealth with everyone instead of taking it all for themselves, especially when ticket prices for a movie run an average of $9.

Timberlake shows that he can act better than many would expect. Too many write him off as little more than a singer but he's turning into one of the few all round entertainers show business has to offer. Seyfried looks gorgeous as always and does a great job when it comes to action as well. Murphy demonstrates that he's not a one note actor, offering a performance of a cop on a mission quite well.

On the whole the movie is pure fluff entertainment posing as a message movie. The entertainment offered is substantial but the message is lost and would seem better suited for a Michael Moore movie where he sits in his mansion complaining about how the little people are being ripped off.

4421423,3,B004LWZW7E,"In Time is a science fiction thriller about a future world where scientists have managed to turn off the aging gene making everyone unaging, to avoid massive over population a system is put into place where everyone is born with a timer on their right arm, once a person turn 25 years old they stop aging and the timer start counting down one year, one the timer runs out the person dies. Now in this world time is currency, the lower class is working to earn another day of life, everything is paid for with hours and minutes, and then you have a rich upper class who live in luxury and literary have all the time in the world making them immortal. The main character is a poor man named Will Salas who after a chance encounter with a suicidal but rich man end up with over 100 years of life and a knowledge of how corrupt the whole system realty is. Will off course soon meet a beautiful woman, the rich man's daughter Sylvia who share his idea on the unfairness of the system. The rest of the movie is part a modern time Robin Hood story and part social commentary about social inequality.

In Time have a great concept. In many ways the story is very similar to the Jack Vance novel To Live Forever, the idea of s dystopian future where people's lives are used as currency is interesting and draw you into the story. I love the way time is transferred between people as they only need to touch one another's arms, this create a distance between people as everyone is always afraid of having their time stolen. I also like the world building, how we get a good look at what life must be like in this society, Science Fiction is all about asking what if, what if this technology where part of human society, how would it change us? In time both asks that question and then explores it well. The time as currency aspect is well developed and presented in a credible and detailed way.

One problem with the movie however is that the world of In Time looks exactly like ours, I mean this film is set a couple of hundred years into the future. Now I do not expect them to have flying cars and robots, but you would suspect technology had developed some at least. Now I get it, the people in a position to develop new technologies are immortal so it would probably be some slowdown as no one would be in a hurry to get something done, but there have to have been some changes in 200+ years, even fashion is mostly the same. This was something which made it hard for me to suspend disbelief that this future would where exactly like our own except for people not aging and buying and selling time to live. Another thing I found unrealistic was the time zones, basically you have several cities with roadblocks between them to keep the rich and the poor separated, the problem is that there is 12 or so timezones and each zone seam to be the size of a city or so, ok but where is the rest of America, not to mention the rest of the world? Do they use the same system? Do they age, have they stopped aging and just let people live forever if they want? Do they use another system? None of this is even addressed in the movie. The would of In Time is completely limited to the 12 or so time zones and outside of that everything is a complete blank, something which is a little hard to buy.

The acting in In Time is passable, you will find nothing fantastic here, the emotional scenes can seam a bit lacking which make it hard to care about the character, but for the action segment the actors get the job done. The music in this movie works to set the mood for the scenes it is in but it is forgettable. The camera work is quite ok. The characters in this movie is rather good, yes they are stereotypes, but they are well crafted versions of the stereotypes they are based on.

I enjoyed In Time, it was an entertaining movie. At times the phasing is terrible and the movie feel a bit cluttered, it sort of make the story needlessly complicated which just leaves the movie feel rushed, but all in all this is a good movie. Now In Time will never be a cult classic, but if you like science fiction, and especially dystopian future stories then this flick might be worth checking out.

Then ...The main character meets a rich girl and kidnaps her..there is not even a close bond between the two of them or any romance to speak of...they just keep obtaining bits of time and keep on ticking..Very few movies have heart and substance these days..one watches the movie, then has no desire to watch it again..and if went to Cinema to see it...leaves the theater feeling sort of cheated at having to spend 10 dollars on it....which is outrageous to begin with and they do not even make kids..babies keep quiet like they did when i was a kid...",1331510400,4,1270,4.574561403508772

The pacing is off, the editing choppy, and the actors seem somewhat lost. Also, during the ""arm-wrestling"" scene with the gangster near the end, Niccol commits the deadlist screenwriting sin: the deus ex machina (hint: it's the hidden gun). And although this has an interesting premise, there's a huge plot hole: if the ""rich"" (signified by their decades and centuries of time) move so slowly and have no worries, why do they all look like supermodels? I would imagine they would all look like the humans in ""Wall-E.""

4421445,3,B004LWZW7E,"In Time presents an abnormal futuristic society where time is the newest currency of choice.  Enter Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake), destined to live a life of little means, meaning he lives to gain more time, working, day in and day out, to prolong his own life and that of his mother, Rachel, played by Olivia Wilde.  If you're wondering about Olivia Wilde playing his mother, let me break things down for you.  Everyone physically stops aging at 25.  They have been genetically engineered not only to stop aging at 25 but also have an internal clock (okay, well, it's not so internal, because the countdown is visible on everyone's arm) that is counting down until the moment they die (and when they do die, it looks like they have some kind of massive heart attack, so maybe it's actually some internal bomb that destroys the heart, which, hey, since we don't get any explanations, could actually be mechanical).  In this way, it is possible for people to live hundreds of years, thus looking 25 but actually being around 38 and so on.  The catch is that they have to keep earning time by working (and lose it when making purchases, like buying food or wanting to take a bus).  When a person's clock reaches zero, they die.  The poor struggle for more time (little side conversations are dropped here and there about needing to hurry), while the rich are born and destined to live a long, long time.

Everything changes the day Will encounters a rich and reckless Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who flashes his many years in one of the poorest sections of town, an act which incites trouble (keep a lookout for some futuristic gangsters, led by Fortis, played by Alex Pettyfer, and one of his cronies who dresses ridiculously - that hat annoyed me to death - he's supposed to look tough?) and sets this tale in motion.  Will saves his life, Henry reveals that he has lived a very long time and is ready for it all to end (he also drops some information that shocks Will but which isn't all that shocking to the viewer), and by morning, Henry is gone, and Will has more years than he has ever dreamed of earning.  Shortly after, a tragedy happens and Will is determined to get revenge.

While I think this movie is interesting, you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy it.  You're told that people stop aging at 25 due to genetic engineering, and then their countdown begins (which makes it possible to live forever if characters play their cards right)...but this isn't delved into too deeply.  The subject of health problems is never brought up, so I only assume that this is such an advanced society that even cancer has been eradicated (as no one in the movie is sick; also, no one is overweight, so I guess they've taken care of obesity as well).  Along with this, the entire subject of the genetic engineering that has led to this current state of affairs is mentioned the one time and never talked about again.  Characters also exchange time (which confused the heck out of me when the film began).  They hold onto each other or use a little metal device and can take and give time (again, this is never explained and the viewer is left to speculate how this is possible).  In Time doesn't explain things.  It doesn't explain what happened to illnesses, how aging was stopped, how this genetic engineering thing works (or even how it was accomplished), how people can physically exchange time in order to gain more or give their own freely, and even how time can be used as a currency.  I think these oversights (but hey, they might have just messed the movie up even more if they had been included, maybe leading to more confusion), along with bad casting (which is covered next), are the things which ruin this movie.

I know Justin Timberlake mainly as a singer, and, while, I'm not against singers turned actors, I wasn't overly moved by his performance or even attached to his character.  I don't think he did an awful job, but it wasn't anything noteworthy, either.  On a similar note, Amanda Seyfried as the spoiled Sylvia Weis (who becomes the Bonnie to Will's Clyde) manages to make herself useful only by standing around, her eyes looking gigantic and catlike, her wig very fake, and her actions very robotic; oh, and let's not forget how smart it is to wear a pair of high heels (because being stylish when you're being naughty is oh, so intelligent; and you definitely won't have to run when being on the country's most wanted list - *please note the heavy sarcasm).  On the one hand, I find the concept of time as currency intriguing, but the movie drags on and on, the acting isn't the best (though Olivia Wilde and Cillian Murphy stand out), the amount of unanswered questions I had about this society grew and grew as the movie progressed, and there was a certain inconsistancy to some of the characters.

Tragedy takes place, Will crosses the border separating the rich from the poor, and his sadness over his loss seems to vanish (barring instances where he's moodily staring off into space, all the while - of course - being watched by Sylvia and her massive eyes).  I was enjoying the movie before he went into the richer portion of town.  Once he went there, it was apparent that this movie was going to shirk the loss this character had undergone, and throw a lot out all for the sake of a romance with no spark (and a heroine whose sudden change in opinions felt rushed and out of character).  The first scenes between Will and Sylvia were annoying and didn't go with what had already taken place in the film.

Later, Will and Sylvia take action and start behaving like a futuristic Robin Hood/Maid Marian pairing, stealing from the poor to give to the rich.  I thought this was a little interesting, but it wasn't enough.  Cillian Murphy's character had so much potential, not only in the development in his character but because he can actually act.  Unfortunately, I think what happens with this character was too predictable.  It was the easy way to end things, and it was also a cop-out.

On a more positive note, I liked the futuristic police cars, the concept of the movie was interesting (though the message behind things was overly stressed), and I enjoyed certain scenes.  I've considered whether I think this is worth a 2.5 (not possible on Amazon) or 3 star rating, and I'm going to have to go with a 3-star rating.  I liked some things about the movie.  It's very different and quite interesting, but the acting doesn't hold up (and I honestly think the inclusion of Sylvia's character is one of the downfalls of the film), there are numerous plot holes and unanswered questions, and it's more of a sit-back-don't-think-and-just-enjoy type flick.  Don't expect too much from this.

Overall: This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone.  I think the cons largely outweigh the pros in this case, but I sort of enjoyed watching it (sort of).  This wasn't a film I hated, and I didn't love it either.",1330905600,4,6954,4.625711960943857

4421507,2,B004LWZW7E,"The concept behind this film is a fascinating one, but sadly, the film disappoints.

Gaping plot holes make this movie hard to take seriously. The passage of time is utterly unrealistic, with characters repeatedly running distances of several hundred yards in mere seconds. A nearly two-hour sprint is not enough to cause one of the characters to break a sweat.

Poor dialogue causes frequent chuckling throughout serious scenes. As an example, in one scene, after a few minutes of running together, one character stops, says ""follow me to the other,"" then resumes running.

The acting is not strong, but it isn't laughable. Quite frankly, I expected worse out of Justin Timberlake, but he held up okay in this role. (Don't expect Oscars in the near future, however.)

The movie's redeeming points are its concept and how it encourages the viewer to consider how they would choose to behave with only a day to live. Overall, however, I had a hard time justifying even the dollar or two I spent to rent this one.",1330905600,,1011,4.826589595375722
4421508,2,B004LWZW7E,"I, like most had seen the trailer for this in theaters and put this on my ""must see"" list!  I did not make it to see this in the theaters and I am kind of glad that I did not.

This film had a good concept which of course is based on current events like the 1% vs. the 99% - the very greedy haves vs. the have-nots/can't let them get!  This film is clearly and overt political film which should have been more covert in order to truly get it's point across.  This film touches on the mega rich vs. the poor and how the mega rich not only keep the poor down and away from them, but they also make sure that they can never achieve anything in life - unless allowed by the mega rich!  It is art imitating life - albeit financed by the 1%!
The idea of the film is that time is used as currency to determine how long you are to live.  The more that you make, the longer you live.  The more you make, the more things that you can do.  Of course in real life, the more that you make the more that you can do and the longer you CAN live due to better health care and other factors.  There is no paper money or anything called money it is just time that you deal with.  Of course the mega rich horde all of the time for themselves and they could care less who has any.

The film takes place in a place called Dayton - although we can clearly see the Los Angeles skyline in the background!  That is the ghetto, and there is the wealthy suburb of ""New Greenwich"" which I assume is supposed to be a place like Greenwich, CT where the mega rich live and they do what they can to keep ""others"" out of the town and they know instantly if you do not `belong' there!

The scope of the film was large, but the execution was small.  I do not know if this is due to the budget, the producer's vision of the limited L.A. scenery, but the film does not LOOK good!  It takes place 150 years from now, but it looks like it takes place 50 years ago!  150 years from now and they ride in cars from the 80's, 60's and 70's?  I guess that is a part of the budget.  I also hate it when films that take place in the future always have the same look with the long coat cops and plain vehicles.

I know that parts of this future are based on what many say people are planning which includes biochips (available), population reduction (so that the rich will have less challengers), economic collapse (to make people rebel so that they can be killed), increasing the cost of living while keeping pay the same and a police state!  I hope those are not the plans because that would be a foolish thing to do for the US.  This film touches on it but the setting, look and ""futuristic"" design do not translate well in 2011/2012 given that things look a lot better now.  They should have spent more or chosen a different city to film in and it should have been done iRobot style.

The BD picture quality is of course A1 since this is a new release and they are not really going to look bad most times.  This is something to see, but not anything to buy.  Timberlake's acting is not too bad if you keep in mind that he was a signer first.

Being only 28 years old I couldn't imagine living in a world like that; although somewhat similar to this world, you don't die here if you run out of money.

Heres the interesting part about this movie, the focus is the fact that time=money and there will never be enough. The not so interesting? well the entire human race decided to give up the concept of money in exchange for a genetic clock on everyones arm that is some how updated by either magic hard drive or shaking hands really hard. Why is EVERYONE's clock green? People are still vain, even in the future, surley if they can master clockinyourarm technology they can change the hue of the numbers.

The movie has some sex, some running around and shooting, and some kind of heartful lines about how screwed everyone is because the system is a lie. And this is the part where this movie is ruined for me and if you still plan on watching this then don't read this.

First off, why are the police so lack luster? If this is such a facist state in which you have to pay ""time"" in order to essentially do ANYTHING except take a piss then where are all the cops which really impressive crowd control gear. They probably spent most of the money on timberlake and trying to ""future"" out the cars which was a complete waste of money because there is such a difference in quality of cars. In one scene theres the brand new dodge challenger parked next to what is that a bronco II??? Anyways, the biggest problem besides the fact that timberlake and thatotherchick manage to somehow rob a bank and its headquarters completley unscathed, is the lack of any real character. Everyone introduced is sort of thrown away in a couple of minutes and most of the actors don't really seem to care because it's not really believable. Not the concept of the movie, but it's enviroment. Everything looks pretty normal still, and no one's really that bothered. What I mean by that is, if you lived in a world where people were dying all around you every second LITERALLY constantly dropping dead in the streets because they were essentially poor then you don't think there would be constant screaming and crying somewhere in the backround? There's no tension in this movie despite the obvious plot thickeners. It's pretty much timberlake just running around doing action stuff and expressing his good guy apathy.

 Cillian Murphy also plays a character in this movie which is actually the reason why I rented it. Unfortunatley this movie just denies him of any kind of cool scene in anyway shape or form even tho he drives the most exspensive murder mobile in the whole movie(the challenger) but really doesn't even do anything cool with it either so it's actually a complete waste of money (give us scary cops with cool riot gear instead). He wears a trench coat, which automatically makes him the boss, but dies the lamest death I think I've ever seen in a movie. Seriously he just drops dead because he runs out of time, what???? He's called a -> TIMEKEEPER <- You're telling me that this guy who is essentially capable of taking your life via handjob without any sort of probable cause or real reason doesnt constantly carry one of those magic hard drives just in case I dunno, uh, that?

It reminds me, and I think intended to remind us, of today's America made a bit worse, as time to live replaces money. One per cent or so have most of the time, much more than they need or many of them even want. Quite a few are in the middle. Many, and a growing number, struggle to get time to live just another day, or often even a few minutes so they can then earn or steal enough time to try to live another day, week or month. Worst of all, the scarcity of time for the majority is an artificial creation, as is IMO the current austerity.

 Time is money.  A poor man (Timberlake) finds a way out of the ghetto, thus encountering all the systemic opposition that this discovery is sure to generate.  Nothing unbelievable about that.  The director (who also did Gattaca) provides us with a number of the adages and questions that apply to our own system, such as,  ""Is it theft to steal what is already stolen?"" and  ""Not everyone can be immortal (rich)."" This latter statement is shot down early in the movie when a disillusioned character exposes the ""truth,"" saying, ""there is enough for everyone.""  In our current era of technology, in which wealth and poverty is not a problem of scarcity, but distribution, I found this willingness to examine the issue in this way to be refreshing.
 Perhaps most believable of all was the way that society had accommodated this impossible culture.  (I suspect that in a few hundred years historians will say the same thing about the excesses of Western society.)  The rich, ""don't look. (at death and suffering)  You close your eyes.""  And the poor largely accept their lot.
 The near impossibility of changing the system is emphasized, which I found pessimistically accurate.  Still, I would have hoped for a more political or revolutionary solution than the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" style ending it leaves us with.",1330214400,,1583,4.894736842105263

4421681,4,B004LWZW7E,"I'm surprised at the severely negative reviews on this film since it's significantly more watchable than I expected from reading them. Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) gives us another ingenious concept - lifetime traded as currency - and then builds an average script around it. It gets into the areas of redestribution of wealth (time) and alludes to evil corporations and billionaires (immortals) but gives us a pretty tame bad guy even by real life standards.

Generally the casting is quite solid though somehow I don't put Seyfried and Timberlake together - I wondered if Cillian Murphy might have been better in the lead. The plot raises enough interesting questions between the action set pieces to keep you thinking, though with such a strong concept it could have been a Blade Runner-quality film with a total script revamp. Instead, I found myself reminded of pieces of other films like Bonnie and Clyde and Gattaca.

Still, In Time is better than many films I've seen recently. If you like thought-provoking concepts, you might just forgive the fact it doesn't live up to the promise but does at least deliver an enjoyable ride.",1329609600,2,1131,4.978835978835979

4421737,2,B004LWZW7E,"What if time is really money? ""The Truman Show"" screenwriter Andrew Niccol's latest film takes the idea of ""time as currency"" seriously. Set in an unspecified future world, a sci-fi thriller ""In Time"" gives another meaning to a frequently used phrase ""wasting one's time."" Here the class structures of the haves and the have-nots are determined by the time left to live, shown by the internal ""body clock"" on the wrist.

Many people say the idea is interesting. Maybe. But no matter how good the ideas may be, they need to be developed to be turned into a drama with a story. Andrew Niccol, the director of brilliant ""Gattaca,"" seems to have forgotten that. The rest of ""In Time"" is a tepid action flick that does not what it wants to do, that is made up of bits and pieces borrowed from other action movies.

All characters are stock types. Justin Timberlake is one of the ""have-nots,"" hard-working Will Salas. Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, a daughter of a rich family. Cillian Murphy is Raymond Leon, a veteran ""timekeeper."" Throughout the film, what they really want to do is never fully explained. (What does Murphy's ""timekeeper"" have to keep anyway?) The subplot about Johnny Galecki's character, friend of Timberlake's hero, is terribly bland.

There are so many holes in the plot, but the biggest problem of the film is its inept storytelling and lack of characters we can identify with. We don't need car chases. We don't need guns. We need someone like Truman Burbank whom we really cared about. Sadly ""In Time"" doesn't have one.",1329436800,3,1541,4.785714285714286

I've mentioned this to a few friends who seem unable to reconcile my comparisons between the two projects with their own takes on In Time, but to me there is a slight similarity. Anyway, I was unexpectedly impressed with this 2011 feature and its strong acting all across the board and its central plot about human beings with expiration dates dwelling in an unequal society wherein time literally is money.

The entire ""high concept"" part of the movie is quite impressive and very elegantly crafted.  The method of intra-personal time transfers is inspired.  However, and I'm not sure if it's a stylistic decision to go with the concept, but certain endings, including the movie itself, are quite abrupt.  There is a shadow of a climactic ending, but instead it's left so limply open ended and non-confrontational it becomes anti-climactic as everyone shys away from the protagonist as he deux-ex-es his way through the powers that be.  Cillian Murphy did the best he could, but the none-too-subtle shift of the antagonist from Weis to Leon in the death-sprialing denouement left him the target of the writer's desperate resolution instead of the recipient of a beautiful Inspector Javert-style redemption.  It's like Kartheiser stopped showing up to work in light of all the talent around him, and Murphy was written back into the story to pick up the slack.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Mankind has been genetically altered.  At the age of 25 they stop aging but a timing system only gives them 1 more year to live.  To get more time they have to work hard and they get compensated with time as currency. Everyone looks 25 but in reality they can be well over 100 years old with thousands of years more time on their biological clocks.

Everything you want is paid with minutes, hours, days or years of lifespan.  Unfortunately the same establishment that gives you time payment for your work also keeps raising the cost of living (cost of living has a new meaning now doesn't it).  Prices seem to go up every day.  It is a method of population control.

Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and his mom live day to day just barely having enough time left to survive each day.  A stranger who Will saves gives Will over 100 years of time leaving only 5 minutes to himself because he wants to die.  When Will realizes what has happened he plans to meet his mom to share the time and rejoice.

The story leads to Will seeking vengeance for such a ruthless system when he realizes that the rich can be immortal while the poor live day to day in fear.  He meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) whose father is a timer broker and together they figure out how to get justice and share the life time currency with those who really need it.

This movie has a great premise and has several analogies with the rich and poor in the world today.  Can you imagine knowing the time of your death and being helpless to prevent it?  Unfortunately the movie that could have been great falls short on several issues.  Two people with no criminal history are making daring robberies and stealing the most precious commodity in the world while millions just passively face death every day.

With a better script and perhaps an underground movement to support them, this movie could have been a lot better.  Expecting two people to save millions is a little over the top.

Acting was passable OK with Timberlake a touch better. What was missing to me was greater depth-of-character and in particular the back story of how the whole time transfer and it's consequences was achieved.

Of course the richer you are, the more time you have.  In this world, everyone looks 25 no matter how old you really are, so don't look for any cameos from Harrison or Clint.
My main problem with IN TIME is the miscasting of Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.  While Justin is to be commended for his acting diversity e.g. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, BAD TEACHER etc., I found it hard to accept him as an action hero.  Seyfried has a commanding screen presence more effective in lighter fare e.g. MAMMA MIA, LETTERS FROM JULIET, etc.  She looks great with the 80s brunette pageboy but comes off a little vapid.  The supporting cast fares much better.  Cillian Murphy brings a strong dedication to his role as the Timekeeper.  Vincent Kartheiser is appropriately cold and prudish as millionaire father of Seyfried.  WHITE COLLAR's Matt Bomer evinces pathos as Justin's generous but doomed donator.  HOUSE's beautiful Olivia Wilde in a brief role as Justin's mother (?) is effective.  Alex Pettyfrew as the smarmy time-thug and Johnny Galecki as the loyal friend round out the cast.

Unfortunately this movie - instead of playing with this very unique concept - quickly dissolves into some silly critique of capitalism with the message being that it's OK to steal from the rich 'because they stole it first' which seems to become the prevailing attitude in our society. The rich and successful are evil...

In the third act the two protagonists simply resort to stealing time and distributing it trying to bring the system down, ignoring their previous correct epiphany that whatever time they steal and donate the establishment simply will raise prices to restore equilibrium.

I'll set aside the obvious flaws about how easy it is to transfer time from one individual to another w/o any safeguards imagine debit cards w/o pin codes for one account that holds all your money w/o any withdrawal limits and no traceability of who took your money BUT wouldn't it have been way more interesting a premise to work on a solution to disable the clock to bring the system down, or manipulate he clock to give everybody unlimited time? Instead our two protagonist just head over to the next bank to steal more time, which will ultimately lead to their certain demise.

In the future, we can genetically engineer you to age only 25 years yet we seem to throw even the minimal security of a PIN number to protect our assets out the window.  Apparently the best security available in the future is archaic bank vaults.  Movies like this turn people off to sci-fi when actually, sci-fi can be one of the most philosophical and thought-provoking genres to watch.

And I find it really ironic when Hollywood tries to make a movie about the oppressed, low-wage earning masses.  If this movie is supposed to increase our awareness of the imbalance of wealth in today's society, don't do it with actors who are worth millions.

4421836,2,B004LWZW7E,"I'm a sucker for a good sci- fi / action movie. I'm rather forgiving in just how much I will overlook in the name of quality entertainment.

First, the Good: Some of the acting (Cillian Murphy, Justin Timberlake and a few others) are respectably solid. Also, the overall concept is very intriguing... the world currency is time, and when a person turns 25 their ""life clock"" actually begins. From the time you are 25, life's objective is to keep your life clock from expiring. If it expires, you die. Not a problem for the rich, who have more time than they know what to do with: a ""wealthy"" person may have centuries to live, while the ""poor"" continuously struggle for more time. It's a very interesting premise that becomes more interesting when a poor worker (Justin Timberlake) saves a ""wealthy"" man from a time stealing mob boss while flaunting his wealth in the ghetto. in return, he gives Justine Timberlake all of his time (over 100 years). In a short but very philosophical discussion the wealthy man, who has mentally lived too long, says ""We are meant to die.""

So begins a science fiction tale that promises to serve up plenty of symbolism, philosophical overtones about economy and the meaning of existence. Could it possibly be the rare sci fi / action film panned by critics but destined to become a cult classic somewhere down the road?

Hell no.

Unfortunately, that's about as good as the film gets.

Actually, the movie starts to go down hill and remains spiraling out of control with the entrance of Amanda Seyfried. Sadly, the story abandons all of its earlier adult-oriented promise to become a vapid ""love story"" seemingly aimed at a much younger audience. I was not impressed with Seyfried in ""Red Riding Hood"" and even less impressed with her here. This suprises me, because normally I think she's a good actress. In this movie, she serves well as eye candy, but her acting in this movie was cardboard flat awful. However, in her defense, the characters aren't scripted very well and she really wasn't given much to work with.

For example: she plays a wealthy girl who is kidnapped by Justin Timberlake and taken to the ghetto. They are both rendered unconscious and robbed of nearly all their time. Now they have to stay on the move and struggle to stay alive without running out of time. Excellent premise! However, never once does she seem very concerned that she is mere minutes from certain death. She acts incredibly hum-drum for a rich girl who always had an over-abundance of time and now, for the first time in her life (presumably) literally has almost none. The sense of non-urgency really detracted from what could have - and SHOULD have been an incredibly suspenseful segment of the film. Just another example of weak script, weak acting and weak directing all coming together.

The third act gets even worse when the two lovers turn into Robin Hood-esque characters, stealing from the wealthy and giving to the poor. The movie becomes so trite that anything once redeeming is no longer a part of the equation. Not that I have a problem with the class warfare message behind the film: I agree with a lot of it. I just felt the execution of that message fell flat.

Also, the 'ghetto' was way too tame: in a world where time can be exchanged simply by grabbing someones arm, think how chaotic, dismal and brutal the ghetto would really be with people killing eachother just to survive a few more minutes. The movie becomes its own worst enemy by completely santizing what it's attempting to condemn in the first place. I understand they didn't want to cross over into R- rated territory, but the ghetto should have been much more chaotic and gritty- even at PG-13.

All in all, this movie is so incredibly disappointing because it started with so much promise and then took all that promise and wasted it. Some the actors were solid- I've always been impressed with Cillian Murphy and I must admit that Timberlake easily holds his own as well (except for the god-awful scene when his ""mother"" is killed, which was cringe-worthy bad).

With a tighter script and direction, more concentration on story and suspense as opposed to a vapid love story between the stereotypically over-indulged rich girl and the poor boy from the opposite side of the tracks- this could have been so much better than it actually was.",1328486400,165,4348,4.731836195508587

4421868,1,B004LWZW7E,"First off, be clear that this film unashamedly states that its time economy system is actually ""Darwinist Capitalism"", quoted from Weis; the million year man, although there is nothing free-market or capitalist about it as in the film they can apparently just raise prices and no other business/person steps in to compete by selling the same goods for less, pushing back down prices. No, this film with all it's ridiculously preachy anti-capitalism and cliched lines is really about the danger of a big government who has the power to control markets, business and people be it big socialist/open society or fascist (tho I'm sure the maker of this film would vehemently disagree). Other times this film is simply ridiculous with its glaring plot holes and unbelievable moments. Examples include: 1. They meet a roadblock of at least 12 armed men with automatic weapons and drive pass and through all of them unscathed 2. Apparently while noone ever ages due to genetic engineering, everyone dies of what looks like heart failure when the clock on their arm runs out, but the film never goes into any real depth explaining why and since it's stopped when they transfer this ""time"" why doesn't anyone go create more of the stuff that's stopping death and solve the problem or if it's a programmed death (as one can infer), why don't the protagonists/others go get the death gene removed/fixed? But no that would apparently ruin the painfully flawed premise and strongly anti-capitalist tone and metaphors if one introduces logic and the fact that in a capitalist/free market system some entrepreneur would invest to start a business to find, create and sell a cure and customers would buy the cheapest, most effective cure offered. The constant preachiness throughout the film is grating but don't just take my word or interpretation, read some of the quotes as they are: ""This is merely survival of the fittest - Darwinist Capitalism. Natural Selection"" by Weis, ""I worked out how to escape"" Leon ""and now you want to make sure no one else does"" Salas, ""All they have to do is keep raising the cost of living"" Salas (you know government printing money, raising taxes and burdensome regulations might have alot more to do with this than ""evil"" businesses), ""Does everyone from the ghetto steal?"" Sylvia ""Oh that's rich coming from you! Let me guess, now you like the idea of sharing?"" Salas (the rich got so by offering goods/services of value that people decided to buy, when did that become stealing? - only if capitalism ceases and government forces people to buy a product or service / prevents other companies from competing), ""He was killed for giving away what he won... for giving them hope"" Salas, ""Taxes and prices go up so people keep dying. How else could there be men with a million years when most live day to day?"" Hamilton, ""If you guys are looking for stolen time you should arrest everyone here!"" Salas (at fancy party), ""For a few to be immortal, many must die"" Weis (the rich generally do not become rich by stealing from or killing their customers, but creating something that will improve people's lives / people want). And sick justifications for robbing people and banks to give to some other person like ""Is it stealing if its already stolen?"" and ""Don't think of it as stealing, think of it as repossession"" Salas. Terrible, the pretty faces and tense running to save mother/love interest scenes are the only things that gave enough entertainment to bear it.

The concept itself was top notch, and although I found the film to have a lull to it during certain fight or flee scenes, it still held my attention.  There isn't necessarily a lot of twists, but that is not what a movie like this is about.  It's about the futuristic society, it's landscape and characters and their struggles.  The Sociological implications were well implemented throughout the film, and Timberlake proved again that he is becoming an actor who can play any role with conviction.

4421918,2,B004LWZW7E,"The premise of In time seemed interesting. you have a clock on your wrist that starts when you are 25 years old. Get more time and stay alive. If not, you get the idea.commerce is measured in time now, too, and life can truly become limitless. Enter the Ghetto and a dream that lives with his mother, living from minute to minute, in debt, wanting to go into another time zone and move up. Everything seems the same until he meets a man in a bar with over a century to burn.

Maybe I expected something different, or maybe it was the way the movie played out. i'm not really sure. what I do know is that it was hard to get into this movie, and much of it was because the plot bounced around too much. One moment we are looking at a hero flick, then a moving-on-up flick, then a love flick, then some action in a round-about way. It kept pinballing and that got annoying, only coming together for the benefit of being over. When our main event happened, I thought it was about changing the world. This was reinforced by the thing with the bus (trying to be vague because of spoilers), but then it slowed to a crawl when Justin arrived at his lovely gambling destination. Romance washed away all the years of love and loyalty, and the ocean scene and the timekeeper business just made it more taxing.

The acting was off in this film, too, with a lot of the lines and the actions coming off stiff. I have seen all the main actors before and know it could have been better, so that was disappointing. It was almost like they were doing it on purpose, like giving their lines with no ""boom"" was the director's idea. Equally bothersome was the way the people dressed, like a GQ spread and not living, and the way they carried themselves. I knew who a lot of the main characters were because of the actors playing them, but the lower tier characters were a bit confusing because of the age thing and the fact that no time was added ot making them distinct. In a movie when minutes are a premium, a lot of time was spent with scattered ideas like the father, the reoccurring baddies, and so on. When you combine this with a plot that is waning and a movie that becomes rather preachy in its society lesson 101 kinda way, it gets old.

i'm not too terrible picky when it comes to my films, but this didn't make me happy. i had expectations but I don't think they were too high above the rim, and this went below. Skip it and watch something else - you'll be happier for it.",1328054400,9,2465,4.274089935760172

The story takes place in the distant future when adults stop aging at 25 but instead accrue time as currency. When factory worker Will Salas ends up with 116 years of time belonging to a dead man, he's accused of murder, and with a businessman's daughter in tow, he sets out to confront the system. Despite an intriguing premise and capable people both in front of and behind the camera, In Time suffers from all too blunt and heavy-handed storytelling.

Partly my problem on how to describe main male character is that the ""villians"" are not very strong characters.

4421921,4,B004LWZW7E,"Not bad at all.

Have to admit at having deep reservations regarding Timberlake. His previous films were middling to barrel bottom. Few performers can transition readily between completely different mediums. Rarely will you see a writer make a great painter; a wrestler make a great singer. And based on what I heard from other scifi film fans when this first went into production, and my own experience, misgivings were not completely unfounded.

So I admit at being happily surprised. He wasn't bad. In fact, I'd rate the film pretty good and his execution solid. Not that he's going to be queuing up to the award shows, but decent enough where I didn't cringe.

It's a solid blend of several well-worn themes, drawing most notably from '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonnie-and-Clyde/dp/B0010YVCI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonnie and Clyde</a>'. But that's not a knock. Nothing wrong with a reboot, if it's done well - improving and not just rehashing.

And it's clever enough to cover the thin spots, smart enough to push back heavy examination, and primarily - set on a solid action oriented pace so that you don't focus too hard on the loose underpinnings of the plot.

My only serious critique, and I don't mean to take anything away from a very decent performance by the young songster, but I couldn't help but think how much better this could've been with Matt Bomer in the lead role; he played the disillusioned Greenwich swell.

Just saying.

Overall, a very entertaining and interesting film premise. Completely worth the funds and time spent.

Movie Note: This wasn't the first 'Time Equals Life' concept to be produced. For those interested in film history, check out 1987's ""The Price Of Life"", which aired as part of a Showtime scifi anthology series.",1328054400,2,1809,5.213793103448276

However, for those of you trying to decide between blu-ray and the regular DVD, here are a few things that might help:

First off, the Blu-Ray really only has two true extras, ""The Minutes"" and extended/deleted scenes. Overall, the Minutes special was good. It was probably about 15-20 minutes long. (I didn't time it so I'm just guessing by what it felt like.) However, it is NOT a making-of feature like I originally thought.

It's actually a bunch of fake interviews that took place before the movie was made that involve most of the main characters, as well as some new ones, such as one of the original creators of immortality. They were interesting and added extra information to the world, but if you're looking for an actual documentary on the creation of the movie, you'll have to look elsewhere.

As for the deleted/extra scenes, they were hit and miss. Some of the scenes added some very interesting information that I wish they'd kept in the movie while others merely added a line or two to an existing scene and it didn't make any difference at all. Overall, I think there were about ten of them (again, I'm guessing since I didn't count) but the first three or four are the ""added a line or two"" variety and pretty boring.

His personal timer - begun for all on their 25th birthday - displays vividly on his forearm.  In this Brave New World with day-glow countdowns, most people scratch and claw their way through life and work to accumulate more currency in the form of time.  Time pays for everything with an expiration date: eggs, milk, and even life.  So when Will runs into Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a rich man flaunting his time around at a seedy bar in the ghetto, he intervenes to save Hamilton from a murderous Minuteman (i.e. time thief) played excellently by  Alex Pettyfer.  The old man, deciding he has had enough of life, essentially commits suicide by gifting all of his time to Will, creating a situation where Will can simultaneously serve as a Timex Robin Hood, dishing out time to all he deems deserving, and upwardly mobile revenge-seeker.  In this latter role, Will encounters aristocrat Phillipe Weis (Karheiser) and his cute daughter Sylvia (Seyfried).  It's no surprise the opposites of Will and Sylvia connect - he throws caution to the wind while she takes no risks with her eternal lifetime.  Ultimately the age-old battle against ""the man"" ensues, where Cillian Murphy awkwardly chases Will and Sylvia before the combo create communistic chronicity.

What struck me while watching this film is internet joke regarding money, women, and time that holds true for Will's encounters with the fairer sex.

Women require time and money
The old Ben Franklin saying, ""Time is money.""
A little math gives us: Women = (Money) * 2
The mistransliteration of the Old Testament tells us ""Money is the root of all problems.""
Therefore, Women=Problems.

Overall the film is well executed, but a little underwhelming.

  Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.

  ""Time is money"" was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to ""money is time"" is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.",1326499200,2,1987,4.551820728291316
4421973,1,B004LWZW7E,"This is one boring movie! Every scene is like a WTF scene! It gets old fast! No action, crappy script and it goes nowhere. Every time, you want something to happen and it never does. Terrible terrible movie. Fine actors gone to waste. No emotions, no substance. This whole movie could have been half its length if the scenes didn't drag on. It was very repetitive.",1326412800,7,364,4.53030303030303
4421974,4,B004LWZW7E,"When I put the movie in my husband asked, ""what is this?"" I told him the title but didn't mention Justin Timeberlake. Mostly because I didn't want him to have any opinion before we started. He had no idea who the star was and really enjoyed the movie. At the end he said, ""that was actually really good.""

It is an interesting concept that actually reminded me a little of Logan's Run. I know many won't know what I am talking about after all it was from 1976, but I really love that movie growing up.

In Logan's Run once you reach 30 you die. This is accepted as your fate and everyone goes except for the runners who don't want to die. For In Time, once you reach 25 you stop aging and suddenly get a digital counter on your arm that basically counts down your life in a way to keep the population controlled.

The only people who live long are the rich. Instead of currency you are paid in time and pay out in time. Your counter is replenished with time when you work, or if someone transfers time to you, otherwise it counts down.

Justin as Will receives time (a lot of time) from someone he helps. When he is falsely accused of murder, he must figure out a way to bring down the system where the wealthy live forever and the poor scramble for every moment. Stealing time from those who fall asleep. It's easy, you simply put your counter against theirs and go!

I had high hopes for this movie and I must admit, I LOVED it. It is a great Sci-fi fix. While I think it could have been better and I am not sure that Justin is a great actor. I truly did enjoy it.  Will has time, Will has no time, Will takes time, Will gives time. Sounds boring but honestly it is pretty creative. Different! The only negative thing my husband said was, ""Justin needs to use his big boy voice.""

Personally it was thought provoking. How would you spend your time? How would you live your life if you know exactly how long you had to live it?

4421976,2,B004LWZW7E,"We always hear the phrase that ""time is money"" and this film takes that to its literal conclusion. A great concept... bu the movie failed to deliver. Justin Timberlake, as someone else pointed out, is a ""celebrity"" as opposed to a true actor. He's adequate in supporting roles, but no way was he even close to capable to execute the lead role in this. He didn't portray the emotional range needed, and wasn't believable in the action parts either. To me, this was most apparent in the pivotal scene early on when Salas was gifted with a century of time. The scenes in the warehouse between him and Matt Bomer's Henry Hamilton set the scene for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, the necessary intensity was only there on one side - Bomer's. He made me believe he was a world-weary centenarian. Unfortunately, Timberlake never made me believe in... anything. And to say that there was a lack of chemistry between him and Seyfried would be a huge understatement. If the main roles had been more believable, and well-acted, the plot holes would have been easier to overlook.

There was so much potential in this, but it just didn't work.",1325203200,3,1136,4.68
4422037,3,B004LWZW7E,"The movie seemed like it was rushed to production or had financing issues because it was lacking on so many levels. The premise, while interesting, needed a lot more thought put into it. It's as if the genesis of the movie began with the idea of using time as currency and that meant a quasi futuristic setting and nothing else. I mean, all the basic elements are there, but that's just it, basic.

I've watched enough movies to suspend my disbelief at will and can find enjoyment even amongst the most mediocre and it wasn't the story or the plot or the terrible acting by Justin Timberlake that ruined the movie for me, it was the editing and cinematography. Case in point, the part where Will Salas and his mother were running towards each other, great scene by the way, went horribly wrong at the end. Editor and director of photography botched it. Scene lost the crucial emotional impact it could have delivered and made a worthwhile cause seem fabricated. At the very least, show us Will's agony of losing his mother right in front of him, mere steps away, show us his mother's expression as she fell in the final second. Then there's the swim in the ocean scene, the bank robbing scene, the kiss in back of the car scene, the list goes on. Watch those scenes and tell me if they do not feel flat to you.

It was only after the movie ended and the credits began rolling that I realized it was done by Andrew Niccol, this is the guy responsible for the brilliantly fantastic Gattaca, one of the most underrated, way ahead of its time movie. No wonder it had that similar vibe and look just a little darker and grungier. Anyway, it was quite a departure from that polished gem of a movie to this hurried mess.

I vaguely remember reading somewhere that this idea was once put forward in a short story some time ago--can't remember where or by whom--I may be wrong. But I just love the idea that was developed in this film that time is currency and one pays for everything with time. Another form of capitalism, another form of poverty, another form of wealth, another Robin Hood character and his girl stealing time to give to the poor!! The plot was brilliant. I love good films--but in this, graphics didn't matter nor filming technicalities nor was I looking for brilliant acting--it all seemed okay because what made this a stimulating, excellent film for me was its masterful, creative plot. Imagine breaking into a bank to steal time, or literally, physically robbing people of time! And a timekeeper is truly a timekeeper! Mind-boggling, so very symbolic; man in any world will always be man--rotten to the core, with a few good guys who will always sacrifice themselves for humanity.

4422042,3,B004LWZW7E,"In a near future world where everyone drives a Dodge Challenger or is chauffeured in a Lincoln Town Car or takes the bus, time is money.  Literally, a person's life span is determined by how much wealth he or she accumulates.  I love the premise.  In order to buy groceries, your life span is shortened by minutes.  Pay your rent?  A couple months.  You replenish your wealth/life span by your work or charity.  The good news is that the clock kicks in when you're 25 and that's how you look until your time expires.  In this film, at 25 everyone is gorgeous too.  I guess the gene pool is changed as well.  Justin Timberlake takes on his first lead role as Will Salas, one of the laborer class who lives day to day with his mom played by Olivia Wilde.  When Will helps an ultra wealthy (centuries in the bank) man from a criminal gang, intent on robbing his time (easily done with a cute arm-to-arm transfer process), the man gives Will all his time, essentially committing suicide.  Will is caught on a camera nearby so becomes the prime suspect in what police believe to be murder.

The story gets interesting when Will escapes to the wealthy part of the city.  He meets a different class and falls for the daughter (a dull Amanda Seyfried) of the central banker (creepy Vincent Kartheiser from ""Mad Men"").  While the trip from the ghetto to the wealthy part of the city took a while the first time, the characters continue to move back and forth with unusual speed.  This didn't make much sense.  The filmmakers were obviously implanting a story line of class warfare, and it's laid down with a heavy hand.  The most interesting character in the movie is the cop known as the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy).  His character should have been more fully explored.  This isn't a terrible movie but is a bit of a bore.  In time you will forget ""In Time"".",1324166400,2,1850,4.5120481927710845

4422045,2,B004LWZW7E,"In Time is based on an interesting concept: a dystopic society where everyone is given a preordained life span of 25 years, with the ability to buy, trade, spend, steal, kill, etc., for their allotted time, and then some. Unfortunately, a good concept does not necessarily extend itself to the formation of a well written, finely executed film.

It begins interestingly enough, even allowing one to overlook Justin Timeberlake's one note acting skills, but soon becomes one long car chase/run from the bad guys bore-fest.

Amanda Seyfried, an actor I usually enjoy, is exceptionally blah, as is Cillian Murphy and the forever smarmy Vincent Kartheiser. I blame the lazy, uninspired, script.

There is much to be explored here, in a world where your bank account and lifespan are linked, but the film treads water, and is more concerned with surface than depth.

It isn't even entertaining in a brain candy and popcorn B movie fashion; it's just dull, poorly acted, and boring. Save your time and money, and skip this one.

4422046,4,B004LWZW7E,"Idea is great - people DO NOT value their time. But at the same time, the drama of running out of time is not emphasized. First third or so is nicely done and builds up the whole idea around limited time, later on idea wears off, and then with the introduction of a higher class movie becomes too Robin Hoody and becomes just an action flick. Soundtrack is great, acting is good. Environments and setups are good (some action scenes are done visibly cheaply). It's def worth watching once. Surprisingly movie is not packed with crazy visual effects, maybe that's why the ones that are here are not umm... done very well.
