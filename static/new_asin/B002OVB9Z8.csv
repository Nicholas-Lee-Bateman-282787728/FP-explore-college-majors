3963574,4,B002OVB9Z8,"One is immediately struck by the fact that the recordings were made in the early digital age. My second criticism  refers to the compilation in mixing classics, jazz etc. I felt it could do with better editing of his lectures concentrating on allied subjects e.g.. more of classical composers, more of jazz. and more of reading music scores.etc.
That aside he was most certainly a brilliant teacher and I enjoyed the parts that interested to me.",1374019200,2,445,4.855263157894737

3963579,5,B002OVB9Z8,"Whoever is interested in Leonard Bernstein as music director, or just as human being, will find this DVD set extremely enjoyable.",1296345600,11,129,5.190476190476191
3963580,5,B002OVB9Z8,"Omnibus was a TV series that debuted in 1952, was hosted by Alistair Cooke, and was mostly about the arts. You might see an original play or a dance performance, a discussion of architecture, or some comedy. Conductor Leonard Bernstein appeared many times over the years. This collection features six of his talks about music and a performance of Handel's Messiah.

Bernstein's first appearance on the show was in 1954 with a fascinating half hour on Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In it, Bernstein explores Beethoven's notebooks to discover what changes Beethoven made to his most famous composition before he decided it was ready for prime time. It's really quite interesting to hear an orchestra play what were early drafts of the Fifth.

It's just as interesting to see this young, dark-haired Bernstein, already a star, athletically urging the orchestra on, singing (a good singing voice was one of the few musical gifts the Maestro did not possess), playing the piano and organ, conducting, even sneaking a cigarette now and then. His manner is professorial and enthusiastic, an engaging combination. He seems to genuinely want to share what he loves about music, and although he indulges in a bit of showing off now and then, it never comes off as condescending.

As someone who knows next to nothing about the study of music, I found this set educational, but not always in the way Bernstein intended. I learned a lot from the Beethoven episode, and the shows about Bach and jazz. Sometimes we end up learning more about Bernstein's preferences than anything else. In the show about opera, he contrasts operatic scenes from La Boheme with the same scenes, but done as theater, without music. The intent is clearly to show how much more drama can be wrung out of a scene if everyone is singing, but I found the acted scenes to be quite dramatic and less overwrought.

I was afraid the set would be hard to watch since it's from the early days of TV, but the picture is clear enough and the sound is good enough, not great, but not distractingly bad.

Fun surprises are seeing an as yet unknown Carol Burnett, aged about 22, belting out a song called ""Ooh La La"" in a powdered Marie Antoinette wig, and Jean Marsh, later to become famous in Upstairs, Downstairs, as Mimi in the non-musical scenes from La Boheme.",1276646400,57,2315,4.791979949874687
3963581,5,B002OVB9Z8,"How lucky we are to have this remarkable genius to help us understand music better...Bernstein is a gifted musician and teacher who brings us information and pleasure at the same time.  What a heritage for us, our children and grandchildren!",1270425600,6,241,5.025
3963582,5,B002OVB9Z8,"""Omnibus"" ran on ABC, CBS, and NBC at various times from 1952 to 1961.  The program showcased both established stars and rising talent from the worlds of music, dance, theater, and opera.  Long a staple of Sunday afternoon programming, ""Omnibus"" eventually moved to other time slots and networks when the value of Sunday real estate rose with the broadcasting of professional football.
 ""Omnibus: Leonard Bernstein"" is a four-disc set containing seven shows aired between 1954 and 1958 that feature Mr. Bernstein's enthusiastic lecture/performances about classical and other forms of music.  Bernstein was equally at home with classical music and musical theater.  He wrote the scores for ""West Side Story"" and ""On the Town"" and was the longtime conductor of the New York Philharmonic.
 His ""Omnibus"" debut was ""Beethoven's Fifth Symphony"" (broadcast live on CBS, November 14, 1954).  Other shows include ""The World of Jazz,"" ""American Musical Comedy,"" ""Introduction to Modern Music,"" ""The Music of J.S. Bach,"" ""The Art of Conducting,""  and ""What Makes Opera Grand?""  The shows are the kind of fare that today can only be seen on PBS.  The TV audience of millions were both entertained and educated by Bernstein's spirited programs.  Clearly, he loved his subjects and his energy and passion come through, even in black and white on the small screen.  Extras include a bonus performance of Handel's ""Messiah"" and a 24-page booklet with contributions written by music critic John Rockwell.",1264636800,86,1488,5.285106382978723
3963583,4,B002OVB9Z8,"The prseentation OF THE ORIGINAL SHOWS is excellent, and the young Bernstein is at his best, but caveat emptor. The copy I just received leaves you no way to remove the captions, although the menu on each CD says you can do so. Is anyone else having this problem? I'm going to exchange mine for that reason.",1264550400,14,307,4.4035087719298245

3963589,5,B002OVB9Z8,"Look, I think I've already died and gone to Heaven with Lenny, watching these dvds.  The Maestro's analysis of The St Matthew Passion bought me to tears. I can't wait for the concert DVD of Candide, and so thankful that we had this brilliant man on this earth, to present the Joy of Music in all it's forms to the world.

I would also like to highly recommend  the DVD ""Bernstein conducts Bernstein"", which includes a fabulous documentary,  ""Teachers and Teaching"" featuring the Maestro reminiscing, instructing, playing(so joyously the Ravel piano concerto), as well as beautiful tributes from other musicians.  Superb viewing.  Can't wait till I get The Young People's Concerts and so much more.",1408924800,3,697,5.017391304347826

3963591,5,B002OVB9Z8,"I was away at school when these programs originally aired so it's an extraordinary gift to be able to see them for the first time in their entirety. I'd always heard mention of the famous Bernstein line, ""three Gs and an E flat"" when discussing Beethoven's Fifth. Now I can finally hear those words myself. And his discussion of the history of American Musical Theatre - astounding, brilliant! Through these wonderful discs he lives on and teaches on, forever.",1376352000,4,460,4.8354430379746836

8376526,5,B002OVB9Z8,"I grew up on the ""Young People's Concerts"" in the 60s, and these broadcasts taught me even more, about such a variety of music -- jazz, ""modern"" music, musical comedy -- and a production of Handel's Messiah that's as innovative as ""Omnibus"" was, itself. The audio is excellent, without offering excuses for the era in which the shows were produced. (And as a British Columbian, it's amusing to see the commercial for ""Aluminium Industries"", mentioning Kitimat -- especially given how times have changed in the 60 years since.)",1468800000,2,526,4.988636363636363
8376527,5,B002OVB9Z8,"This DVD contains perhaps one of the most lucid descriptions of Jazz - from a listener's point of view - that I know of.

And still learning about music from one of the top musicians of the age--what a gift to have a man who deeply understands music share it with those of us who can only listen.",1453507200,5,466,4.765432098765432

8376530,5,B002OVB9Z8,"The Omnibus programs in the 1950's (I was born in '48) either caused or tapped into my love of the arts and music but I remember them fondly.  These Bernstein ones particularly impress me, and I am looking forward to others.  The reproduction is excellent--Lenny comes brilliantly through the b/w program full of animation and color generated by the Maestro.
