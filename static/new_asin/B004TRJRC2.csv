4465982,3,B004TRJRC2,Dissapointing DVD.  Watched it with 2 adults and 5 children and evern though it's relatively short a few of us dozed off.  The 3D is fair at best.  Didn't learn too much and it wasn't very entertaining.,1315612800,3,202,4.405405405405405
4465983,5,B004TRJRC2,We bought this blue-ray to test out the 3D features on our new Samsung 3D TV.  We were very impressed with the 3D quality.  It's not something we would watch over and over again but we were pleased with our purchase.,1315180800,,216,4.2439024390243905
4465984,1,B004TRJRC2,I have most of the 3d Imax from the best Imax hubble to this one which is the worst pretty much its one good 3d seen Jellyfish and a turtle whos telling the story Imax Under The Sea and Deep Sea are far better,1314403200,,209,3.772727272727273
4465985,5,B004TRJRC2,"This 3D Blu-ray DVD is a documentary, as you can probably tell by the title, and it is quite interesting to watch particularly in 3D. I know 3D TV is not for everyone; however, I personally happen to enjoy watching 3D TV very much and own over 24 3D Blu-ray DVDs. 3D adds a special quality to the subject at hand by presenting the topic almost as if you were there. This particular DVD I found to be very informative and educational. It's great for children and adults of all ages. I recommend you buy this DVD if you haven't yet.",1313712000,,530,4.257425742574258
4465986,5,B004TRJRC2,"This film, done by Jean-Michel Cousteau, is superb in so many ways! The 3D effects are just amazing! This IS the dvd that you will want to show off 3D to your guests; it is perfect as the medium to introduce 3D to people.  It is very tastefully done, and is not gory or full of violent shark attacks; rather, it shows sharks as the beautiful, magnificent creatures that they are.  A lot of fish and other sea life are depicted also.  It is full of splendid scenes that delight and amaze.  The music is excellent, as is the narration, giving this film a very classy feeling.  3D scenes, at least with our set, float way out into the living room with a vast amount of depth... adding to the ""being in the deep"" feeling of the film!

There are so many beautiful and dynamic species of sharks... some very unique in their appearance and functionality.  I hope that films like this help the world to see how valuable and endangered they truly are.  Mankind must turn away from being destroyers and turn to being caretakers... or some true, wondrous beauty will be gone forever.",1311638400,11,1072,4.461538461538462
4465987,5,B004TRJRC2,"This movie is why 3D was invented!  The effect of the 3D makes it feel as though you can literally reach out and touch the sharks, the turtles and the fish.  Even appearing to swim right up to you and you could reach out and touch all the creatures.  Visually stunning and the soundtrack is perfect for the movie.  The information on the different species of sharks is very informative and the up close visuals on the sharks is breath taking.  There is also a constant narrative (as the turtle) that keeps you interested in every aspect of what the turtle comes upon.  I will be ordering the Dolphins and Whales 3D since I loved the Sharks 3D so much.  You definitely feel as though you are right in the water with the cameraman yourself.",1310774400,5,738,4.4222222222222225
4465988,1,B004TRJRC2,"I wouldnt buy this movie unless you like other sea creatures as well!!! this is just not sharks, they didn't even cover all the sharks. they showed a real quick shot of the Great White but that was it! wasn't worth the money for me, 1 star",1309737600,4,239,4.1063829787234045
4465989,3,B004TRJRC2,"This documentary about sharks isn't very sharky. There are a lot of time spent showing other see creatures other than sharks. You start off with a sea turtle introducing himself and taking you on the shark tour. You get to see around five or six different kinds of sharks and learn a few facts about where they roam and what they eat, but I think I learned more about the creatures they ate rather than learning about the sharks themselves. The 3D effects are pretty cool to watch and sometimes it's like I'm looking through a window under water. The documentary is also pretty short coming around to about 42 minutes. If this was a DVD and not a 3D Blu Ray, I think the most I would pay for it would be $5. For this maybe $10.",1306627200,8,727,4.27536231884058
4465990,5,B004TRJRC2,"This video was the next best thing to being there with the sharks, the 3D movie seemed real, like really swimming with the sharks",1389744000,,129,4.416666666666667
4465991,5,B004TRJRC2,"Great 3D Blu-Ray.
Nice eye candy for the price. Shortly before I took delivery of my new LG 3D TV from Amazon, I bought a bunch of these short themed DVDs. The IMAX productions are well presented and really pop.",1384473600,2,211,4.3
4465992,3,B004TRJRC2,"I bought this DVD because I love sharks and wanted to see them on a 3D TV.  I was disappointed in both areas.  The 3D isn't as good as Amazing Ocean and you rarely see sharks!  The narration is obviously meant for children, not adults.  I expected better from a Cousteau.",1373932800,,271,4.254901960784314
4465993,5,B004TRJRC2,"Product arrived on time in secure packaging.
Wonderful clarity! Nice narration.
Background music is so peaceful
Feels as if you are actually swimming along side the animals.
Great 3D effects!",1359936000,,191,5.4
4465994,1,B004TRJRC2,"They had it for sale, but then after I paid, they sent me an email saying they were out of stock!  Bad business!",1359676800,2,112,3.869565217391304
4465995,3,B004TRJRC2,"This should not have been titles 'Sharks'.

Sharks make up probably less than a quarter of this show.  That also don't show most of the popular sharks (tiger, bull, lemon, mako, blue).  They spend too much time on other sea life.  It is still an enjoyable show, however the title is misleading.  There is one point where they go 10 plus minutes without showing or talking about sharks.",1357603200,,385,4.602941176470588
4465996,5,B004TRJRC2,"WOW!!!! This is exactly what you hope for when you see a 3D movie, fish filled the room , sharks came out at us, turtles floating before our eyes, and jelly fish slamming into our faces. It was non stop 3D action!!!!!! They should use this to demonstrate out good the 3D is. Me and my six yr old son both LOVED this!! If you have a 3d tv, you must have this!!!!",1356652800,,361,3.958904109589041
4465997,5,B004TRJRC2,this is one of the best 3-d out of screen dvds i have seen. i would say that at least 90percent of this dvd is out of screen and thats what i buy 3-d for. some of it comes as far as i sit from the tv and thats quite a ways. i did not find this boring and have watched it at least 3 times so far. i would definitely recommend this 3-d,1340668800,4,333,3.5135135135135136
4465998,1,B004TRJRC2,"Imax Under The Sea and some others had colorful backgrounds,i.e coral reefs,very colorful fish,ect. I figured out thats why this and Dolphins and Whales 3d didn't work for me. Ist the shark really isn't  colorful and he wasn't in this movie,dark,dull,with dark dull background. The most colorful scenes were of the sea turtle who does swim amongst some colorful reefs,but theses scenes were brief. The descriptions of each shark was very brief,such a magnificent animal is deserving of much more. I would advise to pass on this and Dolphins and Whales 3d. Poor 3d,poor color of animals(dark underwater environment) and background and half-hearted effort describing each shark species. Had the makers filmed the sharks swimming in colorful reefs,instead of dark,murky waters it might have helped -a little.",1339804800,4,805,5.338582677165355
4465999,1,B004TRJRC2,"As a 3D production, I was extremely disappointed. The content was acceptable, but it certainly was not what I expected in quality for a 3D production.",1316390400,8,150,4.8076923076923075

8440825,5,B004TRJRC2,"I have to say I really loved this. I just watched it with my girlfriend's nine year old and he wanted to pet the sharks and rub the seal's tummies. The underwater photography on this is phenomenal. The images are as sharp as anything I have ever watched. The oceans are so clear and you can see the most minute details as the sharks swim by.

Underwater photography is perfect for 3D viewing and this movie is a showcase of it. The depth and multiple layers of fish are just incredible.

If I had a gripe, it would have been to have a few more species of sharks represented, and perhaps show a few more attacks on seals or something. As is, it is perfect for children of all ages to view, but for a guy that has seen every single special on ""shark week,"" it comes across as a bit tame. However, this is a minor quibble. The high definition and 3D are so good that I didn't mind.

I've seen some bad reviews on this and all I can say is maybe these folks either don't have a good set up or can't look past the elementary narration. I have about 10 3D movies and this is the one I'd show off my 3D with.

I hope we can get more 3D documentaries of this caliber. Save our sharks!",1401321600,2,1176,4.077922077922078
8440826,1,B004TRJRC2,"1.  You learn about other animals far more than sharks.
2.  No 3D ""pop"" - no fish swimming around in your living room, you're just looking through a window - AGAIN.
3.  You buy a shark show to watch sharks act like sharks, not act like whales.
4.  Sharks + 3D are SUPPOSED to equal shredded guts floating around in my TV room.  Epic fail on both counts.
5.  From the perspective of a turtle?  Are you serious?",1398988800,,409,4.166666666666667
8440827,5,B004TRJRC2,"Best 3-D effects that I've seen thus far on any blu-ray. If you love 3-D, this is a must have. The aquatic life comes directly into your room, especially the jellyfish. You will enjoy this one!",1398384000,2,193,4.388888888888889
8440828,5,B004TRJRC2,A great 3D for everyone!  It came just as we had family over and we all thoroughly enjoyed it! Thanks,1391990400,,101,4.05
