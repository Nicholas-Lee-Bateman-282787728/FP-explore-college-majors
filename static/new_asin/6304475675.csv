884853,2,6304475675,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loved looking at it over and over.  It is set up so we could stop it at any point. I like the ""true to life"" photos, not some purple thing trying to entertain. In addition it is calm, but interesting, so when there was an unusual  level of activity at the lake, he could relax and watch a little of this with grandpa and fall off to sleep.",1378598400,,387,3.8860759493670884

884858,5,6304475675,"Our whole family has enjoyed these series.  My now-9 yr old loved it when he was two and still enjoys watching it with his 2 year old brother.  Our older son loves nature and animals and grew up on these National geographic kids videos, now in DVD format.  The songs are fun and catchy for the kids and a great way to learn about the world in a a fun way.  I think some people need to lighten up about the songs.  This is not supposed to be music from the National Symphony Orchestra.  These videos/dvd's are designed for children and they seem to really enjoy the funny songs.  We would love to get a CD of just the songs, because my husband and I enjoy them so much.",1274054400,6,668,4.131782945736434

7872137,3,6304475675,Good video for kids however I had planned to use it as a homeschool supplement and it's just not detailed enough for that.  Covers some vocabulary which is nice but jumps from one animal group to the next without actually talking much about them.
