8444789,5,B000AAJ218,"I've always been a recreational basketball player and never really had much formal training, but I really wanted to improve my ballhandling. In buying this DVD, it's opened up a whole world of ballhandling drills and moves. The technical instruction is pretty detailed, and breaks down the moves and what you need to pay attention to. Would definitely recommend this series for anyone.",1253750400,4,385,5.126984126984127
8444790,4,B000AAJ218,I bought this DVD along with the latest Better One on One Offense (which i highly recommend).  This DVD gives you so many drills to practice and do that I have never even thought of!  It shows you when to use the move and in what situation.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to improve their ball handling!,1168041600,11,319,4.19672131147541
