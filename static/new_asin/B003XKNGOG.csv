4216995,2,B003XKNGOG,"I'm up for documentaries in film, like I'm up for non fiction in books.  So, I watched this on a lark.

I was hoping to learn something about the porn industry and maybe get some sort of overview or in-depth study into some area of it.  Instead I got only personal stories from people who are involved at different (but mundane) levels.  These include:  a porn chick rattling off prices she is paid for different acts on film, some lawyers who work with battered women speculating that failure to live up to porn can be a trigger, and a college student talking about how porn affected his view to women during middle school when he first encountered porn and women.

This movie is very anti porn.  I don't disagree with that position, but don't feel that this movie at all reinforced or challenged any of my views.  Instead this movie wasted my time.  Anecdotes by people in the industry can be spun all different ways.  In fact, one of the women making violent violent rape porn seems to take a positive view on it (she started in college, and now runs her own small business).  The movie also samples porn to highlight racist porn, rape porn, torture porn, porn using young looking women to make them look like children, computer simulated child porn, granny porn, etc.  This has the same problem.  I've never heard of any of these porn movies before, and I know there is an overwhelming lot of porn, so I don't know whether this is normal run-of-the-mill porn or whether these are novelty movies meant as gag gifts or for a small audience.  I tend to think this is the case.)

Whether you love or hate porn, I recommend skipping this.  Hopefully, someone else will post a review that points you to a well done documentary on porn.",1318896000,3,1733,4.52411575562701
4216996,3,B003XKNGOG,"Is the first thing I did on my birthday was watch a documentary on porn?!?  Whelp, I guess it was!!!

I've often heard that it's difficult to get porn makers and anti-porn activists in the same room.  The idea is that they are so glued to their position that they can't even walk in their opponent's shoes.  As a person who would roll over and die if porn didn't exist, it can be difficult to listen to the other side, but it is possible.  So this work does interview both sides of the debate.  Still, if you look closely, it still falls on the anti-porn side of the meter.

For example, one of the first images you see is a young woman saying, ""I found my dad's porn stash and it immediately made me think that Daddy must not find Mom and I attractive.""  Well, why wasn't that followed up with a person of either gender saying, ""I remember finding my Dad's porn stash and it was the greatest discovery of my life!!""?  One of the few times that race is brought up is when an anti-porn British academic condemns porn that has racial fetishization in it.  Well, why was there no one pointing out that you see more interracial couples in porn flicks than you ever do in mainstream film and television?  Why was there nobody interviewed who could say interracial porn can be an attack on or challenge to racial segregation and former anti-miscegenation laws?  The doc ends with a talk on torture porn.  Why did this work never speak of female directors who are trying to make porn from the female viewer's perspective or preferences?

This work emphasizes that the porn industry makes a ton of money.  It says Disney and many ""wholesome"" mainstream outlets actually have their hand in it too.  However, they never speak of how the industry is on shaky grounds.  Porn gets pirated a lot and thus the profit has gone down.  Move over, Napster!  Plus, with the internet there's more everyday people who are producing porn and distributing it for free.  On facebook, TV, print articles, several porn stars have said they don't make half as much as they did before 1995 or so.  There are people who drive Jaguars and would refuse to drive hoopties.  However, many porn watchers have proved that the cheap stuff is just as good as the finely-produced stuff because both help to result in a sticky conclusion!  This work has an anti-capitalist slant to it, but there are ways in which this industry is starting to be for the masses and not for the dollars.

HERE IS AN IMPORTANT FINAL POINT!!!  The work STARTS with writing saying ""This work is about porn produced for heterosexual males.""  From jump, it leaves all-male porn to the side.  Now I appreciate that a work recognizes its heterocentricity as opposed to making that trait an unspoken, universal given.  However, it really points to a huge flaw in ideas from anti-porn feminists.  ANTI-PORN ACTIVISTS CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE MANY RAINBOW-FLAG MEN WHO HAS SAID MALE PORN WAS LIBERATORY TO THEM!  Those activists focus on sexism, domination, harming women in their condemnation.  But they don't or can't account for rainbow-flag men who say, ""I was ashamed of myself until I saw male porn.""  ""I thought I was a bad, dirty person until I saw men doing it on film.""  ""All-guy porn helped me to stop hating myself."" Etc.  They also can't account for sapphic-produced work like ""Off Our Backs.""  They can't address porn chicks who speak proudly and openly of being attracted to and working sexually with other women.

This would be an interesting work to show in a course on human sexuality.  I can't think of many docs that expose both sides.  Still, I must emphasize, I think this work's goal is to make viewers hate porn.  And let's just say, that ain't gonna happen any time soon for most of us.",1318723200,6,3741,4.602118003025718

8408184,5,B003XKNGOG,"I saw this movie last night at UT Austin. There was a discussion afterwards with the audience and the committed students who fought for a year to be able to show it. Professor Robert Jensen led the discussion as he participated in the making of it.

Professor Jensen had to keep circling the audience participants back to the fact that this film is based on feminism in the current patriarchal culture. He stated that pornography is about capitalism and patriarchy.

In his words, how can a solution be created and presented to a culture who doesn't see this as a problem? Not just for women, but men also.

This documentary traumatized me. I had a hard time getting to sleep last night. But I'm glad for it. I choose to expose myself to extreme truths that will educate me. Even if it is in a painful, horrifying way. I refuse to remain ignorant and hide my head in the sand.
It's says a lot about our culture when a person speaks out against pornography. A man is considered weak and not a real man. Women are called prudes and ""sex negative"".

My shock ramped up continuously throughout the viewing. I ended in tears of anger, empathy for all involved, and fear. Is this where our society is going?  Pushing towards the edge more and more to keep their audience and money coming in?

The last scenes of women being violently used and then flashing to official descriptions of torture were mind blowing. They were the same!  The thought of men masturbating to that terrifies me.

To quote Gail Dines author of Pornland, and interviewed for the film:
""People say to me, ""But if you're against pornography, are you against sex?"" That's like me saying to me, if I'm critical of McDonald's, I'm against eating.""

Watch this and open your mind",1397174400,6,1740,4.587096774193548
8408185,5,B003XKNGOG,"Loved this documentary because of it's honest and raw portrayal of the porn industry. I liked the fact it was not censored too much because it's got shock value. I found myself deeply disturbed by it and rightly so. It not only talks about the industry's flaws but it talks about society's flaw: We allow money to dictate right and wrong. I'm all for capitalism but there must be some limit to it when it damages people and relationships. If we are honest with ourselves and don't get caught up in ""free speech at any cost"" argument, we can see how unregulated porn has gone down a slippery slope. It's gotten more and more graphic and violent as the years pass. We wonder how a woman in India was gang raped last month....well...gang rape was unheard of in India before the internet age. Humans become what we think about....this is a fact of nature. We should really take a cold hard look at what is becoming of our world today. One day we will wake up, but it will probably be too late.",1357171200,7,989,4.409836065573771
8408186,5,B003XKNGOG,"This documentary is important work. We need to be aware of the reality of what porn is. It is not ""fantasy"". The women are real. The sexual violence and rape they endure is real. The women in porn are not there out of ""free will"". Women in the sex industry are there out of either a last resort, coercion, or by force. This is the reality, people do not want to hear it, but it's the truth whether you want to believe it or not.
Children are turning to porn as sex education. The results are children raping younger children, an all time high of STDs, high rates of domestic abuse between teens and college aged people, among others. Scientific evidence is blooming everywhere on the devastation of porn and addiction in people of all ages.
This is an awkward subject and whether we realize it or not this affects all of us. Adults need to discuss this as well as parents to their children.
To get a more thorough understanding of the reality of porn, consider reading Big Porn Inc by Melinda Tankard Reist. It is a compiliation of essays written by scholars and exited women from the industry; people from all over the world seeing the extreme harms from this industry. It is the newest among many books on this subject.",1346889600,4,1221,4.479820627802691
8408187,5,B003XKNGOG,"I'm not anti sex or a prude. But it looks to me what goes on in mainstream popular porn is not just innocent harmless sex. I don't see any independent empowered liberated feminists taking control of their sexuality. All I see is millions of dumb, naive, desperate, and or obviously traumatized  sexually abused females being taken advantage of by mainly white male porn producers/pimps making millions of dollars off of pimping  females. The women do all the work doing messed up degrading things for very little money compared to the millions the porn producer makes.

I don't understand why people are hating on this film, it makes a lot of valid points and has the video clips to back up their arguments. Porn, particularly american porn is obviously white male supremist racist and misogynist.

I just don't see how a woman being paid so a strange man can ejaculate  on her face on camera or being used as a sex doll is uplifting to women.

I think the people who wrote  bad reviews are white male porn producers who just want to keep pimping women for millions of dollars.",1342224000,17,1077,4.666666666666667
8408188,1,B003XKNGOG,"I recently went on a documentary binge and after tons of great shows I came to this trash.  I thought it might at least be mildly interesting, but it wasn't even close.  The film features random sex scenes with nerds talking about how awful and immoral everything is.  Why have very unattractive boring people evaluate sex?  Sure they can have their opinion on it, but I simply don't care what they have to say!  At one point there is a ugly guy talking about after he gets off watching porn that he feels so bad for the porn actress as she is on her knees in front of some men.  Seriously guy?  You just got off to that!  Why not just stop being a big baby about sex and stop being ashamed of what you like?  This documentary is absolute trash and is hardly even at high school project level.  Save yourselves the time and don't watch this!",1341100800,4,841,4.265822784810126
8408189,2,B003XKNGOG,"I understand the motive for producing a film such as this and I am glad someone is trying to.  For that, I applause the producer(s).  However, it could have been done more tactfully.  The images could have been more blurred, the cuss words could have been bleeped out.  Ultimately, it does not make since how a documentary about the negative implications of porn on someones psyche and on a society can include so many pictures of naked women and porn scenes that it might as well be a porn movie itself.  Isn't it showing people the exact thing that they are trying to persuade people not watch?

Therefore, I eventually had to turn the documentary off ten minutes before the end.  The only reason I watched it that long was because I understood the heart of what the producer was trying to get across and supported that.  I felt quite grossed out by all the vulgar images.  Maybe the producers were using those grotesk movie clips for shock value.  However, those watching porn already will not be shocked by it.  Those who don't watch porn will be.  Maybe the producer was trying to evoke action against the porn industry.  SUGGESTION: If you do not want to see porn, don't watch this documentary as it is full of porn clips.",1325116800,4,1228,4.552511415525114
8408190,3,B003XKNGOG,"While ""The Price of Pleasure"" is certainly flawed, I found it a worthwhile watch.

Yes, I would have liked it to be more coherent with main points and messages, but I nevertheless believe it succeeds in communicating a serious problem. Beware that the presentation is often very graphic (though blurred in ""extreme"" cases) by mainstream U.S. standards, but don't let it drive you away: there's an importance in actually seeing the terrible things people subject other people to. It brings a greater gravity to the issue that can be lost in mainstream news exposs. (To be clearer: there is very graphic material that mature adults can handle -- though likely detest -- but children and immature teens/young adults should not be exposed. The message/discussion potential would be lost on such immaturity, and the intensely sexual material could be psychologically traumatic.)

It's vexing to read so many reviews (see Netflix for more) that dismiss this documentary as garbage, or utterly unfair, or even Christian propaganda. (I'd consider myself an atheist, and it didn't strike me as Christian propaganda.) Several times in the film there are opinions and statements advocating pornography. I believe such advocacy arguments are representative of what many -- if not most -- supporters think and say. (I've heard some of those arguments, myself.) A ""pro-porn"" side is presented. In my opinion, what's presented are not very debate-tested or nuanced arguments; they fall easily to the anti-pornography points. I understand that it angers people when they believe their ideas aren't given a fair shake. If you've got better to support violent or especially immoral pornography, then offer an enlightening, nuanced position -- instead of a resentful, toxic blurb or diatribe.

Point: while the coherence of the film's message is a bit sloppy (mixed messages against general pornography and violent or especially immoral (e.g., virtual child) pornography), I believe they present a fine case that there's an awful trend that society needs to wake up to.

Perhaps the strength of this documentary lies not in the film per se, but in its potential for discussion -- there's a boatload of points where you could pause and discuss at length. Regardless of whether you believe pornography has a legitimate place in society, I believe this film speaks more so to a more significant issue -- the trending towards accepting sexual violence (oftentimes truly extreme), even if it's ""fantasy"".

Think there's nothing wrong with pornography that depicts (promotes) extreme sexual violence and abuse? Think it's just fantasy that's wholly distinct from reality? It's ideas; ideas transcend fantasy and work their way into reality, even if in ways you're not expecting. It's clear that some pornographers are gaining ground in promoting the very worst of ideas.

This film's not great, but, for conscientious viewers, it's something to discuss and meditate on.",1323993600,4,2944,5.27991452991453
8408191,1,B003XKNGOG,This one really walks the fine line between being a documentary and being straight up anti porn propaganda. The bias is blatant which is one of the few things that I thought were positive about it. The subject matter is all over the place and they can't seem to dig in to any subject at length. Really really bad stuff.,1322870400,4,319,4.333333333333333
