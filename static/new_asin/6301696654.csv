8164480,4,6301696654,"this is for James Bond readers and movie goers. I wish I knew more about the story. Does ""Spymaker..."" portend Bond or is Bond used to tell Fleming's story",1370563200,,155,4.379310344827586
8164481,5,6301696654,"Very unique video on life of Ian Fleming - where the James Bond series came from.  Never upgraded to a DVD, so VHS or nothing.  Only film I'm aware of starring Jason Connery vs his father (the star of the original James Bond movies).",1356480000,,233,4.2727272727272725
8164482,5,6301696654,"The quality of the VHS tape was excellent.  The movie itself is superior.  Jason Connery would have been a great James Bond in other films as well. He is charasmatic just like his father. A must have for the James Bond buff.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spymaker-The-Secret-Life-of-Ian-Fleming-VHS/dp/6301696654/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spymaker - The Secret Life of Ian Fleming [VHS</a>]",1293494400,,430,7.09433962264151
8164483,5,6301696654,"If you have not read any of Ian Flemmings books,  this movie is the best way to see how The James Bond character came to fruition.  Excellent movie to top off your James Bond collection and who better to play the role of Ian Flemming than the son of one of most well loved Bonds of them all Sean Connery.  Jason Connery is superb.  This movie is a gem.",1014768000,5,352,4.057971014492754
8164484,5,6301696654,"Jason Connery (Sean Connery's son) plays a young, witty Ian Fleming who learns the world of espionage.  Kristin Scott Thomas (Random Hearts) portrays Ian's sexy mentor.  Learn how James Bond got all his habits (good and bad).  Spymaker is just that, the making of the world's most favorite spy.  All the adventure, sex and humor of a Bond movie.  Spymaker is a must-have for the Bond collector!",1003104000,2,394,4.82089552238806
8164485,4,6301696654,"A fast paced entertaining video biography of the late Ian Fleming (author of the original James Bond novels and short stories). Having read several actual biographies on Fleming, one should be cautioned that much of the  peripheral info in this film has been reverse incorporated from the later  Bond FILMS into this video. Fleming, I believe, only saw one Bond film (Dr.  No) and died during or just following the shooting of the second (From  Russia with Love). The fascinating part would be knowing just how much  information came from Sean Connery to his son Jason to play this role (Ian  Fleming). Sean Connery and Ian Fleming hit it off quite well at the start  of the Bond series, and because of Goldfinger - Connery actually started  playing golf!",925430400,11,755,4.7984496124031
