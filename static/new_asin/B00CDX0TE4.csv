8580673,5,B00CDX0TE4,"PLOT: ORIG a TV movies but later made into a movie and later became the FBI tv series subplot: 3 top scientists/engineers are part of the new ultra secret missile project find a bomb on their private jet.

1960s and Quinn Martin the king of 1960s thrillers produced this ~ 3 scientist part of a ""nasa"" type missile project all have top security clearance. But a bomb is found on their private jet. The narrated docudrama approach is very effective as we have the ""crime"" set up and then we also see a few choice motives like the cheating wife of one of the scientists and her BOY TOY lover (Jack Cassiday) or is it a foreign power trying to derail our space program?  excellent plot by crime police reporter Stanley Niss flows. We also see behind the scenes of the FBI who piece the puzzle of the crime together in fast time. excellent and good cast ~ Jack Cassiday, Andrew Duggan and we spot lots of small time stars. 5 STARS all the way. Better than I ever expected.",1371081600,6,968,4.372222222222222
