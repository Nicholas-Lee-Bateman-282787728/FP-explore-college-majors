8118198,4,B000F6ZBRG,"A really great beginners introduction to this case and very informative details. Bill Kurtis is an excellent narrator for this episode with a great voice. This whole episode is very creepy and eerie with some eerie music to go along with it that really sets the tone and especially when they go inside the house and show what happened and where. Great quality picture on this DVD and good sound as well. Again, if your new to this case and want to learn the basics of it, it's a great DVD and purchase. I highly recommend it.",1341014400,3,525,4.422680412371134
8118199,5,B000F6ZBRG,I do not own this DVD but have seen it.  I would recommend it for people who are interested in the JBR case but are not acquainted with many of the details or history of the case.  It would be a great introduction to the sensational case.  I had an erie feeling as the host walked through the empty Ramsay house.  It has been empty since the murder happened in l996.  The host of the documentary is a master at telling a true crime story.,1319155200,6,438,4.105882352941176
