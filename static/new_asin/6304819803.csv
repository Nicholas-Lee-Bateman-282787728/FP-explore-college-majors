7878783,5,6304819803,"A towering achievement.  Don't miss it!  Hardly ever shown in theaters, but should be.  No soundtrack album but there should be one.  Shot in grainy black and white, set in NYC's Lower East Side circa 1980, Rhythm Thief tells the tale of a hard-luck music bootlegger/street peddler living in squalor while being pursued by numerous memorable characters-some friends, some foes. It is frightening, tragic, heavily melodramatic, darkly comedic, sweetly romantic, and densely atmospheric.  The entire production is distinguished by vivid performances, eye-popping handheld camera work, flashpoint editing, and a depth of ambiance seldom achieved in films produced with 100x more budget than director Matthew Harrison had.access to. Finesse trumps $$$!",1400112000,,748,5.763636363636364
7878784,5,6304819803,"Movies have rarely, if ever depicted New York City streets with more biting honesty than Rhythm Thief.  An Astounding film by brilliant filmmaker Matthew Harrison.  A petty thief finds a unique way to surivive on the street of lower Manhattan.  Harrison's watchful eye never fliches from the truth of what a man will do when he's desperate and willing.  This film should be part of any film enthusiast collection.",1005264000,3,413,4.942028985507246
