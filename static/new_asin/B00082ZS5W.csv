2257025,5,B00082ZS5W,"Dido is even better live than in her albums. She's more versatile and shows a variance in tempo in all her songs. One moment that stands out is when she's singing 'White Flag' where, towards the end of the song, the crowd starts singing along,she stops, and the crowd finishes the song. That was really amazing. The best performances were: White Flag,Thank you, and Do you have a little time.",1121990400,,392,4.614285714285714
2257026,5,B00082ZS5W,"Loved this live dvd, Dido is at her best, the vocals, the band and did i mention dido were all very, very good and i recommend this to everyone who is a fan.",1121731200,,157,3.787878787878788
2257027,5,B00082ZS5W,"Having released two albums that have sold by the truckload - ""No Angel"" and ""Life for Rent"" - this is Dido's first live offering : a DVD and a CD looking back to three dates played at London's Brixton Academy in August 2004.

The DVD features 17 tracks - 9 of them lifted from ""Life for Rent"" while the remaining 8 appeared on ""No Angel"". With the exception of ""This Land is Mine"" and ""My Lover's Gone"", all my favourite Dido songs appear are here. It opens with ""Stoned"", and the Roswell High song, ""Here With Me"". The stories behind ""See You When You're 40"", ""Life for Rent"", ""Mary's in India"" and ""Sand in my Shoes"" are briefly told - though, where appropriate, the names have been omitted to protect the 'innocent'. Unfortunately, nothing was said on the story behind ""Isobel"" - I've always been curious about that one. Meanwhile, the famously sampled ""Thank You"" and, to a lesser extent, ""White Flag"" get the 'big song-along' treatment.

It may seem an odd thing to say, given that she is a professional performer, but Dido does seem to be very comfortable on-stage. Unlike some artists I've seen, there's no obvious signs of ego, general vanity or grumpiness - the intros and links between the songs seen more like an informal chat. The camera work and the lighting are excellent, while there are a couple of characters in the band - Keith Golden, the bass guitarist, appears to be one of those kids who likes doing his own thing. There's also (if you look closely) an appearance by Animal from ""The Muppet Show""...

The CD features 12 of the tracks from the concert, and lasts for nearly an hour. ""Don't Leave Home"", ""Do You Have a Little Time"", ""Hunter"", ""My Life"" and (oddly, I thought) ""All You Want"" are the five songs that were dropped, while the intros also missed the cut. Without the 'distractions' of the stage show, the CD emphasises just how good Dido is live.

Neither the CD nor the DVD contain any new material, so I wouldn't expect this release to win any new fans - if you hated ""No Angel"" and ""Life for Rent"" there's really no point in buying this. However, if you're a fan, it's definitely recommended. Slip it into your DVD player, rest your feet on your coffee-table and enjoy !",1121644800,,2205,4.5465994962216625
2257028,5,B00082ZS5W,"Dido has 2 cd's out with all great songs on them, she now puts out a concert dvd that is incredible, the future looks bright for this hot young lady!!  This dvd is great, the audio is un-believable and the video is just fine(I can't believe anybody would complain about it).  I own over 100 concert dvd's and this dvd ranks right up the their with one of my favorites. All I can say is if you like even one Dido song, you should get this dvd/cd and you will be surprised how unbelievably talented Dido really is!  She should be a lot more popular in the US than she is.",1119398400,6,569,4.108108108108108
2257029,5,B00082ZS5W,This is an excellent DVD. I have all of Dido's Cd's. But I have to say seeing her life is just great. She harmonizes great with her band. And she comes across very honest and alive. Great interaction with the audience. I collect music DVD's and this is the first DVD I watched two times in a row. I love it.,1119398400,2,307,4.049180327868853
2257030,5,B00082ZS5W,"I have to admit it, I love Dido's music, her first album No Angel was brilliant, and Life for Rent second album really grew on me and is a favorite on my playlist.

This concert CD is a pleasure to watch, her concert performance is inspired, with just enough changes/tweaks to her songs that even though I've practically memorized her songs, it was new and refreshing. The picture quality was a bit soft played on 100"" projector screen, but it kind of works in light of her musical style. The bonus of an Audio CD in the package is great, and makes this a great value. The sound quality of the CD is decent for a concert live CD. It's not the clearest sounding live CD, but the overall tonally balance is listenable.

Dido's performance was great on this DVD, and watching her performance makes me love her music even more. A must for a Dido fan.",1119398400,2,846,4.382165605095541
2257031,3,B00082ZS5W,"I like everything I've heard by Dido. She has a great, smoky voice and all of her songs performed here are deeply beautiful. It's good to finally see how she is in a live setting. Unfortunately, the widescreen image is heavily processed with a soft focus throughout, which I detest. Still, she looks terrific and the audio quality is generally good. Mmmm, and I especially love her performance here of ""Take My Hand"" - I wouldn't mind being her ""microphone"" during it, ohhhhhh baby.....

BEWARE!!! ATTENTION!!! READ THIS!! - DO NOT LOAD THE LIVE MUSIC CD INTO YOUR PC. IT CONTAINS SUNNCOMM / MEDIAMAX SONYBMG ROOTKIT SPYWARE, WHICH WILL SCREW YOUR SYSTEM UP! DAMN THESE COMPANIES TO HELL!",1119398400,6,688,4.830508474576271
2257032,4,B00082ZS5W,"Dido's new live dvd/cd combo doesn't pack a walloping punch in the visuals department, but the vocals are impressive. Dido does a great job of reinventing some of her songs to give them a better sound when performed live. However, a few of the songs don't lend well to being performed outside of the studio. All in all, this is a great value pack, as you get the dvd and cd combined for one low price. Standout tracks include: See You When You're 40, Hunter, Take My Hand, Don't Leave Home and Sand In My Shoes. Casual fans should enjoy this performance, but diehards will want to know who gave the Brixton Academy audience a sleeping pill before the show started. Come on y'all, she's a hometown girl...show her some love!!!!!",1118793600,4,727,4.557251908396947
2257033,5,B00082ZS5W,"It is of fantanstic quality and it sounds wonderful. This is a DVD for Dido Fans and those who have also just discovered her.

2257043,5,B00082ZS5W,"This performance is awesome! Dido and the whole group are ""on"" here, and I love her songs from her first albums, and all the ones on this DVD. There's so much power and presence when the she is performing White Flag (in particular but not only) and the crowd is right there with her singing every word. Her voice is so unique, pretty, yet strong at the same time, and the subject matter of her songs speak to the heart of real people in everyday life. My genre of choice in music usually runs a bit to the harder side, but when I heard White Flag for the first time while listening to a Russian radio station on the internet that played it, I was intrigued by her style and had to hear more. When I put this in the player and watched it, I was absolutely blown away. Although her work after this has not been as interesting to me, but is still good, but the material on this DVD has become a permanent part of my musical heart.",1424390400,2,927,4.155555555555556

2257052,5,B00082ZS5W,"This is a very valuable treasure to own.  This was a magnificent concert captured beautifully on this DVD. Dido puts such energy and passion into each song and is quite charming and funny throughout the performance.  The stage light visuals are stunning and add to the overall ambiance.  Dido is such a beautiful woman with the voice of an Angel and it is such a thrill to see the audience enjoying it so much and singing along. She gives us one of the most memorable and classic performance of all time when she sings ""White Flag"" marking her as one of the pure musical geniuses of our time.  This DVD is highly recommended and gave me goose bumps.",1394323200,,649,4.47457627118644

2257057,5,B00082ZS5W,"I am into Dido's music because it is different. Great melodies and arrangements with innovative use of percussion. The DVD did not have the frantic two second cuts and scene changes you are used to seeing. I could get lost in the performance, it made me feel like I was in the audience, seeing it live. Dido is a beautiful, captivating performer who doesn't seem to carry the large ego of others.",1377993600,,396,4.513888888888889
2257058,4,B00082ZS5W,I saw this video on TV and I wanted to have the disc to use anytime I wanted.  The sound is excellent and seeing Dido perform makes it worthwhile.,1375142400,,146,4.0344827586206895
2257059,5,B00082ZS5W,Dido is wonderful on stage.  This DVD is extremely well done.  It is as though I was at the concert.  On top of that I got an audio CD in with the DVD.,1372896000,,151,3.515151515151515
2257060,5,B00082ZS5W,"I just finished watching the DVD and am now listening to the CD of Dido Live.  I have always enjoyed listening to her studio CDs, but watching the DVD from this live performance completely captured my attention in a different way.  First of all, her band, which includes both a percussionist and a drummer, as well as a guitarist, a bassist, and a keyboardist, was excellent, and  flat out jammed throughout the concert.  Secondly, Dido's personal attachment to all of the songs was quite obvious, due in part to her poignant introductions to many of them.  Thirdly, her live performance was very natural, free from any pretension or staged choreography, which was very enjoyable.  Lastly, if you are not familiar with Dido, but like Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries, you will love this compilation.  Highly recommended.",1369958400,2,826,5.029411764705882
2257061,5,B00082ZS5W,"I thought I wrote a review of this back when it came out, but I realized recently I didn't. Better late than never, even though it seems it may be out of print currently. Never the less, if you are interested in this, I can't recommend it enough. I still watch it periodically when the mood strikes, 8 years on! Seems to me Dido's studio recordings are a bit over produced and instrumentally lifeless. I've never gotten to see her perform in person, so I was pleasantly surprised that she is fantastic live. Assuming the video doesn't have any post production vocal trickery (no evidence of that that I saw), Dido's voice sounds just as good live as in studio. It's the musicians and live arrangements that really make this concert special, though. The energy and honesty that these songs acquire in concert is amazing. This energy, combined with the extended and modified arrangements make this exactly what a live performance should be: exciting and fun! Technically, the sound is great and nothing about the picture or videography distracts.",1369008000,2,1044,4.837988826815643
2257062,4,B00082ZS5W,"I would make this a five star rating, but, when I first put it in my DVD player it wouldn't play. Come to find out that I had to set my DVD player to a different region to play this DVD. Other than that, the DVD is awesome if you like Dido.",1358380800,,240,3.6346153846153846
2257063,5,B00082ZS5W,"Nice collection of songs including hits like White Flag and Thank You. Just a straightforward concert of great music, that distinct Dido voice and good musicianship.  No fancy wardrobe, elevated stages, leaping about (not that I don't like that from time to time with the right band); just one nice song after the other.

Dido does a little intro before some of the songs explaining the origin or a little about it -- nice touch.

There are some audio imperfections here and there, but nothing to worry about.  Just a slight drop or change in volume or equalization as the engineers spliced together various clips.  Most folks won't even notice.

I heartily recommend this DVD if you have any interest in Dido's music or career.  She truly stands out as a fine songwriter.  I enjoy these live songs as much or more than the studio versions.  She sticks quite close to the studio version, as much as you can live, but there are a few surprises, like the last half of See You When You're Forty -- rock on!  And Honestly OK -- jam on!

If you're a die-hard metal or rap fan, well, maybe this isn't your cup of tea.  Otherwise, this DVD won't disappoint.",1329523200,4,1150,4.529126213592233
2257064,5,B00082ZS5W,"Do it for the Band! This band Cooks!!! Great Show with Excellent editing. The songs go well beyond the studio recordings with far extended and outstanding renditions. A Must See for any who love a good Rock Show.

And then the icing on the cake, Love her sweet charming voice. But she's forceful with it a lot of the time with tingling effect. Then you learn about her as the show goes with her frank, honesty and revealing stories and such. What a charming and wonderfully talented singer and songwriter. And guys, if you think it's not gonna happen, be prepared to have your heart stolen. She is Pure!

I never knew anything of Dido prior to this viewing other than her name. It's made me a fan for life with this one output. I couldn't stop wanting to arrange one of my weekend nights into a Dido night.

And the plus here is the Concert on CD!! The downside is you don't get all songs from the DVD and one is shortened. ( Some might think It's a good song to shorten. I always miss it, though ). But still works during the day when sitting down is not an option.

This is in my Top 5 concert videos at the moment. Everyone deserves to attain their best frame of mind and experience this well capture concert. i understand how it was shot over 3 different concerts and all. Well Bravo! Love the Results.",1322265600,3,1306,4.318367346938776

2257069,5,B00082ZS5W,"Dido's music speaks for itself; if you like it, you will certainly love this DVD. I for one found that I enjoyed the music even better when seeing/hearing it performed live. For one thing, Dido herself has great on-stage presence when she sings (much less so for her between-song chats, but those are easily forwarded past). She can make a song come alive by her delivery, in a way the CD alone could never do justice. And if you're one of those who finds her visually stunning, well, let's just say there is plenty here to be stunned by. :-)  The lighting on many of the numbers is creatively done.

But visuals aside, the musical performance itself is outstanding. It's a treat to be able to watch the band members in action (the drummer in particular, and also lead guitar). And many of the songs are greatly expanded from their album versions, in almost every case much to their advantage. The bonus CD included in the case is great because it allows you to listen to these expanded versions. My favorite is ""Isobel,"" which absolutely rocks in the DVD (but comes out rather bland in the album version).",1274400000,2,1106,4.58080808080808

2257072,5,B00082ZS5W,"Dido, who first caught my eye when a few years she put down a haunting and mesmerizing track on an Eminem  rap  entry, is now an international superstar. Her stage presence, the sometimes gloomy content of her material and the feature she retains of being fit and energetic all adds up to her aura of enthusiastic and then sometimes blue eyed soul aspect of her delivery. Of note is Lily Allen, also another UK phenomenon that continues to take on the world. If you are old enough to remember Dusty Springfield and the effect she had on her motley ethnic audience we have to assume that there is something in the water in the UK that has always been responsible for astounding musical ability and talent. This DVD exemplifies that idea and is produced perfectly because I know that Dido has precise management all though does not overdo the PR. FYI, if you wish, I have posted another Dido review recently on my Amazon reviewer site should you wish additional opinion and information.

The concert is filmed in 1.78:1 anamorphic, not 4:3 pan & scan as Amazon's site incorrectly states.  For those of you with a newer 16:9 TV, this means no black bars.  The video completely fills the screen without requiring the use of your TV's horrible Stretch, Zoom, or Squeeze modes that end up distorting the picture and detracting from the overall viewing experience.  And unlike many concert videos that I own, Dido's concert is filmed entirely in the same aspect ratio.  So there isn't a crazy mixture of 4:3 video cameras and crappy Hi-8 hand-held cam footage being spliced into the main video.  The video bit-rate seems very high, making this standard definition disc (480p) look incredible even when upconverted for viewing on my 1080p plasma set.  I don't even own an upconverting DVD player.  I'm just using a 7-yr old, standard def progressive scan DVD player and allowing my TV's internal scaler to upconvert the video.  There are no artifacts or motion blur typically associated with poorly encoded DVDs, especially concert DVDs where it appears the level of professionalism is extremely low.  If you've ever seen ""Alanis Morissette, Jagged Little Pill, Live"" then you know what I'm talking about.

There are no dvd Extras or Special features on this disc.  Those omissions provided more disc space for the HQ video and also allowed the producer to include 3 separate audio tracks: 2-ch PCM Stereo, 5.1 Dolby Digital, & 5.1 DTS.  Most ""normal"" people probably don't care about DTS or even know what it is, but many geeks and audiophiles prefer a DTS audio track over DD when available. (note for DTS audio, you need DTS capable equipment)

As for the the performance itself, it's just a great show.  The songs are generally sung in at a faster tempo and with more energy than Dido's studio tracks.  The little narrations Dido provides between sets help explain the songs and provide her fans with some added insight into her personality....  i was kinda surprised to learn she really isn't the ""quiet, stay-at-home"" type I've always pictured her to be.  Instead she sounds kinda wild and I like it :)

I really liked the concert's simple and elegant lighting without the distracting strobes and lasers typical of the industry.  For the most part, Dido is lit with a soft blue or violet spotlight against a dark background that makes her skin luminous.  It's just very pretty and easy on the eyes.  Also the video cuts, pans and zoom are kept to a minimum here thank god.  NO STUPID MTV like editing here where everything is limited to 2 seconds per shot before panning and zooming and swooping and shaking to the next out-of-focus 2-second shot!

I highly recommend this DVD.  Unlike motion picture DVDs which I've stopped purchasing altogether, I'll enjoy this concert again and again.  A must buy for Dido fans.",1202601600,5,3077,4.798479087452471

2257085,5,B00082ZS5W,"If you've read the other reviews, you might recognize the title I chose. ""It'll blow you away."" I stole that from Jonathan Koe's review. Thanks, J.K., please don't sue me...my net worth is about $1.98, and that's only on payday. Also, this DVD is in widescreen (1.78:1, I believe), rather than the 1.33:1 (full screen mode) that this site says it's in. There are no Dvd extras, but you do get a song selection list that lets you jump to any of the 17 songs, instantly.

I listened to this Dvd in Dolby 2.0 channel stereo and it sounded amazing through my 4 speakers. It's also in Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Stereo Surround (which you can select with your Dvd remote).

I enjoyed the brief but clever opening, featuring lighted cars whizzing along night roads, a sunset, and the path taken through part of the Brixton Academy (London) where this was filmed. I also liked Dido's comments about the origins of some of her songs, which she talks about just before she sings them in the concert.

Although, what's very odd, is that the first time I watched this concert, for the first 47 minutes or so, I was NOT blown away at all. In fact, I was quite annoyed. First of all, I wanted to see Dido! Not a Dido bathed in white light, than blue, green, pink, purple, turquoise...I think I imagined some of the colors, but when the stage turned red and two beams of red light from above the stage, focused on Dido, while she sang the words, ""Take Me Home"", during the opening song, ""Stoned""; I was positive aliens were about to beam her to their mother ship. Luckily, this didn't happen, but I was still a bit shaken and was pretty sure I was only going to give this DVD 3 stars.

You could call this concert, ""Dido's Electric Light Orchestra Extravaganza."" It all looked cool enough and was very stylish and clever, but I was waiting for the light show to end, so I could concentrate on the hottie on the stage, rather than all the hot lights.

Secondly, I kept trying to figure out if Dido had a cold or not? One reviewer was so sure she had one, that for the one brief second I thought she sounded a bit congested, I thought she actually might start sneezing.

However, I finally realized that even if she had a cold, I wasn't going to be able to notice, so I just sat patiently, listening to her wonderful, yet perhaps, slightly sick voice (just kidding), as she sang  her heart out. I've seen her on tv and listened to enough of her songs to know that she could sing beautifully, so I still wasn't blown away.

It was all just too much for my little brain to grasp. It was way over my head and too advanced a show for me to fully appreciate upon first viewing. I was expecting something like a ""Natasha Beddingfield: Live in N.Y. City"" concert, mixed with some of the ""Jewel: Live at Humphrey's by the Bay"" concert.

Instead, what I got, was a brilliantly and cleverly filmed light show, that happened to feature a wonderful singer named Dido, and superbly talented musicians, using a wide variety of instruments and strange objects (some most likely never used in a concert before, or certainly not that often), to entertain and dazzle the audience. I thought the glow-in-the-dark, green drumsticks, were a nice touch, but would someone please tell the bass guitar player to never wear a Detroit Piston basketball jersey while on stage. He looked so out of place.

It wasn't until chapter 10 (about 48 minutes into this 90 minute concert) that I got something I was expecting and waiting for. Dido playing her guitar, while singing ""Mary's in India"". No flashy light show, just a girl and her guitar. That was the Jewel part of the show, and a few more like it, were to come later on.

After that, I was hooked. I went back and watched some of the previous songs again (""See You When Your 40"" {my 4th favorite}, ""Isobel"" {3rd favorite}, etc.), and enjoyed them much more. At that moment, I realized that this was a four star Dvd, at least. I then watched ""Mary's in India"" (my 5th favorite) once more, then a nice rendition of ""Take my Hand"" followed it, as well as an infectious version of ""Thank You"" (my 2nd favorite performance on this Dvd). Three more songs were sung, and then came ""All I Want""(my favorite performance) and ""See the Sun"", to end the concert. Dido shouts, ""Thank you London"", and leaves the stage.

No Dido, Thank you!

Throughout the entire concert, the marvellous lighting crew, added so much to virtually every song, but I guess I was just too distracted and overwhelmed by it all at first, to really appreciate what they were doing. I couldn't connect with Dido, because it was hard to see her. Even when she started introducing her songs, she still seemed like a stranger to me. Had they started with ""Mary's in India"", or any song that didn't constantly feature blue or white light always on her face, I would have had a much easier time enjoying everything, right away.

I now enjoy every performance, because the second half of the concert made it easier for me to connect with Dido. For example, the last two songs of the concert, ""All You Want"" and ""See the Sun"", still had plenty of lighting effects, but they were not overwhelming, unlike the ones during ""Stoned"" (it does look cool though, and I now like it). The vocal performances and varied camera angles for the last two songs are good enough on their own, but when the beautiful pink stage lights slowly turn on, during ""All I Want"", I can't help but say, ""Wow"", each and every time I watch it. The green lighting that later bathes the stage during that song, also looks amazing! As well, the golden lighting for ""See the Sun"", is also brilliantly timed and presented in several different ways (such as the perfectly timed golden light flashes, appearing each of the two times Dido strums her guitar, during a close-up).

So, special thanks to the Lighting Crew Chief: Andrew Beller, and the Lighting crew: Edward Jackson and Robert Gawler. Also, to Andi Watson, for his set and lighting design. Sorry I didn't get what you were doing the first time around, but now I know better. Pure genius! Repeat viewing is a must to fully appreciate everything that's packed into this concert! 5 stars!

You were right J.K., I was blown away, after all. Thanks.",1185753600,2,6232,4.526222222222223

2257087,5,B00082ZS5W,"Dido is one of the few singer/song writers that always leaves you wanting more. Her songs are like poetry made especially for you. I have been a fan of hers since I heard Here with Me on Roswell. I wasn't a fan of her music videos and I waited soo long for the 2nd album. I loved it. Every emotion I have ever felt was written into the songs with perfection. I searched for when a third album would be released and I saw that this special edition dvd was coming out. As always I went to Best Buy before they opened to be sure to get a copy.

The dvd showed what a real talent she is. Dressed modestly and ready to share her songs with London she takes the crowd's breath away. One of the best things about this dvd is that she gives a little bit of info on each song. Like for instance Don't Leave Home is not a love ballad. It's a song about addiction. She says that some people play this song at their wedding and she laughs about it. I would too, knowing that. And Mary's in India is about a real friend who traveled. And she experienced some trouble with the release on White Flag because it's about her relationship ending.

Dido's voice is soothing and she just appears to be a real person with real problems and to cope with it all she writes songs and it just so happens that she's good at it. The camera angles are great cause they center on her and it's not a big production- it's like you have the front row to a great concert.

I don't know a single person who says ""I don't like Dido's music"" after they listen to her albums. It's impossible. When someone close to me died I listened to See the Sun over and over. The words made me feel not alone.

The dvd also comes with a live cd. This is great because the live performance of See You When You're 40 is played with a great intensity and it's much better live. This dvd is great and if you love Dido's music you must see her perform. It is a treat. She doesn't do a lot of touring here in the U.S. so this is as good as seeing her in person.",1177200000,,2006,4.058080808080808

i watched several times that first week and found that some of the songs from her cds that i didn't really care for were amazing live.

my [..]daughter loves it, it's a treat for her to be able to watch it. she also listens to the cd EVERYNIGHT when she goes to bed (for over a year now).

I don't want to be at the mercy of a video editor on steroids!  I want to be pulled into the music...pulled into the performance and the performer.  And that's what this video does.

Dido's music is unbelievably good and this DVD not only showcases her amazing stage presence, but offers live versions of her best music that surpass any studio recordings.  We've watched/listened to this concert more than a dozen times over the last year or so -- a definite winner.

Sony, however, displays the evilness of recording labels' ultimate arrogance and disrespect for their customers.  The CD contains protected content which may cause vulnerabilities to your computer.

I mean it's a concert video for goodness sake! A piece of entertainment! Yet, there are some nights, where I just can't sleep. In the dark of the early AM, it seems like the whole world is in bed..sound asleep. On those nights, I'll put this DVD on and it seems to lull me into a twilight trance, all to the magnificent sounds and confessions of singer/songwriter, Dido Armstrong. For anyone who's ever heard Dido's music, you know she is a singer, who gets personal. Dido has a pop/rock sound, augmented with laid back, electonica back-beats. This is all in support of her amazing voice. It's a voice that  seems to just go up and down your spine, causing those little hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Dido's songs are about her life, love and emotional hurt. This is one performer, who is not afraid to open her life up to you and bares herself emotionally naked. (O.K., I'm definitely in blathering idiot mode!) In this concert DVD, she performs live in front of a couple thousand cheering fans at London's Brixton Academy. But even though she's in front of a large crowd, she seems to engage the viewer personally with her friendly, song introductions, her confessional, tell-all song lyrics and a lively musical performance, backed by an excellent group of musicians. Dido is just one of those performers, who really reaches down somewhere in herself and puts it all out there in her performance. The DVD includes many of her hits from the two CDs in her discography, including ""White Flag"", ""Life For Rent"", Don't Leave Home"", ""Sand in My Shoes"" and ""Thank You"". The sound and picture on this DVD is wonderfully remastered. The DVD package also includes a shortened audio CD. But between the two, the DVD is the way to really experience this concert.

Dido Armstrong can not only sing and write her songs, but she can really perform on stage. She is just simply beautiful and her looks, talent writing and singing reminded me of a young Christie McVie, when the later performed as a founding member of Fleetood Mac in the 1970's.

This live DVD performance is sensual, well recorded with excellent camera works, and does the work to capture Dido performing in a very natural and lose setting.

The live versions of her songs are fantastic...not too off from the originals but just spiced up enough to make you love them as new songs.

She is a truly gifted artist and this is a must for any Dido fan.  Her commentary during the concert is great as well...she clues everyone into the real meaning of ""Don't Leave Home"" (a song about addiction, not love) and gives a real sense of how down to earth she is.  She's also quite funny (During the concert at the Chicago Theatre a man in the second row center was watching her through binoculars to which she replied, ""Jesus, I'm not meant to be seen that close!"").

2257109,5,B00082ZS5W,"A smooth and polished performance with perfect lighting effects, absolutely astounding sound and an almost ethereal quality about it, Dido's performance at Brixton Academy is pure magic.  I'll admit that I was skeptical before I actually viewed this concert.  In the past, the only live performances by Dido that I had seen were appearances on talk shows and such, which did not showcase her talent like they should have.  In fact, she often seemed timid and shy.  Despite that, I have always been a devoted fan, even before the days of ""Stan"" and the series Roswell.  Dido is and always has been captivating and real: her music is extremely accessible and emotionally touching.

When the first harsh beats of ""Stoned"" hit my ears, I just knew the whole concert was going to be fantastic.  There was an intense energy in the air at the Academy the night, and you can feel it while watching the video.  The music pulses right through you.  I was ecstatic Dido chose to open her concert with ""Stoned"": what a great piece!  It has always been one of my favorites from her second album, and it perfectly sets the mood for the entire concert within the first 30 seconds.

Many of the songs Dido performs remain similar to the respected album versions (""Don't Leave Home"", ""Sand In My Shoes"") but they don't lack for intensity and enthusiasm.  Each song has its own little new additions, however subtle they may be.  But Dido's revamped versions of favorites like ""See You When You're 40"", ""Honestly Ok"" and ""Do You Have A Little Time"" are what truly impress.  The live versions are better in some ways than the original cuts.  Particularly impressive is Dido's edgier version of ""Isobel"": her vocals sound fantastic!  Also to be commended is her reinterpretation of ""Hunter"", which sounds very jazzy and fun.

The instrumental balance throughout the concert is very well done and executed wonderfully.  Everyone seems to be on the same wavelength.  Several of the musicians shine as soloists, and the drummer in particular is very impressive.  In between tracks, Dido briefly describes the origin of many of her songs, being both blunt and charming at the same time (a quality that seduces many men and intrigues most women).  Also appealing about Dido in this performance is her appearance: she looks as if she's ready for a night of clubbing.  She appears both gorgeous and playful.  There isn't the slightest hint of arrogance in her, and she seems incredibly friendly.

If you thought Dido was quiet, you're wrong: this video proves that, not only does Dido have an edge, but she has a wonderful sense of humor as well.  The audio disc included in this package is a real perk, as it possesses the same intensity the video does, even without the visual stimulation.  However, five of the live tracks are not included on the audio disc, which is a bit of a letdown.  But the audio disc flows smoothly from one song to the next, and it feels complete despite the missing songs.

If you're a diehard Dido fan, you absolutely have to have this video!  If you are a casual fan, or if you haven't yet discovered the hidden pleasures of Dido's musical creations, then I highly recommend you check this out: you may find yourself transformed into a devoted listener.",1125014400,10,3256,4.754010695187166
2257110,5,B00082ZS5W,"If I were to have one complaint about Dido, it would be her studio tracks are a little *too* laid back and they sometimes get monotonous if you're not in the mood for them.  Nevertheless, I love her songwriting and she ranks with up there with Poe as far as lyrical excellence is concerned.  Her lyrics are subtle, sophisticated, and well-crafted.  Here on her live DVD, my one complaint towards her is revoked, removed, and I've re-experienced Dido at her finest.  Her live performance is where the missing spark can be found; her energy comes through blasting and blaring and she takes you for a memorable ride.

As a casual fan, what surprised me was her undeniable charm and charisma.  Along with her energy, these elements of her just don't come through on her studio albums nor in her videos.  She's also got quite a facetious, lively sense of humor (which she shares with the audience between songs).  This makes the music that much more accessible.  I found I didn't need to be 'in the mood' for her music to watch her concert.  Like her music, Dido herself is captivating in a subdued, subtle manner.  The band, the singing were all top-notch and I have no complaints about the music.  Dido, her band, and the audience all looked as if they were having the time of their lives, and it definitely shows.  The music was all terrific, and so good was this concert that it prompted me to re-visit some songs I didn't particularly like and give them a second chance after seeing it live on the DVD.  That's a sure sign a concert was a winner for me.

Fans of Dido will not want to miss banter and conversations that happen in between songs.  She shares (briefly) some information about the song she's going to sing next, which is quite nice.  She never gets too carried away (y'know how some singer-songwriters make less and less sense the more they talk about their song?) and always stays grounded and makes complete sense.  Surprisingly, she's also quite funny!  (And guys, my husband watched this DVD and he assures me she's quite hot, as well.)

Now, on to a very important reason I love this DVD: no. psychotic. editing!  (Yay!  Yay!  Yay!)  After being so very, very, very disappointed with Sheryl Crow's ""C'mon America"" and Sarah McLachlan's ""Afterglow Live,"" I was afraid Dido's DVD was going to follow the 'nauseatingly choppy and twirly rockstar' trend.  (Note: I love those two ladies and I thought their performances were top-notch.  This isn't an attack on Sheryl or Sarah's performances--I just couldn't stand editing of the video) I've said repeatedly on Amazon that I wish that trend would die because I literally get motion sick watching concerts that do their editing that way (where the camera doesn't linger on any one shot for more than 5 seconds) and those DVDs are absolutely unwatchable.  (I'm 24, so no, it's not an age issue.)  So, if you can sympathize with this, fear not!  Dido has not succumbed and this DVD is more than watchable.  The only complaint I can see is that the video quality isn't crystal clear.  It reminded me a bit of Sarah McLachlan's 'Mirrorball.'  I, however, enjoyed the look of it because it lent a certain atmosphere and feel to the DVD that complemented it very well.

Ever since Sarah McLachlan's 'Mirrorball,' I haven't found a concert DVD that's compelled me to watch and re-watch a concert as often as I did with 'Mirrorball.'  Dido's done it for me, though, and it's quite a pleasure to see her perform.  This is one of the concerts that will get watched often in my house.  I will be anxiously awaiting her next CD, DVD, tour, etc.",1124841600,71,3595,4.650793650793651
2257111,5,B00082ZS5W,"Dido sings many of the songs from her first two cd's, See You When You're Forty, Life For Rent, My Life and Thank-you are all done beautifully.  She also talks personally to the audience and you learn a lot about the struggles in her life and why some of the songs were written.  The sound is very clear and the camera angles are great.  If you like Dido then I would advise not passing this up. It's the closest you're going to get to a concert as her website does not currently have any tours scheduled.  Unlike some concert DVD's you can't hear the crowd screaming in the background which often takes away from the enjoyment.  There is also a CD in this set which is from the concert but does not have all the DVD songs due to space issues on the CD, nevertheless it is an enjoyable CD.",1123718400,,789,4.233333333333333
2257112,5,B00082ZS5W,Fabulous live concert with acoustic versions for the favorites songs. Plus the CD remastered. Very recomended,1122940800,,109,5.875
2257113,5,B00082ZS5W,"I have always enjoyed Dido's music and have both her albums. So when the opportunity came to see her live in concert recently I jumped at the chance.  Her first song was Stoned, same as this DVD so I guess I must have seen her late in the same tour, and I can honestly say I have never heard a better bass in all my life.  It simply hammered you where you stood.  So I was very interested to see if the impressive percussions would translate into the DVD.  I can honestly say my 5.1 sound system is the limiting factor in the reproduction, but comes as close as I'm likely to get reproducing the same bass beat, Awesome.  If you want to appreciate this DVD make sure you have a loud high quality system.

I enjoyed most of the songs just as mush as at the concert, although in my concert the bongo playing came during the song Sand in My Shoes, and this extended version was a delight.

The only downside on the music front would be the Audio CD which does not contain the extended versions of the songs during the concert. I'm a big fan of extended versions.  On the flip side,  how good was it to get a CD thrown in for free!  I paid more for my CD Life for Rent when it came out than I did for this DVD.

You'll have to make up your own mind if you like Dido in concert between songs,  she doesn't talk much, doesn't interact with the audience and doesn't appear to have much to say.  But I loved it live and I'm a bigger fan for seeing this DVD. The shy British reserved manner works for me and I'll be queuing to see her again live if ever the opportunity arises.",1121990400,,1568,4.084967320261438
8055441,5,B00082ZS5W,"I've this DVD for over 19 years now and have watched it numerous times on my home theater system. It really sounds great and watching her perform is a treat. The only thing that could make this better is if the video was in high definition. My home theater consists of a 96"" diagonal screen with a BenQ front projector and Definitive Technology powered towers, a center, surrounds, and a powered sub. The image is decent, but I've been spoiled by high definition and think this would make this concert so much more enjoyable.",1526342400,,525,4.595744680851064

BTW, this is my reference DVD for auditioning speakers. It has everything from voice, Dido's beautiful voice, lots of percussion and other unusual instruments, synthesizer, trance, a kind of raw production that good speakers should expose. I think this set is actually out-of-print. I didn't buy it new because I have a funny feeling that the South America vendor of ""brand-new copies"" is rolling them himself.",1466121600,,585,4.801980198019802
