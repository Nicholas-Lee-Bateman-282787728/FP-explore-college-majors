4639772,3,B005A5WNZA,The story is good but the acting leaves something to be desired. My sports minded young adults enjoyed it but felt the same about the acting.,1363996800,,141,4.461538461538462
4639773,3,B005A5WNZA,"IT was a great storyline, but I found that the acting was not the best. IT was cool to see the story of the prodigal son in a new light.",1362873600,,136,3.566666666666667
4639774,4,B005A5WNZA,The theme is like the prodigal son.  This movie portrays in a real life situation hhow God always is willing to take us back.  a story of redemption.,1361404800,,149,4.285714285714286
4639775,4,B005A5WNZA,"a good movie overall, even though it has a slow start. picks up shortly and is an encouraging and uplifting storyline.",1360108800,,118,4.666666666666667
4639776,1,B005A5WNZA,"The time and money spent seeking wholesome entertainment was not well rewarded with this purchase.  BREAKING THE PRESS was filled with immodesty including the ""mother""/""wife"" of the main characters and too little foundational substance. Breaking the Press is NOT A SAFE MOVIE and certainly DOES NOT exemplify the christian values I hope to be modeled for my family!",1354924800,5,365,5.293103448275862
4639777,2,B005A5WNZA,"I gave this movie 2 stars because I bought it mainly so my boys (ages 8,7,&,4) would have a good basketball movie to watch.  The cover says ""if you like Facing the Giants then you will love Breaking the Press"", NOT TRUE, by the end of the movie, (which we reached rather quickly with fast-forwarding parts), my whole family decided it was a waste of time.  The parts we fast-forwarded were parts where there were girls that were hardly dressed in bikinis,  Josh & his girlfriend were heavily making out, these are things I don't care to see in a ""Christian"" movie and I certainly don't want my boys to see. Although the story line is good the moral rating is NOT. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",1353456000,7,706,4.457364341085271
4639778,5,B005A5WNZA,"Breaking the Press is an excellent modern retelling of the Prodigal Son parable Jesus told in the Bible.  This time, it's with sports instead of money, but the story is still there.  It's a good way to tell the story, and the movie is very much worth watching.  Sports fans love this film, and I think coaches will too.",1321315200,7,319,4.372881355932203
4639779,5,B005A5WNZA,"The dvd Breaking The Press had a huge message that many I believe can relate with regarding bad choices.  We all have make a back choice or thought we were all ""That"". This dvd gives you a clear view of how to make a change to your choices, or maybe you have cut someone out of your life without much thought.  A nice bit of informative information.  Enjoy!!!",1318896000,3,359,4.25
4639780,5,B005A5WNZA,"This is a good Christian film and for it to be based on true real life drama and decisions is just amazing. I laughed and cried but mostly, cried. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!",1318204800,2,167,4.090909090909091
4639781,2,B005A5WNZA,"""It's a blessing, God want's this.""  A high school basketball coach (Waters) on the hot seat tries to get his son to be a team player.  When he thinks he is better then the small town team he leaves to play in the big city.  When life comes at him he must make a choice.  I will begin by saying, not to start an argument, my biggest problem with the christian movie genre is that nothing ever seems to go wrong.  While this movie had much more problems happening to the main characters then usual this is still unrealistic and very predictable.  This is much better then the last few christian movies that I have seen but I haven't seen the ""Grace Card"" yet.  While this did have more obstacles to over come then ""Facing The Giants"" I would compare this to that movie.  Overall, not a bad movie, horrible acting.  I have seen worse though. I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - No I won't.

*Also try - 5th Quarter & Facing The Giants",1316217600,2,935,4.196629213483146

4639826,1,B005A5WNZA,"This movie was EXTREMELY disappointing!! It is disguised as a ""faith-based"" movie (comparable to ""Facing the Giants??!!!--not even close!!!), but does not exemplify the Christian values of modesty and virtue we uphold in our home (at least it didn't seem to--we turned it off about halfway through). I was very uncomfortable watching this film with my husband--thankfully, we did NOT include our kids to watch it for the first time--as there were young girls who were hardly dressed in the film. We often choose faith-based films in our home to avoid the overt sexuality that is prevalent in most Hollywood films today and were so saddened to see that even this film included such unnecessary scenes. We threw it away! Don't waste your time or money if you're looking for substance!!!",1406160000,,784,4.99236641221374
4639827,5,B005A5WNZA,"Awesome!
We were very glad to receive this movie.  It worked perfectly.

4639828,1,B005A5WNZA,"My son picked this movie because he's interested in basketball, and breaking through a full court press, this movie had very little to learn about basketball.  It's an all glory to God Christian story about the prodigal son, very weak story line about 2 brothers, very strange and not very believable dramatizations about teens and family dynamics, and low budget filming.  Not  sure why it was important to the director to have them be adopted, I felt like it was because that was a way to release responsibility from the Christian parents for their son going awry - running away, eating out of the trash, and then coming home to suit up same day and make game winning 3 point shot.  Christian rocking Great Aunt, father crying and giving all glory to God for son's return, no personal responsibility at all  - just believe in God and you're in.  Should put ""a Christian film"" on cover",1388448000,,886,4.647435897435898
4639829,3,B005A5WNZA,Good story line and  these actors are at least as good as the Hollywood bunch whose only talent is taking their clothes off in front of a camera.  I don't regret purchasing it because it supports those trying to upgrade the industry standards so we can all enjoy the movies again.,1379894400,3,280,4.470588235294118
4639830,5,B005A5WNZA,I rated this high because it shows how god has mercy on people. I would recommend this to any who is going through a struggle,1367193600,3,125,4.04

8463218,5,B005A5WNZA,It met with our expectations --- very entertaining and good story line that totally fits with The prodigall son in the Bible.  Has a wonderful and challenging message on love and forgiveness and redemption.,1508716800,,206,5.0588235294117645

8463221,1,B005A5WNZA,"Breaking the Press had a lot of potential, but turned out to be a great disappointment. Many elements of the story line seemed convoluted and contrived. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case favorably compares this movie to Facing The Giants, but it doesn't even come close. Don't waste your money.",1441065600,,301,4.69811320754717
