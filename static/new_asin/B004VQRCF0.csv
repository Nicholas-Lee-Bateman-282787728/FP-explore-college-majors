4483777,3,B004VQRCF0,"It's yes, so it can't be bad.  But having the great Steve Howe being forced to share the stage with 80s douchebag Trevor Rabin is kind of a drag.  Don't get me wrong, Trevor is very talented, but he just gets in Steve's way.  Also it's a shame the Bill Bruford has to play down to Alan White's level.  No offense to Alan, but Bill is a God.  3 stars.",1457136000,2,350,3.942857142857143
4483778,5,B004VQRCF0,"A most important moment in the history of Yes.  This was their Woodstock.  On the last night of a tour that would be the last time these 8 men played together.  Bill Bruford would never again play with Yes.  They played great, they had a youthful verve that would soon be gone from their aging bodies.  It was wonderful to see them have so much fun.  At one point we were treated to a parade of roadies across the stage wearing Budweiser boxes on their heads.  All the antics of the closing night of a tour were on full display.  It was beautiful, a pleasure to behold.  And Jon sang the heck out of everything.  Chris played his 3-necked bass on Awaken.  I'm so glad I have this footage, and any Yes fan will be too.",1456012800,5,717,4.198529411764706

4483781,3,B004VQRCF0,"Not the union tour in the round stage!!!-just a concert, with former  and current members. Compared to the YES rockumentary, this concert was ok, non inspiring drum sounds(or sometimes non-audible.)
Bruford appears bored, and lip/drum syncing most of the time, when he actually has mad percussive skills. If Steve Howe smiles(other than at an Asia concert) it would be a photogenic moment!
Songs and sounds were ok, no diss there.
Have all the YES albums, this was not what I hoped would be a great concert-not even filmed on the round stage like in Pennsacola Florida!!
the band, and Jon Anderson alludes that this is their last stop on the current tour-and they seem tired to me.
Shame, one of the most prolific prog rock bands ever.
A notch below live in montreax,In my opinion.
Will try Tsonga next, hoping for a capture of an inspiring performance, instead of a band -appearing to go through the motions.",1449446400,,909,4.789808917197452

4483786,2,B004VQRCF0,"YES is one of the great bands, and I admire the musical skills and showmanship they bring to this concert. Thus the Union Concert would probably deserve 4 stars. However, my main issues with this concert are a) the sound quality, especially the vocals which are almost impossible to hear (and maybe Jon Anderson's voice was worn out at the end of the tour) and b) the set list. This concert has nothing to do with the album ""Union"" and features mostly songs from the earlier years. Taste is individual, I know - I like their style/ the songs of the albums 90125, Big Generator, Anderson Bruford Wakeman & Howe, or Union. Thus the concert was absolutely not for me. I did enjoy seeing the great bass player Chris Squire in action! Very sad to see him pass away recently.",1435622400,,769,4.5

4483793,5,B004VQRCF0,"I saw this tour in Miami in the round and remember it being awesome! Now here's the proof. Union was an odd album, but enjoyable non-the less. It was a mixture of classic and 90125 Yes. On this tour they had both bands together on stage playing a mixture of songs from both iterations and seemingly having a blast while doing it. Great to see two great guitarist working together and also being highlighted separately. Their styles are different and it just adds to the overall uniqueness of this project. Rabin is also a great vocalist on his own, so the background vocals sound full and rich. Wakeman and Kaye blend perfectly together. I was surprised how well Bruford and White meshed, creating a super drummer. The overall enegry of this show is superb. And of course, Jon Anderson delivers another amazing performance. Picture and sound quality are very good, considering when it was filmed. I was very pleased by the audio in particular, which seemed to improve as the show progressed. One reviewer had commented that there was too much talent on stage at the same time. I couldn't disagree more. They were playing as one band, perfectly meshed and complimenting each other, while still show casing each individuals talent and virtuosity. I am a consumate Yes fan and enjoyed both versions of the band. This tour was a treat. If you are a Yes fan, buy it! It's cheap and it's awesome. Rocket!!",1409875200,8,1399,4.714285714285714
4483794,5,B004VQRCF0,great concert dvd of the YES reunion tour of 1991. All of the original members of the different reincarnations of Yes got together for this one(minus Peter Banks and the buggles )  this was the show I saw in Cincinnati and it was truly amazing! The DVD is the last show of that tour. Sound could have been much better but I digress. Very enjoyable YES concert!!,1408060800,5,361,4.388059701492537
4483795,2,B004VQRCF0,They are all great musicians but there is just too much talent playing on stage at the same time. Very peculiar tour. I give it 2 1/2 stars.,1404777600,,140,4.035714285714286

4483797,5,B004VQRCF0,This is the full 2 hour version. In 1991 Yes took on a huge band with several ex-members joining up to form a super Yes group. In my opinion it mostly works. There are several featured solo spots for each member and they are all brilliant. This is a different Yes concert from all the many available and very enjoyable. I highly recommend if you can find the full version on the Gonzo label. Its the best sounding and best image available.,1402358400,2,439,4.365853658536586
4483798,4,B004VQRCF0,"I'm not the Yes completest I used to be, so the 2011 release of this DVD missed me for some reason. I saw this tour in Montreal and Lake Placid, so I had some expectations. Boy, was I surprised. So glad I bought it.

First off, the two shows I saw of this tour, the band was amazing, but Jon was having a very difficult time. He was having a hard time staying on pitch, he looked bloated and tired. But, in this show, he is spot on, thinner, energized, and running around stage like ABWH Tour!

Which is an interesting comparison, because this show was filmed in the same venue as the excellent ABWH video: An Evening Of Yes Music Plus. I'm sure that fact was not lost on the lads....

As mentioned, this is not the complete show from that night. (http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/yes/1991/shoreline-amphitheatre-mountain-view-ca-13d21511.html for complete setlist). Missing are ""Shock To The System,"" ""And You And I,"" ""Drum Duet,"" ""Changes,"" and ""Lift Me Up."" Also, there is no ""In The Round"" stage....

However, the show has the feel of a complete show, and the performance is fantastic.

Rabin, in particular, shines here. The man is so amazing. And he and Wakeman are just having a blast. Actually, everyone is having a blast, even Howe, who put on a bit of a pouty face at the beginning of the tour. He and Rabin have some great moments together. Wakeman's Keytar solo in the audience is a riot. White and Squire are just amazing together, and even the road crew makes an appearance during ""Saving My Heart.""

""Awaken"" is probably the best performance I have ever heard, especially the second part (organ/harp section). It's breathtaking.

A great video for all you Yes-heads out there. It's so different from many other performances.... You'll be smiling all the way through.",1382659200,4,1778,4.790849673202614

4483806,5,B004VQRCF0,I never saw Yes with Trevor Rabin live so this was an amazing video from my perspective. I regret never having seen the 8 man lineup when it came through town years ago. It was worth the money as I'm a die hard fan since 1971.,1349136000,3,226,3.9347826086956523
4483807,5,B004VQRCF0,"Okay, I'm biased. My new wife and I (we'd been married less than 9 months) had just seen Yes at the Oakland Coliseum (""in the round"") several months before, and were back in Mountain View at the Shoreline Amphiteater for this show. I'd been a prog-head my whole life, but my bride was a recent initiate, having been introduced to Yes music via a ABWH show in Seattle a year or two earlier. At the time, the excitement generated by having past and present members of Yes on the same stage playing the canon's ""greatest hits"" was palpable and simply cannot be overstated. It started a tradition of our seeing Yes at nearly every opportunity when their tours brought them through the Pacific Northwest. This show remains a high point in our memory.
That being said, as a document, the DVD gives us all we need. Yeah, yeah, I know, the show is cut, but the material that was cut was stuff from the ""Union"" album and Jon's solo performance. We didn't go to the show to hear that stuff, anyway.
Here's hoping that there's a DVD out there of similar quality that documents the one of the shows from the ""Talk"" tour in 1994.",1339977600,,1116,4.4487804878048784
4483808,5,B004VQRCF0,"I have pretty much everything these guys ever did, and as far as the video performances go, this one is by far my favorite.  Absolutely captures everything I remember about seeing the show twenty-plus years ago:  Eight of the finest musicians in the genre, beating the suits and the lawyers controlling the business end of the music scene, cruising on auto pilot, and seemingly enjoying every minute of their last performance together.  I absolutely love this DVD.",1338336000,6,464,5.0
4483809,5,B004VQRCF0,"A Yes fans delight for sure. This is the last tour Yes did in large venues.

Not for the first time listener, this show was for the real fans.

8 of the most talented Rock musicians to ever form a single band (if for only one tour).

Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, and Howe meet the 90125 guys for a great tour. I saw 3 shows of this tour in 1991 and this DVD is a treasure for me. If you remember this tour you will love this DVD.",1325808000,,428,3.896551724137931

4483812,5,B004VQRCF0,"I BOUGHT THE 2CD,2DVD BOX SET FROM GONZOMULTIMEDIA. IN AMERICAN CURRENCY IT COST ABOUT $55.00. YOU GET THE CALIFORNIA CONCERT THAT'S ADVERTISED HERE WHICH WAS EDITED DOWN TO 2 HOURS. PLUS YOU GET 2 FULL LENGTH 3 HOUR BOOTLEG CONCERTS,ONE IN FLORIDA AND ONE FROM DENVER. THE ONE FROM DENVER IS WORTH THE MONEY ALONE,IT'S FILMED IN THE ROUND THE WAY I SAW THEM IN CHICAGO AND IT'S REALLY GOOD QUALITY. THE ONE FROM FLORIDA HAS 2 SONGS THAT WEREN'T PLAYED AT THE OTHER 2 CONCERTS, ""SOON"" AND ""STARSHIP TROOPER"". THE BIG DOWNFALL OF THE FLORIDA CONCERT IS THE PEOPLE THAT WERE FILMING FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES WERE CONSTANTLY SHAKING AND GOING IN AND OUT OF FOCUS, SO BASICALLY IT LOOKS LIKE THE CONCERT WAS FILMED DURING A 3 HOUR EARTHQUAKE. STILL THE MUSIC'S GREAT AND IT'S ROCK HISTORY. AND IF 3 CONCERTS WEREN'T ENOUGH YOU ALSO GET 2 CD'S OF THE AUDIO FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONCERT. A MUST FOR ANY DIE HARD YES FAN. BEWARE THAT THE ONE YOU MIGHT BUY FROM ONE OF THE SELLERS MOST LIKELY WILL BE THE SINGLE DISC. SO WHY PAY $45.00 FOR ONE DISC IF YOU CAN GET THE BOX SET FROM GONZO FOR ABOUT $10.00 MORE.

4483813,5,B004VQRCF0,"This is an excellent show, the band is all smiles and having a great time for the finale of the Union tour back in August of 1991 shot in the Bay Area of California. I had the pleasure of seeing this show ""LIVE"" in Miami a month earlier in July where Yes performed in the round on a revolving stage. This was YES to the MAX, with 2 drummers(White and Bruford), 2 keyboardists (Wakeman and Kaye), 2 guitarists (Howe and Rabin) with founders Chris Squire on Bass and Jon Anderson on Vocals.

The setlist is very good considering this is not a complete show. There was a Special Edition double DVD/CD edition available from Gonzo Multi Media. Much to my chagrin, it was only being offered through the Gonzo Website. The makers of this DVD have cut JA's solo 'Soon',as well as the songs 'Shock to the System' and 'Lift me up' and others from the final edit probably due to time constraints. This is
really the only disappointing thing I can say about this DVD. You still get almost 2 hours in (1:58 to be exact)length and the show still comes off as a full show. To bad, I miss the content which was cut. Problem solved! I took the initative to visit the Gonzo Multi media Website and decided to purchase the Deluxe 2 CD and 2 DVD Package from Gonzo for $39.95. The 2nd DVD in the Gonzo Deluxe package has two full length 'bootleg' shows with all the tracks and more which didn't make the final cut of the 1st DVD. The quality of the 'bootleg'shows in the 2nd
DVD is so so with inconsistent audio and video which is barely acceptable. Nevertheless, you still get two full length concerts. The Denver and Pensacola concerts are in the round, with all the songs which were excluded in the first DVD. The Denver show is very professionally filmed but has drawbacks with clarity of the video and low hum in the audio background which is kind of annoying after watching for a while. Still, it is rare footage! The 2nd DVD concerts include the Bruford /White drum duet which is awesome. I'm glad I have this limited edition, very rare collection which is out of print now. I won't be selling mine on eBay anytime soon.

There are many great individual solo performances which make this a wonderful show. Squire, Howe, Rabin and Wakeman in particular all put on stellar performances. This is a great DVD if you want to look back 20 years from now. The sound and video quality are excellent considering this has been copied from a previous Japenese import version.

Sad to say with the recent passing of Chris Squire there will never be a Yes re-union. I will always be thankful I was able to see Chris Squire
so many times over the last 45 years.",1311033600,35,2635,4.440082644628099
