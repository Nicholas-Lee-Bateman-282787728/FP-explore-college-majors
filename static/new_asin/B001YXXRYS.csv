Depeche Mode moved from Basildon boys to Stadium status and this dramatic elevation is the source of study in The Dark Progression DVD. This 97 minute document charts the remarkable rise of seemingly just another electro outfit to global warriors.
The early days had this pop product knocking out catchy radio fare that certainly caught the imagination of both young girls and the hit parade. However, those Vince Clarke led days were to take a major shift in emphasis as the mood was to get darker, deeper and denser in both its texture and outlook. Clare departed and then later down the road Alan Wilder moved on-but, this did not deter Depeche Mode from more adventure and ultimately enhanced commercial and critical acclaim.
Those cute chart singles were dispensed with and a mix of gothic and industrial overtones to an electronic sourced recipe led to both a fresh and enhanced fan base. There can be no arguments that this career path has proven to be a wise and winning route that has scored over 100 million sales and shows in front of audiences in excess of 80,000.
Peers of the profiled turn offer their opinions; and, it turn Gary Numan, Thomas Dolby plus Andy McCluskey (OMD) provide pertinent data. Record boss Daniel Miller and the producer Gareth Jones are also involved in amongst others who have had hands on experience of working with the Essex entrepreneurs.
Analysis from experts, a range of footage plus miscellaneous additions add to a pertinent package that makes for a wonderful watch just as a fan of music but as a follower of Dave Gahan and company what you have is an essential addition to your collection.

If you're a die-hard fan you'll find this not so exciting and refreshing; but -on the contrary- if you're a newie, this will put you on the right track to know the geniuses behind the extra-awesome music you hear all time and that made you crave for more! ;-)",1333756800,,287,4.333333333333333

Got blown away.... If you like DM or music at all this is one to watch. Don't doubt about it.",1296691200,8,162,3.764705882352941
