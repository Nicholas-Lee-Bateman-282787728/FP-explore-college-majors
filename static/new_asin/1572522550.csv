190771,1,1572522550,"I have always been a fan of Emanuelle films and i would say that the Italian versions are much better, although this is the orginal. Black Emanuelle, Emanuelle around the World and Emanuelle in America are by far  the best titles in the Emanuelle series. If you are looking for Emanuelle  movies then i suggest you look for Laura Gemser, and not Sylvia Krystal.  Believe me this one is not worth it.",958348800,10,399,4.513888888888889
190772,3,1572522550,"I have seen better versions of Emmanuellemovies, but i think this one is ok. If you haven't seen anyone of the other, don't start with this one.",953856000,2,144,4.37037037037037
190773,5,1572522550,"It is amazing that over a quarter of a century since its original release that Emmanuelle remains in the top three best selling French films on video. But is it so remarkable? Here we have a piece of pure eroticism  which has scarcely been matched in all those years. Emmanuelle is not about  explicit sexual action - those that buy it will be disappointed if that is  what they expect, with the exception of the notorious nightclub smoking  scene which I feel sure director Just Jaeckin must now regret including. If  it is possible to feel outraged by anything when watching a movie about  sex, then this scene provokes that reaction. No, this is a mainstream movie  which has the power to move both men and women viewers - not least because  of a towering central performance by the gloriously sexy Ms Kristel. She is  never self-conscious about her body nor at the same time ever flaunts it.  Her nudity is completely natural and her joy in her exploration of her  sexuality totally convincing.
This is because Kristel - and a  high-profile supporting cast - are all extremely capable actors, and are  very well directed by Jaeckin. I guess one should not take the overall  premise of totally liberated sexual experimentation too seriously, but you  completely believe in the characters and want them to come out of the other  side unscathed. I first saw this movie as an 18-year-old on its original  release, saw it again with its original French dialogue in Paris several  years later and have watched it countless times on video and TV since. Yet  it still retains the same erotic charge as it did all those years ago. How  Kristel managed to completely fail to live up to it in her subsequent films  is completely beyond me. The rest of her Emmanuelle series are unsexy and  even seedy by comparison and her ventures into American films offered her  nothing of any substance. I believe Hollywood missed a glorious opportunity  to create an top international star.",947635200,265,1971,4.7463126843657815
190774,5,1572522550,"What stands out first and foremost in this '70s sexsploitation flick is the natural beauty of all the female leads, particularly Sylvia Krystal.  Although hardcore porn fans may not find the scenes revealing enough, I  feel there is a lot to be said about leaving something to the imagination.  I would recommend skipping through the rape scenes which seem oddly out of  place. This movie can by no means be taken seriously, but  if you enjoy unaugmented women who are relatively competent actresses,  you'll love the sexual aristeia of Emmanuelle.",921715200,60,548,5.033333333333333
190775,3,1572522550,"Firstly, this is a Desert Island film.  Emmanuelle actresses are not those popularly known for granted.  The story starts with a death.

For some the plot is slow (remember this is not an American film) but I like as it is. There is no high action or mysteries it's about a girl exploring sex outside of marriage with her husband's consent.  The majority of the story takes place in Thailand.

190799,3,1572522550,"The 2015 Lionsgate reissue of EMMANUELLE is very different to the old 2003 Anchor bay dvd
both dvd versions have the same 94min Unrated cut which had a Graphic rape scene of Emmanuelle
and some other explicit sex scenes that were cut from the original Theatrical release
but the extras are very Different
the 2003 Anchor bay Emmanuelle collection dvd which is tragically out of print now
had the 3 Emmanuelle films over 3 Discs inside foldout Digi-pak
all 3 films are Unrated and they're Definitely uncut
1st is 1:78:1 ratio with English 2.0 Dolby digital stereo with a 17mins retrospective featurette Joys of Emmanuelle
which has new 2002 interviews with Sylvia kristel, Director Just Jaekin & producer Yves roussard
the prodcuers interview is French with English subtitles, Sylvia's & Just interviews are English
Sylvia kristel speaks excellent English for foreign actress
the 2nd Disc is Emmanuelle 2 in much wider ratio 2:35:1 ratio with again English 2.0 Dolby digital
the picture quality looks excellent Anchor bay made the effort with both 1 & 2 Emmanuelles
there's another 10min retrospective interview on the making of the sequel
with the same interviews as the first featurette, it's a continuation of the previous 17mins featurette
and the 3rd Disc which has  Goodbye emmanuelle in the same 2:35:1 ratio & the same English stereo mix
the 3rd making of featurette is the last 9mins with Sylvia kristel & the french Director & producer of the previous 2 films
if played together, it's a long 27min interview with all 3 contributors talking about their experiences making Emmanuelle 1,2,3
but for some stupid reason Anchor bay decided to edit the interviews into 3 seperate featurettes
i think it would've been much better to have the whole 27min interviews together on Disc 1
cause for the first 15mins all 3 of them are talking about the first Emmanuelle film anyway.

the extras on the Lionsgate dvd is EROTIC SUCCESS- MAKING OF EMMANUELLE
which is 50min French TV broadcast in French with English subtitles
you get interviews with the writer, producer, Director of Emmanuelle, plus French film Historians
no interview with Sylvia kristel, no interviews with any of the actors from the film
there's another extra SOFT SELL EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA
which is U.S. retrospective featurette on the original Emmanuelle film- 25mins
the Anchor bay dvd is worth getting more because the 3 featurettes on each 3 Discs
are interviews with Sylvia kristel, Director Just Jaekin & the Producer Yves roussard
tragically Sylvia kristel died of Lung & throat cancer at age 60 few years ago
apparently she was a chain smoker thru her whole career so she was about 50 year old when she did the Anchor bay interview
but it's your Decision, amazon.com does not have the anchor bay dvd listed anymore it's long out of print
so your better off looking for a used copy on ebay.com
5 stars for the Anchor bay dvd, maybe 3 stars for the Lionsgate dvd the extras are the only highlights on the Lionsgate dvd",1465257600,10,2990,4.895463510848126

It actually stands the test of time well and unlike a lot of soft-core films from that era has a lot going for it.

Beautifully directed by Just Jaeckin, the cinematography is quite breathtaking, as if each frame had been shot by an accomplished glamour photographer of the era.

190859,4,1572522550,"Emmanuel is not Deep Throat nor can it be compared to The Unbearable Lightness of Being.  It is an entertaining and a provocative journey,glimpsing into fantasy""s we've all indulged in,even today with nothing left to the imagination,Emmanuel lends romance to sexual pleasures that most call off limits. We're not uncomfortable watching this almost childlike woman ready herself to step beyond her comfort zone and allow her vulnerability to assaulted. Games on and her sexuality is ripe for the picking,to be enjoyed by the more sophisticated array of men and woman who live in the erotically charged ""Town and Country-like""backdrop of Shanghai and Bangkok.
...No one could have captured this more stunningly than Sylvia Kristel,albeit somewhat passive in her ingenue role as she samples each new delight,she is still genuinely believable.
It's a pleasure to watch her move with a natural grace unaware of her desirable body.and the seductive effect it generates..Hardly more voluptuous than a woodland nymph, Kristel's fresh scrubbed, dewy pout entices almost anyone who's caught her scent...Like a student a student trying to learn graduate courses,Emmanuel seems slightly puzzled as to whether she's absorbed  the content of what she's been taught.
 I too saw the original movie with more explicate sex scenes that added an edgier slightly raunchier feel but this is still delicious to watch,the simple storyline is carried visually like a series of dreamy photographs accompanied by an excellent musical score.
It's just pure entertainment to roll in erotic fantasy,lovely to look at,satisfying both the artistic eye and a desire to tap into our own passionate nature.",1415404800,3,1672,5.398467432950191

190897,4,1572522550,"Emmanuelle Bowling for Movies Score: 221.063 of 300

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Emmanuelle - we own the unrated DVD version - Hey now, I should mention this movie is absolutely FAO (For Adults Only) and doesn't belong on the living-room shelf!

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
Shy and sexually ignorant Emmanuelle, wife of a French diplomat, leaves her Paris apartment to join husband Jean in Bangkok.  Upon her arrival Emmanuelle is at first frightened and later seduced by the dark and seedy nature of her fellow French wives and so begins Emmanuelle's ""education"" in all things erotic.  No stone is left unturned in this breakout erotic blockbuster.

Emmanuelle, originally released in France during a period of new found cinematic freedoms, surprised movie executives when it apparently bridged the gap between red light district pornography and average adult movie goers and started bringing in big money.  Further, the French audiences were made up largely of women, which prompted Paramount pictures to release this film in the U.S.  Costing an estimated $500k to make, the world wide box office take exceeds $100m.  When viewed with an open mind it's not hard to see why.  The movie is visually stunning, both exotic and erotic.  The music is pleasant and in step with music for the time.  Emmanuelle is pretty but not beautiful in a very approachable `girl next door' way - and very reminiscent (to me) of a 1920's era flapper.  I think the real kicker to this adult romp is the way in which their eroticism is portrayed - where more hardcore movies focus purely on the act itself, this film focuses mainly on the breaking down of Emmanuelle's walls, the corruption of her morals, and the liberation of her mind (and body).

Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1377734400,3,2944,4.541666666666667

The male characters, especially, are one-dimensional and a little weird. Although we enjoyed seeing Emmanuelle again, the movie was not a turn-on.

190925,3,1572522550,"This film must be in your collection if you are interested in the ART of erotic cinema. This art is, as far as I can see, practically non-existent, (except in brief images), or at least examples of it are very hard to find, and I would welcome any help I can get in expanding my knowledge.
So unfortunately I'm not referring to the film as a whole but only the single scene and its short coda which occurs near the beginning of the film when Emmanuelle couples with two strangers, one after the other, while on a plane on her way to her husband in Bankok. It is really the first of these couplings which is interesting but the other one supplies a fitting supplement rounding it off like a piece of music.
Both scenes are done to perfection. The lighting and sound of the plane engines create a perfect realistic atmosphere and the acting is very convincing. Despite it's context in a commercial soft-porn film this scene has all the qualities of an arthouse film and stays in the mind when almost everything else about the film is forgotten.
The action takes place in the passenger seats while the other people on the plane are sleeping, except for the second man who is watching from a seat further back. The secretiveness and furtiveness of what they are doing is an essential part of it's eroticism
There is partial nudity only but the concealment only makes the erotic charge greater while the participants realistically grapple with the tricky logistics of this sort of encounter. It's also rare for the 'vocal' soundtrack to be this convincing in scenes of this sort but it's of equal importance in creating the effect of realism. Even the sound of the engines is an important ingredient; it's like hearing the nervous system itself as it goes into full sexual arousal and response.
Sound and picture in this scene are all of a piece. This is one for connoisseurs and not to be missed. It has all the flavour and squelch of real sex and if this isn't a fine example of Realism in art I don't know what is. And it's much sexier than any porn if you have normal healthy instincts. If you don't find it very erotic I'll hazard a guess that you're looking for something much more perverse than a taste for lovely thighs set off with stockings and suspenders, and small perfectly formed breasts. Don't say I didn't give you all the facts.

Many who were not of age in the first part of the seventies have never seen this film and have a tendency to judge it inadvertantly by the standards of the later films in the series which they may have seen. But there was nothing to be found of anywhere near comparable value in the later films and even number 5 which was directed by Walerian Borowczyk is abysmally bad. The best things I could find in any of the other films were in no. 2 where there are some good erotic images of Emmanuelle as she sits on a bed, topless and in her underwear. The art-direction of this scene was very good and some people may remember that stills taken on set were used in publicity for the film at the time. Otherwise the most erotic thing in no. 2 is a long held shot of the gusset of E's knickers as another girl's fingers move around inside. Actually I'm not dismissing this, it is quite erotic and it is interesting from a 'theoretical' point of view, if you see what I mean, but it's no marvel of erotic filmmaking.
There are also some well known photo-style images of E. undergoing acupuncture but they are a bit too self-conscously like advertising art-direction for my liking.
But getting back to Emmanuelle 1, if you want to watch the rest of the film make sure to watch it in French as that way it is quite bearable. There is a disturbing sequence later in the film at a Tai boxing match, where Emmanuelle is provided to service the victor, which is perhaps essential, for your education, to see, but it isn't pleasant.

Check out my reviews of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' and 'Story Of Sin' for similarly interesting scenes.",1348272000,2,3970,4.497229916897507

190927,5,1572522550,"This movie was the first erotic movie that I saw, many years ago and I can safely say that none has met my expectations since.  This movie is one of very few erotic movies that alludes to extreme sexuality and sensuality without the explicitness of porn movies.  It has aged very, very well.

The main character is well portrayed by the beautiful Silvia Kristel.  She is both weak and strong as a person and as a sexual being.  I felt that she very well portrayed the uncertainty that accompanies the joy and mystique of sexual freedom.  This movie is about sexual freedom but presented in a manner that I find hard to describe.  It is presented in a romantic and idealised way; subtle in parts, explicit (comparatively) in others.

I give this movie 5 stars as I think it's exceptional for the erotic genre that it fits into but also because it is a well articulated and presented story.",1343520000,2,888,4.540880503144654
190928,4,1572522550,"A flawed erotic masterpiece; ""Emmanuelle"" (with two ""m's"") set the standard for a new kind of lushly exotic soft-core with high production values. Its influence is unmistakable in the work of Zalman King (""Wild Orchid"") and Rafael Eiseman (""Lake Consequence"") to name but two of its most famous mainstream imitators. The settings are exhileratingly sensuous and richly captured by the superb cinematography. The sex, for the most part, is low-key, more tittilating than graphic, and very obviously simulated. In fact, it's pretty tame stuff by today's standards. The late Gene Siskil named this as one of his ""guilty pleasures"" citing the film's tasteful lack of emphasis on ""plumbing,"" and I very much agree with that assessment. HOWEVER; the narrative (such as it is) is marred by two gratuitous rape scenes which make no thematic sense whatsoever and spoil the gorgeously established mood of warm, pastel eroticism. No; rape is not sexy; it's not even about sex. Degradation is not erotic, and violence against woman is not a turn-on for healthy well-adjusted human beings. Skip past those two scenes, though, and there's much to admire and enjoy in ""Emmanuelle.""

The early, almost chaotic scenes of her arrival in Bangkok give way to their first love-making. She is later introduced to a group of bored housewives languishing by a pool. All are physically attractive, slim and pert. There is considerable topless sunbathing and some nude swimming. Lesbian love-making features; something Emmanuelle never realised was in her. The radical side of this tale is the husband's declaration ""she is not my special possession; she can do what she wants with whomever..."". Later, ""you are not my possession, you are not my beauty, you ARE beauty!"". That is put to the test when she disappears for a few days and he reacts. Later again, hubby introduces her to Mario; a venerable student of the erotic, who then seeks to liberate her from convention in these matters. There is no masochism, sadism or other aspects of a dark side. This is a self-confessed pursuit of pleasure. It broke new ground when first released in the 1970s.

So this is where it all began: Just Jaeckin's film of Jean-Louis Richard's screen adaptation of Emmanuelle Arsan's... novel? Memoir? Who knows? (Actually, not where it truly began; there was an Italian adaptation in 1969, but it certainly didn't explode the way this did.) Arsan, played by Sylvia Kristel, goes to Thailand to join her husband, and finds herself in a number of erotic entanglements with various folks. (Of especial note: Christine Boisson, also at the beginning of her career.) As is to be expected form this sort of film, you're not going to get much in the way of technical excellence or brilliant scriptwriting; the focus here is on flesh, flesh, and more flesh, tied together with the most tissue-thin of plots. If you like that sort of thing, of course, this is one of the most important movies ever made. If you don't, it's the start of a plague. For the rest of us, it's just bad softcore that hasn't aged well. * ",1248739200,3,970,4.733727810650888
190940,3,1572522550,"I have heard of this and seen clips for many years, but had never watched the whole thing until now.  I must admit that, in the era of AIDS and rather the very high quality ""relationship"" films that have since come out, this appears rather crude and banal.

If you look at it in historical context, there are things you can say about it.  The 60s are past, and so when its values were really engraved into the collective mind was the 1970s.  Free love, unencumbered relationships, no worry for consequence, the search for total satisfaction, etc. etc.  This film embodies all that with a totality that makes it a work of art, I suppose, even if it is soft porn.  The viewer can imagine that there is some kind of philosophy that makes sense behind it, that there is a point that is deeper than mere titillation.  You get masturbation uninhibitively portrayed - a great thing for adolescents to say the least, which I was when this came out - and bizarre sex.  (In a word, it is very effective as eroticism:  Kristel is an astonishing beauty and good actor.)

However, as a film, it is pretty mediocre.  A naive wife with a libertine husband moves to Thailand for his diplomatic job.  She enters a world of pleasure seeking that is beyond simple promiscuity and infidelity:  she seeks perfection in love and eroticism, mixing them to her peril.  By the end, she finds them as a garish self-styled whore, which is supposed to represent a profound psychological  transformation as some kind of ideal.  OK.  We know, with experience, that this is both unattainable (if you value such things as a good marriage of intimate partners) and in the AIDS era, sincerely dangerous.

Thus, it is a mistake to regard this as meaningful.  It is pornography, pure and simple.  I would recommend it as such.  But it is not a very good film experience.",1246492800,5,1834,4.598765432098766

It is about a young, French woman who joins her husband in Bangkok... There much of Emmanuelle's allure is that she isn't shy about her body, or even afraid to engage in sexual activity in semipublic places...

There are a number of rousing, lesbian meetings very typical of French cinema, coupled with encounters with handsome, sensitive men who enjoy superficial lovemaking... The film really deals in sensual images and an over-blown, continuous repeating of its erotic philosophy... There is sensual intimacy between Emmanuelle and the other women that is rare in the cinema...

Sylvia Kristel performance was a major force in the success and popularity of the movie. Other actors put in a fair effort in support. The story line is excellent and content outstanding. I enjoyed the music, exotic locations whether real or studio, made it all look real and worked well.
A break-through for its time and it is still ahead by todays standards, connoisseurs of fine art erotic movies will find this deliciously enjoyable. I only wish all of the erotic scenes that were removed, to pass censorship, were again included in this version, maybe one day it will be when society matures.",1194739200,18,839,4.793103448275862
190944,4,1572522550,"An Adult, not rated, film

This is the first film in a trilogy (there are actually some other films that followed, just like Asimov's Foundation ""Trilogy"" ended up being more than three books) that stars Sylvia Kristel as Emmanuelle and spawned a large number of copy-cats (most of which go by the name Emanuelle).  This particular film is based on Emmanuelle Arsan's 1957 book ""Emmanuelle.""  This film also stars Alain Cuny, and Marika Green and co-starred Daniel Sarky, Jeannie Colletin, and Christine Boisson.  The film's director, Just Jacekin, also directed ""The Story of O.""

This is a film about a couple in an open marriage living in Bangkok, the husband is a diplomat.  The film opens with Emmanuelle in Paris getting ready to head off to join her husband in Bangkok for the first time.  Once she arrives, she is introduced to the Bangkok culture and the Europeans living there (and their loose ways).

There are numerous interesting scenes, like: when the Thai butler chases after one of the maids and ""mauls"" her; when the Europeans living in Bangkok gather together and socialize next to a pool, and one of the woman flirt with Emmanuelle (some top-less, some completely nude, like Emmanuelle, extended scene of her and another woman swimming nude underwater); the scene when one of the women from the pool party shows up and touches Emmanuelle while she is sleeping, and then later, top-less, they talk on the porch and both pleasure themselves (Emmanuelle: as she recalls her activities aboard the plane on the trip to Bangkok where a man just walked up to her and started fondling her and more right there in the open and others, separately, joined in the fun); the lesbian scene at the racquetball club; then the numerous scenes with the female Bee and Emmanuelle traveling in Thailand; another scene at the athletic club, this one in the locker room; then the numerous scenes where Emmanuelle is under the control of an older man who forces her to do things she might not particularly like with various strange men, and some things which are definitely rape.

Red-headed Emmanuelle is something of an experienced yet naive girl in this first film in the trilogy, until she is lead into ""eroticism"" by an older man (that older man's lessons: love between couple's should be outlawed, every act should include three people).  In this film there are scenes seen through the point of view of Emmanuelle and some through the POV of her husband.

An interesting little film that seems to be of a higher quality than you might find now-days, but still seems to be nothing more than an excuse to jump from one ""adult"" scene to another, with some non-adult scenes in-between.

Interesting little trailer, notes that the French president banned it forever, until a new government ""set it free."" Oddly enough, until I watched it again for review, I thought this had been a better movie than I now think of it. (4.10)",1114732800,69,2922,4.822
190945,4,1572522550,"This is the first of the three original Emmanuelle movies, the ones starring Sylvia Kristel. There were lots of imitators, most ranging from bad to worse and beyond. At the time of the first Emmanuelle, though none of that had yet happened - please hold that happy thought. Perhaps those three weren't high art, but they're generally good entertainment for adults.

Back in the 70s, this was a groundbreaking movie. It was openly erotic, and openly meant for the general public. I'll leave the social commentary to others. For me, it's just a beautiful movie. It's set in beautiful tropical locations. It stars beautiful actresses, back before implants were part of the uniform. Most of all, it shows beautiful (if artificial) exchanges of physical affection between Emmanuelle and just about everyone, man and woman.

Still, there were a few things about this movie that I didn't care for. It usually depicts Emmanuelle as a passive figure, to be led and acted upon. I prefer the stronger character in the sequel. Later parts of the movie depict coercion, something I really don't care for. The haughty poseur at the end was annoying, but distantly true to the book. Still, book's fans shouldn't get their hopes up. This movie is its own creature, and pleasant enough if taken on its own terms.

The important thing to know is that the Lionsgate dvd is the one to get; it is completely uncut, with a 94 minute running time. It is the most complete version available, restoring the infamous 'opium den rape scene' that appears late in the movie.  And just as important, this version does include the original French language audio, with English subtitles, which is so important when watching this, very French movie. Dvd's in the past have only offered that horrible English dub, which makes the movie sound cheap and unprofessional.
