1462289,3,B00005JLX2,"In short, Not bad.  Nothing intelligent.  The chick was hot, Pachino was decent and it was pretty exciting. Worth a rent, but not a purchase.",1053475200,,141,4.6
1462290,3,B00005JLX2,"The Recruit is a movie of the CIA and a man James Clayton (Colin Farrell) who is recruited by Walter Burke (Al Pacino).  The movie follows James through basic training, while Walter as his mentor, of a kind.
This movie was exactly what it was advertised as being.  It is entertaining, perfect for a night when you want to just relax.  Do not plan on watching it if you want a deep thought provoking movie.  If you try to see too much in the movie, then it looses its only appeal.
However, the reason that it only deserves a three is that it was entirely predictable.  A slight twist in the plot would have livened it up a little.  I must admit that I would have been disappointed if I had paid to see in in the theaters.",1053388800,4,720,4.181159420289855
1462291,2,B00005JLX2,"I have to say I was disappointed with this movie. It started out with a relatively interesting premise and the training scenes were quite enjoyable. Unfortunately it then descended into farce, with contrived twist after contrived twist.
The characters were underdeveloped, apart from Farrell and Pacino. Farrell is solid throughout and proves he can carry a film. Pacino, however, seems to be on autopilot and delivers the same shouty performance he seems to give in every film of late.",1050451200,2,486,5.1645569620253164
1462292,4,B00005JLX2,"In a time when terrorism has taken over  instead of the threat of the previous cold war, the CIA is again in need of young vigorous intelligent people and a CIA recruiter, Walter Burke (Al Pacino), finds a young computer programmer by the name James Clayton (Colin Farrell).  The hook that catches James is that his father disappeared under unexplained circumstances and it seems like his father was a CIA agent.  At the Farm, which is what the CIA calls the school where they educate their future agents, James finds out that everything at the Farm is a test.  During his schooling by the CIA, he builds strong feelings for one of the other students and this seems to be very dangerous and he questions whether this is a test or reality.  The Recruit is a suspenseful thriller that keeps the audience engaged with the film from the beginning to the end, which provides a solid experience with a few holes.",1049587200,,906,4.60248447204969
1462450,5,B00005JLX2,Watched this movie for the first time ever today and i was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the movie was. Twist and turns amazing ending. Just remember always a test,1501977600,,169,4.666666666666667

1462453,5,B00005JLX2,This movie is super-good because of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell.  Al Pacino . . . you ask him for 100% and he gives 200% - always.  And Colin's just damn cute.,1494028800,,159,3.9375

1462455,3,B00005JLX2,"Let me start off by telling you that you will be able to get through this movie. Its not a bad movie. But let me tell you that the trailer for the movie is better than the actual movie itself. I wish they would have really stuck with the trailer and built the story around it. If they would have done that this movie would be one of those movies you had to keep in your collection. Al Pacino played his role but the rest of the actors didn't bring the movie home. I have nothing against them at all I'm only stating that they needed more experience because their roles just were not believable. I think if they would not have made it about the CIA, and made it about another organization maybe they could have went into depth and really brought the movie home. But the fact that they were acting like they were the CIA, I bet they had to change a lot of things in the movie so that it did not breech the real CIA protocol or give any of their secrets away. So I don't doubt this movie had the potential to be one of the movies that you want to watch again and again but I believe if they would not have used the plot of being actual CIA's in the movie, the movie would have been better because they could have really did what they needed to do to make the movie good.
The movie is decent. So you want have to turn it off midway through the movie but you won't be able to watch it a second time because there was no depth to the movie. There was no real plot but instead a story that was not well thought out. This movie just was not believable for me in terms of plot. The story did not pull me into it but I kept waiting for it to happen then the end came and I was disappointed. To me it seemed like the producer took several different stories and tied them together and called this movie The recruit.
You will be able to watch this movie all the way through but it won't be something you want to keep.",1487894400,,1904,4.0263852242744065
1462456,1,B00005JLX2,Pacino never needed Colin to do anything he already had the girl stealing the program. Not understanding the whole dad side of the plot either. Colin does good with cool guy roles but as soon as he has to show any other emotion he's done.  I can see why his career stalled.,1484352000,,273,4.25
1462457,5,B00005JLX2,Loved this movie. You can watch it over and over. Collin Ferrell recruited in the CIA by Dustin Hoffman. Great story and better mystery.,1483920000,,136,4.708333333333333

1462553,4,B00005JLX2,I gave this movie for stars because I rather enjoyed it despite the highly implausible nature of the story. Basically a grizzled veteran of the CIA recruits a recent graduate to the CIA then goes through the so-called Farm training to become a CIA agent. Along the way he meets up with a female recruit and they fall for each other.,1473465600,,332,4.459016393442623

1462737,4,B00005JLX2,"Between the end of February 2015 and May 2015 I watched seven (7) movies, in addition to the 10 I previously contributed reviews for, where Colin Farrell played a key role.  In alphabetical order, the 7 movies are: Ask the Dust, Cassandras Dream, Horrible Bosses, Minority Report, The Recruit, Seven Psychopaths and Winters Tale.

I only now became aware that the actor was being honored for his overall achievements in film.  Around mid- May this year, the movie The Lobster was awarded third place (Prix du Jury) in the Cannas Film Festival, which an international award.  But, its the Maui Film Festival Navigator Award that sums up my sentiments of Colin Farrells performances in every movie I have watched so far. Theres nothing I could write that could be more persuasive to get people to watch his movies than recent recognition of the actor and his abilities.  It seems appropriate to  support the actor and the movies Ive watched by posting this in lieu of fleshing out individual reviews.

The following is from MauiNow.com (Posted 06:23 PM HST, June 5, 2015):
Colin Farrell was the recipient of the esteemed Navigator Award, during the Celestial Cinema on Friday night (06/05/2015) at the 16th annual Maui Film Festival.

The Maui Film Festival Navigator Award honors a film artist for carving a path of distinction through the turbulent waters of the entertainment industry without sacrificing their fundamental commitment to excellence.

Colin Farrell is a chameleon who constantly creates one-of-a-kind characters that send pitch perfect pebble-to-boulder-sized ripples through whatever story his performance is helping to tell, said festival founder and director Barry Rivers. In short, Colin is a cinematic force of nature and, for that reason, the Maui Film Festival takes great pride in honoring him with its 2015 Navigator Award.",1433808000,,1848,5.1952861952861955

1462743,3,B00005JLX2,"What seemed like a good film with some elements of suspense, but the Al Pacino swan-song completely blows the ending for me.

Sometimes I wake up as if from a trance in my 2nd guest house (the smaller one without its own pool) with this flick on the built-in flatscreen and don't know how I got there and the screen is paused on Bridge and I think I'm crying and I really wonder what life would be like if I made different decisions",1423440000,,482,4.1063829787234045

1462865,2,B00005JLX2,"Don't be fooled by the very high rating of this film. It's terrible. It starts out with a decent premise. Despite being awkwardly constructed and very difficult to believe, it's on the edge of suspension of belief. But soon after you're given the premise for the movie to kick into the next gear, the script shifts into serious B movie mode. Without giving away important parts of the movie, there is a scene where a character knows he's being followed. He could easily kill the follower. Oddly the character opts to just startle the follower and move on. The only explanation for this has to be that the move had to move in a certain direction. There are also such awkward moments to construct the plot moving forward that it's just laughable. Pacino does his usual superman cool performance, nothing special, as the star is Colin Ferrel. And while his acting is decent, he's really left with stilted moments because the script is so darn awkward. This is a B movie at best. Fine for a cable view on a lazy afternoon but don't expect anything near satisfaction based upon the star rating.",1420848000,,1089,4.647668393782383
1462866,5,B00005JLX2,"I absolutely loved this movie.  Al Pacino is a great actor and this film has a interesting ending.  I did not see it coming by the way that it did.  Colin Firth is an up and coming actor and he played his role quite well.  Ashley Judd is also in it and  when I originally watched,it  she was relatively an unknown actor.  It must have been one of her first movie roles to play.
However, if you like spy movies, try this one on for size. I believe that you will enjoy it as much as I did.",1420588800,,487,3.9081632653061225

Of course some people watch movies just for the action scenes, character interplay, and a bit of romance. If you're one of those people, you might enjoy the movie, because the actors are good, within the limits set by the implausibility of parts of the script.

James joins other new recruits, including Layla Moore, played by Bridget Moynahan, at ""The Farm"", the CIA's training facility.  Unfortunately, things soon become complicated with an unexpected dismissal and the possibility of a mole inside the agency.  This was a different sort of spy thriller and it was quite something to watch.  Al Pacino was my favorite, but I'm choosing from a cast that did great all-around.  I do question why this film needed a love interest, but Bridget Moynahan wasn't dull, so I'll give my own question a pass.  She fits in well and actually contributes to the story.

We're not spy movie aficionados, but even we could see the gaping holes in the plot where it forced us to suspend our common sense in order to enjoy the movie.

The worst part, however, was just the laziness that was apparent by a few of the gaffes.  Early on, Pacino states that his hometown is ""Oak' uh luh"" Florida.  It's Ocala, and pronounced ""Oh CAL uh.""  I mean, seriously, they throw in a city name into the script and no one bothers to check the pronunciation?

1463243,5,B00005JLX2,"2003 was a huge year for Colin Farrell.  He was in nearly everything.  Sadly, he was in a lot of the same kind of stuff and pretty much pigeonholed his career for a while, unlike Jude Law who took 2004 by storm with a slew of various projects.  Still, I've always been a fan of Farrell and I have a very soft spot for his work in `The Recruit', since I kind of love this movie to pieces.

For genre fluff that is pretty predictable and generic in parts, it stretches itself and has a lot of fun and proves to be great entertainment from start to finish.

`The Recruit' follows a young CIA hopeful named James Clayton who suffers recruitment camp only to find out he's been let go due to his breakdown during a test.  Thinking he's lost all he tried to achieve, he is dumbfounded when he is contacted by his instructor, Walter Burke, with a top secret assignment.  He's even more confused when it turns out the he is targeting a young woman who trained with Clayton, Layla Moore.  Clayton starts to second guess his assignment and his discoveries as he delves deeper into his role in this strategically paced cat and mouse game.

Farrell is spot on and really works magic in the role, and Bridget Moynahan is beautiful to look at and compelling to watch.  Al Pacino gives an admirable performance, considering his track record as of late.  He doesn't do anything offensive here, even if he does coast a bit.  While Farrell's other films suffered from an almost placid approach (`S.W.A.T.' was an overlong bore and `Phone Booth' doesn't deliver thrills upon recent viewings), `The Recruit' is truly entertaining, even on a third, fifth or tenth viewing (this is one of those films I could watch anytime, anyplace).  It may not entirely make sense (how many of these type of thrillers do) but with proper suspension of disbelief this film will prove to be everything you want.",1357257600,,1873,4.57185628742515

The recruit is an excellent movie that gives some very real insight into the world of national security and the inherent flaws in any intelligence agency that does not have sufficient controls, oversight, and transparency.  This movie is all too real in showing what actually has happened repeatedly in our intelligence agencies, where rogue agents are allowed to set up their own private operations that have nothing to do with national security and often betray our national security.

The compartmentalization used by such agencies has created a monster that is undermining our nation from within far faster than any foreign power can from without.

It also deals nicely with some of the primary tools of such agencies such as betrayal and psychological manipulation.  It reveals in great detail the slimy, sleazy, sorry underbelly of espionage.

I have seen this movie on cable before and they cut it up so much the movie loses its impact.  Watching it on DVD is much better.

This movie is a perfect example of why JFK had planned to dismantle the CIA and why Jimmy Carter severely reduced their numbers.  It is easy to pass this off as just another thriller or suspense movie, but if you pay attention this movie has a lot of very real and important information to reveal.

The acting is first rate as well.",1329523200,2,1334,4.8370044052863435
1463442,4,B00005JLX2,"James Clayton (Colin Farrell) is a brilliant computer programmer about to graduate from MIT.  He shows his latest program at a computer exhibition to a Dell executive and gets a job offer.  Walter Burke (Al Pacino) talks to James and tries to recruit him for the CIA. He tells James to take the life of adventure instead of the ho-hum life of the middle class.  The final bait is an admission of knowledge of how James's father disappeared and that he worked for the CIA.

James signs up and passes all the tests with flying colors.  He finds out that Walter is a Chief Instructor at The Farm which is the CIA training school.  James meets Layla Moore (Briget Moynahan) and the mutual attraction to each other is hot.  James excels at every aspect of training but fails a psychological torture test and is washed out of The Farm. What follows is a good spy movie with a twisted and multi-threaded plot.  It is difficult to separate the good guys from the bad guys and the suspense of the movie continues to build throughout the story.

Colin Ferrell and Al Pacino do a good job in this movie and the acting is good.  What kept this movie from being 5 stars is the twisted plot (plots) and the end result becoming so predictable.  It is a fair action/spy movie but it could have been better.",1328572800,,1290,4.446808510638298

1463446,5,B00005JLX2,"""The Recruit"" is the kind of movie where it will keep you guessing the whole time. Director Roger Donaldson does a wonderful job at keeping you guessing through the whole film.

""The Recruit"" is about a bunch of CIA trainees who get recruited. Character James Douglas Clayton (Farrell) is recruited by agent Walter Burke (Pacino). Once recruited, James has to go through training where Burke teaches him how to think and even pretends to cut him from the program. The most famous quote from this film comes from burke, he always says ""nothing is what it seems"".
In order to not give away any spoilers, I can't say much more about this film.

1463449,5,B00005JLX2,"It's always interesting to watch a movie that was filmed in your back-yard and even though the Washington Navy Yard (where I work) is nothing like it is depicted in the movie (I am guessing the filmmakers could not gain access to the secured home of NCIS) this movie still has enough local color to keep Washingtonians interested.
But aside from that, this movie is a generally entertaining thriller with some excellent performances by Al Pacino, Colin Farrell and the criminally underrated Bridget Moynahan. Farrell plays James Clayton, a brilliant computer programmer who moonlights as a bartender who is recuited by CIA headhunter Walter Burke (played with flair by Pacino). After passing the entrance test Clayton (along with fellow recruit Layla Moore played by Moynahan) is sent the CIA traing facility nicknamed ""The Farm."" What follows is a thrilling action adventure with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer enthralled.
The 2003 movie may not have appeared an obvious choice to be one of the earlier Blu-ray catalog titles (released June 3, 2008) due to its rather bleak look, but I am certainly glad it was picked because its 1080p transfer is really quite good. Though not reference quality it is quite pleasing with enough of those high definition details (such as Farrell's trademark stubble), clarity and color reproduction to please PQ enthusiasts.
The audio is somewhat average by comparison with good balance and a pleasing surround effect, and the Blu-ray of ""The Recruit"" is undoubtedly the best soundtrack you are ever likely to hear for the movie.
The special features are a little on the sparse side (which is not really surprising considering its catalog status) but we do get a feature commentary track with director Roger Donaldson and actor Colin Farrell (who sports his actual Irish accent). It's the kind of track I personally enjoy with plenty of anecdotal stories from the set and Donaldson offering uo some technical information on the production.
All of the video special features are in standard 480p quality and include four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Donaldson and Farrell, a too-short ""Spy School: Inside the CIA Training Program"" which runs at 15:58 and (as the title suggests) takes a look at the actual training school for the CIA (including an instance where the movie is not accurate) with on-camera interviews with 25-year veteran of the CIA Chase Brandon and the cast and crew. Also included is a rather pointless Movie Showcase that displays some select scenes to showcase the benefits of HD picture and sound (which if you have the Blu-ray you are already sold on anyway.
This is an entertaining movie and although the Blu-ray features a rather average HD picture and sound it is still the best representation of the movie you are likely to see.",1256169600,3,2813,5.012820512820513

The surprise is learning who is the target!

We see James at work delivering mail, and also logging into the target's computer. [There are easier ways to do this.] James discovers the secret information is on Leila's home computer. How did it get there? James chases a contact, shots are exchanged, and James wins. [Could this happen in a train station in Washington DC?] The drama continues when he meets Leila and learns her story. Then he meets with his contact Walter Burke. There is a surprise ending.

1463727,3,B00005JLX2,"An oft-repeated phrase throughout this film is that with the CIA, nothing is what it seems.  Unfortunately, that is not always true.  If this film seems to drag a bit at times, that is what it seems.  If it seems a bit repetitive and lacking in originality in dialogue and plot situations, that is what it seems.  If it seems that the star power of Al Pacino and Colin Farrell aren't enough to raise this film from B-film levels, that is what it seems.

Farrell is supposed to be a techno-geek.  Okay, most techno-geeks I know do not look like Colin Farrell even on Farrell's worst day.  So, suspension of disbelief is required from the outset (one can make the same criticism of Keanu Reeves in the Matrix films, but those were much better films).  Farrell as James Clayton is a programmer geek by day, sexy bartender by night (that part is convincing).  Clayton is the sort of person that Walter Burke (played by Pacino) seems to want in the CIA, so he sets out to recruit him.  Clayton has a secret buried in his past - his father disappeared, and he always suspected that it was a CIA or some similar agency operation that caused it.

Forward to 'the farm', a training ground for CIA operatives.  Most people wash out, and Clayton (apparently) does, too.  However, he is then recruited again by Burke to be a super-sleuth - the kind of operative that works off the books and under the radar.  The mission is to secure a computer programme capable of taking over virtually the entire plugged-in world, which exists in the computers of the agency, but nowhere else.  Of course, the computers at the agency don't have disc drives or printers or any other such storage devices to make theft easy.

This is the first point at which the story goes off the rails, because the theft mechanism appallingly simple, and we find during at least one scene that the agency's computers are internet-linked to an agent's home computer.  So much for not being able to get information off the reservation.  But I digress.

Farrell's confused acting put together with Pacino's overacting lead to a less-than satisfying, anticlimactic denouement.  There are plots within plots, and, true to form, the storyline tries to craft each person as being not what he or she seems, except that the viewer can figure out fairly quickly who is and is not in the frame.

The deleted scenes don't add much to the overall experience of this film, and the final scene, alas, is definitely a set-up for a sequel, should we ever be so unlucky as to find this being made.

If it seems that there was potential for this film, between the actors and the idea, that is what it seems.  Unfortunately, it seems that the film could never decide whether to be a mystery or an action film.  In the end, it comes close without quite reaching the level of being good at being either.

One thing that might be worthwhile is the featurette, 'Spy School:  Inside the CIA Training Program' - however, does anyone really believe that the agency is going to put very much of high security value out before the public on a mass-market DVD?  Again, nothing is as it seems.

This would be a great film to be remade a decade or two from now, with a better script and tighter plot, and a decision as to whether it is in the action or the mystery genre.",1138665600,3,3297,4.532994923857868
1463728,5,B00005JLX2,"This film seems very well researched, seeing as a former Directorate of Operations operative now public relations employee Chase Brandon, whom usually consults on authentic CIA portrals in hollywood movies such as Bad Company, Bourne Identity, Bourne Supremacy, etc.  Although Chase has said in a DVD feature about certain aspects of the CIA not being acknowledged or not true, I would bet the techniques of combat that are brief in the film are authentic as well as disguising NOC agents through deceptive methods and the plot is mostly made up since I would suspect that the senior and / or higher ranking officers of the CIA would know of conflicting missions, even though to lower employees, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  This is the suspense in the movie that I will not spoil.

I loved the movie, even though I didn't really like Al Pacino's character, Walter Burke.  However, I felt that this should have been a movie that introduced us to the main characters like the first X-Men movie and felt it needed to continue with sequels.  It almost like they were setting up James Clayton, Colin Farrell's character, as one recruit that was destined to do great things after this movie's plot was done.  Plus, James Clayton has to be paired with Layla Moore, Bridget Moynahan's character, to help in these great tasks.  Zack, Gabriel Macht's character, I loved and wished that his character continues on.  I also loved Karl Pruner's character, Dennis Slayne, which I thought all the more hinted at a sequel by his character being James Clayton's new mentor.

That is not something you do to a student that has millions of taxpayer dollars invested in them. I did like all the twists and turns and Pacino puts in a good dramatic performance. The only dissapointment was we knew all along Colin Farrell was being manipulated by him. So there was no surprise there. I understood from the start that Pacino's character was not his friend.

By the next evening it was in my possession, and despite having already watched the ending, I found it to be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Al Pacino aced his role as Walter Burke, CIA trainer extraordinaire, and he's not a guy I would ever want to play poker with, even if I did play poker.

Colin Farrell's performance is pretty much like his other movies(except maybe ""Alexander"", but I haven't seen that yet, and I hate his blonde look), but he really does a great short, dark and handsome, tortured and persecuted thing. This time he's out of the phone booth and using his cell phone, whizzing through movie-style computer gibberish as James Clayton, the star recruit of the latest batch of CIA trainees.

Bridget Moynahan gives much the same performance as she does in ""I, Robot"", playing it smart and sassy with a real cute pout, and a concerned wrinkle.

Surprises and twists abound, and though you know it's all faked, and nothing is what it seems, it still draws you in.  In retrospect, the ending really is the silliest part of the movie, the moral of the story being to sit down and relax whenever you see red dots before your eyes.

Farrell is recruited by Pacino, and undergoes intense training...only to break under pressure. Or so it seems. Pacino is Pacino, so of course his performance is outstanding.

Bridget Moynihan (Sum of All Fears) co-stars as fellow recruit and would be lover for Farrell.  (...) she possesses a strong sense of character in this multi-leveled role.  Gabriel Macht in a smaller role as Zach is also very good, as Moynihan's other possible love interest.

Pacino predictably chews up all the available scenery as a CIA recruiter, and Farrell is the MIT grad with the deus ex machina software recruit of the title. The film spends a little time at The Farm (the not-particularly-secret CIA training facility -- the counterpart to the FBI's training facility in Quantico) before moving to Washington, DC and an intrigue concerning one or more moles within the CIA and a not-as-complex-as-it-looks whodunnit mystery.
While there are a few wrinkles in this mystery -- who's the guy in the hooded jacket, for instance -- mostly the enjoyment of this film comes down to how they hit the fairly standard plot points, not which plot points they choose to hit. In the interests of keeping the plot moving, most of the training on the Farm was unfortunately cut -- watch the DVD extras for a glimpse at what is, perhaps, the most interesting part of the film.

1463898,3,B00005JLX2,"Roger Donaldson's films have always the same trait, which many film buffs can easily detect; that is, A) it starts with superb premise; B) it gives fine acting from the stars; C) it ends not so well.  Look at ""No Way Out"" or ""Dante's Peak.""  (""Thriteen Days"" is one exception.)  And with ""The Recruit,"" did he change?  Apparently not.
So, the film starts well.  Al Pacino literally recruits a MIT computer wiz Colin Farrell.  Come with me, and work for CIA.  Al (with thick beard) trains him with other applicants in ""The Farm,"" where the US government secretly teaches ABC of being spy.  But the young Colin soon realizes that he can trust nothing during the tricky course of the training.
The first half is pretty interesting even though the training programs are obviously imagination of the filmmakers.  Of course, CIA must have shown some part of the facilities but if there should be really 'The Farm,' they will neither affirm nor deny the existence of it, let alone show it to you.  But still the production designs are polished (like that of ""Anti-Trust"") and the story is stylishly done.
The problem is the second half, in which another character (played by Bridget Moynahan) steps in.  Quite honestly, the plot is predictable to the discerning eyes of the fans of the genre, and I want no more not-so-stylish use of guns, chases, and so on.  And the conclusion is a huge letdown, or in other words, impossible.
Another weakness is (don't worry no spoilers) the characters' motives.  Why Colin's character wants to be a spy when he is a top student from MIT?  It is explained in the opening credits, but it is not strong enough.  Moreover, the film even seems to forget that original motive in the long and widing road of mysteries that come again and again, as if never content with the initial premise.  Surprise is surprise when it seldom comes, but in ""The Recruit"" they rush to you like avalanche.
Al Pacino, one of the greatest actors living, is not bad, but not good either.  At least his beard is not a good idea, making him too conspicous (hey, he is working for CIA, isn't he?).  He is much better in other films like ""The Insider"" (or any of his films in the 70s).  Colin Farrell is just fine, but I am afraid his turn in ""Phone Booth"" is much more convincing as the man in the extraordinary situations.

Farrell plays an ace computer programmer haunted by the death of his father over a decade earlier.  Pacino is a recruiter for the CIA who hints that Farrell's father may have been a member of the company.  Farrell enlists and trains for field work; this recruitment and training takes up around half the movie.
The second half of the story has Pacino - one of the main trainers - recruiting Farrell for his first assignment, dealing with a mole within the Agency.  Although some of the plot twists are foreseeable, others are less obvious, and if the ending wraps up everything a little too neatly, it is nonetheless satisfying.
In certain ways, this is a rather standard suspense flick, but as said before, it is the writing and acting that help it excel.

Does the ides fail in Hollywood the same manner the companies bankrupt in Wall Street?
In a quick view, there is no plot, but simple twisting and re-twisting of incidents, like guessing is the name of the game.
The film has an optimistic start, putting you in suspense for discovering how the CIA's special agents are trained, and not with the 'comic' impression you get from James Bond movies; however, disappointment is imminent very soon, where tutors in CIA does not distinguish Abu-Nidal Group (extreme left terrorist ended in small office in Baghdad) from Hamas (Muslim militant against Israeli occupation of Gaza and West Bank), without the help of the ""Nothing is as it seems"" reference or professor.
Then there is some weaving of the plot in the training and in the interaction between two fresh-made agents, but with big holes in the texture: like shooting and running in the subway in crowded cities is that easy eh? Then why Bin Laden didn't come to shelter there?
Finally an end that is imitating Scarface, but in a shrinking way that suit this metamorphosis movie.
It happened that I bought this DVD with Basic together, so I had double disappointment, and maybe this is why I wanted to criticize both vigorously.

The plot is that a young man is recruited by a CIA operative played by Al Pacino and soon nothing is what is seems. The problem of course is that for such a film to work one has to care. In this rather slow moving film one does not care and one tends to go to sleep as the plot plods on and on.
The film is devoted mainly to the training given to CIA recruits. What is portrayed is vaguely like the training done for those who join the Mossad. One wonders how realistic it is as a large number of actual CIA employees would be desk jockeys who would look at a computer all day. Never the less we follow our intrepid hero as he and his class mates learn the secrets of counter intelligence, or maybe just intelligence. The background is that the central character?s father might have been a CIA agent and this mystery gives the Al Pacino power to manipulate him.
The central premise to the film is totally absurd and plot hole follows plot hole. The manipulation of the main character is so transparently stupid that one would think that six year old children would say, this is not real.

It examines the agencies recruiting techniques and the intense and unique training the new recruit must go through in order to become a full operative. Colin Farrell plays the new recruit acquired by the agencies veteran recruiter and instructor, played by Al Pacino.
The film communicates well the reality that, out of all the law enforcement organizations, the CIA is the most thankless of the lot. We only hear about them when they fail, never when they succeed. The heroes who have died in the line of duty in the field are never named, but are coldly referred to by only a star and the year they perished. But why would anyone want to be a CIA operative? It's not about money because they're under paid. It's not about fame because, for the most part, throughout their careers, they remain anonymous. These spies work gruelling hours and are constantly on the move, packing and unpacking, and sometimes go for months, even years away from their families. The film addresses this question in an interesting and entertaining way.
The underlying theme of the film is the notion that nothing is as it seems. The only thing you can believe is that you cannot believe anything. Trust no one because everyone has an agenda. Building relationships is not done for the obvious reasons but to use as a means to an end. The mission is everything and exploitation is the means to the goal. You have to be a certain type of person to do this kind of thing. I've always wondered how undercover agents can live with themselves and how terribly lonely this profession would be. This film expresses all these things compellingly.
~The Recruit~ is also a great story with many twists and turns. Nothing is what it seems until the end. This is a stylish thriller produced well and directed with skill. The DVD also includes interviews with the producers and a true twenty-five year CIA veteran that acted as a consultant on the movie. The film is instructive and entertaining.

He ends up at ""The Farm"" which is almost like a boarding school for trainees. There Farrell falls for another trainee nicely played by Bridget Moynihan. The web grows more and more complex as Farrell is thrust into a position to out a double agent that has infiltrated ""The Farm"" and the CIA in hopes of obtaining a powerful computer program called Ice 9.

Roger Donaldson has directed a number of terrific pictures. This isn't one of them. Everything is EXACTLY as it appears in this predictable and routine thriller. Hitchcock would have been ashmed at the mundane writing and plotting of this lazy thriller. This is connect the dots screenwriting; you know exactly where the film is going, how it's going to get there and what the outcome is within the first hour of the film.

The film is saved by a couple of nice performances by Pacino, Farrell and the marvelous Bridget Moynihan. The extras highlight what is known about the real CIA Farm and what sort of training they go through. Our guide is a real CIA operative (or so he says--maybe things aren't as they appear...mmmmm). The best thing about the film is the glimpse into what might be the mode the CIA uses to train and wash out recruits to the agency. Regardless, it's clear it would take a special type of person to work for the CIA; as Pacino points out, it ain't for the money, the chicks or the fame as they don't get any of that. It's a pity because the folks that do work for the CIA (whether or not you agree with what they do)certainly deserve a better film to celebrate them than this half hearted thriller.",1059868800,,1821,4.446107784431137

Colin, at the top of his game, supposedly washes out, but is set up outside of the system to spy on the other recruits.  He falls in love with one and kills another.  And the movie mercifully concludes after the only (painfully obvious) twist is revealed to us at the end.
As a nerdish fantasy come to life, this video isn't bad.  But as an espionage-based thriller, the storyline leaks like a sieve.  With the excessive role playing, The Farm ends up looking like a weekend theater workshop.  And if this movie is any indication of their true professionalism, it's no wonder that the (real) CIA completely botched up any assessment of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

1464184,3,B00005JLX2,"A Film by Roger Donaldson
The Recruit is a film about the CIA and a training facility called ""The Farm"". Walter Burke (Al Pacino) is a teacher at The Farm and is trying to recruit James Clayton (Colin Farrell) to join the CIA. Clayton is intrigued both by how Burke sells the CIA and also because Burke claims some knowledge about Clayton's father (who disappeared/was killed in 1990). Clayton goes along for the ride and the first half of the movie is the training at the Farm.
The first half of the movie (barring the first 5-10 minutes) is by far the best of the movie. If the quality would have held up, this could have been a great movie. During the training we meet Layla (Bridget Moynahan), who may or may not be a spy. Burke tells Clayton early in the movie that nothing is as it seems. If we keep that in mind we have to accept that anything we are presented is a lie. This makes the first half of the movie very interesting but also makes the second half of the movie fairly conventional. Nothing is really wrong with it, but nothing is really right with the second hour. There are a couple of twists that aren't really unexpected, but nothing too spectacular.
Here's the bottom line: I enjoyed watching the movie, but it was ultimately empty and forgettable. Al Pacino gets to give a nice speech (a wonderful, but typical Pacino explosion), and everyone does a good job, but the movie is just lacking...I think it is lacking any kind of real story. If you want to see a better movie in this genre, see Spy Game. It's a much better movie.",1059436800,13,1548,4.397212543554007
1464185,4,B00005JLX2,"For anyone who has ever had any contact with the real world, many of the premises of this unlikely thriller are so far fetched that they create an air of unreality early on. But if you are enough of a Pacino fan, as I am, you let it go and suspend your critical faculties and just go along for the wild ride you have just buckled in for.  The initial thirty minutes of this two-hour travelogue into the heart of the CIA spy world is interesting and appealing, as is the fast paced and thrilling last thirty minutes. The middle hour tends to slow way down, with more than a little gratuitous sex (to prove the two lead actors of Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan are `hot'?) and a great deal of extraneous dialogue between them and between Farrell as the `recruit' of the title and a wonderfully droll Pacino as his `mentor' (read ""handler"" here). The central lesson in this diverting and often surprising potboiler is that ""nothing is as it seems"", a it is as so depressing and cynical at points to make you want to put the DVD on ""pause"" and go have yourself a decent leisurely cry.

But the action resumes with a vengeance, just as one is beginning to despair that this may actually be a message movie in drag. The plot is plausible, though it is sometimes adrift in the trees a bit. Farrell, a recent MIT computer whiz, is seduced into dissing a career shot with Dell Computers to chase the chimera of his father's murky past as an agent with the CIA. Apparently the ""Agency"" believes in legacy appointments now,  so Farrell is whisked away to ""The Farm"", a reference to an idea quite blatantly stolen from the John LeCarre novels like ""Smiley's People"" about the British Intelligence Services' training ground for agent initiates. Here he keeps relearning to depend on no one but himself and his native intellect and intuition, for outside these narrowly confined perimeters, nothing is in fact what it seems to be. Nothing.
The acting is good, and the cast seems believable given the twisting and turning plot and the mysterious devices that employed to keep us guessing as to what is happening. What is Pacino really up to? When does the training and tests ever end? As we speed toward the conclusion, we begin to understand the level of resident suspicion an agent must develop and maintain to survive in the fractiously perilous world of the secret world of clandestine operations. Do not rent this movie expecting it to be a realistic reflection of life as an agent for any of the so-called intelligence services. Instead, accept as a Hollywood confection designed and contrived for you evening's entertainment. Intelligent and thoughtful it is not, but as an exciting and pleasant way to escape into the never-never land of fiction and daring-do, it is a lot of fun. Enjoy!",1059004800,,2784,4.665987780040733
1464186,3,B00005JLX2,"I love Al Pacino, and I really enjoyed the movie when I saw it last nighht. But now, thinking about it, alot of it seemed really ridiculous. I won't go into the story--many have done that already. But these are my points:
First, you would think that James would be a little suspicious of having to break into Layla's computer. I mean, Burke could've done so himself after hours or on the weekend. There was no reason to sneak into it while she was at work.
Second, what was the deal with Layla and Zack? It's never explained why they were working together--doing what? What was Zack's role? In fact, what job did Zack get after he finished at the Farm? And that note she passed to him? Duh, how about just telling him in person when they were at work. They are allowed to speak to eachother. And then why did Zack run and then fire at James? Makes no sense at all. In fact, it was one of the stupidest scenes in the movie.
Third, didn't James think it odd that he was working only with Burke? Burke was the head instructor at the Farm. Why would James be dealing with him on this mission? He also would've been hooked up with others, and given a thorough briefing on his new role as NOC. Not just told in a car by his instructor and then set to work. Again, really stupid.
Fourth, the ending is pretty dumb, when you think about it. And we don't really know what happened? Did James really wash out at the Farm? Was he really a NOC? Was he still in the CIA? He's sitting in a car with another spook, going to be debriefed, and the guy tells him that it's in ""his blood."" So what does that mean? Is he in or out?
Fifth, it seems that if Burke really wanted this program, he had enough access to figure out a simpler means of stealing it. He had enough clout there, and supposedly, as a spy of 27 years, enough brains to figure out something more foolproof, involving less people and less chance of a slip-up.
This could have been a good movie, as I liked the beginning about the training. But then it just slipped. Too many loopholes, too much idiocy, not enough real plot.",1058832000,,2072,4.248101265822785
1464187,4,B00005JLX2,"I would definitely have to say that this is quite an intriguing movie with a well thought out plot and acted out well by all concerned.  Al Pacino, what can you say about Al Pacino; in every movie he does he's Al Pacino and that's what makes him the brilliant actor he is, change the name of the role, it doesn't matter what and you still have Al Pacino.  Colin Farrell does an admirable job in this movie as well as does Bridget Moynahan.
The movie purports to be ""loaded with twists and turns,"" which is a statement I will agree with, whether they're suspenseful twists and turns is in the eye of the beholder.  The one thing that sets a movie apart from others is that it turns out something new, something that hasn't been seen before.  With ""The Recruit,"" yes we get to see ""The Farm"" which is very interesting in and of itself, but overall, many of the plot twists that are there to ""surprise"" and raise the level of tension before the payoff, all seem to be somewhat predictable.  This is not to say that the film is not enjoyable, because it is, it's just not groundbreaking.
The premise:
Al Pacino plays a CIA recruiter and he sets his sights on Colin Farrell's character for recruitment into the CIA's training program.  After some interesting initial scenes, we're taken to ""the farm"" where we see the main character going through the training program.  Where the plot picks up is when he's no longer in the training program and is out on ""the mission.""  What follows, is as stated above, an intriguing movie with some interesting plot twists and turns.
I would definitely recommend this movie as either for the DVD collection or a rental depending on ones purchasing habits.  {ssintrepid}

The young Farell rapidly becomes embroiled in a ""mole"" hunt and is constantly questioning whether he is still ""in training"", or really in danger. What develops is a series of ""who's watching who"" encounters as he, and his trainee counterpart take part in a cat and mouse scenario, that leaves the viewing audience also playing along. Puritans will probably complain that there is a lack of accuracy in the movie, and that the final revelations seem predictable, but most people will just sit and enjoy the ride.

1464191,4,B00005JLX2,"Al Pacino in one of his best roles as world weary, cynical, sardonic and burnt out Central Intelligence Agency recruiter. His craggy, wrinkled face show it ALL. A veteran of many covert and clandestine missions internationally, he recruits the hero by mainly playing on his unconfirmed belief that his father was a CIA Intelligence Officer who was KIA in Peru. Filmed on location in Canada where the woods are used to represent The Farm, which is the CIA's training facility in Virginia. Its correct name is Camp P____. Here, the recruit of the movie title learns tradecraft which in spy talk is how you do what spies do. He learns ELINT or electronic intelligence like bugging and so on. The recruit learns too the black arts of killing with bare hands or machine guns. He meets the love interest in the movie who is a fellow recruit. Later, he even bugs her while pretending to be deeply in love with her. The classic scene in the car park is where she says, ""..we have 18 seconds before the CCTV surveillenace cameras pick us up."" This leads to a super passionate rip your lips off kissing scene which is really well done. The Polygraph scenes are good too. The Polygraph is a a lie detector which Company employees have to undergo periodically. It is not foolproof as traitors uncovered can testify to. The resistance to hostile interrogation scenes are a bit overdone but what the hell, that's Hollywood. A dark, film noir type location is the Washington Navy Yard where everything comes to a head. The climatic scene is a ritual suicide where the bad guy who obviously chooses death before the State Penitentiary (I won't tell you who as it will spoil the suprise) gets cut to pieces with 9mm rounds from Heckler & Koch MP5A2 SMGs fitted with laser sights. In real life, you simply have to shoot to kill because a wounded target is even more dangerous. Moreover, people riddled with bullets have been known to shoot back and kill their opponent, so the 1 shot kill in real life is pretty much a myth (except for pro snipers). Some scenes were really filmed in the old building of The Company headquarters. A fascinating movie, with many thrills, spills, kills, suspense, a beautiful heroine in danger, and much else, what more could you ask for? A nice insight into the world of espionage where people lie routinely, and where nothing is quite what it seems. A world where the love of money often out-motivates the love of country. This is perhaps the reason why Spying is the world's second oldest profession.

The constant wondering of what was a test and what wasn't kept me entertained throughout. Colin Farrell is an amazing actor who is just now starting to get more staring roles he deserves. He has stolen the scenes in virtually every movie he has been in (that I've seen anyway).
Al Pacino turns in another great performance as the mentor leading Farrell and his colleages deeper down the rabbit hole into a world of confusion and deceit. Bridgette Monyahan does a solid job in support as well.
The ending was a little trivial, and somewhat far-fetched, but overall it was still entertaining throughout.",1058054400,2,704,4.7317073170731705
1464193,4,B00005JLX2,"There is a term I use in cinema. It is called ""Vizzini's Law."" The sharpest of movie buffs will pick up on the obvious reference to Wallace Shawn's character in ""The Princess Bride"" (1987). I use Vizzini's Law when a film manipulates the audience into thinking things will either a) happen, or b) not happen. In ""The Princess Bride,"" Shawn's character gives a speech to Cary Elwes' Westley, where he explains that Westley wants him to think poison is in a certain goblet of wine. ""Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me!"" His speech goes on. The point of it is that Vizzini must deduce what Westley wants him to think from the mess.
And I use this reference when a film does the same as Westley. It pulls the audience's leg so many times, the audience loses count of which one is being pulled. They have to wonder what the filmmakers WANT us to think, then realize that the conclusion of the mess is the OPPOSITE of what they want us to think. Or is it?
Some films that use Vizzini's Law are ignorant and become irritable. But Roger Donaldson's ""The Recruit"" is far from boring, irritable, or ignorant. Sometimes the twists and turns are obvious, but most of the time they are more fun. It's not an especially wonderful thriller, but it's enjoyable, and will welcome a second-viewing to pick up on missed tidbits.
The film is about a mentor and his student. Al Pacino the mentor, Colin Farrell the student. Farrell is James Clayton, a computer whiz-kid who turns down an offer from Dell Computers to become a CIA agent with help from instructor Al Pacino. These set-up scenes move a bit too quickly at times to catch, but I suppose you just need to be able to pick up on certain things.
Clayton goes to ""The Farm,"" a CIA training/recruiting facility that teaches the government's up-and-coming finest what to do. Like go into a bar and come back with women. Right. I doubt the CIA wastes taxpayers' money on such games. But it's fun to watch. As Pacino's character Walter Burke tells Clayton, ""Trust no one. Nothing is what it seems."" This applies to the scene I mention.
The film takes a lot of twists and turns, so many that it probably makes ""Memento"" look pale. But ""Memento"" had clever twists, and ""The Recruit"" has somewhat expected ones. It's not a particularly special film, there's no doubt about it. But it's a heckuva lot of fun to watch, even if its running time is a bit too long. (Only two hours? Felt like two and a half.)
I noticed that the film takes too long in scenes that don't matter, and speeds things up in scenes that do. Take the beginning and the end, for instance. The middle, though entertaining, is very slow-paced, and you can't expect to doze off during it. You might miss a twist.
Al Pacino is a real scene-stealer here, containing a lot of charisma. He uses a lot of recycled actions and cliched dialogue, but it's fun to watch Pacino take a light-hearted character. People criticized Pacino's (performance in) ""S1m0ne."" I embraced it. I embraced ""The Recruit"" even more. No one actor can be expected to come up with Oscar-winners every year, and Pacino knows it, plays to it, and has fun. His character is ruff, tough and gruff, and looks shaggy and unhygienic. He's looking a lot like Serpico with the beard.
Collin Farrell is a talented young actor, and I expect him to go pretty far. He's a lot better than some of the up-and-coming-now-they're-here-and-there's-nothing-you-can-do-about-it (cough-BEN AFFLECK-cough) actors. I enjoy him on screen, much more so than Affleck. Instead of playing the baddie Bullseye in Daredevil, perhaps he should have played the main character himself.
If you're looking for some sly espionage thrills, pick up ""The Recruit."" It plays like ""Spy Games,"" ""The Bourne Identity,"" and a Jack Ryan movie. Well, not really. But it's fun. And according to Vizzini's Law, it's a winner.",1057708800,,4154,4.592193808882907
1464271,2,B00005JLX2,"THE RECRUIT starts off with promise and has some intriguing elements, which makes it all the more disappointing that it ends up being just another Hollywood thriller.  Colin Farrell stars as a young computer guy who is recruited by Al Pacino to join the CIA.  He reluctantly agrees, and undergoes their extensive training.  During training, he meets Layla Moore, an attractive young woman for whom he develops feelings.
From there things take numerous twists and turns, most of which are simply not that believable.  The movie is one of the few that actually examines CIA training, and many of those scenes are inherently interesting.  However, the main case/plot is too convuluted and uninteresting to carry the rest of the movie.  The standard chases and double crosses are all here, and are pretty tired.  It's hard to get excited about a spy thriller that is so static (it's based entirely in the DC area).  Pacino plays his typical role, and Colin Farrell is good, but their performances get lost in the murk.
The best part of the DVD is a bonus featurette that examines CIA training.  The featurette is more interesting than the movie itself, which really shows that the writer and director of THE RECRUIT blew it.",1057363200,3,1220,4.855072463768116
1464272,4,B00005JLX2,"Starring Al Pacino as a hard-boiled instructor in the CIA, this action film moves fast.  The best part is the training of these future CIA agents.  Over and over again their instructor manipulates them until nothing is what it seems and the audience soon realizes that everything is a big setup and a lie.  This is the lesson of the film, but the actors seem unaware of this.
Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan are cast as two future CIA agents. Both are good to look and inevitably they couple up.  Of course there are complications.  And lots of lies.  The plot skips along with accelerating speed, and it's all rather fun to watch.  There's a love scene and a chase scene and attempts to confuse the audience as to just who the bad guy is.
The actors all give good performances and the action never ceases.  But the plot is so convoluted that I never made sense of it.  Nor did I care.",1056758400,,888,4.398773006134969
1464273,2,B00005JLX2,"Although somewhat interesting at the beginning (the only reason that I gave the movie more than one star), this movie has some obvious flaws in the plot which prevent the story from being believable enough to be enjoyable.  For instance, Langley is supposed to be secured to the extent that people cannot remove files by means of a floppy disk (a storage meduim which is very limited in capacity).  However, they can remove files more via a thumb drive (a vastly more capacious medium).  There are numberous other examples of technical flaws.  From a technical standpoint, movies like Short Circuit and War Games are more believable.
There are other problems as well.  In one of the twists in the plot, the female agent hands a note off to field agent saying that Colin Farrell's character ""...showed too much interest in her"".  This event was not one that necessitated her meeting a field agent, she could've spoke to the agent at work.  Yet, she acted like it was urgent for her to pass that note (by the way, this was one of the most important moments in the movie).  There are much many more instances worth mentioning.  However, I don't feel like writing more at the moment (perhaps i'll write more about this film at a later date).
Also, it's derivative of A Beautiful Mind...but not enough to be worth watching.  Don't buy, rent. On second thought, rent A Beautiful Mind instead of this piece of garbage.",1056412800,2,1411,4.699186991869919
1464274,3,B00005JLX2,"Colin Farrell plays a naive and somewhat falsely motivated (was my long-dead dad an agent when he disappered in Peru?) CIA recruit, led on by spymaster Al Pacino and convienently distracted by the just-too-attractive colleague in the training cohort. The mix leads to intrigue and distrust as well as a relatively transparent conclusion.
While not a wholly unrealistic view of the training of an agent (or so I have been told by people who know), the 'everything is a lie' and 'nothing is as it seems' philosophy that permeates the film and provides the basis for foil and counterfoil, was more tiring than entertaining. The method used to circumvent the extensive security at Langley was evident early on, and taxed my imagination.
Al Pacino, with his deep, raspy voice, his cliches (""Rule number one: Don't get caught.""), and his seduction of an all-too-gullible Colin Farrell, made me think of the same snow job he did on Keanue Reeves when Pacino played the devil himself.",1056326400,,976,4.9573170731707314
1464275,4,B00005JLX2,"Now we got your Al Pacino, one of the kings of acting. We got Colin Farrell, (We already know that he is a GREAT actor because his name is Colin) we got the girl (I cant think of her name) Everything required for a secret agent movie, including a twist in plot what we don't have is enough actors taking their roles seriously, or maybe it is the director he may or may not be that expierianced with his job. So why is this movie only a four and not a five, personally I think it needs more action.
This movie has action but not my type of action such as roof chasing, shootout, chopper chase/ car chase/ sex action Mostly the James Bond stuff. If you don't like that stuff you may possibly like this movie. I like it with out it, but I thought that if they had more of it, it would have been better.
This movie has violence, blood, language and brief sex. Nothing to fret about moms. This movie is fine for anyone 12 and over, in my oppiniuion. If I had kids that age I would let them watch it.
To sum it off, This movie is not two shabby and could use a little more action but I enjoyed it and hope that you will two.

1464277,3,B00005JLX2,"""The Recruit"" is a well-made-yet-obviously-cheap CIA thriller that lured moviegoers into the theater based on the casting of Al Pacino and kept them there through a fast-paced first hour. The climax is a little underwhelming, and it's rare to see a thriller actually divided into two halves, but ""The Recruit"" milks about as much out of this concept as it can.
CIA recruiter Walter Burke (Pacino) has his eye on smart, rough MIT graduate James Clayton (Colin Farrell) who's developed a virus-like computer program and is courting offers from various firms to apparently begin cementing illegal monopolies. But James has questions about his father's mysterious death in Peru, and Walter hints at answers...
James enlists in the Company, as it's called, and embarks on a tough, mind-numbing training session on The Farm, which serves as locale for the best parts of ""The Recruit."" It's standard you-are-there-and-ain't-it-cool stuff, but Pacino kicks it up a notch, as he usually does, intoning the grave mystery and importance of CIA  --""They show you your medal. You don't even get to take it home"" -- while he slyly inches closer to becoming a second father to James. Also in training is Layla (Bridget Moynahan) a bit of a plain-faced Jane whose soft eyes nevertheless look like a nice place for James to call home.
A lot is made of the line ""nothing is what it seems"" in the movie, but we can sense the arc not long after the movie's second half begins, after James has been ""thrown out"" of the training program only to be told by Walter that he's been selected for an undercover mission to spy on on a mole within the training unit -- Layla. Inevitably, James will have to choose whom to believe -- the lover or the 2nd dad -- and let it be said that ""The Recruit"" chooses the less interesting of those two options as the villain.
Director Roger Donaldson (""No Way Out,"" ""Thirteen Days"") is very good at these kind of close-quartered, low budget affairs. It's a CIA movie, but there aren't any overseas locales; indeed, the primary sets seem to be a bedroom, the inside of a car and a blank office building meant to double as the CIA. Aside the three prinicpals, the cast is a collection of nobodies
The MacGuffin -- the sinister spy thing everybody's after -- is almost ludicrous, but at least the actors wind themselves up into a believable frenzy over it. Pacino's back in his ""weathered, grizzled"" mode from ""Insomnia"" and ""Donnie Brasco"" and yep, he's still good at it. Farrell is up to the challenge, and while Moynahan may not set the screen ablaze, she's a effectively vulnerable.
""The Recruit"" did decent business during its run through the theater but don't expect a sequel, despite the movie's hints at one.",1055376000,,2722,4.766949152542373
1464278,1,B00005JLX2,The recruit is a pure ego play for Pacino and Farrell. The movie itself makes no sense and isn't even interesting. Avoid this DVD at all costs!,1055376000,5,143,4.333333333333333
1464279,2,B00005JLX2,"There is a popular film genre that Hollywood can't seem to resist remaking at least once or twice a decade.  This genre is what I call The Grizzled Veteran Teaches the Wide-Eyed Rookie.  In THE RECRUIT, director Roger Donaldson tries to combine this genre with several others with only middling success.  Al Pacino is the Grizzled Veteran CIA head spook Walter Burke who takes the Yale educated computer whiz James Clayton (Colin Farrel) as a CIA agent in training.  The training scenes that show CIA boot camp are the film's most interesting even if the training itself is most unbelievable.  If the CIA really teaches its rookie agents how to be neophyte James Bonds, then it is no surprise that the real life CIA is as inept as it is.  For another film with a similar theme try 13 RUE MADELINE in which James Cagney puts his rookie agents through a training regimine that smacks of real-life use.  Director Donaldson seemed fascinated with the turncoat agent played by Richard Conte and reprised his role as sexy Farsi-speaking female agent Layla (Bridget Moynahan), who predictably has a steamy love affair with Colin Farrel.  It is when THE RECRUIT leaves the pseudo-world of CIA training for the pseudo-world of CIA love affairs that this film goes seriously astray.  The manipulating that Pacino pulls on both Moynahan and Farrel is so obvious that he might just as well have attached puppet strings to their limbs.  Without giving away what is supposed to be a surprise ending, I began to suspect that truly sometimes things are exactly what they seem.  Director Donaldson does not make things easy for the audience by linking plot events in such a way that the links connect nowhere.  It is one thing for a director to mislead the audience in a witty way.  It is quite another when that director has so little respect for the audience that he does not even pretend to tie up loose ends that cry out for tying.
It is not Pacino's fault that THE RECRUIT is a glossy superficial film that on one level is a recruiting film much like TOP GUN was fifteen years ealier.  Pacino plays his war-weary character with just the right note.  At times his exhortations to his charges have the ring of Master Po to Grasshopper from KUNG FU.  Still, you would think that a master spook like his Burke character would have been smart enough to take his own good advice.  Colin Farrel is unconvincing as an inchoate piece of play dough waiting to be molded.  The ending is a contrived piece of cinematic fluff that was inserted only because THE RECRUIT was touted as a thriller.  Since this film was not a true thriller, I suggest that for future thrillers, Director Donaldson rent 13 RUE MADELINE to see how legitimate spine-tingling suspense can be generated when a director has respect for his audience.",1055203200,,2797,4.706365503080082
1464280,3,B00005JLX2,"Maybe my sister-in-law is right and I'm too critical of movies, however, I didn't dislike THE RECRUIT because I don't think COLIN FERRELL is hot, I disliked it because it was so run of the mill.  Although well lensed by capable director DONALDSON, the twists and turns the film takes are nothing short of uneventful.  Both leads do a fine job with their characters but because the script is so hollywood cookie-cutter (as sooo many are these days), they, like the film, don't shine that brightly.  Good thrillers are hard to come by because of films like this that lack the ingenuity to challange the viewer both emotionally and mentally the way few truly thrilling movies do.",1055203200,,676,4.760683760683761
1464366,3,B00005JLX2,"This film is a fast paced, cat and mouse, guessing game type of spy thriller. The cinematography is suitably dark and dreary for the most part. The overall cast is excellent. It is the screenplay that is problematic, as it has a great many plot holes and fails to provide sufficient motivation for the actions of its main characters. The ending, unfortunately, is the biggest problem of all. Quite frankly, if the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were run in real life the way it is run in this film, no wonder we have had trouble with intelligence, as that is what is lacking in this film.
Al Pacino plays the role of  Walter Burke, the CIA recruiter whose catch phrase is ""nothing is as it seems"". He woos a potential new recruit,  computer whiz James Clayton (Colin Farrell). Manipulated from the get go by Burke, Clayton, who has daddy issues, reluctantly signs on. He is sent to CIA training school, which is called ""The Farm"".  While at ""The Farm"", Clayton meets fellow recruit,  Layla Moore  (Bridget Moynahan), to whom he is attracted and with whom he is later paired for a training  exercise that proves to be more rigorous than anticipated.
When things at ""The Farm"" do not go as expected , Clayton gets a series of surprises, one of which is that Burke claims that Layla is a mole and it is Clayton's mission to expose her and her handlers. Initially reluctant, Clayton takes on the assignment, though he is clearly conflicted by his feelings towards Layla. There are some intriguing scenes and plot twists leading up to the ostensible denouement of Layla and the ultimate betrayal. The grand finale, however, is laughable, as well as totally ludicrous.
Al Pacino is, for the most part,  good as the somewhat bombastic CIA scout, though at times, he seems more like a flim-flam man in whom only the terminally stupid will believe. This, however, is more attributable to  the script, then to the acting.  Colin Farrell is fine as the wide-eyed recruit with the perpetually scruffy, five o'clock shadow on his face.  Bridget Moynahan is also good as Layla, Clayton's love interest and fellow recruit. While they never really heat up the screen, it is not for lack of trying.

Ok, the story line is weak, or lets hope the CIA doesnt recruit like this, but the film does have its way of keeping your attention through the plot twists and turns.

Bridget Moynahan gives a good performance as Layla Moore, the love interest of Clayton and also part of his objective.  The DVD is okay at the best.
