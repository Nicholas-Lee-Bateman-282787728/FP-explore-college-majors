8548765,5,B00A9WFRVG,"Remarkable tale of Harlan and Anna, their decision not to work for THE MACHINE, but to find a way of living natural lives as free of money as possible. Long before popular movements of the eco-kind, they made their houseboat and floated away. They were young, they made music, they invented solutions on a daily basis, made friends and grew together in laughter and work. Years later, they built a wooden house, grew as much food as they could and lived fulfilling lives. Sadly they had no children, but inspiring story!",1378684800,,520,4.725274725274725
8548766,3,B00A9WFRVG,"Picture quality good. It is a full hour of information. A documentary. Just wasn't what I expected. I grew up going to the Hubbards with family, school trips, and church outings. Seeing first hand their home and artwork. Will keep my copy. I would suggest going to a local showing if you have a chance and then decide wheter to buy your own copy or not.",1363046400,,353,4.363636363636363
8548767,5,B00A9WFRVG,"A remarkable litany concerning the iconoclastic lives of Harlan and Anna Hubbard who lived a Walden-like existence on the Ohio River for 40 years, w/ contributions from Wendell Berry, Will Oldham and Ben Solee. Gives one pause re: our gadget filled, smart phone obsessed lives and what constitutes true fulfillment.",1355356800,,315,5.32
8548768,5,B00A9WFRVG,"""Wonder"" is a beautifully crafted film about the lives of Anna and Harlan Hubbard.  The film follows the Hubbards shanty boat journey down the Ohio and Mississippi; their sustainable way of life while on the boat and after in Payne Hallow, but also of equal importance is the love story between these two remarkable and interesting people. Told through striking visuals and a lovely narration, read by Wendell Berry, I think anyone who is a fan of the Hubbards, interested in a sustainable lifestyle, or adventure will love this movie.",1355184000,,535,4.944444444444445
