2749988,5,B000MV8H3Y,"I had the privilege of seeing Dame Diana Rigg onstage in London four years ago as Mrs. Venable in Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer.  She was, of course, incandescent.  When she was hosting Mystery, she said of her role in Mother Love, ""There are certain roles you don't turn down, and that's why I did it!""  She was right.  This is one helluva role and she plays it brilliantly.  Everyone I know agrees that this one needs to be on dvd.  Every time I contact BBC America, I ask for this to be released.  After Louis Jourdan's Count Dracula and of course, I Claudius, this is my favorite of all the things I've seen on PBS.",1217721600,16,630,4.379310344827586
2749989,5,B000MV8H3Y,"The best Mystery production ever. It came in 3 1-hr episodes, and we all couldn't wait to see the next week's segment.  As tense and chilling as it is, I also found it very funny - Diana Rigg's increasingly desperate attempts to get even with her ex-husband just keep back-firing on her, and everybody else's life, especially her ex's, keeps getting better and better.  I talk about this movie to my friends all the time.  The last really good thing I've seen David McCallum in too.",1216598400,6,482,4.5813953488372094
2749990,5,B000MV8H3Y,Mother Love is one of the best psychological thrillers ever made.  It aired almost 20 years ago and I can still recall many scenes vividly.  I can't imagine why it hasn't been released on DVD.  But it should be!,1216512000,18,211,4.358974358974359
2749991,4,B000MV8H3Y,"Probably one of the best mini series on the BBC in 1989. This is a taut, psychological thriller staring David McCallum and Diana Rigg. It's too bad it was never released on DVD but perhaps now is the time!! Adapted from Domini Taylor's novel (same name) this is a neat, scary story done by some great actors. Can't recommend it enough...",1213228800,19,337,4.540983606557377
2749992,5,B000MV8H3Y,"...for this DVD to be released! Excellent psychological thriller with Diana Rigg in top form. Luckily, I have an OLD VHS copy recorded off cable, but it won't last forever! Release the DVD!!!! Please!",1209772800,22,200,4.911764705882353

2749994,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Mother Love is a great psychological thriller.  Diana Rigg is excellent in her role as a sick and twisted serial killer.  You won't forget the chilling suspense as she plots the murder of her family, and the flashbacks to her youth provide the background story of the adult murderer she has become.  One of a kind...you won't be disappointed.  It's a good scarey movie!",1197849600,32,369,4.71875
2749995,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Maybe I am romanticizing this Mystery (or was it Masterpiece Theatre) presentation, but a lot of other people still talk about it.  IN FACT, a dear friend of mine was talking about Mother Love and remembering Diana Rigg's wonderfully chilling performance.  I want a copy for me, but I really want to get him a copy. If you ever saw I Claudius and shuddered at Livila's knack for poisoning people's bodies, you will enjoy Mother Love. If you marveled at Nancy Marchand's noteworthy performance in the first season of the Sopranos as Toni's mother, you will enjoy Mother Love. What showers were to Psycho, marzipan is to Mother Love. It is an interesting thriller and psychological profile.  The rest of the cast and the whole production is worthy of Rigg's main character.  The world deserves to get goosebumps from watching this miniseries from BBC or Thames or whoever made this happen.",1196380800,67,887,4.854304635761589
2750006,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Like so many reviewers before me, I was unpleasantly surprised to learn that ""Mother Love"" did not find its way to DVD.  Without a doubt this was Diana Rigg's most chilling performance, and one that captured my heart.  It forever distinguished her as an amazingly complex actor; one who skillfully allows us to see her twisted soul, trying in vain to keep her ""lid"" on & function despite her world caving in upon itself.
This performance can be watched repeatedly, with many subtle moments revealing themselves anew.  I hope it won't be too long before it becomes available on DVD/BluRay.",1385078400,4,588,4.86
2750007,5,B000MV8H3Y,"I am happy to see that I am not alone in my long obsession with this marvelous thriller.  Even though it has been more than 20 years since I witnessed Diana Rigg's chilling performance, she left an indelible mark of excellence that few actors have even come close to matching... let alone surpassing.  My family and I have talked about this PBS/Masterpiece special over the years and I went as far as writing my local PBS station (twice, within the past 10 years), requesting a (re)airing of ""Mother Love"" (as well as a (re)airing of the fabulous ""Purlie""-(the musical), starring Melba Moore, Sherman Helmsley, and Robert Guillaume. Unfortunately, I have Never received a response from them. I only recently forgave their lack of decorum once I watched the brilliant production of ""Downton Abbey"". This ""redemption"" does not, however, surpress my longing to see Diana Rigg in what is arguably her finest work. If it is available for purchase...where do I sign up? If it is not,then... Please, Please return this Gem to the screen and put us out of our collective misery.",1361059200,6,1070,4.873626373626373
2750008,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Please, Please, release this incredible BBC series on DVD. This is a must have for any serious collector of quality drama. Just to hear Diana say ""Vinney Kins"" to her next victim sends chills up my spine. This series is in a class all by itself and should be considered timeless. You can read so much into the characters. Rigg is at the pinnacle of her acting ability.",1357603200,2,368,4.426470588235294

2750010,5,B000MV8H3Y,I taped this show when it first aired on PBS in 1989.  It was one of the most shocking roles that Diana Rigg ever played.  She deserved an award.  I let a friend borrow my VHS copy while she was battling cancer and couldn't ask for it back.  I've been searching for this for years and am excited that Amazon will carry it!,1343520000,,322,4.063492063492063
2750011,5,B000MV8H3Y,I have been checking for this mini series for years.  I am asking that this series PLEEEEASE be released. Diana Rigg was terrific (even more that usual) in this series.

2750014,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Does 5 Stars tell you something.

The BBC production of Mother Love is still in my mind years after it was shown on television.
There have been so many BBC productions released on DVD.
Mother Love ranks as one of the very best stories of all time.
I hope that for the sake of all of the fans of this miniseries and for those who have not yet
seen the movie that a DVD will soon be released.
P.S. Does anyone hearing my pleas like MARZIPAN?",1306540800,7,439,4.104651162790698
2750015,5,B000MV8H3Y,"I have just finished watching this miniseries again and, after 20 year, it is still BRILLIANT!!!  It's a little dated considering it was shot in the '80's but it still holds up wonderfully.  The story is excellent and the characters are so great!!! And, I had forgotten it has the wonderful David McCallum in it - a far cry from NCIS's Ducky!!

2750016,5,B000MV8H3Y,"I was 12 ,going on 13 years old when this aired on the BBC and it was later subtitled in the Netherlands. It's one of the most amazing series I have ever seen, ever so slightly the jealousy, hate and revenge getting a firmer grasp on Helena as she tries to hold it all together. I cannot believe it's still not on DVD!!! Please BBC, release this masterpiece on DVD so we can enjoy it again!!!!!",1297036800,3,394,4.197368421052632

2750019,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Am still waiting the release of this incredible mini series to come out on DVD.

2750020,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Audiences fell in love with Diana Rigg in her Avenger role as Emma Peel. I had the good fortune to spot her when my high school English class went to see the Royal Shakespeare on tour at the National Theater in Washington, DC, in 1964. She appeared there in Comedy of Errors. What a versatile actress! IMO she never got quite her due as a dramatic actress. Fans of Avenger will be shocked at the terrifying character she portrays in Mother Love. She revives memories of Gene Tierney in her Oscar-nominated performance in Leave Her to Heaven, a similarly absorbing tale of obsession truly run amok. Coincidentally Mother Love reminded me how much I missed David McCallum once Man from U.N.C.L.E. disappeared beneath the waves. He admirably portrays Rigg's ex-husband, an intellectual musician incapable of fathoming the depths of Rigg's depravity. Like the other reviewer, I have been waiting for this movie to be released for years. It was one of Mystery's finest presentations.",1272672000,8,978,4.969512195121951

2750023,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Mother Love is certainly one of best performances on TV that Diana Rigg has given and ditto for David McCallum. It is a taught, suspenseful psycho-thriller. Since BBC Four is not motivated in releasing Mother Love on DVD, can't some other company buy the rights and issue this on DVD? It's unfathomable how the Mrs Bradley Mysteries can get on DVD and Mother Love can't!",1262217600,,370,4.707692307692308

2750025,5,B000MV8H3Y,"I, too, recorded this program from public television, and it is one of my favorite psychological thrillers, right up there with ""Rebecca"".  Diana Rigg does a superb job playing the mother, and the script is perfect.  I think we've all known someone who we've suspected has the potential for going off of the deep end, given enough provocation, and that's what makes this story so chillingly believable yet so thoroughly entertaining.  In my book this is a classic and is worthy of watching over and over.  Please issue this on DVD!",1257120000,,531,4.802197802197802

Remember there is no Love as strong as a Mothers Love!~

2750030,5,B000MV8H3Y,"This mini series is still rebroadcast in the UK, so I was able to obtain a DVD recorded off TV there.  It's strange that it has not been released on DVD here or in the UK.  I see that one of the local PBS stations is rebroadcasting older programs from Mystery.  I hope they will show Mother Love, and create demand for the DVD.  Really everything from Masterpiece Theater and Mystery should be released on DVD, especially Mother Love and By the Sword Divided.

I've been watching my DVD over and over since I got it a few weeks ago, and I just love it.  Now I am reading the book, which I bought used through amazon.  The book is also terrific.  It fills in details that, of course, they didn't have time to include in the miniseries.

This is the story of how obsessive mother Helena disrupts the lives of her son, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, ex-husband and his new family, as they all participate in a grand conspiracy to hide that the son has regular contact with his father.  They think she is suicidal. What they don't know is that Helena is more likely to murder.  She has killed before and will kill again.

Diana Rigg has the juicy part of Helena, which she plays to perfection.  The other actors play their roles perfectly.  James Wilby is excellent as Kit, the son who is torn between protecting his fragile (he thinks) mother and being honest with his little girls.  Isla Blair as Kit's stepmother is memorable and likeable.  Even the little girls playing Kit's daughters are good little actresses.  I'm thinking of the scene where ""Lollipop"" indignantly telss Grandma Helena that bratty Olivia, ""pushed Mary down the stairs on PURPOSE!""

Watching this movie makes me speculate about questions.  What if Kit stood up to his mother?  Why didn't Alex try to get custody of Kit when he was a child?  Why would Alex and Ruth go along with the conspiracy to protect Helena?  Did Helena have a plan to hide her guilt in the last murder that failed, sort of?  Would Kit really have turned out so normal with a mother like that?  I could go on and on.",1240272000,4,2058,4.514905149051491
2750031,5,B000MV8H3Y,"I saw this mystery series only once, when it was originally broadcast in the US in 1989 and I have thought about it ever since. The scene where David McCallum's current wife suffocates to death in her studio haunted me for years.",1236384000,6,229,4.476190476190476
2750032,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Everyone else on this site is absolutely correct. This show was just brilliant! Rarely could a TV show capture an adult audience with the type of rapt attention over three episodes the way this one could. It was just rivetting. It is 20 years since I saw it, and I can so vividly recall everything about it: the electrifying performance of Diana Rigg, the twists and turns in the plot...the marzipan. Who could forget the marzipan?!

When will it be released on DVD? We have waited for 20 years. We've been patient. But the world needs to see this again. And again.",1234828800,6,565,4.53921568627451
2750033,5,B000MV8H3Y,"Diana Rigg is delightfully chilling as mad Mommie Helena Vesey.  Dumped years ago by her conductor husband because of her clinging ways, she has her boy Kit (her ""Kitten"", ew) to drum her hatred of Lord Vesey into.  But Kit meets Angela and wants to marry.  Helena decides it's best to welcome her.  But Angela has a hard time keeping Kit's secret: that against Helena's express wishes and without her knowledge, Kit sees his father and his new family.  Something that Helena would consider the worst sort of betrayal.  It's disloyal, and according to Helena, disloyalty is the worst sin, and one that deserves the harshest punishment.  Sadly for Helena, so many are disloyal..

Shown on American Television 18 years ago, this is the blackest of comedies.  All of the cast is fine, but of course Diana Rigg tears up the screen as Helena.  This soooo needs to be released on DVD, email the BBC and demand it be released!",1231113600,12,919,4.6875

To:  BBC Television

The BBC produced a classic in 1989's Mother Love: part psychological drama and part black comedy. Diana Rigg is compelling as the woman scorned, as she slowly reveals the depths of her character's madness. Possessiveness and revenge were never played so good. Dame Diana received a BAFTA award and many critical praises on both sides of the Atlantic. There has been a very rare repeat of this unforgettable series on television. Dame Diana and David McCallum have many fans across the globe who would love to see Mother Love again or for the first time. We petition the BBC to produce the definitive, uncut DVD release, with digitally remastered sound & picture, interviews made for the series, and all of the advertisements, posters, behind-the-scenes, bloopers and anything else related to it. Commentary by Dame Diana, David McCallum and other actors associated with the series would be fantastic. Every day on auction sites such as ebay bootleg copies are being sold for princley sums. Many of us want a real copy, so, BBC let us pay you the money, - so, please, please release it. Thank you.

I recently purchased it from that site.  Delivery was prompt and the price was pretty good.  the recording itself is an OK transfer from a slightly grainy but otherwise clean videotape.

I hadn't seen this since it first aired nearly 3 decades ago.  I'd always had VERY good memories of it.  Watching it again, I'm afraid the reality didn't match the memory for me.  It IS a pretty chilling tale and Diana Rigg is suitability creepy (if a bit over-the-top) in the main role but, in general, most of  the acting ranges from mediocre to average (it's so consistently sub-par that I think the director is more to blame than the actors).  As for the screenplay, it's no stranger to awkward jumps and unresolved details and it doesn't really provide adequate depth to the characters (except maybe Diana Rigg 's Helena although even she could have been fleshed out a bit more).  Still, even if this does put a bit of a tarnish on my memory of the show, I'm very glad to have found a recording of it after so many years.",1470614400,2,1258,4.426086956521739
