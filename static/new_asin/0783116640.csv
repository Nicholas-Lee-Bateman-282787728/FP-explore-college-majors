50575,5,0783116640,"This is the most precious bedtime video I've seen.  My two year old twins love it, and the grown-ups never tire of watching it, either.  The animation is terrific, the children's vignettes are both funny and heartwarming, and the music selection is fabulous.  I'm buying more of them to give as gifts!",981244800,2,301,4.75
50576,5,0783116640,"My daughter and I make a point of avoiding the ""TV"" during daylight hours (when we can ?)  Goodnight Moon has been a bedtime ritual in book form since her birth in June `99.  Since she got her Goodnight Moon video this Christmas, I have had to review our ""TV"" regulations.  She is captivated by the story Goodnight Moon in its video format but has related to so many of the stories from the other children featured in the film, that she seems to have stepped up in her understanding of ""things"" !  ""When Mummy comes home we play and have dinner and then I get my bottle  and sit with Mum and Dad and watch and sing and listen to my tape MOOM MOOM ! It`s great !!""",980899200,3,663,4.108527131782946
50577,5,0783116640,"My 19 month old daughter received this video for Christmas, and not one day goes by that we do not watch it at least once before bedtime!  If she is being extra whiny or wound up, we pop this video in, and she is quiet and laughing and amazingly enough, still...for the whole 20 something minutes...it is like magic!  The well known songs are so creatively done! The imagery is a work of art for a child as well as an adult. She loves the kids  as do we all!  Just starting the video has her clapping her hands and saying YAY!!  She is speaking more and more since she started watching this video and makes all the motions with the bears stretching and yawning and the old lady whispering hush!!  I cannot recommend it highly enough!!  Order it, just order it...trust me.  And if anyone knows of any video even slightly similar to this one...please, please tell me!!",980467200,5,866,4.40251572327044
50578,5,0783116640,"Good Night Moon is a charming video - the animation and music is so delightful.  My 2.5 year old daughter cannot get enough of this video - Susan Sarandon is such an effective narrator - I can't even get enough of this video.  Tar Beach with Natalie Cole is beautiful and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star with Pattie LaBelle has such sweet animation.  Aaron Neville sings Lullaby and warms our hearts.  I am so happy that I came across this video - the children are absolutely charming and make us laugh with their innocence and honesty.  This is definitely a video you want your children to see (and you, too!)",978998400,8,606,4.522935779816514

50614,5,0783116640,"This is a fantastic piece of animation and children interviews combined using classic children's literature.  Funny and at points sad, with an amazing telling of Goodnight Mood as the center piece.

50636,5,0783116640,A number of my children (at least 3) have loved this movie with it's cute quiet time message.  Goodnight Moon is one of my favorite classic stories and I am glad my children have followed suit.  This short video has Susan Sarandon narrating the story and she does a perfect job.  Other big names narrate other bed time stories and kids are interviewed with adorable points of view between story tellings. Fun for little ones (and mom too).,1464307200,,439,4.602564102564102
50637,1,0783116640,"They have taken a wonderful book and put it in an awful video. In between the stories, none of them as lovely as Good Night Moon there are kids talking about monsters and nightmares. We didn't make it through 15 minutes before I had a scared 4 year old begging me to shut it off.

50663,1,0783116640,"I have loved other HBO products for children (poetry show, the music show, etc.) and thought I would love this, but I didn't!!!  :(  One of the segments deals with the death of loved ones and how they return to their family members in their dreams.  In that segment, it even had a a child talking about the death of his father.  What a terribly mature subject to include in a children's film before bedtime.  My son who is a particularly worrisome stage of childhood was traumatized!  Perhaps, less important there was a segment on the role of dream catchers, which I found to have a spiritual element to the show that I wished wasn't there!  I wish they would've stuck with reading great children's literature about bedtime.  :(  We've watched it once and will not be watching it again, but I don't feel comfortable passing it along to a friend because of the troublesome content.",1426204800,3,881,4.596153846153846

Sometimes, they prefer to skip over parts, but the parts that I love are Goodnight Moon and at the end, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  We started watching at about 2 and one half years for the kids.

I will never tire of this DVD. Love ours so much just ordered one for my best friends little ones first birthday along with a plush bunny (:))  Also, the negative reviews seem to be upset over the story 'a nightmare in my closet' which is another classic!!! the pictures are directly from that story and it is a story about how the nightmare was NOT scary at all once the boy was brave enough to confront it.  Other complaints about the sweet children talking about how loved ones can stay with us in our hearts through our dreams after they pass....I find that very touching and beautiful and inspiring!!! From the mouths of babes....Cant please some people.",1402012800,4,957,4.793939393939394

After one night, he called to tell me (overwhelmed with joy) that the video worked!  It was so soothing and calming.  From the narration to the music, from beginning to end it was great.

50820,2,0783116640,"My 2.5 year old gets hyperactive when he gets tired so I bought some videos which I hoped would be soothing and calming. This one fails. First there are interviews with real kids, then a story, then another section of kids talking, and so on throughout the DVD. Don't get me wrong, the kids are sweet as can be, but the topics are not what a child needs to listen to when you are trying to get them to sleep. Much of the kids discussions are about bad dreams and nightmares, deceased family members in your head and dreams, and a bunch of other stuff that the target age for this video are too young to deal with, particularly at bedtime. These topics are more suited to actual parent-child discussion based on individual circumstances. And why would I want discussions of nightmares right before getting a child ready to sleep? The last little story is quite soothing and you can imagine your little one's eyes closing. But then, more kids talking about real life issues in everyday voices. The intrusion of real kids between bedtime stories is just plain jarring. If your child begins to fall asleep, they will surely wake right up again each time these kids come on. The actual stories are decent but not great, therefore the detractions of these kid interviews are just plain irritating, and I will not be showing it to my little guy. I wish I had listened to the reviewers who talked about the distraction/inappropriateness of children discussing nightmares and monsters in a video of bedtime stories. Do yourself a favour and get the book and a different video.",1374710400,4,1567,4.6606498194945845

Also, the length of ~25 minutes is perfect. Long enough for her to see before going to bed. Other videos like Sesame Street run an hour.
There is also a soundtrack in Spanish that we use for our daughter.  It's pretty good [pochean a veces, por ejemplo ""es una cosa nativamericana"" - o sea, una artesania tipica de los indigenas de america del norte].
Overall, highly, highly recommended!
P.S. - these videos are enjoyable to watch as an adult as well.  The songs from Goodnight Moon by Aaron Neville, Patti LaBelle and Tony Bennett are beautiful.

50931,5,0783116640,"I was shocked when I discovered that people did not like this video for ridiculous reasons. Please see below:

1. Children cannot sit still for the elementary school kids' interviews. My early-toddler kid was fine. If a kid gets up from the sofa during these one to three minute(s) interviews and interludes, something is wrong. If you have one of those said kids, just get your foward-trigger finger ready. (I used to fast-foward the puppet scenes in my daughter's ""Caillou"" videos when she complained; I now tell her ""tough luck"".)

2. ""A Nightmare in My Closet"" causes nightmares. If you, as an adult, cannot pick up on the humor and lightheartedness in this story, there's a problem. Anything can cause a nightmare- big birds, pink milk, Barney. Loosen up, cause kids will eventually be exposed to the ""monsters-in-the-closet"" deal through general kid culture, and because you have no control over it.

3. Kids in the interviews/interludes are ""pretentious"".  I think that the producers just had incredible luck in getting interesting kids with personalities across the board. It seems to me that they just went to a local elementary school, rounded up some rats, got a few kids related to peeps that were workin' on this movie, and then got to work. Hey, ya got your dramatic kids, your deep kids, the giggly ones, and my fave, the comic ones. Know this- kids do not always have the personality of a robotic-perky child starring in a commercial. If an adult thinks that they are pretentious, that worries me- for both the adult, and said adult's child. Please, how the heck can a girl leading her blind twin around be pretentious?!

4. It is terrible that one child mentions that he dreamed of his deceased father. Um, is this reviewer related to Stalin?

5. Story content, soundtrack, and color is terrible; movie is a choppy presentation without universal appeal. I disagree. All presented stories are related to sleepy-time, soundtrack does not thankfully have Britney Spears, color and presentation is perfectly fine. This movie will not have universal appeal due to viewing adults or children who are insomniacs.

6. The interviews are presented abruptly between the animation segments. Probably...some terrific book on consumerism aimed at kids mentioned that ""Sesame Street"" segments were found in studies to not transition well either, at least for kids of that age group (twoish to fourish). Whatta ya gonna do- that's how moving images are presented, and we can't rewire brains. I hope that neither ""GM"" or ""SS"" causes post traumatic stress syndrome in our kids.

7. Toy sword was assigned to the boy in ""Nightmare in My Closet"", as opposed to the popgun in the book version. Come on, we know why. And if you are a librarian complaining about this fact, can't you just get the book through interlibrary loan? (Note: Please see two-star reviews.)

Basically, you are getting animated tales (""Goodnight Moon"", ""Nightmare in My Closet"", and ""Tar Beach""), animated songs by Tony Bennett, Lauryn Hill, Aaron Neville, and Patti LaBelle, and the segments with kids (not all segments with kids are interviews- one little girl is shown picking flowers and presents her song, while others are making a dream-catcher, etc.). Good addition to your collection of calming nighttime movies. Just skip the popcorn.",1319241600,5,3313,5.020036429872495

It's so interesting seeing the comments about the ""New York-ness"" of the video because, boy yeah, I thought the exact same thing! I was really struck by how ""Northeast/urban"" the focus seemed. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course, but it just struck me.

Regarding the New York-centric comment from one reviewer, I never even noticed this, really, & I'm from TN/NC/VA; a number of the kids interviewed are actually from Durham, NC.

What the kids have to say is almost always sweet and insightful (there is one precocious girl featured in one segment who seems to know/think that what she's saying is really deep, but apart from her, these kids are all beautifully honest and innocently wise).

I understand some of the parents not liking the kids talking as much as the stories, but if your kids are used to that format (mine were through Sesame Street videos) then they won't mind a bit. Every child is different, so some will love it and some won't. As for the kids being ""very New Yorky""- yes, they are, but why is that so horrible? I like exposing my kids to kids from different places, and once again, if they watch Sesame Street videos, they'll already be used to kids from New York. The only criticism I have is that it goes into some very heavy issues- one little boy talks about his mommy dreaming about his dad who died. That's a pretty serious topic for bedtime. I'd prefer that they didn't do that, but my kids don't seem to be badly affected by it.",1217376000,,1090,4.195238095238095

It is too New York-centric, e.g. Tar Beach, references to Scarsdale.  The children featured are not very endearing.  There are a couple of pale unsmiling girls, some of them talk like adults with a glassy stare.  They come across as city kids with city attitude.  The 'hush little baby' song is too urbanized.
And the Tar Beach story, I don't understand why it's so popular.  The actual beach is 1 hour away by subway, much more pleasant than hanging out on a NYC rooftop and pretending it's a beach.  And the empowerment message is silly.
It's an OK video if you like NYC so much that you want it represented on your Good Night Moon video.

I was concerned that our child would be frightened by the Mercer Nightmare story, but she finds the scene of the Nightmare character crying to be funny (so much for empathy).

When my daughter sees the other children on TV, she is VERY interested in them.  So interested that she sits straight up (almost like she's thinking, ""Ooh!  Big kids!"") and we lose all of the progress we've made toward sleepytime.  I'll give this DVD another shot when she's a little older.

51122,5,0783116640,"We loved the Classical baby DVD's so much that we searched for other DVD's put out by Amy Schatz and HBO and found this DVD.  The Goodnight Moon story is beautifully told.  Susan Sarandon's voice is so calming and the music chosen for the story is such a perfect pairing.  The little kids snippets which are layered between the bedtime stories or musical pieces are cute and not too disruptive, though I would probably enjoy the DVD all the more if they weren't there in exchange for more music or another story.  Wisely, the DVD is authored to allow for skipping past these *slices of life stories* to go straight to the music or bedtime story parts of the DVD.  Our baby loves it too and is quite engaged by the art, music and overall calmness of the DVD!",1142380800,2,757,4.41726618705036
51123,5,0783116640,"We got this movie from our local library when my daughter was one year old and my son three. Both children (and both of their parents) were enchanted throughout. We renewed the movie for over a month because our children loved it so much! Our kids loved the interviews as much as the animated portions, and the video introduced us to books (like Mercer Mayers ""monster"" series and the poignant ""Tar Beach"") that are now favorites here. I hope to buy this for our family and look forward to the discussions it will generate as our children grow.",1141516800,2,544,4.561224489795919
51124,5,0783116640,"My girls love this DVD. I have put them to bed by reciting Goodnight Moon their entire lives and seeing it on the ""big screen"" was both exciting and comforting. The other stories are also wonderful and I am glad to have my children hear them. Susan Sarandon's voice is calming and melodic. It uses the original illustrations from the books (not animated) which are beautiful.

My only complaint is that it is a very New York movie with the children who are interviewed obviously New York centered. One child mentions Scarsdale which promted a lot of questions. I wish it had been more location neutral, actually I could have done without the children interviews at all, but the girls don't mind them. In fact, they laugh at the kids jokes and it has sparked very in depth conversations about topics (like death, poverty, and handicaps) that I probably would have avoided for a few more years.

I have found that this is a excellent DVD for the car. It is both calming and engaging. I don't mind listening to it. All in all it is really great.",1136073600,24,1042,4.537234042553192

(Told in their own sweet little raspy and funny voices)  My 2 and 4 year old love this and it has become our bedtime routine.  It also opens up dialogue such as why do we dream, what is a lullaby and even who were the BEATLES.!  (a girl dreams she meets the beatles).

It is a relaxing video with some adorable interviews with children.  At one point children talk about dreams.  My three year old really likes that part and it prompted her to tell me about a nightmare she had recently about a bear.  It seemed that she could relate to the children talking about their own dreams and nightmares.

In between the stories there are short segements showing some really, really cute kids saying and doing really, really cute stuff. One is boy who talks insightfully to his sister about what it is like being blind (""I can't imagine seeing with little sparks shooting out of your eyes""), another is a girl who wrote and sings her own lulaby (""My grandma always says it, so I added it to the end of _my_ lulaby"").

We've watched this at least 50 times and still love every second. It is about as good as childrens' video can get.

51191,2,0783116640,"I was looking SO forward to getting this video for my 20-month old, because he adores his ""moon"" book (the Goodnight Moon book).  We read it almost every single night.  And since we sometimes watch a video before we go to bed, I thought the Goodnight Moon video would be perfect.  The ""Goodnight Moon"" portion was excellect, very sweet, very calming.  And, I will say much of the other parts were nice too.  But the ""Nightmare in my Closet"" story was the kicker.  It talks of a little boy and this monster in his closet, that is ugly, tall and then comes into his bed with the little boy.  Yes, the monster is friendly, but the images of a monster, period, before a little one goes to sleep could be disturbing.  Now, my toddler is too young to speak of monsters, bad dreams, or scary things, but I'm afraid this story could make him start having bad dreams and get scared at an early age.  Overall, not a very pleasing bedtime choice.  Now I have decided I will just fast forward through that story in the video, or, simply just stick to READING our favorite book!!",1029369600,23,1066,4.392857142857143
51212,3,0783116640,"Caution to parents of children who are afraid of the dark.  My 4 year old Daughter watched this movie --- until the closet monster scene came on.  It went something like this...a boy in his bed with the covers up to his eyes, the wind howling the curtains and window shutters blowing back and forth and the closet door slowly creeping open.  Finally a towering monster like character starts moving towards the boy in the bed. That is all my Daughter had to see! It scared her so badly she had nightmares for a couple of years.  The scene ended up where the monster was actually afraid of the boy and it cried on the floor but the build up to that could be frightening to a young child.  Overall the movie isn't bad at all it was just that one scene that scared her so now that she's in her 20's I am giving this movie an edited rating of 3 stars ""its okay"".  I hated it back when she was 4 due to all the interrupted sleep it caused in our house but if you are buying it for your little one I would just suggest you watch it first so you are not caught off guard.",1017792000,27,1063,4.062200956937799

I LOVED this tape!  The ""interviews"" about love, life, sleeping, romance etc with the children inbetween the animation is wise and amusing and priceless! The narration is calming and poised, and by the end of the tape, I wanted to go to sleep too--having felt like this classic story had just been read to me personally.  who needs therapy?  this video is as soulful and delightful for grownups as well as children.
