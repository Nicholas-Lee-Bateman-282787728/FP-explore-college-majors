8058880,4,B0009AK4UC,"I've had the movie poster for this flick since college - my day as a sorority girl.  Altho my experience was nothing like the movie, this movie was just as entertaining.  Enjoyed it -campy B movie as I expected.  It was VHS, sealed - appeared to have never been viewed.  The seller was prompt in delivery, product as they had advertised.  Would buy from them again.",1271462400,,365,4.46969696969697
8058881,3,B0009AK4UC,"The tape was in great shape and was delivered as promised.

The movie was just so-so,I guess typical of the low-budget B movies of that era. I bought it as i like seeing obscure actors in various roles,I find it interesting. June Kenney was one of those.",1243900800,,254,4.404255319148936
8058882,5,B0009AK4UC,"For those Corman freaks out there, this film marks the first teaming of Corman regulars Susan Cabot and Barboura Morris (later to be teamed in The Wasp Woman), and the film debut of Ms. Morris, with whom Corman was a student in a Jeff Corey acting class. The two beauties make a solid team in this low-budgeter, an ""expose"" of sorority girls (what else) at an unnamed college/university in Southern California. (Some of the exteriors appear to be shot at the UCLA or USC campus.)

Susan Cabot plays (very convincingly, in an excellent performance) Sabra, who narrates the story, a spoiled, pretty rich girl who belongs to what must be the top sorority on campus, and who resorts to such everyday university doings as blackmail, manipulation, attempted boyfriend stealing, backstabbing, and sadistic spankings, all due to unidentified psychological problems and longing for love from a Mommie Dearest mother who couldn't care less.

She drives a gorgeous '57 Thunderbird and can't understand why the other girls don't like her. We soon grow to wonder why the other sorority members can't see what she's like, though that comes in time.

Barboura Morris (billed here as Barboura O'Neill), unique, lovely, and convincing as always, plays Rita, another sorority member who is an early feminist, involved in campus politics and issues such as equal treatment for women and educational standards. She fits the role like a glove, giving a natural, believable performance. One wouldn't guess this was her first movie role.

Rita is also the girlfriend of the awesome Corman actor-of-all-types Dick Miller (playing Morty, who runs the local beer hangout). He is worldly-wise and cynical, unlike Rita (Morris and Miller would be memorably teamed two years later in the Corman cult classic A Bucket of Blood.) In short order, Sabra is blackmailing both of them, Rita because her father is in prison and no one knows, Morty on a trumped-up charge of causing another sorority girl's pregnancy. (In the middle of all this, she even makes a play for Morty, but it's an incomplete pass.)

Just the usual campus hi-jinks circa 1957, right? Well, when the truth is finally revealed, the sorority en masse turns on Sabra while at a sorority beach picnic, led by the outraged Rita (delightfully slender, leggy Barboura in a one-piece bathing suit). Sabra then appears to come to a mysterious end (although, since she is narrating the film, she doesn't die--or does she?)

All in all, a fun low-budgeter to watch when you're in the mood for 1950s exploitation melodrama. This brisk, hour-long ""B"" is more fun to watch than a lot of big-budget ""A"" flicks from the same era with the same kind of subject material (which take themselves much more seriously). It is directed with vigor and a sure hand by Corman, who makes the most of the very sparse sets with careful camera angles and lighting, and keeps the story going so we don't want to hit the Pause button and go get a snack.

Check it out!",1239840000,2,2973,4.898608349900597
8058883,4,B0009AK4UC,"Three years before she found her greatest fame playing the title role in Roger Corman's ""The Wasp Woman"", Susan Cabot played the unhinged, sociopathic Sabra Tanner in SORORITY GIRL, Corman's unusal psychological drama from 1957.

Filmed on the USC Campus and utilising the real sorority houses, Roger Corman injects the movie with a hard-edged realism which is completely at odds with the other low-budget quickie films that he was helming for American International Pictures (AIP).

The odd girl out in her sorority, teen bitch Sabra Tanner (Susan Cabot) spends her days manipulating and torturing poor pledge Ellie (Barbara Crane)--going so far as to paddle her with the sorority bat!  She blackmails would-be class president Rita (Barboura Morris) by threatening to reveal that her father has been in jail; and later uses--gasp--pregnant Tina (June Kenney) in an extortion plan to seduce Rita's boyfriend Mort (Dick Miller).

The entire movie only runs for sixty minutes, but within that brisk hour there's a ton of blackmail, bitchery and backstabbing, indeed so much that it's guaranteed to have your shaking your head in astonishment!  Susan Cabot, in my opinion the greatest and most talented actress of the 1960s B-movies, gives the role of monstrous Sabra everything she can muster; you'll be amazed by her performance.  A shining talent taken from us too soon.  And it's fun seeing Cabot and Barboura Morris together here (Morris plays the dimwit secretary in ""The Wasp Woman"" with Cabot).

Definitely a noteworthy title for serious B-movie fans.",1219708800,,1556,5.245967741935484
