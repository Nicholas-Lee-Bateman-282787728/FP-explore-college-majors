His trials and tribulations are plenty, but his family steadfastly supports him throughout.  During the course of his journey to reach the top, his path crosses those of the audio cassette shop owner, Manivannan; Jayaganesh's youthful and bubbly daughter, Jothika; Jayaganesh, a concerned father who eventually questions Ajeeth's credibility and his goals and even minute characters like the head-strong music director Hanifa, who squints his eyes at Ajeeth with anger and disbelief.  His brother, Raghuvaran along with his family which includes his wife Sitara, a younger sister and father, love & support his urge to accomplish something substantial in his life.
