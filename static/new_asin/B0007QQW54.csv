2231586,3,B0007QQW54,"First thing people should know is that Cohn does not ""kick"" the bass on pedals, so you will not learn about this.  Also he is not the best player, in fact quite a few local players I know are better than him.  Cohn's Right hand is slow and stiff, no real great or fast left hand runs.

I did learn a few good things about the presets and the drawbars, but he only spends the first 10 minutes talking about the organ, the rest is on his playing and there wasn't much he could show me, I copied one bass line, but it would be good for beginner to ameteur, but you have to know what 7ths and 9ths are and how chord inversions work. I wanted more on chord voicings for organ as most of my piano voicings are too fat. Basically, I thought it was worth watching  as it costs as much as a lesson.",1180569600,6,789,4.006369426751593
2231587,3,B0007QQW54,"Let's just say that the description on the cover of this video is exaggerating a bit when it says ""Learn to get the thrilling organ sounds that have enhanced blues, jazz, gospel and rock and roll throughout the history of popular music.""
For starters, Cohen doesn't come off as that great of an organ player.  His sense of rhythm is a bit klutzy, and he doesn't really get that great a sound out of his B3.  This isn't helped by the production sound - Cohen's voice is clear as a bell, but the B3 sounds distant.  What you do hear is a lot of the noise of the keys being pressed, which interferes with the viewer's perception of the organ sound.  The solos are OK, nothing exciting - be warned that they do assume a certain amount of knowledge of basic chords on the part of the viewer.  I also expected more tips, tricks, and secrets of the masters, although there are one or two.  He shows you what the drawbars do, but except for a fadeout at the end of one tune, he never manipulates them during a solo.  Pedals are not covered, and although he plays bass lines with his left hand, he never discusses how to get a good bass sound.  He gives the expression pedal the briefest of mentions, whereas its control is an important technique.
If you're completely new to the organ with a bit of keyboard theory under your belt, you may find this video beneficial.",1042848000,10,1359,4.365079365079365

8050542,4,B0007QQW54,"Very helpful. It's basic stuff, no doubt about that; however I've been playing Hammond Organ for 30 years now and Cohen's instruction helps me. It's a good, step-by-step about the organ itself. He's amusing and pleasant to listen to.",1488067200,,233,5.0

8050546,4,B0007QQW54,"I am a part time musician (Church Keyboard / Synth Player)
I play music in one of the biggest churches in North California.

I was on Synth and had a opportunity to play on the B3 Organ.

Thanks to this DVD. It helped me to utilize the oppurtunity.

The first few chapters, the steps to turn on the B3 and the Leslie Amp, is beautifully explained.

Will highly recommend it to any one who is starting on the Hammond B3 Organ or has an interest to play on the Hammond B3 Organ.",1400457600,,476,4.141304347826087
8050547,5,B0007QQW54,"David Cohen is very good teacher I have to say, maybe he is not the most advanced player
but that not the point. Ability to teach anybody can understand easily is a gift, many great players
have no idea how to do this and you would not get anything from them. I am advanced piano player
and wanted to get some basic coverage of hammond organ playing. This DVD does the job perfectly.
You'll get the fundamentals plus intermediate skills here and you can get crazy from there on you own.",1362700800,,486,4.351648351648351
8050548,2,B0007QQW54,"What can I add, most of the other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. This man does not come accross as a real player's player. He does not show or share great chops, or teach great licks and answer long asked questions. I imagine a beginner would find a lot to learn here.",1312416000,,278,4.072727272727272
8050549,4,B0007QQW54,"I don't know why people be hating on this DVD so much, it's really not bad. If you are like me (intermediate amateur, mostly play for self and with friends) and you are trying to teach yourself how to play a Hammond organ clone (recently got a Nord Electro) this DVD will give you a bunch of stuff to practice.  And, let's face it, that's what's going to make you better; practice, practice, practice. And this DVD has lots of things to work on.  The DVD also comes with a 20 page booklet of transcriptions of the tunes played on it, which is very helpful.

Cohen spends the first 10 minutes just showing how all the drawbars, presets, and odd twiddly knobs on a Hammond work. Then he plays 5-6 different songs (slow, fast, blues-y, funk-y), spending about 10 minutes on each one to show bass lines (mostly pretty simple) and break down solos. Each song is also played as a part of a quartet.  Not a bad format for a lesson.

Cohen spends a lot of the playing time analyzing his solos, almost note by note, and what chord variations they are drawn from. All the starting and stopping and chord naming does get a little tedious at times.  But you get a lot of music for your $20 (including shipping, from various resellers). And the point is, there are no magic shortcuts to learning how to play any instrument well, you have to just keep playing and challenging yourself and learning.  For many people like me, I think, this DVD will give your fingers and brain a workout as you try to channel your inner Booker T./Al Kooper/Lee Michaels/insert favorite organ player's name here...",1292544000,8,1581,4.506993006993007
8050550,1,B0007QQW54,"I agree with the reviewers that say this DVD is not that great.  Cohen is a very stiff player and the things he shows you would only impress beginners who had no knowledge of chords.
He also assumes you know music theory , which many do not.  If you play worst that Cohen, this DVD will not help you.  Most players are much better than he is and have more feeling in their playing. Not to mention his predictable solos.
One star because he does explain the drawbars , but he doesn't show how to use them in performance.  I've learned more watching real Hammond players, who would probably make a better video.  Cohen is probably not a real Hammond player.  This video will not make you one either.  Save your money.",1218326400,4,715,4.371212121212121
