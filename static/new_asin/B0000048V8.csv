1183942,5,B0000048V8,"My 2 year has never been one for videos, but he has been enthralled with this since his first viewing.  We get to share a special time since he feels the best place from which to watch is my lap.  And although the  ending is sad, it is tastefully done and helps children understand that  magic only lasts for a little while, but is special while it is there.  This will definitely be a tradition at our house.",915062400,,409,4.1923076923076925

1183944,5,B0000048V8,This video affected both me and my two-year-old daughter.  The artwork is simple and the music is beautiful.  The best part is its pace.  It is not at all like the high-energy whizzing by your face non-stop action of most  children's animation.  It is gentle without becoming boring.  It is a real  delight. My one tongue-in-cheek criticism is that it could encourage  frostbite (the kid runs around in his pajamas!) Otherwise this is a must  for any child or adult.,912729600,,466,4.725
1183945,5,B0000048V8,"This is one of the gentlest, most beautiful movies for any age that I have seen.  I love it as much as my four year old.  The music, drawing and story are soft, warm and deeply moving.  The grownups cried and our son was  transfixed.  It is simple but can be seen again and again.  Not to be  missed.  There is some Christmas-related material, but it is incidental so  the film can be said to be nonsectarian.  A gem.",911779200,,417,4.1645569620253164

1183960,2,B0000048V8,"I love this film and I've watched it probably 50 times with my kids over the years. I have every scene memorized. I own both the DVD and the Blu-ray version, and I'm extremely disappointed by the Blu-ray version for 2 reasons:

1) It does not include the original introduction by Raymond Briggs. I love hearing him recite: ""I remember that winter because it had brought the heaviest snow I had ever seen. Snow had fallen steadily all night long and in the morning I woke in a room filled with light and silence, the whole world seemed to be held in a dream-like stillness. It was a magical day... and it was on that day I made the Snowman.""

2) On the Blu-ray version, the entire top and bottom of every scene are cropped away to make the original square 4:3 presentation fill the rectangular 16:9 shape of HDTVs. Once you notice that the tops and bottoms of scenes are missing, you can't un-see it. You can't help but notice when heads cut out of scenes, and other details are missing.

I only watch the DVD version because I want to see the entirety of every scene as it was originally created and framed. I highly recommend getting the DVD version instead. It doesn't fill the entire width of your HDTV, but it's not supposed to. Enjoy the movie in the original format, with bars along the side and every other perfect imperfection.",1514073600,4,1335,4.463114754098361

1183990,5,B0000048V8,"This was an animation I grew up watching. My mother taped it off TV when I was a kid and I've watched it every holiday season since as long as I can remember. I even had the stuffed Snowman doll for years! The interesting thing is, I never realized that David Bowie did an introduction to this story! I'm American and I grew up with the original British release, with the authors introduction. I personally still like the original better, but I'm glad this DVD includes the David Bowie intro as a special feature-- because, come on, it's still David Bowie! I also like the featurette that shows the popularity of both the book and the animation, as well as its creation. I grew up thinking that not many people were familiar with it, when really it was an international sensation! But again, I'm American and I don't think as many people here really know it. Anyway, it's one of a few holiday classics that really endears to me and tugs at my heart strings. It is a wonderful classic that I hope to show to my kids one day, as it was shown to me.",1486944000,,1046,4.341836734693878

Many reviewers have expressed an appreciation for the song ""Walking in the Air.""  If you like that song, do yourself a favor and check out the rendition of the song found on Kenny Loggins' album ""December.""  [It can be heard at [...] .]  Kenny's recording has much higher production values and an altogether more lush accompaniment; moreover, for many his voice is more ""accessible"" than the boy soprano who sings on The Snowman.  In fact, the entire ""December"" album is outstanding -- especially the title track.  If your sensibilities draw you to The Snowman, you'll love ""December.""

He recently learned how to put the mouthpiece on his papa's French horn and can hold a key and blow through the 26 feet of tubing, making a wonderful sound. I was on Skype with him while he was watching The Snowman, and he could pick out the French horn part at the beginning of the movie. He laughs and talks about what's happening, just enjoying the wonder of the story and the imagination he's experiencing and developing in his own right. My son remembers watching it when he was young, too. So, they watch it together..the whole family is enjoying it.

1184114,5,B0000048V8,"This wonderful story is part of our family Traditiion. Like ""the Bear"" and the cartoon graphic novel
(which my grandson loves reading on his own), this animation is a fantastic escape for the whole clan.
Definitely it's a warm fuzzy !

Caution: be sure to watch it on an external DVD player as it is
registered in Region 2 not the US (Region 1) and can freeze your computer's DVD drive
if viewed 5 times. Unfortunately the selection for region window is invasive and before I
could decline  it selected for me, as it were. I can no longer watch dvd's on
my laptop and it will cost me 100 to fix the problem. HOWEVER, if you just
dont play it on a US/ Region 1  laptop, you're fine.

I love the music so much, the flying scene is a great escape fantasy, even for 'grown ups'.
Thanks for this great animation with a positive and heart opening message. There is so much junk
and violence young people are subjected to, the Snowman is a definite reassertion of light and goodness.",1425254400,3,976,4.375690607734807

The wiggly animation style captures the feeling of the original picture book and the fact that it has no dialogue really makes a toddler pay attention to understand what's going on.  Plus it has a wonderful, memorable score.

I was worried that this DVD would not play on my region 1 US DVD player, but happily it did.  The movie played in wide screen.  It had the David Bowie alternate intro as a special feature, but not the lovely duet with Bing Crosby that I remember.  It also had a behind the scenes special that is as long as the original film.

I was a little surprised at watching a movei without words, intended for children.  I have read the book, in the past, with my son and it did not keep his attention at all. So, I was not sure how the movie would go.

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie!  It has wonderful music that goes along with the story, and is so well done you barely recognize there are no words being said.  The story plays out wonderfully, and includes the boy and a snowman and their adventure.  It is great for the holidays, great for winter and seriously captivating.  My kids, ages 4 and 7, like this movie and watched it several times.  They love the story and the music.  It is such a touching story that keeps their attention.  I think they are also drawn to the snow since we do not have snow where we live :)

This movie would make a great holiday gift, and one to add to your holiday collection .  I don't think anyone outgrows a story about a snowman coming to life-it touches grownups and children's hearts.  Beautiful.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Christmas wouldnt be the same without another showing for the heart-melting fantasy about a boy whose snowman creation magically comes to life. The original OSCAR nominated THE SNOWMAN, famed for the scene of the boy and his snowman taking flight to the swelling choral ballad ""Walking in the Air"" has been screened every Christmas by Channel 4 Television in the UK since 1982.

The tale of THE SNOWMAN follows the story of a young boy on one winter's day, as he decides that he wants to build a snowman. After much effort put into building his frosty creation, at the stroke of midnight whilst the young boy is fast asleep, the snowman suddenly springs to life. We then follow the snowman whilst accompanied by the young boy, as they impart on a magical wondering which leads them on a journey all the way to the North Pole to meet Santa Claus.

Dianne Jackson's and Jimmy T. Murakami's masterful direction of THE SNOWMAN would struggle if it had tried to be more of a thriving example of an adaptation done right. Within being obviously robbed of its 1983 Oscar for best animated short, THE SNOWMAN is still an incredibly underrated Christmas special that could not be more faithfully adapted from its original source that is Raymond Brigg's original 1978 classic story book. THE SNOWMAN also features the unquestionable talent of David Bowie and Raymond Briggs, depending on the UK or US release, as the older version of the young boy and as the narrator before the story begins.

The most obvious highlight of THE SNOWMAN is easily it's hauntingly beautiful use of sound and animation. From the jaw dropping voice of angelic St Pauls Cathedral choir boy Peter Auty, and featuring an incredible orchestral score by the Sinfonia of London; Walking in the Air is a dazzling piece that is almost guaranteed to stay with you throughout the film, and long after the final credits roll. I will not lie to you and say that THE SNOWMAN is an entirely happy concoction, however despite it's somewhat melancholy ending, this story still stands out to be a must see Christmas classic, for even those who are usually only loyal to their happy go lucky cinematic fiction.

Although, THE SNOWMAN is undoubtedly heart-warming, the film doesnt sugar-coat the sad ending as the life of THE SNOWMAN is shown to be all too short and fleeting. It is testament to this respectful and sensitive adaptation that the embellishments made from the source material work so well. The first half, sticking closely to Raymond Briggs story, is full of charming little details as the Snowman is invited into the young boys home and experiences the wonders and dangers of everyday objects we all take for granted. The film then takes flight, quite literally, and abandons the confines of the original story to embark on an epic and joyous journey. Both halves perfectly compliment the other and it never feels haphazardly stitched together.

Blu-ray Video Quality  THE SNOWMAN is presented in an aspect ratio of 1.77:1 and far exceeded my expectations. Considering the age of this film, the transfer is superb. This transfer has been re-mastered and the results are evident for all to see. The animation for this movie is pretty simple, but even so the colours and detail are evidently of the highest quality. The colour palette is bold and lifelike, blacks are solid and the image is in pristine condition. There is no sign of damage or dirt on the print and it is safe to say that the movie has never looked so good. There is a small amount of grain but this is not distracting. Edge enhancements are nowhere to be seen and compression artefacts are also non-existent. Overall, this is an amazing transfer which Universal should give up on trying to improve, as it simply cannot be done! Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures UK have supplied just the one soundtrack with this release of 2.0 LPMC Stereo Audio, but that shouldn't really come as any surprise. The soundtrack in question is a simple Stereo track which does everything it is asked for. The dialogue levels are audible throughout and the enchanting soundtrack is also clearly reproduced. For some reason, Universal Pictures UK has decided not to include subtitles with this release. The menus are animated and feature in the main soundtrack.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Snow Business Documentary: The Story of The Snowman [23:00] This documentary is the ultimate companion to the film featuring a new audio narration by John Coates. It starts off by showing some footage of Raymond Biggs where he talks about how the idea of the film came about. Raymond Biggs is heavily featured throughout and often gives his insight into various topics surrounding the movie. As expected, the animation is featured heavily, and there is also the obligatory interview clip with Aled Jones. My favourite part of this documentary is the section where several mistakes in the story are pointed out. These are not obvious mistakes, but nevertheless they are funny to watch. This is a quality documentary which leaves no stone unturned.

Special Feature: The Animatic and Storyboards: This extra features by Producer John Coats first attempt to create the film from Raymond Briggs book. What he did was to get two members of his staff to cut copies of the book into pieces and develop the story from that. The illustrations from the book, together with the new drawings of the developments were then shot under the camera to produce this seven minute animatic version of the film. Fans of the animation film will be mesmerised by this extra, and it is a welcome addition to the disc. Next up is the Storyboards, of which there are three in total. These are Goodnight, A Different Nose and Morning. As expected these are three of the most important sections of the animation film. Each storyboard has to be viewed individually.

Special Feature: Introductions from David Bowie and Raymond Briggs: The final extra on this disc is the Alternative Introduction, which was produced to help promote the film animation overseas and in particular in North America. David Bowie and with crazy haircut and all! It was brought in to do the introduction which lasts for just over a minute and a half. Even though this introduction differs only slightly, it would have been nice to have a choice of which one to watch with the main presentation.

Finally, if you are looking for a Christmas animated film which you will return to each year, then look no further than THE SNOWMAN. It is easy to see why it was nominated for an OSCAR and even thirty years on the animation is still a delight. Recreating Raymond Briggs scratchy illustrations and pastel colours is no easy feat in animation but the tactile aesthetic is still just as wonderful. There is an ageless quality to the art direction and animation that will make; THE SNOWMAN just as fresh and original in another thirty years time. The beautiful images are perfectly accompanied by Howard Blakes sweeping orchestral score whilst the signature song, Walking in the Air has become a classic in its own right. THE SNOWMAN is a perfect Christmas treat for young and old alike. The highlights of this disc are without doubt the transfer which is stunning, and the elaborate documentary. THE SNOWMAN deserves to be part of everyones collection so don't hesitate, buy this today! That is why as soon as I saw this for sale I had to have it in the ultimate Blu-ray format, as it shows off this magical animation film in its full glory and will ever be associated with Christmas and should be an annual event over the festive period, than watch it when it is broadcast on your television. Highly Recommended!

1184192,5,B0000048V8,"Truly glad that this British Treasure is being dusted off and offered again here in US on DVD in this new release since the older DVD version was out-of-print in the US for some time.
Over all I can't say enough about this great little film that lifts the heart and has one of the most all time beautiful song's featured in it ""Walking in the air"" sang by a boy soprano with the voice of an angel this song it self sets the mood of film as one filled with magic and wonder and fits the scene perfectly tailored as the Snowman takes the little boy on magical Christmas Eve journey to the North Pole and takes us along as well.
The Snowman is a lovable and beloved character in the UK as you will soon see and agree as well.
He is simply charming the Snowman will hug your heart and never let go nor will you want him too.
It is one of the greatest Christmas Specials to come out of England since A Christmas Carol.
Truly it is magic that will put a smile on your face,that is unless your a Grinch but that's a whole different story and hopefully not the case with your Yuletide spirit!
I highly recommend that this Christmas special should be in every home.
Also the Snowman and the Snowdog DVD is the sequel to the Snowman that is very much as good as the first one.
I would also get the soundtracks/CDs to both films the music is heavenly good and the plushies do want a home too,so that you can snuggle and cuddle with them as you watch the films.
So grab a cup of hot cocoa and Christmas cheer and settle in for a classic The Snowman",1413244800,25,1536,4.1404682274247495

1184269,5,B0000048V8,"The Snowman is a short animated film based on the childrens book by Raymond Briggs. This inspirational film came out in 1982, several years before I was born. The film is scored by Howard Blake with the exception of the nostalgic song ""Walking in The Air"" sung by a choir boy Peter Auty of the St. Paul's Cathedral. The Film was directed by Dianne Jackson and produced by John Coates. May John Coates R.I.P. This film features an introduction by one of my favorite Artists David Bowie in the 1983 release. Some of the animators involved include Arthur Butten, Tony Guy, Hilary Audus, David Baillie, Vicky Emptage, Vanessa Clegg and others. I know that Hilary Audus and Dianne Jackson were the Storyboard artists. John Cary was the film editor. This Film reminds me of my childhood everytime I watch it in which words cannot describe. I would watch it with my Grandmother and Great Grandmother and it would bring comfort through my parents divorce. I also played the song for my daughter the day I brought her home from the hospital after she was born. I laid with her caressing her head listening to this beautiful tune. I have shared it with those special in my life as well. Today at 28, this film still brings tears to my eyes. With it's soothing pastel colors it brings an aura of magic and innocence. This film takes you into a journey of love and hope, but most of all a friendship between James and The Snowman. Full of emotion this film has no speaking and that is where the wonderful music and soft visuals take you on the journey. Such a simple tale yet so heartwarming it gives you comfort in any struggle that you might be having in your life. The joy of your inner child is any remedy known to humanity to those who embrace it. The ending is sad and painful yet a reminder of reality and that the memories that James shared with The Snowman. These memories between this friendship will live on forever. The memory of sneaking The Snowman into his home and of flying through the sky while visiting a faraway land and meeting Santa Claus as well as other Happy Snowmen is priceless. If you haven't seen this film its a must! Now as a father I relive the magic every Winter when I watch it with my daughter. This Film is very special. Enjoy!",1384214400,,2251,4.479318734793187

1184271,5,B0000048V8,This is one of the loveliest DVDs ever.  I showed it every winter to my classes in NYC public schools and even the behavior problems sat still the entire time.  There are only a few minutes of narration at the start and then the rest is picture/music.  It is the story of a boy and his snowman and their adventures when the snowman comes alive at the stroke of midnight.  Beautiful illustrations and the music is wonderful (George Winston on piano).  My grandkids love it too.  We often dance together to the Scottish music at the snowman's party.  So much fun for them.  Highly recommend this DVD for the winter holidays.  Makes a terrific gift.,1382227200,,646,4.547826086956522

My grandson began watching it on VHS when he was three.  He is now nine and has never forgotten how much he loved it.  That is why I bought the DVD version so we can continue to enjoy it.

I wanted to introduce my American family to this quintessentially English story with its special magic.  There is now a lovely photo of my 40+ nephew and his 18 month old daughter both equally entranced as they watched the DVD.  Hopefully, a new Christmas tradition has been born.
For those who don't know it, it's a magical tale of a young boy and the night when his snowman came to life.  The film is virtually silent.  There are a few introductory words from the author and Aled Jones singing 'Walking In the Air'.  As my elder niece said ' Oh, that's where that's from.'

This version is not the one with David Bowie (as mentioned by other reviewers), but far worse are the changes made the the ""Father Christmas"" story.  It's as if some ultra-politically-correct editor redid the whole story.  Gone are all of the things that made the original version great--the cranky Father Christmas, all of the ""Bloomin""s, and any scene in which Father Christmas (gasp!) drinks alcohol or shows his backside.

She's 16 now and I bought it for her in DVD for Christmas.  As a matter of fact I bought 3--I plan on giving one to a friend for her grandson and one for me to keep.  I watched it by myself when it arrived and was still enchanted by the magical snowman and the Christmas eve journey.  I think my granddaughter will be surprised to see it again after all this time.  I recommend this for anyone from 1 to adult if you believe in magic and wonder.  It's only about 30 minutes long --- so it's good for a young child.,1355097600,,641,4.0078740157480315

Of course, I had to order a copy for us to watch immediately.  He loved it, as did I.  It's become a much anticipated Christmas Eve tradition for us ever since.

1184351,5,B0000048V8,"The Snowman is one of those magical Christmas stories that has become a firm family favorite, and I have been watching it every Christmas for many years now. My almost eight-year-old daughter has become a fan too, watching it since she was a toddler. It has been wonderful to see her changing expressions, from interest and wonder, to poignancy as the story draws to an end.

This 1982 London's Channel 4 production has David Bowie providing the introduction to the story which has no dialogue, only background music, a lovely score composed and conducted by Howard Blake. The story tells of an English boy's magical encounter with a snowman who comes to life one night. The boy had built the snowman earlier that day and at the strike of twelve midnight, the snowman comes to life and is invited into the boy's home where the pair proceed to indulge in some hilarious antics. The snowman is captivated by all that he sees and touches - electric switches, the boy's parents' wardrobe, and many more. Though there is no dialogue, anyone can appreciate the story by the expressive facial expressions on the snowman and the boy, and young children especially will delight in the pair's antics.

Later that same night, the snowman takes the boy on  a magical ride in the sky, over snow-capped terrain, and into a world filled with beauty and wonder. This is a must-watch film, for it attests to the power of a vivid imagination and reinforces the notion of affection and the bonds of friendship.",1354579200,,1491,4.749034749034749

It ended up initiating a conversation about what bittersweet is and how it's the happy parts you need to remember when something sad occurs. Yeah, that didn't really help.

1184387,5,B0000048V8,"At first I didn't recognize this story when I got the book for my nephew recently, but I later realized it was based on a holiday cartoon special I had seen as a child on PBS (But I didn't think I cared for it as a child because of the unsatisfying ending...talk about a CLIFF-HANGER; it totally left me at a loss!). Today, however, it has grown on me and I think it is one of my favorite holiday specials of alltime! I seem to remember PBS introducing it as ""Frosty the Snowman""...

  Frankly I didn't remember much of the film as a child except the fact that the snowman had a huge impact on me and I was soo touched by his special friendship with the boy...I don't think I watched the movie all the way thru until recently but I totally remember the ending. I knew what was going to happen when James awakens to the sun shining the day after his magical night with his special friend the snowman, and my heart was breaking as I watched him making a beeline outside to find that all that remains of his beloved friend has become a puddle, a hat, a scarf and some pieces of coal...(still makes me weep). When he melted, I felt like I had lost a best friend...I felt/ feel like he had become my friend, as well as James's. The Snowman had totally captured my heart!

  What is truly interesting is getting other peoples perspectives on what I initially considered a tragic story. My nephew saw the movie with his first grade class and he is just as sensitive as me and he claimed he didn't think it was sad at all, and that nobody else cried. They all loved it...as a child I loved the snowman but couldn't stand to watch the ending.

 I just watched the Snowman movie again all the way through and it is delightful. I laughed and I cried. It is definately a favorite. I am SO GLAD that James runs back and hugs the snowman when they say goodnight...I think that is soo important. It reminds us to live every moment as though it were our last and not take loved ones for granted...you never know when it will be the last time you will see them.
 First time I saw the movie, at the end, I misunderstood about the scarf James is holding. I thought he was holding up the snowman's green plaid scarf to remember him by--which is truly sorrowful--when in fact it is the blue snowman scarf Father Christmas gave him on their trip to the North Pole. The significance is that it proved the adventures of the night before were not a dream after all. Love, love, love!! This is one of the BEST movies of all times. It triggers so many different emotions. Check out the bleak godforsaken whiteness surrounding James and the remains of his beloved snowman--you can feel the desolation. It makes your skin crawl. If I could change one thing I'd change the ending. I'd have the snowman go to the North Pole with Frosty.
 For all you snowman fans, be sure to check out the official website: [...] (they won't let me post the address here but google The Snowman and you should be able to find it)!
Also, I watched Father Christmas. James and the Snowman make a second trek to the North Pole to meet up with Santa Claus again!! I was sooo overjoyed!!! Obviously, the snowman is still alive LOL.",1309478400,3,3177,4.333333333333333

When my kids were little, I bought a VCR tape of The Snowman that has the most peaceful music I've ever heard, which is why I could play the tape every day without getting tired of overhearing it.  The main premise of this story is that it does not include any human interference.  Each viewer (or reader of the wordless book version) has to imagine what's being said.

Now that my kids are grown, I bought the DVD version for my day care kids so that I wouldn't wear out my VCR tape.  The DVD version includes terrible vocals dubbed over the most pleasant part of the music of this movie.  I was horrified.  When I mentioned it to my daughter, she said that I was surely mistaken because that would ruin the whole tone of the movie.

A review of the VCR tape proved that, sadly, I was not dreaming.  I can't imagine what possessed the manufacturer to tarnish this lovely story with someone singing over the beautiful notes of the instruments AND NOT MENTION IT IN THE ADVERTISEMENT YET.

The two become friends, and the snowman explores the boy's house. Later on, the two go on a journey out in the open, from riding a motorcycle through the fields to flying north to meet Father Christmas (aka Kris Kringle). I've always loved reading the original children's book when I was little, and I was in even more awestruck at the animated adaptation. This is about 25 minutes long, and it's gorgeous from beginning to end. There is no dialogue whatsoever, but it shouldn't be a fault because it's the visuals that makes this film so mesmerizing. The animation is breathtaking as it looks exactly like the original illustrations. Oh, and we should never forget the music. The song ""Walking in the Air"" is probably made famous because it's used in the second half of this film. The lovely vocals blends in perfectly with the entire ""flying"" sequence.

How come we never see more films like this one anymore? It's a real shame. Fortunately, we still have The Snowman and many other classics that we can always enjoy watching. This is absolutely timeless and should never be ignored.

You won't be able to do resist; that much I can promise you.

This is by far one of the most amazing short films I have ever seen.  This is film about a mutual exploration; the child-protaganist builds The Snowman, and then through magic, this Snowman comes to life.  The child invites the Snowman indoors, where the child shows the Snowman the inside of the house.  The Snowman explores the child's world, showing the audience how things so familiar to us become things of oddity and wonder to the Snowman.

Then, in turn, the Snowman invites the child to explore the Snowman's world.  It is at this point of the film that we are taken on a flying journey into the magical world of the snowman, a world that observes our own, but is still apart from our own.

Be prepared for the ending of this film:  It is NOT what you would expect at all.  It says something about what we lose when we cease to be children, and become adults.

1184425,5,B0000048V8,"Unlike many of the reviewers here,""The Snowman"" was NOT part of my local TV seasonal line-up during my youth,nor did I see it as a child. I'm an Australian of early middle age who has never even SEEN snow.
In 1992,I was a twenty-something aspirational filmmaker who only saw the film's flying sequence as part of an animation theory class at art college. But the feelings I experienced during those few minutes were so intense & complex,& the images I saw so achingly beautiful,for years I wanted to track down a copy of the whole film. Even my comic-mad younger classmate,rather more cynical & worldly than I was,who never used superlatives about ANYTHING said simply,""It's so beautiful it makes me want to cry."" Indeed.
Well,last year,thanks to the wonderful twin technologies of DVD & internet,I finally ordered a copy. Well,it did not disappoint. Being some 15 or so years older,the joys it celebrates are even sweeter and more painful.(no,that isn't a contradiction.)Childhood's idealism sometimes seems farther away than ever. But for 30 minutes,you CAN go back in time.
Like most good art,it's based on a deceptively simple premise:little boy builds snowman. Snowman comes alive. They Have An Adventure. The rest,as they say,is magic.
The animation is flowing & lyrical,and as someone trained in animation myself I can only marvel at the many months of toil it must have taken to produce the sensitive,softly rendered drawings in coloured pencil. This is pre-computer animation,folks-all of those drawings were done by hand,and they're absolutely faithful to the source material.(Raymond Briggs' original picture book,which is a delight in itself.)When somebody argues that the time-consuming nature of animation dictates that a simplified character design is a necessity even when based on a well-known literary character(And yes,Yoram Gross,I AM looking at you & what you did to poor Blinky Bill),show 'em this film as a response.
A review of this film would be remiss without mentioning the extraordinary music,which is absolutely integral to the magic it weaves. You can HEAR the whale's tail slap the sea in the percussion,FEEL the chilly air in the young boy's falsetto,SEE the reaction of an overanxious house cat.(FWIW,there is a wonderful audio version of the story narrated by Stephen Fry,who uses the same music in this very manner to paint a vivid aural picture of the scene) Howard Blake's soundtrack is haunting & full of emotion,yet never corny or sloppily sentimental. Peter Auty,who sings the memorable ""Walking In the Air""( often erroneously attributed to Aled Jones,who,had the hit single) must be given full credit for the sense of nostalgia & longing that his perfect soprano voice provides.
And yes,the scene where after the Snowman repays his young host's hospitality by grabbing his hand and flying to the North Pole (for a Snowman party,no less!) still makes me quietly weep like a tap.(At my age I can blame it on peri-menopause,so getting older has its perks.).Maybe it's the amazingly beautiful little set pieces in it-the dazzling northern lights,the majestic sweep of the whale's tail,the way the ground revolves as if in a dream,it's hard to say. Perhaps it's a return to a time when you believed anything was possible if you believed earnestly enough:I don't know. I try not to analyze it too much. But if you can watch it without turning into a puddle,you're either made of tougher stuff than I am or a card-carrying member of The Heartless Bastard Club.(Take your pick.)
For a few minutes,all the cynicism borne of the hard knocks of adulthood dissipates,and the world is a wonderful place full of magical potential. And you realise:you never REALLY forsook that idealism of youth. You merely forced yourself to forget to function in the 'sensible' real world. And when you realise it has never really left you,you cry.
Not that the film is maudlin. There are plenty of giggles to be had,whether it be the little boy's bare bum as he hurriedly changes into outdoor clothes,or the Benetton ad-like Snowman party,where large white fellows dance the jig in every national costume from the kilt & sporran & African fez to an Australian bush hat.(Well,my sister built a snowman in the Victorian snowfields once,maybe it's him!) :-).Even Santa makes an appearance. And it all warms the spirit without being trite.(After watching this film you'll NEVER be able to stomach that crappy stop-motion 'Rudolph' film from 500000000 B.C. again)
Another reviewer expressed consternation about the suitability of the ending for young souls(he melts) but having seen my sensitive 3 yr old niece cope quite well with it(""Where he go,Aunty Sette?""),I think it's a wonderful introduction to the themes of transcience & loss. Besides which,this is a film for families to watch together. Anyhoo,we don't REALLY know if he melted,do we?You can always tell your little 'un he went back to the Snowman party if their screams threaten to make your Xmas pud stick in your chest.
Joking aside,this is a wonderful film that celebrates innocence,friendship,laughter & the joys of childhood. It also could be seen as a reminder to express our affection for loved ones before they are gone & to enjoy transient happinesses without judgement. Or,it can be seen as a marvellous fantasy kids of all sizes can enjoy.
I have talked to people from many works of life,who live in varying climes,and have yet to find someone who didn't find some real value in it.(Does the lady who bought the book & griped about the ending count?)Anyhow,add it to your holiday viewing list this year & you'll have a lovely seasonal memory to cherish.
Heck,watch it any time of the year. Such a tribute to Idealism,Kindness & The Imagination should NEVER be out of season.",1240444800,4,5756,5.072784810126582

1184433,4,B0000048V8,"I first saw this on PBS, back when it was new, and I recorded it and watched it many, many times with my son.  It's very soft and tranquilizing, as the landscapes are hushed by snow, and no words are ever spoken.  The rest is all lulling symphony music, with a lovely vocal interlude during the sweeping flying sequence.  It's a gorgeous little piece of work.

Now, the version I saw so long ago did in fact have David Bowie as the man introducing it.  But this was an edit for American television.  I bought a different copy of this a few years back (a DVD which included another Christmas cartoon), and it had the original introduction restored to it.  And I know that this is the original opening because it begins with the narrator walking along the edge of an open field in front of the woods, the same woods that in the next instant become the animated landscape, where the story begins.  That's the version that's on this DVD, the original version, and I know this because it arrived today.  But who narrates the introduction doesn't matter.  This is an artfully crafted work to be treasured in any library, and I wouldn't let the fact that Bowie isn't introducing it from a cozy attic discourage my owning it.  Yes, for the sake of nostalgia, I wouldn't mind seeing that one again, but for the sake of collecting, I'll settle for this original edit.

Only a grownup can really appreciate the level of artistry that went into this 27-minute confection, but children, too, are enthralled by it for other reasons.  Watch it with them, and have a real moment you'll keep for a lifetime.  I did.

1184442,5,B0000048V8,"Many people complained that the DVD they ordered did not include the David Bowie introduction they loved as children.  Having seen both introductions, I can't really say that one is better than the other.  I grew up with the Raymond Briggs introduction (which happens to be the original).  I purchased the DVD here in the hopes that I would get the same ""wrong"" introduction so many people have complained about, and Amazon is still selling DVDs with Raymond Briggs, despite the product description.  There also used to be a version of this film in which ""Walking in the Air"" only appeared as an instrumental in the film.  Fortunately, this DVD does include Peter Auty's performance in the movie.

Two things on a technical note: the film starts with an aspect ration note: ""This film has been modified from it's original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen.""  I'm not sure why it says that.  This film has only ever been full screen (it was made for TV in 1982, so there was no widescreen audience to cater to).  When you see this message, don't worry that your DVD has been modified in any way.  It couldn't be any closer to the original release in 1982.  Also, you might experience some trouble if you try to play the DVD on your XBox 360.  The audio would not play on mine.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with my XBox, or with XBoxes in general, but I tried several times, and the audio never worked on the XBox.  It worked flawlessly on my DVD player and on my roommate's computer, however.

Finally, the movie; there's not much to say that hasn't already been said.  It truly is a brilliant classic.  The animation is amazing, the story is wonderful, and the soundtrack is incredible.  This is a Christmas special you will want to watch AT LEAST once every Christmas.  Don't worry about the reviews that say it has a sad ending.  It's really a matter of opinion - I'd call it bittersweet.  Either way, it's the best way to end the story.",1211932800,10,1959,4.505681818181818

When I brought this fact to the attention of Amazon support, (asking them if maybe I had just ordered the wrong version, and if so WAS there a version with Bowie included?), they simply offered to take back the disc, and give me a refund. Fair enough, I suppose, but I really wanted a copy of The Snowman, so I kept what I had.
  Unfortunately, I see that Amazon is still advertising this DVD as including the Bowie material. Bowie has a history of being involved with children's music, etc. I have a green vinyl recording of Bowie narrating the orchestral piece ""Peter and the Wolf"", as well as ""A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"". And, of course, there's always the classic film, ""The Labyrinth"". It would have meant a lot to me to have been able to have a copy of ""The Snowman"" with Bowie's intro, and narration... too bad that Amazon continues to falsely advertise this DVD as containing the Bowie material.

I barely remember this from when I was young. I guess I knew it more from the score, and the infamous ""Walking In The Air"" track. It also got a revival recently in the UK with a spoof advert, advertising a popular (but disgusting) Scottish drink. Bleurgh!

I just didn't enjoy it as much as my parents seemed to. I found it incredibly boring, and I forgot there's literally no voices in it. (Apart from a peroxide blonde David Bowie introducing it at the start.) The score definitely makes it up for me. It's an excellent score, and actually made me feel Christmassy. Always good!

So, I'm not good on words and writing reviews, but here are my two cents (and here goes nothing)... I loved this movie as a child.  I never knew the name (or maybe I did, but just forgot) and recently it came into my mind a few weeks ago.  I did a search on Yahoo! Search and came upon ""The Snowman.""  When I saw the cover, I knew that this was it-- this was the movie I loved so much as a kid.  I wanted to purchase it right away, so I did-- first by going online and looking it up on eBay.  I was bidding up to $25+ on this movie.  I did not end up winning the item.  Someone notified me on eBay (a member) and told me that ""The Snowman"" was on sale for $4.99 on Amazon-- on your site!  I was like, ""What?! $4.99?! No way!""  Had to check it out right away, and to my surprise, she was right!  I ended up buying this DVD, right here, on Amazon and saving up to $20! I am VERY happy!

They played it so often, it's a miracle that it still has not worn out. Now, in the year that both graduated from college, we think it's nice to give both the DVD of this timeless little story.
As parents we liked that it was such a 'fresh' story, not one of the traditional, somewhat worn-out, central-European or American fairytales. Actually we would have not minded if Santa had not been the center of the snowmen get-together. We definitely enjoyed the absence of tradional Christian themes or figures.
The character development is great. In 23 minutes getting a friend, share things out of one another's lifes, then having to live on after hardly a goodby.
Finally, it'll prove to be an historic piece, when the next generation children will ask their parents: ""was there, back in those days, really that much ice and snow on the North Pole?""",1197676800,,964,4.710059171597633

At the sign of the first heavy snow we would rush out and beginning rolling the snowball that would form our snowman's body.

1184492,5,B0000048V8,"The Snowman is a true Christmas Classic in every sense of the term.  I personally have been looking for it on and off since the last time I saw it when I was about 10 or 11 (now i'm 20) and was overjoyed to find it here on Amazon.

The quality is much better than I would have expected for somthing of this age that doesn't have enough demand in the open market to warrant full restoration.  Watching it, the only way I could have guessed that it was as old as it is based on the content and quality of story that is so hard to find in modern childrens stories.  The movie itself has a very old world timeless feel to it that really creates a sense of nostalgia and contentment that I'm sure at least the latter of which would be felt by a viewer of any age.

This past Chirstmas I watched it with my grandparents who had never seen it, and my mother showed it to her Pre-K class, who also had never seen it.  Both age groups (4-5 & 85+/-) found it unanimously enjoyable.

The only complaint I hear voiced from others in the online community is that this copy doesn't have the David Bowie intro that used to be shown on TV in America.  That is because this is the original British version with the intro by Raymond Briggs, the author of the story.  Now as a big David Bowie fan, I would sort of like to hear his intro (I can't remember it from my childhood) but I would never trade it for this original one with Raymond Briggs.  Mr. Briggs' voice and image really sets the mood in a wonderful tone that I can't imagine can be substituted by David Bowie, no matter how much I like him.

I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough for those of you who have vague recollections of it from your childhood, and I would recommend it even more strongly for parents of young children today.  Unfortunatly, this is no longer shown in America as far as I can tell, so it is very important that people keep this rich tradition alive and have a copy availible for their children.  You and they will be very glad you did, this is a christmas special completely different than all others and in a class of its own.",1170892800,2,2099,4.204488778054863

HOWEVER, the version we are reviewing here indicates David Bowie delivers an intro and he's not on the DVD at all -- it's OK without him but reference to his name should be removed from the DVD cover.  I think it's Raymond Briggs giving the voice-over intro.  I also like this DVD best as I don't care for the Father Christmas film at all.

1184508,4,B0000048V8,"From the moment you hear the tinkling piano keys that play over the opening titles, you know ""The Snowman"" is going to be a heartbreaker. Unfortunately, there may be more heartbreak in store for those who purchase ""The Snowman"" on DVD believing they are getting the version they remember.

There are at least three versions of this film: there's one that's introduced by the author, Raymond Briggs, and features an entirely instrumental score (the version I first saw and still prefer.)

Still another version retains the Briggs intro but includes a vocal version of ""Walking In the Air"" that, in my opinion, breaks the magic spell that the film so ably casts.

And, finally, there's a version introduced by David Bowie. I'm not sure whether that features the boy sorprano on the soundtrack or not.

I'm also not sure which of these versions is THE original that earned an Academy Award nomination for 1982.

However, this particular DVD is guilty of false advertising. The David Bowie introduction promised on the cover (and in the description at Amazon) is nowhere to be found. Instead, this particular edition is identical to the one released on a disc in tandem with ""Father Christmas."" In other words, you get the Raymond Briggs introduction and the vocal rendition of ""Walking In the Air."" (But, remember, no Bowie.)

Although I'll always prefer the purely instrumental version of the film, ""The Snowman"" remains a delightfully sweet and sad story in every incarnation. It magically captures the melancholy of Christmas as superbly as it conveys its joys. Animated in lovely pastel-like colors and given considerable dramatic weight by Howard Blake's hauntingly beautiful score, ""The Snowman"" brings Raymond Briggs' short story to brilliant life.

1184513,5,B0000048V8,"It isn't often that a movie is able to capture the charm and delights of being a child.  Usually the adults attempting to make such a movie are unable to find the magic that lives in the hearts and imagination of children.  The makers of ""The Snowman"" had no such trouble.

This movie is about a young boy ... a day in the life of a young boy.  This likable lad builds himself a snowman, and he loves it very much.  That night, at midnight, the snowman magically comes to life, and the two of the them ... the boy and his snowman ... embark on a series of adventures together.  These adventures start small but soon escalate into some very daring (and heart-warming) escapades ... with the final adventure being the sort of thing kids the world over dream about.

""The Snowman"" begins with a bit of live action and a brief narration, but after that everything is animated and there are no voices ... no speaking parts at all ... just background music.  But this background music is excellent ... very well matched to the action taking place.  And the animation is very good ... warm and comfortable to the eyes.

I think the enduring charm of ""The Snowman"" comes from the purity and innocence of the little boy's thoughts and feelings ... and also from the love and caring that is shown by the snowman.  These things give the movie a fullness and a richness ... and make us take the film to our hearts.",1162944000,4,1402,4.395348837209302

The film's shown every Christmas on Channel 4 here in the UK and on watching it as an adult it's almost as much fun as it was back then. The quality of the animation and attention to detail is simply stunning, especially on the flight sequencies - from the middle of the English countryside, flying southwards over the Brighton Palace Pier of all places, then along the Channel, northwards over the North Sea to Scandinavia and up into the high Arctic.

There are lots of small graphical touches as well, such as the ""Kung Karl Hotell"" that appears briefly on the way back, not to mention the ever present snow...

The boy brings the snowman in the house and they have fun in the kitchen and bedroom, and then they fly to the North Pole to see Santa Claus. It's all done without dialog and the soundtrack of ""We're walking in the air..."" is so wistful and bittersweet, you'll just love it.

I was a young lad when I first saw ""the Snowman."" Watching cartoons like ""Silverhawks"" and ""The Mighty Orbots"" had left me jaded, cynical, and violence-prone. Following that course would have ended me up in heaps of trouble--I might've even been wanted by the C.I.A.!
Fate intervened on a cold, wintry day in fourth grade, when our wonderful teacher treated us to an in-class video. Little hooligan that I was, I scoffed when the title ""the Snowman"" appeared. Before long, however, I was swept into a world of beauty, love, and swirling snow. I was transfixed by the image of the Snowman and the little boy soaring o'er the countryside, able to leave all their cares below.
From that day, I've spread joy, peace and love to others. It amazes me that I was once so foolish and cruel. A simple, lovely cartoon changed all that.

Fortunately, I own this film on DVD (which is actually a double feature with another holiday classic:  Father Christmas- check it out if you have a DVD player), so I no longer have to worry about our copy breaking from over-use.

Everyone, whether you're a kid or not, should see  this 23-minute short. It never fails to clear my more cynical thoughts  away, which is quite an accomplishment.

I'm  buying another copy, even though my friend gave me hers when she saw how  attached we were to it - I figure it will make a wonderful present for some  other small child.
