8472715,4,B005H7OW9G,"This Russian film is described as `Battle Royale' meets `Escape from New York', and it could be said to be slightly correct, so what on earth is it really about? Well the sleeve tells us that it is set in 2013 (that means its sci fi, but only just) and that the world's population of life serving, violent prisoners has got to the state where it is unmanageable. The death penalty has thus been repealed and the International community has asked Russia to sort out the problem. I did not get this from the actual film though.

Russia come up with a plan to ship the first batch of ne'er do wells off to some sub Arctic island and sort of let them get on with it - hence the comparisons to `Battle Royale'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Royale-English-Subtitled/dp/B007MJSYF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Royale (English Subtitled)</a>. The thing is these guys have already started killing each other on the transport ship as some of them are Chechens and have some severe enmity with the their fellow inmates - it is pretty violent pretty quickly. Once on the island they are told they have all they need to last for three months and they will be monitored via a `sputnik' (satellite). They are told they are starting a new `colony', but without any women. Tell a lie, they do have a copious amount of `inflatable executive recreation devices' and I don't mean Space Hoppers.

They are all in handcuffs with an individual number on them, and the guards announce that there is a different key for each one. These keys are then dumped in the sand. Once the brave guards have run away, quite quickly, it all kicks off.

It is like a distorted version of `Lord of the flies', as they have to work out how they are going to survive, especially when they find out they share their `Godforsaken land' with some pretty voracious lemmings. In actual fact it has more in common with the true life story of the wreck of `The Batavia'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batavia-s-Graveyard-The-True-Story-of-the-Mad-Heretic-Who-Led-History-s-Bloodiest-Mutiny/dp/0609807161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batavia's Graveyard: The True Story of the Mad Heretic Who Led History's Bloodiest Mutiny</a>

This then is a brutal, violent tale, about survival, loyalty, reason and society. It is almost a polemic on the modern world, with the strongest winning and people allowing themselves to be bullied into doing things they would have previously not even contemplated.

There are a few plot holes, some questionable CGI and some dodgy accents. That is when the Officials speak in English, but this does not really harm the overall film. Director Alexandr Melnik, has done a great job of getting the best out of the actors and the location and yes it is sub titled. I wanted to give this five stars, but to be totally honest it is very good but not excellent, and I hope it gets to a wider audience, because despite the comparisons to other work, I thought this was an original piece of cinema",1336867200,2,3056,5.140845070422535
