7978795,1,B0000844JA,"Don't buy from these rip-off artists. You can go buy each of these movies individually for alot less money to make your own set. These crooks charging over $54 plus $2.98 or more for shipping this set is ridiculous I don't care what they think. There is reasonable demand and then there is highway robbery. ""Children of the Corn"" sells for $10.99, ""Creepshow 2"" $10.99, and ""Maximum Overdrive"" $8.49. So you're talking $30.47 plus shipping for your own set and keeping all your hair, well if you aren't bald already that is. By the way I recommend getting Amazon Prime to cut your shipping costs if you order a half dozen or more items each year. I order in the neighborhood of twenty to thirty usually. When you figure you save $3-8 with each order you save at least $18-110 plus each year after your membership fee. Did I mention Prime is two day shipping? It is very fast. If you enjoy these movies be sure to catch ""Christine"", ""Misery"", and ""The Mist"". - C. Luster",1215648000,2,969,4.511363636363637
7978796,5,B0000844JA,"I bought this movie for creepshow 2, but when i watched that i was a bit dissapointed, but it was still way good! but when i watched the other two i was suprised how good they where! maximum overdrive was funny as hell and children of the corn was scary as hell! and creepshow 2 was ok! if you love horror and stephen king, then buy this box set! it is definatly worth you money!",1079395200,2,379,4.066666666666666
7978797,5,B0000844JA,"I noticed people on here are giving these movies bad reviews because they say these are not up to kings books. well king is long winded, and reading one of his books can just about be a waist of time. ""IT"" was over 3000 pages, or was it 4000, cannot remember, but it was ridiculous. Horror was never meant to be boring! Maximum Overdrive is definitely a dated movie (smells of the 80's) but it was funny and bloody, and had a great sound track, lots of action!! SO did creep show, and children. I noticed the other reviewers also mentioned liking king movies I would consider being slow. I don't think they like gore, they want a bunch of story line. Bring on the action baby. BTW - I love king, don't get me wrong, and feel free to read his books, I have read some myself. I'm just saying I'd rather see the movies. Oh and for the record, to everyone who bad mouthed maximum overdrive: i could be way mistaken, but I think mr. King had the most involvement in the making of that movie then he did with any of the others. All his other movies (especially now days) are wrote by other people, and are their interpretations of his work, not his own.

7978798,2,B0000844JA,"Stephen King book to film adaptions are a bit like picking through a barrel of apples: some are good (Misery, The Shining, and Dolores Claiborne), and some are not so good (Pet Sematary, It, and The Stand). This collection leans more towards the latter with 3 mediocre-at-best movies with few frills.
Two of the movies included here are beyond abysmal, ""Creepshow 2"" and ""Maximum Overdrive"". ""Creepshow 2"" contains none of the wit, stlye, or camp of the original movie. All it gives us is [weak] storytelling, lousy acting, and few points of interest. ""Maximum Overdrive"" fairs somewhat worse, with machines coming to life and killing people. More inexplicable is the fact that Stephen King directed this movie, and did it with seemengly no attention to style or cohesive storytelling. These two movies are pretty much the bottom of the barrel for Stephen King enthusiasts.
The only redeeming feature of this collection is the campy ""Children of the Corn"", which is by no measure an excellent movie, but it has it's moments. When I was yonger, this movie was a favorite. I would watch it once in a while for camp value, but nothing more.
The fact that this DVD collection is a bargain-bin filler probably explains why there are no extras, outside of the trailers included on a few of the discs. Fans hoping for a more complete retrospective of King's movies will be sorely disappointed by the lack of extras, if they are not already let down by the movies themselves. Overall, there is little to recommend this set on. Save your money.",1050624000,2,1535,4.818181818181818
7978799,3,B0000844JA,"well, i got this set about 2 weeks ago in the store. i hadnt watched creepshow or children of the corn in awhile so i figured i would get it. the creepshow dvd is pretty cool and is worth the money and the children of the corn isn't a great movie but its a classic and is one of those movies that isn't really scary but theres somthing about it that just makes it unique and a classic. the only scary part in that movie is when the people in the diner get posioned and another part from the diner im not gona say here in case you havnt seen it yet but the last dvd (( maximum overdrive)) .... the machines and trucks go haywire and attack the people by some unknown unseen force or somthing. the concept is good and the story but the acting and the movie is .... if your a hardcore stephen king fan get this collection or just get the 8 dvd collection from stephen king or buy only one disc, id skip this if your not really a huge stephen king fan but its a ok compilation.",1049932800,,973,4.020618556701031
