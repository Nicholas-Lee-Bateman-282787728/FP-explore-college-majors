a must for ball python fans.",1201046400,,101,3.590909090909091
8076347,3,B000A8G1QY,"The Pros: learned about natural ball python habitat, see exporters setups and how ball pythons are trapped.

The Cons: poor video quality, some repetitious sections and some off topic material.

Dr. Gorzula is a scientist that knew his trip to Ghana was a historic event. Basically, the EU wanted to ban all imports of Ball Pythons for nothing more than political reasons, but no scientific data proved there was any danger for the Ball Python population. Had the EU stopped importation, almost certainly the US and some other countries would of followed. One of his friends, a Ball Python enthusiast, thought  everybody with Ball Pythons would like to see this video. He dished out the money to  create the DVD. The original intent was to get the field work on video to accompany his report.

Most of the video is watching the trappers dig up ball pythons. This is interesting because I've never seen or heard about how they dig them up. It's the first time I got to see ball python burrows as well. I learned about their  natural habitat by observing where they found the ball pythons, also about what sizes  are commonly found in the wild (bigger than I was expecting). Most where found in very large termite nests. I was also surprised how sometimes they would often find multiple snakes in the same burrow (termite mount, or holes in the ground). A few off topic things are found on the video, which I found should of been cut out: a large school of kids touching an aligator, a ""ball python festival"", scorpions, etc  Some people may find this stuff interesting however and the video may of been too short with those sections cut off. I also really enjoyed seeing the exporters' setups. That was very interesting. Never seen any pictures or videos of that stuff before. They have way better setups than I was expecting.

One thing I recommend is to set your expectations correctly. There's nothing wrong with the video as such, but you have to know what to expect. I think part of the problem some people are having is that the marketting people made the video look like something it may not be. There are  sample videos on Dr. Gorzula's website, which can give you an idea what to  expect ([...]

So overall, I personally enjoyed the video. I personally wanted to learn about ball pythons. Fluff is nice, but not necessary to accomplish this. The DVD is also inexpensive.

I personally would like to see him go back (with a professional film crew though like National Geographics, Animal Planet, etc). I sent him an email about that.  He said he'd be open to go back. If he goes back, to try and get data like: what's the temp/humidity in the burrows, what ambient air temperatures  (night/day) are they exposed to at what time of year, etc.  I also mentionned that he should find a morph or two. Of all the  ball pythons they caught (not sure, but I think there were a couple hundreds of them), he said they did not see anything unusual.  Morphs are RARE  in the wild :-)",1141689600,5,2979,4.597353497164462
8076348,5,B000A8G1QY,"I really liked this video and can understand some of the bad reviews but they don't seem to realize that this is historical footage that cannot be repeated. They were not making a documentary when they filmed it. In fact, you could not field a professional camera crew for three months under the conditions they worked in. A professional camera crew, and their equipment, would have died within one week. During those 90 days in Ghana they only bathed in running water 10 times. This field survey is not ""bad home video on a camcorder"". It was a video recording of real bush work with no frills. I sometimes think that the comments they received would be like people saying that real time footage of the Vietnam War is crap, don't watch it, go and rent ""Platoon"", or ""The Green Beret"", or ""Full Metal Jacket"". Their video footage was visual ""field notes"" that they wanted to share with hobbyists so that they can see the EVENT that made their hobby become a reality.

All in all, I'm glad I bought this video and it's now in my library. Would I have paid $40 or more for it? I definately would have because, if nothing more, it's the actual filmed documentary of the event that allowed ball pythons to be exported from Africa. If this event never occured, I would have never had the opportunity to purchase the ball python that I've cherished as a pet for the past 8 years.

The DVD does in fact have the bonus features on it but you have to view them on your computer because it has the bonus stuff in a folder with several files (maps, photos, report, etc) in it.

Thanks for reading my review.",1141084800,3,1596,4.440273037542662
8076349,3,B000A8G1QY,"This is not a CD for the academic herpetologist. Gorzula's gritty footage taken in the African bush is not slick TV stuff, but it is the real thing!  When the hobbyist sees, buys, feeds he/she is miles from the animal's roots. This video - rough around the edges as it is - should delight all those who can recognise the real thing when they see it! It is a bit long and repetitive, but I really enjoyed it. So will others who know, or want to know, the real Africa and the real Ball python! Remember, not for those who want slick!",1139616000,5,531,4.205882352941177

8076351,1,B000A8G1QY,"This gets one star because I cannot give it a zero.
Here are some of the claims that are made on the DVD case:
""Bonus DVD Features: Maps, Photos, Figures, and Reports""
""Embark on an amazing field trip with Dr. Steve Gorzula as he takes you on a fantastic journey through the bush of Ghana, Africa to learn about and explore ball pythons in their natural habitat!""
""In addition, you will meet and come face to face with many other wild animal species including venemous spitting cobras, African pythons, imperial scorpions, dwarf crocodiles, African giant rats, grass cutters, pangolins, and hedgehogs.""
""Ideal for: Reptile hobbyists, Breeders, Teachers, Students, Thrill seekers""
""Feature running time: approx 2 hours""

What are probably some of the more disturbing short comings of this DVD are the facts that [...] the entire feature - which is well over an hour, but much closer to an hour-and-a-half than two hours (thankfully) - looks like it was filmed with a hand-held camcorder, complete with occasional static, jostling by inexperienced cameramen, noise (a continuous hum from the camera and the breathing of the person holding the camera), and overall poor-quality film.

[...]

The entire DVD feature was apparently filmed in 1997, as I said, apparently by a hand-held camcorder.  There was seemingly no professional editing of the film.  This is where so many reviewers are apparently pleased that there is ""no Hollywood fluff stuff.""  There is also very little narration throughout.  In the very few instances where Steve Gorzula does cut in to narrate what is on the screen, he does effectively explain some little tidbits about Ball Python behavior, or species that are found in the same environment.  The feature video also includes visits to two different exporters' facilities, where very little is explained, as in the rest of the feature, except by the people on the screen, who can be difficult to understand.

What is also included in the feature - which would be far more interesting than useful to anthropologists, and is pretty much useless to the ""Reptile hobbyists, Breeders, Teachers, Students, [and] Thrill seekers"" this is intended for - are several local African tribes' ceremonies and festivals.  As with the rest of the feature, very little of these ceremonies are explained, and no comments that are made really ever attempt to explain the relevance of these festivals to the feature.

The few good things that you can get out of this film are: (1) a fair visual understanding of the native habitat that Ball Pythons come from, (2) a limited understanding of what some of the other species that live in the same environment as Ball Pythons are, (3) a fair idea of the methods that are used to capture wild Ball Pythons - and why so many wild-caught Ball Pythons have so many stress-related problems, (4) a visual representation of how big ""really large"" Ball Pythons are, (5) a visual reference (on poor-quality film) of the difference between male and female Ball Pythons when ""popped,"" (6) one exporter's opinion about incubation temperatures for Ball Python eggs, and (7) a limited visual understanding of Ball Python nesting/brooding behavior.

As for the claims made on the DVD case, there are photos - a short slideshow included on the DVD - but there are NO maps, figures, or reports ANYWHERE in the content of the DVD.  The species listed on the case are exactly the species that are included in the feature, and while I know nothing about scorpions, the ""imperial scorpions"" listed are the ""emperor scorpions"" that are so very prevalent in the pet trade.  Many times throughout the DVD, Steve Gorzula and his companions spend some time playing with the emperor scorpions they have caught in the field.  Not terribly exciting.

I bought this DVD realizing that I was taking a risk.  I am a reptile hobbyist, and an aspiring Ball Python breeder.  The lack of information provided about this DVD made me nervous, but I was very intrigued by the blurb that said that ""this survey is the reason you can now acquire ball pythons today.""  At no time in this feature were any conclusions presented from the research conducted.  In his introduction, Steve Gorzula does mention that he did his research because in 1997, CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) was concerned that Ball Pythons could become extinct in their native habitat, and that his research convinced CITES that the Ball Python trade could continue.  No actual data is presented, either in the feature, or in the DVD extras.

[...] If you have read ""The Ball Python Manual"" written by Philippe de Vosjoli, David & Tracy Barker, and Roger Klingenberg, DVM, you probably already know what you need to know.  If you want to see the native habitat of Ball Pythons, pick up a ""Nature"" presentation on the African savannah from your library.",1136851200,10,4885,4.9522643818849446
8076352,5,B000A8G1QY,"Dr. Steve Gorzula filmed this video on location while he was in Ghana, Africa in 1997. He was petitioned to do a survey on Ball Pythons because the European Union felt that Ball Pythons might become extinct due to the trade. They were going to stop the trade but they didn't due to the survey report submitted by Dr. Gorzula. This video is historical because it's the actual footage of Dr. Gorzula working closely with ball python trappers in the bush.

You'll see firsthand how they trap and locate ball pythons in the wild. In addition, there are many other wild animals that are unearthed in their attempt to find and trap ball pythons. They catch black spitting cobras, giant African rats, African Rock Pythons, African dwarf crocodiles and other dangerous animals without the use of snake hooks using their bare hands!

Did you know that certain tribes in Africa worship the ball python and have a ball python festival each year? Did you know that these tribes perform a libation ceremony to bless trappers before they go on their grueling hunt for ball pythons? This video shows you all of this and much, much more. Did I mention that he takes you into wild animal exporters' installations as well?

If you're looking for that fluff stuff found on TV then this video is not for you. However, if you want to witness how real field biologists work in the wild then this video is for you! You won't see guys using snake hooks to capture venomous black spitting cobras or puff adders in this video. This is unscripted, raw footage of the dangerous and challenging work that goes into catching Ball Pythons in the Wild.",1123718400,6,1620,4.6573426573426575
