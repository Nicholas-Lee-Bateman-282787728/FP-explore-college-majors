7904650,5,B000006QOT,"Lucas is an enigma. Is he the worst serial killer in history, or nothing but a big-time compulsive liar enjoying all the attention ?.  This facinating programme gives a very good look at him, so you can decide for  yourself. -There's lots of ""smilin' old Henry"" footage here. For  kicks, he may have exaggerated heavily in the numbers of murders, but I  have no doubt that he's a nasty multiple killer. Only a complete idiot  would admit to something like 100+ murders, if he hadn't done it.  As with  most serial killers, his upbringing is to blame. In this case, the mother  was a violent drunken insane prostitute. Some combination. -Naturally he  ""accidentally"" killed her. This guy hated everybody, and probably  thought: ""society payback time"", when he went out looking for  victims to torture. Latest news is, he's escaped the needle for the '79  ""orange socks"" murder, due to some sudden new ""fact""  that he couldn't have been there. -Considering he knew details about the  crime only the killer could know, even pointing out the scene; to me this  sounds like a major screw-up somewhere. Instead, he'll now ""only""  rot in jail for two other murders.",935366400,,1158,4.831632653061225
