6697733,4,B00O1D37NO,"Great action movie and wonderful acting. However, the idea of ""who done it"" is way too old, and it does not make any freaking sense when a good guy turns bad and the bad guy turns good... Just like the effects of a character morphing into anybody he/she wants to in the Terminator or X-Men start to bore me.

6697734,1,B00O1D37NO,"No bad reviews? Let me remedy that. This wasn't very good at all. There were lots of questionable scenes. It was just a very bad, forgettable movie. I wouldn't recommend it at all. It could have been much, much better",1415577600,5,217,4.45
6697735,5,B00O1D37NO,"Pierce Brosnan Is Back. NOVEMBER MAN is a good old school action film. It is old school and emotionally charged. I wish they would make more films like this. This is a film style from a bygone era of filmmaking. I like this sort of film that goes by the numbers and Pierce Brosnan looks the part of the ex-operative back out in the cold again. The locations and Romain Lacourbas' Europen cinematography easily adds to the old school feel.

Director Roger Donaldson, who also directed THE RECRUIT with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell, uses a similar plot technique from that film and mixes it around as Pierce Brosnan, an ex-CIA operative is brought back into a plot where there is more than meets the eye. Roger Donaldson's direction in NOVEMBER MAN is much more retro in feel compared to the more timely aimed direction in THE RECRUIT.",1415059200,2,832,4.621621621621622
6697736,5,B00O1D37NO,"Here we have a good old-fashioned action movie, set in scenic European cities, with plenty of vehicular mayhem, gunfire, fisticuffs and blowie uppie stuff. It has loyalties, betrayals, lost loves, found loves, a child in jeopardy and people to root for. What more could we want?

Directed by Roger Donaldson (""The Bank Job"") it features:
  * Pierce Brosnan (""Love is All You Need"") Devereaux is a former CIA agent asked to come back for a personal job... Is it just me, or has Brosnan improved with age?
  * Luke Bracey (""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"") Mason is an agent who works with Devereaux. Based on the number of projects in production, it looks like I'm not the only one to see the potential in this latest Australian import!
  * Olga Kurylenko (""Oblivion"") Alice seems to be swept into a situation that is waaay over her head.
  * Amila Terzimehic (this Streisand look-alike is a Bosnian gymnast) Alexa is focused, lethal and lithe.

There is something about an international cast that appeals to me. Brosnan was born in Ireland; Donaldson and Bracey are both from Australia; Kurylenko, the Ukraine; Terzimehic, Bosnia. There are many others in the cast, very few of which are from the United States. In my opinion, film is an international endeavor and I appreciate it.

Expect some profanity, a pair of (not too) sweaty bodies, a suggested rape, lots of violence and an involving story. Our screening audience was impressed.",1412467200,160,1428,4.8838174273858925
6697737,4,B00O1D37NO,"Pierce Brosnan leads ""The November Man"" as Peter Devereaux, a retired CIA spy called back into the business to rescue a female former colleague in Moscow. When the colleague (who is also the mother of Peter's daughter) is killed by a CIA sniper, Peter will seek revenge. He quickly finds himself facing off against a former protg inside a complicated and suspenseful game of double-cross, in which he will have to take help wherever he can find it.

Brosnan slips easily back into his 007 persona, now aged and seasoned a few years. Newcomer Luke Bracey is effective as Peter's former protg David Mason, caught between conflicting loyalties. Bill Smitrovich is Hanley, the pugnacious former boss who lures Peter out of retirement. Olga Kurylenko is Mila Filapova, a young woman with a secret that a surprising number of people will kill to obtain. This workable Cold War redo offers some great action scenes and some terrific location shooting in Europe. It is recommended as good entertainment for those remember and enjoyed Brosnan as James Bond.",1412294400,81,1048,4.988571428571428
6697738,5,B00O1D37NO,"Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a super spy, retired. He worked for the CIA and trained David Mason (Luke Bracey). A former Russian General named Federov (Lazar Ristovski) is poised to become Russia's next president. A woman who was next to him under deep cover has damaging information on Federov and wants to be extracted. Peter shows up from out of retirement to help out...things go awry.

Peter now needs to find a girl (Olga Kurylenko) who has the information before the Russians or CIA do, as both want her dead. David, who was trained by Peter, is part of the CIA that wants him dead, although he has mixed loyalties. The film is interesting as Peter stays one step ahead of David as he knows how he was trained. The question as to why the CIA wants people dead is a mystery that is revealed 44 minutes into the film. The name ""November Man"" is explained 8 minutes from the end of the film or the first 10 seconds of the preview. Amila Terzimehic plays a Russian assassin whose role I would have loved to have seen expanded.

Alice: "" Do all of your friends try to kill you?""
Peter: ""Eventually.""

An interesting spy thriller, a bit formulaic, but worth a view.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and of course stripper nudity.",1412294400,73,1234,4.545045045045045
6697739,4,B00O1D37NO,"""The November Man"" (2014 release; 108 min.) brings the story of Peter Devereaux (played by Pierce Brosnan). As the movie opens, we see Devereaux and his younger CIA partner David Mason (Luke Bracey) involved in a CIA mission that ends badly and Devereux ends up retiring from the CIA. We then skip to ""Lausanne, 2008"", and Devereaux is talked into coming out of retirement, so that he can get a CIA operative out of Moscow. The operative is a woman named Natalia, and later we learn the exact connection between her and Devereaux. Natalia has obtained the name of a person who can incriminate a Russian top official who is on his way to becoming the next Russian President. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this marks the return, following his retirement as 007, of Pierce Brosnan to the spy/action/thriller genre. The story comes from Bill Granger's 1980s series of books called ""The November Man"". Brosnan looks and feels completely at ease and confident in taking on this role. Second, the movie is directed by Australian director Roger Donaldson, who has previously teamed up with Brosnan in ""Dante's Peak"". Third, you have to be a bit lucky at times, because when this was shot well over a year ago, who could've predicted that the Russians now would be the bad guys again in real life (as they are front and center in this movie)? Fourth, the action scenes are not bad, but neither will they blow you away. Compared to what we are used to seeing in other similar movies (think of the Bourne franchise and the 007 franchise), the action scenes are just average. Of course, some of that can be explained by the very modest production budget for this film (a reported $15 mill., which is a snippet of any of the 007 or Bourne films). Fifth, the movie was shot on location in Eastern Europe, primarily Belgrade, and that is definitely a plus as the scenery is outstanding. Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral score to the movie, composed by Marco Beltrami. Aloe Blacc's ""Ticking Bomb"" (from his great new album ""Lift Your Spirit"") plays over the movie's end titles.

""The November Man"" came out in theaters last month. An early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was reasonably well attended, and the audience was really into it, clapping and howling at the right times (when the baddies get their due). So it seems that there definitely an audience is for this movie. Even before the movie's release, it was already announced that a sequel would be in the making. I enjoyed watching this, even though you definitely get the sense that with a little more production, the movie could've been even better. If you enjoy the Bourne or 007 movies, I'd say you should check this out, be it in the theatres or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",1412294400,34,2916,4.671206225680934

Anyway, I don't think this movie is nearly as bad as some have made it out to be. Pierce Brosnan is better as an aging, disgruntled spy than he was as a smarmy James Bond. He cant quite keep the British out of his American accent, something he tried to disguise by speaking in a growl, but he wasn't bad.

Action scene are way more realistic, if not as flashy, as those found in a typical action movie. The plot doesnt get lost in the convoluted twists that characterize so many spy movies. The motivations of characters are made clear and, for the most part, are believable.

Much. Yes a younger audience would like it because they do not know so much

6697930,4,B00O1D37NO,"They call him the November Man because everything left in his wake is dead.  Peter Devereaux (Brosnan) is retired, living in Lausanne.  He is asked to come out of retirement to help protect a threatened agent (his former lover).  He is to pick her up in Moscow, take her to St. Petersburg and then exit to Helsinki, where he will be protected by his old pals in the CIA.  Unfortunately, it doesnt work out that way.  The November Man is dragged into an international plot that involves the CIA, a former victim of a man who aspires to become the Russian president, that Russian baddie, his A-list assassin, and a very bad person (as yet unidentified) who still works for the Agency.

Most of the scenes are shot in Belgrade and the local color is excellent.  This is a very dangerous place and, hence, the perfect setting for car chases, gunplay, prostitution, drugs, sybaritic night clubs, fruit and vegetable markets and international spies.  In the opening scenes in Russia, which are also effective, we see the full IT operation, with endless TV screens, a drone which can turn on a dime and lots of blood and bullets.  There is just enough sex and violence to justify the R rating and just enough action to fill a vacant 2 hours on a slow afternoon.

Essentially a star vehicle for Brosnan, he carries the film well; the international cast is up to the task and the production values are strong.  This is a very nice bit of entertainment which gets better and better as the plot progresses.  Four and a half stars.",1451088000,,1519,4.5851851851851855

You know what we used to call you?  The November Man.  [Be]cause after you passed through, nothing lived.

The above comes from this spy thriller based on Bill Grangers novel There are no spies (1987) and co-produced by Pierce Brosnan.

A highly-trained CIA operative (ex-James Bond Pierce Brosnan), called by his colleagues The November Man, comes out of retirement to protect a valuable witness (Bond girl Olga Kurylenko).  But his mission is compromised when he is targeted by his former protg (Luke Bracey).

This is a down-to-Earth, no-nonsense spy thriller with good action, espionage, gritty fight scenes, and lots of twists and turns.  I found the story itself quite intriguing.

Brosnan, though older, appears to be at the top of his game in this thriller.  All the other actors do good jobs in their roles.

Filming took place in Serbia (Belgrade) and Montenegro.

The budget for this movie was fifteen million.  Box office so far is thirty-two and a half million.

The DVD itself (the one released in 2014) has no extras (keeping with the movies no-nonsense nature).

Finally, a sequel to this movie has already been announced.  I look forward to seeing it.

In conclusion, Brosnan is back in the spy game and, to me at leastnobody does it better!!

(2014;  1 hr, 45 min excluding end credits;  widescreen;  9 scenes;  rated R)

6698164,2,B00O1D37NO,"They say that a great action star never gets old, someone should have told that to Pierce Brosnan. In the latest spy thriller from Director, Roger Donaldson, Brosnon is playing a retired C.I.A. agent, who is called back to duty after years away from the business. He's supposed to simply rescue a fellow asset in the field, when he gets drawn into a world wide conspiracy. I've never been that crazy about spy movies to begin with, because it seems like it's always the same thing. The story goes back and fourth, with crosses and double-crosses, leading to one fight after another and The November Man isn't much different. Brosnan is supposed to be the best agent there ever was, the deadliest, most intimidating man there ever was. Now I don't know about you, but I don't find a hundred pound British guy in his sixties to be all that intimidating. Given Brosnan's age, the film really didn't have much in the way of fight scenes, just poorly executed car chases and a whole lot of shooting. Even the dialogue in this thing was a joke, with classic Bond lines, and an enemy hiding beyond every door. The bottom line, The November Man is a cliche, with a star who is much too old to be playing the guy all the action is centered around. Luke Bracey, who plays Brosnan's former protege and nemesis, would have been much more believable as The November Man, even still, this film was just poorly written and executed all around. At one time, Pierce Brosnan was one of the best, but The November Man proves that it's time to for him to stop being the man, and start being the one behind the curtain, who controls the man.",1433808000,,1620,4.51360544217687

Pierce Brosnan plays an aging CIA functionary tasked with overseeing the development of his protege', and the plot takes off from there. Brosnan is allowed to grunt and sneer his way through a performance that hints at what his stint as James Bond would have been had he taken the Daniel Craig approach- a hard boiled, no-nonsense Bond with a vicious streak.  Here, Brosnan as protagonist Devereaux, is eminently capable of taking out bad guys even at his advanced age.

Sure, the plot is full of holes and the fight sequences allow the title combatants to slough off blows that would kill lesser men (translation: all of us), but there's a rhythm and pulse to NOVEMBER MAN which keeps you engrossed nevertheless.

6698386,4,B00O1D37NO,"Yet another action-hero from yesterday tries his hand at a return to the genre: Pearce Brosnan - once known as 007: James Bond - plays a retired spook (now isn't that ironic?) once known as the November Man, because once he passed through nothing was left alive. Deveraux is now living the quiet life in Lausanne, when his old handler comes calling, asking him to save an old friend, whos cover is about to blow. Deveraux accepts the mission for reasons which soon becomes apparent. But the mission is a bust: The woman he was tasked with rescuing is killed... by the supposedly good guys. Devereux spends the rest of the movie sifting through a swamp of corruption and backroom-dealings to avenge this murder, and in the proces discovers that the CIA had a hand in starting the second Tjetnian war.
The November Man is a good, solid cold war spoof, reminiscent of Brosnans biggest succes (007), though not quite on the same level.",1428883200,,931,4.682926829268292

6698389,4,B00O1D37NO,Good movie. This is Pierce Brosnan at his best and what I wish his Bond films could have been. The movie  has some nice twists. Good action and a good story with a couple of unexplained holes that keep it from 5 stars. I enjoyed it very much. It was naturally reminiscent of a Bond film because 2 of the stars actually did Bond films. I have long been a fan of Brosnan and enjoyed him as Bond.

6698432,2,B00O1D37NO,"Overall a slow movie that didn't have a story to match the action.
Good cast but the story was poorly written and so were the characters, which leads to bad dialogue.  In order for a story to work, you have to be at least somewhat interested in the main character (a semi-tired CIA op brought back in to extract a girl with info).  But I really didn't care much about him.  There was nothing about his character that hooked.  Add to that, a weak story and other weak characters.  It's a shame.  It could have been a really good movie if they spent more time in the story development.
I couldn't make it past 15 min (a good movie should hook you in the first 10 min or so).
I wouldn't try to watch this movie again.",1428019200,,714,4.175182481751825

6698456,3,B00O1D37NO,"The Bourne movies introduced viewers to a higher powered, higher tech version of intelligence operations. International intrigue is still the name of the game, but with satellite surveillance, street cams and all manner of electronic wizardry, the maze is tighter and tougher to beat. So, of course, there will be the imitators. This is a bit on the pale side.

Here's the scoop. A Russian uppity up is  running for president and having anyone who can do him harm knocked off. Why? Pierce Brosnan is an operative looking into things when he finds himself to be a target. He needs to find the one girl (Olga Kurylenko) who might have the key to the whys and wherefors.

Set predominantly in Belgrade this does have a lot of the razamataz notable in the Bourne flicks. Rogue operatives, gadgets, clever ways of getting out of absurdly tight situations. But it all felt just a bit short. Brosnan is Okay in his role but I didn't believe him. Something of his life is divulged in the third act that I didn't believe of him and certainly don't believe it would have gone undetected by the agency. You catch on to Kurylenko a bit too early on, and the head of the agency seemed too rough and tumble. More of a bar fighter than an intelligence big wig. All the directing, editing music and such were truly decent but it just made me want to see the Bourne flicks.

This is a decent enough watch. Just don't get your hopes too high.",1428019200,,1424,4.507751937984496

No, it wasn't deep or 'brand-new' and no spiraling intensity ratcheting up the anticipation, however, I didn't expect that. I just wanted to watch a good movie, and I did. The different film scene locations were beautiful. The actors were good, especially Luke Bracey and the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, and I always enjoy Brosnan.

6698630,4,B00O1D37NO,"Director Roger Donaldson had previously worked with Pierce Brosnan on ""Dante's Peak""; so when ""The November Man"" came up, Donaldson who is known for espionage/action thrillers like ""The Bank Heist"" (Jason Statham) and ""The Recruit"" (Al Pacino & Colin Farrell) was a slick fit.  Pierce Brosnan plays Devereaux, a spy who has retired, but is lured back into the game by Hanley played with duplicitous relish by Bill Smitrovich.  Devereaux's sidekick Mason is played by the camera-friendly Luke Bracey who is watchable in both action, drama and romance sequences.  This is his breakout role, which is why I couldn't quite place him while I was watching the film.  Ukrainian-born Olga Kurylenko who's known for ""Quantum of Solace,"" ""Hitman"" & ""Oblivion"" turns in a great nuanced performance as Alice.  She is lovely; and we can't wait for her screen appearances.  The screenplay may be a tad on the predictable side, but Donaldson keeps the action and pace brisk.  The film was shot on location in Belgrade and shows off this infrequently seen Eastern European city beautifully.  As an action thrilled, this is a solid film worth watching.

Afterward he gets mopey and lethargic then the pattern repeats culminating once again with an out of breath Bronsan guzzling scotch.  This is actually the most unpalatable portion of the film and actually made me consider giving up this familiar libation.  Then, I remembered that Johnny Walker Black is tasty and delicious and decided instead to never again watch November Man.

6698727,4,B00O1D37NO,"I've seen some reviews dissing this movie but after viewing it, I don't understand why. Certainly it's better than a lot of other ""action"" films though perhaps not with as stellar a cast. There are a good many foreign actors, but most of the Americans are recognizable by sight, if not by name.

A former CIA man is brought out of retirement to get his ex-lover out of a deep cover assignment, not unknowing the CIA is unaware of his involvement and that they've been sent to terminate her after they get her information. The shooter is a former protege he had requested be dismissed because he was unable to follow orders to the letter.  Now it becomes a cat-and-mouse game between mentor and pupil  one trying to prove he's as good as his teacher, the other well aware he isn't.  Each is coldly efficient in his own way. (One missed point: What happened to Mason's love interest after she was hustled to the hospital? Did she die? Considering how the movie ended, one expects not, though their affaire may have been finished. At that point, she's out of the picture, any way.)

There are twists and turns and plenty of shootings, with some beautiful scenery, before the final--and very appropriate--climax.  The epilogue ending is more than satisfactory and after seeing the film, no one has to guess who performed the finish to the episode.

I've only one wish:  Could we please just once, have our government be the Good Guys for a change? It's getting so the moment anyone carrying a Federal ID card shows up, one can automatically assume...covert villain.

All in all, a very entertaining, tense, but somewhat subdued movie. Brosnan is good as the aging agent and the rest of the cast is suitably villainous or heroic, as needed.",1424822400,,1735,4.6996699669967

The November Man (2014). Rated ""R"". Running Time: One Hour, 47 mins.
Directed by Roger Donaldson. Written by Michael Finch, Karl Gajdusek.
Based upon the book, ""There Are No Spies"", by Bill Granger (1987).

David Mason (Luke Bracey) is enjoying his time with his girlfriend and kissing her in public outside a cafe. Agent Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) walks up to his work partner and explains to him the bad guys are watching him and does he know what they could do to his girlfriend?
  Back on the case, Mason and Devereaux arrive at the Ambassador's mansion. They are wearing their bullet-proof vests and Devereaux is wearing a mike.  Mason goes to his stake-out place. Devereaux explains to the Ambassador (Dragan Marinkovic) their is a threat upon his life and they only have 20 minutes to get him to safety.
  Mason is in place to shoot the assassin, but there are too many hitmen there. A child is in the line of fire and Devereaux orders him not to shoot.  Mason shoots anyway and gunfire is exchanged. The child is shot. Mason doesn't care because he shot the assassin.
  Five years later, Hanley (Bill Smitrovich) calls upon Peter Devereaux who has been retired. Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musliovic), a former spy friend of Devereaux's, is working close with President Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski) as an assistant. Devereaux must help get her out of Moscow, Russia and take her to Petersburg, cross the border to Helsinki where Hanley will be waiting.
  A drone is being used to follow Devereaux.

Also in the cast: Olga Kurylenko, Caterina Scorsone, Patrick Kennedy.

Filmed in Belgrade, Serbia. Sveti Stefan, Petrovac, Hercegnovi, Perast, Montenegro. Lausanne, Switzerland.

This is the second ""James Bond 007"" actor Olga Kurylenko has worked with. Pierce Brosnan was ""James Bond"" in 1995-2002. She was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B004NEY9EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>&nbsp;(2008) with Daniel Craig, whom is the current ""James Bond 007"".

This movie is probably the closest we will ever see him playing in a James Bond-like role again.

Extra: The Making of The November Man. Theatrical Trailer.

Update: August 20, 2014. Pierce Brosnan says they are working on a sequel and pre-production should start soon.",1424563200,,2459,5.3733681462141

6698769,3,B00O1D37NO,"Pierce Brosnan returns to his James Bond persona as ""retired"" CIA operative, Devereau (still with that wonderful British accent intact) living the good life in Switzerland.  He reconnects with one of his old buddies named Hanley (Bill Smitrovich), who is now one of the higher ups in the organization.  Hanley wants to pull him back in, only to rescue a spy (Mediha Musliovic) who has gotten close to a rising politician in Russia (Lazar Ristovski) who will likely be the next president.  Devereau is chosen because of a former romantic relationship with Natalia (Musliovic).

Something goes awry in this convoluted story and Devereau seeks answers from his former co-workers.  Complicating matters further is a former protg, Mason (Luke Bracey), is involved which moves the former partners toward an adversarial relationship.  I give the filmmakers credit for not succumbing to a PG-13 rating (like Bond films).  There are well staged gun fights, unnecessary killings, gratuitous potty-mouthing and a smattering of strip club nudity.  And old 007, I mean Devereau, more than holds his own against the younger agents.

Key in the silly plot line involving a mass murder in Chechnya, is a teenage survivor of the massacre named Alice (Olga Kurylenko) who is now all grown up.  She and Deveriau reluctantly join forces to out the villains.  The script certainly could have used some polishing and some of the alliances are ridiculous,  seemingly changing for no reason.  And then there are the usual head-shaking clichs, but the film moves along quickly and provides good entertainment for 108 minutes.

The Blu ray transfer comes with 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  Most of the film was shot in Serbia, and the look is near perfect.  Excellent colors and good flesh tones throughout.  Very good detail and black levels.  I didn't see any abnormalities in the picture.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It is terrific.  Fully immersive, it offers plenty of LFE (.1) action and has a real spaciousness to it.  Dialog is clear and properly spaced.  The soundtrack is nothing special, but plays nicely throughout the film.  No complaints here either.  Spanish and English subtitles are available.  Extras include a ""Making of"" piece, another on Brosnan's return to action-films, one on Belgrade, a trailer and a commentary track with Brosnan, director Roger Donaldson and producer Beau St. Clair.",1424476800,,2433,5.127226463104326

Peter and Natalia share a romantic past. And Peters mission goes into unexpected directions.

But what direction? Now here is a big problem of The November Man, of which story lacks a distinct direction. Director Roger Donaldson did a much better job in the past, in such films as No Way Out and Thirteen Days, where he managed to build up tension, but here the film is only sporadically interesting because we are not sure what the films story is all about in the films first half. Is this about the titular hero trying to uncover some plot? Or it is about the master-pupil relationship between him and his protg David Mason (Luke Bracey)? Olga Kurylenko appears in a key role, but her character is not very convincing.

Based on a Bill Grangers 1987 novel There Are No Spies, The November Man feels like an old-fashioned spy thriller. That is not a bad thing, and the film has a few decent action sequences, but it is as a whole bland and generic.",1424131200,,1176,4.595238095238095

However...

It treats its subject with a gravitas that updates the film, and Brosnan plays his role in an age-appropriate and sophisticated way.  The relationship between Devereaux and Mason is suitably complex, understated and resolves in a satisfying way.  This film is to ""The American"" as ""Point Blank"" is to ""La Femme Nikita"", and I don't mean that in a pejorative way.

6698904,4,B00O1D37NO,"There are already almost 1100 reviews of this film on Amazon plus innumerable comments.  Therefore I dispense with general discussion of the plot, which you can easily find in so many other places, and stick to my impressions, and a challenge to those who have yet to watch it, or perhaps to re-watch it.

This is more than just another action movie, a James Bond or a Bourne wanna-be, though there is action aplenty including, very close to the beginning--yep--a typical car-chase scene.  Some say they think this is Brosnan's best film yet.  By that they probably mean best in the action-film genre, and it seems to me that after his last Bond film, succeeded already by two, going on three Bond films starring Daniel Craig, Brosnan said he felt he still had at least one more Bond-type film in him.  Perhaps this is it after all these years.

Though there are enough females in this film, they all play supporting roles.  The central dynamic is between Brosnan's retired CIA agent Devereaux, and his former protg, now a senior field operative David Mason.  At least one can say of the women that emotionally none of them are wilting lilies; they are almost all at least emotionally just as tough as the main characters, and one is portrayed as being fully as lethal as they are (whether or not that should be considered ""a good thing"")

The audience is confronted in the course of the film first, with figuring out just what the heck is going on, as Devereaux is trying to do because his mission rapidly turns into something quite different from what he'd been briefed on.  After that, the audience has to turn to deciphering the meaning of some of Devereaux's own statements and actions.  Specifically there are 2 dramatic peaks: one is a brief discourse between Devereaux and Mason (now assigned to kill him) in which he tells Mason something to the effect that in this business, one has to decide whether to be a person, who sometimes must kill others, or a person who kills other people--that you cannot be both; eventually one will destroy the other.  Judging from his past history it would appear as if he long ago chose the latter role, but his behavior with Mason suggests he actually chose the former.  Closely related to this is a scenario in which Devereaux, with no hesitation and no apparent emotion, severs the femoral artery of the young lady Mason had just slept with, all while reminding Mason that he had a choice to make: put his mission first (killing Devereaux) or saving his would-be girlfriend instead, who would soon bleed to death if not immediately attended to.

What I found particularly interesting was this latter somewhat peculiar ""scenario"", as Devereaux terms it.  Think about why he does it in just the way he does it.  Then think about Mason's initial reaction and his likely later reaction, after he's had a little more time to think about it.  The questions the audience should ask itself, both about the plot and about the inner thoughts and emotions of the characters, the parts which they do not reveal in speech or sometimes even visible or honest emotion, are what make the film better than the run-of-the-mill action film.

Of course one good actor cannot make a good movie.  It also takes an interesting script, interesting dialog, good directing, a good supporting cast, and hopefully interesting, or at least well-done cinematography.  I think the quality of these other aspects put November Man above Brosnan's later Bond films, and more in the same field as Goldeneye, a film which both critics and audiences in general viewed pretty favorably.

I didn't see much that interested me in the ""bonus features"" on the Blu-Ray, but if nothing else there is the often-useful subtitling, should one opt to use it, and the picture quality was quite good.  Some viewers may have become impatient toward the end, as the final scene between Brosnan and the ""bad guys"" seemed somewhat like a sprinter running out of gas near the finish line, rather than bursting into his fastest pace.  Fortunately this does not take up much time anyhow.  Other requisite comments: the language, compared to typical action films is clearly tame on vulgarities.  There is no significant nudity, though there are implied sexual scenes (including one implied rape).  There's plenty of gunfire, killings, punchings, and a few mandatory explosions, but again, for an action movie this is not a very gory film either.  In short, although it's rated R it's a rather tame R.  I probably winced more at ""Hunger Games"", for example.

Bottom line: enjoyable movie

I find it a little hard to say this was Brosnan's BEST movie, because I liked his Bond films, as well as The Thomas Crown Affair.",1422748800,,4705,4.794299876084263

I think my first problem was that it was hard to follow. Slavic names do not help.

But the depth of gore took it deep into man's land and it never came back. I just don't need to see all that---it could win an award for all the blood from all the places blood can come. It gushes and explodes and it's disturbing.  Not for me.

Once you get into child rape, you don't have me any longer.  I want films to be rated for rape. Not interested. I think they(and he) picked the wrong lead for this film---he appeals to women and this film did not.

It certainly delivers as pure action, but the script is all over the place. For one, the trailers were kind of misleading. It sets up the film as this ""teacher vs. student"" thing when the actual plot is a lot more messy and convoluted. It's also stuffed with tropes and cliches that we've seen dozens of times before in spy action movies such as this one. Without spoiling anything it goes without saying that there are plenty of twists and turns, but none that you won't see well before they are actually revealed. There's also the mainstay of the CIA (much like its real-world counterpart) meddling in international affairs. It's all very entertaining on a surface level and as escapist fantasy, but it all falls apart when put under some scrutiny. The bottom line is that, despite being very watchable, it makes very little sense. That being said, Brosnan hasn't been this good in a while and for most action fans wanting to see him kick some butt, this movie will do just fine.

As an intelligence officer, Peter Devereaux (Brosnan) had seen and done plenty. He was also a CIA trainer. That he gets pulled back into the game he had retired from and ends up getting blown on a critical mission in Russia, only to have his former protg, David Mason (played by Luke Bracey) chasing after him is a good premise. Unfortunately for Devereaux, Mason discovers his former trainer's secret, his only real weakness, and that is definitely used against him. Olga Kurylenko (from 007's Quantum of Solace) portrays Alice Fournier/Mira Filipova, a woman with a past that certain people want to know more about, or eliminate, such as Alexa, a highly-skilled Russian assassin (Amila Terzimehic).

There was actually an intriguing story with a lot of twists and turns that neither of expected.  The action is great, but it was the fast-paced intricate story line is what made it a great movie.

Pierce Brosnan has said that he wanted his incarnation of James Bond to be harder edged (which they have done to an extent with Daniel Craig), and this film displays just what an opportunity they missed in not giving him his request. Well plotted, action packed, and solidly paced, this film delivers the kind of espionage thriller that keeps one on the edge of the seat. Strong performances by Brosnan, Olga Kurylenko, Luke Bracey, and the rest of the cast are consistently engaging, and the twists and turns genuinely surprised this viewer. It's a shame this film didn't fare better at the box office, as it could have been the beginning of an excellent series. As it stands alone, ""November Man"" is, in my opinion, an exceptional spy thriller well worth the investment.",1420243200,,798,4.748201438848921
6699113,4,B00O1D37NO,"Based on Bill Granger's book ""There Are No Spies' and adapted for the screen by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek, THE NOVEMBER MAN has all the ingredients for a James Bondesque adventure film - even using a previous Bon (Pierce Brosnan) as the lead character. Roger Donaldson directs and at times confusing mlange of events but in the end the film lives up to the standards of foreign intrigue thriller.

The cast is an international one and everyone fills the duties assigned to a T. Of special note is new Australian hunk Luke Bracey (who needs to hit the gym....), a welcome newcomer for the secondary lead roles that result in stardom.

Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a former CIA super spy, retired. He worked for the CIA and trained David Mason (Luke Bracey). Peter is asked by the man he worked for to extract a woman (Olga Kurylenko) who is in Russia and is presently close to a man Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski) running for President, who is believed to have committed crimes during the Chechen war. She can give them the name of someone who can prove it. His friend says that she will only come to him. So he goes and she gets the info and tries to get out but the man finds out and tries to stop her. Peter arrives and saves her but as they are getting away they're shot at. She is killed but tells Peter the name before she dies. Peter kills the men who attacked them but when he sees the leader, Mason (Luke Bracey), a man he trained, he realizes the CIA is involved. He tries to find the person and the only one who might know where she is is Alice Fournier, the social worker who helped her when she came to the West. A CIA bigwig (Bill Smitrovich) steps in and orders that Devereaux be taken off the case and wants Mason to take care of it. The Presidential candidate sends an assassin to make sure no one wrecks his chances of becoming President. Devereaux finds Alice and tries to protect her while trying to find the mole.

The film spreads over time frames and many gorgeous European cities and keeps a breathtaking pace, delivering a spy film that should please all who love this genre. Grady Harp, January 15",1420243200,,2137,4.446428571428571

6699130,3,B00O1D37NO,"The November Man is a pretty good spy thriller with a healthy dose of action.  It's nice not to be sure who Devereux can totally trust.  There are a couple twists that, while not shocking in the least, add a little extra flavor into the just-above-mediocre plot.  The movie will keep your interest, but nothing fantastic occurs.  No stand-out characters here.  Relationships and characterizations are superficial.  It's no Die Hard or The Equalizer.

While trying not to spoil the plot by being specific, I have to point out one annoying casting flaw that gets confusing.  An actress and the girl playing her in flashbacks look NOTHING alike.  I'm talking about a pretty major character here.

This was a stupid flaw.  Like casting January Jones as the adult version of Miley Cyrus.  The flaw is made worse by the fact that a female assassin who pops up later looks MUCH MORE like the girl.  Confusing.  Then, as if to make us laugh, later we meet the daughter of a major character in the film who ALSO looks more like the girl from the past.

6699159,2,B00O1D37NO,"""November Man"" is a spy film that sporadically keeps the yawn factor up with weighty dialogue and disjointed scenes.. A film should not be dependent upon the main star to carry it and such is the case here. Pierce Brosan holds the movie together as a CIA agent that develops a nagging friendship problem. The Euro backdrop is an attention grabber but the Russian/Chetzian talk and hazy war references don't add to the film. Granted the film is dependent upon those elements but it has a forced feel. The cinematography is excellent and once the viewer understands the nature of the film after a tiresome sendoff, some enjoyment can be attained .
Brosnan has effectively dropped the suave Bond persona and gives us a much rougher spy alternative to root for. The film is filled with beautiful women, not only the key actresses but the bystanders in the streets. There is an artful emphasis on women's breasts from a physiological and verbal standpoint, and personally I appreciate such things if it's not done for bawdiness reasons only.

""November Man "" contains some well done action scenes and is heavy on firearms usage. The movie will hold a thinking persons interest but unfortunately weighs itself down with heavy handed pseudo geopolitical jargon. The acting tended toward the weak end at times especially a bald headed character named Hanley played by Bill Smitrovich. Absolutely horrible and straight out of a McGuiver episode. The film is devoid of any levity which doesn't help as well. Not an awful film and worth a watch for the action and scenery. The dvd picture quality is top notch.",1420070400,,1599,4.8786764705882355

This isn't a James Bond knockoff its a great espionage story on its own but it's great to see Pierce in that genre again. Great story great action and really terrific acting. If you loved him as Bond you'll love this although he's a bit older cynical and vicious. The other lead is played by Luke Bracey a relatively new Australian who does a really good job opposite Brosnan. Then there's the very underrated Olga Kurylenko, she's gorgeous but she's got some serious acting chops as well.

No crazy camera work, some car chases that seem more realistic than commonly seen in most recent action thrillers, only a pair of unbelievable fight scenes. Overall, nice touches of tradecraft, redirection, doublecrossing, triple-bluffing, and other hi-jinks worthy of your time if you like this sort of thing. I personally appreciated the female assassin who didn't take off her clothes, but went about her business as a cold-blooded killer like a pro. I also liked that the female characters were more developed than often is the case in this genre. Very little gore - the violence is real-life in its representation. The plot will keep you thinking to try and keep up with the twists, but it's not going to blow your mind, it's just going to do a nice job entertaining you.

In a movie that reminds me of a Bond movie or the Bourne movie series and although it lacks a bit of originality in storyline, it does have a pretty decent story and plenty of action.

The only upside was the cast... all strong (and international) with good chemistry between the leads (I swear, though, Pierce Brosnan could generate heat with practically anybody).

Overstuffed with hackneyed Hollywood storyline and plot devices, this baby is a real stinker. Pierce Bronsnan's character, Devereaux, is ex-CIA, and is called back to ostensibly perform a mission for what turns out to be a deeply corrupted agency. So, once again we must endure the worn out storyline of a powerful, corrupt, out-of-control CIA. The screenwriter flipped a coin and it was between a corrupt CIA or a corrupt big Pharmaceutical company.  The CIA won the coin toss.

Olga Kurylenko  plays Alice, a near identical redux of her role in the poorly received James Bond film, ""Quantum of Solace"".

We are all familiar with, and tolerant of, the fact that in action films like this the police are kept at a distance. The protagonist and antagonist shoot up a city and only as the scene is fading does one hear police sirens in the background - the police finally on the way to check out why buildings have been blown up, automobiles smashed, and dozens or corpses are scattered around. In this film, the police are non-existent in airports, city streets; hotels; everywhere. I guess were supposed to believe that since the film is set in Russia, law and order are not established. Someone might tell ex-secret police enforcer Vladimir Putin that he rules over a lawless nation.

Most incredibly, in one scene, protagonist Devereaux terrorizes an innocent civilian woman with a gun and knife and then mutilates her - an act that would typically be reserved for the antagonist. This is certainly a novel, not hackneyed, plot device, but if in order to be novel, you have to have, say, Mary Poppins get raped by the hero in your film to be unique, then I'd say there is something amiss, wouldn't you?",1419206400,3,1786,4.763754045307444

This film had great potential, but couldn't decide what kind of film this was going to be. It is a film about torture, rape, secrecy, the CIA,Russia and double agents.

The film opens as a Government assassin Peter Devereaux, played by Pierce Brosnan, shouts at his his trainee, David Mason, played by Luke Bracey, for disobeying orders and ended up causing a child's death. It seems this incident caused Devereaux to leave the CIA. Five years later, Devereaux is asked to go on one more mission to rescue an old love. At the sane time a Russian assassin for hire is looking for the same woman to lead her to another young woman who knows state's secrets. And, the CIA is up to no good, there us a double agent in the mix. Confused yet?

Pierce Brosnan Kees the film alive, but I found myself fast forwarding over many boring parts. Will Devereaux's ex-trainee find him and kill him or will Devereaux find him first? Who is the mole, and why do we care?

The film lags in areas most notably that of explaining the amount of training Brosnans character provided his younger counter who is now tasked with hunting him down. However the action is slick but believable(unlike the ridiculous stunts in Brosnan's last Bond outing) and there is a brutal edge to Brosnan's character which was somewhat lacking in his performances as 007.

The ""they killed my girl"" and the ""younger guy is after me"" components are definitely there.

I enjoyed the movie and there was plenty of action to keep me awake throughout.  I am 47 and long ago stopped imagining that I could be the character in a movie, so staying awake for the whole thing on a comfy couch, with food and drink, regardless of the time of day or night, gives it three stars right off the bat.

6700272,3,B00O1D37NO,"YES! An action film not based on a video game, and an action film with no cgi fx. Add two believable plot twists before it's done, and that's the package that made this spy vs spy vs The Whole Damned World adventure entertaining enough.

Brosnan gets it all note-perfect, for those who see, and don't look away from the absolute irony of an aging spy, long since retired, ""pulled back in"" as Pacino's Godfather III character repeats, but generally without the Corleone entourage of servitors and assassins. So I found myself groaning in sympathy during one of many scenes where,  ambushed again, Brosnan puts his pretty much past-it, wiry body in the way of Many Bad Things.

While I was watching I realized it's not unusual to see actors early in their careers doing the physical work themselves, taking hard chances; that's a traditional publicity angle in film promotion, anyway. Brosnan doesn't seem to have had Botox or eye lifts and the absence of plastic surgery probably made me more willing to believe the former 007 was taking on the full ration of rough ordeals handed out non-stop. It's a kind of coherence. Results: movie magic or not, we get to see exactly what it costs to be dragged back into the life when you're 20-odd years beyond your best days. You do see Brosnan apparently having some trouble running, generally looking like he is about to be ambulance fodder in the very next stairwell or underground parking lot.

The fearlessness in this greying spy guy with fading chops whose every thought is crammed with desperate workarounds and counter-strategies is a bit endearing but fortunately for us, never allowed by the director to descend into sappiness or pity.

Side Note: Brosnan, though not my favorite Bond, has a particular tired middle aged beauty I don't think we're ever allowed to see develop in women in starring roles. Women mostly age out of leading roles before Brosnan's age. Typically women at this age in Hollywood are only allowed to play crazy grannies in dark glasses. It's not fair, and it's not real. So that's one more reason to watch THE NOVEMBER MAN: to look closely at a small dose of chrono-realism the American mainstream film industry permits only rarely.

Brosnan's  tired, greying ex-spy thrown back into the bloody chum of international intrigue shows the physical cost of playing The Great Game, and what you might have to do  when you're finally out of options. While not a geezer movie, like the Marigold Hotel,say,  it's likely this mostly believable, no-options/no-exit story was crafted precisely for the generation X people now in their 50s who recall Brosnan's Bondian sleekness of the long ago.

As it turns out, interesting and outrageous things do happen when the spy  can't run that fast or get decent backup by dialing Q or the Mission Impossible team complete with its array of tech wizardry. In the world of action films and movies in general, anything approaching this near-honesty as delivered by Piers Brosnan in THE NOVEMBER MAN is certainly worth a watch.",1418083200,8,3031,4.877431906614786

6700275,3,B00O1D37NO,"I always thought Pierce Brosnan did a credible job as James Bond and hence was willing to give this movie a shot based on the fact that he stared in it. A bit of a set piece as far as the plot goes, a bit coarser than it needed to be to carry the action, and trying just a smidgen too hard to be clever. However, still a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The action sequences were well done. But, although the primary character was supposed to be a retired CIA agent, Mr. Brosnan couldn't quite make his American accent play. Three stars because I liked the fact that the movie used quite a few little-known central European actors.",1418083200,4,639,4.245901639344262

6700323,4,B00O1D37NO,"Way better than anticipated. Hated Brosnan as Bond, but he has an edge here that offsets the fairly generic plot. He is becoming a more interesting actor. Less smirk, more unpredictable goes a long way.

The leading girl is decent and genuinely beautiful, though only an idiot wouldn't guess that she's the maguffin. The handsome young protege is just ok. I've seen some raves about his work, but I didn't see anything special in him. The B story about a female Russian assassin is just generic, though the way she meets her fate is pretty sweet.

Donaldson is a decent, probably under-rated director. Gets it done. Brosnan is the executive producer and of course has worked with Donaldson before, so the character has some dimension and room to breath.

The problem is that, for a major motion picture, there isn't any more intrigue or plot than an average episode of ""Covert Affairs"". There is just not enough plot here to make it worth the high cost of going to a theater. For the home screen, it's an okay time waster. The script is so by the numbers that anyone who has ever seen a movie before, or an episode of ""Murder She Wrote"", will spot the real villain the moment that character appears on the screen. That and the other big ""surprise"", the identity of the character everyone is searching for, are pretty obvious - so obvious it is hard to believe our very experienced hero didn't spot it along with the audience. The script is also something of a cheat, laying no foreshadowing for the revelation in the last third of Devereaux's weak spot. Always fun to watch Brosnan, though",1417910400,,880,4.540880503144654

I cannot recommend it much, however, and am sorry I wasted my money on Amazon to stream it.  I would strongly recommend waiting for it to come out on Prime or Netflix or something before throwing your money away.  It's just very, very predictable and ho-hum, in spite of all of the action.  We've all seen this stuff a thousand times and I wouldn't mind it so much if it just had some spark here or there of some semblance of originality, but it just doesn't.  It's all so over-the-top and so unbelievable that it just refused to allow me to suspend my disbelief.  Brosnan does okay in his usual role as bad-ass Bourne wannabe tough guy, but unlike the Bourne flics, November Man lacks the script and any real reason for being made in the first place other than an easy money clone.  I will say this:  November Man is not totally unwatchable. I will probably even watch it again should it ever become available on Prime or through Netflix streaming or perhaps on a late night channel of something.

Brosnan, as a hard-as-nails cold war assassin (Retired) gets pulled back in to help save and extract a former partner.  What unfolds is an amazing series of complex twists, turns, actions and emotions that leave the viewer asking ""how far ahead must I look?""

6700650,5,B00O1D37NO,"Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a successful CIA operative because of his work ethic of cool detachment and efficiency.  He retires from the agency after a botched assignment caused by a green prot&eacute;g&eacute; David Mason (Luke Bracey).  Five years later he's called back for a mission which entails safely delivering an aide to an ambitious Russian politician with a dark past who cares nothing about eliminating any incriminating threads.  This assignment is personal to Devereaux and he finds himself in a cat and mouse game involving Mason, the politician, and the bosses at Langley.  This is probably among the best work Brosnan has ever done.  His Devereaux is not just an assassin but a man of great complexity.  Devereaux is not only forced to examine what it means to be a spy but also what the costs are for his choice and Brosnan ably demonstrates the multiple facets of the character.  Director Roger Donaldson expertly juggles the action as well as the dramatic elements of the film.  The film whizzes by at a breakneck pace and there are many red herrings designed to force the audience to rethink previous assumptions.

Though Pierce Brosnan most certainly makes liberal use of stunt doubles due to insurance restrictions and his advanced age, he has that rare determined assuredness that aids in my suspension of disbelief,compelling me to think he's the real deal.  This is the best action film I've seen him in since Goldeneye, which is, in my opinion, among the top Bond movies.  The first act of The November Man is rather conventional, but the second introduces some interesting sub-plots and complexity.  The third act ratchets up the tension to the point that I am convinced that there is some thought  and dramatic structure behind all the gun fire and flying bodies, making this drama a cut or two above most action films.

Is any place in the world (besides a war zone) so lawless that one can smash or blow up any number of cars, destroy hotels and homes, take dozens of lives while pedestrians continue to sip coffee and no one notices? No one posts their cell phone photos to the web, or tries to intervene?  And how does the CIA deploy a drone over a foreign government's parliament and nobody notices?

OK, OK, dinky little green weenie European roads can't handle a honking F250 or a Crew Cab Silverado or a Dodge Ram, but a sissy little Porsche convertible?  How about, at least, a Toyota Land Cruiser?  With mudder treads?  And what's with the ""intrepid New York Times reporter?""  Haven't you producer geniuses yet grasped that a) newspapers are fast growing obsolete, and b) the New York Times is a dying mastodon...hell, its principals had to borrow cash from some Mexican billionaire, just to keep their weird, KGB-style office building in NYC.  No American lender would touch it.  American lenders are a tad too smart to collateralize loans with half-dead dinosaurs.  Mr B is aging well, and he's running on all eight herewith.  This is a brisk, tough show, very well-shot shot (a brief round of applause for the camera guys, always for the camera guys, long may they run).  Mr Brosnan portrays, like real good, a cagey, deadly, and altogether classy dude, is supported by some fine, younger pros, especially a Russian actress playing this lethal hit-chick with a patina of sociopathic creepiness that sure worked for me.  Ultimately, Miss Bad ass, shall we say, is quelled, in fine fashion, during just one of the several crackerjack chase/suspense scenes.  The November Man does not seem to set out proving anything much more than:  there's a helluva lot of us out there who like this stuff, and most of us are well-reasoned adults (thank you, very much) who, it's more than plausible for my money, will enjoy this little gem as much as Yours Truly.",1417132800,,1716,4.8719723183391
6701123,4,B00O1D37NO,"No need to cover the plot, others have done so, besides it is a spy action thriller, enough said.  It has good acting, a reasonably plausible plot, and an excellent pacing of action vs character/plot development.  Everything we need to know about each character's background and motivation is delivered via flashbacks and dialogue exactly when we need the information. There are no ridiculous action sequences (e.g., see the last Die Hard movie), explosions, and implausible special effects. Apart from one gratuitous bedroom scene there was nothing unneeded or out of place.

My one criticism is that the local constabulary never show up, no matter how long the protagonists have been running around with guns showing, guns blazing, and with dead bodies all over the place. In summary, this is well crafted movie that I will watch again when available on cable.

After one unnecessary death too many at the hands of his protege, Devereaux packs it in, only to be recalled for one last mission pulling a former colleague out of Moscow. The colleague knows something about the next president of Russia, but it seems that Devereaux has been called back to action as part of someone else's deeper game, and it isn't clear to Devereaux or the viewer who Devereaux can trust.

The wheels move within wheels, and you need to have a flow chart to figure out who means what to whom. There is even a Russian assassin chopping her way through everyone, and Devereaux's protege turns up eager to show his former mentor that he is now the master. Eventually, the pieces come together, but it was something of a mess getting there.  Also, Brosnan's Devereaux seems to work on being unlikable, which doesn't make for an engaging central character.

Characters facing and living through unbelievable ordeals with no emotional impact).  And let's not forget high ranking government officials guarded in hotels by only 6 body guards, all of whom are more than willing to let a sexy woman enter the official's private suite with nothing more than her word that she was sent for, and those same guards easily overtaken by one gunman.
