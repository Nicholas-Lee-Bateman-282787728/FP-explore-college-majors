8326093,5,B00144JBVK,"Very Good quality movies, sound & picture are great.  If you love the East Side Kids and need these movies, get them-you will not be disappointed.  V1 in this series is priced at $49+: that is ridiculous.  I think this series had 4, maybe up to 6 volumes/sets.  Would love to see a complete East Side Kids set, like the complete Bowery Boys set of dvds that are out.",1447286400,,366,4.260869565217392
