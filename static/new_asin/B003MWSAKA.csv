Our 9 yr old Grandson loved it.  Great Si-Fi thriller as long as an adult is around, there are some rather spooky spots in the movie but very enjoyable.",1302739200,,327,7.837837837837838
4156285,3,B003MWSAKA,"Most of the necessary ingredients were there so this should have been a successful film.  Billed as a Sci-Fi/Adventure, this 2009 New Zealand production though, is anything but successful.  Fantastic special effects aside, the story feels incomplete, the pacing is odd, the sense of urgency slips from time to time with unnecessary distractions, the dialog was everything except informative, and the acting uniformly dull (Sam Neil in particular looked as if he wanted to be somewhere else doing anything but this movie.).  The only element that worked was the spooky shape shifters living next door.  If the rest of the movie had managed to capitalize on that instead of splintering off into a lackluster teen angst movie of the week this might have worked.  Instead, with too many things that didn't make sense, this movie just drifted from one inexplicable scene to another: the `split' of the twins was arbitrary and forced, the sequence in the police station useless, why did the aunt and uncle keep disappearing?  In addition, some of the reactions to danger were obscenely ludicrous (who, upon hearing their neighbors want to kill them, just go to bed.  Or, while your front door is being broken down, just stand there and watch until the intruder is upon you!?).  Crazy.  What a waste.

I will add that I'm glad I watched it, but it's not a keeper.",1298851200,10,1356,4.882096069868996

Unbeknownst to them, living nearby in a creepy old house are the Wilberforces ,shapeshifting creatures that are set out to destroy them. The twins meet up with a mysterious older man named Mr. Jones,who shows them they both have unique powers that help defeat the Wilberforces before they try to end the world.",1290902400,3,484,4.705882352941177
4156287,5,B003MWSAKA,"I feel this movie certainly deserves a 5 Star rating. I saw this movie through a rental place first and thought how thrilling it was, and done very well.
I wanted to buy it, and came here to find it at Amazon and at that time the movie was only given a couple of... not so nice reviews and because of these two reviews this movie comes across as not worth the time to watch or even own.
Well, everyone sees things differently. Thanks for the great review from the man in Wa and his 5 Stars. I decided to write also. My first time ever for any review.
I found this movie to be a real exciting adventure and yes, a little bit slow at first. The kids acting was great. If you really like a good Science Fiction type movie, I think you will also enjoy this movie.
Kind of creepy and fun. Not for little kids though.
Go for it!!!",1285977600,9,824,4.061349693251533
4156288,5,B003MWSAKA,"This is a terrific movie, with great performances from its young stars.  The writing and direction really brought out the best in them.  What's more, the world the story portrays is great fun and a little scary.

Highly recommended.  It's good stuff.",1284076800,11,250,4.880952380952381
4156289,1,B003MWSAKA,"I wish there had been reviews before I bought this movie.  I didn't like it, my children didn't like it and my grandkids didn't like it, what more can you say, it was pretty stupid.  What a waste of money!",1282089600,5,205,4.1
4156290,2,B003MWSAKA,"I was completely un-entertained while watching this movie. The movie starts out slow, continues slow, and at the end, was very anticlimactic. The entire movie is about one boy who has a chip on his shoulder (attitude problem) until the last 10-15 minutes of the film. His cousin is more level headed but although it is not poorly acted, was just unentertaining.
I expected more from an accomplished actor like Sam Neill.
Truly, you will spend the entire film thinking, ""get on with it!"" then at the very end, in a rushed fashion, our heroes somehow save the day and a few special effects are thrown in.
I do not recommend this film to buy or even rent. Unless your a huge New Zealand fan. The opening credits appeared to be all by low budget, NZ promos. If a specific region is going to make a movie, don't make all the advertising, trailers, etc for your people only. If you want your movie liked on an international level, you have to appeal to more than one demographic.",1281484800,10,973,4.502824858757062

the dvd plays great. The case showed no damage.
How is the movie? If you are looking for a safe to watch family movie and enjoy this type of magickal story, I reccomend it. Its not a film we watch alot, but it was worth the small price that it sold for",1407888000,,304,4.0
4156299,5,B003MWSAKA,"If you aren't familiar with New Zealand film making, this would be a great way to introduce yourself to it.  It does have a well known American actor as one of the main characters, but don't watch it for that.  It has a decent story line, with likable characters that make you want to root for them.  It does bounce around a little in some spots, so you really have to watch it or you will get lost...maybe they had to edit it for time.  All in all, it is worth a look, especially if you are into sci-fi movies.  It can be a little scary for the younger viewers, so keep that in mind as well.",1404518400,,592,4.0256410256410255

4156303,3,B003MWSAKA,"I have memories of watching the original series back in 1981 when I was just a child (~8 yrs), and what fascinated me the most was the tunnels the giant slugs used to travel from under their home.  These memories have stuck with me for decades.  After rediscovering  the original 'Under the Mountain"" series and watching it in its entirety on youtube, I just had to watch this latest rendition.  This version was definitely worth watching, and had some interesting twists as compared to the original.  I haven't read the book to determine which one is more accurate.  However, given all the additional special effects in this version, it could have spent more time in the tunnels and showed the slugs travelling through, to better capture some of the essence of the original.  If these original memories of mine hadn't persisted so well, I may have felt differently.  Overall, worth watching, but not an improvement over the original series.",1356739200,,941,4.8742138364779874
4156304,5,B003MWSAKA,"I own up to having a family connection to Rangitoto (for overseas viewers, that's the volcano in Auckland's Waitemata Harbour that takes a central role in the movie) and that might make me a little biased.  But my 12 year old daughter and I loved this movie, and I can't find a single fault with it.  The pace, the plot, the acting, all sit together perfectly.  Well done to cast and crew.  We'll be watching it again.  And thanks to Maurice Gee for the novel that it's based on.",1350691200,,479,4.337078651685394

We could not watch more than 20 minutes or so and struggled through them.  We even skipped watched it thinking it might get better further into the movie.  It didn't.  Total waste of our time.  Sci-fi/slimy monster buffs, hope it has meaning for you.",1339804800,,398,4.535211267605634
4156306,1,B003MWSAKA,"The title says it all, (Pollution of the mind) do yourself a favour, don't encourage the film industry to make more rubbish like this. Absolute Garbage!!!!",1328572800,,155,5.0
4156307,4,B003MWSAKA,"While I haven't read Mark Gee's original novel or seen the 1981 TV serial, research indicates that Jonathan King's feature version of UNDER THE MOUNTAIN has altered elements of the story to make it more Lovecraftian than the original. The Wilberforces (the evil aliens) in the TV version are slug-like. Here, they are masses of writhing tentacles on a human frame. The concept of the main malevolent creatures slumbering under mountains and at the bottom of the lake, awaiting their followers to open a mystical door that will unleash them on our world is also very Lovecraftian. The glimpse of one of these creatures sleeping in a mountain cave could easily be Cthulhu itself! The glowing stones the twins to battle the Wilberforces remind me of August Derleth's invention of the star-stones. Then there is the blurring of science fictional ideas with the supernatural. Again, it is Lovecraftian in approach.

I am inclined to agree with MadMac's review on the on the one point that the twins Theo and Rachel would have served the story better if they had been younger, instead of teens. In fact, the twins in the TV version are 11 years old. Still I can't fault the performances of Tom Cameron and Sophie McBride.

Sam Neil is very good in this type of role as an authoritative mysterious, benevolent alien/sorcerer. His presence is one of the things that lured me to seek this film out.

I have to side with those reviewers who enjoyed the film. It is moody and mysterious. The story builds at a steady pace and erupts into a satisfying climax. The Wilberforces and their masters are unsettling but NOT overly gross. There is really no gore to speak of or large body count. If director Jonathan King was in fact shooting for a Lovecraftian film the whole family could watch, this is it. I think it works on that level.

I caught film on one of the premium movie channels, but I do plan to purchase a copy of it.",1327276800,5,1914,4.653846153846154
4156308,5,B003MWSAKA,I loved the movie. Special affects and mystery was all grand. I watched it twice in a roll and a week later watched it again. I purchased the movie and added it to my collection of 250 movies.,1313020800,,192,4.078947368421052
4156309,3,B003MWSAKA,"This film while having some of the same ideas as the original series/book sadly departed from the greatness that made it (the original) a good show/book. Yes i understand that in order to take a 7ish 8ish part series and boil it down to the dregs of ""what is needed to tell the story"" would ruin some of the magic of the whole thing...but they could have left a lot of it there and not changed the whole thing with added monsters in the whole mix. But guess that needed to be added in to ""explain"" more of the idea then they could..idk. The movie was good but left me wanting to see the original again.",1308873600,2,602,4.198275862068965
4156310,2,B003MWSAKA,"I can't tell you how disappointed I was viewing 'Under The Mountain'.

Sam Neill, at least for the most part, has been a given winner the past few decades. He's been involved with very few duds, so I treat him like Apple stock, a blue chip given.

However, not everything he touches is golden - this being a clear example.

'Mountain' has the hallmarks of a quality film - the cinematography, set design and special effects are equal to anything produced out of Hollywood. And utilizing the stunning wonder of New Zealand is, as always, breathtakingly beautiful. I also appreciated how the writers engineered the natural history of The Land Of The Kiwis into the story.

But this horror-mystical-scifi thriller falls short on so many levels.

There are three reasons I think this failed.

First, because this flick doesn't know what it wants to be - it's a production in desperate need of an identity. It touches with and hints at several types of films, but because it only toys with each idea, there's never a full commitment by the director as to what he wants to deliver to us, the audience. Therefore, we never know how to engage the story. It doesn't help that plot-holes abound.

Once heard a funny and very revealing observation about the creative process that kept running in the back of my mind while watching this production. The late Alexander Godunov played a wonderful character in the film 'The Money Pit'. Frustrated watching the ineptitude of a workman repeatedly dabbing paint onto an unfinished doorway, he snatches the brush away and says, ""Up...down. Up...down. Paint. Don't tickle.""

Truer words have never been spoken about any creative endeavor.

Secondly, I think this might've worked if the two leads were much younger. The story is childish and so it makes sense that this should've been a children's film. As I think back, I can see this being much more enjoyable if Theo and Rachel were, say, 10 years old. The magic of youth allows for a much greater stretch of the imagination. As young adults, this feels so much more hokey and outright silly.

And finally, there's something not quite right about the two young actors who play the leads. I'm not sure if it's a directional failure or if it's that these two just can't convey and project. But there's something undefined in their performance; it's empty. We don't feel anything for them because they're reading lines from the script, not living their roles.

Director Jonathan King needed a stronger and more focused vision long before he put images to film. He wasted such amazing talent and creative production for this disappointing product.",1306972800,4,2626,4.852348993288591

8400534,5,B003MWSAKA,"This film is good fun and well made for those who like the fantasy film genre. We really enjoyed the evening watching it.

One of the themes I enjoyed were of course the Lovecraft references, which another viewer brought up. This was at times done with sly humor, such as in the scene with the cute little Cthulhu dangling from the rear view mirror.

It has a strong twins theme, which is developed in some unique ways -- one character is from a planet where everyone is a twin. The twins can communicate in nonverbal ways but there is also a rejection/running on the part of one of them. It deals with the total aloneness of twinless twins.

The other theme I enjoyed were the earth shaking giants stored beneath mountains, trying to get out. This is often how earthquakes are explained in legends and myths. Some malevolence is trapped deep in the earth and at times bangs around in rage, trying to escape and wreak havoc. An example is the great fiery serpent that dove into the center of earth in Zarathustrian writings. Maybe the Maori believe something similar, with the Rainbow Serpent. Don't expect a rainbow at the end of that tunnel though.

Adorable teens. Five stars.",1445558400,,1179,4.626794258373206
