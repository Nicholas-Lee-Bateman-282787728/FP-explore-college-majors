8045199,4,B00076YP0S,"This is a review of Act II only.  Every year I show college sophomores the scene in hell as part of a music history survey.  They are a very critical group who don't let anything shoddy pass without derision. I thought I'd try this production and see if it might challenge the one I have used for years, Glyndebourne's with Janet Baker as Orfeo.  Well, as the previous reviewer stated, Bernadette Manca Di Nissa's singing is lovely.  But, alas, no subtitles.  And this live performance has a bit more than usual amount of stages noises (tho the audience isn't overly obtrusive).  The production is OK.  The chorus stands above and around the back of the stage highlighted by blue-lights (I don't think Gluck would be happy having them just stand and sing).  The producer, it seems, took ""larve"" in its English meaning instead of ""specters"" as it should be, because the most frequently seen adversaries are naked men in Sumo wrestler thongs writhing in a half shell :-)  Their cheap bald head caps prove that this scene would be much more acceptable if observed/filmed from a distance.  Credit is due, however, for the use of some actual dance (the score says dance!).  Peter Hall for Glyndebourne apparently felt that a couple of hand-stands would suffice.  Musically, the San Carlo forces are fine, although I think Leppard's trombones are more prominent in those powerful diminished seventh chords.  I'd give Act II of this performance a solid B, or even a B+ if you know the libretto well enough.  But I'll be sticking with Dame Janet and let the class laugh when Glyndebourne's flimsy gates of hell start wobbling.",1484352000,2,1618,4.794223826714801

8045201,3,B00076YP0S,"This edition does not have subtitles, is in 16:9 letterbox, has Dolby 5.1 sound.  Decent vocal and orchestral performance, bright video, and clear sound alleviate what some viewers may find a static, tedious production that emphasizes dancers' writhing bodies.  Not all that much ""expressive truth"" here.",1134259200,10,304,5.586956521739131
