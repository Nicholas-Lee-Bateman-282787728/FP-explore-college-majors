2555086,3,B000F9JPTI,The disc I received is not the one pictured.  I will keep it because it has some of the episodes that I don't have from Disc set 1,1231200000,,130,3.642857142857143
2555087,3,B000F9JPTI,"... including the lousy reception with ""rabbit ears.""  These are degraded recordings carelessly transferred to DVD; but all the pirates, smugglers, spies, and con-men are there, just like I (sort of) remember them.  This is all that seems to be left of a great series.  Pity.",1214352000,13,275,4.934782608695652
2555088,1,B000F9JPTI,"I purchased the 3 volumes of Cd's and they are terrible!  Not viewable!
My requests for returns/exchanges went ignored!  Don't buy these.  You'll  be ripped off.",1213056000,17,161,5.076923076923077
2555089,4,B000F9JPTI,"these are b+w with video quality poor at times, but audio stays ok. lovely haunting score (you'll know it when you hear it,if you're over 11) gorgeous man, he wasn't an actor, which is why he seems real and natural and everyone else seems to be overacting.  he just died a couple of years ago. he did much besides the TV show and comes from an interesting family with a long history of sea-faring. google him. one of the websites on him has a gallery of pix of him and clips of the theme music. he's my desktop wallpaper! that brooding face, the south sea scenery, the music, and the concept, which is a guy starting his own business, shipping cargo between islands, his own boss, his own boat is his home, freedom.  most of the plots are silly, but it had a mystique about it that has boomers in several countries blogging about it 50 years later, men and women alike. if you miss him,  these are worth having.  but i'm not buying more untill they make better copies, remaster, or whatever they do.  there'l be quite a market for them. The one I have is season 2. I loved watching it.",1188000000,28,1085,4.325123152709359

8119165,5,B000F9JPTI,I have all three volumes now but half of the original adventures are missing. We need to get the film industry to release the remaining episodes.,1436054400,,145,4.615384615384615
8119166,3,B000F9JPTI,"This was marvellous series. As others have mentioned it inspired many young people to visit the pacific and harbour thoughts of an adventurous life in the footsteps of Adam Troy. Now of course with aqe and a little wisdom one can see how the stories are based on the values and ideas of that era and all the cultural and gender specific stereotypes of the time. Nevertheless seeing it again a half century later brings back a little of the magic of boyhood.

PS the DVD box, attractively pictured was broken when it arrived but DVD's all intact thankfully.",1390262400,,556,4.616161616161616
8119167,1,B000F9JPTI,"I looked forward to seeing this show again. When it was new I loved its exotic locations, sailing scenes and the beauty of the schooner.

The quality of the DVD's is so low they are nat watchable. They are very granny, blured and have steaks of color gthrough parts of the black and white images.

This offering is a scam.",1388880000,,322,4.35
8119168,5,B000F9JPTI,"These are very old episodes dating back to 1959 and 1960so the quality of the reproductions is rough. But having said that, I loved getting the opportunity to see a series from when I was a teenager and never missed watching it. What a treat getting to sail aboard the Tika again with Adam Troy. If you can look past the rough quality, this series is well worth purchasing.",1371859200,,373,4.420289855072464
8119169,2,B000F9JPTI,"The quality is pitiful. I do not suggest you buy this. Fortunately, I got this volume free from a friend.

May I suggest that you go online and download the original ""Adventures In Paradise"" theme music and burn it to a disk. Then purchase Gardner McKay's ""Journey Without A Map"". While you read the book let the theme music repeat on your CD player. That's what I did and it was nice. It was fun.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Theme-Songs-Of-The-Past/dp/B002KYOTHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Theme Songs Of The Past</a>

I loved this series as much as anyone. Maybe that's why I can't stand watching it in the condition it's in.

8119170,3,B000F9JPTI,"I do have a slight memory of this series of long ago, probably because of its dreamy theme music,
and I could forgive the people who did the poor transfer no doubt because it is not alone in my large collection of 50's/60's television in this condition.
However I cannot forgive these people for not including a menu within the DVD's for easy access,
all they do is list the episodes onto the DVD so I suppose we should have to be grateful for that.",1335484800,,449,4.294117647058823
8119171,4,B000F9JPTI,"I LOVED this series when I was in high school.  It is a shame that someone didn't pick this series to remake.  The picture quality is not good--but I am so glad to see the episodes again, that I don't care. Good stories and outdoor scenes.  Much better than what is being produced today.",1293321600,3,287,4.277777777777778
8119172,2,B000F9JPTI,It was worth it to see this TV series again. I wish someone could video enhance it cause this product is quite poor video quality. Sometimes the sound is fuzzy or choppy. Could be this show was on old kinescope wire or something but don't exptect 1080 p.......(joke),1254096000,,266,4.5625
8119173,5,B000F9JPTI,"SailFish Media did a great job to send an excellent set of the old series, ""Adventures In Paradise""!  This series was thought lost for so many years and to see it on Digital Television is far better than that of reception received by television sets from T.V. stations back in the fifties and sixties.  Thank you SailFish Media for providing DVD sets for this series!",1250467200,9,367,4.630769230769231
