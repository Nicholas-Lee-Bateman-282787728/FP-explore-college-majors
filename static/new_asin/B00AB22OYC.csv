8549513,5,B00AB22OYC,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series 4, she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's childhood, as she relays bits and pieces to her DS Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. Joe, has a young family and a beautiful wife who wants the best. This causes discomfort and dissension in the family, and this is prominent in seep real of the episodes.

Series 4 as usual provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 4, a new young pathologist arrives, and he brings some needed romance and mystery. I found this series 4 to be one of the best of the 4 series. I have read test a series 5 has been ordered, David Leon will not reprise his role, so, a new DS will be introduced. Looking forward.

Beautiful locations add ambience to every frame.
The stories are moving and exciting and unlike many gory detective series out there the writers rely on good performances and solid

8549520,5,B00AB22OYC,"I fell in love with ""Vera"" in Set One.  Pessimistically, or was it realistically, I didn't think the love would last. I'm happy to report that after three sets, the honeymoon isn't over. I remain in love for a couple of reasons; the writing is brilliant and Brenda Blethyn is heavenly. It doesn't hurt that the setting of Northumberland is moody and beautiful, I can almost smell the earthy fragrance of the windswept land, nor that the supporting cast matches Blethyn's skill.

I have long loved the Brits' excellence in this genre of film and t.v. to the point where I have not followed American detective stories in many years. I understand the accents to the point where I think Americans on the telly sound funny. My love and appreciation is pretty simple; I prefer the stories they tell and the way they tell them. For these reasons the British just do it better for me. The actors look like real people look and are brilliantly believable in the roles they play. I think this is because the writing and casting is spot on. Apparently, my tastes run to their tastes. If I want crime-solving, gun-wielding, super-models I'll tune into something American. I understand why they have an audience, but they are not for me. Different strokes for different folks. Programs like Vera are what ring my bell.

I love puzzles and people are my favorite kind. I have the unfortunate tendency to analyze everything and everyone. And I can't help but do this with what I view and read. The reason I think the writers of this series are excellent is because their main character remains true to who she was created to be.  This series is about Vera. So far there has been no slippage from real, to unbelievable, to farce.  Vera is a kindred spirit to those similarly afflicted. I see her cloak of protection and I recognize it. She makes sense to me. She is damaged and marching on.

Vera is driven. I cannot help but wonder about what or who is driving driven people.  Folks aren't driven by what they are trying to accomplish; they are driven by why they want to accomplish it.  I'm not saying the end result isn't important to them, that has to be a given but the why behind it is what fascinates me. I know what is driving Vera, the writers wisely lets the viewer in, little by little, on her reasons. It is real and personal to me. The fact that I ""approve"" of Vera's goals keeps me watching the series.  She's definitely wearing the white hat; bad guys only interest me to the extent that understanding them helps the lead characters, the good guys, catch them. It is not my personal taste to enjoy shows about good bad guys or visa versa. I'm really not into the-end-justifies-the-means kind of portrayals. At the very least, I just don't choose to watch them. And I'm so happy to say that Vera spares me from that. The writers give what is, I think, an accurate glimpse of why Vera is driven. Brenda Blethyn's masterful portrayal of a driven overcomer is sheer perfection.  Many people use the term survivor to describe folks like Vera, and while I don't disagree with that; to me a survivor is one who has lived through something. This is true by the basic meaning of the word survive.  What doesn't kill you doesn't necessarily make you stronger. It can be true of course but, it isn't a given. What makes you stronger is what you do next; after you get up and dust yourself off. It is oh so easy to make your situation worse by doing the ""wrong"" thing next. An overcomer is one who is in the process of bearing up under the weight of the wounds they've sustained in the battles of life and doing the ""right"" thing next.  That's just the way I see it, and apparently so does Vera. This agreement in thinking is illustrated in episode one, Castles in the Air.  In my experience, there are skirmishes and then there is all-out war!

Over twelve episodes contained in three sets of Vera, clues are revealed to us of what has brought her to where she is in her life; as a person and DCI. She's doing what she believes is the ""right"" thing next. Her behavior is understandable to me. At times it isn't pretty nor excusable but I get her.

Vera is also a thinker. She ponders everything! I can see her brain wrapping itself around the why and the how of the crimes she solves.  Life has developed her presuppositions, and they work in the job she does. She uses her innate curiosity in tandem with her understanding of what makes most people tick. She asks the right questions at the right time.  She watches and she sees. She listens and she hears. Reading people isn't science whereby the same result can be reproduced over and over again in some laboratory. People are much too complex for that, so she works things through little by little. She sticks like chewing gum to a cat to her belief in evidence, evidence, evidence! Her thoughts nag, nag, nag.  She pursues all avenues of her thinking but doesn't jump to conclusions. (Even though Joe would like for her to get some exercise.) She isn't out to get a conviction just for conviction's sake. She doesn't want to live in a world like that. For her, a murderer is a murderer no matter what led them to it or the outright ugliness of the victim. She's damned good at her job.

Vera is not the easiest person to work for; she tends toward the sarcastic, acerbic and impatient. Her team is solid and good at what they do. They have to be because she also tends toward intolerance of anything less. She pushes her people. If you can't perform, keep up, follow orders, (it's not ours to wonder why...) or just take what she dishes out then you'd best put in for a transfer. (And we saw that in a previous episode in Set Two.) Through her relationship with her sergeant, Joe Ashworth, we can see that she isn't so intolerant or arrogant that she won't allow her people to have thoughts of their own. She's just particular.

Vera lives alone, of course, in a remote and isolated ramshackle cottage she inherited from her father. She literally had to shovel it out to live in it. Looking at it, I was surprised that she had electricity and running water! It is a boon that she has cell phone service. I'm sure there is no central heating. It is in this house that she sustained many of the wounds she carries around. This is another hint to what is going on inside her. Living in isolation isn't for wimps but it can be helpful as part of a person's self-defense mechanism. Trust isn't something that Vera does, it is much too risky. I believe that in Vera's mind, trust makes her vulnerable and that's not only unsafe and uncomfortable; she thinks it makes her weak. I must say that she keeps people away as good as I've ever seen it done. But, there are cracks in her chinking. She's let Joe in bit by bit, just as the harsh Northumberland wind whistles through the walls of her father's house. Joe is interesting to me because he doesn't let Vera's orneriness repel him. He is caring and courageous enough to keep going where everyone else fears to tread. He flows through her protestations and subject changes like water through a crack in a dam.

If Vera and Joe were mother and son I'd wonder who the parent is. Vera doesn't take care of herself at all and Joe nags her to do so. It goes without saying that Vera outwardly bristles and snaps at Joe's nagging and ""making a fuss."" I do think though that deep down she's glad that someone cares if she pops her clogs. She obviously cares about him; demonstrating it in a clever way, albeit unseen by anyone, including Joe, at the conclusion of episode one.

David Leon who plays DS Joe Ashworth is quite lovely to look at but that is unimportant in his part and portrayal. I like how his good looks are not part of the story. Joe's a happily married man, to his childhood sweetheart, (trite, I know) and they have three children. I pray to God that the writers keep it like this. I'll definitely be cranky if they deviate. Other returning cast members in Set Three are Kenny who in an episode sports a new ""do"" to help him look younger for his new and younger woman. It doesn't quite work. He's still a damned fine plodder though. We also see again Billy, the pathologist, who is weirdly much too into his job. He's definitely a bit creepy but pathology in general gives me the creeps. (I avoid those programs where half of my time is spent with my eyes closed because blood and innards make me sick.) I enjoy Billy's wit and his falsetto singing isn't too shabby either. I got a kick out of his ""singing"" scene as well as his new ring-tone for Vera's calls. New to the show is Shep, short for Shepherd. A female detective who shows some guts in taking Vera's, let's say, managing style. She holds her own and fits in nicely. I hope she makes a return in Set Four, which cannot come soon enough for me!

As this is Set Three, I am assuming that you've seen Set One & Two. My review is based on that premise, that you know the basic gist of what this series is about. If you have not,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-2/dp/B008OTTTP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 2</a>&nbsp;and enjoy!  Just in case: This is a UK format DVD.  I have a multi-regional DVD player, which are sold here on Amazon...I think I spent $50 for mine.  (I also read in a review that some, not all, but some DVD players can be altered to become multi-regional.  Google should be able to help you there.  A good option to try before investing in a new player that might not be necessary.)  I only mention this because I have noticed some confusion regarding this a time or two in reviews for other UK DVD's.  So, if you are wondering how I've seen this before it is released in the US...

Each episode has a good mystery to be solved with some sharp portrayals of revenge, atonement, abuse, betrayals, and misunderstandings. Basically, the compost of life. I also want to tip my hat to the writers, once more, for not annoying me with some supervisor hanging over Vera's shoulder haranguing, sniping, winging, blaming, and taking credit for her work. So, ta for that.

***Possible Spoiler***

Finally, I'll share that out of the plethora of fine scenes, my favorite involves Vera, a bottle of whiskey and a nun. (And no, they don't go into a bar...)

Enjoy!",1383091200,12,10424,4.580558539205156
8549521,5,B00AB22OYC,"The best mysteries transcend the genre to encompass a wide range of life-issues; ""Vera: Series 3"" explores this complexity beautifully. Filmed in clouded northern light, with nuanced shades of human emotion, ""Vera"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. Always superb, Brenda Blethyn is the driving, elemental force that is Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope: salt of the earth. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern English landscape, weathering storms of conflict within and without. This superb actor grew up in unpretentious, working-class circumstances, and she brings that wealth of experience to her role. DCI Vera Stanhope's unresolved pathos over her lonely life underlines the narrative. Slugging down whisky under sullen clouds, Vera once declared that solitude is not for the faint-hearted. Northumberland is another character, its rolling hills and rough coastline, the heavy line of the sea, castle ruins, and towns hit hard by decades of economic hardship, providing a unique canvas for these mysteries. Houses huddle under a leaden sky that slams down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. The northern dialect, strewn with a heritage of Viking remnants, is as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale. Northumberland's northern light and wave-tossed seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape.

The haunting soundtrack, by Ben Bartlett, adds an ominous depth to the series. The marvelous Brenda Blethyn is amazing as Vera, she and the rest of the talented crew authentically bring alive the mystery novels of Ann Cleves. The series is further enlivened by a great cast. David Leon is excellent as Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, coping with Vera's dark moods and worrying over her health. Jon Morrison plays long-suffering Detective Constable Kenny Lockhart, Paul Ritter is great as the creepy Pathologist Billy Cartwright, Sonya Cassidy perfectly depicts Sergeant Joe Ashworth's wife Celine, and Clare Calbraith is newcomer DC Rebecca Shpherd. In the U.K., theater, movie, and television productions value actors who are robustly, deeply human, and provide venues like this series that share this wealth of talent. All the guest stars are top-notch.

The four episodes include: ""Castles in the Air,"" ""Poster Child,"" ""Young Gods,"" and ""Prodigal Son."" Running time: approximately 352 minutes. Note: English subtitles are helpfully provided. I hope that ITV makes this more widely available soon, with a release here (this U.K. version of ""Vera: Series 3"" will only play here on region-free DVD players). Thankfully, ""Vera"" has been renewed for a 4th season. Don't miss the previous collections that are indeed available here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-1/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-2/dp/B008OTTTP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 2</a>.

Castles in the Air: Written by Paul Rutman & Gaby Chiappe, this opens with the death of physiotherapist Lizzie Faulkner (Eva Quinn), shot to death outside a vacation retreat at Meadow Pond. DCI Vera Stanhope (Brenda Blethyn) impatiently notes that ""bloody lampers"" have been about, shooting local wildlife. Robert Doran (Richard Riddell) comes under suspicion, as his cigs, DNA, and gun match elements found at the scene. It turns out, DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon) have a history together, and the situation is more complicated than it first appeared. Lizzie may not have been the intended target, and the motive could possibly hark back to previous incident, years ago. Grieving father Justin Bishop (Shaun Dingwall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B00ANDDBBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>) may be involved, whilst son Sam (Alexander Arnold) keeps an even keel. Frustrated with the investigation, Vera declares that you can't ""shave a pig and call it a ham."" In one wonderful scene, she shows a particular concern for Joe, that involves burning something...

Poster Child: Written by Paul Rutman, this story takes us to Tynside and Newcastle. After their father is brutally killed, Karen Marsden (Amy Cameron) and her adopted, diabetic sister Mira (Shifaa Aafan) are kidnapped. Their mother (Saskia Reeves) frantically calls in DCI Vera Stanhope and her team at the Northumberland & City Police. Jonah Regan (Dean Andrews,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-On-Mars-U-K/dp/B0038M2SAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life On Mars, U.K.</a>), a mysterious photographer, seems to know more than he lets on, while an illegal immigrant, Malik (Amir Boutrous), is struggling with his demons. The stark landscape, with violently blue clouds and sea, is a perfect backdrop to this stark story of loss and identity.

Young Gods: Written by Gaby Chiappe, this mystery opens in Northumberland's autumn woods. A group of students witness the awful death of Gideon Frane. Vera and DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon) give a lift to one of the young students, Ruthie Culvert (Rebecca Benson), who lives in a chaotic home with her grieving mother (Matilda Ziegler) and grandfather (Kenneth Colley), who is ex-CID. With this third mystery, we finally get something there should be more of: time with Vera in her cottage. Thirteen minutes in, she's frying sausages. Too often, Vera drinks her dinner. She and Joe interview Gideon's old girlfriend Izzy Rawlins (Jodie Comer), who he terrified. Joe accuses her best friend, spirited Kit O'Dowd (Kevin Trainor is marvelous) of murdering Gideon. Kit scoffs, ""Have you seen the bloody kit I have back at work? I've got a cutthroat razor. I've got scissors that would take your ear off. Why would I bloody burn a man to death!?"" St. Finan's school principal Dr. Ripman (Maureen Beattie), and former students Jamie Levinson (Mark Quartley) and Sister Claire (Pippa Bennett-Warner), come under Vera's radar. In a nod to the Catholic roots of Northumberland, a revealing reunion occurs between Vera and her former teacher at St. Anselem's, Sister Benedict (Ruth Davies, always a treat). Don't miss caf owner (Simon Barks) and his donuts (he will not lie and conceal their existence from Vera). Thanks to director of photography, Jean Philippe Gossart, this is a gorgeously filmed episode, from the lichen on a fencepost, to Northumberland's Vermeer-lit autumn sky.

Prodigal Son: By Marsten Bloom, a mystery unfolds on a promising night with a man and a woman meeting at Tuxedos Bar. Janna Jeffries (Emily Taaffe)  thought she was going to have fun with the bloke, but the evening goes awry when John (Alan Westaway) gets stabbed to death on a cobbled side street. Initially, no one knows the victim's last name; he had a BMW with false plates and a stash of money hidden within. Janna turns out to have a friend named Carrie Kinsdale, whose significance we glimpsed in the first mystery. Cara is Vera's half-sister. Appropriately, she lives across the street from a graveyard; will Vera garner enough courage to meet her? Newcastle forms a perfect backdrop to this story, which involves a brewery, hostile takeovers, and John's lost-love Lisa (the great Christine Bottomley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Street/dp/B005N8KP3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Street</a>). Vera tells Lisa's abusive husband Ross, ""And she has to settle for you over the cornflakes."" John's sister is engaged to a brewery owner (Liam Cunningham); was John involved with his lovely daughter (Sophie Stuckey)? This dark mystery has lighter moments, with one of the cutest art-cards ever (wait for it), and the hope for a new life. Thanks to the director of photography, Adam Suschitzky, BSC, this is another masterful visual treat, with Northumberland snow, sea, and sky, wind turbines, and an old churchyard under a mantle of clouds.

We look forward to more of the quick-tempered, cantankerous DCI Vera Stanhope; hopefully the series will continue for many more seasons. And the evocative, bleakly beautiful Northumberland landscape is a welcome, perfect stage for these mysteries. The deeply talented, always compelling Brenda Blethyn is wonderful in the sharp comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Grace/dp/B00003CXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Grace</a>, and graceful dancing with Alfred Molina in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undertaking-Betty/dp/B000CDGVPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undertaking Betty</a>, with cats Fred & Ginger.",1382400000,8,8732,5.9356120826709065
