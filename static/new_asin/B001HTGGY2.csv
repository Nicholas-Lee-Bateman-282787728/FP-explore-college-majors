8309586,5,B001HTGGY2,"CALTIKI, THE IMMORTAL MONSTER is one of the best blob-monster movies ever made. While, arguably, not as brilliant as THE BLOB, or X THE UNKNOWN, this movie is still a fantastic entry in this squishy, oozing sub-sub-genre. Found in a cave lake, a lump of CALTIKI is brought back to civilization, after the monster devours / dissolves the arm of an archaeologist. Said archaeologist was exploring the lake, deep within some Mayan ruins, when gold was discovered, along w/ CALTIKI. Disaster strikes when CAL' escapes its laboratory container, going forth to seek more tasty humans to snack on! The creature grows to immense size, causing further catastrophe! If you are a fan of such films -and who isn't?- then you owe it to yourself to add this to your gelatinous glob collection right now!...",1441065600,2,792,4.917910447761194
8309587,3,B001HTGGY2,"Be aware that there are 2 different Italian DVDs of CALTIKI.
The Noshame edition of CALTIKI get's 5 stars. This is a review of the cheaper Prime Media edition which has some flaws that may bother some people. The IMDb says the correct OAR of the film is 1.66:1 and, with the slight black bars on either side of the image, this seems to be a very slightly inaccurate presentation. The problem here is that the image is a bit stretched on the sides compared to the Noshame edition making the actors appear to be slightly chunkier than they should be. It may not be all that noticeable to most viewers.
The overall image is not as sharp as it could be in both editions, but after all the dark and cropped copies of the film that I have seen, this looks like a Criterion compared to the best of the bootlegs that have been floating around.
I found this for about 10 dollars plus postage here on Amazon so it's worth getting for those interested in this early Mario Bava involvement and not willing to pay the scalper prices for the earlier edition. It's a great film and pretty gory for 1959. The climax also very exciting. I really do love the film quite a bit even with the dopey English dub.
The earlier oop and now pricey release from Noshame (also an Italian DVD) had 2 excellent 20 minute docs:
1. 'Riccardo Freda, Maestro Dimenticato' (19 mn) with Stefano Della Casa on Freda's career.
2. 'La Genesi Di Caltiki' (22 mn) with Luigi Cozzi speaking on the genesis of Caltiki.
There was also a very good photo gallery that is not on here. The one included here is absolutely worthless. Just a bunch of still frames and no color posters or any advertising at all.
Both of the documentaries were in Italian only and had no English subs so this may not be that great of a loss for those who do not understand Italian. There was also an Italian audio commentary that is not here either.
This edition carries over the US Trailer and the opening credits for the Allied Artists USA release only.
So if you can find this for around ten to fifteen dollars and you are only interested in an English friendly and decent copy of the film, this is the way to go. Beware of dealers selling this for much higher prices. Be sure you are getting the Noshame Films version if you want all the excellent (but Italian only) extras and are paying a lot of dough for it. Please don't pay more than 15 plus postage for this edition.

Also note that this is non region 1 and you have to have a multi region player in order to watch this. These DVD players are so cheap now, its worth the 30 or 40 dollars that they go for now.",1429228800,,2601,4.319018404907975
8309588,1,B001HTGGY2,"I hate writing this.
  I hoped so much that I would after so many years attain a really watchable copy of this grand old monster flick. Not yet.
  I bought a Panasonic ""all region"" player two years back as I have a region 2 copy of ""Strange World of Planet X"". Never a problem. Now I have my replacement copy of ""Caltiki"", and it plays badly or not at all. The look is great but it won't play.",1382832000,,393,4.0
8309589,5,B001HTGGY2,Caltiki-il mostro immortale PAL Region 2 is the only way to go for this classic throwed-off 50's corny masterpiece. Scared the devil out of me as an eight yr. old. My Oppo DV-981HD DVD Player reconfigures to Region 0 to play ALL DVD Formats. No problem viewing non NTSC DVDs. Quality of film transfer is OK (could be better). Decent wide-screen version. Audio (language) sets to Ingles or italiano. No problems with this Italian import.,1228348800,5,436,4.826666666666667
