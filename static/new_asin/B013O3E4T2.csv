They were expecting the film to be with English subtitles, but sad to say its not.  They are Very Very disappointed, so am I as Its a complete waste of my money.
PLUS THIS DVD NOT COMPATIBLE WITH UK DVD PLAYER...........BEWARE!!!!!!!!",1357603200,2,360,4.625
8728242,5,B013O3E4T2,"Damn, this is one amazing film-simply one of my favorites of all time. The entire cast is simply brilliant, the film is drop dead HILARIOUS(seriously, I don't find a lot of things funny, but this gets me cracking every time), the dialogue is sharp and, again,HILARIOUS, and the story itself is funny, and poignant,simple, but at the same time, simply unforgettable.
And the characters-all so rich, and complex, just add to this spectacular marvel of a film which is so true to life, so humane, so touching,funny,smart, and full of genuine life.
I BEG YOU TO SEEK THIS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE LITTLE FILM OUT.",1087776000,9,602,4.854368932038835
