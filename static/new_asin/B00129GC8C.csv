8244832,2,B00129GC8C,"The guy is cool. The lady is awful. Her movements are clumsy and unaesthetic. I have no desire to copy or imitate them. This would only worsen my dancing. This DVD might be somewhat helpful for guys, but definitely not for girls.",1322524800,,229,4.476190476190476
8244833,2,B00129GC8C,The instructions were given in a fragmented way. It's difficulty to connect those steps together despite clear instruction on each steps. The instructor should put all the steps in one coherent sequence.,1268352000,,203,5.375
8244834,1,B00129GC8C,"Great video for interesting music and some commendable exercises.  Terrible for learning steps, patterns or an integrated routine. No slow motion shots for any steps.  Makes it difficult to pickup correct foot movement.  No integrated pattern to give you the sense you actually learned the dance.  Looking elsewhere would be advisable.",1267228800,2,335,5.509803921568627
8244835,3,B00129GC8C,This video is not as good as other instructional video where they show how to put all the steps together,1257292800,2,104,4.25
8244836,5,B00129GC8C,I recently purchased this video to enhance by basic knowledge of West Coast Swing.  The teacher goes over all the basics and breaks down the moves and timing of the man's and ladie's parts so it is very understandable!  I am looking forward to purchasing the next level and learning more moves.,1238544000,2,294,4.634615384615385
8244837,5,B00129GC8C,I bought this DVD to learn some new Salsa moves for Social Dancing.  My partner and I had a lot of Fun doing these moves and we learned them pretty fast!  The instructor makes it easy to follow along and explains the steps very well!,1238544000,,233,4.155555555555556
8244838,1,B00129GC8C,"While the ""moves"" shown were well done and demonstated in slow motion even, they would have done better to name the various moves or sequences.  That is the normal method when teaching dancing and would make remembering the seqences much easier.  For instance - Move #1 doesn't mean anything to me, while calling it a ""right side pass."" does mean something.",1237248000,2,357,4.836065573770492
8244839,1,B00129GC8C,"I have purchased numerous dance instructional videos and this is one of the worst.  It is advertised as 91 minutes, but there is only 18 minutes of instruction on jive.  The remaining time is wasted on the ""bonus materials"", which show other types of dance and the only purpose I see with it is to advertise their other videos.

The instruction on the jive is very poor.  I think the only words spoken are ""rock back, 1, 2 3, 4"".  There is virtually no verbal instruction or explanation on the moves.  The dance instructor expects you to learn simply by watching the moves.  Most of the moves demonstrated in real speed look awkward, last only 2-3 seconds, and the music does not even sound like jive.  These make the moves very hard to follow.

The only useful parts are the slow motions.  This is why I gave it a credit of 1 star.  But again, the slow motions also do not have verbal instruction or explanation.

This video is a waste of money.",1207008000,5,946,4.404624277456647
