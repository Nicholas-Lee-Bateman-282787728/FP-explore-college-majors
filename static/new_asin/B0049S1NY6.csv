4293910,4,B0049S1NY6,"There's nothing like winning the Super Bowl and being able to look back and say we we're the best team.  Equally exciting for me though is the journey... and you can't tell the story of this team without talking about the season as a whole.  This film did a pretty good job of telling the tale.  With jaw dropping highlights that we won't soon forget as well as game after game of heartbreaking defeats in the end.  If you're looking for a Hollywood style movie with ups and downs, twists and turns... watch Rudy.  If you want to be able 10 years from now to relive this unbelievable season then definitely get this DVD/Blu-ray.",1300924800,,628,4.473684210526316
4293911,5,B0049S1NY6,What can I say but a team comes out of nowhere and has to win how many games just to get to the Super Bowl.  Definately a Cinderella story.  This was the best price anywhere for this DVD and I live in PACKER YOOPER COUNTRY.  My only complaint is why was this DVD made in Mexico?  America we must get things made in AMERICA by Americans getting a fair wage.,1300579200,,356,4.042857142857143
4293912,2,B0049S1NY6,"Huge Packer fan but this dvd left me wanting.  I have an old vhs tape of the last Packers superbowl run and in my opinion it is much better.  The color was more vibrant and the replays were much better.  This whole dvd looked ""washed out"" and most of the replays were from ground level, at times even from behind players. I enjoy seeing the plays develop from up above.  Some of the antics by some of the players does provide enjoyment however.",1300320000,3,444,4.313253012048193
4293913,5,B0049S1NY6,"Anyone who actually reads the description of this item would see exactly what this Blu-ray includes.  NOWHERE does it say that this is the FULL GAME IN ITS ENTIRETY, so why would you assume that?  Anyway, just because you goofed up does NOT mean that this item ""sucks.""  This is a GREAT video.  I've been buying the highlight DVDs for years and I love 'em.  It's a great recap of a great season, with the great NFL Films' music and narration.  There are a bunch of bonus features that take you behind the scenes of the games and players.  *****If you want the full game, you can buy it on iTunes for $2.99!!*****  Get them both and you'll have the ultimate Super Bowl XLV combo.  This is a MUST HAVE for any Packers fan.",1300060800,24,720,4.313432835820896
4293914,2,B0049S1NY6,"Well, I bought, and expected some how a commercial FREE copy of the SUPERBOWL XLV game. It is not. What it is, is a great Summary of the Packer's Season which lead to the SUPERBOWL XLV  victory.  It is a wonderful look back of how an underdog team, beat the Odds and came out on top. Luckily the opponents made some costly errors, as did the Packers. But we were in the right place at the right time to capitalize on those errors and score the winning touchdowns.  So, sit back and enjoy the ride, over teams like the AWFUL CHICAGO BEARS and against the Dreaded Minnesota VIKINGS and former Packer Bret Favre. It IS AARON ROGERS season and ability all the way. With an assist by some second and third string HEROES!  A wonderful keepsake of a great season, with lots of surprises and disappointments, leading to the very top!",1299974400,4,825,4.443708609271523
4293915,1,B0049S1NY6,"I taught this was the game but all this is a bunch of highlights from the season. This is crap and I want my money back.  As a huge NFL Fan, DO NOT BUY THIS BLUERAY ! It Sucks!",1299888000,4,176,3.5128205128205128
4293916,3,B0049S1NY6,"Having been a Packer fan for a while I own the 1996 SB champs video on VHS. I think the 96' highlight film is directed much better than this one. Reason I say this is the audio. Whereas the old tape featured well-orchestrated music which helped to dramatize the action on the field the backround music on this one is dull. Still, if your a Packer fan, this DVD is great to watch due to the content.",1299628800,2,398,4.181818181818182

4293918,5,B0049S1NY6,"First of all, this is NOT THE SUPER BOWL GAME.  This is a summary video of the Packers' season (including very entertaining post-season highlights), and it is very well done.  If you are looking for the complete Super Bowl game, you'll want this set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-Green-Bay-Packers-Road-to-XLV/dp/B005X7H9Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL-Green Bay Packers-Road to XLV</a>.  That video has the complete games of the entire playoff run (but they didn't release a Blu-ray version). This video does not have complete games on it.  Again, this is a summary of the Packers' season plus some good extras that are listed in the product description.  If that's what you want, order away.

4293919,5,B0049S1NY6,"This should be great.  If you didn't watch the Packers though out the season or are not a fan, I think you can still really enjoy this(unless your a bears fan, sorry, this isn't the video for you).  If you didn't know, the 2010-2011 season for the Green Bay Packers was nothing short of amazing.  This was the team that was favored to win the super bowl pre-season.  But at the half way point the half the team was injured and they were on a losing streak.  After Aaron went down and they lost to Detroit(yeah i know, how does that happen), they went into New England to lose again with out there star QB.  Now this is where the magic started.  The team would have to win there last two at home to make it in the playoffs.  Once in the team would have to face 3 straight road games against the best the NFC had to offer to make it to Dallas.  Only one other 6th seed team had ever went on the win it all(funny that it was the team they were playing in the super bowl). Some will call it lucky, but i believe if you watch this video you will change your mind.  No one on this team ever gave up until there was nothing left to prove.  This team will take you on emotional roller coaster though out the season.  It wasn't always pretty but ended the best way possible.  Lastly this video gives you the chance to watch a great QB who is quickly proving he might be the best in the game.  P.S.  You may have figured out I'm a cheese head but i'm also a football fan and this was the best I have ever seen.",1298505600,48,1500,4.03728813559322

You are invited to enjoy in the Turkish Delites, the beauty of the world, the depth of the charecters. I am just blown how this was not awarded an Emmy, Grammy, and a Tony. So worth the money.

Remembering the ups/downs in the challenges of winning their NFC division, then the Super Bowl was a little bittersweet (injured players).  Despite challenges the Pack have faced, they have always remained confident in their ability to turn games around.  I saw that last season and the season before.  I can also describe them as a ""never say die"" team which will get them back into the playoffs...prayerfully recapturing the Championship Title.

A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

4293972,4,B0049S1NY6,"The dvd had decent highlights but doesn't capture the despair that the Packers endured throughout the season.  From the heartbreaking overtime losses, to the unimaginable injuries, and then to bounce back to become the ultimate underdog and win it all, this could have been spectacular.

The Pack had to win their final 2 regular season games to even make the playoffs.  The Pack then became the visiting team for every playoff game.  The Pack had to face a heavily favored Falcons team that they lost to earlier in the year, and then faced the Bears for the NFC Championship...... come on, this is DESTINY!!!

Never before had a 6th seeded NFC team won the Super Bowl.  Even Madden's NFL video game predicted Green Bay to lose (except for the Giants/Patriots, the game had predicted every winner in previous years).

Overcoming the loss of Donald Driver and Charles Woodson in the biggest game of their careers, again, DESTINY!!

The DVD offers highlights but didn't capture the emotional rollercoaster that every fan/player experienced.  It's a good film but missed the true story of the greatest accomplishment in football history.",1305590400,,1134,5.021390374331551

You can feel that the Packers are off-kilter from the loss of their veteran leaders, and feel the intensity of Greene, who knows he has to rally the defense NOW. And then, on the next play, Matthews causes the fumble that's recovered by Bishop....which changes the momentum of the game, for good. Wow.

Like other NFL Films productions, this one is very well put together, with lots of miked-up bits. It's a great complement to the actual game. We've watched it several times already, each time picking up a few new details.",1304208000,,664,4.627118644067797

Many years of getting to big games and having the wheels fall off at crucial momements. Well this DVD proves how wrong it was to compare that Packers team with what we (gladly) have now. Watching this DVD I was amazed at how loose these guys are. It seems like everyone contributes ideas as to how to beat Big Ben and the Steelers. When Clay Mattews headbutts B.J. Raji and says ""Be a hero"" it is one of many great moments here. I haven't even mentioned Rodgers! No ""riverboat gambler"" here just the most precise passer in the game. I was amazed at the Pack's playoff run and the Super Bowl. After watching this DVD, not amazed anymore. NO ONE could have beaten this team.",1303862400,2,827,4.273885350318471

4293981,5,B0049S1NY6,"Great DVD if you're a football fan. Incredibly cool and inspiring and emotional DVD if you're a Green Bay Packer fan. I actually got tears in my eyes when Kevin Greene is telling Clay Matthews ""IT'S TIME"" before the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl. Then he pops Mendenhall for a game changing fumble.
The whole season is here, the pre-season highs and middle of the season lows and just when most Packer fans may have given up and wrote the season off as one with just too many injuries, they come back and make the greatest playoff run in NFC history. I love the Green Bay packers. World Champions....AGAIN.",1302393600,,606,4.5181818181818185

4293986,5,B0049S1NY6,"The month of February has always been a very valuable month for me. My mother's birthday is on February 1st, Father's is February 8th, I celebrate mine on February 26th and this year me and my girlfriend Megan will be celebrating our 2  year anniversary together.  Aside from personal life, February has also been a special month as a life-long football fan. The first weekend of February consists of the one day that every NFL fan can be united regardless of what team we cheer for as we watch the biggest game of the year as well as say goodbye to the sport we are so passionate about for a long drought of 7 months (not counting the pre-season games for those of us who watch them). However, unlike years past, this year is not just another Super Bowl game for me. It is simply a childhood dream come true before my eyes and a moment I was not sure that I could have anticipated or be alive to witness.

On February 6, 2011 the Pittsburgh Steelers will meet the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV.  In what is anticipated to be one of the most watched and most exciting Super Bowls in the history of its existence, it holds ground in the sense that there is a common divider among who fans will be cheering for whoever leaves as the victor. While both Steeler and Cheesehead nation are considered to be the two largest and arguably most passionate fan-bases in the history of the NFL, so are the betting odds currently. The Green Bay Packers are a 2.5 point favorite. The most common question that I have been asked this week as many of you who know my story is ""Will, what team do you believe will win?"" My response has remained the same all week long and will currently stay that way until the start of Super Bowl and that is ""Whoever plays better will win"".

Without spilling my life story into this blog, my favorite NFL teams of all-time are indeed the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers. Many people become baffled when they hear this and are even more stunned given the circumstances. I have been asked questions like ""Whose jersey will you wear?"" ""Who will you cheer for more when they score a touchdown?"" ""What if the game is a blow-out?""  Certainly these are excellent questions and I have asked myself them several times when I look at this game and think about the emotions that I have been riding for two weeks and I am sure will be running even higher as the game moves closer.

There were many things that factored my decision into cheering on both of these teams. My heart has always sided with the Pittsburgh Steelers since I was a young boy and saw them play in Super Bowl 30. At the time, the Dallas Cowboys were dubbed America's team and essentially loved by every football fan in the nation. Emmitt Smith was breaking rushing records, Michael Irvin was being crowned as one of the greatest wide receivers of all-time, Troy Aikman and Deion Sanders won their third Super Bowl ring and Jimmy Johnson's famous quote ""How bout them Cowboys!"" rang out on every sports media outlet in the United States. Aside from not feeling obligated to root for the Dallas Cowboys, the Pittsburgh Steelers always struck me as a team that described my love for the game of football. My passion grew for them as I slowly began learning more about the history of the organization and the way that they had found success throughout the 1970s.

From the most feared defense in the history of the NFL who called themselves the Steel Curtain to Lynn Swann's incredible play-making abilities to Terry Bradshaw's ""clutch gene"" to Art Rooney's contributions to the organization as well as the city of Pittsburgh it was a situation where no matter what side I looked at it from I could not help but become more and more fascinated with the team until it finally became clear to me that the Pittsburgh Steelers represented everything that I wanted to become which was a hard working person who succeeded in life no matter whether it was expected from me or if it was something I started from the ground up.

From there, I watched every Pittsburgh Steelers game on national television from the time that I was 11 years old. Every time I watched them run on to the field and the black and gold audience was shown swinging their terrible towels I felt as if it was some sort of sign to me that I was born to love this team. On February 6, 2006 one part of my dream came true as the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowl XL. To this day, I describe that as my 2nd favorite sports moment of all-time (being a Buckeye first and foremost it will still be very hard to top the 2002 Fiesta Bowl). Also as a Buckeye, watching Santonio Holmes make the game winning Touchdown of Super Bowl XLIII where the Steelers won their sixth Super Bowl was a moment that I still replay in my head over and over again.

The Green Bay Packers always sparked my interest in various ways. When someone speaks about the history of the Super Bowl and the NFL, this is a team who cannot be removed from any conversation. The word ""win"" in its own sense cannot be mentioned to any football fan without the face of Vince Lombardi appearing in the back of one's mind. It is that same name whose legacy has been so far spread and widely respected that it received the honor of having the Super Bowl trophy named after it. My appreciation for the game of football begins with the recognition of the Packers contributions to the birth of the Super Bowl along with Bart Starr's legendary performances and Lombardi's expectations that every player under him gave a 110% effort every moment they were on the field.

If I said that Brett Favre did not spark my interest in the Green Bay Packers at some point, I would be lying through my teeth (or in this case through my keyboard). Maybe I am plagued with the same admiration that virtually every NFL analyst, reporter or commentator was at one point but when I think of some of the best moments I had watching football growing up it contained some of Brett Favre's highlighted performances. Obviously, Favre is viewed much differently in the eyes of football fans as well as Packer fans now but the moments that he created before his image took a turn for the worst were simply magical. Most recently, Aaron Rodgers has won me over as the sole successor to the Legend of Favre and in a sense watching him potentially win Super Bowl XLV would be as incredible as any other Green Bay moments that I have been captivated by over the years.

All of the above scenarios are only the beginning as to what makes me so thrilled to watch both teams every opportunity that I get. Whether it is when a Green Bay player scores a touchdown and does a ""Lambeau leap"" into the crowd of fans sitting above the end zone, the Terrible Towels swinging rapidly in the air, the chants that fill the stadiums such as ""Go Pack Go"" and ""Here we go Steelers, Here we go!"" or the banners that hang near the top decks. These are the kinds of moments when I realize how important having these moments every year in my life is and how magical it will be when I have the privilege of seeing both of these teams meet on February 6th on the biggest stage. As clich as it is to say that each of us has a destiny which is pre-determined somewhere in our lifetime, I believe that as a football fan this is mine. What this Super Bowl offers to me is far more than the biggest game of the year and a memory that I will talk about for years to come but further proof that no matter how long you have to wait or what obstacles you may face that when you have a dream and stay loyal to it anything can happen when you have faith.

In closing, I leave the famous words of Vince Lombardi.

""I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle - victorious.""

What lies ahead on February 6th is nothing short of victorious in the eyes of this football fan.",1301529600,2,7978,4.4103260869565215

4293989,2,B0049S1NY6,"Though I am a born and raised Cheesehead and am still amazed that they pulled it off with so many injuries, I am very disappointed in this season wrap up DVD/Blu-ray. You can tell that this DVD was edited and done prior to the Super Bowl, the only thing that needed to be added was the highlights of the SB and post-game celebration. There are ZERO (yes, that's right, zero) player or coach interviews on this DVD during the season highlights. You only get Greg Jennings ""mic'd up"" during the playoff run. All bonus features are prior to the SB. This is one of those things that NFL films rushed out as quickly as possible to make a buck. My guess is that there will be another DVD later that actually has player and coach interviews that talk about the season and post-SB reaction. Watched it once, and sold it on eBay. The 1996 SB video is so much better, no comparison.",1301011200,10,872,4.388888888888889
