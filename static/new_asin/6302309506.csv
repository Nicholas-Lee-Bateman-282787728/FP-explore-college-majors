452906,4,6302309506,"EDIT: PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE LATE 90'S DVD RELEASE. AMAZON.COM IN THEIR WISDOM HAS ELECTED TO PUT THIS UNDER THE ""NEW RELEASE"" DVD/BLU-RAY.

After a couple of classic fantasy films (20 Million Miles to Earth) and a couple of duds (It Came from Beneath the Sea), Harryhausen found his niche. His best films were related to mythology and fantasy adventures. Jason and the Argonauts still stands as Harryhausen's best feature but 7th Voyage has a charm all its own. What it lacks in sharp, crisp direction it more than makes up for in swashbuckling fun.

Kerwin Mathews plays Sinbad a bit stiffly but does have the atheleticism necessary for the role. While John Philip Law (who plays Sinbad in Golden Voyage) is a better actor he fails to capture the swagger of Sinbad. Matthews vividly brings Sinbad to life despite his limitations as an actor.

Torin Thatcher chews up the scenery as if to make up for the shortcomings of some of the actors. He is the perfect over the top villian for this piece.

The special effects are still powerful and the print used here is one of the best I've seen. The extras are really nice particularly the interview with Harryhausen by John Landis. The interactive menu is easy to use and the inclusion of a number of trailers reminded me how the art of creating trailers has changed over the years.

It was also nice to see Matthews interviewed about the film in the supplementary section. All in all this is a terrific fantasy film that combines great optical effects, animation and colorful performances to create a great version of the 1001 Nights fantasy tale. Highly recommended.",980640000,6,1626,4.731448763250883
452907,5,6302309506,"This film was always a favorite of mine since the first time I saw it.
Visually the print on this DVD is extraordinary. The colors are vibrant  and the images are incredibly sharp, crisp and clear.
In particular, you  can really appreciate Ray Harryhausen's Special Effects that he laboriously  produced for this film. They don't look blurred or out of focus as they  have on previous prints. They are presented here as they were intended to  be seen in their entire splendor and brilliance.  It is amazing what he did  with an eight-inch tall stop-motion model of a skeleton.
Ken Kolb's  screenplay elevates this film beyond the boundaries of what could have been  just another fantasy monster movie. He brings depth to the characters and  uses dialogue to increase the suspense of the story. Along with director  Nathan Juran and all the other filmmakers an epic fairytale unfolds and is  preserved on film.
Bernard Herrmann's score is a showstopper and as  always accentuates the images on the screen adding mood and enhancing the  overall visual effect for the viewer. Herrmann went on to score three more  Harryhausen films: ""The Three Worlds of Gulliver,"" ""Mysterious Island"" and  ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Bernard Herrmann's collaboration with Ray  Harryhausen and producer Charles Schneer equaled that of his collaboration  with Alfred Hitchcock.
Kerwin Mathews is ever so stoically heroic as  Sinbad. He is very good in this role as he brings energy and conviction to  the part. He is a man with mission and will not bend or be swayed until he  brings it to finality. It is a shame that Mathews never went on to greater  screen accomplishments.
Trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of  Dramatic Art, Shakespearean actor Torin Thatcher is the consummate evil  magician, Sokurah. He too brings conviction to his role as he is dedicated  to the forces of evil and darkness.
Visually this is far superior to the  Laser Disc version. The Laser Disc was issued in full-frame and not quite  as sharp. However, the Laser Disc version was issued with the soundtrack in  stereo. I was very disappointed that this DVD was not issued in stereo.  That would have made it completely satisfying.
However, the images are so  spectacularly presented here it is almost a minor point. Thank the gods for  Dynamation.",968716800,,2313,4.914507772020725
452908,5,6302309506,"An excellent fantasy, this motion picture is also the standard in the painstaking process of stop-animation and model-making that began with King Kong and Mighty Joe Young (the original b&w). For classic Ray  Harryhausen, the famous animator and creator of ""Claymation"",  this is the film.  No kid, big or small, can resist the adventure.",963360000,,338,5.222222222222222

452911,5,6302309506,"Matlin's summary above is quite accurate in describing this film.
I first saw this film as a child of 10 at a drive-in theater. The memory of the imagery and the music have stayed with me over the years. I've seen the  film since on tv, film festivals, and vhs. None had the clarity of image  and sound of this new DVD release.
Columbia has done Harryhausen's film  classic proud. The print quality has NEVER looked so good and is presented  here enhanced for 16x9!. The original mono sound is also quite good and  Herrmann's brilliant score moves the story right along. The extras on this  disk are quite good with the lengthy ""Ray Harryhausen Chronicles""  being the highlight. The added trailers for other Cloumbia Harryhausen  films are a treat.
Thanks to Columbia for an excellent presentation!  Their DVDs are the industry standard!",944179200,35,837,4.7972027972027975
452912,5,6302309506,"The DVD version of this classic film comes with many wonderful extras.  In addition to the usual trailers and cast biographies, it also contains THE HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES,  the excellent documentary that first appeared on  AMC. Sound and picture quality are fine, and the color never looked better.  Also having a widescreen version of the film is a joy.  This was the first  Harryhausen film I saw in a theater (during its 1975 re-release), and it is  one of the reasons why I became an English teacher as well as a lover of  fantasy and film.  It is Harryhausen's truly inspiring vision of a world of  wonders--I cannot recommend it enough.",944006400,7,643,4.763636363636364

452952,5,6302309506,"I loved this movie when it came out and have loved it ever since. Ever notice there are two cyclops, one with a single horn while the other has two horns? Harryhausen was the best stop-motion artist! How he stayed sane doing so many tedious stop-motion characters, I'll never know.

In the '70s, Kerwin Mattews moved to San Francisco where he opened an antique shop with his long-time lover. He still looked darn good. I'd had a crush on him since I first saw this film, so you can imagine my surprise when Sinbad himself walked into the ice cream store where I was working. It was the first such store to sell vanilla ice cream containing real vanilla beans, and Kerwin (he said it made him feel old when I called him ""Mr. Mathews"") wanted to check it out. We were alone in the shop as he looked around then finally said, ""You're staring, you know. ""Feeling somewhat foolish, I quoted the lines from this movie used to call the genie: ""From the land beyond beyond, from the place past hopes and fear, I bid you [Kerwin Mattews] now appear!"" He smiled as I added that I couldn't help but stare at a great movie star I'd seen in several movies and had always had a big crush on. He laughed, saying he didn't know about the handsome or big star part of what I'd said, but he enjoyed being recognized. We chatted for about 10 minutes, and I was so excited that I forgot to ask for an autograph. He was such a gentleman! He bought about $6 worth of ice cream and tipped me a $20 bill. And yes, at my request, he gave me little kiss on the cheek before he left. He passed away just a very few years later, I'm sorry to say, but I'll never forget him. And I'm so disappointed that  so few people under the age of 40 even remember this great film or any of the others Kerwin did. Well, I miss him! He was a good actor too!",1504915200,,1815,4.197707736389685
452953,5,6302309506,"This movie is very entertaining. Although the special effects might be crude by today's standards,it is still very much a fun movie. The quality of the dvd was very good.",1503792000,,170,4.7
452954,2,6302309506,"Sinbad is the captain of a ship sailing to the city of Bagdad to marry his princess as part of a political treaty between that city and Chandra...but they run out of food and water and make an emergency stop for supplies at an island where they end up fighting off a cyclops and rescuing a magician who has a magic lamp complete with genie. The magician is saved, but his lamp is lost on the island...and the magician is determined more than anything to get the lamp back, even if it means shrinking the princess to doll-size and forcing Sinbad to sail back to the island to retrieve it. But the hazards there include more monsters than just the cyclops.

Average B-movie adventure, not well-written or well-performed, with the stop-motion monsters being the film's real attraction. Okay to entertain the kids, but not really worth viewing otherwise.",1503705600,,850,4.743243243243243
452955,5,6302309506,"In a world where immitation is no longer the greatest form of flattery, but rather an attempt to squeeze the last drop of blood from a tired super hero/alien/live action animated classic driven film industry, this original gem shines like a brilliant star!
  What really needs to be said? The mythology, classic good against evil-clean family appeal, fantasy, and oh those Ray Harryhausen creations of this film make it an honest treasure.
  To let this adventure escape your grasp would be a crime.",1502409600,,499,4.975903614457831

452962,5,6302309506,"Well, I'm being a bit biased as I haven't seen all movies made with Harryhausen's effects. Still, it's the best of the Sinbad movies I've seen and I think this even tops Jason and the Argonauts. This is one of those movies I saw as a kid - both on the big screen and Sunday afternoon movies on local TV. It entranced me then and I still heartily enjoy it now. Oh, and my teenage daughter loved it too. The writing, acting, musical score, and story are all well done and this films lacks the slow spots and awkward moments in many other films of the time. The plot moves with a purpose and the heroes and villains don't disappoint. For the time, the effects are top notch and still hold up well and the blu ray transfer is solid.

We just love his claymation effects. But like I said we rented this movie to watch it, and my kids even loved the cyclops and the green snake woman in it. It is a great movie to watch and is such a classic movie and a family movie. You don't have to worry about nudity or cussing in it like you do now a days trying to watch a movie with your kids.

453056,5,6302309506,"Simply a marvelous fantasy film - extremely family friendly. It's got the standard monsters and royalty; the colors; the exciting musical score - all of which (in my opinion) would seem to entrance children. My love for the film goes a little deeper, though, since I'm quite a fan of Ray Harryhausen's animation work. And even in today's computer graphic oriented world, the assorted creatures used in this film are outstanding in both the way they move, and how they interact with the live actors. The definite highlight is a sword-fight between Sinbad and an armored skeleton - and it's absolutely incredible. I've stopped the film during this sequence many times - and though slight artifacts remain of the process, those are more than offset by the amazing presentation. When you can easily see the background through the skeleton's bones...when you 'see' the skeleton actually breaking (well, seemingly) a vase during the battle sequence - it creates wonder on a whole new level.

The film has decent enough English subtitles, as well as a commentary track. The assorted extras included definitely help one to appreciate both the film, and the world of Mr. Harryhausen.

I know there are many people who would not normally give this film a viewing - thinking it's too old, or the effects are old-fashioned, etc. Many excuses will be made, but if one is at all interested in how films and special effects are made, this is a great addition to your library.",1455840000,8,1460,4.883064516129032

453082,3,6302309506,"Released in 1958, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad was the first of three Harryhausen Sinbad flicks; the other two being 1973s The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and 1977s Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. In this first film Sinbads love interest, Princess Parisa (Kathryn Grant), is shrunk by the magician Sokurah (Torin Thatcher) and Sinbad has to hurriedly muster up a motley crew to voyage to the monster-infested island of Colossa to apprehend an ingredient to restore her. Meanwhile Sokurah is obsessed with a magic lamp and the powers of the boy genie inside.

Sinbad adventures play like a Middle Eastern version of Conan the Barbarian, albeit with a slightly funner edge and a less dour protagonist. So, if you love Conan you'll likely appreciate all three of these Sinbad films. And even though I describe these movies as having a fun edge, they're not goofy. Theyre serious sword & sorcery movies; the protagonists just exude the joy and vitality of living.

The items I demand in a Sinbad adventure are obvious: A good casting choice for Sinbad, a great adventure story & locations, a colorful assortment of likable characters & love-to-hate villains, beautiful women, and quality F/X work (for the era). ""The 7th Voyage"" delivers in most of these areas with the exception that Kerwin Mathews, while certainly a heroic protagonist, is simply too whitebread to pull off the Arabic role.  Both John Phillip Law and, especially, Patrick Wayne fit the role better in the sequels. Kathryn Grant is winsome and lovely, but she too is way too European for the role.

The Spanish locations are excellent, the score is great and the F/X work is entertaining in a nostalgic way, but there are some blatant plot holes if you think too deeply. For instance, how could miniature Parisa possibly move that piece of wood that would be the size of a huge tree trunk to you or me? Since the chained dragon breathes fire why doesnt it just scorch the protagonists as they carefully walk past? Etc.

Still, this is a worthwhile blast from the past. All three Sinbad movies are very different since each has a different person in the title role, not to mention the rest of the characters. I marginally prefer The Golden Voyage to this one, but Eye of the Tiger is my favorite because it has the best cast, story and sense of a long voyage/quest. But each has their strengths and weaknesses. For instance, the production values of Golden Voyage seem cheap at times while the runtime of Eye of the Tiger seems a bit padded.

The movie runs 88 minutes and was shot in Spain.

453111,4,6302309506,"Ray Harryhausen is a legend in the special effects field, and the 7th Voyage of Sinbad is often considered his greatest work. Personally I prefer Harryhausen's other movies compared to this one, however it not deniable how much of an impact this film made; not only in 1958 but in the annals of recent special effects. The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is pure escapism and adventure.  An uncomplicated story filled with exotic locations, fantastic creatures and action. The movie may not hold well with its age, but if you want to see the movie that inspired an almost endless list of special effects artists this is where you start.

The story kind of throws you in the middle of things. Two kingdoms on the verge of war have a truce due to Prince Sinbad being engaged to Princess Parisa, daughter and heir to the rival kingdom. On their travel home they run into a wizard seeking a genie in a lamp that's protected by a group of cyclops. The wizard tricks Sinbad into helping him, and thus the adventure begins. The storyline hits all the elements of an Arabian fairy tale, but to be perfectly honest when you look at the script and how the plot moves forward it's a rather hoaky movie that feels like a group of 10 year-old kids are making it up as they go. However I think that's part of the charm. This actually is the stuff of childhood imaginations, and to a young kid seeing this for the first time it all makes sense.

With the simplistic plot also comes some really bad decisions from the characters in the film. ""Sinbad. We don't have enough crew members for the voyage!"" ""I got it! We'll get hardened criminals from prison to be our crew. No way they are going to mutiny!"" is definitely up there in the bad idea category. Or how about this gem? ""Don't drink the water. It's poison!"" ""Hey! Are you going to let that guy boss you around? Drink it!"". This sort of writing is embarrassing by today's standards. I think it also goes hand in hand with heavy handed melodrama from many of the actors. Then again this film was never meant to be an Oscar contender, and looking at it now only shows these limitations in a harsher light.

Still this movie isn't about the acting or the plot and the bad decisions that move it forward. It's about high adventure, and more importantly Harryhausen's monsters. This is Ray's first foray into a color film, and it was not without some difficulty for Harryhausen to transfer his stop motion magic from black and white to a color presentation. Still the results speak for themselves. Not since The Animal World has Ray put so many creatures to life in one film... and in full color too. The famous cyclops, the serpent woman, the Roc and Roc hatchling, the dragon and of course the famous skeleton. You get such a wide variety of stop motion miniatures that it's hard not to see why this film is a favorite among many Harryhausen fans. It's always fascinating to see these stop motion monsters in action. All the subtle details Harryhausen put into each monster to give it character and life. This is why we loves these films.

This is the debut release of the classic film, and was released to coincide with the film's 50th Anniversary. It is on a dual layered BD and presented at a full 1090p in it's original 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The BD transfer is definitely a step up with bright colors and sharp contrasts. There is still a fair amount of grain, but that is to be expected from a film this age, and too much digital cleanup would actually hurt the overall experience. Audio is both in the original mono and English 5.1 TrueHD (also in French and Dolby 5.1 in Thai). I am always leery when surround sound is added after the fact, but I have to admit this one isn't too distracting. The film score gets the best enhancement as you can hear the orchestra vibrantly. You got a score of extras, although it seems like you are missing the outtakes from the 50th Anniversary DVD while they added the John Landis Interview. Here is the breakdown:

Commentary - The commentary to end all commentaries. Ray Harryhausen, visual effects experts Phil Tippet and Randall William Cook, author Steven Smith, and Arnold Kunert all together going through a lot of detail on how the film was made, the history of it all, and some interesting technical and behind the scenes tidbits. This is the one commentary you don't want to pass up.

Remembering the 7th Voyage of Sinbad - Extensive interview with Ray Harryhausen on the production of the movie. Another gem with great anecdotes from the master himself.

 The Harryhausen Legacy  - This one is about Harryhausen, and has an exhaustive list of directors, designers and special effects masters all paying tribute to Ray being a major influence in their own works.

The Music of Bernard Herrmann - Covers the career of Herrmann that goes well beyond Sinbad. This featurette is narrated by biographer Steve Smith.

This is Dynamation - A vintage featurette made back in the day to introduce the public to Harryhausen's innovative stop motion special effects.

 A Look Behind the Voyage - Another vintage featurette on Harryhausen's career.

Music Video - The song Sinbad May Have Been Bad, But He's Been Good To Me set to vintage promotional footage.

Ray Harryhausen - Interviewed by John Landis - Two geeks talking shop essentially. It's great for fans of filmmaking or Harryhausen who want to see more of those little details about his work.

Photo Gallery - It's a slideshow set to music that you cannot control. It runs almost ten minutes with each photo getting a few seconds of screen time.

The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is a fanciful film that the child in anybody would enjoy. It may not be the smartest film written by a long shot, but the creatures alone are enough to get your imaginations fired up.",1428278400,,5781,4.607003891050583

Nobody ever thought the monsters and effects looked real, just really cool...no CGI. Remember also that when these old movies came out, nobody ever thought the audience would be able to scrutinize every detail as they can with modern high definition.

453268,5,6302309506,"The adventures of Captain Sinbad are some of the most well known stories from One Thousand One Nights a.k.a. Arabian Nights, one of the most popular classic Arabian Literature works. This movie is loosely based on the second voyage seeking the eggs of legendary imaginary bird ""Roc"". It also takes in some of the elements from Arabian night stories such as Aladdin for evil sorcerer and the genie lamp. Other than that the movie has its original plot showcasing expertise of special effects called Dynarama. Some of the scenes might have been inspired from classic monster films such as King Kong and Toho's Godzilla series. Particularly the fighting scenes with One-Eyed Monster and the Dragon is outstanding. The film's another climax can be the duel scene between skeleton fighter and Sinbad. I could hardly contain my chuckles.

The Flying Saucers"" (1956).  Not relying only on monsters solely, it contains swashbuckling action as well.

When the cyclops made his first entrance, jeez that towering close up of that howling creature on the big screen above my seat scared the crap outta me and I ran to the lobby. My older brother teased me about it for many years. Talk about a childhood trauma! lol  Anyway It's still a favorite fantasy film I've watched repeatedly over the years. Kerwin Mathews makes a handsome but stolid action hero needed for this role and Kathryn Crosby is cute and plucky as the princess in distress for this kind of fairy tale. Torin Thatcher provides the right amount of menace as the evil magician without chewing up the scenery too much, but that's understandable since villains usually have the showier parts. But we all know the real stars are Ray Harryhausen's marvelous creatures that still look convincing in this age of CGI trickery. And that grand score by Bernard Herrmann.... how it fits like a glove to the visuals.

Last night I watched this Blu-Ray and enjoyed it again. Details on the creatures stand out better than I can remember. Some viewers have complained about too much grain in the transfer. Others here have explained the reason for the grain. I will say that grain is more noticeable in some scenes in the beginning, but once you get hooked by the story and special effects, you won't care.  Some people think that all Blu-Rays will look and sound spectacular. That's not true because it depends on what kind of restoration or remastering and transfer took place. In this case the grain was in the original film stock and the HD transfer to the Blu-Ray format might have amplified it as it happens in some cases. However If this grain was that bad I would say so as you can see from my other reviews I an concerned about video quality. Actually I noticed there was hardly any grain in about the second half starting with the crew taking over the ship. Can anyone explain why the second half of the film looks better than the first part or is it just my imagination? Overall the visual quality is reasonably good but not great.

As for the audio the DolbyTrueHD 5.1 is crisp & clean but you won't hear any separation in the front speakers or activity in the surround ones since the original soundtrack was recorded in mono. The music track is spread across all channels but not remixed for stereo.

The extras are very informative. The commentary with Harryhausen, two special effects masters, and Herrmann's biographer is outstanding and not included on the DVD version I own as well as the featurette on Herrmann's career, a must for his fans. It's narrated by the same biographer whose thorough book on him I own. For these new extras alone, this disc is worth owning if you you're a huge fan of the movie and want to upgrade from the DVD. Besides that, the Blu-Ray's video & audio quality is a noticeably good but not a great improvement from the DVD. Five stars for the film and extras; three for video & audio quality.",1371340800,6,2992,4.564245810055866

453306,5,6302309506,"Ray Harryhausen has left us, and countless movie fans mourn his passing.  He lived a fine long life, however, and leaves a treasure trove of great fantasy films behind.  Here is one of the best fantasy adventures ever put on film!  Here is a great assortment of monster scenes featuring a variety of creatures--including that famous, iconic fighting skeleton; a fire-breathing dragon; and some rather intimidating cyclopean giants.  And more, of course, much more.  I like all of Harryhausen's films, each is a wonder to behold.  But this one is the film I can watch and re-watch many times over.  It has great momentum propelling its tour through a fantasy realm of visual splendor.

In the days before home video, before I ever saw the film with sound (it didn't play often on TV in my area), I used to rent 200-foot, black and white silent 8mm reels of this from the library for 25 cents a day.  Even as a black and white silent film on a small format like 8 millimeter--stripped of its musical score and all that blazing color--this was still a stunning effects film.

And now, for the first time on DVD and Blu-Ray, we have the stereo remixed audio track that was originally available on laserdisc and VHS back in the mid-90's.  And actually I do not know how this stereo remix was created--whether from original elements, or using clever digital filtration to separate aspects of the audio.  But it sounds great, and gives Bernard Hermann's classic score even more booming dynamic punch.

Because there are different DVDs of this available, with different cover art, I should mention that this review is for the 2008 release featuring the cyclops monster front and center on the cover.

Harryhausen and Charles Schneer collaborated on a number of wonderful films, but this one, their first in color, is a real standout and a genuine classic.",1368748800,,1847,4.785488958990536

As far as the cast goes, my favorite character/actor is Torin Thatcher as Sokurah the magician.  From his first appearance, he's a man who begs not to be trusted, and yet they keep putting themselves into his hands.  The man gave a whole new meaning to sinister and yet still remained jovial at the same time; that's art.  Of course, Kerwin Mathews was near perfect as Sinbad.  The only sour notes in this production were Richard Eyer as Barani the genie and Kathryn Grant as Princess Parisa.  I don't feel that either one ever got into the spirit of the movie, both felt like they were doing something else apart from the rest.  Fortunately, neither were in the film long enough to ruin it.  As far as the story goes, it was far denser with complications than most of its ilk.  Writer Kenneth Kolb had a way of moving things along in a logical progression instead of just stringing together a set of unrelated mini-adventures.

To their benefit, the films of Sinbad feature some ground-breaking special effects provided by the grandmaster of Dynamation himself, Ray Harryhausen.  Granted, contemporary audiences may find all of the story and the look more than a bit dated (what with the prevalence of CGI today even in television commercials), but THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD remains a masterpiece in storytelling, the original experience a long time ago in a land far, far away ...

(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)

With the promise of bringing peace to their two peoples, Sinbad the sailor (played by Kerwin Mathews) heads toward Baghdad with his bride-to-be, Princess Parisa (Kathryn Grant).  Our hero and his men brave a stop on the dangerous island of Colossa, where they rescue the magician Sokurah from the jaws of an angry Cyclops.  Despite refusals by Sinbad to return to Colossa so that he may recover his magic lamp, Sokurah will stop at nothing to obtain a ship and its crew, even if it means disrupting the sailor's wedding by shrinking Parisa to the size of a doll!  Then, he tricks Sinbad into agreeing to take him back to the island where the potion to restore the princess awaits ... along with dangers aplenty!

The single greatest reason to toss in any DVD release of SINBAD is that you can enjoy a much simpler tale for a much simpler time when there wasn't as great a reliance on special effects in storytelling; but, when they were needed, they were nothing short of movie magic for their time.  The Cyclops remains as impressive today as it was when it first appeared on silver screens - a terrifying creature hungering for a taste of meat - thundering across the shoreline in pursuit of Sinbad's crew in retreat.  Of course, nothing beats the snake-woman - a visual charm that found modest re-design and reincarnation as Medusa in 1981's CLASH OF THE TITANS - and it probably sparked fear in the hearts of children for years to come.  To my delight, nothing is greater and grander than Sinbad's final sword fight with the armed skeleton; it remains one of the most inspired passages in all of filmdom, and I can't begin to imagine the difficulties it took to render a sequence that would be vastly easier with today's technology however they accomplished it in the late 1950's.  I watch it today, and I'm still awed.

Plenty has been written about the greatness of the film - and written by significantly greater scribes than I'll ever be - so let me leave it at this: see it.  Any DVD release is fine.  Yes, you can probably find a greater appreciation of it by watching some of the special features (they vary from standard DVD release to the latest Blu-ray issue), but, if you're a kid at heart like I am, you don't need any of them.  Enjoy the film as is, and remember what it's like to partake in an awe-inspiring cinematic breakthrough not unlike the first STAR WARS, THE MATRIX, or THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Filmmaking doesn't get any better than this.

THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is produced by Columbia Pictures Corporation and Morningside Productions.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds remarkable, especially given its age.  As I stated above, there are a variety of special features available to commemorate the picture, and any of them are worth their modest investment of your time.  Rated G.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Forgive me if my age is showing, but THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is classic movie magic.  In my youth, I had the chance to see it theatrically at a special matinee (in the very early 70's), and I've been in love with it ever since.  It has a swashbuckling hero; it has a princess; it has a wicked magician; and it's all set in magical locations against the backdrop of adventure, dark sorcery, and man-eating monsters.  How could it not be?  As a matter of fact, in 2008 it was added to the U.S. Film Registry where it would be preserved for all time because of its ""aesthetic significance.""  That's no small honor for the legendary hero and his brave crew.",1358726400,4,4569,4.732323232323233

453354,3,6302309506,"Now remember, you younguns, that this was honestly the best special effects available at the time. Ray Harryhausen essentially set the industry standard until computer graphics were sufficiently developed to replace his Dynavision technique. This may well be his best, although that one's a tough call. I say see as many of them as you can, and choose your favorite.

Sinbad (Kerwin Mathews) is a completely fearless sea captain, and Kathryn Grant is the much beleaguered princess he plans to marry. Torin Thatcher is the evil wizard, and cute little Richard Eyer is the genie of the lamp. Oh yes, Aladdin's not the only one to have a genie in a lamp.

Sinbad is returning to his home (Baghdad, I think) with the princess when they stop at an island to take on food and water. Problem is, this is the Island of the giant Cyclops. There's also an evil wizard who has a castle in a cave there, guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. The wizard uses his magic lamp to summon the genie to put a shield between the Cyclops and the fleeing sailors and the magician, and in doing so, reveals that the genie can only do protective magic, not destructive.

But the lamp is captured by the Cyclops, and so from the moment they land in Baghdad, the wizard is scheming to get a ship and crew to return to the island to recover the lamp. At a celebration of the upcoming marriage, with two sultans who had been enemies making friends over their offspring's impending nuptials, the wizard turns the Princess' serving woman into a four armed snake goddess. The sultans are impressed, but do not agree to give him a ship and crew.

But the wizard shrinks the Princess down to about two inches high (although with Harryhausen, the size change props are not always completely consistent as to size). Sinbad does not know it was the wizard who did it to her, though, so he agrees to take the wizard back to the Cyclops island to get the missing ingredient for his potion to restore the princess: a piece of shell from a Roc's egg.

There are many perils and monsters and special tricks, and there is that tiny princess who eventually climbs down into the lamp to talk things over with the genie. She gains his cooperation, and in exchange agrees to help free him from the lamp.

No more details: I suppose you can guess that Sinbad triumphs, the genie is freed, and they all live happily ever after. Except the magician, of course, who was crushed by one of his own monsters.

Great fun, really well done (for its day), and a very pretty picture, with gorgeous costumes and sets, a handsome hero who is rewarded with a beautiful princess. Isn't that what fantasy is all about?",1337126400,,2654,4.563025210084033

It's a great family film filled with fantasy and adventure, and the good guys always win in the end (and get their girl as well). But I have to agree with all the other one star raters. It looks like they took it from a very well used VHS tape. I thought my TV was at fault, for the graininess of the picture is downright disturbing. You try to focus on the Cyclops chasing the guys, but are forever distracted by the flashing and changing colors of the sky behind them as light and dark dots keep flashing in the background. It looks like there's a sandstorm happening behind them. Someone really needs to save this classic and give it a proper restoration. It is a total waste of money to purchase it in Blu-Ray. Get the DVD for a fraction of the cost. I'm sure all those rating it 4-5 are rating the story, not the quality of the print. It reminds me of the old TV days when you had an aerial and were trying to pick up a distant station. It would get snowy at times and then clear a bit and then snowy again. That best describes this movie on Blu-Ray. Some spots are a bit better than others, but the vast majority of the movie is very grainy. Don't waste your money.

Blu-rays, if made properly, can reproduce exactly the look of the original elements. This was a B movie, and certainly it shows up in the original elements. That's why the Blu-ray looks this way. BD can be as good as the source element. If the source element was, say, a super8 print, then we couldn't expect the blu-ray to look like Avatar, but it would look exactly as a super8 print.

The films transfer with more clarity actually exposes much of the movie magic the great Ray Harryhausen worked so hard to create. In some of the monster vs. Sinbad scenes there's an exaggerated seam and difference between the actors and the stop action animation. some of the shots are clearly out of focus as well.. i would have preferred to see this one on my old sony 4:3 TV in my bonus room.

- First off the transfer is full screen and not wide screen.  I cannot fathom why this was done as the regular DVD was in wide screen.
- Overall the resolution is only slightly better than the original but only in some places.  In others it's very grainy.
- The colors... pumping up the colors to day-glo levels just doesn't work for me.  Yes the colors were a bit muted in the original but what they've done is just silly.
- There are no extras to speak of (and the extras mentioned in other reviews are in the regular DVD release ONLY).

There's no discern-able difference between the blu-ray and the regular DVD. The crisp, clean picture of a remastered film isn't there, with a few exceptions and those are a bit strange. Example, there's a scene where Sinbad is going up stairs in the Magician's castle with Sinbad in the background and a small section of chain in the foreground. Sinbad, the stairs and the castle wall are somewhat fuzzy while the section of chain is sharp and clear. Another example of this is when Sinbad fights the Skeleton. Sinbad, again in the background, is fuzzy and the Skeleton in the foreground is sharp.

Some of the best stop-motion creatures ever made are in this movie:
CYCLOPS:  He keeps an eye out for tasty humans to barbecue on a pleasant afternoon.  He's no dummy; he'll lure you into his den with treasure, where he can easily snatch you from above, toss you into a wooden cage until it is time to eat.
DRAGON:  When really irritated, it can tele-roast you in a flash.
ROK:  A giant, two-headed mother bird; whatever you do, don't mess with her hatchling.

453392,4,6302309506,"The winning combo of Charles Schneer and Ray Harryhausen produced this fantastical version(and most satisfying of them all)starring the Persian mythic hero Sinbad.
Kerwin Matthews stars in the lead,who,as the film opens,is carrying home on his ship the princess of Chandra,Parisa(Kathyrn Grant);to which he is pledged in matrimony. While they make a brief stop on the island of Collosa for provisions,they come to the aid of an evil magician Sokourah(Torin Thatcher),who is being chased by a Cyclops. In the process of fleeing the magician looses his magic lamp to it.
His wishes foiled to return to the island, Sinbad sails home to Baghdad with the disgruntled magaician. The night before the wedding of Sinbad and the princess,the magician deliberately shrinks the princess down to a tiny size in order to force them to take him back to Collosa for the remedy to her condition.
With no choice Sinbad is forced to return to Collosa. Along the way Sinbad and the few loyal to him squelch a mutiny,thanks in big part to wailing demons on an island they pass south of Collosus. Once they reach the island,Sokourah deliberately splits them into two parties. Sinbad's group get's caught and caged by the Cyclops and Sokourah does nothing to help. With the princess's help they get free and lure the Cyclops to its' death. When they get back on track(now together and with Sinbad holding the newly re-acquired lamp)they find an egg and kill its'occupant,a baby Roc-a big two headed bird. The shell is a key ingredient needed to transform the princess back but Sakourah insists on getting to his castle to successfully complete the spell. The group is then confronted by the mother Roc who is none too pleased about her offspring,and she manages to even the score with them.
Arriving at the entrance to the castle,Sinbad and what is left of his crew see its' guardian;a giant,fire breathing manacled dragon. Once inside Sakourah is forced to undo what he has done and the princess finally gets turned back to normal size. The magician is rebuffed by Sinbad when he asks for the lamp back,as Sinbad tells him it is his only when they reach the ship. Angered Sakourah brings a Skeleton to life which Sinbad defeats. They flee through the caves and along the way throw the lamp into the fiery lava which releases the genie(Richard Eyer)from his bondage.
The dragon is now released also and just as Sinbad and the princess become its' lunch,another Cyclops enters the cave and dukes it out Mr.green scales. It is dragon one-Cyclops zero as the dragon with Sakourah in pursuit,follow the fleeing pair to the outside of the cave. The crew outside fire a giant arrow into the dragon killing it,which lands on top of the magician. Sinbad,Parisa and the genie live happily ever after.
Shot largely in Spain this well done fantasy film has many elements of suspense and action that keep you interested all the way through. Most of the Schneer/Harryhausen films were deliberatly shot outside the U.S. to save money and it does show,especially in the acting and overdubbing. But it is Harryhausen's superb special effects in stop motion animation combined with the live action sequences that make this and all their collaborative works work as well as they do. The brief fight scene with the skeleton in this film would be reprised ten times over with the horde of skeletons in ""Jason and the Argonauts"".
The print used here is a newly remastered Hi-def print and it looks great,along with the improved sound. The contrast is right on and the colours are crisp,clear and vibrant.
Special features include audio comments with Harryhausen and others,several featurettes about the movie,Dynamation and Harryhausen himself,an interview with Harryhausen by John Landis,a photo gallery and a rare release of the promo record for this film called""Sinbad may have been bad,but he's been good to me""(it's better than it sounds!).

One could say that this is the film that made Sinbad as a story just as popular as the stop-motion animation but that the other Sinbad films where carried along by the stop-motion animation.

The story launches into action from get go. Sinbad encounters a Cyclops, a genie in a lamp and a magician.  A princess is shrunk to fit in a palm and Sinbad must restore her by finding the ingredients for a special potion. While constantly dodging mutiny, Sinbad comes across a two-headed roc, giant hatchlings, a dragon and a warrior skeleton.

All in all the story moves along at a fairly entertaining rapid pace and the Harryhausen effects are still some of the best of any that he did. The acting is above par and it has more of a Hollywood feel than its sequels. Like Jason of the Argonauts this has strong repeat viewing values.",1235260800,2,945,4.547058823529412

Finally a transfer to Blu-ray. Unfortunately, it is not really enhanced so you can see the grayness of the original film that looks like it is blown up for the big screen. Fortunately once you are watching the movie ""who cares?""

The most obvious actors are the creations of Ray Harryhausen. However, what brings this film to life is the music of Composer Bernard Herrmann.

So for those of you that have never seen this film you are in for an unforgettable adventure. For those that saw it on the big screen you are in for a treat.

Be sure to go back and listen to the voice-over commentaries.

453418,5,6302309506,"Ray Harryhausen was a genius. Perhaps that's not quite the word one should use. He was a cinematic genius. He had the ability to take the unimaginable and bring it to life on the screen far before any computer generated graphics were even considered. His use of stop motion animation was second to none and filled the minds and youngsters and adults for years. And now one of his prizes makes its way to DVD.

THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is Harryhausen's first Sinbad movie followed years later by THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD and SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER. But it was this first film in 1958 that captured the imaginations of millions.

The story is basic enough with Sinbad (Kerwin Matthews) escorting a Princess Parisa (Kathryn Grant) to his homeland. There, the two are to wed finally ending the battle between their two respective countries, bringing them together in peace.

On their voyage home, they stop at a mysterious island to replenish their supplies and water. What they find instead is a giant Cyclops chasing a seemingly harmless man, Sokurah the Magician (Torin Thatcher). With the help of the genie in the lamp he carries, they are able to escape but lose the lamp in the process.

Arriving in Sinbad's country, they are greeted and wedding preparations begin. At the same time Sokurah asks for assistance in returning to the island to recapture the lamp. Denied this request, he plots to shrink down the Princess and offers his aid to help her. The only problem is that anything he has that will remedy the situation is located on the island.

Sinbad and a crew of motley malcontents head out for the island. A mutiny leaves them with little to go on but the make it anyway. So what do they encounter this time around? The Cyclops returns. So does a dragon which eventually battles the Cyclops. And Sinbad faces off against a sword wielding skeleton in Sokurah's lair. Yes, believe it or not, Sokurah is the bad guy.

Does Sinbad rescue the Princess? Do the countries unite as one? Is Sokurah defeated? Do you really expect me to answer these questions and deny you the chance to see this superb fantasy tale and discover the answers for yourself?

The movie proceeds at a quick pace and the story never gets in the way of the effects. Face it, with a Harryhausen film that is what you go looking for. And here they are outstanding. The image of the Cyclops is one that I've carried with me for years since first seeing this.

The acting is not Olivier style but done well enough to carry the storyline. Matthews and Thatcher later seemed to reprise these roles of a sort in the film JACK THE GIANT KILLER, another stop motion film though not made by Harryhausen. Kerwin's career got lost along the way and ended with his appearance THE BOY WHO CRIED WEREWOLF in 1973 and NIGHTMARE IN BLOOD in 1978 before passing away in 2007. Thatcher played a series of bad guys, mostly on television shows like DANIEL BOONE, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and more before passing away in 1961.

Made over 50 years ago this movie still holds up after all that time. For adults who get to watch it, you'll remember how incredible it all seemed to watch a man swordfight with a skeleton. For children there will be a sense of wonder at the images on the screen. Best of all this is a film that the entire family can enjoy together, something rare to find these days. And who knows, maybe the kids will become such big fans that a new generation of Harryhausen fanatics can spring up once more.",1225152000,,3490,4.5712
453419,5,6302309506,"I love this movie Ifinity! Every time I watch it, I can't get enough of it! It cheers me up in ways anybody can grab. It makes me laugh, be astounded by the Stop-motion effects by Ray Harryhausen, to make fun of it because I can't help myself, and to see an Actress play a character I can relate to. My mom (rest in peace)bought the VHS when I was 7 years old. And when she played it for me and my sisters, I was immediatly hooked! The cast was very easy for me to remember. Kerwin Matthews as the one and only handsome Sinbad, The lovely Katherine Grant-Crosby as the midget-sized princess Perissa, and let's not forget about Thorin Thatcher as the twisted evil magician, Sokurah. I forgot the boy's real name who played the adorable genie. Anyway, I like the way Kerwin's Sinbad character gets playfully strict while handling his business. Then he always find time to rescue his sweetheart, Perissa. He makes the fighting scenes fun to watch and doesn't shy away from the camera either. And as for the lovely Katherine, she did me some justice by taking the Perissa role by storm. Just like me she's a shorty, the main reason I got attached to her, her stunning and elegant costumes, her hairstyles and her wonderful smile. She's one of my favorite B-movie actresses. My boyfriend likes her too. She depends on Sinbad a great deal. She loves him more each time they see one another and always expects that Sinbad would do the right thing. Of course, she has been in danger's way, but that's only to be with her man. Who wouldn't? And as for Torin Thatcher's character Sokurah, I thought I wouldn't understand him, but I do. He was very twisted, evil, and not bright. He wanted things his way, he gave Sinbad a difficult time and he always scared Perissa without knowing it. I laughed at his acting, I called him an EGG-HEAD once and he's the kind of actor you can make fun of. You can never go wrong with Mr. Thatcher. Well, to close this review, I would like to say that I'm happy that Ray Harryhausen recieved his walk of fame. I don't know him that well,but he is one of the best Stop-Motion picture makers I like, and that's the truth. So,I recommend this movie to anybody who likes or loves B-movies!",1224288000,2,2207,4.451851851851852
453431,1,6302309506,"Fans of this film, be warned. This is the absolute WORST Blu-Ray transfer I've ever seen. It even rates poorly for a standard def release. Half of the frames were out of focus, and the in-focus shots were way overly grainy. The colors were nice, yes, but that's the only positive thing to say about this one. If you don't believe me, simply wait a couple of weeks until Hi-Def digest reviews the release, which I guarantee will confirm my conclusions.

For the record, my Blu-Ray library is over 50 titles, and I use a Panasonic BD 300 player and a 50"" Panasonic plasma.

453432,5,6302309506,"Just wanted to state this is loaded with extras.. here is a review below of the blu ray version:

The Picture

Filmed in Technicolor and framed at 1.66:1, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad arrives on Blu-ray disc in a transfer that not only shows the effects of its 50-year-old age, but also exposes some of the inherent limitations of the Technicolor format. Let me first start by saying that Sony's AVC/MPEG-4 transfer does well at capturing the source without any visible compression artifacts or processing effects such as edge enhancement and it is as sharp as it can be given the source material. There are also good shadow details, even if the blacks aren't the deepest I have seen. The Technicolor process, however, particularly in 1958, was inherently grainy and often prone to some visible variations in color contrast and density. As such, this transfer is very grainy and does display some of those variations as well as some flickering throughout. One also has to remember that the Technicolor process was known for its hyper-realistic, saturated palette that often yielded something more surreal than realistic. Therefore, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad doesn't necessarily display natural flesh tones, but something more in line with what one would expect from a Technicolor production.

In fact, most of what we see today when Technicolor films are remastered are color palettes that are toned down to be more in line with what audiences today expect to see. I'm not certain Sinbad is even as hyper-saturated as it should be, but it looks well enough reproducing the film's colorful Middle Eastern garb and bright, sunny blue skies.

The Sound

Sony continues their trend of providing multiple language tracks on their Blu-ray releases with The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.  In this case there are two lossless options in the form of a newly remixed English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack and a French Dolcy TrueHD 5.1 dub as well as the original English mono soundtrack and a Thai Dolby Digital 5.1 dub. The new lossless English 5.1 mix offers a slightly more expansive soundfield that lets the score by Bernard Hermann breathe, exposing more of its intricate instrumentation. The dialogue is well balanced, if a bit harsh, and intelligible while the film's action sequences are lively with subtle use of the LFE to provide some much needed weight to the otherwise thin sound.

The original mono soundtrack is also rather good, if obviously less engulfing. It is well balanced with good dynamics, clear dialogue, and ample low frequencies.  Sadly, instead of utilizing soley the center channel for a true monaural 1.0 configuration, Sony has provided the soundtrack in a Dolby 2.0 configuration. Still, it is good to have the original mix represented on this release.

The Extras

The 7th Voyage of Sinbad offers an abundance of exploratory supplemental materials that offer much insight into the work of both Ray Harryhausen and his longtime collaborator, composer Bernard Herrmann. Fans of film history, special effects and Harryhausen should be pleased by the wealth of informative extras available here.

The extras available on this release are:

Commentary with Ray Harryhausen, visual effects experts Phil Tippet and Randall William Cook, author Steven Smith, and Arnold Kunert -- The men offer very detailed information on the filmmaking and stop-motion animation process as the film goes by in a very conversational manner. Ray Harryhausen, in particular, offers up many informative anecdotes about the film's production. One interesting bit of trivia that can be gleaned form the audio commentary is the fact that Harryhausen had not actually met the film's young actor Richard Eyer (The Genie) until only a couple of years ago. Because of the scheduling, all of the location filming in Spain, where Harryhausen was, used a young Spanish double in his Eyer's place, while Eyer did all of his filming on the set in the US with director Nathan Juran.
Remembering The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1.78:1/standard definition) -- Ray Harryhausen reminisces on the production of Sinbad and his inspiration for doing the film. In the process, he offers up much information on the special effects techniques he employed during the filming.
The Harryhausen Legacy (1.78:1/standard definition)-- John Landis and many visual effects artists speak of Harryhausen's influence on their work.
The Music of Bernard Herrmann (1.78:1/standard definition) -- Music historian Steve Smith offers up an historical account of the legendary composer's music and tells of how he and Ray Harryhausen first came to collaborate.
Photo Gallery -- A montage of stills from The 7th Voyage of Sinbad set to the film's score by Bernard Hermann.
""Sinbad May Have Been Bad, But He's Been Good to Me"" Music Video -- A promotional 45rpm recording created for the 1958 holiday season release ad campaign for Sinbad. The song is played back to a montage of promotional posters.
A Look Behind the Voyage (4:3/standard definition) -- This is an archival television documentary on the career of Ray Harryhausen.
This is Dynamation (Special Effects) (4:3/standard definition) -- A classic 1958 promo highlighting the film's special effects.
Ray Harryhausen -- Interviewed by Director John Landis (4:3/standard definition) -- John Landis interviews Ray Harryhausen in what is am ore a friendly discussion in which Landis it is obvious that Landis holds Harryhausen in very high esteem. Harryhausen once again details much of the techniques he used in the filming of The 7th Voyage of Sinbad and many of his other films.

453434,3,6302309506,"Perhaps I was five or six when I first snuck into one of the cheapo movie theaters off of Myrtle Ave, in Queens, to see The 7th Voyage Of Sinbad. Or, perhaps I saw it first on WABC-TV's The 4:30 Movie, or late night, on Chiller Theater or Creature Feature. Regardless of when I first saw it, I was immediately hooked on the Ray Harryhausen special effects. Even in this day of CGI effects, I still prefer the older films, replete with blue screens that outlined actors against projected wonders, matte paintings, and stop motion photography. No, this is not a typical middle age belief that things were better in `ye olden days.' The computer graphics these days are far better and smoother than Harryhausen's antiquated system. But, it was the very artificiality of those effects that made them all the more scary, for dreams and nightmares are not mere reflections of reality, but refractions or distortions of reality, where things ripple, don't quite make sense, and are just a bit off. This more aptly describes the Harryhausen monsters, whose movements are a bit more herky-jerky (technically known as strobing) than those conjured up in the cyberworld for the screen. Thus, for me, those films will always be truer and scarier nightmares because of their very artifice.
  There is no logic to much of the film, but it is a hoot, and has not an ounce of pretension in it. Who cares if the magician, who can animate skeletons, would seem to have no real use for a genie? Who cares if the genie could have wiped out the monsters and magician easily, if commanded, since he so easily moves the prolific Cyclops' treasure? Who cares if the Princess's father is ready to declare war on the Caliph of Baghdad for shrinking his daughter, when clearly the magician is to blame? And, who cares if the acting is all 100% cheeseball? B film hunk Kerwin Mathews, as Sinbad, is vapid and hammy, spouting off silly apothegms like, `Allah knows many ways of dealing with hungry men.' Perfect. Sexy Kathryn Grant- soon to marry Bing Crosby, is also perfectly ridiculous as an All-American Arab Princess Parisa. The only one of the three main characters that comes off with a modicum of respectability for his art is Torin Thatcher, as Sokurah the bald cross-eyed magician.
  Yet, the real star of the 87 minute film, aside from Harryhausen's monsters, is the fantastic blaring brass score by Bernard Herrmann, in one of his best non-Hitchcock projects. From the first scene of the film, the viewer is sent on a thrill ride which, aside from a twenty or so minute lull in Baghdad, before the return Colossa, is truly non-stop. The soundtrack to the film even became a bestselling album in its day. Yet, the most frightening moment in the film comes not from anything actually seen onscreen, but when a storm rages at sea and the shrill chirping of unseen monsters drives Sinbad's criminal mutineers insane. Oddly enough, the sound seems to have been recapitulated a decade later by Stanley Kubrick in his coda for 2001: A Space Odyssey, after astronaut Dave Bowman descends into the infinite black obelisk around Jupiter, and has a phantasmagoric experience.
  Movies such as this are terrific precisely because they are not great and they are not `cinema.' They are brief excursions from the dullness and frustrations of reality, and nothing more. As such, and almost half a century on, The 7th Voyage Of Sinbad still succeeds in that mission as well as any other film ever to lighten human eyes. There are certainly far worse claims one could make for Arabs these days.",1221868800,2,3560,4.780487804878049

453461,5,6302309506,"I saw ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" at the Granada theater in Mt. Vernon, IL in 1958 so my perspective may be swayed by that. The only thing that has blown me out of my seat as this did as a child was ""Star Wars"" when I first saw it in the Creve Couer, Missouri theater in 1977 as an adult. As a child I absolutely loved this version of Sinbad. As an adult I'm still very impressed with it's longevity. Kerwin Mathews was a master at seeing creatures that weren't really there, Ray Harryhausen was a master at making creatures of all sorts come to life, and Bernard Hermann made the best fantasy music I have ever heard. I highly recommend this for small children and any one of any age that enjoys old style sword and sorceror or Arabian movies.

I have been a fan of Charles H. Schneer, Ray Harryhausen, and Bernard Herrmann for years. When you put the three together you end up with a magnificent movie where the special effects and music are far above the B movies they are typically lumped with. Kerwin Mathews was great at interacting without an actor there. He made you feel he actually visualized the creatures he saw or fought in these fantastic fantasy movies. This movie has some of the best creatures Harryhausen ever created. I am particular fond of his rendition of a cyclops that looks part beast and hunts men to eat them. Scary but magical this movie is great for the whole family, because the best fairytales are scary.

This 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition is almost perfect. Had they cleaned up the 1986 restored version of the ocassional graininess throughout the movie I would have been ecstatic. I am still quite happy I got this Blu-ray version because the menu interface and the loads of special features are well worth having. Along with the standard features in previous versions you are sure to find something new. Even the photograph section is well done with Herrmann's music. Great quality DVD with lots of extras and great replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""Mysterious Island"".

I love all of his work and the Ymir(from 20 Million Miles to Earth) is my favorite RH creature, but the Cyclops and Dragon are the definitive versions for me in movie history! This is a great fantasy adventure film,with marvelous special effects. If you are young and are not familiar with Ray Harryhausen's work, long before there were CGI creatures they had to create these monster's 3 dimensionally and no one did it better than Mr. Harryhausen! Willis O'Brien may get the credit for creating Stop Motion,but Ray(having been influenced greatly by seeing King Kong)perfected it! There is a quality that is lost with CGI that Ray acheived with his creatures. These films may seem dated to some now,but they are treasured by those of us that grew up with them!

453463,5,6302309506,"Sadi the waiting woman seems to be the only real character here in so much she is not in love with anyone, but holds allegiance to her princess's welfare. I dunno, there aren't many likeable characters in this well done Sinbad/ Harryhausen spectacle. For one, Kerwin Matthews plays the hero, but his constant concern and infatuation with the princess yet to be wed is almost disgusting. Especailly since Kerwin himself was a gay man in real life, his overabundance of focused love just seems like drivel. ""The city is made beautiful by your presence."" What's that over there, the Taj Mahal? Oh, puleeze.
The evil sorcerer comes across as evil, but bumbling. The shiphands hired from the prison walls are truely dispicable. The princess is jaw droppingly syrupy with love and emotion for her fellow man. Not real.
Enter the set designers, production crew, and special effects artist Ray Harryhausen to become the real saviors to this mechanical mess of stereotypes and a drippy love affair.  Bernard Herrmann is also on hand to give Harryhausen's once in a lifetime creatures thier fair due with his dynamic orchestrational music composition. In the end, its the technical department that rules this production and gives this movie the basis for glory, that the general actors cannot.

2006 and I still can't. What this movie is to me is a place in

my heart and being a avid collector of films from the silents

to the classics and obscure I find that very meaningful. If you

have not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly is a funtastic

film. I put this above Jason and the argonauts for my reason

alone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE

monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASON

is his fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has above

Jason for me is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has always

been a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has that

extra push on Jason. Bernard Herrman's score is so dreamlike

you can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is

trancelike especially the snake woman dance. Please anyone

who reads this have 7th voyage in your collection(Jason

& the argonauts too for that matter).You won't be dissapointed

I will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screen

and never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray Harryhausen's

children and Bernard Herrman's music come to life you too

will not forget it. Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of Oz

Casablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78)

E.T. Titanic,2001 a space & Pulp Fiction. Not me! If I was

on a island and could only have one film from my library

have to pick The Seventh Voyage. That would be the one

My only complaint is that the film is presented in a matted format, which compromises the original 1:33-1 aspect ratio that the film was designed for. In a film such as this, where each frame is so carefully designed, this seems a mistake: scenes of the cyclops attack, etc. seem somehow cramped and uncomfortably tight. Compare the print to the (inferior) laserdisc and VHS copies, and you'll notice more information on the other pressings. This issue won't matter to most fans of the film, since the print is so clean and the colors so bright.

453496,5,6302309506,"I watched this film last night, and afterwards I talked to my girlfriend on the phone and she asked me what I did, to which I replied `I watch a Sinbad movie."" And she stated, `Oh, that guy is so funny."" You see, she thought I was referring to the heavyset African American actor/comedian who I equate to be about as funny as Scott 'Carrot Top' Thompson (that's to say both are about as funny as stepping on a board with a nail in it), when, in fact, I was referring to the classic Ray Harryhausen/Charles H. Schneer film The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958)...needless to say she's not my girlfriend anymore...well, okay, she still is, but she's on probation. Co-written by Ken Kolb (""The Wild Wild West"") and Ray Harryhausen, and directed by Nathan Juran (The Brain from Planet Arous, 20 Million Miles to Earth, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman), the film stars Kerwin Mathews (The 3 Worlds of Gulliver, Octaman) and Kathryn Grant (The Night the World Exploded, Operation Mad Ball), who would later be known as Kathryn Crosby, after her marriage to Bing `Der Bingle' Crosby. Also appearing is Richard Eyer (The Invisible Boy), Torin Thatcher (The Crimson Pirate, Jack the Giant Killer), Alec Mango (The Strange World of Planet X), Harold Kasket (Moulin Rouge - the original, not the popular remake), and Alfred Brown (Crack in the World).

The story begins as we see a ship, captained by Sinbad (Mathews), sailing in dense fog with a desperate looking crew (turns out they're in need of food and water). They end up finding an island (later we learn it's named Colossa) and it seems their prayers to Allah have been answered, as the uncharted island is abundant with the supplies they need, along with a few things they don't, like a giant Cyclops, who's presently chasing a strangely garbed man clutching a golden lamp. Sinbad and his men rescue the man, who is a magician named Sokurah, but not before he loses the lamp (butterfingers). Sokurah (who looks a lot like Albert Finney playing Daddy Oliver Warbucks in the 1982 film Annie) wants to go back and fetch his prize, but Sinbad refuses as he's on a mission, one that involves hotfooting it to Baghdad and marrying the comely Princess Parisa (Grant). They make it back all right, but the devious Sokurah surreptitiously casts a shrinky dink spell on the princess and claims the only way to free her from such foul, mysterious, magics is to return to Colossa and retrieve a piece of egg shell from a giant bird. Given no choice, Sinbad must travel back to the island fraught with untold dangers, accompanied by a crew made up mostly of mutinous prisoners (they were offered a pardon if they joined the dangerous journey), a treacherous magician, and a pint sized princess...well, things couldn't get any worse, right? Oh, by the way, I almost forgot, the lamp actually contains a powerful genie that yearns to be a real boy someday, named Pinnoch...er, Baronni (Eyer).

I really enjoyed this movie a lot (Harryhausen's first venture into color films), but I'd only recommend it to people with a sense of imagination willing to overlook some rather minor weaknesses, with an eye towards being entertained by a fantastic story of adventure full of spirit and wonder. I've got nothing against slick computer generated images (CGI), but there was no such thing back when this was made, and Harryhausen's stop motion animation was the cutting edge, bringing to life stories and characters that would have been especially difficult (if not impossible) to present otherwise...heck, I still think his work stands up incredibly well, and it should be known that great many popular effects artists of the present day actually got into the business specifically because of Harryhausen's influential work...besides, who goes into a movie like this expecting realism? It's a fantasy adventure epic, for crying out loud. I don't mean to sound all preachy, but I find it annoying that some people are critical of certain aspects of this film, especially in comparing it to films made in the present day. Certainly everyone's entitled to his or her own opinion, but to casually dismiss the ingenuity and the overall desire to entertain inherent within a film like this (something rarely found in films of today) indicates a disconnection within from that what keeps us young, specifically ones sense of imagination, escapism, and wonder, and for that, I feel sorry, as once that's gone, how can one enjoy the simplest of pleasures life has to offer? Anyway, in case you're wondering, here's the creature lowdown...there's a giant Cyclops (perhaps more than one), a snake woman, an overgrown, two-headed, eagle-like bird and her two-headed offspring, a sword fighting skeleton, and a ginormous fire-breathing dragon. The acting, particularly in the supporting cast, may not be the tops, I thought the principal players did very well. Kerwin Mathews may have looked a little too `western' to pass for a native Baghdonian, but he did especially well putting forth the spirit and liveliness of the character, along with doing a remarkable job relating to the special effects...keep in mind the scenes where he had to fight some creature he was actually fighting nothing, as those special effects were added after shooting was completed. Probably the sequence I enjoyed best was the one where Sinbad fought the animated skeleton. I also liked Kathryn Grant as the diminutive (for a good part of the film) Princess Parisa as she was a hot little number, but I still wouldn't have wanted her feet on my grapes (see the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about). Torin Thatcher did very well as the villain, but I did feel his character was a little restrained...but then again I guess I'm used to over the top villain characterizations in fantasy films. It was odd as normally the villain's motivation in a film like this is his desire for the lead female character, but that wasn't the case here. Sokurah could have cared less for the princess, as his only desire was power. Also, I thought it odd the genie should appear so young, as I'm used to large, bald figures in this role. Baronni hardly seemed the powerful genie he was made out to be...in one scene Sinbad and the princess are fleeing and Sokurah knocks a bridge out...Sinbad calls upon the genie for help, to which the genie gives him a rope...why not rebuild the bridge? Or transport them back to the ship? I guess I'll never understand the extent of genie powers. Overall this is an excellent film, full of exotic locations, beautiful costumes, a strong, fast paced story, lots of swashbuckling adventure, fantastic creatures, complimented perfectly by Bernard Herrmann's rousing musical scoring.

The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes through clear and defined. There's a healthy assortment of extras including an image display of an original theatrical poster, two interview segments with special effects creator Ray Harryhausen titled `A Look Behind the Voyage' (11:45) and `Jason and the Argonauts' (11:47), two featurettes titled `This is Dynamation' (3:26) and `The Ray Harryhausen Chronicles' (57:53), talent files, and a whole mess of trailers, including one for this film, along with 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), The 3 Worlds of Gulliver (1960), Jason and the Argonauts (1963), and It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955).

Hadn't seen this one in decades and had forgotten much of the plot.  Interestingly there wasn't much there, the baddy is not as notable as the Golden Voyage or the Eye of the Tiger, but oh that Cyclops and Dragon!  A bit sad to see the Roc baby barbequed, but the prisoner/crew got their comeuppance when mom got home.  Sinbad is blackmailed into getting the magician's genie lamp.  The magician had shrunk the betrothed princess so it's off to the isle of Colossi with a crew of prisoners.  Hmm, mutiny possibilities anyone?  Fortunately the formula would be perfected in later Sinbad films, this one lacks a bit.

453499,2,6302309506,"Ok.  Let me be honest.  I saw this movie recently.  For free. I want the time I wasted on this overrated piece of junk back.  Why do all of the high ratings I am seeing exist?  Because of the ""superb"" acting??  The ""amazing"" special effects?  I think not...these things simpy did not exist.  Just because people may have grown up with this movie certainly DOES NOT make it a good movie on its own.  The acting was horrible!  As a theater minor in college, I can honestly say I know what I am talking about; however, I think that any sane person would agree with me in saying that the acting was absolutely horrendous.  The dialogue was cheesy, unrealistic, and most certainly stereotypical of any old ""classic"" that everyone seems to love. The fight scenes were pathetic - Sinbad throws perhaps the worst punches I have ever seen in my life, and the weakest sword strikes possible.  All of his lines seemed too dramatic for its moment in the movie, and his lines simply did not seem genuine.  I felt like I was looking at someone reading off a script for the first time. I am not even going to start on the Princess.  Weeeee!!!!

Perhaps I am being too mean.  I could see how, a young child at the age of 1-8 years old could enjoy, or perhaps love this movie.  I can understand that, for its time, the special effects were great.  However, I cannot understand how ANYONE could say the acting was good in the least.  Or the musical score for that matter.  I felt like my ears were going to be blown off by the high, dog whistle like sounds.

Let me say a few other things.  I honestly think that if this movie was remade today - by perhaps Spielburg or someone such as Tim Burton - and the dialogue changed - it would be a very interesting and exciting film.  Get some better actors and actresses, modern special effects, and perhaps a darker tone and you have a summer blockbuster.  People would go to see it based on nostalgia of the original alone.

But I must say one more thing.  The fact that I gave this movie two stars comes from its story, and its ""ehhh"" special effects.  Yes, for its time, it was good.  But it is now, not then.  Special effects such as those simply cannot garner such high ratings from any sane person, especially due to so many other negative aspects of this movie.  I think that anyone over the age of 8 who sees this movie for the first time will be thouroughly disappointed - but not as disappointed as me.  Come on people, don't give ratings based on nostalgia.  Give ratings based on quality.",1100217600,7,2526,4.365591397849462
453500,5,6302309506,"Even with the current state of digital special effects the stop-motion miniatures of Dynamation, also called Dynarama, are incredible.  It is amazing to see the kind of magic that special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen was able to wrest from his miniatures.  When wires were required to support certain features I was unable to find them even when searching for them.

This 1958 movie was the first of three Sinbad movies for which Ray Harryhausen created special effects.  However, as has been said by many others, Harryhausen's special effects often did as much acting as the actors themselves, showing emotions and often intent, and the blend of special effects and live acting turns movies such as this into a viewing experience.

In this movie Sinbad (Kerwin Matthews) is on a quest to find the egg of a Roc to return his love Princess Parisa (Kathryn Grant, soon to be Mrs. Crosby at that time), who has been reduced to miniature size, back to her full height.  Sokurah the Magician (Torin Thatcher), who needs a piece of Roc egg in order to restore the Princess to her full height, sent Sinbad on this quest.  Only the audience knows that Sokurah reduced the Princess to force Sinbad to go on the quest.  Sokurah's ulterior motive is that a magic lamp containing a genie is on the same island as the Roc egg, and Sokurah plans to obtain the lamp during the quest.

During the quest to find the Roc egg we meet a cloven-hoofed Cyclops, a full grown two-headed Roc and a Roc chick, a marvelously animated dragon, and an incredible skeleton in a fight sequence with outstanding human actor interface.

While this movie is rated G, I recall when I was much younger that it was movies such as these that generated more than one nightmare, so you may want to consider whether younger members of the family should be permitted to watch this movie.

The DVD also contains several excellent features for Ray Harryhausen fans.  There is a feature titled the ""Ray Harryhausen Chronicles"" that is an interview with Ray that includes an overview of his life along with a variety of film clips and stills.  Also included are portions of his first storybook shorts, including the final one that he started, ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" but never completed.  I thought the Ray Harryhausen related features were worth the value of the DVD alone.  However, I have been a Harryhausen fan since the 60s.

The special effects featurette ""This is Dynamation"" is suitably campy and reminded me of the over-hyped style of 50s movies.  Viewers whose primary language is Thai, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean will find subtitles available.

This DVD has a lot to offer to fans of Ray Harryhausen, stop-motion photography, fantasy, and Sinbad.  This DVD is also contained in the ""Sinbad Collection,"" which includes Harryhausen's other two Sinbad movies and offers a reduced price per DVD for the three DVD set.",1096761600,5,2899,4.831983805668016

453531,5,6302309506,"If you love classic films and you love special effects, then you are undoubtedly passionate about the films of legendary Ray Harryhausen, and this is one of his best.  In this movie, Harryhausen uses his stop-motion technique in color for the first time (and the print here is terrific) to tell the tale of Sinbad (Kerwin Mathews) as he sails the seas, forms an uneasy alliance with an evil magician (Torin Thatcher) and battles a Cyclops, a two-headed Roc and a dragon.  Other memorable effects include the genie Berani and the interior of his magic lamp, the Princess Parisa being shrunk and the servant woman who is turned into a dancing half-woman, half-snake.  The action starts right away and continues throughout the film, and Bernard Herrmann's music is, as always, absolutely perfect.

DVD extras are excellent, and include: a picture of the original poster; trailers from other Harryhausen features; two interview featurettes, each 12 minutes long; a 3-minute featurette about the Dynamation process; and a one-hour feature about Ray Harryhausen.  This is a great package -- and for you enthusiastic polyglots out there, the film can be heard in English, Spanish or Portuguese, while subtitles are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean or Thai!

Having small children who are becoming interested in ""scary movies"", I've found that the Harryhausen ouevre is a great way for them to find thrills and chills without gore, and a wonderful way for me to reconnect with my childhood joys as well.  The whole family has a great time watching these terrific films.  I'm really glad they're being re-released in such high quality and with such interesting dvd extras.

Stop-action animation has a dated look now, but but it goes with the costuming and sets of the time. The sword-fighting skeleton, the cylcops, dragon, Roc, and minor figures are all incredible achievements. It takes a very special kind of eye to see natural motion and break that into cel-length pieces, but Harryhausen had that knack. Harryhaussen was also central in developing the camera and photo-composition techniques needed, and probably still used today.

I watched with wide-eyed wonder as the snake woman, the Cyclops, the gigantic two-headed Roc, and the fire-breathing Dragon, creatures that even my young mind knew existed only in the imagination, came to vivid life on the screen. The monsters' scenes remained a childhood memory more vivid than anything else I had seen on TV or in the movies. Then, some 10 years later, we got our first vcr, a beta. At the neighborhood video rental store, I chanced upon this title. I thought, what the hell, I'll rent this just for kicks, it should be fun. But as I watched it again, I found myself reliving my childhood wonder and awe. Not exactly a just-for-kicks viewing experience. Now, 20 more years later, I'm the proud owner of a DVD copy of The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. The film, digitally transferred with remarkable sharpness and clarity, remains as spectacular as it was way back in 1958. The cast is still impressive, the costumes realistic, and the sets and locations awesome.  But of course, the real stars are the monsters, brought to three-dimensional life by the undisputed master of stop-motion animation, Ray Harryhausen.

453537,5,6302309506,"Ray Harryhausen is *the* Special FX God, can I just get that out of the way? I am a colossal nostalgia freak and this is one of a very select few movies that live up to the years of hype generated from childhood memory. Not uncoincidently, most of those select movies are Harryhausen pictures.
7th has always had a special place in my heart and I'm not sure why. It could be that Kerwin Mathews is the best actor B-level monster movies has ever had, and his Sinbad is neither riddled with massive amount of hair or saddled with a bad accent. Perhaps it's because the villain is manipulative and clever, and the creatures roaming his island are some of the best and most seamlessly edited in you'll ever see. Or it could be the jaw-dropping dragon, with his swirly antelope horns and personality enhancing eyebrow ridges. Yeah...it's probably the dragon.
Neither the story nor the production values have been ravaged by time, although some of the mano-y-mano fight scenes are a bit suspect (Um, why is Sinbad stabbing people with his fist, and how come the Princess doesn't suffocate or get squashed?). But even those questions don't hamper the movie so much as give you little things to look for.
The disc itself is a treasure chest of bonuses. I'd seen the 'Chronicles' when it aired on AMC but the Leonard Maltin interview (Oddly, about 'Jason and the Argonauts') was interesting and it was fun to read the talent files, which are usually a bore, and flip through the old promo pics and movie posters. The two standouts are the cornucopia of original trailers, which are of the lion's share of Harryhausen's films, and the 'Look Behind the Voyage' featurette that gave me all sorts of random trivia and even more things to look for the next time I watch the movie itself.

That video has great color and a killer soundtrack that is not only fantastic in sound,but also separates with surroundsound,something the video box never said it had until it was released again with the cover that the dvd has as well and claims it as a pristine remaster. Not only was the sound not up to snuff,but the color looks alittle more faded than the video as well. In fact the only thing going for the dvd is the little booklet that the Harryhausen fantasy films seem to have with the dvd case with some pictures from the film that haven't been shown a hundred times before,such as the small one of the dragon coming out of the cave to fight the cyclops. Then again,maybe thats the real reason I got the dvd in the first place,as one other reviewer also had complained that it was not in stereo as the laser disc used to be,and the vhs video obviously still is recorded in.

THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is one of my all time favorite fantasy movies.  I would count this, along with the silent version of THE THIEF OF BAGDAD starring Douglas Fairbanks and the 1940 remake with Sabu as the three greatest Arabian Nights adventure films ever made.  What makes 7TH VOYAGE stand out among the three, however, are Ray Harryhausen's wonderful stop-motion effects.
While there are some who consider the monsters in this movie ""fake looking"", for me, I actually prefer to watch this style rather than overblown video game-like effects that CGI offers us.  Harryhausen's creatures have much more personality.  I actually felt sorry for the Cyclops when he gets killed by the Dragon.  Ditto for the Dragon when he gets killed by the large cross-bow.
Kerwin Mathews, to me IS Sinbad.  Every time the name ""Sinbad"" comes up, I always have to  think of Kerwin Mathews.  Kathyrn Grant is truly beautiful as the Princess.  I also like Richard Eyer as the boy genie.  Torin Thatcher, as the evil sorcerer Sokurah, is one of my favorite movie characters of all time.

It seems that spfx have evolved to the point where soon people are going to completely lose interest in films like this. Thats a shame because I cant think of a better movie for an entire family to sit down and enjoy together.
The thrill of Ray Harryhausen movies isn't that you will see something ""real"" but that you will see something you've never seen before. For 90 minutes you can pop your popcorn,park your brain,and enjoy an adventure that pulls you in from the opening shot and doesnt let go until the ending credits roll.
I cant find any fault with this film. From the spfx,to the acting,to the set pieces-even the music adds to the enjoyment of your viewing experience. Rays' passion for his craft really translates well onto the screen in this movie. Forget those artsy fartsy films-this is true cinematic art.
For you monster lovers;here's what you get...a cyclops;a fire-breathing dragon;a two-headed vulture;a sword-wielding skeleton and a dancing snake-lady.

453564,5,6302309506,"The CYCLOPS in The Schneer/Harryhausen/Juran/Hermann
""SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD"" (the first one we meet)
is and always will be the best ever monster of all movies.
That Ray H. could wring such a range of emotion and character out of his creation
(and that working solo - no ILM in those Dynamation Days of Yore!)
is a testimony to his talent, determination and genius.
That this monster should appear early in the long line of COLOR
movie monsters makes it a prototype as well as an archetype.
Mark well: the balance in the thing's WALK; the body language in the TALK; the cocking of the HEAD; the licking and sneering of the LIPS; the blinking and staring of THE EYE! I can only testify to the power of this monster on (1) the big screen - I saw ""Sinbad"" several times as an eight-year-old at the theater - and (2) on VHS - my copy has been shared with literally DOZENS of kids (all under ten!) on many a television set. {{BUT I promise: if and when I purchase a DVD player, it will be, first of all, to see the AMAZON DVD of ""7th""!}}
Finally, the pathos elicited in the cyclops in its coveting of the treasure (the lamp in particular) and in its inglorious death
combine to top KING KONG and Frankenstein's monster in the INhuman, truly unique and 'monsteriffic' behavior department.
There will never be another like the cyclops of Colossa!
PAEANS, homage and KUDOS to those who brought CYCLOPS to the screen and to our eyes, ears, and hearts!

453565,5,6302309506,"I, like one other reviewer, saw this movie as a child.  One of the best scenes in all of motion picture history is the scene where the cyclops moves the entire roof off of his treasure hoard and we see the monstrous face leering in, from the perspective of Sinbad and his crew, who are trapped below.  I've seen it probably 20 times.  Bernard Herrmann's score is fantastic.  At the beginning it sets the stage for what is soon to come.  And it ain't pretty.",1004054400,2,457,4.329411764705882

From the world past hope and fear,
I bid you Genie now appear.""
I always get goosebumps everytime I watch this movie. Suddenly I'm 8 years old again. The stop motion ""Dynamation"" is still amazing. Ray Harryhausen's ground breaking and painstaking effects defined every fantasy and science fiction film to come. However as an adult there are some ""gaffs"" in the production that can cause some unintentional humor. The first thing is Sinbad's ship.  If you look closely it is three different ships. One of my favorite scenes is where the mini-princess helps Sinbad escape from the Cyclops'cage by pushing a giant cork off the trap door latch. The next shot shows Sinbad flinging the door open that the Princess a moment before was standing upon. All in all a classic of the genre.",1001894400,2,809,4.820143884892087
453567,5,6302309506,"A very cool movie, with lots of fighting which I like.  Sinbad, played by Kerwin Mathews, seems to me kind of Indian instead of a man from Baghdad.  When I first saw the movie, I liked it.  When my dad came home, I was anxious to tell him about it.",997315200,2,248,3.92
453568,5,6302309506,"I played the movie for my 4 years old son and he was just hypnotized by the opening scene where the cyclop fights Sinbad's men. I can't count how many times I have played this movie for him and yet he keeps asking for more.
This is great entertainment for children ( specially younger ones). Of course, now i have a good argument to start all over my Sinbad collection, now in DVD.",987724800,2,381,4.232876712328767
7824303,5,6302309506,"Not just a classic film but a wonderful and fun movie, at times it may be too intense for small children but otherwise a treat for all. Let us not forget the effects of Ray Harryhausen who at the time was an innovator to the Nth degree. Kerwin Matthews plays Sinbad and as far as I am concerned he is the only Sinbad. The support cast and the story are excellent. this movie is simply a pleasure to watch.",1526169600,,405,4.139240506329114
