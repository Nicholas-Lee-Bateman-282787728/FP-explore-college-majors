798311,3,6304119003,"When I was a kid, I used to watch the Super Scary movies every Saturday night, at 11:30 p.m., and when this one came up, I had no idea that it was taking place out in the Old West.
I stayed up and watched it and was surprised that they put together a decent story about a vampire stalking a ranch. Years later, when it came on the Sci-Fi channel, I thought enough of it to tape it and add it to my collection.",974678400,7,409,3.880952380952381
798312,5,6304119003,"I'm giving this movie 5 stars because for its time it was great. Plus it shows Eric Fleming in his unpolished but still spectacular beginnings, shortly before his rising talent was cut short by a freak accident  (drowning). It was a tragic loss of someone who certainly might have  equalled John Wayne or Clint Eastwood (after all, he was the REAL star of  Rawhide).",945734400,9,366,4.6875

798403,5,6304119003,"""Curse Of The Undead"" is so good. It is an unusual western. This particular movie is not your run of the mill western format story.""Curse Of The Undead"" is similar to an early 1970s made for television drama called ""Black Noon"" with Roy Thinnes. If you are an Eric Fleming fan and you like unknown fare,then get this movie. I transferred the vhs tape to a dvd and it turned out real nice.",1370217600,2,388,4.328767123287672

798405,5,6304119003,"I have had this old movie in my vhs vault for a while and it is one of my favorite old horror movies. It is akin to Billy the Kid vs. Dracula in that it is a Vampire / Western. They didn't make too many of those at any time in movie history but these two were great. The Acting is par for this kind of movie as is the plot. Unlike Billy the Kid vs. Dracula the vampire in this one is a quick draw gunslinger who isn't too worried even if he does get shot because hey, He's a vampire! What better life could there be in the old west. His eyesight isn't too good in the day though. This movie comes from a great moment in movie history when actors actually had to act because they didn't have 50 million dollars worth of CGI's or special effects. Great Movie.",1306454400,9,757,3.986842105263158
798406,5,6304119003,"If your into Universal Horror then you'll love this.
It's a mix a horror and western but very well made.
Eric Fleming is great as the sheriff and Michael
Palin is in many universal movies as the 2nd bad
man or evil guy. He's perfect as the vampire who
comes into town and goes on his blood thristy
killing spree. Disguised as a gunman he can't
be killed until the Sheriff discovers his secret.
Why this isn't on dvd I can't figure out. I have
had the dvd for years and watch often. I see the
price for video is quite expensive so I'd look
for cheaper copy or dvd copy. I have seen them.",1303776000,9,586,4.104347826086957
798407,4,6304119003,"A vampire western?! Yep. And it works.

It features a non-traditional vampire who is actually closer to the old legends than the vast majority of movie vampires. It features a sympathetic villain who nevertheless undeniably deserves what happens to him. It has an interesting conflict between good and evil in which it is obvious where the champions of both stand while also showing that neither is a paragon, making them quite human.

I like this movie. A lot. I've told friends about it. Now that I've bought the tape I can show it to them. :-)",1226793600,4,546,4.677083333333333
798408,4,6304119003,"I picked up this ""classic"" at a thrift store for a buck.  Such a deal I got!

This is one weird little western.  I am a horror movie fan and was surprised I had never heard of it.  It's easy to see why, though.  It is a gothic horror story--a pretty standard one, really--that takes place in a traditional western setting.

My wife and I were rooting for the vampire to get the girl, though we both knew that was not going to happen.  It was just a matter of HOW the preacher was going to kill the undead gunslinger.

Well worth your time.",1197936000,4,539,4.115384615384615
798409,2,6304119003,"Altho not a good film, this effort from the very end of Universal's SF/horror cycle deserves a footnote for establishing, more or less, the minor sub-genre of the horror western.  (There actually had been a few films in the Thirties which fit into this category, but they were forgotten by virtually everyone until being released on home video.)  Michael Pate (a sort of sinister James Coburn) is effective in the role of a vampire menacing folks on a ranch.  This particular vampire is perfectly capable of walking around in the sunshine (hey, no fair!) and the fact that the climactic destruction of the vampire takes place in broad daylight greatly lessens the film's effect.  Worth a look for horror fans, however.",1038700800,4,718,4.909090909090909
798410,5,6304119003,"Great horror film (also known as ""Mark of the West) coming at the end of Universal's Horror/Scifi period.  There are no giant bats, howling dogs, torch bearing villagers or black capes in this unique vampire tale. There is, however, an eerie, hair rising score by Irvin Gertz and a nontraditional background for a horror film.  Taking place in the old, wild west we are introduced to a vampire, played by Michael Pate,  who can walk around bathed in the full strength of the sun (without erupting into flames) and  only uses a coffin for those occasional naps.",1019260800,9,560,4.742268041237113

7863563,5,6304119003,"This is an unusual twist on the Classic Vampire story!
And done within the trappings of a Western!
And done Seriously as well!
Curse of the Undead should have been included in the Universal studios Legacy Collection of Horror films.
That was released over 10 years ago!
There are other Universal horror films that also should be released on DVD as well! Such as Supernatural with Norma Sherer!",1504656000,2,393,4.794117647058823
7863564,2,6304119003,"Curse of the Undead, 1959 film

A couple in a horse-drawn wagon arrive at a house to visit a sick woman. Young girls are suffering from an illness. Late at night she expires. Two small wounds are found on her throat! A ranch owner has dammed a stream to deprive others of water so he can get their lands. The doctor complains to the sheriff about his sons beating for asking for water. The big ranch owner Buffer has hired guns working for him. The sheriff orders him to release the water, he says he did that. Something happens. Doc Carter has been killed. There are marks on his throat. Will someone visit his coffin at night?

Carters son Tim plans revenge against Buffer and drinks a lot. Their insults lead to a shooting, one dies. Carters girl Dolores posts signs to hire a gunman. The sheriff tears them down. One man picks up a sign and reads it. Will he take the job? He is fast with a gun. A challenger loses and pays a penalty. Drake Robies visits Miss Carter and is given lodgings. There is a full moon that night. Minister Dan rebukes Buffer. Can they drive Robie out of town? Minister Dan visits Dolores, who feels cold, and tells her of the deal. She fires Robie, who leaves. But he returns at night; he suffers from bright sunlight and wants to work at night.

Minister Dan reads the old records about the Carter ranch and learns about its history or murder and suicide. Could a vampire attack the young girls of the village? Dolores walks in the night, the sheriff meets her an complains about Robie. Later the sheriff is attacked. What killed him? Robie visits the Minister to converse. There is a fight! The Minister tells Dolores about the vampire. But she doesnt believe him. They go to a mausoleum and open a coffin. It is empty! Later Robie arrives to find Dolores on the floor and carries her home.

Robie shows Dolorw an old map that proves the stream is on her land. Then he goes into town and meets Buffer. Buffer draws on Robie first but loses. Robie tells Dolores what happened. What can the Minister do? Robie goes into town and meets Dan, who plans to open the coffins at that mausoleum. This results in a duel, the Minister wins because of his special bullet! Will there be a happy ending now? [Isnt it very unusual to have a mausoleum in a frontier wester town?]

A good movie needs a good story, and this just doesnt have it. The story of a big rancher trying to grab the water rights and lands from small ranchers could have made a good story, it occurred in other westerns. Look up the Johnson County War of 1892 for the historical example. Adding a vampire cowboy is a novelty but doesnt make a good story.",1501977600,,2643,4.396728016359918
7863565,4,6304119003,"CURSE OF THE UNDEAD (aka: AFFAIRS OF A VAMPIRE, MARK OF THE WEST) is a horror / western, from 1959. It involves vampirism in the old west, complete w/ victims drained of blood, and plenty of atmospheric woo-woo music! It's sort of like watching an episode of a typical TV western from the period, w/ the vampire elements added in for fun. Does it work? Well, yes, it does. It's obvious who the bloodsucker is, as he's shown very early on. We know he's the vampire, because he sits on his horse mysteriously, and said horse moves in slow-motion! We also know, because he sleeps in a coffin! He's Drake Robey (Michael Pate), a gunslinger who just happens to have a taste for the red stuff. Local woman, Dolores Carter (Kathleen Crowley- TARGET EARTH, THE FLAME BARRIER) puts up reward posters in order to get someone to kill whoever murdered her father. He was, of course, found w/ tell-tale holes in his neck. When Robey himself answers the call, he runs afoul of the town preacher (Eric Fleming), setting up a true tale of good vs. eeevil. COTU also has a nice back story, explaining Robey's accursed origin. Though such crossovers would be attempted later, such as the absurd JESSE JAMES MEETS FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER and BILLY THE KID VS. DRACULA (both from 1966), this is certainly one of the better ones...",1501891200,,1310,4.675324675324675

This is the only Fifties Universal horror title not yet released in the U.S. on DVD, although it was once available on VHS. The movie is a curious blend of vampires and gunslingers starring Eric Fleming of ""Rawhide"" fame and a good cast of supporting players.  If you have an all region DVD player this is well worth picking up. English language with removable subtitles, the quality of the picture is topnotch.",1429574400,6,477,4.817073170731708

A vampire gunslinger makes his living, (or dying), going around the West putting the bite on his opponents.  He's brought down by a local preacher, (of course).

7863572,5,6304119003,"I saw this movie in the theater at least twice when it was released in 1959. I was shocked that it is not available in and has never been released in a DVD version. This is a Spanish vampire, not the Eastern European variety most people are acquainted with. This vampire became one because he committed suicide, not because he was killed by one as in the Dracula series. In the Catholic faith, suicide is the ultimate sin and so he becomes one of the undead. There are many other peculiarities of this vampire-he can move around in daylight, for example. Dracula, on the other hand, is destroyed by sunlight. Eric Fleming, in a role he took shortly before the beginning of the western series, ""Rawhide,"" is excellent as a preacher. Michael Pate, that excellent Australian actor familiar to many baby boomers as a villain or Native American, is suitably menacing as the vampire. Universal!!! Please put this out on a DVD!!!!",1372636800,8,923,4.703703703703703
