8090880,5,B000BQ5J36,This is a documentary about drugs and my family is from Juarez Mexico which is where this is based and I was SHOCKED! Good movie!,1455753600,,129,4.2
8090881,2,B000BQ5J36,Both shows suck. Don't waste your money,1447977600,,39,4.714285714285714
8090882,2,B000BQ5J36,"The quality of this DVD indicates it was very quickly assembled.  Besides the poor camera work, it's obvious that very little research into the subject of drug wars was done.  One unacceptable indication of this is when the narrator throughout the entire film repeatedly refers to the most notorious city in the world connected to the drug trade, Medellin Colombia, as ""me-dell-in"" instead of it's proper pronouncement ""me-de-yeen"".  Also a lot of what is covered in this film is covered more accurately and with a much more polished look elsewhere.  If you're interested in the Colombian Drug trade I'd suggest you check out Carlito's Medellin and La Sierra.  Also if you're interested in the Miami-Colombia drug nexus definitely check out Cocaine Cowboys. BTW, the reviewer who said this film deals with Miami drug wars must not be talking about the same movie.  Drug Wars never crosses into any discussion of drugs and the US other than the US being the primary consumers of cocaine and US assistance in eradicating drugs in South America and toppling Pablo Escobar - Miami is never mentioned.  The only pluses of this film if any may be that it discusses the drug trade in some areas other than South America such as Thailand and Burma.",1249257600,,1240,4.876190476190477
8090883,4,B000BQ5J36,"This DVD gives a good snapshot of the drug trade and its effects around the world. It seems at times to be one-sided, but it still portrays the situation accurately. Some of the information is outdated but valid. The narrator obviously does not have any knowledge of the Spanish language or South America in general. At times he mispronounces country names so badly you have no idea what he is talking about. Still it is worth your time and money.",1231804800,3,447,4.6
8090884,5,B000BQ5J36,"True story of the drug wars in Miami in the 1970's. Lots of footage, interviews, etc. A great story of a true drug cartel, if you like Miami Vice, or are interested in crime stories, this is as good as it gets. I have studied the 70's, crime, and law enforcement for many years, and never heard of this operation. It is well worth the time to watch, excellant movie.",1220918400,3,366,4.242857142857143
8090885,5,B000BQ5J36,"This movie has a lot of excellent content and it's well shot, South American aerial views are stunning, the footage from Brazil and surrounding Pablo Escobar's murder are phenomenal. I deeply appreciate the social justice sentiments presented and special features that include ""underground"" footage taken from notorious gang hangouts, interviews with drug vigilantes and a special short about the execution of Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug lord who became one of the richest men in the world by smuggling cocaine.

Good stuff.",1165795200,12,530,5.463414634146342
