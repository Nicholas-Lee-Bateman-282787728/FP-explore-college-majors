2461146,4,B000CEXF8S,"Total Resculpt is a 45 minute workout split into a lower body and upper body sections, each about 20 minutes long containing their own warmup and stretch.  Kendell Hogan leads the workout, he is joined by 7 young gals all who are in great shape.

The lower body section is first, you start with a simple and fun warmup and then you will start ""chiseling"" your lower body with plie squats, there are variations in the count, starting with 2-2 then going into singles, later adding front deltoid raises. You will finish out with a set of 3 down 1 up, then holding at the bottom.  Next are static lunges, you will do single count lunges then you will hold at the bottom and pulse, then finish out with a hold.  I used much lighter weights than I normally use and was surprised at how much I felt this, I expected it to be much easier.  Static lunges are repeated on the other side before going into reverse lunges.  You will do reverse lunges on each side, then you repeat but add a knee lift at the top.  Following this are standing leg extensions while holding the arms out to the side holding light weights, this too was pretty challenging as I used 5 lb weights for these.  After these you will combine all three elements, reverse lunge adding a knee lift then extending the leg, alternating legs.  Finishing out the lower body segment are stiff legged dead lifts, again starting in a 2-2 count then single count.  Then you will do side leg lifts, this time you are holding your arms out in front of you.  You will do these on each side, before combining them with the stiff legged dead lifts.  A brief stretch follows the lower body work.

Upper body is next and it's covered well.  Again you start with a brief warmup, lots of fun though.  You will start with back work,  a variation of a rear deltoid raise with the feet staggered, you will start with a slow count before going to tempo.  Then you will do double arm rows, repeat the rear deltoid series, then you will alternate the double arm rows before finishing out with one arm rows on each side.  Biceps and shoulders are next, starting with hammer curls for the biceps, you will start with both arms then alternate, then repeat.  Then you will work the shoulders with side lateral raises, one side at a time starting with a slower count, then going to tempo.  Back to biceps, this time you will do angled curls with palms up.  You will start by going only halfway down for a set, then you will start at the bottom and come up halfway, then you will combine both of them.  Then you finish the segment with front deltoid raises, alternating arms then adding a cross and a small side step.  Triceps are next, you will start with double arm kickbacks, then alternate the arms, then repeat the two.  Then you do a set of french presses before going back to kickbacks, this time one arm at a time, then you will do one more set of french presses.

To finish out the upper body section you will work shoulders again, starting with upright rows, then overhead presses, and rear deltoid raises, before combining all three.  Then you will move the floor for chest work, starting with pushups, then you will do pec flies, you will do a set with both arms then just one  arms at a time which was pretty challenging.  Then you will finish out with a set of bench presses, later slightly crossing at the wrist for a little added challenge.  A short stretch follows.

I liked this workout more than I thought I would.  Kendell and his crew used one pair of light weights for this workout, light weights are definitely appropriate and recommended here as a lot of the moves are done in combination or one arm at a time to make it tougher.  I used anywhere from 3-8 weights and I felt that I got a good workout.  You won't get big muscles here, definitely a  toning and sculpting workout, but a good one.  Lots of interesting moves to change things up from a traditional weight training routine.  I think that all levels would be suitable for this workout, as long as one is somewhat familiar with the different toning exercises.  Kendell Hogan is a pleasant instructor who is encouraging and seem to be having a good time, he does a nice job here.  Overall, a solid workout by Crunch, good one to choose if you are looking to tone up.",1143676800,51,4279,4.417624521072797
2461147,5,B000CEXF8S,"I am a big Crinch DVD fan, I own 9 DVDs in the series. This is another outstanding addition to the Crunch Catalog. This DVD provides an excellent upper and lower body workout. I am at an intermediate level and I felt this workout, both while doing it AND the day after. The lower body workout is a straightforward lunge and squat workout with weights to add intensity. I really felt this while I was doing it, especially the lunges. And the upper body section is excellent as well. There are a variety of moves, so it's never boring. And believe me, your chest will be hurting the next day! Kendall Hogan is a great instructor; he's motivating without being overly cheery and he made it seem like fun, rather than a workout. And I loved that Catherine and Jennifer from other Crunch videos were in the group as well--they are easy to follow and great demonstrators of good form. There is not really any cardio or abs in this video, but this DVD would be good to alternate with other cardio and ab workouts you may have.",1142812800,9,1019,4.425531914893617
2461148,4,B000CEXF8S,I just did this workout for the first time today.  I've been working out quite some time.  I liked it a lot.  It's broken down into lower body with lots of lunges and squats while holding weights; then an upper body work out that does get the biceps and shoulders fatigued.  I would've given it a higher rating but there's really no abs other than when you're trying to balance on one leg.  The stretches at the end are minimal and you may want to do more.  Run time is about 40 minutes with the warm up and stretch.,1142553600,10,516,4.161616161616162
2461149,5,B000CEXF8S,"I actually bought this from another online source a couple of weeks ago and have enjoyed doing this workout already.  It's not the most challenging ever - that's because it's compacted into a half hour, so there's a lot of ground to cover in this time frame.  You do get a full body workout, but if you are used to doing weight training, you may not find this as effective as beginners to intermediates would.  I personally love it when you don't have a lot of time on your hands, but I wouldn't rely on it for my strength training on a regular basis.  Kendell is a great instructor whose enthusiasm is very contagious.  Even if you don't feel like working out, listening to him for a while will change your mind.  This is a good workout despite it's length, and doing this is better than doing nothing else as you will still feel the burn somewhat for the next day or so.  Oh and one last thing.  If it's meant to be a total body resculpt, it would have been nice to SOMETHING for the abs.",1137369600,33,990,4.25668449197861
2461180,5,B000CEXF8S,"Love this DVD. It's an old one but a good one. Perfect for days when you want to do a lighter weight workout. Nothing too strenuous. The workout is split into two sections, the first focusing on lower body, the second focusing on the upper body. The moves aren't new, but the group of exercisers and the instructor make it fun. Kendell is the fitness world's version of Denzel Washington! Just wish there were more DVDs out there with him instructing.",1436659200,,451,4.580246913580247
2461181,3,B000CEXF8S,It was not a very demanding workout.  I have done step with this instructor and the routine was much better.  I do not think this one will leave it's case very often.,1430870400,,166,4.15625

2461183,1,B000CEXF8S,I was so excited to get this DVD but it either skips or it freezes and does not play. My DVD player is new and other workout videos I receive play fine so it's not my DVDs player. Very disappointed.,1424390400,,198,3.975

2461186,5,B000CEXF8S,"This is a great workout--challenging for people of almost every level of fitness, but not intimidating or too daunting to keep up.  All you need is a pair of fairly light dumbbells (I used 5 lbs in each hand).  Great combo of some aerobic exercise and weight training.  I really liked the instructor--he keep things high energy without being too cheesy and kept a nice variety of moves to keep things from getting boring.  I really didn't feel like working out today but I stuck with the whole program!  This one would be a good DVD to buy because with the different chapters you could change up the workout and keep it fresh.",1396396800,,626,4.504424778761062
2461187,5,B000CEXF8S,"Fun, and it does work to resculpt and get you and keep you in shape, though you have to play it and exercise!",1391212800,,109,3.782608695652174
2461188,3,B000CEXF8S,"I own many fitness DVD's. low impact 30 min sounded good. However, I really only liked the workout by Kendall.  Others may like the other workouts.  So, because I am only using one of the five, it was just ok.",1378080000,,209,4.2
2461189,3,B000CEXF8S,"I realize this is a ""toning"" video, but usually there's a little bit of cardio thrown in there.  Cause let's face it, you have to get the heart rate up to burn off fat and calories so you can see the muscle.  But there is zero cardio in this.  Kendall is highly annoying as well.  I didn't find it particularly hard either - he says a couple of times about fatiguing the muscle to get them sculpted, but even with heavier dumbbells, fatigue didn't happen.  There is also ZERO ab work in this, so I can't call it ""total"" resculpt. It wasn't totally worthless...the upper body segment was ok I guess.  But the lower body wasn't a workout at all.  I'll keep it around for days that I don't have the gusto for a full-on workout.  But it's definitely going to the bottom of the stack.",1377648000,3,779,4.287671232876712
2461230,5,B000CEXF8S,"This is a version of the body pump classes that are currently popular.  It's basic strength training moves with numerous repetitions, all using hand weights.  You can use as much or as little weight as you like to customize it to you.  There is no ab section; it's all lower and/or upper body, which could be broken into two separate workouts if you wanted (runs 45 min total).  No cardio except the warm ups, which are short and not difficult once you get the hang of the moves he puts together.  Overall the workout is simple to do with basic steps, focusing on one muscle group at a time.  The space needed is enough room to do a backward lunge and a forward knee raise.  The instructor is so enthusiastic that I couldn't help but enjoy myself.  I don't usually like really chipper instruction but he wasn't overboard and was genuinely enjoying himself.  His entourage is made up of all gorgeous women, which made me roll my eyes a little since they were all eye candy.  I suppose it's to motivate me to want to look like them.  I'd put this at a beginner to moderate workout (Jillian Michaels being the difficult end of that spectrum).",1377043200,,1139,4.480582524271845
2461231,5,B000CEXF8S,THIS PRODUCT WAS IN NEW CONDITION AND I LOVE IT.THIS INSTRUCTOR IS EASY TO FOLLOW AND THE WORKOUT IS NOT TO STRENUOUS,1374883200,,117,4.363636363636363
2461232,4,B000CEXF8S,He was on a DVD that came with my curl bar workout like 12 years ago--very energetic & motivating if not a little old school.,1373587200,,125,4.04

*I LOVE the fact that this workout focus on toning your body and being able to keep up with it.
*I would recommend this to beginners and to people who don't really like the extreme workout, but will be able to get the result that you want as long as you keep doing the video.",1371340800,,387,3.9743589743589745
2461234,4,B000CEXF8S,"This DVD is so much fun. I usually skip the warm ups and do my own because they're ridiculous, but the instructor and girls are so kitchy it makes the whole thing so entertaining. Effective too! I always feel sore the next day.",1371081600,,227,4.3023255813953485
2461235,5,B000CEXF8S,"The Crunch series of workout videos are terrific (I have a few).  I like this workout for several reasons.  First of all it consists of 20 minutes each for upper and lower body workouts.  I usually do both, but if you desire you could split them into two days.  Secondly, Kendall Hogan has a great attitude and makes the workout fun.  Thirdly; you will see (and feel) the effects of this workout right away, which encourages you to do this regularly.  Finally, working out with weights builds strength.
I am 56 years old (and a former woman Marine), so don't think you are too old or out of shape to do this workout.  Just do it and reap the benefits.  Best Wishes.",1370044800,,665,4.39344262295082
2461236,5,B000CEXF8S,"I searched and searched to find Kendall Hogan workouts, I used to watch him on Discovery Health and fell in love with his workouts.  When I found the Crunch series, I was in heaven.  Kendall gives a pretty good warm up and cool down, his cueing is spot on and his personality is great.  There are no complicated moves, he is pretty straight forward but the workout was a good one and I worked up a sweat and according to my HRM burned a decent amount of calories for a strength workout.  It's not a long workout out at around 45 minutes but a good one.

I've bought most of the Crunch workouts, except the dance ones  I don't dance, and you can't go wrong with this series.",1367971200,,673,4.21875
2461237,5,B000CEXF8S,I bought this DVD because I missed it so much after Netflix got rid of it. You get a great work out for your thighs perfect for summer! Bought this used and it came shrink wrapped and in perfect condition. No issues at all.,1366675200,,223,4.090909090909091
2461238,5,B000CEXF8S,"This video is great if you want an intense workout in a short amount of time. It keeps you busy with choreographed moves, but also provides a good challenge utilizing the weights for upper and lower body. I would definitely recommend this video!",1366329600,,245,4.72093023255814
2461239,5,B000CEXF8S,"I love Kendall Hogan and his style of training!  If you do too, you won't be disappointed in this workout video.  I love that it has UB and LB and you can choose either or both if you have more time.  Great workout, especially when I don't have a full hour.  Thanks Kendall!!!",1365638400,,276,4.150943396226415
2461240,5,B000CEXF8S,I love this video and I keep going back to it--I do add more weight as I get stronger. I have used it so much that I have bought it 2x. I wish they would release another set of Crunch videos. These are awesome. I love the instructor he is fun and motivating.,1360281600,,258,3.8867924528301887
2461241,5,B000CEXF8S,"I absolutely love this workout!  I only have to do a little modification on a couple of moves.  In fact, I did it yesterday using 5lb. weights then followed it up with the Crunch: Ab Attack standing ab work to make a really good workout.  I lik how the instructor starts out easy and adds on to the moves gradually.  I hope to find more workouts by him as he is a very good trainer.",1360022400,,382,4.053333333333334
2461242,5,B000CEXF8S,"Kendell is a great motivator as an instructor (in a 'you rock girlfriend!' kind of way). Fun but not too syrupy/fluffy. I have since used some of the P90x videos. I would actually say this video is thorough in the same way...several different exercises working the same group of muscles in different ways with high reps (but moves along at a much quicker pace than Tony Horton and all of his gab). It doesn't work the muscles quite as hard (particularly legs) as P90x but very well rounded.  I usually switch back and forth between 3's & 5's for the arms (note that I play volleyball, tennis & racketball and a regular basis and my shoulders/arms already get a fairly decent workout).  I sometimes add one section as a follow-up to cardio or I just do both in one day with no other workout.",1357430400,,790,4.479166666666667
2461243,3,B000CEXF8S,"I bought this because the price was right and other reviewers seemed to think this one is excellent. I won't say it is the best exercise video, but it is okay.  The instructor is very good but there are things that bother me- for example, one of the exercisers who is following him is an instructor in other videos that I do not like, so seeing her annoys me.  I have only watched it once- I'll do it again this weekend and see if I can up the stars to 4.

I have watched this dvd a couple more times and I think it deserves 4 stars.  The instructor is very motivating.",1357344000,,569,4.053571428571429
2461244,3,B000CEXF8S,I thought this DVD was good but some what boring. It is an intermediate workout and I was sore the next day. I did it once becasue it used to be on Netflix instant but I would not buy it.,1357084800,,187,3.7
2461245,4,B000CEXF8S,"Kendall is one of the most engaging instructors out there. He is very personable and encouraging. This DVD is great for a day where you want to work your major muscle groups (no abs) but do not want to push yourself too hard.

You will not break the bank with this one, but you will love to have it in your collection.",1355443200,,318,4.129032258064516
2461246,5,B000CEXF8S,"This is one of my favorite Crunch exercise routines. It's in my regular rotation. You can make it a little easier or a little harder, depending on the size of the weights you use.",1355270400,,179,4.294117647058823
2461247,5,B000CEXF8S,This exercise program is great. It works all your major muscles. I did this for three months this summer along with eating sensibly and lost 18 pounds. It is well worth the money.,1348790400,,179,4.454545454545454
2461248,5,B000CEXF8S,This DVD allows me to work upper or lower body very effectively.  Love the strength training and the different exercises to get those hard to reach muscles.  20 minutes per workout.  Fantastic!,1348444800,,193,4.96875
2461249,5,B000CEXF8S,"I am 57 years old and tho I have been exercizing regularly for 25 years, let's face it, I don't love it and I'm getting old.  But this DVD is a great toning workout that always leaves me feeling the effects the next day.  You can do just the upper body or just the lower body, or the whole thing---whatever you feel up to.  There is a lot of variation in this program so you never get bored with it.  And let me say, I think I have every one of Kendall Hogan's workout videos--he is such a fantastic motivator and a charismatic personality that will want you to keep coming back to workout with him and his crew!  Anybody who can keep me coming back for more excercize is a GENIUS in my mind!",1347667200,,692,4.0962962962962965
2461289,5,B000CEXF8S,"I really appreciate this short toning workout. It is non-intimidating, has a fun and positive vibe, and is most importantly, do-able. While it won't give you the body of the in-shape girls on the video it is great for building strength -  especially for a beginner or one who has neglected toning. You will definitely feel your legs and buns the next day if you haven't worked them for a while!
Also, enough good things can't be said about Kendell...he is simply the best. His upbeat, enouraging personality is a great motivator and, um, I wouldn't exactly throw kibble at him. ;)

When I get lazy and stop working out (which I tend to do if I get bored) this is a dvd I turn to to break-in and re-strengthen my legs, preparing them for harder workouts. Because of the length and low reps, this dvd helps take some of the suck factor out of lunges.
Another reviewer mentioned that there are crunches in this dvd but there are none - I think she meant lunges. There is upper body and lower body toning but no ab work (except for the usual ""hold your abs tight"").

I really like this one.",1346198400,,1086,4.393034825870647

I've been exercising for years and started having problems with back and feet trying to keep up with the 20-somethings in kickboxing and bootcamp classes!  I gave up the gym membership when I discovered these FANTASTIC workout videos on Netflix.  Netflix has since dropped them from instant streaming, and I plan on purchasing a BUNCH of them!

I enjoy this video, even though I'm not thrilled about working out with weights.  I usually prefer cardio and dance-related videos, as I think they pass the time so quickly.  But this is a great video to work out with your hand weights, and it's split up between upper body and lower body so you can stagger your workouts.

The instructor is very likeable too.",1345507200,,771,4.7443609022556394

Don't worry ladies, you won't get bulky muscles, just a nice and sexy toned body. The lower body is awesome if you like crunches. I have a bad knee so I don't do the crunch thing. I have plenty of other low body toning videos to work with. Kendall is very pleasant and makes the workout fun and he ain't hard on the eyes either. Great for Intermediate Level Exercisers!",1335484800,,468,4.211111111111111
2461292,5,B000CEXF8S,"I accidentally stumbled into Kendell's workouts on Fit tv and became instantly hooked.
Kendell has such an uplifting spirit is so motivating that you might forget that you are
doing a workout. Don't be fooled however, this is a highly effective workout with lots
of new/interesting, targeted moves.  The music is uplifting and his cueing is perfect.
His calm yet upbeat and encouraging voice will encourage/motivate you to push yourself
a little further.  The ""feel-good"" effects of his workouts lasts for hours afterwards.

I have been working out with Leslie Sansone and The-Firm videos for a number of years and
really and wanted try something a little diffent and add some variety and Kendall is
certainly a welcomed addition to my video collection.

Usually, home workouts aren't that great. This DVD had me sweating and very sore after completing it. Keep in mind, this is not a cardio DVD, but you still break a sweat. The upper-body workout was great. The lower-body workout would be better if it included an ab routine. However, you still get a great workout! I workout 5-6 days a week and really enjoyed this one. You won't be disappointed.",1324339200,,533,4.5625

Very easy to follow and the results are fabulous. I have been doing this video for over a year on a weekly basis (I've increased the weights since I've started) and am still loving it!

I have found that the Crunch series is one of the best, with really good instructors, fun, easy to follow moves, and motivating but not irritating or distracting music.  I definitely recommend this one.",1302048000,,281,4.833333333333333

Cons: Only one I can think of is no dedicated ab work although he does emphasize to keep your abs tight.

About me: Beginning exerciser. I don't enjoy working out and get flubbed up easily by videos with choreography. This was good and easy. It made me feel proud to have finished it and each time, I get better and better. The instructor is actually really good. His personality is just right and gives good queues. I actually look forward to doing this one.

I was surprised this happened because it is not a difficult workout. I recommend 5-8 lbs weights. The instructor is very pleasant and inspiring and has a very nice voice. The only problem some may face is during the alternating backward lunges, it can be hard on the knees. Other than that, the workout if fine and promotes ""hourglass figure"" sculpting.",1284076800,2,499,4.747126436781609

I'm a male in my early sixties and these fun routines are enough to keep me loose & flexible, increase my heart rate, and keep my muscles toned.

Reviewed a number of exercise DVD's from my local library and found ""Crunch"" to be the one that most fit my lifestyle.

My price for this DVD with S&H was under $11.00 - a great value.

2461323,4,B000CEXF8S,"I was introduced to Kendall Hogan via Fit Tv. I love all of his All-Star Workout episodes they play, I believe there are 3 total. This DVD is the same enthusiastic Kendall Hogan that I loved from FitTV, but it lacked some of the cardio that I like in his other workouts I've done. When I do this workout I usually hit the treadmill for 15-20 first to get in the cardio that I want. With that said my husband really liked it b/c of the ease of the short cardio circuits he does and the great upper body workout. I agree that the toning when done with appropriate weights for your ability you can really feel the workout. They suggest one set of weights, but I use 2 sets (3's and 5's...a few moves I even use 10's- but my goal is always more reps than weight). From a male perspective my husband uses 15- 30lb weights and really likes the 45mins+ workout.

Overall, I think you'll enjoy this workout if you are looking for a toning routine.",1257724800,2,939,4.245810055865922
2461324,4,B000CEXF8S,"This DVD is great! Kendell takes things at a managable pace. I am not at all coordinated but am able to follow along without a problem. My muscles expecially glutes and arms are sore the day after. I haven't lost much weight, but can see a definite difference in tone. I can actually see where my muscles are!! I've only been using the DVD for about three weeks, but so far I love it. Wish there was a little more focus on abs, but I can always work them on my own. Kendell is modivational and really keeps you going even when you want to stop.",1256515200,,544,4.1415094339622645
2461325,5,B000CEXF8S,"I workout 6 days a week to a large collection of fitness dvds that I've amassed over the last few years. Because of this, I have a lot to compare this dvd to...and I'd give this one 6 stars if I could.

Strength: First, it's rare to find a dvd that hits the mark on so many levels. As far as strength training goes it's among the best. He really gives you just the right amount of reps to really make a difference. In all honesty, many strength workouts do too few. This will build muscle and tone which means you continue burning calories long after the workout (studies have shown this about strength training) and increase metabolism so you continue to burn calories even at rest as you build more muscle.

Caloric burn: That said, most strength workouts will offer the above benefits but not high caloric burn during the workout like a cardio workout would. (cardio typically burns way more calories DURING the workout) Not so for this one. I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn and, becauase of this, I'm also able to measure exactly how many calories I burn total and per minute during a fitness dvd. I mention this only so you know what I say is based on scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion. Surprisingly, this packed as much punch as many of my cardio workouts as far as calaoric burn, without feeling like you are out of breath at all!  he achieves this by a fun small cardio warm up to get your heart pumping and then utilizing moves that work both upper and lower body to keep it up during a great deal of the dvd. He begins with an amazing lower body workout and utilizing these large muscles in the body are great for higher caloric burn via muacle development. It's well thought out and, consequently, I actually burned MORE calories during this STRENGTH workout than some other CARDIO calorie burning workouts. Because strength offers additional caloric benefits this makes it a big winner in my book and a rarity.

Cueing: I have two left feet so I give away many dvds that trip me up due to poor cueing. This one is a keeper. I've never seen this instructor before (but I'd buy him again...more on that in a minute) but he's got the cueing down...not only does he let you know what you are going to do clearly before you do it, but even in the cardio portion he repeats steps until you have it down and they are all easy to follow but fun in a new and different kind of way. Not the usual moves you see time after time and you'll work your abs even in the standing movements. Great cueing and if I can do it anybody can.

Energy: excellent. The instructor has a low radio announcer kind of voice just a notch above the Allstate commercial guy tone so it's smooth and easy to hear, yet he is all about energy. Many instructors seem fake when they try to act like they are enjoying their workout ( I think of some of the Firm instructors who look bored but say things like ""that was fun!"" or ""that felt great!"" in a bored voice) but he truly looked and sounded as though he was having a blast and that was contagious. I often pause a dvd in the middle when I'm working out and hop on my elliptical for a few minutes or just do some jumping jacks or dance to mix things up, then go back to the dvd when it doesn't keep my attention span. This was the first dvd in a long long time that I DIDNT want to end. That shocked me. I MAKE myself workout...I don't look foreward to doing it often.

Set: Very cool and brightly colored and well lit gym with glass windows...quite cool looking for a gym look.

Body toning: full body, every muscle. You will FEEL this one...if you don't increase your weights. Even standing core and ab work is included...you'll feel it even without monotonous lengthy floor crunches.

Backup trainers: all followed along perfectly with no irritating ""woooops!"" and ""yeahs!"" or anything like that that you often see. Good energy here too.

Equipment: just grab some weights.

Negative: I try to end every review with a negeative since rarely is anything pefect...but I think this one is about as close as you can get. I guess if I had to pick something it may be that I know some people like to have ""real"" looking people in a fitness dvd along with the hard bodies so they feel like ""they are doing this so so can I"" and you won't see that here. They do all look like models or um, ""dancers"" but to me that's a bit inspiring...so it will bug some but I'm okay with it...It makes me think I need to keep going because I'm 43 and well, not in that kind of shape! It makes me want to be. (Ah, one can dream...) However, for those who may find this a negative I guess it's the only thing I can really mention. Which says a lot about the dvd.

Conclusion: A 6 star dvd in my opinion. Burns the calories, tones the muscles, with an instructor that motivated me better than others have in a long time. The energy is contagious and the moves are easy to follow. And boy will you feel it working!!!

p.s. His lower body workout offers a great fanny lifter! Yowza!",1254700800,18,5022,4.342217484008529
2461326,5,B000CEXF8S,"I tried this workout DVD from Netflix, and I'm online now to buy it!  Kendall Hogan is a great, direct, easy-to-follow instructor.  After the warm up, you do about 20 minutes of lower body, including plie squats, then anther warm up before beginning upper body.  I think the upper body section is actually tougher.  Lots of back (ex: rows) and shoulders.  I love one of the last shoulder exercises, which is a combination that hits the front, side, and back of the shoulder.  Kendall finishes on the floor with push-ups and chest, then the cool down and stretch.

It's a fairly short (45 minute) workout with a strong emphasis on the back and shoulders, which I love.  The workout moves quickly because it's challenging but fun.",1254268800,,728,4.722222222222222
2461327,5,B000CEXF8S,"I have several of Kendell Hogans workouts and I enjoy every one of them.  I can even get my husband to do Kendell's workouts.  Kendell is fun, the routines are easy to follow, his crew is good, and the music adds to the workout.  You might also check him out on All Star Workout on FitTv.",1237680000,,288,4.107142857142857
2461328,4,B000CEXF8S,I like this workout because it is chaptered by arms/legs.  The instructor is very upbeat.  He has a unique energetic style that I like.  Watch a preview to see if the style suits you before buying.,1235433600,,197,4.416666666666667
2461329,4,B000CEXF8S,"I exercise at home on a regular basis.  Adding dvds to my program has been a great decision.  Although I already did weight training at least three times a week for several years, this dvd offered a more challenging workout to my routine.  Breaking this workout into two segments works well.  Beginners are offered the opportunity to do one segment one day, the other one on another day. For more advanced people, doing both segments gives a pretty decent workout.  This program along with an additional abs workout is a good way to start your day.",1234483200,,548,4.666666666666667
2461330,5,B000CEXF8S,"I love this workout! Kendell is spirited and makes the workout fun.  He prompts well. The weight lifting exercise routine is a good combination of upper and lower body workouts.  He targets the muscle groups effectively. If you are looking for a fast past weight lifting routine that will make you sweat, this is it.",1213920000,2,316,4.7272727272727275
2461331,5,B000CEXF8S,"Kendall Hogan is a great instructor but he is especially good for anyone starting to exercise or strength train. He keeps his moves easy and basic. Although he is motivating, he is not over the top (like Denise Austin, for example). The moves are challenging enough to keep you interested but not so involved that you get frustrated and give up. I know that I can commit to do these workouts regularly. The upper body and lower body workouts are just 20 minutes each. But, you will work! I recommend this DVD for anyone who is trying to look firmer.",1212883200,2,549,4.5
2461332,5,B000CEXF8S,This is so great for upper & lower body toning. The instructor is very motivating and fun! It's mostly weights... which is nice!,1208908800,2,128,4.608695652173913
2461333,5,B000CEXF8S,"This is by far one of the most fun DVD's I own from Crunch Fitness. I don't get fatigued when I workout the entire 40 minutes (20 minutes lower and 20 minutes upper.) The instructor is fun to follow and the workout seems to just fly by! I do this DVD 3x a week and I can definitely tell a different in my arms especially!
Again, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD and would recommend it to anyone!",1203033600,2,388,3.9871794871794872
2461334,5,B000CEXF8S,"This is a great DVD for those of us that know we should be lifting weights....but hate doing it.

I was first introduced to Kendell on Fit TV.  His optimistic demeanor is addicting- he's energetic without being annoying.  He pushes enough to where I find my brain screaming, ""NO MORE!"" yet my body still squeezes out one more rep.  The moves are as difficult as you want them to be- simply add more weight if you aren't feeling challenged enough.  The moves are pretty straightforward, but he does throw in a few twists on the basics.  It's enough to keep things interesting without being impossible.

The DVD is very easy to follow and is great for those who are looking to get a good weight routine in without spending hours in the gym.  Is it going to give the same results as slaving away in the gym?  Most likely not.  But it's great for someone who is time crunched or just looking into getting into more weight training.  Or for someone who just wants something they can do at home to help sculpt some muscle.",1197331200,,1016,4.437837837837838
2461335,5,B000CEXF8S,"This is an awesome workout.  Kendell Hogan is, as always, fabulous.  The DVD is chaptered into upper and lower body segments. Unfortunately, there is no ab work on this DVD.  It's a challenging workout but not a killer workout.  The Lower Body section is about a 6 minute warmup followed by about 15 minutes of squats, lunges, and leg extensions.  More advanced exercisers may be tempted to heavy up on the weight to make the workout more challenging but, the exercises are not done simply with your arms at your side.  Your upper body and balance are challenged because on some of the lower body exercises, the arms are held straight out in front of you or to the side with the weights in hand.  So, upping the weight can be a little difficult.

The upper body segment also has a warm-up which I fast forwarded through.  This workout is apparently designed so that upper and lower are done on separate days.  I do it all in one day.  Again, it is about 15 minutes of challenging upper body work filled with compound moves.  There seemed to be a disproportionate amount of shoulder work to me but still an overall good workout for the upper body.  The only complaint I have with this workout is that there are not enough reps.  Just when I was starting to get a good burn, it was time to move on to the next exercise.  Kendell's cueing is awesome and he has a warm, encouraging manner that makes the time just fly by.  He is truly one of the best fitness instructors out there!",1190073600,4,1477,4.4148148148148145
2461336,5,B000CEXF8S,"I really enjoyed this workout video. I searched for a video by Kendall Hogan after I started doing his workouts on Comcast OnDemand. He is a good instructor who gives a lot of cues and positive reinforcement. It is a moderate to strenuous workout (depending on your physiacl abilities). I was certainly sore for a day or two afterwards, but I have some great definition and tone to show for it!",1178496000,4,394,4.563380281690141
2461337,4,B000CEXF8S,"This is an awesome video. The instructor is awesome and it features some other Crunch instructors such as Jennifer, Kat, and Page. I find that I use 3lbs-8lbs throughout the video because there are something the 8lbs kill me to do and other things I get nothing out of 3 or 5lbs. I also tend to fast forward through the stretching. I am usually warmed up by the time I turn it on and he takes a long time to get started (hence only 4 stars). But once he does he keeps up the intensity and you will see results.",1171584000,,510,4.11
2461338,5,B000CEXF8S,"This workout is challenging enough for me to want to work harder each time, but still attainable and not impossible.  I alternate with different weights depending on what exercise we're doing because I'm weaker at some of the moves than others.  The instructor is encouraging and not annoying.  I also try to do an ab workout afterwards with another DVD since this workout doesn't include one.  Overall, a pretty challenging workout and great that you can split it up into 20 minutes workouts on busy days.",1163721600,4,506,4.848837209302325
2461339,4,B000CEXF8S,"I thought this was a great intermediate workout.  Kendall is energetic and cues well.  Both sections have a short warm-up and very short cool down.  The lower body section is all standing exercises.  You'll hold dumbells while you do lunges, squats and leg lifts. Kendall makes it interesting by changing the tempo and doing different variations so it's not just boring squats and lunges.  The upper body section starts with standing exercises for the back, shoulders and arms.  Then you'll do a few push ups and hit the floor for chest flies.  Even though it's only 20 min., Kendall covers all areas well.  You move back and forth between muscle groups to keep it interesting.  Kendall moves fast enough to keep you from getting bored; but doesn't move too fast.  You can change weights if you need to.  I felt challenged using 5 and 8lb. weights.  Advanced exercisers could use this for light days.",1155600000,6,900,4.7727272727272725
2461340,4,B000CEXF8S,"Being a former aerobics instructor and fitness trainer not to mention video production person, I'm a tough sell on dvd's... I have to day this one is very good on all levels.

For a good, compact and effective sculpting workout, all the bases are covered efficiently for both the upper and lower body workout.  The dvd is divided into separate sections so that the workout can be broken down into two parts.  Both are clear and concise, easy to follow, fun and a decent workout for beginners and intermediates.  For advanced exercisers, it offers a nice ""easy-day""  workout for a day you just can't make it to the gym.
