8393024,5,B003AND1TQ,Great horror / tragic anime show with each short story having a moral ending that makes you think twice about committing revenge on some one.,1301443200,2,141,4.68
8393025,1,B003AND1TQ,"After finished watching the first season, I thought the second season would be just as entertaining, but I was sadly mistaken.  Overall the 2nd season gave me more frustrations than enjoyments.

ok, here are my problems:  **CONTAIN SPOILERS**

1) Boring -- The second season basically copies the exact same formula from the first season; however, the only differences are the first season manages to have some plot developments in the midst of the story, which leads us to know what is Hell Girl and why is she doing this, plus her background and the history of Hell Correspondence etc. Whereas, the second season continues with its episodic structure, which is just leading nowhere until the very last few episodes. All in all, this season has no forward momentum, meaning that nothing that takes place really matters, because everything will just be exactly the same after as it was before.

2) Meddling Fools - I find it very annoying that Ai's servants keep meddling with their ""clients' affairs in almost every episode.  In first season, they basically play as an spectator and don't intervene until the red thread has been pulled by the client (well most of the time).  This way makes much more sense.  However, in the second season, they play a huge part in pushing the clients to get revenge and at some points helping clients to identify whom they should put curses on as if they were heroes who actually are offering something in their best interest.  One question I often want to ask while watching it: why would they even need to investigate clients' situations and affairs while their jobs are basically to send whomever their clients put curses on (whether they are good or bad) to hell? This never explains which lead one to think their actions are completely off-the-mark and pointless.

3) The absence of Hajime - one of the biggest assets in the first season is the character Hajime, a reporter who investigates Hell Girl and persistently tries to stop her from sending people to hell.  Having character like Hajime has brought an interesting moral debate whether Hell Girl's actions are just or evil.  Through Hajime and her daughter's quest, the plot has got more twists and expectations, for example can they stop hell girl; how much will they lead us to the truth about hell girl and how is Hell girl and her servants going to deal with hajime who is mucking up their business etc.  In the 2nd season, unfortunately he and his daughter are absent, which makes the show as boring as watching a paint dry.  No one is trying to stop Hell Girl in this season; no one will be playing a morally reasonable role to talk some sense to the people who think the only way to deal with their problems are to send their obstacles to hell.  Huge disappointment!

4) Frustrated characters - the show's lifeblood. And I have awful lot to say about this one.  All characters who ask for Hell Girl's assistance are absolutely a wimp; they are like the weakest link in human society, the most pathetic individual ever graced the earth.  Every time they have a problem, instead of confronting (not physically) the person who made their lives miserable or seek helps from parties who can help them with the matters (teachers, police, social workers, parents etc), they think the only way to deal with their problems are to send the people to hell without using up all of the available options.

For example, a woman keeps getting harassed in her new apartment from her neighbor who couldn't bear the fact that she ""took her cat away"" from her (actually the woman just looks after the cat, she didn't even know the cat belongs to her neighbor).  So did she contact her superintendant or police to file a complaint against her neighbor or talk to her neighbor face-to-face when she got home? No. Instead of solving the problem like a normal human would, she takes all the harassments and keeps feeling sorry for herself until being pushed to the limit where she believes the only solution is to send her neighbor to hell.  Another example, a boy saw her mother killed by a dagger following the killer's trail and found the weapon lying on the ground. He picks it up without knowing the significance, at this time, he was seen by a neighbor who then leads to the whole town suspecting the boy was the one who killed her own mother.  At the funeral, while everybody was gossiping about the murder, neither the boy nor his father ever stood up for themselves to clarify for the incident as if it never crossed their mind that they should do something to make the false accusation to go away.  One last example, a young woman holds grudge against her older brother because she couldn't stand her brother constantly disguises as a beautiful woman in an attempt to steal her boyfriends; she then summons Hell Girl and obtains the doll; but once she found out the truth her brother was actually fallen in love with her, which prompted him to commit such a dysfunctional behavior.  Feeling upset and shocked, instead of cutting him out of her life or moving out of the apartment or sending her brother to see a psychiatrist, she sent her regretful brother straight to hell.  All these stuff are so unrealistic and ridiculous. Many problems depict in the season, in the real world, would be dealt with easily and peacefully, and instead goes completely off the handle because apparently all these characters are so weak-minded that they can't deal with the problems.  For some absurd reasons, the characters with troubles have always been put in a situation where no other parties can involve to help such as police, teachers, parents etc. except the Hell Girl.

The season is filled with ridiculous stuff like this, which makes me wonder if the writer has ever actually associated with another human being in society.  Although I understand this is an animated series, that doesn't excuse the characters have to behave in such a strange way.  I also realize cultural differences may be playing a part in this, but can you really say this stuff is normal in any culture? I doubt it.

All in all, don't waste your time and money on this season and the one after.  If you love Hell Girl, keep watching the first season, which has more depth than this repetitive, frustrating piece of trash.  Now I finally understand why FUNimation didn't pick up this season.  It's not always about sales or revenue, in this case, the lack of quality is to blame.",1295827200,4,6435,4.711864406779661
8393026,5,B003AND1TQ,"After seeing the result of the first Hell girl, I was wondering what the second season might lead into. what I found was an exploration of some of the people surrounding our Hell girl, some explanations here and there that tie certain events together, and a threat that says that ""your loved ones will wander and never know peace"" if the covenent was not continued. So, along with a young girl that is explained as things progress, more people with more problems sign on to send people off to Hell - and sometimes without hardcore reasons. Strange, how much vengence can build up in a person.

First, I think I want to address the dubbing notion. i like the subtitled version myself, and I think it hlps out a lot. There are scenes where two people may be talking and you get a second set of subs on the screen, but aside from weird things like that you have a lot of clarity. Moreover, the subtitles are done really well and actually seem to translate better than some of the dubbing from last season.

Second, there is a theme that sticks with a specific place and that sees the Hell Girl and Crew blending in with the locals. This makes them many things, including curious and sometimes even angry. In the last season you were following a mysery but, in this season, you see more of the personalities coming out. i personally don't like the way the newest bundle of - something - plays out, but the rest of the group is interesting to see as they are moved by some things, perplexed by others, and act as though they really believe in the deed they are doing - despite the whole ""curses come home to roost"" thing.

Third, I simply enjoy Hell girl a lot this time. She isn't picky by any real means and some of the cases she takes on really must be fueled by rage because they really aren't the worst slights. That said, she is offering revenge for a place in Hell. Her character is developed somewhat here as this goes on, and we see the things she cares about and is moved by. She also has a new line and, in the end, she says"" care to give death a try"" in one of the most beautiful ways I've heard. Dubbing would kill this and, well, you should just try her on without English to see what I mean.

All that said, the seriousness is not always there but the torment has been added to. In the 1st season, a boatride was just a crossing but this time it can be a tormenting affair. also, there is one person that meets their end after getting revenge, so we see a little of the Hell part of the deal.
Personally, I love this seres and say watch it from the start to understand, then watch this season to get more. You will like it - or else someone might type your name into a certain website around midnight.",1280620800,11,2711,4.278752436647173
8393027,5,B003AND1TQ,"I was a big fan of the first season of Hell Girl so when I heard they weren't ever going to dub season 2 I wondered if I would still enjoy the subtitled release. The answer is a big yes!!  It really wasn't a problem with the subtitles and several characters such as Hone Onma seem more enjoyable in their original Japanese voices.  Even though I don't understand Japanese hearing her reactions and tone for voice was great-the English voice actress in season 1 defintiely wasn't as expressive.
The addition of the mysterious Kikuri really kept the show fresh and interesting.  In these 13 episodes you really get to know Ai Enma's servants a lot better and that makes the story more enjoyable.
If you enjoyed the first season this is definitely worth your time!!",1277856000,8,762,4.62962962962963
