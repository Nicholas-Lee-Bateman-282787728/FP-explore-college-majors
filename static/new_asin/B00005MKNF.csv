7945629,2,B00005MKNF,"I absolutely loved the Captain Tylor TV series, and I couldn't wait to see the OVAs.  Unfortunately, I was badly disappointed.  There is a plot, but half of the series is taken up by side stories about various characters that do nothing to further the main action.  Moreover, Captian Tylor just wasn't the same hilarious, happy-go-lucky guy I had come to know and love.  Though he hides it well...to me, it almost seemed like the Irresponsible Captian had become...responsible.
Go ahead and watch the OVAs, if you want.  They're not horrible.  Just don't expect them to be like the TV series.",1077494400,5,592,4.811881188118812
7945630,5,B00005MKNF,"I watched this a little worried. I had heard that the OVA collection was not as good as the original series. I am writing this to say that what I heard was totally WRONG!!!!
This series is just as good, its different but it's still Tylor at its finest.
The First DVD in the 3 DVD set is the same style and humor of the original series, it almost feels like ""the lost episodes."" After the first DVD the other two DVDs change to a different style of animation and the series changes a little but not for the worse.
The one problem that I kept hearing was that there was a more serious tone in this series. This is true for 4 of the side story episodes, but its serious for the very reason that Tylor is not really in them. He makes small cameos but other then that the stories focus on other members of the Soyokaze while they are on ground time.  Without Tylor the other characters WOULD act this way. I appreciate the fact that I got to see them in action without Tylor because it made me appreciate them a little more, as well as the humor and liveliness Tylor brought to their lives and to the story.
I do not want to spoil anything detailing the story or the series so let me just say that this series is a wonderful series to watch, its a little shorter then the original but its still worth your time.",1053043200,8,1306,4.16205533596838
7945631,5,B00005MKNF,I think that this series is as good as the original box set. It is a little more complex plot structure but still presents the most attractive aspects of the original series. I cannot recommend this enough. A real winner.,1011657600,3,221,4.55
7945632,4,B00005MKNF,"WARNING:  This is not the Tylor that you're used to.  A lot of people in my anime club were lost by the OAV series.  It's focused heavily on the peripheral characters, the story does NOT go the direction that most of the TV series fans had hoped it would, and it is 100% serious.  The clever/silly humor from the TV series was dropped for a serious story line in the OAV.
Now that you have this warning, you're ready to approach these DVD's.  It's been a few years since I've seen the fan-subs of the Tylor OAVs, but the DVD quality will be far better than the 10th generation tapes that I have.  As I said above, the story is told in a different style from the TV series, but that doesn't mean that it's bad.  Taken on their own, I really enjoy them.  The story is good, and as always, the animation is improved from the TV series.  I just thought I should write this brief warning because, as I said, many fans of the TV series were very disappointed when the characters' motives and actions changed in the OVA.",993686400,22,1013,4.261780104712042
