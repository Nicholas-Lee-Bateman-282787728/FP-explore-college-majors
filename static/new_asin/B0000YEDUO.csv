1958713,3,B0000YEDUO,"When you see a message at the beginning of your DVD that says ""We have done our best to preserve the quality... blah blah blah"" then you know you've just been had. Yep! The quality of the movies on these DVDs - both pan/scan are poor quality. The Gappa film is very dark and ""muddy"". It looks like a very old 16MM dub.

I bought this because I wanted a copy of ""G Vs. Jiger"" on DVD. It was cheap so I am not complaining more than I already have.

As Gamera films go, I really liked ""Gamera Vs. Monster X"" (Jiger). The two main kid heroes are a little older in this one, so they were not so annoying. The fact that they are wearring scout outfits throughout is kind of strange and the little girl in the movie is just creepy. Watch it and I am sure you will agree. I don't know if it is the fact that an adult actress is doing the English child voice in the dub or if its just the fact that she looks like one of the flying monkeys from the ""Wizard Of Oz"". I am shuddering now just writing this passage about her - WEIRD!!!

Anyway, Jiger is a ridiculous costume. He is a quadruped like Barugon and Guiron with a stinging tail, suction cup skin, and rhino-like horns that shoot bone darts. He also has a bitchin' heat ray. Though the costume is a bit silly, the effects in this movie are not too shabby. There is some serious city devastation in this one. More than in most Gamera films. The Expo center set is not too remarkable, but it beats a wooded area with a few popsickle stick electric towers anyday.

The best part is the boys venturing into Gamera (Yeah - right. Their parents are going to let them do that!) to find out what is wrong with him. Great homage to ""Fantastic Voyage"". Inside they must battle a mini Jiger with no weapons. Now that's tension.

A hysterically silly kaiju film with an incredibly gory escape from death by Gamera, where he has to pull a bone dart through each of his limbs in order to fly again. Ahhhhh! That's gotta hurt!

Come to think of it... I could never understand how Gamera could fly with fire jetting out of his shell holes and never get burned. Hmmmm.

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Don't think. Just enjoy. This Gamera is a fun one. Get a copy.",1123891200,,2180,4.2009569377990434
1958714,1,B0000YEDUO,"What is this garbage you call a film? I can see the guy in the suite through an open cut on gamera! When he is attacked by the monster called Xianga, he bleeds for about 5 minutes top and it is stupid. I saw the camera man in the window of a minature building! In one scene, Gamera trips and farts! What the? Why would a monster fart? You tell me? And the actors are in the movie for about 10 minutes and the other whatever minutes is Gamera, explosions, warfare, and boredum. Why does Rodan make an Appearance! Why! And the ending has Gamera eating sea weed after a great battle! Sea Weed! What the? And another thing: Why does Gamera laugh when he killed Xianga and Karon the Garbage Monsters. Why are they called the Garbage monsters? Probably because the movie is garbage! And another point i must make clear: I saw the Japanese DVD directly from Tokyo, and they makers of Gamera said, ""Gamera is our god, and Godzilla is probably filth compared to our special effects.""  The makers are idiots and the story in lame terms is simply this: Scientist find out about Xianga, and Karon. Karon destroys tokyo. Xianga fights tanks. Gamera appears and kills Rodan. Gamera helps children from a burning school which Karon lits on fire. Gamera kills Karon, and Xianga is invinciable. Gamera nearly dies and the scene occurs where he farts. Xianga is killed by a missle called X- Xiangusm. Then gamera eats sea weed. The End. How boring and unorignal!",1103155200,4,1444,4.553846153846154
1958715,5,B0000YEDUO,"I just saw this film for the first time ever. I am 33 and I never cought
this one when I was a kid. And boy oh boy I just cant say enough good things about this. This is on a par with RETURN OF THE GIANT MONSTERS and WAR OF THE MONSTERS.  A decent and fairly realistic opponent for Gamera is featured and the plot is really clever.
Far better than the previous films, DESTROY ALL PLANETS and  ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS and the awful one's that followed,  GAMERA  VS. ZIGRA and GAMERA SUPER MONSTER.
I  WAS REALLY ENTERTAINED BY GAMERA VS. MONSTER X!!!!!
My only complaint about this disk is the awful muddy copy of MONSTER
FROM A PREHISTORIC PLANET. This same terrible print is also being offered by Alpha Video, Lazer and Brentwood. I like nostalgia, but I
never saw a print this bad on TV when I was growing up. Orion Home Video's VHS tape from about fifteen years ago was far superior. Other than that its a pretty good monster movie. It was originally called GAPPA- THE TRIPHIBIAN MONSTER or MONSTERS but American
International changed the title when the sold it to TV in a package with
VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET.",1101686400,7,1119,4.386473429951691
1958716,1,B0000YEDUO,"I don't expect the type of features I would see on a collector's edition of Citizen Kane when I am getting a dvd of a classic monster film, however some basic respect to the consumers' intelligence would be nice.
First, it would be nice if this were done in wide screen format, instead of the obvious pan and scan.  It is easy to detect from the title sequences which are cut off at the edges.  I am sure that the fight scenes in particular would be much more effective if we could see the entire picture the director intended.
Second, it would also have been nice if the transfer had been done in a professional manner.  The prints have obviously not been cleaned, and the transfer equipment not maintained.  At times I felt as if I was watching old home movies when I was a kid as flakes of debris traveled across the screen, occasionally staying around for a while, dancing on the screen.
As I said, I don't expect a digitally restored picture with a new soundtrack, but some basic standards would be nice.",1083369600,4,1009,4.437837837837838
1958717,4,B0000YEDUO,"Having very fond childhood memories of this movie, I have been waiting a long time for this film to arrive on VHS or DVD.  Retromedia has kindly provided the film on DVD, and I am most grateful.  (Now, I hope that Retromedia will release Gamera vs. Gyaos on DVD!)
1) Opinion of film:  Several things stand out:  a) a monster that reproduces via parasitic larvae--this movie was way ahead of its time--and shoots darts out of its head, which is really neat;  b) I liked the fact that Gamera was a friend to children, and the children had exciting and (sort of) plausible adventures to save his life--as a kid, I was fascinated by the children taking a sub into Gamera to find out why it was sick and then saving it from the parasite; and c) I was also greatly amused by Gamera sticking telephone poles in its ears to protect them against loud noise.
Although the film looks very different to these adult eyes, I still enjoyed watching it, and my children did, too.  The more recent Gamera films from the 1990s are far superior in most every way, but this film was a special treat for me as a child, and I'm glad to own the DVD of it.
2)  Opinion of DVD:  All of the DVD versions that I have seen of the old Gamera films look faded with poor color.  Although you can tell the print is old, this one isn't as bad as some.
This movie is pan-and-scan; I have never seen a completely widescreen version of this or any other old Gamera film, though the fight scenes suggest that they were filmed that way.  (Gamera vs. Barugon is a good example, and I can't help but remember seeing fight scenes of that in widescreen--none of the VHS or DVD versions of that film are widescreen, though, so I can't confirm that.)  Nevertheless, this version does mirror what I saw on TV as a child, so I won't complain.
Although I would prefer a restored print in widescreen format, if available, with all of the bells and whistles of a modern release, I accept that this is a cult film with a relatively small following; I'll take what I can get.  The price is a little high, but, because I've wanted to see this again for so long, I can't be too picky.
3)  Overall:  As old monster movies go, this is neither a classic nor a dud, so I should rate it 3 stars.  However, it is one of the better installments of the old Gamera series (Gamera vs. Barugon--aka ""War of the Monsters""--being the best and most dramatic, in my opinion, and Gamera vs. Zigra or Gamera vs. Guiron being among the worst), and it has been my sentimental favorite for years (definitely a children's film compared to Gamera vs. Barugon!).  Since it is one of the better ones from the old series, I'm giving it 4 stars.  Adult fans of the old series will mostly be grateful for this, and, if my children are any indication, kids who like monster movies will probably enjoy it.",1078272000,13,2823,4.356870229007634
1958718,5,B0000YEDUO,"The removal of a statue from an Island releases Jaiger(monsterX). jaiger heads straight for the statue, now on display at the Japan Expo, to destroy it. Gamera intercepts Jaiger before it can do a lot of damage.  Jaiger injects an egg into Gameras shoulder which grows into a parasite feeding on Gamera's blood from the inside turning Gamera white.  Gamera is paralized until two brave boys take a minisub into gamera's lungs and kill the parasite by using the radio waves emmited by their walky-talky. Gamera attacks Jaiger and kills it by thrusting the Statue into Jaigers head.",1075248000,,580,4.908163265306122
8004341,3,B0000YEDUO,"Theres a disclaimer at the beginning of Retromedias copy of Gamera Vs. Monster X that states essentially that the movie is old and the copy may not be in the best of conditions.  Yep.  They were certainly right.  There is all sorts of problems with this particular print, including it being washed out, severely cropped, and lots of fuzz and dust (a la stuck between the projector glass and film stock) mars the film.  I cant help but think that there are far better prints out there (perhaps the Blu-ray Gamera: Ultimate Collection Vol. 2?) but at the time that this was released this was the hardest to find Gamera film (for me at least it was).  Great childhood memories and a pretty great monster movie considering the time and restricted budget.  If you set the human characters aside for a moment you get great and creative monster action as Gamera battles Monster X (a.k.a. Jiger), a giant mutated salamander of sorts with a variety of bizarre and interesting powers that include its ability to shoot saliva spikes from horns coming forward from its enormous melon of a head.  The monster action breaks down essentially into three rounds:

Round 1: Gamera attempts to apprehend Jiger and quickly takes the upper hand flying the beast up into the air and unceremoniously dropping it repeatedly.  Gamera torches the groggy beast when it launches a surprise attack with aforementioned saliva spikes and it has got quite an aim!  It penetrates Gammies arms and legs and prevents the friend of all children from withdrawing back into its shell.  Jiger then knocks Gamera over onto his back but withdraws as Gamera continues to roast the odd quadrupedal beast and it takes to the sea.  Result: DRAW!
Round 2: Gamera parries the solid saliva attack during their second encounter but while he gets in some good licks ultimately he is veritably KOed when Jiger sticks Gamera in the neck with a tail spike.  Gamera is wounded and wobbles down to the water, drooping down into it, and slowly turns white as the life goes out of him.  Was he poisoned!?!  Result: the round goes to JIGER!
Round 3: In the final round Gamera, having been revived with the aid of some kids and their little submarine (more on that in a bit), is ready to put the kibosh on the cretaceous menace and uses his flying ability to lure Jiger with a gigantic talisman totem that emits an attracting noise for the creature.  As Jiger leaps after Gamera the flying terrapin maneuvers just out of reach until finally while Jiger is in mid-leap Gamera chucks the spiked totem which pierces Monster X squarely in the skull and kills him.  Result: FATALITY!  Winner: GAMERA!

The human characters drag the action down in a few exposition scenes but the older boys, a Japanese and an American boy, are integral to Gameras victory as when the helpful beast falls silent after round 2 the kids take a mini-submarine and drive it up into Gameras mouth and explore around inside the turtle.  This is, of course, shades of the sci-fi classic Fantastic Voyage.  As the boys traipse around Gameras innards they come across a baby Jiger which had been implanted into Gamera and is the cause of the turtles paralysis.  The babys suit is well-modeled after the adults and sports some smaller horns but looks great (as does Jigers suit).  It menaces the boys looking like one of the small almost ankylosaur-like cave monsters in either At the Earths Core or People That Time Forgot (I forget which but when a group of explorers tries to make their way through a short cave they are beset by many creatures literally coming out of the walls and one of the creatures is a menacing floor dweller that gives them trouble and, well, this scene reminds me of the baby Jiger scene in this Gamera movie).  The boys are in some danger but end up discovering what upsets and can actually kill the beast (radio waves of a certain frequency).  This whole sub-plot is well executed and makes this Gamera distinctly memorable from the rest of the series.

My main reason for having purchased this double feature was for the Gamera movie.  Monster From A Prehistoric Planet has been easily found paired up with many other features or sold on its own.  Its a pretty decent kaiju flick though not as well-known as the general Godzilla and Gamera movies.  In short its like a Japanese version of Gorgo.  Two giant flying monsters that look like chicken-headed monsters with a Godzilla-ish body and beetle-like wings, a male and a female, have a baby Gappa that is taken captive.  They wreak havoc when they go to get their baby back.

The films in this set would get a 4 star rating from me but Gameras shoddy copy gets it docked a star.  Id say pass this version up with other options in how to get GVSMonsterX these days.",1519430400,,4755,4.663069544364508

8004344,5,B0000YEDUO,Gamera vs. Monster X is a movie about Gamera fighting a monster known as Monster X aka. Giger. The two monsters battle and as usual Gamera defeats Monster X. Monster from a Prehistoric Planet is the story of a baby monster called the Gappa which is captured and brought to be displayed in public. It's parents arrive and are reunited with their baby. In between the adult Gappa's destroy buildings and set buildings on fire. The movie is also known as Gappa the Triphibian Monster. It is similar in style as Gorgo.,1238112000,,514,4.5978260869565215
8004345,5,B0000YEDUO,"Although the first three of the Showa series are the best (Gammera, the Invincible, War of the Monsters and Return of the Giant Monsters), this one is just as good as those three and much better then the following two Gamera films (Gamera vs. Zigra and Gamera Super Monster). Jiger (Or Monster X in the Dub) is possibly the first and only kaiju to ever impregnate another kaiju making her quite a lethal foe for our beloved turtle friend. The kids aren't that annoying but one thing that did bother me is that they would usually say ""Fight Gamera, fight!"" or ""Gamera, use your fire""! They treat Gamera as if he was a pokemon! No offense to fans of the games. Gamera does a few silly things as well. Like putting two poles in his ears so he could block off Jiger's beam thing (Hard to describe). Now for the second feature, Monster From a Prehistoric Planet (AKA Gappa, the Triphibian Monster). It's not bad but it's not great. A pretty fun kaiju flick if you ask me. The effects in MFAPP aren't too bad but are pretty fake looking. Why wasn't this on Mystery Science Theater 3000, I'll never know. Could have been a great episode. Anyways, now onto the DVD. The disc isn't that great in quality or extras. GVMX is in poor shape as colors are washed out and some scenes are just a bit too bright. The audio is good though so that's something to clap for. MFAPP is in very poor shape but better then the Alpha Video's disc of the film. Some scenes are so dark that it's hard to see what's going on. The only extra here is the Retro Media website info but it isn't much to satisfy our hunger for kaiju extras. One of the better Gamera films from the Showa series and a fun kaiju flick on a single disc that may disappoint some fans but at least you won't have much of a loss.",1214438400,,1772,4.2925373134328355
8004346,4,B0000YEDUO,"Great double-feature for a dull evening: two classic ""guys in rubber suits"" monster films featuring much destruction of toy cities, improbable plot twists, and hysterically bad dialogue. Fun for kids, and depending on the amount and quantity of intoxicants or whether you're just plain odd, for adults too.",1169078400,,306,5.395833333333333
8004347,3,B0000YEDUO,"Gamera flicks have rarely been known to be good movies, but Gamera vs. Jiger (or Monster X) isn't half bad...of course, it isn't half good, either, but it's entertaining enough for the kiddies, and has some rather creative elements, but, like all of the Showa Gamera R1 dvd's, the transfer is absolutely horrid, but the dubbing is only somewhat painful. Get it to complete your collection.

As for Gappa, aka ""Monster From a Prehistoric Planet,"" it's a nifty extra treat for kaiju fans...if you enjoy absolutely awful dubbing and rather sub-par SPFX. The Gappa monsters themmselves are basically combinations of Godzilla and Rodan, but they're still pretty creative (especially their roars).

Overall, a decent disc, considering that it's the best that we're going to get here in the US.",1140739200,3,787,5.093023255813954
8004348,2,B0000YEDUO,"The movie is slow and it takes a while before it gets going, but when it does, the movie is pretty good. It has a classic scene when Gamera puts electric poles in his ears to block out the high frequency noise. It's funny to watch him fight Jiger a.k.a. Monster X with electric poles sticking out of his ears! Overall pretty good, but definitely not the best out of the Showa series.",1133913600,,383,4.260273972602739

And was taken back to happier times {Ah to be young and oblivious} But I digress.  This Dvd has good audio quality and good video quality, on a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 9.  Only thing that sucks is after I sent for it I found it at the Dollar Tree dollar store, as a double feature with  War of the monsters.",1127001600,,474,3.727272727272727
