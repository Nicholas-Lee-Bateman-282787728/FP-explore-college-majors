4099959,3,B003A837Z4,"Nothing new here, more talk of how Uncle Sam is hiding the obvious from us.

Still I did enjoy the story's of a few people interviewed.  Listening to some old guy telling you he sat next to an alien during a meeting in 1967 that was wearing a white lab coat is something almost believable.

I was hoping for a little more video and interviews about these craft but it was mostly about the government hiding the facts.

If you can buy this DVD cheap then it's worth watching.",1282780800,7,474,4.292134831460674
4099960,3,B003A837Z4,"This one absolutely does not earn five stars.  Here's why:

Its attempts to portray itself as a serious documentary left me scratching my head.  While it includes interviews from well-known and respected UFO investigators, self-proclaimed abductees, and military personnel, the film is pieced together in a way that seems at best amateurish.

The reenactments are the high point of the filmmakers' additions to the documentary.  But it doesn't take an expert to notice the interviews seem to be spliced together in ways that make little sense; choppy cuts from one topic to another draw the audience's attention to the inconsistent sound levels in a way that's distracting (sometimes the film's soundtrack drowns out the narration, and sometimes it stops abruptly in the middle of an interview, etc).

If your film is loaded with explosive information to which you feel the public should have access, don't just count on the interviews to tell the story.  You have to organize the film in a coherent way, and your input, which should outline and organize the reasons you're creating the film, needs to be at least comprehensible to a wide range of audiences.  I could barely understand the female narrator as she obviously read from cue cards or a teleprompter between sections, if they could be so called.

I believe the information from the interviews was very interesting.  I'm always thrilled to hear new credible theories and information from the UFO community.  However, I do NOT think that the filmmakers did the best job they could to make a clear, organized documentary.  In the end, the production value detracts from our experience, and ultimately, the persuasive and fascinating information it presents.",1280966400,77,1715,5.129496402877698

What bothers me more than anything else is the assumptions present in seemingly all of these type of films, usually perpetuated by the same crackpot 'ufologists' each time.

One small example:  The military has a form specifically to report UFOs.  Ignoring the fact that the military has forms to fill out forms about forms, there is a need to uniformly report an object or aircraft that is by definition ""Unknown.""  The leap from reporting an aircraft configuration you're not familiar with to little green men is insulting even to pseudo-science.

4100030,2,B003A837Z4,"""Fastwalkers"" is a dragging and somewhat amateurish ""documentary"" about UFOs and aliens. The film mostly consists of interviews with the hard-core fringe of the ufology community: Steven Greer, Wendelle Stevens, New Age channel Dolores Cannon, supporters of George Adamski, conspiracy theorists, etc. Some of the ""evidence"" offered includes the saucer photos taken by Adamski! Billy Meier is referenced as a credible source.

The claims in ""Fastwalkers"" are frequently as extreme as they are absurd: there is an Interplanetary Federation, at least 57 different alien races interact with humanity, there are 30 dimensions, an alien once participated at a meeting of scientists in Los Alamos dressed in a suite... We also learn that the aliens have white skin and blue eyes which turn pink as they grow older. They don't have teeth, though, and seem to be vegetarian.

OK. I hope they serve veggie food in the cantina at Los Alamos.

All is not well on the alien front, however, since the Illuminati have made a deal with a dark side faction of the Federation to get access to their free energy technology. Or something - ""Fastwalkers"" are unclear on whether the aliens are hostile or friendly. Greer, ever the optimist, thinks the latter, and some other interviewees claim that alien abductions and even cattle mutilations are somehow positive. Alien shock therapy?

""Fastwalkers"" must be the most slow-paced and boring ""far out"" production I've ever seen. But sure, if you are obsessed by this subject, you might find it interesting. Or perhaps amusing...

I was impressed by many of the raw video clips/pictures but very unimpressed by the low budget animations and soundtrack.  The eye-witness accounts for the most part were believable and seemed credible.  The information presented was interesting enough that I could have done without music (which tends to rouse emotions).  I agree with the film that there is a cover-up in place from governments and that ET's have and are visiting our planet.

4100056,2,B003A837Z4,"Steven Greer is to be commended for producing some very interesting documentaries about UFO's.  This one starts out as being somewhat interesting because we see some great UFO videos for the first half hour.  I personally don't get tired of watching these.

But later on, we have some author comparing the UFO phenomenon with Genesis. Again.  We tiresomely hear, again, that UFO's have been sighted for thousands of years on earth, and again, the mindless Bible quotes that supposedly prove that our Biblical ancestors witnessed UFO's.  At this point it becomes
a sedative for me.  How disappointing this was.

There are a couple of very believable U.S. Navy pilots describing encounters with UFO's that tailed their jets.  There are several retired military bigshots who know about the UFO coverup.  This part is compelling.

Then we get the authors who want to sell their books, and they expound on a variety of crackpot theories mixed with religiosity without any type of
evidence either firsthand or otherwise and I am not only bored but disappointed.  Anyone who sets out to make a documentary on UFO's had better make it as credible and serious as possible and take pains to avoid unkempt,
hand waving hicks with far out theories.  Unfortunately, in an effort to fill up an hour and a half of time, every kook who has written about UFO's was shown here.

Steven Greer himself should have taken a few lessons on how to talk to the camera to sound serious and believable.  His inappropriate grins were disconcerting.  This is a subject which should get serious attention from scientists and the media.  Instead it is all too aften shown as something that seems to look foolish and hackneyed.

4100058,1,B003A837Z4,"I was amazed how many people actually rated this movie 4 or 5 stars. At best, 15 years a go this documentary would have been worth 3 stars.  But so much of the story and ""evidence"" of UFOs is centered around the Phoenix Arizona sighting (which we know now was Military Flares) it kinda debunks the whole show.  Add on top of that, the poor quality of the editing, and really questionable witnesses, its sort of funny when it shouldn't be.  Some of the witnesses remind me of drunk story tellers around a campfire!  Clearly embellishing the stories at will, and I mean stories in the fictional sense.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good UFO documentary when they have evidence that is not based on entertaining a four year old child at bedtime!  I mean, I have my own UFO story, that more entertaining than all of these combined!  So, if you want an unintentional laugh, this is for you!",1341964800,5,885,4.425925925925926

This movie is a good step toward uncovering the lies that have us enslaved to polluting energy sources and fear-based aggression that only serve our so called leaders.

4100061,3,B003A837Z4,"It Stinked. well it was alrgiht, Jim Mars & stanton Freedman are always entertaining and there was some good information but not as detailed as other sources and this video just went on too long about politics instead of concentrating on more stories about UFO's. As the other review stated, the video lost focus and just becamse random bits of stories, plus the german narrator could barely speak english so that didn't make much sense. But I need to watch again to give it a completely fair review.",1338595200,,500,4.693181818181818
4100062,4,B003A837Z4,"I don't know about fast walkers, but at the risk of sounding like a UFO chaser.........It's an entertaining and fascinating video about some strange goings-on. Is it true?......Who knows.....There's a lot that has gone on and is currently going on that involves the government, that defies logical explanation. That's how speculation becomes a breeding ground for rumor and allegation. Not any more bizarre than trying to say a President was killed, in broad daylight, with surgical precision, by a mediocre shooter, an undercover FBI agent, named Lee Harvey Oswald........All I'm saying is....the more you know about something....sometimes...the crazier it sounds.....",1335398400,6,669,5.7

I agree that the UFO cover-up is very frustrating. I believe that there must be an attempt to establish some form of communication with aliens for mutual benefit, as said in the end of this DVD.",1297555200,3,302,4.11864406779661
8392887,4,B003A837Z4,"A very informative and mostly factual UFO presentation. I do NOT believe the stories of the abduction witnesses, in this DVD, however. Let me just say as an astrobiology graduate, that although I do believe we have been, and are being visited by EBEs and UAPs, any claims by witnesses that they have been in contact with intelligent lifeforms from Jupiter or Venus is totally bogus. There may be microbial life in possible oceans on Europa and Ganymede, but not on, or within the clouds of Jupiter. Venus may have some sort of microbial life within its upper clouds where it is more amenable to such a possibilty, but not deep within the cloud structure or on the surface of Venus. No extremophiles known to biology or zoology could exist at temperatures of 900 degrees F, winds well over 200mph and sulfuric acid rains/ molten lava that occur on Venus.  I am also leery when I hear some one say that they were in touch with intelligent life from the Pleiades. The Pleiades is an open cluster of stars where some new born or very young suns exist. Those stars are light years away from each other.
The Pleiades is NOT one solar system. So what is going on here, is that some witnesses are extrapolating an entire star cluster as a source for one exo-civilization. Scientists know better than to be fooled in such a way, while the layman will be conducive to believe such an absurd claim because the name Pleiades sounds so convincing in and of itself.",1527638400,,1451,4.5807692307692305

I am not having the ""if there are"" or ""if there not"" debate ... these people are insane. And funny.
Its no wonder aliens hide from us!!!
