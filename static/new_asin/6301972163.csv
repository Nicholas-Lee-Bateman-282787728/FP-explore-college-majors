405255,1,6301972163,"LEGEND OF THE LOST is a total wipe-out. Not a single redeemable sequence in this absurd tale of buried treasure out in the desert. What were Wayne and Sophia Loren thinking, signing on for this tripe? And director Henry  Hathaway had been around for decades, couldn't he see the train wreck this  was?

405352,2,6301972163,"Legend of the Lost stars John Wayne and Sophia Loren and takes place in the Sahara desert. Hard-drinking, hard-living experienced guide Joe January (Wayne) reluctantly joins a desert treasure hunting expedition led by Paul Bonnard (Rossano Brazzi), a man obsessed with proving his dead fathers claim to have discovered a lost city. Dita (Loren), a former prostitute, becomes infatuated with Paul and his willingness to overlook her past. She tags along, despite Joes protests, but during their trek Joe and Dita become attracted to each other, creating tension.

For a film touted as having an exotic mix of action, suspense and romance, Legend of the Lost is more romantic triangle than action adventure. Most of the suspense derives from the two men attracted to Dita in a punishing environment that creates jealousy. Director Henry Hathaway (True Grit, How the West Was Won) filmed the movie on location in Libya, providing the film with an authentic look.

Wayne turns in his usual tough guy performance, but Brazzi is totally miscast, and Loren, though beautiful, isn't very effective. There is minimal chemistry among the three leads, which ultimately makes for a tedious slog until the final fade-out. Director Hathaway doesnt even amp things up with action. Theres a fist fight and some gun play at the end, but not nearly enough exciting moments to satisfy.

There are no bonus materials on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release.",1513123200,2,1439,5.141025641025641

There are a few inconsistencies and maybe not the best music but you can get lost in the story and have fun speculating as to what is happening next.

405507,3,6301972163,"This 1957 Italian-American curiosity is not a good film, but by moments I still kind of enjoyed watching it, for many reasons, which will be described with more detail below. This review contains LIMITED SPOILERS.

""John Wayne, Sophia Loren and a French gendarme walk into a bar in Timbuktu..."" ...))) Sorry, I couldn't resist...))) This is more or less how this film actually begins and with such an opening, it is immediately clear that it cannot be treated entirely seriously. The story occurs I think somewhere in the very last years of XIX century. The main character is an American adventurer named Joe January (John Wayne) a kind of cowboy, who somehow migrated to Sahara and got stranded in Timbuktu. The second main character is Dita (Sophia Loren), a prostitute and occasional pickpocket, who  notwithstanding her AMAZING looks  somehow cannot leave Timbuktu either Then arrives a certain Paul Bonnard (Rossano Brazzi) a distinguished gentleman, who wishes to investigate the disappearance of his father, who went deep into the Sahara some time ago and vanished. And then the film begins.

I have a strong impression, that this film was for Henry Hathaway and John Wayne mostly a pretext to take some holidays in Rome and in Libya - they were indeed both pretty busy people and they definitely needed a break and also some R&R in an exotic (for Americans) location. The scenario was clearly written with little care and a great haste, as it recycles a lot of older material, like ""King Solomon's mines"" (the whole story), ""Casablanca"" (a shamelessly corrupt French official) and some of Duke's westerns (almost every scene). It was not even reviewed thoroughly, as it contains at least one enormous blunder  at one moment Joe January speaks about a man and a woman finding a treasure and then living together like ""Solomon and Bathsheba"" (Bathsheba was Solomon's mother, not lover).

The film is not very well made and in fact a little bit boring, as ultimately not so much happens and what does is perfectly predictable. Some scenes are actually kind of embarrassingly bad However, once I decided that this film is actually a kind of cinematographic curiosity created by Hathaway and Wayne during a kind of ""Roman holidays"", I found it watchable, by moments even entertaining. It helped that I simply love John Wayne in virtually anything and Sophia Loren, who was at that time barely 24 years old, is quite obviously a feast for the eyes

Bottom line, this is a film mostly for John Wayne and/or Henry Hathaway fans, who want to see all of their films or amateurs of cinematographic curiosities. For everybody else this film will probably be a loss of time and money. I am not yet certain if I will keep the DVD for another viewing.",1460592000,,2744,4.862955032119914

405509,5,6301972163,"Sophia Loren is 110 in the shade, both figuratively, and literally.

The Legend of the Lost boasted the one-time-only teaming of John Wayne and Sophia Loren. Location-filmed in the Sahara desert, the story concerns the efforts of Wayne, Loren and Rosanno Brazzi to locate a missing treasure in the ruins of ancient Timgrad.

Loren's best movie by far is, ""Boy on a Dolphin"", second best would be, ""Houseboat"".  Good quality copies of, ""Boy on a Dolphin"" can be a little hard to come by, but they DO exist.

In addition to Sophia Loren's flawless looks. She had that rare ability to attract men by somehow managing to be good and bad at the same time.

405632,4,6301972163,"As a film, this is a little known gem that benefits from the appearance of Sophia Loren, the locale of the Sahara, and a few sly, sarcastic one liners from Wayne. I personally like how his character is significantly, but not completely, different from his archetype. The film does bog down towards the middle-end, but it's worth a watch. The Blu-ray format of the film beautifully renders the original. There is some shading at the top of the night scenes that I think is a function of the ""night"" effect placed on the shot rather than a poor transfer or corrupted film. The disc itself is very sleek and has a nice finished, routered feel to the edges... Though the disc feel is not why you're buying the film. The German Blu-ray format was the only one I could find, just double check your Region Code prior to purchasing (works in the USA on my Sony Blu-ray player). The only slight inconvenience was slogging through the German menu, not really an inconvenience at all but necessary if you want to watch it with the original voice/ soundtrack. Overall, very satisfied with this rare gem.",1419120000,3,1091,4.628865979381444

This was one of Wayne's nine collaborations with Director, Henry Hathaway, the first being ""Shepherd of the Hills"" in 1941 and the last being ""True Grit"" in 1969. The first was a very good movie; the last, arguably Wayne's best; this one is only mediocre. Teaming up with Sophia Loren and Rossano Brazzi for the only time in his career, Wayne does his best w/what he's given; but the plot is weak and the dialogue is laughable in parts. In fact this movie is entertaining more for the campy nature of the plot and the dialogue than for any cinematic merit. Watch it to see Wayne and a very young Sophia Loren in one of her first American film roles and for some first rate cinematography. Loren, even though covered in an ankle length dress, still manages to show off her legs to good advantage and several strategic tears appear mysteriously at the top of the dress...I wonder why...:-)",1361577600,3,1007,4.569060773480663

405805,3,6301972163,"John Wayne transplants his usual hard-bitten ""western"" loner character to Timbuktu and the Sahara.  This makes for some strikingly bright and colorful cinematography.  John Wayne's character remains a mystery, however, which might have added some much-needed content to this film if it had been brought out more, perhaps through allusions to past events in the dialogue.  At one point, we discover that Wayne's character can read Latin-- a revelation rich in possibilities, indeed.  Instead, we find the relationship between Wayne and Sophia Loren (as a Berber runaway-waif and bar-girl) unclear, to say the least, which makes Loren's hook-up with a sophisticated French adventurer (Rossano Brazzi) less intriguing than it might have been if we knew more.

The three of them take donkeys, not camels, into the Sahara on a wild goose search for a lost civilization and treasure, with plenty of three-way interactions, some philosophizing, and, ultimately, a tragic ending.",1314489600,3,971,5.446666666666666
405806,3,6301972163,"John Wayne as an Indiana Jones rogue would be a stretch for even his most fervent admirers. That's exactly what you get in the polished though plodding 1957 desert epic ""Legend of the Lost."" Time has not been kind to what must have been a major film for its time, a teetering mix of adventure and mysticism. An international production if ever there was one, you have on-location filming in Libya, the teaming of iconic Wayne with Italian actors Sophia Loren and Rossano Brazzi, surly western director Henry Hathaway, classical Italian composer Angelo Francesco Lavagnino (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-for-Django/dp/B000027QJ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem for Django</a>) and hard-boiled newspaperman turned screenplay writer Ben Hecht (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hecht-The-Man-Behind-the-Legend/dp/0684189801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben Hecht: The Man Behind the Legend</a>). Such a jumble of varied personalities makes for an uneven journey.

Everyone loves a treasure hunt and Wayne battling the Sahara desert in search of a lost city of gold would appear to be the stuff of great matinees. Filmmakers were going for a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Solomon-s-Mines/dp/B0006B2A7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Solomon's Mines</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre-Blu-ray/dp/B001P829VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [Blu-ray</a>], and there are moments when the film strikes a few veins. I like the valley of the tarantulas, a raging sandstorm, an eerie mirage and even the lost city ruins (filmed at the 1100 BC Roman remains of Leptis Magna). But the actors have little chemistry en route and Brazzi, in the crucial role of Paul Bonnard, delivers barely discernible English with the thickest of accents. A good adventure needs a fast-talker, and you'll find nary a one in this head-scratching cast.

Wayne plays salty desert rat Joe January (gotta love that name), awash in booze in Timbuktu. He's hired by the sophisticated Paul Bonnard (Brazzi) to guide a no-frills expedition into the Sahara heat. Bonnard strikes up a midnight conversation with local prostitute Dita (Loren), imbuing her with renewed self-respect and hope. Eventually, this truculent trio is traveling by way of donkeys over beautiful sand dunes on a quest for storied lost riches. At night, camped next to a convenient oasis by the light of crackling campfires, they bicker, sip liquor, flirt and discuss the dreams and miseries of their lives. Though not without merits, the story is far too leisurely, but the scenery is magnificent.

Brazzi's Bonnard, philosophical and bookish, is traveling the same route of his father, who searched for the city years before only to disappear. An obsessive quest for sure, but once the gold is discovered he's going to use the unimaginable riches to benefit the less fortunate. It's clear early on Brazzi and Loren's characters are in love, and I like the dynamic of Wayne's manly man left out of the romantic loop. The film was on to something. But Wayne was a massive star and Hollywood wasn't about to go against formula and have a ravishing woman, even one as independent as Loren, refuse to succumb to his masculine allure.

Loren, one of the most beautiful women in film history, was at the height of sexual prowess in 1957, and she's exploited throughout ""Legend of the Lost."" She bathes nude in an oasis, sleeps with seductive bare legs wiggling from beneath a blanket and wears a dress with increasingly revealing tears. Wayne can't keep his eyes off her and eventually, neither can Brazzi. Do they find the fabled treasure? Well, let's just say the moody chords of Lavagnino's music wails like a supernatural banshee, driving ridiculous points home. The film abruptly collapses into an implausible mess as Brazzi loses sanity and races back to Timbuktu with the donkeys. Wayne and Loren, stranded on foot, attempt to catch him while the sun beats down ever so mercilessly.

Hecht's screenplay tries to add dimensions to these clunky characters, and there are interesting conversations before everything soars off the rails. Ultimately, the surreal ""Legend of the Lost"" is a sloppy exercise lacking the necessary instincts for great adventure. There's something fascinating about seeing Wayne out of his element, and his Joe January bares a resemblance to Indy Jones down to the floppy hat. That's the only comparison one can realistically find with the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark-Special-Edition/dp/B0014Z4OMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>.

405808,2,6301972163,"""Legend of the Lost"" will appeal to John Wayne fans. Set in the 1950s in Africa (The Sahara around the city of Timbuktu), on the face of it the film revolves around archeology and treasure hunting. In reality, it is another Duke western, with the Duke wearing a modified cowboy hat, with a modified holster and six gun, riding a modified horse (actually a donkey he calls ""Janet""), and stalked at times by modified Indians (actually Arabs on camels). This western theme is emphasized by the choice of director, the great Henry Hathaway.

Hathaway and Wayne worked together on 6 films, including ""Shepherd of the Hills"" (1941), ""North to Alaska"" (1960), and ""Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965). Hathaway specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""5 Card Stud"" (1968) and ""Shootout"" (1971). Along with John Ford and Howard Hawks, he was a master of the western, although curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935). It was Hathaway who directed ""True Grit"" (1969), the western that won Wayne his only Oscar.

The great Ben Hecht (1894-1964) supplies the screenplay.  Hecht had 6 academy award nominations and won 2 times (""Underworld"" and ""The  Scoundrel""). Among his 150+ films are such memorable ones as  ""Scarface"" (1932), ""Front Page"" (1945),  ""Notorious"" (1946),  and ""Gunga Din"" (1939). Westerns were not his forte. But he did have to his credit ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""Duel in the sun"" (1946).

Wayne's co-stars are Sophia Loren and Rossano Brazzi. There is a very brief appearance by Kurt Krasznar.

Sophia Loren was mostly a sex symbol when this film was made, although she had performed admirably in films like ""Boy on a Dolphin"" and ""the Pride and the Passion"" both of which came out in 1957. In 1960 she made ""Two Women"" for which she won an Oscar, and was nominated in 1964 for ""Marriage Italian Style"". Her acting in this film is pretty poor, but she is a pleasure to watch.

Rossano Brazzi (1916-1994) is best known for his musicals, including ""Three Coins in a Fountain"" (1954) and ""South Pacific"" (1958). He does a good job as a man searching for the lost treasure.

Jack Cardiff (1914-2009) is the cinematographer. Cardiff was nominated for an Oscar 4 times and won once in 1947 (""Black Narcissus""). His career spanned 70 years and involved more than 70 films. He worked in various genres on films like ""Rambo"" (1985), ""Conan the Destroyer"" (1984), ""The Vikings"" (1958), and ""War and Peace"" (1956). The photography in this film is exceptional, as one might expect with Hathaway directing and Cardiff shooting.

The film was produced by Wayne's own company Batjac. Wayne started producing his own films in 1953 and ultimately made 30 films, the most famous of which was ""The Alamo"" (1960) in which he starred. ""Legend of the Lost"" was their 7th film.

Wayne fans will enjoy the film. The Duke plays his usually hard drinking tough guy with a past, who ultimately is a good and decent man and when under pressure, will do the right thing. And you'll enjoy the scenes of the roman ruins in Libya and the great photography. But don't hope for any action and be prepared for endless trekking through the desert in search of water, which makes up nearly half the film.",1294531200,,3309,4.78421052631579

405891,5,6301972163,"Ok, the story began on a rather incoherent note, and it certainly flew in the face of realism to see anybody camping out in an African jail and, for anything, threatening not to leave.

Some have questioned the realism of an apparently saintly character turning black instantaneously, but I challenge the notion that it really happened in such a fashion, as it did not appear so to me. People who live by unrealistic principles often hide the ticking time-bomb of lunacy and evil, which can be ignited when the ego which has maintained such an image is confronted with a shocking personal loss, the temptation of greed, and an obsessive sense of entitlement. Suddenly, they understand their god doesn't control much at all, and then Wayne's character rightly points out how it's the missionary who had been using his said god to control the world around himself. He wasn't prepared mentally for the lawlessness and brutality of the desert world which he had stepped into. The higher they get, the harder they fall.

Altogether, the movie was very entertaining, with lots of funny John Wayne one-liners, despite any holes in the storyline. The dialogue certainly provided food for thought on ambition vs. character, the brutal reality of life outside of civilization bubble, and the corruption of greed, but it's no surprise that it's more than those who are like the missionary character can handle.",1274918400,,1399,4.9743589743589745

405894,3,6301972163,"The DVD uses the same master as the VHS release. The video is fine but the audio has been subjected to a sharp high frequency filter followed by heavy-handed dynamic noise suppression. Noise suppressors accelerate the natural decline in volume of a spoken word; trailing sibilants as well as softly spoken words are especially vulnerable and may be entirely eliminated. The result is clipped, abrupt speech which is not only uncomfortable to hear but often difficult to understand. Other effects of noise suppressors include pumping of background sounds, loss of background ambience and disappearance of low-level detail. In some cases, aggressive noise suppression can make a film unwatchable (try sitting through the print of ""Jamaica Inn"" which Turner has shown in recent years).

In this release of ""Legend of the Lost,"" serious degradation of the audio from noise suppression makes the film very tedious to view. I watch it with subtitles to make it easier to understand what's being said.

As Criterion has demonstrated, it is possible to get good audio from older films, even those as far back as the thirties. Right now, too many studios seem to assign the audio portion of a DVD release to stone-eared individuals who think cranking up the high frequency filters and the noise suppressors is the way to make an older film sound like ""Star Wars."" The predictable outcome, as in the case of this release of ""Legend of the Lost,"" is a seriously mangled, sometimes unlistenable soundtrack.",1257033600,3,1494,5.069105691056911

405896,3,6301972163,"This is a very interesting movie, however, it is not a very good movie in that the script, if they used one, moves very slowly going almost nowhere. One of the best elements of the film is the ancient Roman city of Timgad of 100 A.D.in modern day Algeria where the film was shot. The city is one of the best examples of the Roman grid pattern of cities and was originally brought into being as a frontier bastion against the mobile Berber tribes. The city yet today retains all of it historical charm that this film exibited.

I'm old enough that I saw this movie in a regular theatre when it was released back in '57, on that fact mainly I bought a copy of the DVD, would it still be as I remembered. Yes and no.  The movie is entertaining, it isn't every movie that allows one a front row seat to the Sahara desert, and one that is in living color, too. Although in shooting the movie several sound stages were also used. I noticed too the unevenness of the movie, especially in the beginning scenes, when once in the desert the acting becomes smoother. Maybe they were more tired due to the prolonged heat and didn't have the energy to overact, as some of the earlier scenes come across as somewhat contrived and shrill.

The movie for me is better than a ""3"" and not quite a ""4"" rating, but given John Wayne's normal choices for making a movie, I give him credit for stepping out to do something atypical such as this. Sophia Loren is adequate in her role, with Rosanna Brazzi doing his normal fair job. The theme of looking for a ""lost"" city has been done many times and one would have wished they had built a little better script for this one to carry the story along.

Movie is well worth watching and is good entertainment. One cannot ask much more than that.

405897,1,6301972163,"High hokum, even for late '50's Hollywood.  Poor Loren (23) is stuck with another pair of geezers for leading men (Wayne was 50).  Compared to most of the actors the studios were trying to pair her with, maybe lover/mentor Carlo Ponti didn't look so ancient in comparison.

Loren, Wayne, and Brazzi spend most of the film stumbling around the Sahara looking for a lost city.  There are some great postcard shots of what I believe may be the magnificent Roman city of Leptis Magna, in northwestern Libya.  But this isn't a postcard...it's a motion picture.  Veteran helmer Hathaway does his best with what may be one of Ben Hecht's worst writing efforts.  The brilliant Technicolor cinematography overwhelms what is supposed to be an intimate portrait of three disparite characters.

Despite supposedly wandering endlessly in one of the hottest places on Earth, nobody gets so much as sunburned and Loren's coiffure and makeup stay intact.  She's wearing a full-length dress and it never occurs to any of the characters that she'd be better off removing the skirt and putting something on her head to ward off the relentless sun.  Wayne's Joe January may be gallant, but sensible fellow that he is, his gallantry never extends to offering the suffering Loren his hat (which would have made for a cute shot).  January's character would have dumped the obviously nutzo Brazzi ten minutes into their ordeal.

There's no spark between Wayne and Loren until the very end, and what there is, is all Loren's doing.  Their characters repeatedly approach death from dehydration and then miraculously recover their energy like Wile E. Coyote. Endless jabbering, badly matched studio shots...it's so dull you can't even get angry at it.  But I did get a kick out of the last scene, where Loren spots a passing nomad caravan and waves frantically to them (she's supposed to be near-death from thirst, remember), yelling to the wounded Joe, ""They're coming, Joe, they're coming!"" as several camel riders peel off their direction.

The nomadic Tuareg I've met are good folks, but in that time and place the likelihood is that given the situation presented, they'd slit Joe January's throat and enslave Loren.",1213833600,4,2193,5.002754820936639

405944,3,6301972163,"This lesser known John Wayne film is the poster child for what happens when a film is miscast.  There are many reasons why this film is largely invisible among many better Wayne films, but the primary reason in my view is that there is absolutely no connection between the the three main characters.  The actors couldn't relate to each other, and the result is a dry, stilted performance by all.  John Wayne is horribly miscast in this role, he is too `American' and too closely identified with the American Western.  He is not at all convincing as the `African adventurer'.  The biggest problem with this film is Rossano Brazzi, though.  He makes absolutely no connection with either Loren or Wayne.  Other problems with this film include poor dialogue and a lack of clarity as to where this film was going (is it an adventure film?  a character study of two men in a love triangle?  a Christian-themed film?).

The basic premise of this film is a search in the desert for lost treasure in the Sahara.  John Wayne's character leads Brazzi out into the desert in search of a lost city and lost treasure supposedly discovered by Brazzi's father several years earlier.  Loren plays a prostitute in Timbuctu who joins the pair.  Coming several years after the vastly better `King Solomon's Mines', this film shares several similar plot threads.  In spite of the hyperbole, this really isn't much of an adventure film.  It is more of a vehicle to get the Italian hottie out in the desert alone with two very different men and explore their reactions and underlying motivations.

The first 3/4 of this film are largely forgettable, but I've rated it at 3 stars because the film makes a dramatic recovery in the last 20 minutes.  Brazzi is mostly gone, and it is in the last few sequences when we see some real connection between Wayne and Loren.  Brazzi treated Loren like a prostitute, and Wayne treats her like a woman who deserves respect, no matter what she has done.  Both Loren and Wayne discover themselves and each other in the final few sequences.  Wayne has a great line about faith in God and faith in men.  The bottom line is that this is a seriously flawed film on several levels, although the final twenty minutes make it worth the price of admission.",1189555200,2,2260,4.670886075949367

John Wayne as Joe January, drunken guide.  Sophia Loren as Dita, a prostitute...do they ever look this good?  Brazzi as a starry eyed treasure hunter and do-gooder.  What a package.  Henry Hathaway did a terrific job directing and Jack Cardiff does a terrific job with the photography.

Unlike other reviewers I think the soundtrack is perfectly aligned with the movie.  The movie uses the desert as a fourth character.  In the movie the desert is set up to be a strange and eerie place, especially the lost city they eventually end up in.  Lost city, lost treasure, and finally a betrayl. The music supports this very well.

I give this movie pretty high marks.  The story line is very credible.  Brazzi's character shows up wanting to go into the desert to search for his father.  Waynes character is hired.  Before they can leave, Brazzi charms Sohia Loren's character and she manages to show up in the desert at Wayne's and Brazzi's first camp, escorted by desert nomads. Together the three travel the desert.  They eventually end up out of water and stumble into a lost city, the real goal of Brazzi.

Mr. Krasner is cast as a French policeman in Timbuktu.  The actor was often cast in exotic, foreign sounding roles.  The problem was that, in Legend of the Lost, he never attempted a French accent.  In fact, he never changed his accent or his delivery in any of his films. Ever! The fight scenes between Brazzi and Wayne (there are far too many of them) are amaturish; one camera angle actually shows Brazzi throwing a punch that misses Wayne's jaw by a good 12 inches!  Where was the director, Henry Hathaway, a seasoned vertan, when this happened?  The soundtrack element used for this DVD transfer was very poor; it has a thin, tin-like quality.

405951,4,6301972163,"""Legend of the Lost"" is a morality tale of sorts which follows the journey of three disparate souls searching for lost treasure in the vast Sahara Desert.  The trio is comprised of Joe January, played by John Wayne, who is a hard living, hard drinking guide; Paul Bonnard, a would-be missionary played by Rossano Brazzi; and Dita, portrayed by Sophia Loren, who is a prostitute and petty thief transformed by Paul's piety.
The sought-after treasure was originally discovered by Paul's father.  But when it is revealed that his father is not the saint Paul thought him to be, Paul is corrupted. Greed and lust overtake him eventually leading to tragedy.
Paul's instantaneous and wicked conversion seems somewhat preposterous as he had purportedly lived a virtuous life up until the discovery of the treasure and the remains of his father.  The entire plot strains credibility.
But it is the motley and gifted cast that fascinates. Wayne's Joe January is a crude, hard-bitten soul.  But underneath that rough exterior, you know that he is a decent man especially since he is portrayed by Duke Wayne.  Wayne has a reassuringly quiet strength and an unselfconscious vulnerability that always make his characterizations believable.  Wayne's characters are strong men, but not super men (ala Schwarzenegger or Stallone). His characters are realistic.  They can be brought down, hurt, and compromised.
Rossano Brazzi gives an almost giddy, operatic interpretation of a good man gone bad.  It's amusing to watch his character degenerate.  And Sophia Loren has an untamed beauty and wild impetuousness which is electrifying.
So perhaps one can forgive the hokey plot of ""Legend of the Lost"", the occasional poor sound quality, and the rather cheesy musical score.  It is the charismatic, talented cast and the magnificently sun-drenched, barren landscape of the Sahara Desert that make this movie rather thrilling and worth your time.",1036713600,47,1925,5.220779220779221
