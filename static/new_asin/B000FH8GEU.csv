8316127,4,B000FH8GEU,"This has a mix of good and bad public domain animation just like the other Toon Factory $1 DVDs, however, this one stands out because it includes famed animation director John Hubley's 1959 Academy Award-winning short ""Moonbird."" This short is also on ""The Hubley Collection - Volume 1"" DVD, but that costs upwards of $20! It's a brilliant short and worth more than the price of this $1 DVD. There's also a notable Orson Welles-narrated short from 1971 called ""Freedom River.""

The 17 shorts in this collection are:
1) The Big Bad Wolf
2) Toonerville Picnic
3) Flop Goes the Weasel
4) Freedom River
5) Frozen Frolics
6) A Scout with the Gout
7) To Spring
8) Goofy Goofy Gander
9) Ding Dong Doggie
10) Wolf! Wolf!
11) Bored of Education
12) Snubbed by a Snob
13) Moonbird
14) Gold Rush Daze
15) Shuteye Popeye
16) Out to Punch
