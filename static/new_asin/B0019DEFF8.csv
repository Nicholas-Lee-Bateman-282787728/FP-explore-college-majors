8273632,5,B0019DEFF8,"This was a very sad and yet an uplifting film. The storyline was interesting, the characters played excellent and it showed some of the harshness, struggle and dangers the people trying to emigrate experience. It is uplifting because there are lots of people showing human compassion and willing to give help making this impossible journey possible. Highly recommended.",1384819200,,369,5.379310344827586
