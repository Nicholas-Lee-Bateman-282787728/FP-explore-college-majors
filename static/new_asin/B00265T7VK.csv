3851461,4,B00265T7VK,"I've become very interested in this subject over the last couple year. This video gave alot of good information about Crowley, who he was and why he did some of the thnigs he did.",1360540800,,179,4.294117647058823
3851462,2,B00265T7VK,"A rather poor production. The actors playing the parts are not really credible and by the time one gets to the actor playing Victor Neuburg I was about to laugh at the pathetic little man on the screen who looked like a cross between Senator Harry Reid and Pee Wee Herman. In addition the accounted narration and use of voice seems to go from trying to creep one out to cause one to laugh. The narrator never seems to figure out that Crowley's rather odd life and story does not require campfire ghostly embelishments to tell a interesting story but rather ironically,these additions make the whole narrative comical and unbelievable. The actor playing Crowley seems to do just as poor a job portraying Crowley as a man in a knee slaping mode laughing at his antics in regards to his immoral egotist adventures to getting one up on the Gods. Even more strangely this incredible telling of events seems to totally ignore any notion of verification or analysis of any of magickal accounts given by Crowley or to even try to explain the methods Crowley was employing for half a century-this is just passed over. Perhaps Crowley is a rather hard character to portray but I could see the likes of George C.Scott or many other actors up to the task....anyway,the use of photographs readily avaliable from the time are scantly used which is a big disappointment and those that are used and framed to looked cracked and aged where they are almost unviewable. The overall feel is the narration reads something like a book report written by a high school student reading Crowley's confessions for the first time. Eventually,a good movie will be made on Crowley,Yeats,Mathers,and The Golden Dawn Magicians but this is not it. This is a story that needs to be told but not in this way-my advice,try again.",1279324800,9,1793,4.75
3851463,3,B00265T7VK,"In fairness I am never a fan of documentaries that feature actors playing the documentary subjects. That being said the actor portraying Crowley creates a version of the man that is very charming, probably best described as impish. I would not go SO far to say that this is a completely even handed documentary but it's by far the least clouded with all the ""satanic"" nonsense surrounding the man.  I am desperately waiting for a PBS/BBC style documentary where those who are contemporary experts in the GD or AA (such as DuQuette, Regardie, etc) are either interviewed or excerpted to give a much rounder view of this almost impossibly complicated man. My biggest criticism of the film is that any and all archival images are inexplicably superimposed with an other image of crackled earth, making many images difficult to make out; sometimes obscuring them all together. As the title of the review says, if you are just taking your first steps to understanding the man, then I don't hesitate to recommend this.  If you've read any biographies, Lon Milo DuQuette's outstanding works on Crowley and Thelema&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magick-of-Aleister-Crowley-A-Handbook-of-the-Rituals-of-Thelema/dp/1578632994/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magick of Aleister Crowley: A Handbook of the Rituals of Thelema</a>&nbsp;for example, or any of the writings of the great beast himself, you could probably skip this and not miss too much.",1266796800,12,1484,5.710407239819005
3851464,5,B00265T7VK,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was shot on location in wonderful Shepperton, England, and the voice narration by Joss Ackland is excellent. There are many actors and actresses in this film who do a good job dramatizing some of the real life characters who played a major role in shaping Aleister Crowley's life. Some of these characters include; Allan Bennett, Samuel Mathers, Rose Kelly, Victor Neuberg, Oscar Eckenstein, Leah Hirsig, Lord Beaverbrook, Betty May, and Israel Regardie.

Aleister Crowley, himself, is well dramatized by Actor, Thomas Bewley. It should be noted this is not a movie about Crowley's Magickal Theory and Practice. Instead, this is a movie about what may have influenced Crowley to pursue Magick in the first place. The film attempts to give the viewer a summary of all the most important events which shaped Aleister Crowley,s life and work. What you get is a great overview of Crowley,s Occult accomplishments, warts and all. Crowley,s love of poetry and mountain climbing is mentioned right alongside his love of prostitutes, sodomy with men and women, adulterous affairs, failed marriages, drug addiction/experimentation, health problems, Yoga practice, the demise of the Golden Dawn, the revival of the OTO under Aleister Crowley,s leadership, the founding of the A.A., and the creation of Crowley,s Masterwork: The Book of the Law.

Buy this film today my fellow seekers and let us all revel in the Night of Pan!",1266451200,12,1447,5.153191489361702
3851465,3,B00265T7VK,"In Search of the Great Beast 666 - the movie (about Aleister Crowley):

I bought this movie last year, in 2008, as a Region 0, PAL - DVD, of course I couldn't watch it on my regular USA type NTSC type DVD player and TV.  Anyway, I watched it on my PC which was able to play it.  I was hoping for more and better as a movie about Aleister Crowley.  I still am.  This one was okay, but, really, not much.  What does it really convey if you are really interested and want to learn?  Very little.  In fact if you have already been interested and into Aleister Crowley and already have done any significant learning beyond the limited initial steps, and stages, from the many available sources, you will probably find this pretty void of any material of any significant value to you, as you may already know this much, and more contained herein.  All it is about is giving you just a little bit of the story of Aleister Crowley, and having an actor to portray him as a character.  It gives you some audio and visual, instead of just reading words.  Don't expect much.  Expect a tabloid level of superficiality in the portrayal of a person, that is merely extended into the audio and visual, rather than limited to words, only.  Because that is what you get with this.  Continue learning about Aleister Crowley in other ways, such as reading.  You might enjoy it a bit as entertainment, of course.  But somewhat limited, even at that.  I don't give it a bad rating, it's just not that good.  I was a little disappointed, is all.  I was hoping it would be better, more involved, more interesting, more informative.  Just more.  It wasn't.  I still await a better movie about Aleister Crowley.

Well researched up until the final 15 minutes where they make a leap in logic trying to show how Barbara Bush's mother lived in close enough proximity to have likely slept with Crowley when he was already pennyless and 60 years old then later giving birth to Barbara. More than a bit of a stretch. Especially since Crowley's diaries never mentioned Pauline Pierce being part of his Satanic Rituals and it would be out of character since in all other sexual escapades in the documentary only mention him having sex with prostitutes or one of his wives.

Other than this foolishness that is perhaps meant to slander republicans, the documentary is definetely the most detailed of any biographical account of the beast. They use an actor to portray crowly speaking autobiographically that does a really good job of showing how immoral and sociopathic crowley's thinking often was. Normalizing things like animal torture, bragadocious sex escapades, and the search for magick by any means necessary. There's a part where a statement made by a friend of crowley's says he was a loose cannon and I really don't doubt that description.

I myself am a Christian and watched this video to learn what the ""wickedest man in the world"" had to say about his life. It looks like he was a pawn of demonic forces of evil and died a pennyless and lost soul. Salvation is so easy. Why didn't he chose it? His father was one of the Plymouth Bretheren so was all of this a vain attempt for a boy to prove his father wrong? A lot could be said for the sadly complex psychological puzzle that is aleister crowley. Many people follow his path of ""do what thou wilt."" But few chose the simplicity of accepting Jesus Christ's offer for free salvation. You don't have to do anything, or be a perfect person. Just pray and ask Jesus into your heart. Seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened.",1526601600,,1902,4.657738095238095

8352083,5,B00265T7VK,I watched this documentary and to my delight it seemed to be fairly even in it's tones and presentation about Aleister Crowley. This is refreshing when in the Occult world you either have people that fervently hate or love the man and his works. I am on the fence edge myself. Because I respect his work but also have to acknowledge that he was a bit of a troublemaker.
