3495943,5,B001BN4WKO,"Spongebob has been out for several years but I only became aware of it in December of 2006. That is when my youngest daughter, Emma, was born, and my husband would be up nights with her so I could get some sleep. She is now just over 2 years old and she has 10 to 12 Spongebob DVD's, several stuffed toys (Spongebob, Patrick, or Squidward). She also has several blankets, books that are Spongebob.

The effect Spongebob had on her can be summed up this way: her nursery (pre-birth) WAS Winnie the Pooh. By the time she turned 1, my husband and I had to change her bedroom decor to Spongebob. (Curtains, wall border, stick-on decals.) You name it, she's got it now. I bought her a red Spongebob jacket for Christmas last year. I had to get it from the boys' department at Wal-Mart. Spongebob isn't gender specific at who its viewing audience is. (Emma can name every main character as well.)

Nickelodeon: You could make a killing in the infant/toddler hard and soft lines business with Spongebob. Bedding, wallpaper/borders, clothing(boys AND girls), toys, games, coloring books, etc.

Anyone with young kids will get a kick out of ANY Spongebob cartoon. My husband and I love watching with Emma.",1235174400,,1196,4.685714285714286

He was able to find the episode ""What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?"" on the Complete Fifth Season, but wanted the ""Who Bob What Pants"" version.
