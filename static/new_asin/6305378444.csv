matches belonged on Saturday night. The main event would have been
great if Hall,Disco, and Bigelow hadn't interfered. The only good matches were the Triangle Cruiserweight title match,the one after it, and the main event. WCW has done better.",999129600,,307,5.16
8003256,4,6305378444,"I really enjoyed this video.  I would recommend it to all MLB fans. It is a very well put together video of arguably the best season in baseball history. I expecially enjoyed the detailed look at Sammy Sosa & Mark McGwire's chase of the home run record. I too enjoyed the look back on the New York Yankees masterful run at there second World championship in three years. My only dislike (and the reason I'm only giving it 4 stars) is it, like most sports videos, is kind of short. I think it is well worth the price for those who wish to relive the 1998 season.",983404800,,561,4.242990654205608
