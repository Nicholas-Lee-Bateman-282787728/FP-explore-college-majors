857378,4,6304353464,"Although I describe myself as an advanced workout kind of person, I had a lot of trouble with this one. And I even got sore the next days, which hasn't happened in a long time! The only bad thing about this dvd is that it concentrates mostly on the arms which wasn't in the description of this workout. I would have liked a bit more of thighs and abs, so that is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

I never watched an Kathy Ireland workout before, but I will definitely buy another one.",1111881600,9,498,4.134020618556701
857379,2,6304353464,"There are a host of problems with this tape:
1)  As mentioned by another reviewer, you need alot of space to execute the moves.  Also, dumbbells and a weight bench are necessary.
2)  Poor cueing.  During the cardio sections, Kathy doesn't prep you for what's coming up next.  I imagine over time you'd memorize the cardio section since it's repeated four times, but on the first few times through it's hard to remember what comes next.  Also, she doesn't mirror - she moves her own right leg when she tells you to move right, so if you follow her verbal cues, then you're exercising in the opposite direction shown on the tape.
3)  I couldn't figure out much rhyme or reason to the muscle groups that were targeted during the strength sections.  You exercise shoulders, chest, biceps, and triceps - but no back, abs or lower body (I imagine all the lunging and squatting during the cardio section are meant to target your legs).
4)  Once the cardio routine is brought up to tempo, there are places where it moves pretty fast and seems that even Kathy is having trouble with proper form.
5)  There's not much flow to this workout.  Lots of standing around between sections and even waiting during the cardio section while Kathy finds the beat for the next set of moves.
6)  The talking between the people demonstrating the routine was definitely annoying.  One guy's role seemed to be to remind Kathy of what she was supposed to say next.  ""Kathy, I find that I'm getting as much of a workout when lowering the weights as when I lift them.""  ""That's an excellent point Ross, because...blah, blah, blah.""
In sum, don't waste your time and money on this video!  There are too many other good ones out there.",1073088000,,1704,4.5927152317880795
857380,3,6304353464,"Kathy created this work-out for the intermediate to advanced exercisers and warns about this in her talk at the beginning of the tape. True intermediate to advanced exercisers have probably already found some better tapes for their routine - and if not, they should!
Kathy leads us through this work-out with 4 other cast members, one of which is her own mother who demonstrates an alternate version of easier moves for some of the exercises.
The work out starts out by Kathy teaching a series of steps that is to be used to keep the heart rate up in the cardio sections. These moves are then repeated at a faster pace several times in the work-out with weight lifting sections in between. The cardio routine is not done in time to the music and everyone seems to struggle with it - it just looks clumsy. Then everyone catches their breath, gulps down water and works with weights.
Kathy does give good tips on proper form which are beneficial if you have never worked out with weights. Her cast members help out by asking her questions about form through-out the work-out which she answers. This is nice the first time for those who need this information - by the time you are doing this work-out for the 20th time (which I didn't) you will likely be irritated. Kathy also encourages you to drink water through-out the work-out and does so herself several times. In this sense this work-out shows good and correct exercising practices. If you do not already know that you should keep yourself hydrated and that you should not bend the knee over the toe during lunges then you will indeed be enlightened. For the trully advanced exerciser this will not be news.
The work-out itself is very mediocre. There are TOO many better choices out there for serious fitness to waste time on this one. Unless you are a die-hard Kathy Ireland fan this will not be the best choice for you to do during your precious work-out time.",1024963200,,1917,4.624633431085044
857381,3,6304353464,"I was not greatly pleased with this tape which should actually be for beginners or intermediate level people.  The strength portions of the tape were ok challenge wise but I did not like the cardio section.  It was really slow and it didn't get my heart rate up high enough or for long enough because she only does them for like 5 minutes and then goes into another strength section.
  The tape starts out with a really long talk from Kathy Ireland and then she goes into introducing all the people who will be working out with her (really weird).  This is followed by a quick warmup and then she slowly goes through the cardio circuit which will be repeated 3 times throughout the tape.  The circuit is then brought up to tempo and lasts about 5 minutes tops.  Then there is 3 different strength exercises for the shoulders, the cardio circuit is repeated, 3 strength exercises for the chest, the cardio circuit again, 3 bicep/tricep exercises, then a cool down.
  Good for beginners but not for the advanced who really want to get their heart rate up.  Plus the fact that her own routine is too hard for Kathy and she is out of breath most of the whole way through is kind of ironic.  Also she doesn't know where the beat is in the music and her friends constant chatter is annoying.  It is strange at the end when they all shot water from their water bottles at each other and some guy we don't know comes out and hugs Kathy.  Kind of a strange tape but hey, if you're a beginner stick it out because the strenght moves should be beneficial.",1017273600,2,1544,4.394366197183099

7869411,3,6304353464,The DVD seems great but it stalls in the warm up section each time... the exercises seem to be very good!,1355011200,,105,4.0476190476190474
7869412,1,6304353464,"If I were writing a description for the back of the box, it would go something like this:
""Upper body weightlifting alternated with cardio routine that draws from plyometrics.  Requires hand weights, a bench, and a mat or carpeted surface.""
You can replace the bench by a chair and a step, or if you're ambitious an exercise ball, but you need to be able to sit on something and also lie down on something that allows your elbows to drop below you a little (for bench press and chest flye).  The description on the DVD made me think it was going to be primarily a plyometrics cardio workout (one picture involving weights, but no other mention), when in fact there's limited cardio with only a flavor of plyo; it's primarily weights for the chest, upper back, shoulders and arms.  The cardio part has some lower body work, but it's unweighted, and it also has pushups so I'm not sure it changes the balance significantly.

If the description had been accurate I *might* have gone as high as three stars, but probably would still have stopped at two.  I will not be doing this workout again even though cardio/weights workouts are in my usual routine, which means I found it worse than most of the selections on 10 Best Fitness (http://www.amazon.com/10-Best-fitness-Various/dp/B00006LPBL).  Here is why:
* The cuing and instruction are terrible.  The lifts are supposed to be done two beats up, two beats down and then one beat up, one beat down, but the timing is completely inconsistent.  The cardio segment is taught once, but not well, and then run through with almost no advance warning of what's coming next.  It was incredibly difficult to follow, and not for any good reason, since none of the moves are hard.  The cardio is the same thing every time it is done, also, which meant it would probably go from impossible to decent to boring on short order.
* Compounding the cuing problem are disorienting camera angles, music that nothing is done in time to, and Kathy giving her right and left instead of the mirror/viewer's right and left.
* Finally, there is a ton of downtime as you watch the people on screen move benches in and out of the center and drink water.  The workout is intense enough to require downtime, but when I needed it and when it was given to me were not the same, so I would just as soon pause the disk when I need downtime and not watch them take theirs.",1296777600,5,2386,4.590588235294118
7869413,5,6304353464,"I had been doing this workout on a regular basis many years ago. I recently bought the DVD to update my workout collection. For those who say that you got a good workout, what is your complaint!! Most videos don't even offer that. I love this workout for hard days, and other videos fill in the other days. I have to say that you don't have to listen to the video- play your own music. BE CREATIVE! I would highly recommend this video.",1213142400,2,435,4.253012048192771
7869414,4,6304353464,"...but it is still a good workout.  I personally liked the breaks because it gave me a chance to catch my breath too. LOL!  This workout is a tough circuit workout alternating cardio that mainly targets the lower body with upper body weight segments.  I agree that there are too many reps on the upper body segments but if you're advanced, which the name of the workout suggests you should be, you should know how to modify.  There also was not a great variety of exercises in this workout but I like my workouts simple and who says you have to do 20 different exercises to get good results?  Also, she does not stretch in between sets but I just did that on my own while they set up for the next set.  Yes, she spends a lot of time explaining but if you're advanced, you know to just start the exercise while she's talking.  There is not an ab segment in this workout which I would have liked to see but overall, I liked the workout.  And about the guy who comes running in at the end hugging Kathy and yelling ""you did it"", who sticks around to watch the workout after the stretch?  I know I don't.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the workout.  In fact, most of these negative comments have nothing to do with the workout itself.  If you're the type of person who can focus on the workout itself and not on the minor annoyances that can be found in just about every workout then you will probably enjoy this workout.",1205107200,7,1424,4.272388059701493
7869415,3,6304353464,"Kathy spends too much time explaining proper form, if you are an advanced exerciser you already know proper form.

Too many reps for the weight exercises, and her faster tempo reps are too fast. Instead of flailing my arms about trying to keep up, I go at a slower more controled pace for fewer reps. She does so many reps that even when I go slower, I can do plenty in the same amount of time.

All the weight work is upper body, all the cardio is lower body. Not really my style. There are better videos out there. I felt like it really worked my inner thighs/glutes but not much else.",1198713600,,587,4.232142857142857
7869416,3,6304353464,"Like the other reviewers said, if this is for advanced exercisers, why does the instructor give so much beginner information on form? That would be my biggest gripe about this, that a lot of time is spent giving pointers that beginners can use but intermediates already know. Also, I think the faster tempo reps on the weight exercises are too fast. Instead of flailing my arms about trying to keep up, I do the reps at a slower, more controled pace. She does so many reps that even at a slower pace I get all the reps I need.

7869417,1,6304353464,"This is a tough advanced level workout.  That is the ONLY good thing I can say about it.

First, I think it is too hard for Kathy.  At certain points, she can barely speak, she's so tired.  Other times, her form is terrible because she's tired.

Second, it is terribly boring.  The weight circuits alternate with cardio circuits, but you are doing the SAME cardio circuit each time.  yaaaawwwwnnnnn!

Third, the weight training circuits have you doing two sets of 20 reps per exercise.  I'd rather have three sets of fewer reps or maybe to some different types of exercises for that particular muscle (i.e. 20 bicep curls and 20 hammer curls).

Fourth, no ab work to speak of.

Fifth, Kathy's ""banter"" with the other exercisers is annoying.

Lastly, you will want to reach into the TV and smack Andre (one fo the back-up exercisers) after about 10 minutes.  He's just that irritating and distracting.",1178668800,2,900,4.7290322580645165
7869418,1,6304353464,"As a fan of kathy's first video -- total fitness workout -- i was really looking forward to this one.  I hate to say this but it really stinks -- working out has to be fun, concise, get the job done etc. etc... this isn't fun and it's way too long and just plain boring.  I turned it off after the first 15 minutes -- don't bother buying this one, it's terrible!!  It's not an exercise routine that you would enjoy doing over and over -- what happened????",1147046400,5,455,4.1477272727272725
7869419,2,6304353464,"I don't usually bother reviewing things but I had to say something about this. First off the positives: it is hard and demanding. My muscles were sore the next day. That's it.

The negatives? Well, let's start with the completely amateurish presentation. She may be fit but she comes across as if she doesn't have a clue what she's talking about. She doesn't do mirror cueing which I think is a basic requirement. In the cardio intervals, she has to take breathers so just as you're ready to go onto the next move you have to stop to let her catch up with you. Some of the moves in the cardio intervals I think are not good for lower backs - lots of bending down, touching the floor and back up again sort of thing.

The stretch section at the end is useless. You don't stretch your upper body at all and all the weights sections are for upper body.

And then they finish off with a water fight while some manic bloke shouts 'you did it' over and over again at her.

If you can ignore her and switch off before he jumps out you will get a good workout. But there are plenty of challenging DVDs out there which are much more professional.",1138665600,5,1137,4.274418604651163
