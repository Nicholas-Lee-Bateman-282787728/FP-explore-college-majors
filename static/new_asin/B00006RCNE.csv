Yellowman, Roots Radics, Israel Vibration and Culture make this an absolute must have - the quality on most of the videos is excellent, and I promise you will be skankin' to this the minute you turn it on and ""Rude Boy Shuffling"" (Israel Vibration) starts playing. Enjoy!!!!",1175904000,,493,4.613636363636363
