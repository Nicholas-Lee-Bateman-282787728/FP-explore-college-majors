2260297,5,B0009298NO,It's a fantastic series. Series 5 really let's you see the Harriet Family a little older and life progressing for all of the characters.  I would recommend this series to any lover of rural life - especially in the Yorkshire Dales.,1168300800,3,231,4.634146341463414
2260298,5,B0009298NO,"Anyone who has read the Herriot books will really enjoy these series.  They are true to the flavor and humour of the Herriot stories.  The animals are fun, sad, frustrating but the human characters are often moreso.  It may take a bit of time up front, if you're not familiar with the English/Yorkshire accent, to get used to the local lingo and decipher what they are saying, but it doesn't take long before it's second nature to your ears.  Wonderful stories for children and adults alike.  These are classics, don't pass them up.",1157587200,2,532,4.67741935483871
2260299,5,B0009298NO,"If you enjoy stories about animals, then you will love this.  I highly recommend this series.  I watched it when I was young and I am really looking forward to sharing this wonderful series with my child. It is heartwarming, funny, and is set in the beautiful countryside of the Yorkshire Dales, England.  Of course some of you my recognize the title - James Herriot was the author of the book by the same name; as well as many other books.",1154304000,,440,4.407407407407407
2260300,4,B0009298NO,"The Brits have always managed to produce top shows. My favourite being ""Are You Being Served?"" I think it's the funniest comedy ever made.

Their dramas are no less impressive. I've always been a big fan of All Creatures Great and Small, but am disappointed at the slow pace with which the BBC has released this series on DVD.

Anyone who has watched the original series broadcasts knows there are still series 6 & 7 and one more special titled Brotherly Love, to go before we reach the end.

For some reason the BBC is dragging its heels in bringing this to completion.

The acting from the three main characters (James, Siegfried and Tristan) makes the whole series worthwhile. And the show itself takes us back to a time of innocence, simple pleasures, proud traditions and a less hectic lifestyle.

If there is one criticism I have it's that for people that were supposed to have such a great deal of compassion for pets and people alike, they display very little emotion whether facing tragedy or triumph in the series. I mean, for Pete's sake even Christ was known to have wept.

But these characters forge onward with a stiff upper lip through all trials and tribulations. Sadness is never allowed to be expressed except with disdain. Even when Tristan is off to war before the others all his brother can muster is a handshake and a ""take care"". A tear of joy or sadness now and then would have done wonders for giving their characters a sense of true humanity.

That said, the show is truly entertaining and filled with wit, charm, drama and nostalgia all delivered with fine acting aplomb from most, if not all, of the cast.

It's TV at its finest and highly recommended to all.",1139875200,10,1687,4.6
2260301,5,B0009298NO,"This British Series is one of the greatest ever produced.  We have purchased all 5 Complete Collections and the one-time special.  The actors playing the veterinarians in these series certainly earned their salaries.  In addition, the series contains some really remarkable characters. We recommend these DVD's to everyone.  If there is ever released a Series 6, we will buy that too.",1128988800,8,384,5.245901639344262
2260302,1,B0009298NO,"The quality of the writing slips a little in this fourth season.  The quaintness of the Dales isn't quite as quaint as the series procedes into the 1950s except for the farmer that summons Siegfried to his house to adjust his TV antenna.  Calum Buchanan is not a sympathetic character.  It's hard to understand his combative nature and his love for animals.  Unless I missed something, he is not very lovable.  The actress who plays Helen is stolid and just not up to the original actress' style.  The rest of the cast is as good as ever.",1128211200,10,538,4.494845360824742
2260303,5,B0009298NO,"If you like animals, are not squimish (there are a lot of actual scenes involving surgery, birth and general yuk), and like to laugh you will love this series of DVD's featuring a veterinarian, his practice and his family.

Set in late 1940's and early 1950's, the series is based on real life situations in the Yorkshire Dales of England.  James Herriot's beloved stories published in several books have now been brought to the screen.

I have enjoyed the books and now can enjoy the series on DVD as well.",1124496000,6,507,4.611111111111111
2260304,4,B0009298NO,"This fifth series marked the half way point in All Creatures adventures, after being resurected after WW2. This classic BBC production is no longer based on the books of James Herriot, new writers based stories on the wonderful character performances  of Robert Hardy (Senior partner Seigfried) Peter Davison (Brother Tristan) Christopher Timothy. (James Herriot) In addition to which, there is now colourful Scottish vet Callum Buccannon, intoduced during series 4, to assist the partners in practice, and his love affair with Diedre, former girlfriend of Tristan, is chartered in the episodes.

One continuing handicap of the later series was Carol Drinkwater no longer played Helen Herriot, the role was thereafter the war assumed by Lynda Bellingham, who tended to play every part she got exactly the same. Thus she was never really Helen, simply Lynda Bellingham joining the family. Continuity errors dogged the programme, with things like the all too fast aging of the Herriots children, never again seeing Siegfrieds family.

However, if you can overlook those shortfalls, there are still some wonderful moments to enjoy, with cantankerous farmer Biggins making James life difficult, Seigfrieds frustrations of slow paying clients, the escapades of Callum and Tristan, and gregarious local vet Granville Bennet, all helping to create nostalgic moments to treasure.

The weakest series of All Creaures, but the many fans will still need to complete their collection.",1121644800,24,1472,5.47136563876652
2260305,3,B0009298NO,"My husband and I were disappointed with the fifth season of the "" All Creatures Great and Small Series"". The first three seasons and specials were well written, directed and acted. However in the latter portion of the fourth season and the entire fifth season is appears the BBC cut corners on this production. The writing, acting and directing are mediocre at best. Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy and Peter Davison give outstanding performances as James, Sigfried and Tristian. However we did not care for Linda Bellingham as Helen Herriot. Her performance is cold, she is like a robot going through the motions of saying her lines. Carol Drinkwater gave life, humor and class to Helen. Her performance actually made you believe she is Helen and always will be. Overall this dvd is must for your "" All Creatures Great and Small "" dvd collection if you are a die hard James Herriot fan.",1120435200,61,889,4.816993464052287

2260346,4,B0009298NO,"I read all the previous reviews of other longtime fans of this wonderful, heart-warming series and have to agree with the first four opinions.
Series 5 may be different in that the series no longer is by James Herriot but in fact, written by other writers familiar with the characters of James, Siegfried, Tristan, and James' wife, Helen..
With the new addition of Calum Buchanan, John McGlynn's first series ever, is magical with the added twist of the romantic mishaps of Deirdre, his lady-love.
His portrayal reminds me of the energy that the other vets had during the first series and second. Even more so, tis a part of Calum's nature,his love for animals distracts his whole day on many occasions!
I miss Helen (the first one) in Carol Drinkwater. The real-life romance between Christopher Timothy and Carol Drinkwater is most naturally effervescent and missed in Seasons 4 & 5..
Lynda Bellingham has her own way with the character of Helen Herriot, so one has to adjust.
Still, a worthwhile Series Five, to watch with the whole family. They haven't run out of storylines and worth keeping to share with friends.
Going for Series 6 and beyond!",1315180800,5,1149,4.83756345177665
2260347,5,B0009298NO,"This is referring only to the Amazon Instant Video version.  This is a continuation of the wonderful series of ""All Creatures Great and Small"".  Unfortunately, this version has the music playing over the speaking parts, making it difficult at times to follow what is going on.  The music at the opening and closing are also messed up and seem to be playing two different tracks.  It is a pity, because this is a delightful show.",1300838400,,428,4.666666666666667
2260348,5,B0009298NO,My son is a new veterinarian and just loves this series.  I get them for gifts for him and he likes to watch them one by one savoring each episode.  He says things in his field haven't really changed all that much and the experiences are so real to life as a vet.  I have watched all the series and love them too!,1265068800,,313,3.9365079365079363
2260349,4,B0009298NO,"Series 5 of All Creatures Great and Small keeps alive a much loved collection of humor and poignancy with an agricultural theme that is so universal.  It continues to engage us in the veterinary adventures of the endearing characters of James and Helen Herriot, Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, and Calum Buchannan.  Unfortunately in Series 5, our favorite scamp Tristan fades away to Ireland to make way for heavy focus on Calum's love life in many episodes.  However, each episode does manage to work in at least one of the original story lines from James Herriot's beloved books, quite a feat given this is the fifth year of the series.  As with Series 1-4, if you are quite familiar with the Herriot books, the television versions of his stories can seem somewhat unfaithful and thus less enjoyable at times, but it is always a delight to see his characters in action (including the animals), to hear the Yorkshire accents, and to behold the Yorkshire Dales.  The added story lines are mostly in keeping with Herriot's flavor and can be enjoyed in their own right.  Series 5 is definitely worth adding to your All Creatures Great and Small collection.",1247011200,,1152,4.822335025380711
2260350,5,B0009298NO,I had purchased all of the other series and found out that I didn't have this one. It again is one of the best  BBC series ever made.

2260355,5,B0009298NO,"Although it is many years ago since I first watched 'All Creatures Great and Small' on television, I have never forgotten it, and since it has became available in DVD format, I put it on the top of my wish list, and this past Christmas I got Series 1-5, and have been relishing in them ever since.  How delightful they are - and how I wish today's television had the same delightful, decent, quality as they do.  I'd recommend them to anyone who wants to  enjoy intelligent quality entertainment - no four letter words and removing of clothes in 'All Creatures Great and Small'",1171065600,3,577,4.528846153846154
8056534,3,B0009298NO,"I thought episodes about Caleb would be enjoyable since he was such an interesting character, with his pet badger who went on his rounds with him, and his many pets and rescue animals. But this Caleb has nary a pet, let alone a badger. This Caleb spends most of his off time getting drunk or recovering from getting drunk. I do not recall the book Caleb drinking but I suppose the producers thought you couldn't go wrong with boozers -- since Tristan has the same problem when he isn't chasing females. Caleb's lady appears in a couple of episodes but she's more interested in cleaning house than animals. It's sad that this show never or seldom seems to capture the essence of the novels; the beauty of the Yorkshire landscape, the strength, generosity, and fortitude of the farmers, the joy of Life, and the remarkable love for the animals. The farmers are fat and often nasty. The animals are just animals with little personality. Siegfried is a plump man in his fifties, whereas the original Siegfried was only eight years older than Heriot. So, you have to take this series in stride and accept it as an alternate universe and you will be okay.",1526428800,,1149,4.637254901960785

8056540,3,B0009298NO,"I love the original series, which I've re-watched numerous times, but apparently the writers tried to reprise it as a comedy starring the tiresome and unfunny ""antics"" of the Tristan character.  Seasons 5, 6 and 7 have a few memorable episodes (especially Season 6 when Tristan is away TB testing cows in Ireland) but overall the animals and James's character have become almost incidental and I'll be doing a lot of fast-forwarding if I ever watch these again.",1461024000,,461,4.910256410256411
