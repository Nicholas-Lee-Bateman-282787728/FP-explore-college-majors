The performances were not too good but, did demonstrate how to put the moves together.  I wish that they did a better job on editing.",1315353600,,251,4.081632653061225
8207630,3,B000T2OX2A,"This is a VERY beginner video. I bought this as an intermediate-level cabaret dancer who wanted to learn some tribal.  This video is too basic.

For me, what makes a beautiful dancer is the use of hands and arms.  Any video can teach hip circles and figure 8's, which are the same in tribal or cabaret dancing.  What makes Tribal Fusion unique is the distinctive hand and arm flourishes.  I ordered this video thinking that ""technical foundation"" should address this.  Nope.  Only some wrist circles and floralias were taught, but it was never explained how to do this so that they look natural and not like you're just doing circles over and over.

The other thing I wanted from this video was: how do two dancers work together to improvise?  They show two ""performances"" with both dancers/teachers, but it is not clear how they cue each other to do the next movement.  One leads and sometimes it takes a few seconds for the other to follow.  It doesn't look good, nevermind the fact that they stand in one place and it's pretty boring.  On the second ""performance"" the dancers stand next to each other doing completely different moves, which looks pretty weird.  A better name for this section would be ""practice"" because it is not ""performance"" caliber dancing.

The movements taught on this video:
basic posture
hip snaps
hip twists up and down
horizontal hip twist shimmy
hip slide
flat Turkish circle
hip figure 8 and arc
hip circle
ribcage slide, pop, and circle
shoulder shimmy
snake arms
head slide and circle
spin
body wave.

So, if you know these moves already, you proably won't learn much from this video, unless you don't have a teacher and really need some refresher.

I want to be encouraging of all dancers' efforts to produce and sell quality instructional videos to further our art form, so I will say that the instruction is good, especially the part on keeping the hip slides level.",1262304000,,1903,4.721212121212122
8207631,2,B000T2OX2A,"A very, very basic DVD.  For the beginner dancer only.  Very well explained in a slow step by step manner.",1216339200,,106,4.25
8207632,3,B000T2OX2A,I agree with another reviewer that this dvd was way overpriced for the quality of what you get. I was bored out of my mind and switched it off and went back to a more professional DVD I had purchased (Fat Chance). I like the idea of what they are trying to do but for the love of what you do... show it some respect and pay money for professionals to shoot and edit it for you.,1212883200,,377,3.909090909090909
8207633,5,B000T2OX2A,"Excellent Technical DVD - All the infromation and instruction that you need to get started with Tribal Style Bellydance.  Well worth the $$.

Although not heavy on cinematography it breaks each step down into easy to understand instructions.  The lively performances at the end include the steps and combos learned in the DVD.

Highly recommended.",1195344000,2,347,5.254545454545455
8207634,5,B000T2OX2A,"This DVD is EXCELLENT for beginners.  Each move is broken down step by step with easy to follow instructions.  All the moves are performed infront of a mirror giving the viewer a front and a back view of each step.

Although it is a bit more expensive than other mass production BellyDance DVD's it is a must for any serious beginner.  Unlike other bellydance DVD's I own this one puts the emphasis on learning each move correctly not on camera angles and special effects.

If you are looking for a DVD that is entertaining with lots of flash and fluff then look elsewhere.  If you want to learn Tribal style Belly Dance than BUY THIS DVD!",1195344000,,639,4.4655172413793105
8207635,2,B000T2OX2A,"Even if this video was a good one, it costs three times what it should, given the fact that there are fabulous videos out there on tribal fusion. I own 15 of them (of 91 belly dance videos) and this immediately sticks out like a sore thumb for its poor quality.

Narah and Jala may well be wonderful dancers, but teaching basic isolations on a video that has less-than-desirable picture quality and without giving you anything additional, makes this very poor value for money. The three ""combinations"" are nowhere near the combinations you'd find on other videos. They're just an isolation or two done together, whereas on some of the tribal videos available, the combinations are a whole set of choreographed moves, usually making up an entire danceable choreography.

Overall, this is one of the poorest deals I've ever got on a belly dance video.",1193011200,4,849,4.848275862068966
8207636,2,B000T2OX2A,"This is a basic instructional belly dance dvd.  They show all of the basic moves well, however, it's way overpriced.  The best tribal/ATS bellydance dvd's are fat chance belly dance's instructional series.  They are the same price and you can find em cheaper.  I would also suggest something from the World Dance NY series. Just as good if not better and 1/4th the price.",1190246400,4,371,4.75
