Amazon deals with the rare movie site that has this title listed as ""Dracula and Son"", so I don't under stand just why they don't carry this very rare title. The copy that I bought has great color, great audio, and great picture quality from a very good print of the film that they transferred. I laughed very hard, during ""Dracula and Son"". It is a very entertaining movie and a good send off for Christopher Lee's Count Dracula. Ask Amazon to start carrying this title. I believe that they will sell a lot of copies, because there are a lot of fans that are looking for this movie, making it a good business decision!",1483142400,,726,4.425373134328358
7884435,5,6305081883,"The last Dracula film by Chris Lee may seem like a bad film on first glance, but deep down it's one of the best rare cult films. Along with Nosferatu in Venice this is a cult film that manages to feel more like a normal film rather than a crazy experience. The other film is a bit strange but this one is a smart,witty and genuinely funny. It looks into pedestrian vampire situations such as running away from sunlight and buying a coffin. It also borders on social satire parodying the treatment of immigrants and the importance put on advertisement when it comes to common health products such as toothpaste. Animal lovers beware there are two scenes that imply some harm. It has influenced many other more well known Drac parodies such as Love at First Bite and Dead and Loving it. Christopher Lee fares well as Dracula, getting more lines than usual and (In the version dubbed by him) gives them in a amazingly sinister performance, which only kicks up the funnyness because we realize that for him those are totally normal occurences. Bernard Menez gives a hokey but likeable performance as Ferdinand which actually makes you laugh. One of his friends looks like Richard Pryor but acts better. The cartoon at the begginining is entertaining if not stilted in it's movement. The 2nd act may seem slow in your first viewing but after you give it a chance you'll like it more. It still was a 4 star movie for me since the first viewing but now I give it 5 stars. It is a classic worth realesing on DVD. Come on Anchor Bay, Starz or Shout Factory release Dracula: The rare european collection with this, Dracula: The Big Scare(Which I haven't seen) and Nosferatu in Venice.",1357344000,,1674,4.60200668896321
