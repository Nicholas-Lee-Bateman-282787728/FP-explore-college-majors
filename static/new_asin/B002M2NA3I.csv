8373412,5,B002M2NA3I,"This is a great dvd! But It could be better. Cause it wasn't included all TV Specials released in Japan, like:
20 Nov News Centre 9:00 Japan
22 Nov 11PM Japan
22 Nov Music Fair Japan
23 Nov The Best 10 Japan
24 Nov Ginza Now Japan
Unfortunatelly all those are out of this dvd. The Music Fair was great in scenary and beauty. The image used on the ""The Winner Takes it All"" dvd cover was extracted of that TV Special. All could be add on that extra disc of Deluxe Edition...
But still yes its a great dvd and you must have it! In this dvd we see just only:
25 Nov ABBA Special Japan
17-26 Nov ABBA in Japan Japan
Great TV Specials.",1263513600,,630,4.007936507936508
