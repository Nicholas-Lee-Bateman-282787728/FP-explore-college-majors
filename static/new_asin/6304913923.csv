8268253,5,6304913923,"I MUST buy this one. I rented it tonightr based on this site and the reviews here and being a huge fan of the director, I fell in love with this movie. The story is twisting, turning and amazing. The cast is good, the effects (by a HUGE number of effects people!!!) were great and the action never stops.
The story is laid out in other reviews and all I have to add is that I am glad they left a bunch of details out of I would be very upset.  There is one part where the hero becomes suicidal that peaks with one of the greatest and most disturbing sucker-punches in all horror. I am not blowing smoke here people (I DON""T even smoke anyway!) the scene has that much power. There are other equally shocking parts, each handled with skill and know-how by a very under rated group of people.
This movie only affirms my belief that Todd Sheets is the best director in the low budget field.  Sure, I didn't care for the real early ones that I bought(I figure that everyone starts someplace), but this director has gotten better on each movie I have seen since I bought Moonchild and shows a real eye for style, and visual flair.  This is the best straight to video movie I may have ever got. Now I have to buy it!",982368000,,1210,4.206896551724138
