2568566,5,B000FILXEY,"I bought this video to complete this series. Always enjoy the stories and love to collect the series. My daughter loves to watch more than 1 time. Although I want to see more of Sarah Stanley, but the story itself is beautiful and the location, Price Edward Island, is a breathtaking.",1274832000,,284,4.588235294117647
2568567,5,B000FILXEY,"Thoroughly pleased with quality of product and condition of shipping packaging.  Content of movies are heart-warming, humorous,and a bit of clean romance.  Family friendly.  Thumbs up!",1264636800,,184,6.0
2568568,4,B000FILXEY,"I just finished watching all the episodes on this set. The one thing I did not expect was something I had never seen: 2-sided DVDs. They are silver on both sides and have the disc and side number around the center in small print. There are two episodes per side, and multiple discs. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I expected, since there is only one episode featuring Felicity and Gus's story. As a fan of the series, I did enjoy most of the episodes very much and learned more about some of the newer characters included later in the series. It is all very good quality entertainment and very clean for all of the family to enjoy.",1233792000,,635,4.3
2568569,5,B000FILXEY,"This is an incredible family television series that is timeless in nature and appeals to all ages.  My children watched it growing up, and now as young adults are a thrilled as I am to watch it all over again.  There is humor and drama with wonderful story lines that will never loose thier context regardless of the era.  If you are looking for wholesome, all family entertainment it doesn't get better than this.  Cindy",1224806400,,421,4.573333333333333
2568570,5,B000FILXEY,"I love ""Road to Avonlea""!!  It is a great family series that teaches good values.  I own all six and plan to get the seventh season as well.  It is every bit as fun and romantic as Anne of Green Gables with a flair of it's own.  The series will cause you to laugh, cry, and dream with the characters.  There are not many classy, uplifting shows like this any more.  The whole series is definitely my all time favorite of any series or movie available.",1222732800,,451,4.186046511627907
2568571,5,B000FILXEY,As great as Seasons 1-5. I loved every minute of it. Well worth the expensive price.,1190678400,,84,4.3125
2568572,4,B000FILXEY,"Season 6 of ""Avonlea"" as we always knew it by in the US is not quite as excellent as its pervious seasons, but is still worth the purchase none the less. The season begins with one of the best episodes of the series, ""The Return of Gus Pike."" This episode finally resovles the story arc between Gus Pike, Captain Crane, Abe Pike, and Gus's Mother. In this episode we finally find out why exactly Gus ended up a orphan without a family, and what really happened to his mother Eliza. Janet-Laine Green does a amazing job of portraying Gus's mother and even somewhat resembles him.

The other episodes in this season are kind all over the place. Focusing on many of the different characters. Sara appears in only one episode, and it is basically the big goodbye for Sarah Polley who had, had her fill of the series. In this episode Sara must decide rather she is going to follow her own dreams or those of her Aunt Hetty or Nanny Louisa. The episode also brings back Arthur Pettibone who returns. Definately one of my favorite episodes of the series.

In this season the character of Cecily is replaced by actress Molly Atkinson. Atkinson brings new life and depth to the character that the previous actress was not able to. I'm not saying the prior actress was bad or anything, but Atkinson brings Cecily more in to adulthood. The third episode in the season is called ""Christmas in June,"" and is probably one of the best stand alone stories of the series.

Also during this season, the character of Rachel Lynde suffers two seperate strokes. She must leave her beloved Avonlea and Green Gables and that leaves Hetty King to raise Davey and Dora Keith. It almost seems at this point that the writers were just trying to find something for the very talented Jackie Burroughs to do.

There are several good episodes and several ones that a individual could probably do without. We see less of Sara (again only in one episode), Felicity, and Gus(also only in one), but more of Felix, Hetty, Davey, Dora, Izzy, and Green Gables alum Miss Stacey. Definately a enjoyable season at the very least!",1188000000,12,2088,4.619946091644205
2568573,5,B000FILXEY,THAT IS A GRAT MOVIE YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ALL OF IT.,1179100800,,52,3.076923076923077
2568574,5,B000FILXEY,"Season-six weakens in episode consistency compared to earlier seasons. Out of 13-espisodes, 8 are pleasant, 2 break believability without the real Cecily, 2 are good, and 1 is excellent. The pleasant stories of Avonlea do continue. The episode, ""A Fox Tale"", where Felix and Izzy start a business, is excellent with bantering between Felicity and ""that annoying boy"" Nat Lester.

Sarah appears in one episode.

A different actress plays Cecily, appearing and starring in two episodes. The original actress, in spite of the small part, created a likeable and memorable Cecily with a distinct personality; that she could not be replaced without notice. The two emotional Cecily episodes depend on the audience remembering and liking the original Cecily, but then switch someone else as Cecily. Who's idea was that? If they were unable to sign the original actress for another season after flowers and gifts, they would have done better to leave Cecily out entirely.

This season has less scenic outdoor photography that was so appealing.

The touted ""Behind-the-scenes"" is only a ""preview"" of this DVD that you have already bought, and the producer saying it is a nice season.

The writers of my favorite episodes of the early seasons, Heather Conkie, Suzette Couture, and Hart Hanson are missing this season.

These disappointments should be forgiven, in light of this wonderful series. It really is a great series.

You should start with the first season; as seasons 1-5 are best. Charming children and adults get into fun predicaments. If you liked ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""Anne of Green Gables""; you will like this. The realistic, likeable, characters are people that I would like to know. Avonlea is a place that I would like to visit, with beautiful countryside, farm, horses, period costumes and sets, women in pretty dresses, charm, some humor, interesting activities, and a lively pace.

Mr. Sullivan spared no expense creating fun escapades.",1175731200,9,1958,5.1545741324921135

2568585,5,B000FILXEY,"Road to Avonlea is my absolute favorite series. The stories at times can be a bit far fetched but the simple lives that the characters live makes me yearn for a more simple life! This is one show I don't have to worry about my daughter being in the room when I'm watching, there is now swearing, no vulagrity; it's truely a wholesome show the entire family can enjoy. The only thing I dislike is that it ended!",1368403200,2,410,4.269230769230769
2568586,5,B000FILXEY,"My husband introduced me to Anne of Green Gables after we were married...his sisters made him watch it over and over growing up. I loved it! I then remembered my Grandma watching a show called Avonlea when I was a kid, I never sat down and watched it with her...but after seeing the Anne movies I had to give them a try. When I saw how much they were I decided to rent some first. We rented season 1 and 2 and my kids (2, 4, and 6 at the time) and I loved them! I love all the RTA seasons even more than Little House. We own all but one of the seasons now...but we will get it next month! I watch these over and over with my kids, my five year old son even loves them. He thinks Felix and Gus are so cool! I would say from a conservative Christian perspective that there were a few episodes (out of all the seasons combined not out of each one) that I won't show my young children until they are older. I just put a sticky note on the outside of the case to remind myself which one I don't want them to watch. Some episodes in this series the children are quite naughty, but it makes for good discussions with my children afterwards. Sometimes Amazon's price is good...sometimes not. Season 1,4, and 6 I bought from Amazon but Season 3 and 5 I found a better deal on ebay.. I bought the HD ones and mine are great quality...I hate the case though, I put mine into clear DVD cases of my own because I felt like I was going to scratch them taking them in and out of what they came in. These are the cases I use http://www.amazon.com/Memorex-Slim-Video-Storage-Cases/dp/B0001MKU48/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=WMJ1V2M7LYW&coliid=I2ZC05DAKRKRW4",1367971200,2,1649,4.4635761589403975

2568592,5,B000FILXEY,This season has many good episodes that follow the lives of the King children who are growing up. I can watch this with my family and enjoy good wholesome entertainment. It has the right mix of drama and comedy.,1300579200,,211,4.435897435897436
2568593,5,B000FILXEY,"In the Sixth Season of RTA, we do not get to see much of familiar characters Sarah Stanley and Gus Pike, but the series manages to move along with the other supporting cast. Gus Pike's past is finally revealed in this season, and Sarah Stanley is all grown-up and making her own decisions regarding her future which also takes her away from Avonlea. Felicity King tries medical school, makes a success of her first year, but a personal tragedy drives her away from medicine.

There is a lot of focus on Davey Keith this season, a plot line I did not personally care for. Despite sympathizing with his plight as an orphan, I would rather have seen more focus on some of the other beloved characters such as Janet, Alec, and Hetty. I wonder if the focus on the younger characters was an attempt at trying to get a couple of more seasons in the series by following these characters as they grew up. Sadly, the appeal of the first batch of youngsters in the earlier seasons of RTA (focusing on Sarah Stanley, Felicity King, Felix King, and Gus Pike) could not be replicated with Dora, Davey, and Izzy.

The Return of Gus Pike - Felicity King struggles as the only female student in medical school, then spots her old love, Gus Pike in Halifax. The pair meet a strange woman who appears to recognize Gus' ruby ring and the name Ezekiel Crane. This prompts Gus to take the woman, Eliza back to Avonlea, in a bid to discover the truth about his past. A very poignant episode.

Lonely Hearts - Avonlea has its first annual bachelor auction with hilarious results.

Christmas in June - back at the sanatorium, Cecily gets into trouble after befriending a rascal named Louie. Note: There is a casting change - the actress that played Cecily in past seasons of RTA, i.e. Harmony Cramp is replaced by Molly Atkinson who gives a more assertive interpretation of Cecily which is apt considering all that her character has been through after her bout with TB.

Fools and Kings - with Felicity away at medical school and Daniel away on a trip, Janet finds herself at a loss as to what to do and decides to work at home for ACME company; Alex plans to induct Felix into the Knights of P.E.I.; Hetty and the Daughters of the Dominion take on their rivals, the Knights of P.E.I.

Comings and Goings - Sarah Stanley returns to Avonlea after six months, accompanied by nanny Louisa. Both Hetty and Louisa bicker (as usual) over Sarah's future, but Sarah has her own plans. Will they stop long enough to listen?

The Trouble with Davey - Rachel Lynde has her hands full caring for twins Davey and Dora, and when she suffers a stroke, Hetty King steps in to help. Rachel's son takes her back to live with him, and Hetty is left to care for the twins, finding Davey a handful.

Great Expectations -  Davey Keith gets into trouble (as usual), and Hetty tries to teach him the value of school by using reverse psychology (sending him to work at the cannery). The plan backfires when Jasper Dale sympathizes with Davey's plight and acts as his mentor. It's funny how Jasper always seems to be inventing things ahead of his time but never receives the recognition or fame for it (in this episode he invents the vacuum cleaner, and Hetty gets to experience its `merits' firsthand, lol).

A Fox Tale - Felix and Izzy go into business together, starting a fox farm. Their friendship is threatened when Felix decides to take someone else as his partner because of financial constraints.

The More Things Change - Clive Pettibone and Muriel Stacey finally tie the knot.

Home is Where the Heart Is - Rachel Lynde suffers a severe stroke, and Hetty nurses her back to health. Rachel loses her ability to speak, but true to her indomitable spirit, refuses to give up.

What a Tangled Web We Weave - the White Sands hosts a grand society wedding but turns out that both the bride and groom may not come from such exalted backgrounds after all; Felix fails his English exam and may not graduate. His self-esteem takes a battering, causing him to consider leaving Avonlea.

A Time to Every Purpose - Felicity misses the registration deadline for second-year medical school and is stuck in Avonlea. Dr. Snow employs her as his assistant but she finds his approach to medicine rather old-fashioned. Felicity's childhood friend Colleen is expecting but when the delivery goes terribly awry, Felicity has doubts about her future in medicine.

Homecoming - Cecily returns home after her bout in the sanatorium but chafes under the strict supervision of her parents and family, yearning for freedom and to be treated as normal. The townsfolk's prejudice does not help either. The telephone exchange comes to Avonlea and Felicity receives some tragic news.

Final verdict - still a fun season, but missing the magic of the earlier seasons.",1289692800,3,4794,4.669039145907473

8123411,5,B000FILXEY,"My wife and I got hooked on ""Avonlea"" during its initial run on The Disney Channel in the early 1990's. As I recall we were both very pleased to find a show devoid of all of the double entendre and sexual innuendo that was becoming so prevalant on prime time television in those days. Well here we are nearly two decades later and network and cable TV continues to sink to new lows. My wife and I simply don't watch it anymore. As an alternative we have built our own library of classic motion pictures and quality television shows.  About a year or so ago we purchased all seven seasons of Kevin Sullivan's phenomenal Canadian TV series ""Road To Avonlea"".  These are not cheap but I must tell you they are worth every penny. To our way of thinking ""Road to Avonlea"" is the finest television series ever created.  We have just concluded viewing the sixth season of the series for the second time. Much to our delight we found ""Avonlea: The Complete Sixth Season"" to be every bit as entertaining as the first five. This is no small feat!

As always the photography is nothing short of spectacular and the writing superb.  We see less of series regulars Felicity King and Olivia Dale and more of White Sands Hotel owner Simon Tremayne and general store owner Muriel Stacy.  Over the course of the season Muriel ties the knot with Clive Pettibone and Rachel Lynde suffers a debilitating stroke.  It constantly amazes me how much I have come to care about so many of these characters.  As far as I am concerned  ""Road to Avonlea: Season 6"" is family entertainment at its absolute best.  Highly recommended!",1435190400,2,1602,4.56993006993007
