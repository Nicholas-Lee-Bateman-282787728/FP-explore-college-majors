8187877,5,B00005LOM0,"This cassette contains all the videos that MuchMusic and MTV mercilessly banned.  Too bad it's not available in DVD format, but still well worth it to be able to see the rich, detailed visuals that work quite well with the dark lyrics.  Well worth buying, to be watched over and over again.  When some newbies start yapping their mouths off about NIN or Marilyn Manson, you can pop this in your VCR and show them who inspired them to become musicians.",995846400,,451,4.54320987654321
