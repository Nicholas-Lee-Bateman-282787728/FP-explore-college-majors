4147811,4,B003L77GJM,"I do enjoy reading how some people are calling this the ""worst season ever"" yet season one and two were so bland and unfunny that I could barely see the show continuing to air...yet you have people saying that those were SO MUCH BETTER then this season, can anyone explain that to me please? Don't listen to these stupid reviews, they're obviously from people who only seen season five and assumed the other seasons were just like that and when the show goes back to a more season 3 format everyone starts freaking out. If anything season five wasn't that funny either, just everyone remembers the last couple and that is their impression of the season. It's not that the show changed as much as the fans, this season had overall better episodes then last season so when this comes out it would suit you to purchase this season which is being reviewed only by crazed season five fans...and probably 12 yr olds. To all those who ""hate"" this season go and watch seasons one and two and count how many times you laugh over both, it will be very slim TRUST ME (plus half those who negatively reviewed this season will be the first to buy it and regret writing those reviews when they take a better look at it)",1292112000,,1205,4.457013574660634
4147812,5,B003L77GJM,"Please do yourself a favor and don't pay attention to any of these people who are suddenly hating on this show.  Season 6 has been classic from the start, with some episodes being the best the series has ever been.  It's so funny to see all the negative reviews claiming that Seasons 1-5 were wonderful, yet when Season 5 was airing, all anyone could talk about was how the show was getting too outlandish and straying from it's roots.  Basically, decide for yourself and don't let all the online negativity nerds make you miss out on the greatest television series since Arrested Development.",1291766400,2,593,4.737864077669903
4147813,2,B003L77GJM,"I cannot recommend the first five seasons of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia more. They are just the best of the best when it comes to a comedic television series. This season, however, is flat and painfully unfunny. I don't know if the cast is too involved in side projects, if there are new writers, if the first five were writen closer together, or what the case may be, but it is a shell of what it was. The dialogue and jokes are basically reused from the past five seasons and the storylines, although funny on paper, are flat and ""by-the-number"" in Always Sunny standards. Please come back next season, because Season 6 is a total, and consistant, pass.",1291507200,12,662,4.571428571428571
4147814,2,B003L77GJM,"I love the show but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  This season has been disappointing.
""Who Got Dee Pregnant?"" was hilarious maybe a a top ten episode.  Buts that was the high point of this season.

I'll be back next year if they are but this season has been a let down.",1290816000,9,290,4.052631578947368
4147815,2,B003L77GJM,"I too am an avid fan of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and own the first 5 seasons on DVD and I couldn't be more disappointed with Season 6 so far.  The material seems forced, and many of the times I wonder if Rob, Charlie and Glenn even find the material funny or are they just pumping out another season.  I couldn't help but wonder if Kaitlin Olson's (Dee Reynolds) pregnancy had something to do with the decline of the show as Rob McElhenney (Mac, and Kaitlin's husband) and Kaitlin are preparing to be parents.  Soon both Rob and Kaitlin will be dedicated to raising a newborn, which makes things tricky for Season 7 and the quality may further decline simply because the baby of these two will, and most certainly should, be the priority.

Regardless I think I can safely rate season 6 with two stars at this point since 10 of the episodes have aired, and many have been a comedic miss making for a departure from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia's uncanny comedic consistency.  I will still buy season 6 as I think many fans of the series should since every episode has some moments now again and old character favorite's make their appearance (Who Got Dee Pregnant?), and new potential classics are introduced (Charlie's Uncle in Dennis Gets Divorced).",1290038400,20,1264,4.650224215246637
4147816,5,B003L77GJM,"Contrary to other reviews, I'm still loving this series. I'll admit, the first two episodes weren't the best (though they still had very funny parts - still laugh thinking about Mac's gag reflex), and I just don't know where the whole pregnancy thing is going, but the show is still a blast. Who Got Dee Pregnant was one of the best episodes yet, eps 8 & 9 were classic for Charlie, and as fans how can you people not be in love with Lethal Weapon 5? White Trash was pretty fantatstic so far too. All in all not the best season, but I'm still in love, and this is still the best show on television. I'm confident this season will end in fantastic fashion and have no issues giving this a five star rating with what I've seen so far.",1289692800,19,732,4.235714285714286

4147818,4,B003L77GJM,"i'm ashamed to admit i gave this 2 stars at first. but after watching this season a second time, i have to say it really wasn't as bad as i thought. i don't think it's as great as the previous seasons, but it's still a hilarious show with some definite funny moments. i hope they continue to include audio commentary and other bonus material in the dvd release. and i'm looking forward to season 7.",1289001600,2,398,4.32
4147819,2,B003L77GJM,"I am a huge fan and love the first five seasons, but come on season six has been horrible.....absolute garbage. Remember ""Who Pooped The Bed"" now try and think of an episode from season 6, big difference huh??",1288828800,12,209,4.526315789473684
4147820,5,B003L77GJM,"For fans of ""It's Always Sunny"" there is nothing more enjoyable than watching Mac and Charlie have an adventure. In this weeks episode, it's on ice. Can they do it? Can Mac and Charlie finally have their day in the sun by winning the big contest?

4149572,5,B003L77GJM,"This is perhaps the funniest episode of this entire series, mostly because it contains Mac & Dennis' ""Lethal Weapon 5"" short. I laughed my ass off through most of this episode. I think this particular episode strikes a chord, because it reminds me of some of the things I've filmed. The Charlie mannequin getting kicked out of a window and run over by a UPS truck? That sort of cheap special effects reminds me of when me and my friends filmed/acted a French short story in which a boy was shot;  we used fireworks as squibs under water balloons filled with homemade fake blood... and the result was spectacularly campy and hilarious. Anyway, ""Dee Reynolds: Shaping America's Youth"" is easily the best episode of the season. I can't believe this show has been around for 9 seasons, and I hope they keep going.

FYI: Dennis makes a much better Riggs, and Mac does a much better Murtaugh (though blackface was a regrettable choice)",1406678400,2,929,4.693251533742331

The only people I would not recommend this season to are the ones just now getting into the show. Season 6 on blu ray is crazy cheap on Amazon right now at just over $11, so some might be tempted to start the show with season 6. I think you have to love the show and the characters in order to really enjoy season 6.

Best of season 6: ""The Gang Buys a Boat""

Worst of season 6: ""Dee Reynolds: Shaping America's Youth"" (but it was nice to see Dave Foley)",1396915200,,703,3.8680555555555554

4149901,1,B003L77GJM,"Man oh man did this season suck, I can only remember a handful of funny moments, in fact I think I'll list them now:

-the Implication
-the Who Got Dee Pregnant episode
-Frank's sex scene in Lethal Weapon 5
-Charlie talking about beating up Dee's baby (which was only funny because of the bloopers)

and that's it. The whole season is a bunch of misses that are just embarrasing to watch, it's painfully obvious the original crew didn't write these episodes and instead it was handled by 'professional writers'. So the characters aren't really themselves this season, it's more of the characters trying to play themselves (that sentence made more sense in my head) and it is awfully predictable. ""Oh boy, here goes Charlie again, isn't he sooo craaazy being a school janitor??"". Ugh.

Also it's always sunny's blatant product placement is more obvious here, the whole Dennis gets Divorced episode might as well take place in a subway, because I only really remember that you can get a sweet breakfast at subway. Their coors lights are omnipotentally present as well, always facing the camera and reminding you that if you want to be cool like the gang, you better drink the beer they drink.

I remember episodes like Mac's big break, Mac & Charlie: White Trash, and The gang gets a new member, and can't recall a single joke from the whole thing. It's just the characters going through the motions, and they look as bored as I feel watching this season. The whole second half of ""the gang buys a boat"" where it shows Frank, Dee, and Charlie on the boat, where was the humor? Instead it felt like some stupid 'bonding' moment, and I'm supposed to lap it up thinking ""that's my favorite gang, doing what they do best"", no. Maybe moments like when everyone is smiling at Dee's baby works for the die hard fans who are just happy to see their favorite characters again but when they stand around acting sappy I get bored, fast. Little Seventh Heaven moments like those do not fit with this show at all.

See the reason why I liked IASIP in the first place was in the earlier episodes the gang was always scheming to screw each other over, episodes like The Gang Runs for Office or The Gang Dances Their Asses Off showcase this well, and it was entertaining to see who'll come out on top in the end and how, but in the new episodes they're just a band of misfits being awkward in the real world, talk about lazy writing. It's such a bummer that the same show that had the really well written Mac's Banging Dennis' Mom episode to The Gang Get's Stranded in the Woods.

Lastly IASIP had some fads catch on, such as Greenman or Dayman, but here it's just painful watching them try to force it. In the single aforementioned 'good' episode I think the dialogue goes like this verbadum: ""I browned out that night"" ""Wait browned out, what's that?"" ""Well it's sort of like a black out but not as much"" ""Wow I'm going to have to add that to my vocabulary from now on and constantly use it"" (they never did after that episode thankfully) ""So anyways I was browning out that night *wink*"". Oh and on a totally different subject you can order your awesome ""Browned Out"" shirt from the offical store!",1335312000,2,3182,4.544502617801047

4149980,5,B003L77GJM,"I read reviews of fans who think season six wasn't as good as others seasons, I couldn't help shaking my head while reading some reviews, so I had to express my opinion. Im not a big fan of scripted Comedy so its rare I find one that I quote, some episodes sticks in my head days after watching. Always Sunny isn't for the easily offended, so If you think Reba or Friends is the ""End All"" in the World of TV Comedy's this might not be your cup of tea. I love the absurdity of the characters, conversations, situations from the Gang (Mac, Dennis, Charlie, Dee and Frank) to all the recurring characters, Ive laughed so hard some times my stomach hurts.

Now at least 6 episodes in season six Ill watch over and over again, the rest kept me smiling. Always Sunny at its worst is better than 95% of so called funny sitcoms on TV today, some thing as simple as Danny Devito's facial expression as Frank makes me laugh in the moment. Too the Writers of Always Sunny Id love to see whole episodes dedicated to the recurring characters, start with Gail The Snail and Margaret McPoyle ""characters so odd you just laugh looking at them"".

Too the fans, Always Sunny has set the bar so high in unfiltered, absurd, offensive Comedy its hard to live up to the classic episode over the years but there is plenty to appreciate in season six, just watch Who Got Dee Pregnant and Dee Gives Birth ""please don't throw me in the trash"", to remind you this show hasn't lost a step.

4149992,4,B003L77GJM,"Alright everyone, this is my first review for the site, so be gentle with me haha.
Season 6 is a long awaited dvd (at least in my books) that while it has rocky moments, scenes like the Gangs long rumored Lethal Weapon 5 really redeem the seasons slower points, and the Extras really shines through when it comes to commentary, deleted scenes and a blooper reel. Alot of you that watched it on TV may be quick to point out that the Gang seems to be much less aggressive this time around, but i guarantee you that they one again start kicking each other when their down at full steam about halfway through the season. BIG PLUS FOR THIS SEASON: This season has more fan service than in any show ive seen in recent memory. Im talking about bringing up old running jokes (Macs baseball star obsession, Cricket, Carmen the Tranny, & MORE!) and finally brings them to fruition, which, especially in the final two episodes of the season, Cement this as an addition to any hardcore Sunny fan, but is more or less going to be hit or miss with consumers or the uninitiated.

Pros: Great Humor, Fan Service, Lethal Weapon 5 Directors cut & commentary

Cons: Too slow and ""Nice"" compared to earlier seasons, Much humor is lost on old references and jokes that many people won't catch.",1316304000,,1272,4.526086956521739
4149993,5,B003L77GJM,"Don't miss this season, it has some truly classic episodes.  The weakest one is the first episode but it is still funny none the less. All of the others totally redeem the slow start, and If you are a fan of the series, you will love it because it's full of laugh out loud moments just like the other seasons.  I have the dvd version and it looks great.  I would have gotten the blu ray but I like watching it with friends and they don't have blu ray players yet.",1316131200,,463,4.065934065934066
4149994,3,B003L77GJM,"It seems I got into this show at exactly the wrong time. I caught reruns on TV during Summer 2010 and was hooked by halfway through the first episode, so I immediately purchased the Sunny Six Pack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia-Seasons-1-5-Christmas-Special/dp/B003X27I8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Seasons 1-5 + Christmas Special</a>) and was blown away. I couldn't believe the show started out so strong, then seemed only to get better throughout Season 2 after the addition of DeVito, with consistently hysterical episodes all the way through Season 5.

Then came Season 6. And something changed, in a big way. As several have already suggested, logic dictates that it probably had something to do with Rob and Kaitlin's new addition to their family. Honestly, my big issue with this season was not so much the overuse of the pregnancy as a gag in the show. Rather, the overall tone and pace of the dialog and character interaction just feels... ""off."" Big time.

What drew me into the show originally was their ability to stuff a mind-boggling number of asinine, off-the-wall situations and debacles into 22 minutes. Aside from perhaps the ""White Trash"" pool episode and one or two others, that just doesn't happen this season. The real low points have to be ""The Gang Gets a New Member"" and ""The Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods,"" both of which almost embarrass me, as a fan. I can count the number of times I laughed through each of those on one hand. Can you say phoned-in?

While not completely awful, this season is quite clearly a (white) stain on the legacy earlier seasons had established; I doubt they won many new converts among folks who tuned in for the first time last year. Whereas shocking gags and references to long-running jokes used to be the icing on the cake, it felt like the writers relied almost entirely on such novelties to carry most episodes in S6. If you're a Sunny newbie, definitely start from the beginning and not here; if you're a fan who happened to miss last season and now want to catch up, I'd advise downloading a couple episodes before forking over for the full DVD set.",1316131200,15,2222,5.065573770491803
4149995,5,B003L77GJM,"Show was not the best season, but it is still one of the funniest things on TV. Plus the blu/dvd is packed with a lot of great extras! Easily worth $24.99",1315785600,2,154,4.0
4149996,5,B003L77GJM,"I respect all of the reviews that have been written thus far regarding Season 6 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  However, I must say that the authors of these reviews are blatantly wrong.  Well, maybe not wrong, but definitely misguided.

After John Quincy Adams painted the Sistine Chapel, I bet he got the same flack from his supposed friends and colleagues when he painted something else.

""Oh, I don't know, John.  I mean, it's good, but it's no Sistine Chapel.""

What is he supposed to do?  Certainly everything can't live up to the standards of a masterpiece.  Otherwise, there would be no masterpieces.  There would just be John Quincy Adams paintings.

I guess what I'm eloquently saying is that if your perception of a particular season is vastly superior to another, it doesn't mean that the ""lesser"" season is bad.  It doesn't even mean that it's average.  It is just different.  The point is that it's still a very clever, hysterical show with a mean streak that we all love--or--if you're not yet familiar with the show, will come to love.

The season by itself is GREAT.  Buy it.  If you don't buy it, it means that you're wicked dumb.  However, only buy it if you actually have the money.  Don't buy it and then regret it when they shut off your water or whatever.  That'd be a mistake.  Just buy it if you can afford it.

Thanks for reading.  I hope that I cleared up the wrongfully abysmal rating that this season has garnered.",1315526400,2,1450,4.58203125

4149998,5,B003L77GJM,"Look: I think that Always Sunny has generally been excellent for its entire run. Feel free to malign me for it in the comments. Now:

The first two episodes of this season were a disappointment. (Yes, I realize the irony.) However, for the rest of the season, The Gang's debauched actions were funny and entertaining. Whether buying a boat, investigating a pregnancy, debating the relative merits of blackface or getting stranded in the woods, Dennis, Dee, Mac, Charlie and Frank continued their over-the-top spree of depraved antics in the usual fashion. If you liked their adventures previously, watch. If not- why not? (Kidding.)
Best episode: ""Who Got Dee Pregnant?""
Grade: 4.75/5",1313107200,,684,5.162162162162162
4149999,3,B003L77GJM,"Until this season ""Sunny"" has gotten progressively better each year -- finally hitting its apex with the amazing Season 5. Season 6, however, seemed to deviate from this momentum and proved to be generally uneven.

As some other reviewers have noted, only two episodes were actually written by members of the main cast (""The Gang Buys a Boat"" and ""Who Got Dee Pregnant?"") which fittingly are two of the season's strongest episodes. This fact points to probably the most glaring problem with Season 6 -- it has great moments, just fewer solid complete episodes than seasons past.

Sure ""the implication,"" ""Lethal Weapon 5"" and Mac calling everyone a ""Jabroni"" will easily enter the canon of great and memorable Sunny moments, however episodes like ""Mac and Charlie: White Trash"" hardly hold up against their catalog of better written episodes.

Maybe it was too many side projects, maybe it was working around Kaitlin's pregnacy, maybe it was not having Fred Savage behind the camera or Rob, Charlie and Glenn not actually writing most of the material that hindered Season 6, but one can only hope Season 7 will regain the remarkable momentum this show had formerly achieved.

As for the consumer, I personally will buy this season just because I've watched the first five so many times -- but ulitimately I'm sure I'll be pulling out Season 6 discs as often as Season 1 in the near future. Funny moments, but few great episodes in this DVD pack.",1311724800,18,1445,4.861788617886178
4150020,4,B003L77GJM,"Admittedly, the first two episodes were a little eh, but overall, I think it was another fantastic season.  I don't see using Kate's pregnancy as exploitative; lots of pregnant actresses have their condition written into the script.  If you're a Sunny fan, you'll still love this season.",1311033600,,287,5.085106382978723
4150021,2,B003L77GJM,"First, I just have to say that I'm a huge fan of Sunny.  One of my favorites for the last few years.  I have to say though, the writing for this season was about 2 rungs lower on the ladder than any other season.  What's to blame?  Was it Dee being pregnant?  Was it the fact that her husband (Mack) is the main writer for the show?  Are they struggling to find new ways to push the envelope?  Have they developed the existing characters as far as they can go?

Regardless of the cause, I'd say that if you're a casual watcher of this show, purchase a different season and maybe wait until this season is played on Comedy Central.  If you're a die hard fan like me, I'm sure you've already seen this season and will buy the DVD just to keep your collection intact.",1306972800,6,764,4.178082191780822

They WILL make a comeback!!! Lets face it, this is what we all look forward to in fall/winter. If ratings fall we will lose the show all together.",1306454400,2,303,4.066666666666666
4150023,3,B003L77GJM,"Something was just off about this season in many regards. The main thing being the dialogue between all the characters, which was always the strength of the show. The comedy always came from them saying ridiculous things back and forth, talking over each other, and just being rude a----es. Aside from a few episodes, it just wasn't there this season. Honestly - they just weren't as rude as they were in the past, and that's always been my favorite part. That said, there are a few solid episodes in here (the boat one, white trash, who got dee pregnant, King of the rats, and the pregnancy). However - for a show that only puts out 12 episodes a year, less than 50% being funny doesn't cut it for me.

Also - not sure if anyone else noticed, but it seems the production quality of the show improved, but I didn't like this. It was almost as if it looked too ""clean"" and bright. I've seen this happen to other shows as they get popular - they start fixing something that wasn't broke. The Office did it too when all of the sudden the production looked cinematic...not believable for a ""documentary."" It seems irrelevant, but the production is the packaging. A well written joke that isn't delivered correctly isn't funny.

Aside from Charlie Day in movies, I haven't see the other cast members doing other things much, so lets hope they put the necessary time into Season 7 and get me laughing my butt off again.",1306108800,6,1413,4.537254901960784
4150024,2,B003L77GJM,"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of one is because I genuinely am a huge fan of the cast and their work. That being said, this season had a few great moments, but really felt like it was lacking. I wish Kaitlin would have taken a break this season instead of parading around preggers. I applaud her for continuing to work through her pregnancy but it left a bad taste in my mouth as it felt like they were using her unborn child to sell the season. The last episode made me want to vomit. It was incredibly formulaic. It makes me sad that every episode was entirely predictable. One of my favorite things about the show was how shockingly funny it was. Instead I wish I could erase this season from my memory. I tried to tough it out to the very end, clinging to the frail hope that they would WOW me and it fell flat. If I were that child I would be furious and feel used.",1304121600,10,889,4.114942528735632

4150027,4,B003L77GJM,"Let me say that I am a HUGE Always Sunny fan.  The first 5 seasons were nothing short of pure genius.  Needless to say I was pumped for season 6 - but it started off very weak.  ""Mac Fights Gay Marriage"" and ""Dennis Gets Divorced"" is essentially a 2-part opening episode that falls flat.  Both of these episodes were poorly written.  I thought that this might be the beginning of the end for my favorite TV show....

Next up - ""The Gang Buys a Boat"".  Pow!  Always Sunny comes out swinging.  The gang buys a ""P. Diddy"" style fishing boat and hilarity ensues.  Some classic one-liners return: Dennis - ""Those are barnacles. Do not eat those. Do not cook them in a pot and serve them to us.""  Not to mention Charlie finding a horse tooth under water and dreaming of some sort of ""revolutionary times horse massacre"".  Oh wow.

The follow up episodes keep the funny ball rolling - especially ""Mac's Mom Burns Her House Down"" (can you say, a Golden Girls cheesecake situation?).  The gang then hits another bump in the road with ""The Gang Gets a New Member"", which, despite a funny premise, fell a bit short of my expectations.

A bump is all it turned out to be.  The final 4 episodes left me in tears.  We find out who got Dee pregnant, exactly what ""Blackface"" is, and why Charlie Kelly is indeed, king of the rats.

This is the best show on TV.  Period.  I've already pre-ordered season 6.

4150029,1,B003L77GJM,"I love Always Sunny, but even as a big fan I'm surprised to see any good reviews for this season. While I can appreciate wanting to defend your favorite show based on its history, Season 6 obviously failed to deliver.

The writing felt so off, and there was none of the usual rhythm or natural comedic flow to their banter. They were missing the spark that makes them hilarious, so instead they just felt disconnected. Some of the punchlines nearly merited a ""ba-dum-ch"" after the anti-climactic delivery. Almost every episode felt painfully forced, as if they were really digging for material. And they must have been, since in Episode 9 ""Dee Reynolds: Shaping America's Youth"" aka ""The Lethal Weapon Episode,"" Frank's uncomfortable and disgusting sex scene was so blatantly ripped off from the movie 'MacGruber' it was embarrassing. And it just seemed like, ""Well if we can't make you laugh, then we'll try to shock you!"" It was truly a sad and pathetically desperate attempt for a laugh. There were very few funny moments (countable on one hand), but as a whole to the season or even each episode it was like spitting in the ocean. Really made no difference and was dreadfully disappointing.

This is a hilarious show that my boyfriend and I both love to watch. Hopefully this was just a rough adjustment or transitional period (with the baby and all), and they get it together for next season.",1297123200,13,1397,4.79253112033195

I think 2 two stars is way too harsh for a bunch of reviews with people saying they still think the show is funny but not as funny as before.",1297036800,,363,3.9726027397260273

Buy it. I watch them from the beginning every couple months over a weekend and because of my awesome mental powers completely forget them and can watch them again as if for the first time a couple months later.
