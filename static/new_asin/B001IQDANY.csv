8311304,5,B001IQDANY,"This biography of Russell Simmons was produced by the Biography channel. For someone not familiar with Simmons' story, this well paced documentary gives a good overview of his life. Starting with key points in his childhood and moving to his college years, the film provides insight into his formation as the Godfather of Hip Hop. All of his early business partners are present and receive screen time, although early Def Jam artists are referenced but not interviewed. His segue way into the fashion industry, Def Jam Comedy, and Def Jam Poetry are all high-lighted. The description on Amazon says this was released in 2008, when it was actually released in 2005. Obviously, several years have now passed and the bio has no info since 05 (this was released before his divorce). Even though the bio is several years old, it shows how Russell built his empire. Young people, as well as adults, will surely pick up a point or two on what it takes to be successful. For what it's worth, this DVD can be watched without having to worry about any offensive language that is present in other Hip-Hop related bios/documentaries. Overall, very informative and well produced bio.",1318896000,,1170,4.884422110552764
