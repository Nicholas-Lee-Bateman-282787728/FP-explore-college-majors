8611293,5,B00F1BFL8E,"A black feather floats onto the screen blown by an unseen wind before bursting into a thousand black birds in this documentary by Inspirit Creative.  Were they harbingers of the winds that blew the land away on the High Plains during the Dust Bowl years?  It would seem so.  An ill wind blows through most of this thought-provoking film about two men, Ray Garvey and John Kriss who believed that farming on the High Plains in those 8 years of crushing drought could work successfully only if were approached as a business by making good use of a successful farmers trilogy:  (1) good farming practices, (2) opportune rain, and (3) good marketing. This powerful film tells a story that we are all familiar with but in a fresh and poignant way.  The film is so vividly done that not only can you see the dust on the farmers battered hats and feel their despair, you can taste it in your throat.  Harvesting the High Plains tells a story that has been told before by others, but not in this way.  There is a sense of the unexpected in this film.  In it you will find  previously unseen archival footage, much of it found on the shelves of the National Archives in Washington, DC, as well as a creative use of political cartoons and newspapers from the 1930s.  There are great interviews as well, including a rare audio interview with the author of The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck.  Well done and highly recommended.",1430179200,,1416,4.557312252964427
8611294,5,B00F1BFL8E,"Masterful!  The Dustbowl is usually such a vast, depressing, dry (ahem!) subject, but Jay Kriss finds a way to bring humanity and hope alive in the telling of this personal story of farmers who somehow kept believing a partnership with the land would eventually pay off.  The music and sound design are brilliant.  These guys were environmental before it was cool, and their example is needed today.  Great use of archival materials, and of dust itself as a character throughout.  Would love to see more stories from this filmmaker!",1425859200,,532,4.932584269662922

8611297,5,B00F1BFL8E,"Government destroys everything it touches. From agriculture , labor, the economy, and yes health care. I came from a farm in NC Kansas.  Esienhower destroyed thousands of acres of the richiest land in the state so the city folks could play on water. He did a lot of good things, but he screwed up when he damed up the Blue River. Now the upper half is full of silt , useless til the end of time.

Property taxes is another issue, we work this land we never own. Doubt me, don't pay your property taxes and see who comes for it. Your fricking government.",1409529600,,553,4.3076923076923075
8611298,1,B00F1BFL8E,"Thanks again for completing ruining our most fertile land.  For some reason someone said hey lets plant annuals and completely ruin this land.  And now they have.  Now you must spray roundup on everything and use a GMO to even make it grow.  I am a KANSAS BOY to the core. And I am not that old but I have saw the plains go from fertile to destroyed.  Now what does grow there is void of vitamins and just screwing with peoples health.

Big govt created big ag to create big pharma and the plan is working GREATLY!  However some Americans have a clue and are learning how to rebuild this land with rotational grazing and pastured poultry etc.  Joel Salatin taught me so much and we are beginning to see more farms based on perennial polycultures and not this big mono cropping crap.  You know you are disconnected when the farmer farms 1000's of acres but buys his meat and eggs at Wal-Mart.

We can be saved but it maybe to late!",1405987200,2,930,4.323699421965318
8611299,4,B00F1BFL8E,"Not a fan of big agribusiness, but am familiar with farming in Kansas and thought this did a good job of showing how difficult farming, especially dry land farming, can be.  As do many current documentaries, film owed a great deal to Ken Burns, and letters and recollections from the past were used effectively.  Was not as dramatic as the Burns ""Dust Bowl"" film in showing the devastation to the land and the lives during that period, but a good overall assessment of the hard work and determination of so many of those farmers.",1387929600,,529,4.617021276595745
