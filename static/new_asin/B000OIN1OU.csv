8185107,5,B000OIN1OU,Director Aaron Lubarsky is remarkable! I bet this man is a real GEM!,1412121600,,68,4.3076923076923075
8185108,4,B000OIN1OU,"This film really brings to life problems that were alluded to in documentaries I had previously watched (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-North-Korea/dp/B004HFKPOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside North Korea</a>). It follows a modern day Harriet Tubman figure as he tries to smuggle North Koreans through China to South Korea.  It is a heartbreaking documentary to watch. The interviewers and filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing each refugee they interview to life. They are real people full of hope and trust that they will make it to safety and freedom.

As the documentary shows, their success rate isn't high and this documentary does a great job of bringing to light something most Westerners are unaware of: not only the struggle of North Koreans for freedom but the struggle of those who try to help them against the Chinese government's determination to return all 'illegal immigrants' to North Korea.",1326844800,,962,5.767605633802817
8185109,5,B000OIN1OU,"Many of you who already know about the situation with North Korean defectors will not find much surprising information in here. However, the footage goes into decent detail of how some groups and individuals tried to help families cross over into China so they could move on to either Mongolia or South Korea.
The camera footage is shaky, yes, but I guess they couldn't walk around with professional equipment everywhere they went in China and North Korea.  The most touching part for me was the last part where they show the fate of the families they followed throughout the documentary and the clear footage of some of them getting caught as they try to cross over into the Japanese embassy in China.
I think it's worth the time to watch and make yourself more aware of the dire situation affecting North Korean refugees.",1321660800,,823,4.755244755244755
8185110,3,B000OIN1OU,"Seoul Train is the type of film that poses many questions but provides relatively few answers. Its purpose is simply to raise our awareness of a little known human rights crisis.

We all know that North Korea is a brutal dictatorship which does not care about the lives of its citizens. Faced with an often man made famine in which thousands have died many North Koreans attempt to defect into neighboring China to find a way to survive. Defection we are told is a capital crime in North Korea. The Chinese government however, systematically repatriates the defectors returing them home to imprisonment, torture and in some cases death.

The film follows the story of the underground railroad that has developed in China in order to help the growing amounts of refugees. A major issue here is that the official stance of the PRC is that these people  are not really refugees but illegal workers who are not entitled to asylum. The government of China has not allowed the UNHCR to step in and help either. The UNHCR is shown as ineffective and unable to complete its mandate of helping refugees.

The film introduces us to Ki-won Chun, a pastor, who has made it his mission to help the refugees escape China into Mongolia. His mission in the film fails and he is arrested and jailed. On his release from prison he begins again to build his networks to help the Koreans. Also shown is a family that attempts to escape into the Japanese Consulate which is forcibly dragged out by the Chinese police. This family eventually wins asylum because of the bad press generated by the incident.

All in all the film exposes its viewers to a developing human rights crisis that could lead to the fall of the North Korean regime and a flood of refugees not unlike the situation that happened in Eastern Europe. If this happens too quickly East Asian peace could be seriously affected.

While not an easy film to watch this film needs to be seen and discussed by as many people as possible. As the Incite Production logo says change comes about through awareness.",1193270400,6,2049,4.677777777777778
