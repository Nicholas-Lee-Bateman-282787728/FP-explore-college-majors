4470014,5,B004UQPM4E,"Superman finally gets suitable (no pun intended) treatment with this Blu-ray Anthology boxed set. All 5 feature-length films plus extended part 1 and The Richard Donner Cut of Part 2 all in top quality 1080p, every special feature ever produced that you could possibly want, every classic Max Fleischer cartoon and ""making of"" special, galleries, commentaries, even the ""Super Pup"" pilot and ""Superman & the Mole Men"" starring George Reeves. We all know parts 3, 4 & ""Returns"" weren't as good as parts 1 & 2, but I've always enjoyed them nonetheless, and now even more so... they just look so fantastic on my 52"" Sony Bravia! Even the box's slipcase design is super (pun intended) it's as if you're opening a holy relic or lost artifact... which for me, it is! If Amazon allowed for it, I'd give this release 10 stars right down to the last molecule of cardboard that the box is made of, it's that SUPER!!!",1308009600,6,906,4.66875
4470015,5,B004UQPM4E,"Judge Dan Mancini, DVD Verdict -- ""Ponder this, whippersnappers: Back in the 1970s, there was no such thing as the superhero movie. Studio executives found the idea of feature films about tights-wearing crime fighters so absurd and juvenile that they refused to bankroll them. That is until, fresh off of their epic two-film adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers, French film producing father-and-son team Alexander and Ilya Salkind set their sights on bringing Superman to the silver screen. To be sure, Superman was a massive pop culture icon long before the Salkinds came around. The creation of writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster (both the sons of Jewish-American immigrants), the big daddy of all superheroes had been in comic books and newspapers for nearly four decades, and had successfully made the leap to radio serials in the 1940s and television in the 1950s. Superman was as indelible in American popular culture as Mickey Mouse long before the Salkinds got their hands on the movie rights to his story. Still, even in the wake of the fantasy movie success of George Lucas' Star Wars, no one really believed that a Superman movie would fly at the box office.

Back then, when we thought of a flesh-and-blood Man of Steel, we thought of George Reeves changing in the Daily Planet broom closet and leaping from a springboard out of the window of a plywood set on The Adventures of Superman television series. The show had been enormously popular among kids during its six-season run in the 1950s, and was still a hit among kids in the '70s (myself included), who watched it religiously in reruns. The idea of someone other than Reeves donning the blue suit and red cape was almost unfathomable--as was the idea of a Superman movie sans Leon Klatzkin's heroic theme music. In the early days of December 1978, we had no clue what the Salkinds and their director, Richard Donner (fresh off of his success with The Omen), were about to unleash on us. We couldn't imagine or anticipate how swiftly and decisively Christopher Reeve would wrench the mantle of Superman away from George Reeves, or how John Williams' amazing score--as indelible as his previous work on Jaws and Star Wars--would become so entwined with the Man of Steel in our cultural imagination that it's now difficult to even remember what Klatzkin's theme sounded like.

Superman: The Motion Picture Anthology is a mammoth eight-disc Blu-ray box set containing all five Warner Bros. Superman features made between 1978 and 2006, including two versions of Superman: The Movie and Superman II, as well as enough extras to choke Krypto the Superdog. It's hard to imagine what more Superman fans could want. If you love these movies as much as I do (and, granted, I love Superman III and IV for entirely different reasons than I do the first two movies), then this set is a must-own.""

4470016,5,B004UQPM4E,"I was really excited to see the never-before-released ""Return to Krypton"" sequence from ""Superman Returns,"" but I know there are still several deleted scenes from ""Superman: The Movie,"" Superman II,"" and ""Superman III"" which have NEVER been released anywhere that I know of. What's the reasoning behind this? In ""The Movie,"" from what I've heard there was a scene from a TV version where Jonathan and Martha Kent are talking in the truck about their lives right before the meteor lands. There was also an extended scene between young Clark Kent and Lana Lang with Jeff East's original voice not dubbed (this one can be seen on Youtube). In ""Superman II,"" there's a cut scene where the young boy from the town the villains invade jumps on a white pony and tries to escape, then General Zod said ""I said NO ONE LEAVES!"" and Non throws a police car siren at the boy, killing him. Part of this scene appeared in the documentary ""You Will Believe"" included on the set, but not all of it. There are also several other scenes that were shown in previous TV versions, such as two pilots on an airplane seeing Superman fly by. In ""Superman III,"" it would have been nice to include the original opening title sequence which took place in outer space (this is also viewable on Youtube). From ""Superman Returns,"" we're still missing the scene where young Clark discovers the crystals in the barn (a clip was seen in the trailer), Clark Kent hiding his Superman outfit in a janitor's closet at the Daily Planet, and a meeting between Perry White and Superman on the street (this was shown in a TV version). I guess we'll never be able to have any of these scenes on an actual disc to enjoy over and over again. :-(",1307836800,59,1701,4.580327868852459
4470017,5,B004UQPM4E,"Finally, the original Superman series hits Blu ray.  I still don't get why this didn't happen way back in 2006 when the dvd set came out.  All we got were a poor transfer of the extended version of the first film, a great transfer of the Donner Cut of part 2, and a fairly poor transfer of Superman Returns.  Here we get 'em all, plus they are all new transfers from the previous releases making it beyond worth picking up.

All, and I mean ALL, the special features from the previous dvd set is included in this eight blu ray disc box set.  Now maybe someone out there can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall, on the box set dvd or the blu ray, the previous releases of Superman Returns having the deleted scene of Superman returning the barron and destroyed planet Krypton searching for life in his crystal spaceship.  I've never seen this five minutes sequence before in my life.  I've only seen snippets of it on the theatrical trailers for the film.  Well, I got to see it for the first time today.  While Returns is no great film, this scene should have been left in.  It would've opened the film up more.  Even weirder is this scene is completely finished.  All the effects are GREAT and finished and polished.  I can't believe they cut this scene.  Hell, there were even action figures made of Superman's space suit and his ship back in 2006 for a sequence that was never even seen by mainstream film goers.  Whatever.  All the other deleted scenes and extended cuts are here too. All the films have their commentaries included, except Returns which never had one unfortunately.

Of course some of the special features are repetitive.  The commentaries repeat some of the info give in the featurettes and documentaries.  Back in 2001 a box set for the first four films was released on dvd.  Only the first film had special features and an extended cut.  The documentary, cut into three parts, is included.  While this doc repeats a lot of what is on the eighth disc's featurettes regarding the whole series' history, it does skim over the on set tensions and the firing of Richard Donner from the directing duties of part 2.  So, essentially, if you're a hardcore fan like me, you will have to view both.  We get the first feature film of Superman starring George Reeves called Superman and the Mole Men, not really in HD unfortunately.  Even better is we the classic animated shorts from Fleischer studios.  They're not cleaned up but they look pretty good in a low grade version of hi def.  The audio of all movies has been upgraded and it reall shows.

Shockingly to me, is that the AWFUL Superman IV: The Quest for Peace looks really good in hi def.  I mean, it never looked that good, and all the edges of the effects always showed, but the blu ray transfer doesn't make them MORE apparent, but the colors look good.  Go figure.  My favorite part of the part IV disc is the deleted scenes.  Now these scenes make the film seem more whole and help it make a ton more sense, especially towards the third act, but the movie stilled would've been just as awful.  It just would've been a comprehensible mess as opposed to what it is.  I also appreciate co-screenwriter Mark Rosenthal committing a commentary to this disc, as well as an interview for the 8th disc docs.  He is frank and never once tries to polish this turd that he worked on.  He's the only one from this film that even bothered to comment, so I more than appreciate it.  Something about filmmakers talking about movies that didn't work always intrigues me more than the ones that do, just see the Joel Schumacher commentary for Batman and Robin.  Superman Returns FINALLY looks the way it should.  The colors pop and the sound booms.  All previous dvd and blu ray versions of this film were terrible, and even more so when you see the new disc, which kept all the previous releases special features and included the video diaries which were an exclusive to the Superman tin from 2006.

Finally, the last thing I'll mention, is Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut.  This is the best special feature ever made for any movie ever made in the history of movies.  I'm super happy that Warner Brothers paid to have this experiment made, that Donner cared enough to give it a whirl, and that it was worth watching.  Most people who initially reviewed this movie just DIDN'T GET IT.  It wasn't a complete representation of Donner's vision for Superman II.  Most people complained that it had the same ending as the first film.  Well, if you bothered to listen to the commentary or watch the doc that accompanies the disc you would know that they were behind while shooting both films back to back, and decided to hedge their bets and not assume that Superman: The Movie would be an instant hit.  They stole the ending from part II and stuck it on the first film.  Since Donner never got to make part II he has no ending to put but the one that was scripted when he was making the film over thirty years ago.  So this is more of an experiment than a competition for the theatrical Lester version.  This is as close to Donner's movie as we'll ever get.  Personally, I loved it.  The screen test footage sticks out like a sore thumb, the acting and writing is GREAT, and Superman's reveal to Lois is clever and fun, as opposed to the dumb Lester version of Clark tripping into a fire.  If you watch the doc or listen to the commentary you will understand what shots were all Donner stuff.  If you have a keen eye for film you'll now anyway.  The effects work and photography and choreography for Donner's footage is sooooo much more graceful and classy.  While his films have goofy humor, the villains from Krypton are played straight and malevolent, unlike the Lester version.  Now I don't hate the Lester version.  It's enjoyable, but an obvious step down in tone and quality from the first film.  It will forever be the offical sequel due to Donner never having filmed or even been give the opportunity to come up with a third act.  Now the only annoyance of the Donner cut for me, beyond the reused end of the first film, is that the middle section is very choppy.  The scenes that cut between the alien invasion and Superman and Lois falling further in love are harshly edited and don't always breath enough.  That's it.  Donner reveals much bitterness regarding not having stayed on board for all the Superman movies, but he seems jovial all the time.  I'm happy he was able to get some closure, and really happy that fans like me could have such a neat gift.  It's also bittersweet in the sense that the Donner cut shows so much potential it makes you feel slighted regarding what he eventually got with the series and the downward spiral it took.

All discs are upgraded in audio and visuals so for any Superman fan it's a no brainer.  This is an upgrade.  Now I understand if you don't care to own the later films, but you will have to wait as I'm sure they will all be released individually just like the Batman films.  This will probably happen to coincide with the release of Zach Snyder's upcoming Superman film next year.  I'm hoping the next Superman film is truly just a tale of Superman and NOT another origin story.  It's been done in the comics, movies, cartoons, and tv shows.  NO MORE.  Who doesn't know Superman's origins at this point.  I will be very bored if that's the case.  We'll see.  Fingers crossed.",1307404800,165,7402,4.50827067669173

The 5 disc set comes with only the theatrical releases of the five films, not the extended editions or donner cut. You still get some of the other features like the making of documentaries, the cartoons, and the original film with ""Superman and the Mole Men"".

The transfers are good, so if all you wanted was the movies then you are fine, but don't order this set thinking you are getting extra versions of the movies. Check the info before you add to cart. I'm still happy because all I really wanted was the movies, the cartoons and George Reeves film were still nice bonuses, but I was set aback when I put the disc in and saw no alternate cuts available.",1483574400,13,937,4.293785310734464

All the details tell me this is a set from a third part manufacture located in a spanish country.  They attempted to reproduce this set.  I'm not going to claim they are illegally reproducing it (I do not know what rights they have purchased) but I will say it is a very poor quality reproduction.

I have spoken with Amazon.  I am returning the product and getting a refund.  I am going to attempt to reorder it and hopefully get the correct set that is pictured in the description.  I will update this later once I receive it.",1483228800,4,920,4.315789473684211

I was really hesitant, because a lot of older films don't always transfer well digitally and the first four movies were filmed on well film. But to my surprise the picture quality is a huge improvement on the DVDs, and the remastering gives all these movies new life.

I will say that while the set itself looks pretty great, in a stylish box nicely laid out, the box is in english but the discs are in spanish. However, when played they will be in english.

An important note, it's actually very hard to figure out which blu ray is which, since each disc is JUST a picture of Christopher Reeve on it, with exception to Brandon Routh. In order to figure out which disc is which, you have to squint your eyes and really focus on the TINY print on the bottom, saying which movie and version it is.

The sound is quite good and the subwoofer really kicks whith regards to the age of the first four films, but the picture doesn't hold up to newer productions.

Add the fact that those disks include Looney Tunes themed cartoons, George Reeves in Superman and The Mole Men and the 40s Superman series is amazing, the George Reeves movie has a nice message even if visually dated. However, the animated series is amazing because the animation holds up well especially for it's time.

Then their is Superman 3; in my opinion it's the worst it's dull and besides Lana and Superman theirs no interesting characters and bad attempts at humor (sorry Richard Pryor).
Superman IV: Quest for Peace is so low budget you might get some laughs watching that one at least.

Then theirs Superman Returns, I think it still looks good, a little too brown in the color and the movie is a bit too long but other then that it's okay.

I really liked the extras disk it really gave me insight into the characters history and insight into the movies themselves. Also The Adventures of Superpup was a very weird.",1460246400,,1190,4.599056603773585

The discs don't have the actual TITLES of the movie on them so you can't tell which is which. They don't even have DISC numbers. The pictures printed on the DISCS are cheap looking so for sure someone was trying to make it look right. The box is different, I returned these, paid an extra $20 and got the real ones (US VERSION). The US box opens from the top and Superman's BIG (S) on the box comes off with the top, thus the discs slide out from the too. The ""European Version,"" slides out from the side and the S is not nearly as pronounced, if you care about that. However you might care that the DISCS DID NOT play on my Blu-Ray player even though it states that it is FOR ALL REGIONS. I did get it to play on my PS4. The quality seemed fine but I haven't compared it to the US version. I think the seller should let people know what you are getting.

If not for those feckless boobs, we would not have the disgraceful movies that are Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest For Peace.

Needless to say, I was devastated to find that documentary disc no longer played in ANY of my players. Neither my Xbox 360, Xbox one, nor my PS2 or blu-ray/dvd players.

4470166,4,B004UQPM4E,"All the Bluray transfers look great, and all except Superman IV are defaulted at DTS Master sound.
Warner Bros clearly spent most of the remastered audio money on the first half of Superman 1. The sound is awesome, but clearly drops off after Superman flies out of the Fortress Of Solitude and the story moves to Metropolis. The John Williams theme is an absolute classic..... do yourself a favor and turn up the volume on the S1 opening.
Superman 1 and 2,  Superman Returns and the extras are the reason I purchased this box set (along with the price).
Didn't care for the Donner unnecessary recut version of S2, S3 was a travesty and painful to watch and IMHO S4 could have been a better movie with a better script, a better director, a bigger budget and a more serious Lex Luthor.  Some of the special effects look great, while most look cheap.
The discs are region free and while the disc labels are in Spanish, the on screen menus are in English.
Full disclosure.....I love the memory of Chris Reeve as Superman and the memory of going to the Cinerama in Los Angeles on opening day with the audience going crazy as the opening theme blasted in the theater!

4470182,5,B004UQPM4E,"THE FILMS: Not having seen the Christopher Reeve Superman films before, I was essentially guilted into buying this collection (really, it was my choice to see them in this way). Thank goodness I did get this, though. There are several comic book films that I'd put above these, but I feel like I did myself a service by hunkering down and marathon-ing this Blu-ray set over the course of a month. This set contains the following feature films:
- Superman: The Movie (1978)
- Superman: The Movie - Expanded Edition (2001)
- Superman II (1980)
- Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (2006)
- Superman III (1983)
- Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)
- Superman Returns (2006)
For my thoughts on those, you can visit their respective Amazon pages. Both versions of SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II are listed on the same page, so the review contains both. My general thoughts on the series (1-4) are that while they opened the door for the flood of comic book adaptations that were to come in the following decades, there are aspects which haven't aged as well, namely the lighter tone and some of the special effects. Even still I enjoyed them all, particularly the first two.

THE SUPPLEMENTS: Despite only giving entries in the series 3-4 stars, the extra material provided is why I'm giving this set 5 stars. There is just so much stuff for the film fan to dig into. The first four films each have commentaries, with the first two having a separate one for each version. There are also several documentaries, vintage and retrospective, which cover all aspects of production. For me, the retrospective docs were a little more valuable in terms of assessing the successes and failures of the films, as well as providing more detailed information on how they were made. That's not to put down the vintage specials, which did have some behind-the-scenes footage, but they just didn't hold up as well. In particular, the Lorne Michaels-produced 50th Anniversary Special was rather corny and stupid. Still, it's impressive how complete they were in what they included. Additionally, there was a wealth of material not related to the films or their production. Perhaps the most interesting/substantial of these was the theatrical feature SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE-MEN, which served as a pilot for the George Reeves TV series. They also included all 17 Fleischer/Famous Studios Superman animated shorts. While they were well-animated, the subject matter and tone dated them considerably. For SUPERMAN RETURNS, there wasn't any commentary but there was a nearly 3-hour documentary on the making of the film and a short featurette on how they digitally recreated Marlon Brando. There was also roughly 80 minutes of Bryan Singer's video journals he made during production. The most interesting segments, however, were jokes. In one, Bryan Singer ""takes over"" for Peter Jackson on KING KONG, and the other one has Frank Darabont ""replace"" Bryan Singer. Otherwise very thorough, if a bit dry at times. However, the crown jewel of the additional material in this anthology set is the Bonus Disc, which has the bulk of the retrospectives. The two biggest explore the history of the Superman character and the production history of the Christopher Reeve films. Lots of great anecdotes and interesting information, particularly for someone who doesn't read comics and hasn't followed the history. The only hole I could find was that they were unable to interview Richard Lester for any of the documentaries. His perspective would have made all of this as complete as possible. There is also a shorter featurette on Superman's cultural influences and role as modern mythology. They wrap things up with a touching tribute to Christopher Reeve and a surreal/stupid, unaired pilot for THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERPUP (which thankfully never went to series). Aside from all I mentioned before, there was the usual extras like deleted/extended scenes and trailers.

OVERALL: Say what you will about the films themselves, which have become a pillar of pop culture and continue to be loved/reviled to this day. I certainly enjoyed watching them for the first time, and look forward to rewatching them in the future. What really makes this set worth your money is the care that went into the films' restoration (they look stunningly good) and the material provided to supplement them. I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a better Blu-ray set that I've so enthusiastically delved into. And, for those who worry about such things, the actual physical set is well-constructed. It comes in a slip-case and the inside container opens up with four separate compartments that house two discs each. Honestly, I prefer when they have cases with ""pages"" with one disc per side, but the spacing between each disc is sufficient so that they don't touch each other. If you're a Superman fan or like comic books movies in general, I could not more highly recommend this set. It will be money well-spent.",1434585600,18,4950,4.991525423728813

4470188,4,B004UQPM4E,"Superman is a super hero for teenagers with no complicated innuendo in the first three films, that is to say up to 1983. In 1987 they ran into dire straits and foul waters in the world with the end of the USSR looming more or less high in the night sky. We sure were at a turning point in history with the end of Reagan, Bush Sr. taking over for a short while in 1988 and the Iron Curtain falling in 1989. Those years were feeling bizarre. China was moving but it was not yet obvious it was going to go that fast. They were at the very beginning of a new era. Were we optimistic or were we sad because of the good old simple split world that was vanishing at high speed? I don't want to remember. More than twenty-five years later we just do not regret that period that changed many things but also re-dynamized the whole world.

And yet war was everywhere, conflicts erupted in all corners of the planet and the US were blowing on embers and flames to have it more gigantic than it already was. Iran-Iraq, then Iraq-Kuwait, then the Gulf war pretty soon. The Middle East was becoming the center of global warfare and arms dealing. So the fourth film deals with that and tries to set up a dream that is just as phenomenal and absurd as taking an aspirin tablet to cure cancer or leukemia. But they dared. Make people dream about peace and you might get good cash flow in the cinemas. But the series was to stop for 19 years. Actually Superman was just plainly dead, our Superman.

But he comes back from Krypton. The actor has been changed in the mean time. And his love affair with his journalist colleague provided him with a son who is only six or seven in the last film, nineteen years later. Some pregnancies can be very long. That's the most surprising fact in this series: the time line is not exactly right. And yet this film is essential because they seem to be preparing this son to be the next Superman. That was nine years ago. So the child should be of age now to return under his own identity. But will he? Behind all that there does not seem to be a long lasting project. The first three films are rather pubescent and very superficial. The fourth film is just unreal. It no longer is a superhero but a super sleeping pill for politically disoriented kids in a changing world. The last film is like an after thought to regain some cash desk money and maybe prepare a real return. But will Superman really return?

The last film is the only one that has the proper special effects for today's cinema and audience. It is also the first film that really has a villain that actually succeeds including in failing and finding himself and his bimbo lost on a small desert island eating dogmeat. But that will not be a new ""Lost"" series. The island is too small and there is no connection to any real past period. And then there is something morbid in the end of the ""episode"" with Superman's disappearance from his death bed at the hospital, his appearance in his ""son's"" bedroom to say goodbye and bless him for his future as well as saying goodbye to his ""son's"" mother and then he finally disappears into space. Where to? We do not know. This last film is such a transition episode towards something else that has not come yet and may never come that it is plain nostalgic, pathetic and pointless.

Superman was such a success in his comic and filmic life that we wonder why? Because of the superficiality of the character and the shallowness of the discourse? I guess it is in the do-gooder nature of this character that we can find the answer: Superman is a pacifier, is the cinema Prozac of the western world delivered to the people in massive doses. And they do not get an overdose. Or maybe they did so that when the real change arrived with the fall the USSR they did not even react and let the warmongers of the west believe they could start moving their troops towards Siberia and Mongolia. But they were sleep walking in such a deep dream that the public had a very hard wake up hangover and the political wizards had to swallow the worst crisis since 1929, in fact eighty years earlier. In 2009. And Superman did not come back to clean up the stables of Wall Street.

These films are not too heady and brainy and I guess children of six or seven years of age can watch them without too much damage. But be careful and don't let your children believe it is the real world. It sure isn't. Just ask yourself how many blacks are in influential positions and how many Chinese or even Asians are ever shown as having real power in this world. Asking the question is answering it. It is a film for those who have never experienced a trauma in their life. The reveille of tomorrow's shift of power will make them suddenly realize they have been doped.

Well-priced and complete with so many extras.  Not only do you get the original movie from 1978 but also the Extended Edition.  Superman II is a bit of a surprise.  You get the Theatrical Release as well as the 2006 Richard Donner Cut.  Two very different movies.  Apparently both Superman and Superman II were being filmed at the same time from a huge script penned by Godfather author Mario Puzo.  They would shoot a scene for the first film on whatever set they were using, then shift and shoot scenes for the second movie on the same set (say The Daily Planet set).  But time constraints to get the first film released led to Donner focusing his energy primarily on the first  movie (he says that 75% of the second movie was already in the can).  In the end, Donnor would be replaced by Richard Lester on the project, and though many of his scenes (25% in his estimation) would be used without crediting his work, a good portion of the movie had to be-shot in order to give Lester directing credit.  Exit any footage of Marlon Brando.  The studio didn't want to pay him any more money for the additional scenes he had shot with Donner. What we have, when a team went through the 6 tons of footage, is a completely different movie.  Where Superman II tried to be grandiose and over-the-top, Donner had a more streamline vision.  The Eiffel Tower scene with the nuclear bomb that winds up springing General Zod and his mates from the Phantom Zone is gone.  Lois is onto Clark immediately when she draws glasses and a hat over a picture of Superman in the newspaper, she then jumps out of a window at the Daily Planet to prove her point.  She later gets him to slip when she fires a gun at him. Like I said, its a completely different movie.  Superman III with Richard Pryor remains untouched as does the 4th installment.  Superman Returns, which completely blots out the 3rd and 4th movie, and continues right where II left off is an underrated achievement by X-Men director Bryan Singer.  There is an extras disc that will finish everything off and leave you reeling.  Each Blu-ray is also packed with extras from Making Of documentaries to Fleisher Superman cartoons to the classic 1951 George Reeves Superman And The Mole Men adventure.  Chockfull of Superman!

4470247,5,B004UQPM4E,"Superman:5 Film Collection consists of five Superman films such as the following:

1. Superman: The Movie is the best movie about the caped crusader hero. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman. Aside from the adventures of the superhero,it also gives us an idea of his character,humanity and his vulnerability. In summary,this movie is a timeless delight.

2. Superman II:The Richard Donner Cut would have been an epic if it was completed. After viewing this film,it was definitely a lot better and more dramatic than that was released theatrically back in 1980. Lois Lane was more clever in catching that Clark Kent is Superman. Marlon Brando's presence elevated the film into new heights. Aside from that,there was less comical scenes which turned the original Superman II some sort of a slapstick comedy. Also,the existence of the Supervillains were fully explained as well. With regards to the actors involved,we can see that they are more energized with Donner than with Lester especially those who did re- shoots like Reeve,Kidder and Stamp. Finally,the plot was less predictable and clichd as compared to Lester's theatrical version. Overall,it would have been the better movie had it been completed that would probably hold a candle to the first Superman movie and I give this one a perfect rating inspite of its not being finished as well.

3. Superman III turned into becoming a different film compared to Superman:The Movie and Superman II:The Richard Donner's Cut for it became a comedic film especially with Richard Pryor's presence. Aside from that,Vaughn's villainous portrayal of Ross Webster was an uninspired fill-in for Lex Luthor or the Supervillains. Of course,the big blame goes for Richard Lester,a director who more into comedy rather adventure films like Superman. It would have been better that they have retained Richard Donner for the Superman franchise,who could have done a better job with it. Added to that,the absence of Gene Hackman and the near-absence of Margot Kidder,who was limited to 5 minutes of screen time by Salkinds for expressing her disgust on the firing of Donner,proved disastrous to the film. Obviously,the love story between Lana Lang and Clark Kent isn't as interesting as compared to Lois Lane and Superman/Clark Kent after what they have gone through in the first two films. The only good thing about it is the performance of Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman. Overall,if you are looking for some laughs,the Superman III is the film to watch!!!

4. Superman IV:The Quest For Peace 5/10 is the least interesting of the four Superman movies done by Christopher Reeve. If the first two films were a classic and Superman III was entertaining enough for good laughs,the fourth film was definitely horrible. The performances of the cast were simply decent. Christopher Reeve does not look to be in top shape as the Man of Steel and he looks tired as Superman and Clark Kent,who was relegated from a bumbling man to a dork in this film. Aside from that,the other cast like Hackman and Kidder look uninspired in their portrayal as Lex Luthor and Lois Lane respectively. The others gave average performances. As for the story,the movie was definitely predictable from beginning to end. Nuclear Man was simply a horrible villain and the least interesting as compared to the Supervillains,the evil Superman and even Gus Gorman. In summary,the action is boring. The special effects look cheaper. And most of all,nobody appears interested in where the story is going. Sidney J. Furie's direction simply is lackluster. It was in the least interesting among all the films that has been shown including Superman Returns.

5. Superman Returns reintroduces the viewer to the superhero. The film does great job in doing that. At the same time,we get to go back Superman:The Movie and Superman II,two great films,from which the story updates us from and neglect the other two films - Supermans III and IV - two poorly made films. The use of special effects were wonderful as well. It makes us appreciate the powers of Superman as they look very realistic as possible. The story was not as good as the first two Superman but nevertheless it wasn't as bad as the last two sequels so it was still worth the view.

This is definitely a great collection of Superman films.",1413072000,,4660,5.069100391134289
4470248,5,B004UQPM4E,"The Superman Anthology Collection is a great group of Superman movies that has 5 movies that stars Christopher Reeve and another - Superman Returns - which gives homage to those films.

*Superman: The Movie is definitely the best movie about the caped crusader hero as it stands still. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman.

Marlon Brando's presence elevated the film into new heights. Aside from that,there was less comical. Also,the existence of the Supervillains were fully explained as well. With regards to the actors involved,we can see that they are more energized with Donner than with Lester especially those who did re- shoots like Reeve,Kidder and Stamp. Finally,the plot was less predictable an compared to Lester's theatrical version. It was still a better movie than the theatrical release. No question about it.

*Superman II is a great follow-up to the first film considering that it retains all the delightful characteristics that the first movie has like adventure,tension,suspense and humor. Also,this one goes deeper into the love story between Superman and Lois Lane as well as the sacrifices each one is willing to go forward into their relationship; and the battle between Superman and the Supervillains.

*Superman III may have turned more into a slapstick comedy especially with comic Richard Pryor's presence. It definitely has changed its direction but nevertheless,it still manages to provide entertainment with the Clark Kent returning to Smallville and having a new love interest in Lana Lang and witnessing a great performance from Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman.

*Superman IV:The Quest For Peace could probably the least interesting film that Christopher Reeve has done as Superman but nevertheless,it still has great themes about World Peace.

*Superman Returns reintroduces the viewer to the superhero. The film does great job in doing that. At the same time,we get to go back Superman:The Movie and Superman II,two great films,from which the story updates us from. The use of special effects were wonderful as well.

*Superman Returns is the wrap up of the Superman series that was started by Richard Donner in Superman:The Movie. It was Brian Singer's homage to it. It reintroduces us to the hero and provides a Christopher Reeve-looking Superman in Brandon Routh. It may not be at equal with the Donner's film,but still manages to provide us great memories of the characters of the franchise and the events that have happened in Supermans I and II. Obviously,it was a great conclusion for it before a complete reboot was made and the Man Of Steel was released.",1413072000,,2249,5.377840909090909
4470250,5,B004UQPM4E,"I love the fact that Superman 1, Superman 2, and Superman Returns make a semi-logical trilogy, and here, we have all three of them in one set.

Everyone knows that Christopher Reeves's first two Superman movies are two parts of the same story, but one of the events in Superman 2 set up one of the situations that is a plot element of Superman 5 (Superman Returns).

In Superman 2, Superman voluntarily gives up his powers, so that he could have a relationship with Lois, and while non-powered, he and Lois consummate their friendship. But then, necessity forces Clark to reclaim his powers, and he realizes that Lois cannot handle the memory of their relationship, so he hypnotizes Lois into totally forgetting their relationship (and of course, forgetting the sex).

At some point, presumably a few months later, Lex Luthor tricks Superman into flying off to see the remains of his old home planet. This journey takes five years.

Superman Returns, the sort-of-sequel to Superman 2, starts with Superman's return to Earth. He soon discovers that Lois has a son who is about five years old. During the movie, we see evidence that the young boy has limited (only surfacing in times of stress) superpowers. Superman eventually learns this, himself.

Of course, there is much more to this movie, but I really enjoy the fact that this part of the story could be in honor of Christopher Reeves's portrayal of Superman.

EDIT 7/26/2015

P.S. I finally noticed, months after getting this package, that it contains the Richard Donner cut, which I only got around to watching in the last few weeks. It is easily the best of the Superman 2 movies. Richard Donner was directing both Superman 1 and Superman 2 at the same time, so that he could have more control of the process. Unfortunately, he was fired, and Lester was brought in to finish the two movies. Eventually, in 2000 and 2006, we got a chance to finally see a better view of Richard Donner's visions for the characters as he produced and released his own versions of Superman 1 and 2.",1412380800,,2036,4.734463276836158

4470255,5,B004UQPM4E,"If you have a love for Superman or simply wish to explore what has been done on the Man Of Steel, this set will leave you pretty much satisfied on the subject.  8 Blu-rays make this the defining set.  Well-priced and complete with so many extras.  Not only do you get the original movie from 1978 but also the Extended Edition.  Superman II is a bit of a surprise.  You get the Theatrical Release as well as the 2006 Richard Donner Cut.  Two very different movies.  Apparently both Superman and Superman II were being filmed at the same time from a huge script penned by Godfather author Mario Puzo.  They would shoot a scene for the first film on whatever set they were using, then shift and shoot scenes for the second movie on the same set (say The Daily Planet set).  But time constraints to get the first film released led to Donner focusing his energy primarily on the first  movie (he says that 75% of the second movie was already in the can).  In the end, Donnor would be replaced by Richard Lester on the project, and though many of his scenes (25% in his estimation) would be used without crediting his work, a good portion of the movie had to be-shot in order to give Lester directing credit.  Exit any footage of Marlon Brando.  The studio didn't want to pay him any more money for the additional scenes he had shot with Donner. What we have, when a team went through the 6 tons of footage, is a completely different movie.  Where Superman II tried to be grandiose and over-the-top, Donner had a more streamline vision.  The Eiffel Tower scene with the nuclear bomb that winds up springing General Zod and his mates from the Phantom Zone is gone.  Lois is onto Clark immediately when she draws glasses and a hat over a picture of Superman in the newspaper, she then jumps out of a window at the Daily Planet to prove her point.  She later gets him to slip when she fires a gun at him. Like I said, its a completely different movie.  Superman III with Richard Pryor remains untouched as does the 4th installment.  Superman Returns, which completely blots out the 3rd and 4th movie, and continues right where II left off is an underrated achievement by X-Men director Bryan Singer.  There is an extras disc that will finish everything off and leave you reeling.  Each Blu-ray is also packed with extras from Making Of documentaries to Fleisher Superman cartoons to the classic 1951 George Reeves Superman And The Mole Men adventure.  Chockfull of Superman!

UK, all the discs play on my Oppo 93, my Sony and my Samsung players (they are all 3-D players; I don't know if that would make a difference.). They even play on the Blu-ray player in my laptop. Searching the discs, I find in tiny letters and numbers, ""BD-01""--I'm thinking that's U.S. regional code. Go figure!

The five films are pristine in the BD versions. It's great to see Chris Reeve flying so clearly again, and Brandon Routh looks great in ""Superman Returns"". I enjoyed his performance (much better than I liked Henry Cavill's in ""Man of Steel"" which seemed to lose all we've come to know as the Superman legend and character. But neither one of them can really touch the great Chris Reeve.

It's great to have all the extras: all the documentaries and commentary. ""Superman I-IV"" and ""Superman Returns"" in one set. I am sooooo glad I ""mistakenly"" bought it!",1404086400,2,1123,4.527093596059113

4470286,5,B004UQPM4E,"So read the tagline to Richard Donner's original Superman starring Christopher Reeve. The films in this collection are an uneven lot, capped off by Brandon Routh's notoriously dower turn as the man of steel. Only the first two movies are really worth remembering. Superman III is pretty much a farce - a Richard Pryor comedy wrapped in Superman's cape. The Quest for Peace should never have been made. And Routh...well, don't quit your day job...what'ever that may be.

But it's the first two movies that are worth their weight in gold - hands down and absolutely the finest super hero movies ever made - period. All-star cast put to exceptionally good use - Trevor Howard, Marlon Brandon, Glenn Ford, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Margo Kidder and, of course, Christopher Reeve - still the most butch and best to don the cape and spandex suit. Reeve infuses the character with charm, also a hunky 'other-worldly appeal. You can believe that he isn't from this planet.

Yes, the movie's badly mangle the narrative timeline. The comics took place in the forties and that's precisely where Reeve's characterization comes from - the old serialized TV persona. Yet, he takes the character - if not himself - quite seriously, and this makes all the difference in the world.

Warner has hacked out a ton of extra features for this box set. Most are presented in less than stellar quality. Leaving us to discuss the transfers themselves. Overall, good, a few minor caveats; hints of edge enhancement, residual softness, occasional color fading (very minimal). Overall, a worthwhile set to add to your collection. Just don't expect perfection and you'll be alright.",1402099200,4,1653,4.981884057971015

4470294,5,B004UQPM4E,Im a fan of blu-ray and this collection was definitely going to be added. Christopher Reeve is sensational. Spectacular High-Def,1400025600,,128,5.45
4470295,5,B004UQPM4E,"I won't review this entire set, which other reviewers have done so well. I'll just concentrate on Richard Donner's original Superman movie, which I think is still by far the best in the series, including Man of Steel, in terms of covering all the ground in the myth and getting the tone of the story just right.

Delightfully included here is the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL CUT of Donner's gem! While I like the scenes that Donner added for his longer director's cut (also included here), which add more weight to the story and characters, the theatrical cut is tighter and moves at a quicker Super pace. Donner's longer cut also forces music editors to meddle with John Williams' classic music, repeating notes that weren't meant to be repeated.

The visual transfer is VERY sharp. The edges of Geoffrey Unsworth's foggy, misty, diffused 70mm cinematography really pop, with the reds of Supe's cape extraordinarily vibrant. My only complaint is the highlights (the brightest areas of the picture) seem to be blown out compared to earlier releases of this film on LD and VHS. This is undoubtedly and unfortunately a flaw in the now-faded original negative. No detail in the pure white highlights has a tendency to make the front-projection process shots of Superman flying, especially in the daytime, look fake. Otherwise, this is a beautiful-looking transfer.

The 5.1 surround sound re-mix appears to have been done from scratch, with all-new sound-effects and a multi-track mix of John Williams' classic music taken from two sets of mics placed in different areas of the London Symphony Orchestra's pit. The result is a new mix that is spectacular, mind-blowing, a sonic powerhouse! Warner's sound designers and mixers did a fabulous job!

There are only two sections in the new mix that I don't agree with, and they have to do with the handling of John Williams' music:

1) In the opening credits, right before the ""A Richard Donner Film"" credit appears, the level of the music was apparently too loud, forcing the mixers to make a last-second snap-decision to lower the level quickly with their sliders before it distorts, which sounds quite jarring. A little more care should've been taken there to quiet down the loud level more smoothly a few notes earlier during the previous title's ""swoosh"" sound-effect. John Williams' music for Superman is legendary, spectacular, a piece of cinema history, and deserves a proper, loving presentation.

2) Late in the movie, when Superman drops Jimmy Olsen off in the canyon and says ""You're safe here, son."", to which Jimmy replies ""It's OK! Miss Lane'll be comin' by in a few minutes!"", the level of John Williams' music is almost completely dropped. This was apparently to make their voices more heard, but we can barely hear the music at all, and the scene drops flat right there as a result, sounds like a documentary. The level of the music there should've been louder!

If you prefer the nostalgic pre-5.1 2-channel 1978 Dolby Stereo mix, contrary to another reviewer complaining about its absence, it IS here, in the theatrical cut, on English Audio 2 (English 2.0)! That mix sounds as good here as 1978 technology would allow. There's some deep bass, blary highs and nice reverb in the opening and closing credits music which sounds reminiscent of its presentation in theatrical cinemas in 1978!

Overall, this is an excellent set, that completes any collector's dream, and gets top marks from me. Enjoy!",1399680000,,3452,4.97053726169844
4470296,5,B004UQPM4E,"The original theatrical release of Superman:The Movie and Superman II are included in this set. I bought this set for that reason alone. But neither movie is restored / digtally remastered. I doubt they will ever restore the original theatrical release of either movie.

I already had the restored/expanded blu-ray of Superman:The Movie, so now I have two copies since this box set includes it. I also like Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut. However, I must confess I like the original theatrical release since that's what I saw when I was a kid. I realize Richard Lester did some questionable things, but I remember being 10 and absolutely loving this movie. I watched this movie with my little sister when the local junior high school was showing it (I still don't know why or how!). Some neighbors took us to see it. Richard Lester made it more a kids movie, which I appreciate very much now.

I don't care about Superman III, Superman IV or Superman Returns. I'm sad that they totally used Richard Pryor the wrong way in Superman III. Programming genius? What were the producers/writers/director thinking? I'll never watch any of those movies again.",1399420800,,1155,4.8578680203045685

This import version, however, is missing the movie labels from each disc.  Despite being clearly shown (on the packaging) as having large white titles on each disc, the actual discs are ~missing~ the movie titles (and have blank, red fields instead).  As another reviewer noted, you can see the names of the movies in tiny copyright notices along the edges--not easy to read, but better than absolutely nothing.

crystal clear picture incredible
i also watched superman II lester cut and Dick Donner cut, i prefer the the Dick Donner version myself
but they both have fantastic HD transfers with new 5.1 audio mixes much better than the dvd versions
Superman III again a new HD transfer looks a bit better than the dvd release
 but not as Good as the previous superman films, i think much more care was given to superman I & II
 than the rest of the series
i didn't bother watching 4th superman , the film is ridiculous mainly cause the film was cut short to 90mins
which ruined it more the plot makes no sense it needs all the extra scenes back into the film
but all the Deleted scenes about 30mins of extra scenes are on this superman IV blu-ray disc anyway.
Disc 7 is superman returns which i didn't bother watching either

Disc 8 is extra new special features
1st Documentary is amazing story of superman from the first comic book published til 2006
incredible Documentary about 90mins
2nd Documentary is the Cinematic saga of superman more detailed Doco about all 6 films, goes for 90mins
the first 45mins is all about the making and filming of superman the movie
new interviews with producers Pierre spengler and Ilya Salkind
new interviews with Richard Donner, Tom mankewiez, margot kidder, Marc McClure, Jackie cooper
Sussanah York, Terrance stamp, Sarah Douglas, Jack O'Hallaran and it continues, the list goes on.
there's more detailed info in this Doco
than there is in the making of featurette from the superman 4 disc dvd from years ago
there's a tribute to Christopher reeve and other featurettes
Disc 8 is packed with extras

all the special features from the previous dvd releases are all on this blu-ray collection

4470322,5,B004UQPM4E,"***NOTE: This massive review was originally posted in 2012 on another version of this product (pre-Man of Steel). Due to a Amazon glitch, that page was deleted and all helpful votes lost. Here is the original review in its entirety.***

Amazon really needs to stop blending all of the disparate reviews for one movie together. It's very easy to get confused as to which set has what features, etc. In this case, however, it worked out rather well for me, price-wise.

This Blu Ray set is NOT the four-film ""Complete Superman Collection"" which was released on DVD and contained bare-bones editions of ""Superman"" I through IV, nor is it the ""Christopher Reeve Superman Collection"" which contained special editions of the original four films. No, this is the ""Superman Motion Picture Anthology"" (which was known as ""The Ultimate Superman Collection"" on DVD), the massive eight-disc deluxe set which contains ""Superman"" I (expanded and original theatrical versions) through IV, the Donner Cut of ""Superman II"", and ""Superman Returns"" complete with the original opening, a newer transfer and a slew of bonus features. This version of the product (the version I received, anyway) was from the UK, but that doesn't really matter since Warner Bros. does not region lock their Blu Ray releases (hence the ""Region Free"" in the item's description) and this set is identical to the US version. Amazon lists this set for sale under the correct title of the Anthology as well as under the incorrect moniker of ""The Complete Superman Collection"". Buying this set under this incorrect name saved me about thirty dollars over the properly titled one, so budget hunters take advantage! Now, let's go through these one at a time:

SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE - The first big-budget superhero film and, in many ways, still the best of them. Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz set the template for every other superhero origin movie that has come since. And Christopher Reeve, of course, is still the ultimate film superhero. ""Superman: The Movie"" proved that comic books could be translated to a different medium and be taken seriously, if treated seriously.

The first two discs in this set are devoted to the expanded and original theatrical editions of ""Superman: The Movie"". I like the expanded version of the film just fine, but I grew up on the original version, so I prefer that one. It just seems to move better, and doesn't introduce a lot of head-scratchers like Lois Lane being the little girl on the train in Smallville who witnesses a young Clark running along at super speed (how old are her parents, anyway?). The transfer on this version is a fair bit better than the old Blu Ray release, which I also owned and did not include the theatrical version. There seems to have been more work done on the expanded version's transfer than the theatrical version; there's not so much excessive grain and the colors really ""pop"" on my 51-inch. However, there's not a huge difference overall (the picture on a 30+ year-old film that was a bit soft in parts to begin with is only going to look so good), not enough to make me stop watching the version I love. Sound has been redone in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it really makes a difference to my ears over the old disc, which was given a plain Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track. Just listen to that subwoofer rumble in the opening scenes flying over Krypton. Whoo!! Bonus features are all ported over from the four-disc DVD edition, including the early George Reeves feature, ""Superman Vs. The Mole Men""; none are in hi-def.

SUPERMAN II (theatrical)/SUPERMAN II: THE DONNER CUT - Boy, the comments one could make about this debacle. In the interest of saving time, I'll just cut right to it: neither one of these movies is truly on the level of the first film. I love them (both versions), but it's a fact. With the first movie, you got to see Richard Donner's vision of the character completely realized. But then, of course, the Salkinds got cold feet and dumped Donner (after he had already completed most of the shooting on ""Superman II"", including Marlon Brando's and Gene Hackman's scenes) and brought in Richard Lester to reshape and complete the film. The theatrical version of ""Superman II"" still works well, expanding on the character and mythology of Superman while keeping the action quotient high. The cast is still great and Terence Stamp creates one of the all-time great villains in General Zod. Richard Lester just added a little too much goofy humor for my taste (dude blowing backwards on roller skates, etc.), something that would run rampant in ""Superman III"". Also, there's a certain affection for the characters that is missing from the final product; it all seems a bit workmanlike. And don't get me started on the producers eliminating Brando's footage just to save a few bucks after the first film had already made millions of dollars at the box office. Everything that was good about ""Superman II"" seems to have been sourced from what Donner and Mankiewicz had already planned beforehand.

In 2006, after years and years of fan petitions and requests (a few of which I signed, I will admit), the missing footage from Donner's planned version of ""Superman II"" (including the Brando scenes, which help this version improve immeasurably on the theatrical cut) was found, restored, re-edited and released using John Williams' original music from the first movie. Watching the Donner Cut, you immediately notice how much more he loves these characters, how the movie just feels right in a way that the theatrical version did not. The replacement of the theatrical version's opening action setpiece at the Eiffel Tower is a prime example. Donner's opener, in which Lois jumps out of a window at the Daily Planet in hopes of forcing Clark to reveal himself as Superman and save her, immediately shows the big differences between the two versions: the plot does not drive the characters in the Donner Cut, the characters drive the plot. The Kryptonian villains are treated more seriously and possess real menace (see the scene where they storm the White House). The Donner Cut also benefits from the restoration of the luminous footage shot by the late, great Geoffrey Unsworth, whose work on the sequel was mostly lost to Lester's harshly lit reshoots. There were certain scenes between Lois and Clark where she confronts him over his dual identity that Richard Donner planned to shoot but did not have the chance, so screen test footage was substituted. And that's where it hit me. Therein lay the problem with the Donner Cut: it's not actually Richard Donner's ""Superman II."" It's as close as one can actually get to what could have been the best superhero film of all time in ""Superman II"", but that film does not exist, will never exist. All we have, thanks to the producers' greed and shortsightedness, is a reasonable facsimile with substituted footage and a rehashed ending (Donner and company never got to think up a new ending for ""Superman II"" after using its big turning-back-time climax for the first movie). Lest anybody think I'm just piling the blame on the Salkinds (though they totally deserve most of it), Donner and the driving force behind the project, filmmaker Michael Thau, shoot themselves in the feet by refusing to touch ANY of the Lester footage except where absolutely necessary, which gives rise to some mediocre line readings and bad dubs which were actually improved upon in Lester's theatrical cut (the scene where Superman challenges Zod to a fight at the Daily Planet springs to mind). I can understand Donner's feelings about the project, but a little compromise in this case might have gone a long way. As it is, the Donner Cut is now my preferred version of Superman II, but not by as huge a margin as I might have thought.

Discs 3 and 4 are devoted to the two ""Superman II""s. The transfer on the Donner Cut seems to be the same as the original Blu Ray release, which was pretty good. The theatrical cut of ""Superman II"" (which I've never seen on Blu Ray) fares pretty well and, like the Donner Cut, seems sharper than the first film. Again, the main difference is in the DTS-HD MA sound, which is fuller and more robust than the previously available Dolby Digital 5.1 track. All bonus features were ported over from the two-disc DVD of the theatrical cut and the previously released Donner Cut, respectively. All of the Fleischer/Famous Studios cartoons can be found on these two discs, with the first nine 'toons on Disc 3 and the second batch on Disc 4.

SUPERMAN III/SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE - And here come the sad parts. ""Superman III"" was the first film where Richard Lester had control of the production from beginning to end, and boy can you tell. Overly slapstick-y, negligent of the main characters (poor Margot Kidder is on and off screen in two minutes flat), and worst of all, BORING. How do you make a Superman film BORING?! The only person who comes out of the thing with any dignity at all is, again, Christopher Reeve, who really sells the duality of Superman's character here (including a scene where ""dark"" Superman literally fights Clark Kent in a junkyard). About Richard Pryor, whom I have admired since I was a little kid, I can only say this: as a film actor, he was a terrific stand-up comedian. The only other useful thing to come out of this movie was the computer fraud plot device later referenced in ""Office Space"".

Full disclosure: when I was a kid, the only Superman movie we had on VHS was ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" (God, I know, I know). I heard my dad talking about how terrible it was, but I was a kid and I figured what the heck, it's Superman! So, for a number of years, I had a hard time thinking that it's as bad as everyone says it is. Well, it is, it's terrible. But not as terrible as how Warner Brothers treated Christopher Reeve and the film. ""Superman IV"" was originally supposed to be a big-budget return to form for the franchise. Christopher Reeve came up with an engaging original story (the wisdom of Superman interfering in real-world nuclear politics notwithstanding) and the original cast, including Gene Hackman, would reunite to erase the lingering bad memory of ""Superman III"". Then Warner Brothers slashed the budget and script and shifted the property over to Golan-Globus/Cannon, purveyors of countless '80s cheesefests such as Chuck Norris' ""Missing in Action"" series and ""American Ninja"", and the rest is ignominious film history. Sadly, this would be Reeve's final take on the iconic character of Superman and, needless to say, it's not how his portrayal should be remembered.

Discs 5 and 6 are devoted to these two masterpieces, and they receive better audio/visual treatment than they probably deserve. ""Superman IV"" in particular looks crisp on Blu, all the better to see the cheesy matte lines and wires. Both have DTS-HD MA tracks; ""Superman III"" receives a 5.1 track while ""Superman IV"" is relegated to plain 2.0 stereo. Bonus features of interest include a commentary by co-writer Mark Rosenthal and a bunch of deleted scenes on ""Superman IV"" (ported over from the Deluxe Edition DVD released a few years ago). They're not great, but at least they help to make sense of and flesh out the plot, such as it is.

SUPERMAN RETURNS - Everybody seems to have a different take on this installment, Bryan Singer's homage to/continuation of the original Donner films. Some thought it was too reverent of the original, that Superman was too ""emo"" and that there was not enough action. I personally liked the film, although I think there is probably some validity to those criticisms. I still feel that Brandon Routh was a bit too young to properly portray a more seasoned Superman who has gone through the events of the first two Donner films, but he was pretty engaging in the role, handled the emotional aspects of the role with skill (which, to answer the ""too emo"" critics, OF COURSE Superman is going to be emotional with everything going on in this film, he's not some soulless robot) and generally acquitted himself very well in inevitable comparisons with Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey almost makes you forget Gene Hackman's version of Lex Luthor, edging closer to the malice and insanity of the original character in the comics. James Marsden (who jumped ship on the ""X-Men"" franchise with Singer for ""Returns"") does a good job as Lois' boyfriend, a guy who could believably rival Superman for Lois' affections. Probably the only weak link was Kate Bosworth as a bland, rail-thin Lois Lane who fails in every way to measure up to Margot Kidder's take on the character.

Disc 7 is solely devoted to ""Superman Returns"", and it improves on the original Blu Ray in nearly every way. The transfer on the original disc (one of Warner Bros.' earliest forays into Blu Ray) was, to put it mildly, a little drab. Well, not so on this new transfer! We're talking reference quality here, it's that good. Every color pops and every detail shows; you can see the weave of Lex Luthor's crisp white suits, you can see the fine mesh of Superman's costume and the crinkles in the leather of his boots (and you can also see just how suspect the CGI Superman is during the shuttle rescue). But for once, the DTS-HD MA sound falls a bit short of what was already available on the previous ""Superman Returns"" Blu Ray: a lossless 5.1 PCM audio track. Audiophiles and collectors might want to hold on to their copies for that. Bonus features have been ported over from the original Special Edition DVD release, including a feature length documentary on all aspects of the making of the film. But even better (and probably one of the major reasons I bought this set), we get to see the original fully produced five-minute opener of ""Superman Returns"" in which Superman searches the remains of Krypton for survivors. I don't know why Singer felt the need to cut this opening, especially when it was already shot, scored, edited, the effects completed, and (God, I hate when films do this) some of it was included in the theatrical trailer. It was a terrific opening! I do remember reading an interview some years ago in which Singer spoke of his idea to include the opening in a future theatrical re-release; I guess he overestimated the public's interest in the film, as did Warner Bros., which gave ""Superman Returns"" a $175-million budget. In any case, I'm glad the people who liked the film finally get to see it.

Disc 8 is strictly bonus material and contains ""Look! Up in the Sky!"", the previously released feature-length documentary produced by Bryan Singer on the history of the character, and a brand-new documentary--yet again feature length-- called ""You Will Believe"" which concerns the rise and fall (and future rise?) of the Superman franchise. Both documentaries are in hi-def. Also included are featurettes exploring the scientific basis behind Superman, the comic's mythology, a tribute to Christopher Reeve, and a terrible, terrible old TV pilot, ""The Adventures of Superpup"".

Superman was the first superhero (and if you can't tell by now, my personal favorite--sorry, Batman) in comics, and the first superhero to make the leap to a big-budget, non-camp film. Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, Christopher Reeve and others pushed the boundaries of the character and paved the way for every other comic book property in Hollywood to be taken seriously. It remains to be seen where the character goes next in movies (I have more than a few reservations about the new Zack Snyder film due out next year) but based on where he's been, Superman deserves much cinematic respect. And with this Blu Ray set, he gets it in a BIG way.",1377129600,5,15696,4.827945001858045

4470334,5,B004UQPM4E,"First off let me say I don't know what people are talking about when they say it's the UK or Spanish version. All I can think is that sometimes Amazon associated/merges reviews of similar but different products (ie a DVD release & Bluray, a previous version of a product). I thoroughly examined the packaging and it clearly says US, and not for sale outside the US.

PACKAGING: Very cool. The lid cap slides off breaking away right were the diamond cap of the Superman Logo and the bottom triangle juts out. (the whole logo traves with the lid. The inner packaging is nice, though I do have some long term concerns about the pastic disc holders that are glued to the cardboad packaging. This isn't specific to this product and I haven't had a problem with this product, but have had other box sets start to separate.

THE COLLECTION: Most will agree that the fist two movies are classic and the second two are ehhhh...Well the restoration is great. I do agree with another reviewer that Bluray does bring out some of the limitations in special EFX of the day, but what can you do. Great to see these cleaned up and all bright and new(unlike seeing it on TV where it looks muddy).

AUDIO: I listened to this through a surround system (Bose Acoustimass with an Onkyo reciever if you're curious) and it sounds incredible. I think they did an even better job on the audio restoration than the video.

OVERALL: Big Thumbs up here folks. If you're a fan of Superman or Super Hero movies, how could you not add this to your collection!",1366934400,4,1528,4.52536231884058

The four classics (Yes even the bad ones, humor me ok? lol) along with Returns look and sound great. There are multiple extras ranging from all the standard making of stuff to some early Superman cartoons.
Now for my only gripe about the set. When I opened it the discs weren't marked. With the exception of Returns and the bonus disc, all they have on them is a pic of Christopher Reeve. Normally  that's not worth mentioning but there are two versions of the first two movies. Four's disc is on top of three You're basically flying blind when you choose.

Superman III and Superman IV are there just for completeness in my opinion as they were unwatchable in the theater so being on Blu-ray doesn't help.

The one thing that annoyed me about the package I received was that it appeared to be a South American release.

I know this is a long time to go between getting an item and writing a review. I recently ordered the Harry potter collection off of Amazon UK. I thought it was such a great deal that I thought I would take a look at price differences on other box sets. When I came to The Superman Anthology I noticed a disclaimer that stated Amazon wasn't selling the item anymore because of some sort of issue with the product. Basically you pay for the US version and you receive the cheaper region free version. Well this happened to me... This was just one of those impulse buys for me a year ago that immediately went on my shelf unopened. After discovering this issue I went and checked and sure enough I had the region free version. I don't mind that. They are the same as far as I know. What pisses me off is that I payed $75.00 for it. I contacted Amazon customer support and was offered a 50-60% refund. It was a nice gesture but, if I were to take the refund it would just about cover the cost of buying another region free set off of Amazon UK lol. No point really. I asked for a credit for the difference and was denied. If you want this Item I would suggest either trying to find it in store and paying the $75/$85 for the US version or just buying the Region free version directly from Amazon UK.

I may shell out another $75 if I find it in a store somewhere and can see with my own eyes it's the US version before I pay for it but I will not attempt to buy it online again. I haven't watched any of them yet but from what I can tell it's the same exact stuff just in a different package and the printing on the discs are different. If anyone knows otherwise please comment because I would like to know. I know it's my fault for not noticing/understanding the difference when I purchased this anthology a year ago. If I would have caught it then I could have easily returned it and gotten a full refund. It's too late for me to leave seller feedback but shame on the seller: ""Uplifting Deals"" for deceiving people like that. Who's the goose? I AM!

EDIT: After my initial contact with Amazon customer support live chat last night, I received an email today asking if my problem was solved. I replied with a no and was asked for a second chance to try to solve my problem. I wrote my issue down in the comments section and sent it. about 20 minutes later Amazon replied with the following:

""Hello,

4470359,5,B004UQPM4E,"The Superman movies (Reeve) were always a childhood delight, even if the third one is too comedic, and if the fourth one is too much of an attempt to re-make Superman II, and if all of them are dated (the charming saccharine stuff about truth and justice... Ah, for the innocence of those days...).

Donner's vision for the Superman films (1 & 2) were ahead of their time.  Filmmakers did not want to try putting superheroes onto the big screen, out of reasons of credibility.  Yet Donner took the risk, and made a fantastic first outing.

He did shoot the first two movies back-to-back.  Unfortunately, he was fired, and Superman II was partly re-shot.  You can find details all over the internet, and while I overall prefer Donner's vision,  some of Richard Lester's alterations were not bad.  (Do note, the special edition of II is a ""what if"", based on existing footage and screen tests.  It's not HOW his vision would have fully been, especially as the Paris scenes and spinning around the world to prevent time travel would have been eliminated and used elsewhere respectively.

III is Lester's vision, which is a little too campy at times, but still has some substance.  In particular is Ross Webster (in what was originally meant for Lex Luthor) wanting to make kryptonite.  In the comics, the red kryptonite is what makes Superman go berzerk, whereas in S-III the kryptonite is still green (a pity it wasn't red, since Superman looked decidedly suspicious at the green crystal).  III is a mixed bag but is somewhat enjoyable overall...

IV feels like a bad remake of S-II, which is unfortunate as it was great to have the full and proper cast back.  (With Donner's firing, some of the cast left the franchise or had scenes cut down, but they were persuaded back for IV.)  Unfortunately, the mojo just isn't there, and Lex's kid looks is the personification of 1980s fashion (best left unseen unless you're wearing dark sunglasses and coated in SPF-500,000 sunblock...)

Pity 'Supergirl"" wasn't included...

But we've all seen the movies and have varying opinions and I can't hate IV, either.

I could spend a day tackling the extras, which pretty much define ""definitive"".

My package came with Superman II and the Donner Cut both slightly popped out of their packaging, but not enough to be bopping around the case to get scratched, and Blu-Ray discs have a coating to prevent scratching.

The set I bought has the 3D logo emblazoned on the front and seems to be a US release, based on verbiage on the box.  Some have received import sets, but there is no difference - apart from the box design (that I know of).  For the <$60 I paid, I don't care that much.

The sound quality is top-notch, especially given the limitations of the source material used for recording.  As always, John Williams (amongst the others who scored the movies) always set the bar for movie soundtracks high and it's a delight to listen to.

The Blu-Ray quality are sharp, as you would expect.  Details are fine, compression artifacting is minimal, blacks and grayscale contrasts (shadow detail) are very nice, and grain is remarkably limited.  Some grain is good, as too much noise/grain removal strips detail, but for this set they got the balance perfectly.  You will see more grain in multi-layered edited scenes (e.g. blue screen with Kypton in the background in the opening of Superman II).  But compared to other recent releases (which still get high marks for quality control), the level of grain reduction is handled extremely well, especially in live action scenes requiring little post-production layering.

Some scenes do have negative scratches on display - this form of cleanup was well-handled overall, but some got through the restoration process.

And some digital enhancing was used to remove wires... It's nice to see some of this type of editing was put into place, meant to keep true to the original production but to remove gaffes.  They didn't add CGI fluff in the background just for pointless theatrics.

But, especially for III and IV Superman's costume, Clark's denim jeans, and planet Earth were remastered in a teal color rather than the original blue.  This is distracting.  Some of this might be due to the source material and editing means available in the 1980s, of course.  But as some websites pointed out, his outfit had been the proper blue in earlier releases but a deep gorgeous teal for the Blu-Ray release.  So far, it's noticeable but not disconcerting, but if they removed wires from Superman, it would have been cool if they remastered all scenes to show as much uniformity between film elements as possible.

UPDATE EDIT:  I was wrong; Superman II is also afflicted by ""the Man of Teal"".  Color accuracy is incorrect with blues, but the sharpness of the imagery just about makes up for it, IMHO.  I wish the mistake hadn't been made, since I don't think this hue adjustment was deliberately made. Especially as some scenes don't show the change as overtly as others.

Overall, this is a solid set - if you can handle the occasional blue->teal color shift in Superman's outfit, Clark's denim jeans, and Earth in some of these films, then it's a no-brainer.  The overall restoration work, and slew of extras, IMHO, makes this set well-worthwhile despite the technical gaffe.",1353801600,4,5302,4.843333333333334

4470365,5,B004UQPM4E,"I'd been debating on getting this set since it's release last year, simply because (let's be honest)Superman III, IV were incredibly sub par and ""Returns"" was one of the most frustrating film going experiences of my 43 years on this Earth.

That said, I think the first Superman film is the archetype by which all other superhero films are judged (see my review). When Donner was allowed to make his cut of the second film, I was estatic and as much as I loved the Lester film as a kid (I didn't care about directors back then), Donner's cut makes much more sense and has a tone more in line with the first film.

All in all...the big selling point here was the special features. There are LOTS AND LOTS of those and shows a lot of footage unseen in the previous DVD releases.

While ""Returns"" was such a let down to me....I think enough time has passed for me to give it a shot and take it for what it is, a tip of the hat to Donner's film, if not a complete rip-off with incredibly bad decisions regarding sub plots (the whole stalking Lois and illegitimate kid parts in particular). However, Routh had an earnest way about him that was very reminiscent of Reeve and was the best thing about that film. On the other hand, I could go on and on as to why Kate Bosworth was an INCREDIBLY bad casting choice.

As far as the third and fourth Reeve films go, I'll just say that even though III was painful but watchable, 1987's Superman IV was so incredibly bad that it makes Schumacher's Batman And Robin look like THE DARK KNIGHT....and that is saying A LOT. If nothing else, I'll watch it with my teenage son and just rip into it ""Mystery Science Theater"" style. That's always fun.

To sum up. Even though it's price fluctuates up and down and still hovers in the $70-$80 range, it's a great set and has very cool packaging. As a fan, I'm glad I finally pulled the trigger and think I'm going to get a lot of viewing pleasure from it.",1343260800,3,1933,4.328729281767956

Visually, it's the theatrical edition, but aurally it is NOT! This release STILL suffers from that awful new sound mix they did that added a TON of terrible sound effects to augment the original sound effects. Anyone raised on this film, as I was, immediately can tell something is off, and it gets worse the longer the movie goes on.

All the sound effects are overdone and in your face, whereas in the real theatrical edition the sound effects were subtle and effective. Warner Brothers has committed a travesty with this film. They re-did the sound effects for that awful Extended Edition DVD they released 12 years ago, and REFUSE to actually go back to the original master. This ""theatrical edition"" is an insult to the fans and the film. I honestly can not watch this film anymore, the sound effects are so bad they take you out of the movie each and every time.

I'm sure the set is good, it seems to have a lot of stuff on it. But I refuse to pay 80 bucks for a ""theatrical edition"" that is not a theatrical edition. Bad enough you have to buy this whole set just in order to have the original cut, but then once you drop the money you come to find that it is in fact a dupe, a con, a lie.

First of all, I have the UK set.  I have been told that the audio/video quality is the same as the USA set.

I was disappointed in the first Superman movie on Blu-Ray.  The picture just didn't seem that good.  I thought it looked like a lot of scenes were shot in bright light, in the fog (sort of fuzzy).  The scenes were just ""soft"", and not very detailed.  The remaining movies had better video quality than the first.  Video quality wasn't terribly disappointing - I mean I didn't feel totally ripped off like I have felt about some movies on Blu-Ray.

I believe the aspect ratio of all 5 movies is 2.35:1, or 2.4:1.  The bonus disc is 1.85:1, I believe, because it completely filled my widescreen TV.

All 5 of the movies are DTS-HD Master Audio.  Superman 1, 2, and 3 are 5.1.  Superman 4, for some reason, is 2.0. The bonus disc is Dolby Digital 5.1.  Sound quality in the 5 movies is good overall.  When I was watching Superman 3, I was overwhelmed with strong sub-woofer bass, which I didn't remember hearing in the first 2 movies.  Of course, Superman 4, being 2.0, had no sub-woofer sound.  Superman Returns also has some strong sub-woofer bass.

Pausing the movies didn't show a bar graph that shows how much time had elasped and how much time remains, like some movies do.  If you want to listen to the movies in English, with sub-titles off, there is no need to get into the Language menu, because it defaults to English, and there are no English options to choose frome.

I was expecting a better quality when we talk about high definition picture, may be I am so demanding but I like movies and I like the classic the most. Superman has been always one my favorites characters and so the movies. Blu-ray means that the movie per se has to offer you the highest qualtiy possible compared with other sources like the DVD, so the studios have to invest a lot of hours, work and huge budget in order to make an excelent job not just a good job. Old movies are more complicated to re-mastered because the original source could be damaged or lost, but technicians know how to solve this issue.

4470372,5,B004UQPM4E,"Amazon really needs to stop blending all of the disparate reviews for one movie together. It's very easy to get confused as to which set has what features, etc. In this case, however, it worked out rather well for me, price-wise.

This Blu Ray set is NOT the four-film ""Complete Superman Collection"" which was released on DVD and contained bare-bones editions of ""Superman"" I through IV, nor is it the ""Christopher Reeve Superman Collection"" which contained special editions of the original four films. No, this is the ""Superman Motion Picture Anthology"" (which was known as ""The Ultimate Superman Collection"" on DVD), the massive eight-disc deluxe set which contains ""Superman"" I (expanded and original theatrical versions) through IV, the Donner Cut of ""Superman II"", and ""Superman Returns"" complete with the original opening, a newer transfer and a slew of bonus features. This version of the product (the version I received, anyway) was from the UK, but that doesn't really matter since Warner Bros. does not region lock their Blu Ray releases (hence the ""Region Free"" in the item's description) and this set is identical to the US version. Amazon lists this set for sale under the correct title of the Anthology as well as under the incorrect moniker of ""The Complete Superman Collection"". Buying this set under this incorrect name saved me about thirty dollars over the properly titled one, so budget hunters take advantage! Now, let's go through these one at a time:

SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE - The first big-budget superhero film and, in many ways, still the best of them. Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz set the template for every other superhero origin movie that has come since. And Christopher Reeve, of course, is still the ultimate film superhero. ""Superman: The Movie"" proved that comic books could be translated to a different medium and be taken seriously, if treated seriously.

The first two discs in this set are devoted to the expanded and original theatrical editions of ""Superman: The Movie"". I like the expanded version of the film just fine, but I grew up on the original version, so I prefer that one. It just seems to move better, and doesn't introduce a lot of head-scratchers like Lois Lane being the little girl on the train in Smallville who witnesses a young Clark running along at super speed (how old are her parents, anyway?). The transfer on this version is a fair bit better than the old Blu Ray release, which I also owned and did not include the theatrical version. There seems to have been more work done on the expanded version's transfer than the theatrical version; there's not so much excessive grain and the colors really ""pop"" on my 51-inch. However, there's not a huge difference overall (the picture on a 30+ year-old film that was a bit soft in parts to begin with is only going to look so good), not enough to make me stop watching the version I love. Sound has been redone in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it really makes a difference to my ears over the old disc, which was given a plain Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track. Just listen to that subwoofer rumble in the opening scenes flying over Krypton. Whoo!! Bonus features are all ported over from the four-disc DVD edition, including the early George Reeves feature, ""Superman Vs. The Mole Men""; none are in hi-def.

SUPERMAN II (theatrical)/SUPERMAN II: THE DONNER CUT - Boy, the comments one could make about this debacle. In the interest of saving time, I'll just cut right to it: neither one of these movies is truly on the level of the first film. I love them (both versions), but it's a fact. With the first movie, you got to see Richard Donner's vision of the character completely realized. But then, of course, the Salkinds got cold feet and dumped Donner (after he had already completed most of the shooting on ""Superman II"", including Marlon Brando's and Gene Hackman's scenes) and brought in Richard Lester to reshape and complete the film. The theatrical version of ""Superman II"" still works well, expanding on the character and mythology of Superman while keeping the action quotient high. The cast is still great and Terence Stamp creates one of the all-time great villains in General Zod. Richard Lester just added a little too much goofy humor for my taste (dude blowing backwards on roller skates, etc.), something that would run rampant in ""Superman III"". Also, there's a certain affection for the characters that is missing from the final product; it all seems a bit workmanlike. And don't get me started on the producers eliminating Brando's footage just to save a few bucks after the first film had already made millions of dollars at the box office. Everything that was good about ""Superman II"" seems to have been sourced from what Donner and Mankiewicz had already planned beforehand.

In 2006, after years and years of fan petitions and requests (a few of which I signed, I will admit), the missing footage from Donner's planned version of ""Superman II"" (including the Brando scenes, which help this version improve immeasurably on the theatrical cut) was found, restored, re-edited and released using John Williams' original music from the first movie. Watching the Donner Cut, you immediately notice how much more he loves these characters, how the movie just feels right in a way that the theatrical version did not. The replacement of the theatrical version's opening action setpiece at the Eiffel Tower is a prime example. Donner's opener, in which Lois jumps out of a window at the Daily Planet in hopes of forcing Clark to reveal himself as Superman and save her, immediately shows the big differences between the two versions: the plot does not drive the characters in the Donner Cut, the characters drive the plot. The Kryptonian villains are treated more seriously and possess real menace (see the scene where they storm the White House). The Donner Cut also benefits from the restoration of the luminous footage shot by the late, great Geoffrey Unsworth, whose work on the sequel was mostly lost to Lester's harshly lit reshoots. There were certain scenes between Lois and Clark where she confronts him over his dual identity that Richard Donner planned to shoot but did not have the chance, so screen test footage was substituted. And that's where it hit me. Therein lay the problem with the Donner Cut: it's not actually Richard Donner's ""Superman II."" It's as close as one can actually get to what could have been the best superhero film of all time in ""Superman II"", but that film does not exist, will never exist. All we have, thanks to the producers' greed and shortsightedness, is a reasonable facsimile with substituted footage and a rehashed ending (Donner and company never got to think up a new ending for ""Superman II"" after using its big turning-back-time climax for the first movie). Lest anybody think I'm just piling the blame on the Salkinds (though they totally deserve most of it), Donner and the driving force behind the project, filmmaker Michael Thau, shoot themselves in the feet by refusing to touch ANY of the Lester footage except where absolutely necessary, which gives rise to some mediocre line readings and bad dubs which were actually improved upon in Lester's theatrical cut (the scene where Superman challenges Zod to a fight at the Daily Planet springs to mind). I can understand Donner's feelings about the project, but a little compromise in this case might have gone a long way. As it is, the Donner Cut is now my preferred version of Superman II, but not by as huge a margin as I might have thought.

Discs 3 and 4 are devoted to the two ""Superman II""s. The transfer on the Donner Cut seems to be the same as the original Blu Ray release, which was pretty good. The theatrical cut of ""Superman II"" (which I've never seen on Blu Ray) fares pretty well and, like the Donner Cut, seems sharper than the first film. Again, the main difference is in the DTS-HD MA sound, which is fuller and more robust than the previously available Dolby Digital 5.1 track. All bonus features were ported over from the two-disc DVD of the theatrical cut and the previously released Donner Cut, respectively. All of the Fleischer/Famous Studios cartoons can be found on these two discs, with the first nine 'toons on Disc 3 and the second batch on Disc 4.

SUPERMAN III/SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE - And here come the sad parts. ""Superman III"" was the first film where Richard Lester had control of the production from beginning to end, and boy can you tell. Overly slapstick-y, negligent of the main characters (poor Margot Kidder is on and off screen in two minutes flat), and worst of all, BORING. How do you make a Superman film BORING?! The only person who comes out of the thing with any dignity at all is, again, Christopher Reeve, who really sells the duality of Superman's character here (including a scene where ""dark"" Superman literally fights Clark Kent in a junkyard). About Richard Pryor, whom I have admired since I was a little kid, I can only say this: as a film actor, he was a terrific stand-up comedian. The only other useful thing to come out of this movie was the computer fraud plot device later referenced in ""Office Space"".

Full disclosure: when I was a kid, the only Superman movie we had on VHS was ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" (God, I know, I know). I heard my dad talking about how terrible it was, but I was a kid and I figured what the heck, it's Superman! So, for a number of years, I had a hard time thinking that it's as bad as everyone says it is. Well, it is, it's terrible. But not as terrible as how Warner Brothers treated Christopher Reeve and the film. ""Superman IV"" was originally supposed to be a big-budget return to form for the franchise. Christopher Reeve came up with an engaging original story (the wisdom of Superman interfering in real-world nuclear politics notwithstanding) and the original cast, including Gene Hackman, would reunite to erase the lingering bad memory of ""Superman III"". Then Warner Brothers slashed the budget and script and shifted the property over to Golan-Globus/Cannon, purveyors of countless '80s cheesefests such as Chuck Norris' ""Missing in Action"" series and ""American Ninja"", and the rest is ignominious film history. Sadly, this would be Reeve's final take on the iconic character of Superman and, needless to say, it's not how his portrayal should be remembered.

Discs 5 and 6 are devoted to these two masterpieces, and they receive better audio/visual treatment than they probably deserve. ""Superman IV"" in particular looks crisp on Blu, all the better to see the cheesy matte lines and wires. Both have DTS-HD MA tracks; ""Superman III"" receives a 5.1 track while ""Superman IV"" is relegated to plain 2.0 stereo. Bonus features of interest include a commentary by co-writer Mark Rosenthal and a bunch of deleted scenes on ""Superman IV"" (ported over from the Deluxe Edition DVD released a few years ago). They're not great, but at least they help to make sense of and flesh out the plot, such as it is.

SUPERMAN RETURNS - Everybody seems to have a different take on this installment, Bryan Singer's homage to/continuation of the original Donner films. Some thought it was too reverent of the original, that Superman was too ""emo"" and that there was not enough action. I personally liked the film, although I think there is probably some validity to those criticisms. I still feel that Brandon Routh was a bit too young to properly portray a more seasoned Superman who has gone through the events of the first two Donner films, but he was pretty engaging in the role, handled the emotional aspects of the role with skill (which, to answer the ""too emo"" critics, OF COURSE Superman is going to be emotional with everything going on in this film, he's not some soulless robot) and generally acquitted himself very well in inevitable comparisons with Christopher Reeve. Kevin Spacey almost makes you forget Gene Hackman's version of Lex Luthor, edging closer to the malice and insanity of the original character in the comics. James Marsden (who jumped ship on the ""X-Men"" franchise with Singer for ""Returns"") does a good job as Lois' boyfriend, a guy who could believably rival Superman for Lois' affections. Probably the only weak link was Kate Bosworth as a bland, rail-thin Lois Lane who fails in every way to measure up to Margot Kidder's take on the character.

Disc 7 is solely devoted to ""Superman Returns"", and it improves on the original Blu Ray in nearly every way. The transfer on the original disc (one of Warner Bros.' earliest forays into Blu Ray) was, to put it mildly, a little drab. Well, not so on this new transfer! We're talking reference quality here, it's that good. Every color pops and every detail shows; you can see the weave of Lex Luthor's crisp white suits, you can see the fine mesh of Superman's costume and the crinkles in the leather of his boots (and you can also see just how suspect the CGI Superman is during the shuttle rescue). But for once, the DTS-HD MA sound falls a bit short of what was already available on the previous ""Superman Returns"" Blu Ray: a lossless 5.1 PCM audio track. Audiophiles and collectors might want to hold on to their copies for that. Bonus features have been ported over from the original Special Edition DVD release, including a feature length documentary on all aspects of the making of the film. But even better (and probably one of the major reasons I bought this set), we get to see the original fully produced five-minute opener of ""Superman Returns"" in which Superman searches the remains of Krypton for survivors. I don't know why Singer felt the need to cut this opening, especially when it was already shot, scored, edited, the effects completed, and (God, I hate when films do this) some of it was included in the theatrical trailer. It was a terrific opening! I do remember reading an interview some years ago in which Singer spoke of his idea to include the opening in a future theatrical re-release; I guess he overestimated the public's interest in the film, as did Warner Bros., which gave ""Superman Returns"" a $175-million budget. In any case, I'm glad the people who liked the film finally get to see it.

Disc 8 is strictly bonus material and contains ""Look! Up in the Sky!"", the previously released feature-length documentary produced by Bryan Singer on the history of the character, and a brand-new documentary--yet again feature length-- called ""You Will Believe"" which concerns the rise and fall (and future rise?) of the Superman franchise. Both documentaries are in hi-def. Also included are featurettes exploring the scientific basis behind Superman, the comic's mythology, a tribute to Christopher Reeve, and a terrible, terrible old TV pilot, ""The Adventures of Superpup"".

Superman was the first superhero (and if you can't tell by now, my personal favorite--sorry, Batman) in comics, and the first superhero to make the leap to a big-budget, non-camp film. Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, Christopher Reeve and others pushed the boundaries of the character and paved the way for every other comic book property in Hollywood to be taken seriously. It remains to be seen where the character goes next in movies (I have more than a few reservations about the new Zack Snyder film due out next year) but based on where he's been, Superman deserves much cinematic respect. And with this Blu Ray set, he gets it in a BIG way.",1330646400,10,15459,4.826857789513391

were the best in the Series but it was great to watch all the Movies in Blu Ray. Alot of the Extra Features about this Movie Series were quite good. My ranking of the Movies in this series is 1. Superman the Movie-(4 Stars) 2. Superman II-The Richard Donner Director's Cut-(3 and a half stars)
3. Superman II Theatricial Version-(3 Stars)4. Superman Returns-(2 and a half Stars)5. Superman 3-(2 Stars)6. Superman IV-the Quest for Peace-(1 and a half Stars-only for Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman, the Special Effects were poor and the Villian of Nuclear Man was way below average and Cannon spent almost no money to do this film, a Superman Movie is suppose to be a Big Budget Film in my Opinion) But overall the Movie Series and all the Extra's that are included is worth having on Blu Ray.

4470383,5,B004UQPM4E,"Like all the other reviewers I think this is a great set and the films look much better in Blue Ray format than they did in the earlier ultimate editions.
I just want to point out that two of the ""Fleischer"" Superman cartoons: ""Mechanical Monsters"" & ""Billion Dollar Limited"" are partially edited. ""Mechanical Monsters"" retells Superman's origin which was originally only presented in the first Superman cartoon and leaves out the part about Superman having X Ray vision. ""Billion Dollar Limited"" also has a slighty changed opening. If you own the Bosko Video version of the Fleischer cartoons you can spot the differences. Warners included the same edited editions of those to cartoons on the earlier DVD ultimate editions.",1320796800,3,724,5.092436974789916

The packaging is all written in English and you don't notice anything is wrong until you look at the discs and they are in what I assume is in Spanish.  I don't speak it so I'm not sure.  I guess I should have known something was amiss from the ""Cannot be sold to any person under 12"" message written on the box.  Not a standard rating that I am aware of in the United States.  I will now be sending back the 2nd package I received with the same incorrect discs.  They didn't even offer to have someone manually make sure that they pulled the correct item.  They are just telling me all they can do is return my money and they will be removing the advertisement for the product from the website.  I have a feeling after reading how long this issue has been ongoing that they probably won't be removing the item from Amazon until they can get it fixed.  I certainly want the movies.  I love Superman.  But, it's not what I ordered and paid for.

(Though, I do believe they are in small letting along the edges of each disc.) Yes, it's not the end of the world, but I would like to receive the exact product I paid for.  I didn't keep it long enough to discover if there were any other differences.

I did return it and was issued a refund, hence the extra star.  But since enough people have had issue with this, Amazon really needs to stop selling this version.

That's really sad. The Theatrical Cut of Superman is an iconic classic, but the extra stuff that Donner added (the cheesy Lois Lane jokes, the lame ""action"" sequence at Luthor's lair) really detract from the original.

Sometimes cuts are good cuts.

Now, you CAN'T get the original theatrical cut of Superman, unless you have an old Laser Disc player. The original cut was BETTER. Better flow, less stiff bad jokes, and act three really cooked.

It's great that these movies have made it to blu-ray in this great collectors set to enjoy over and over again.  I previously bought the 14 disc DVD set a few years ago so I've pretty much seen all the material but when I found out about this with even better visual and sound enhancement, I had to get it.  The inclusion of the deleted Return to Krypton scene was cool to see on Superman Returns (Even though I'm not a fan of that movie as a whole) but I wish they would've included other scenes that were in previews and clips from that movie.  I also enjoyed the addition of the Science of Superman special.  An interesting and scientific look into just how plausable and reality based Superman's powers and abilities would be.

I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to not clearly label these discs but it was a really stupid idea.  Other than that, this is a great set and a must own for any fan.

UPDATE: I posted that review before I read the others and got through all of the discs (Only watched the first 3).  Seems I too have the Spanish version and I would agree that some of them are less than stellar quality.  In addition, no Green Lantern ticket.  I feel very, very cheated by Amazon and sincerely hope they rectify this situation ASAP and allow all of us who've been deceived to get the proper versions at that price.

UPDATE PART 2: Amazon came through and quickly set my up for a return.  Granted, it will take 4 weeks for me to get my money back, but to their credit, they realized their mistake and corrected it.  In addition, they informed me that they don't have the correct one ins stock at the moment and that's no fault of theirs.  My rating is not for them, it's for the item.  Since the item advertised is not the item sent, I am retaining the 1-star rating.  Until it's corrected, I will keep it that way.  I bit the bullet and went to Best Buy and bought the thing for full price (it's my cross to bear, so don't give me a hard time).

4470400,5,B004UQPM4E,"Superb. Comprehensive. All any fan will ever need.

Extras are fabulous. Multiple documentaries and commentaries with plenty of terrific, fascinating retrospective info that digs deep into what a monumental achievement getting the original 1978 ""Superman"" to screen was, followed by the bizarre downward slide of the series.

And, once and for all, we get the lowdown on how Director Richard Donner and the Producers parted company in such poisonous fashion. Amazing considering they'd just released one of the most popular movies of all time, the progenitor and benchmark for all superhero films to follow.

The mostly diabolical ""Superman IV"" looks nice and crisp on Blu. The commentary by writer Mark Rosenthal dishes on the troubled production - you can tell he's struggling to be gracious. And his bitterness manifests in amusing ways like his utter contempt for poor Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (or more specifically his haircut..) wow, did Pillow beat up Rosenthal for his lunch money or something?

As dreadful as the fourth movie is,  'Superman III' comes off as the most misbegotten of the series. Trashing the spirit and integrity of the character for cheap, flat slapstick humour - humour that had began to seep into Lester's 'Superman II' sequences.

What the Hell was Superman ever doing playing second banana to Richard Pryor? Worst of all, he and the movie simply aren't funny. Apart from the ever reliable Reeve, virtually EVERYTHING that made I & II so memorable is missing.

Ironically, Bryan Singer was so reverential to the Donner original, it became a millstone round his neck that makes 'Superman Returns' a suprisingly dull retread. And it really doesn't pop on Blu-ray like it should.

Here's hoping new director Zack Snyder can make Superman fly high again. The Man of Steel deserves it.",1309737600,19,1812,5.097972972972973
