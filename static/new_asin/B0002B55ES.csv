8025625,2,B0002B55ES,"This cartoon reminds me of the style of cartoons that use to be on CBS Storybreak when I was little. The story and the way the characters look is wonderful, but the way they are animated and voiced seems a little 'off'. I get the feeling if they had had a little more money to make and polish this movie it could be as good as something Don Bluth made (the style of drawing humans reminds me a little of him) or something like Quest for Camelot and be not just a made for tv movie.",1169596800,,481,4.020833333333333
8025626,1,B0002B55ES,"There is absolutely no offensive content in The Tale of Tillie's Dragon -- it's not particularly violent, it's very pro-friendship and understanding, etc. There is only one thing to object to: It's simply a horrible, ineptly made movie.

The animation is jerky and sloppy, the voices are annoying, and the plot is a stale rehash of The Reluctant Dragon and several dozen other, superior stories. Tillie the ""peasant girl"" minces around in a Shirley Temple-style party dress and mary janes, looking like an also-ran from one of those tot beauty pageants. Herman the dragon's voice, appearance, and personality are so irksome that you will root for him to get skewered through the heart -- but of course, you'll have no such luck.

The best thing I can say about Tillie's Dragon is that it really makes you appreciate the accomplishment of a beautifully animated film like The Iron Giant or most of the Disneys. And it's short.",1130284800,2,925,4.885350318471337
