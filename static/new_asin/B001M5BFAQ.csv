8320511,5,B001M5BFAQ,This is a great video of the amazing variety of plants and animals that live in our oceans and other special places. Makes the viewer appreciate the grace and beauty of a different world. A very pleasant way to spend an hour. Perfect video for playing on your big screen TV during conversations with friends.,1271116800,,308,4.618181818181818
8320512,5,B001M5BFAQ,This is the best use of underwater photography I have ever experienced. Rusty did a great job of bringing us up close and personal with the creatures of the sea.  Thanks for the trip and great music.,1247097600,,199,4.378378378378378
8320513,5,B001M5BFAQ,"...will feel as you watch the undersea wonders before your eyes.  Anyone who has dived, or has imagined it, will find this a wonderful meditative experience.  Beautiful film, calm and engaging.",1242345600,,193,5.193548387096774
8320514,5,B001M5BFAQ,"As an underwater videographer myself, and having ordered several of these type products, I have to say that Rusty is not only very well traveled but also brings a sense of flow and visual taste combined with superb camera and editing technique that makes this offering head and shoulders above the rest. Many underwater shooters neglect to use available tools to recreate the vibrant colors and sense of calm fluidity that makes the diving experience so magical. Novice divers, nondivers, and hard core gear-heads will all find something to admire and be inspired by here.",1238630400,3,572,5.031578947368421
8320515,5,B001M5BFAQ,"What makes this a five star DVD, in my opinion, is the diversity of scenery - the program takes you to the undersea realms of Hawaii, Costa Rica, California, La Paz, and several other places where life under the veil of the ocean is celebrated with stunning visuals.  It is thoughtfully composed, beautifully photographed, and paced well.  We found it meditative and very relaxing.

I'd have to respectfully question the two star review by Ten Pence ""Ten.""  Wouldn't one surmise if the program is worthy of being looped, it certainly is worthy of more than two stars?  I digress...  I do agree however that a looping feature would be a pleasant addition.  At nearly an hour, its the perfect length for carving out a break in your busy day to refocus, relax, and re-center your inner self.",1238457600,3,788,4.708029197080292
8320516,2,B001M5BFAQ,"Good quality video, but very short and doesn't have continuos loop option available in main menu so we have to keep restarting it....over, and over...and over.",1238112000,,159,5.153846153846154
