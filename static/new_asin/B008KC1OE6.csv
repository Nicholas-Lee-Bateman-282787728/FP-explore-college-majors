8528627,5,B008KC1OE6,"Long before he had his first & last name switched around, got fired over a necktie, made the words ""YES!"" & ""NO!"" into a catchphrase, and taking anger management classes...Bryan Danielson was known strictly for being one of the best professional wrestlers in the world & this DVD is one of his ""greatest hits"" collections from the Ring Of Honor promotion.

2 Out Of 3 Falls vs. Paul London - Both men kept having early stalemates early while sticking to the code of honor until both men tried to get the mental advantage by psyching each other out with Bryan getting the first big move in the match using the ropes to reverse a hammerlock into his own & dropkicked the arm.  Both men went to mat wrestling & started to get more aggressive with London constantly grinding his headlocks with Bryan already coming into the match with a bad ear while Bryan worked over the midsection & back with holds such as a grounded abdominal stretch & various suplexes.  London began to take higher risk such as a head scissors takeover over the top rope followed by a springboard kick on the apron causing Bryan to go aerial with a suicide dive that took both of them out along with a flying headbutt that he went over half way across the ring to hit.  Both men went more aggressive towards their target points with kicks to the head by London before Bryan worked over London's leg to the point where even the referee had to hold him back from attacking & even used the ringpost to damage it more.  The damage each man took was heavily showing throughout the rest of the contest as their moves at times were hurting themselves just as much or at sometimes even more than their opponent but resulted in one hell of a wrestling match were each fall could have been a separate match in itself.
""The Epic Encounter"" Apr. '03

vs. A.J. Styles - This started out with both men being so aggressive in a grapple that it spilled to the floor with both struggling & ramming each other in to the barricades on the outside to the point where the announcers left to watch the match in the crowd resulting in no commentary for this match.  Styles still tried to wrestle a clean match afterwords breaking clean from a hold only for Bryan to nail him with aggressive uppercuts that kept knocking A.J. down before A.J. responded with a loud enziguri kick & a dropkick that ended up having them bump heads on the way down.  The action continued as Bryan kept having a war of words with a fan at ringside as before he ended up hurting his knee going to the outside with Styles having a heavy target on it using the guardrail to inflict more punishment followed by a figure four.  Bryan only hurting himself more as he went for a enzuguri that only caused him to whip his leg even more but wouldn't back down daring A.J. to hit him harder before taking high risk like a top rope twisting forearm & later a top rope back suplex that landed Styles on his back while Styles got more aggressive himself with 3 heavy clotheslines & going for his Styles Clash while Bryan was trying to get the win himself with a crossarm breaker.  A quality encounter.
""Main Event Spectacles"" Nov. '03

vs. Jay Briscoe - C.M. Punk was on commentary for this match as Briscoe started out & maintained going after Bryan with a grinding headlock & chinlock to the point where Bryan back suplexed him but Briscoe still didn't let go of the hold.  Bryan attempted to work over the shoulder while also exchanging chops only for Briscoe to execute a neckbreaker that looked like he snapped his neck before Bryan was able to execute a strong european uppercut causing Briscoe to resort to dirty tactics such as slapping & spitting on him along with raking the eyes.  This was pretty short (around 10 mins.) & nothing really of note here.
""Final Battle 2003"" Dec. 03

vs. C.M. Punk - This was their first meeting with the special referee being Ricky Steamboat who was having his own issues with Punk over the past couple of weeks.  Both exchanged wrestling early with Bryan working over Punk with unique submissions stretching his arm & twisting his neck while a miscalculation for Punk allowed Bryan to work over his midsection with submissions & stretches before Punk was able to finally counter his offense.  Punk worked over Bryan's back with various holds such as a backbreaker & chinlock while driving the knee in the back while continuing to deliberately breaking the rules right in front of Steamboat who in turn responded with a quick count.  Both men continued to trade momentum with impactful holds like a flying european uppercut, top rope vertical suplex that hurt that ended up hurting both men, submissions by both men, and even a ""YES! NO!"" chant years before both men would be in WWE.  With this being both men's first encounter, it lived up to the hype as far as the in-ring action with the addition of the story behind Steamboat & Punk adding to the match rather than take away from it.
""ROH Reborn: Stage One"" Apr. '04

Survival Of The Fittest Finals vs. Austin Aries - Both men started off hard grappling on the mat to the point where Bryan ended up having a cut above the ear only to rebound catching Aries in mid-springboard with a dropkick to the back before continuing to work over his back with various submissions like the grounded chinlock with his knee into the back.  Aries was able to catch a break & gave Bryan a taste of his own medicine as far as targeting the back while also going aerial with various dropkicks throughout the match from different positions before Bryan was on the receiving end of a suplex to the outside that heavily damaged his knee with Aries continuing to attack including an innovative shinbuster into a backdrop suplex.  Both men continued to battle with various submissions including Bryan's signature ""Cattle Mutaliation"" & Aries with a ""Rings Of Saturn"" with added extra punishment before continuing to hit high impact moves such as a brainbuster & top rope back suplex to the point where Aries began to bleed as well from his chin.  This was a really good contest.
""Survival Of The Fittest"" June '04

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match vs. Austin Aries - This was a different type of match with this stipulation as each individual fall in the match had a 60 minute time limit while C.M. Punk did commentary here as well.  Both men started off with exchanges early & delivering some stiff blows & submissions including a back suplex that ended up hurting both mens necks.  Bryan targeted Aries' midsection with holds like various gutbusters, a unique version of the abdominal stretch, and later another variation of the Anaconda Vice while Aries as well used various submissions including one that had Bryan resorting to biting in order to escape before both men went aerial with Aries' twisting dive & later a moonsault that resulted in a Back Stabber while Bryan was able to execute his superplex that hurt himself, top rope headbutt, and a back suplex from the top rope.  The aggression was turned up with Bryan working over Aries knee & taking advantage of whatever he could on the outside including using the guardrail to the point where he almost kicked a fan when throwing Aries leg into it before using various submissions such as the half crab, figure four with a bridge, and standing leglock.  Aries was able to recover after Bryan ""crashed & burned"" on the outside that had him knocked out for a few moments but ended up not having any luck on his own hurting his own leg with a aerial top rope elbow but worked over Bryan being able to knock him out of the ring with a roaring elbow before an opening allowed Bryan to ruthlessly attack the arm using the ringpost & various stretches including his submission Cattle Mutaliation.  They continued to battle into exhaustion with various counters & aerial offense such a top rope attempt countered into a DDT off the top along such executing such hard hitting maneuvers repeatedly until they were knocked out resulting in what is a high quality encounter that went a long distance (the first fall didn't happen until after 45 minutes) with each fall being so physical that even the referees had to switch out between falls to take a break.
""Testing The Limit"" Aug. '04

vs. ROH Champion Samoa Joe - The announcers pointed it out that despite being one of the ""founding fathers"" of the promotion, this was his first ever shot at their World Championship.  Both men started out with various submissions early with Bryan taking a page from Muhammad Ali (even down to the shuffle) avoiding Joe's offense & making him chase him causing Joe to lose his temper to which Joe eventually responded with a forearm shot that knocked him out, over the top to the floor, and assaulting him in the corner on the outside only for Bryan to be able to avoid a huge hit allowing an opening for him to give a receipt in the corner with running dropkicks to the point where Joe broke the chair he was sitting in.  Bryan took more risk with his offense than he usually does as he was able to keep breaking Joe's momentum including taking Joe down with a strong uppercut but Joe regained the momentum focusing on the midsection to the point where Bryan kept losing his breath & coughing heavily but Bryan get fighting back hammering Joe with double axe handles before Joe came back with crossface & PerfectPlex & Ole! kick.  Joe's legs were heavily targeted by Bryan with holds such as the step over toehold & indian deathlock to the point where it effect Joe himself when trying to apply the crossface causing Joe to go a different direction with impactful hits like the lariat before Bryan kept bringing the offense with holds like the dragon suplex & Cattle Mutaliation.  Another quality contest.
""Midnight Express Reunion"" Oct. '04

vs. Jushin Liger - It should be noted that both men were already scheduled to face each other in a tag match the next night so Liger's partner in Samoa Joe was in his corner while C.M. Punk was once again on commentary.  Both men started out exchanging submissions early as Bryan focused on the knee with various twist & stretches while Liger went towards showing his power such as the surfboard into chinlock stretch along with his high flying.  Bryan got more aggressive as the match went on with holds like headbutt, using the outside guardrails, working over the mid-section with holds like the rear chinlock into grounded abdominal stretch, and pulling on Liger's mask before eventually going towards the arm various times using his Cattle Mutaliation submission but Liger would return the aggression with impactful moves like his Liger Bomb & various brainbusters including one off the top rope.  The match wasn't as long as Bryan's bouts usually are but this was action packed in the time they had.
""Weekend Of Thunder: Night One"" Nov. '04

w/Low-Ki vs. Jushin Liger & Samoa Joe - Joe showcased his superior strength overall causing Bryan to attempt to work over the legs & ankle but kept showing off himself causing Joe to respond with a stiff kick to the back while Liger came in hot executing a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker on both men followed by both men with aerial assaults to the outside.  Bryan & Ki went into the strategy of divide & conquer as they worked over Liger with double teaming such as cheating with abdominal stretches along with trying to take off his mask building up to the hot tag to Joe.  This was like the match with Liger the night before where it didn't go as long as Bryan's matches usually do but it was action packed from start to finish with both teams coming very close to a fall throughout the match.
""Weekend Of Thunder: Night Two"" Nov. '04

Steel Cage Match vs. Homicide - As a side note, we got a little highlight package of how violent this feud got before the match.  Both men started brawling on the outside before the match started with Homicide using a fork & using the cage causing Bryan to bleed before he was able to recover & send Homicide into the cage various times while using weapons of his own like a chair & fork causing Homicide to bleed with Bryan get even more aggressive than usual such as using his fingernails to tear open his cut more.  The violence & hard hits increased with moves like a suplex onto two standing chairs, exchanging headbutts on the top rope, a cutter off the top rope, headbutt off the top of the cage, suplex off the top rope, Homicide's lariat that turned Bryan inside out, and Bryan's longest airplane spin in history.  This was different than Danielson's previous matches which were all about the technical wrestling as this was strictly about aggression & violence more than anything else.
""Final Showdown"" May '05

vs. ROH Champion James Gibson - Both men worked over each other with grounded wrestling early as Gibson got the first big move in with a suplex in the ring to the outside followed by using the guardrails & going back into the ring working over the mid-section before Bryan was able to recover using surfboard attempt while also stomping his knees, a suicide dive to the outside, and giving Gibson receipts for the guardrails followed by focusing on the arm with various holds such as the missile dropkick, hammerlock drop & an armbar stretch.  The match got more competitive as it went on with both men countering each others momentum with various holds like a tombstone, top rope legdrop, guillotine choke, swinging DDT, tiger driver, Bryan's ""Cattle Mutaliation"" and crossface chickenwing resulting in a good competitive match & an important moment for Danielson's career.
""Glory By Honor IV"" Sept. '05

ROH Championship Match vs. Christopher Daniels - Both men had the same strategy as far as working over the others arm early with holds like a stretch armbar & hammerlock before Bryan switched to the legs with a unique leg lock & bridge along with other holds such as the surfboard & a dropkick to Daniels who was tied up causing him to bleed with Bryan being vicious in how he attacked the cut.  Daniels was able to get some offense by going aerial such as the springboard moonsault & crossbody while Bryan took the fight to the air as well with a headbutt before both men worked on submissions like the Cattle Mutaliation & cogi clutch along with other hard hits like the B.M.E. & roaring elbow.  I wouldn't consider this match to be a classic encounter but still delivered good quality.
""A Night Of Tribute"" Nov. '05

ROH Championship Match vs. Naomichi Marufuji - An international challenger here for Bryan's championship who left his mark early on Bryan with his chest filled with blisters due to his chops before Bryan was able to attempt an early chinlock submission with the leg locking in the arm with Marufuji coming back later with a crossface chickenwing into a dragon sleeper.  Both men exchanged slaps throughout the match while still working over the other with submissions such as a surfboard with the chin wrenched followed by a standing figure four dropped back with a bridge before going aerial with Bryan being caught with a dropkick in mid-air, suicide dive with both men crashing into the guardrail, and a missile dropkick.  Bryan was hit with some hard moves like a baseball slide & springboard dropkick while in the tree of woe but also delivered some himself such as the roaring elbow, dragon suplex, top rope belly to back superplex, and his ""cattle mutaliation"".  With this match having an japanese international flavor, you got what you expected as far as a heavy amount of submission wrestling mixed in with some hard stiff shots.
""Final Battle"" Dec. '05

While Daniel Bryan has delivered some quality performances in WWE (when he's allowed to), a majority of them don't live up to the performances that Bryan Danileson has had in his career before then & this is one set of many that showcases them so (just like the ""Summer Of Punk"" set) I shouldn't have to recommend this to the hardcore Danileson/ROH fans because odds are they already have this set or the matches elsewhere but those who are fans of his in-ring wrestling or curious of his true potential as a babyface & heel character then this is worth it.",1355270400,,16105,4.654103557590701
