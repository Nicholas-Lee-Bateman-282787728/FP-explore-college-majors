8007050,1,B0001610YI,"Imagine one guy, one repeated piece of music, one bluescreen, and some NASA images. Mix in inaccurate narration, inaccurate drawings, a single meaningless project, and what do you have? A DVD to sell to parents who can't find anything similar by Bill Nye.

The host claims that the Earth's varying distance from the sun causes the seasons (which are actually caused by the Earth's tilt). The host claims the sun directs the orbits of the planets like a traffic cop (sorry about that comet, Jupiter). A drawing of Saturn shows rings with vertical thickness, like a wedding ring (Saturn's rings are actually extremely flat).

The single project (not plural as stated on the case) consists of drawing the planets, attaching strings, then attaching them all to a coat hanger. And that reinforces ... what?

I could go on and on. As the old joke goes, this DVD doesn't deserve a grade of 1 star, but that's the lowest grade available. There are way too many good science DVDs for kids to waste a moment with this one.",1106524800,11,1012,4.706214689265536
