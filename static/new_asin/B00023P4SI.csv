2060256,3,B00023P4SI,"My four year old loves the funny things the Chipmunks do in this video. Not scary, just right for little kids. Isn't as enjoyable to watch over and over again for parents like other classic cartoons.",1218758400,,199,4.555555555555555
2060257,5,B00023P4SI,I bought two of the DVD's.  One was for my 7 year old daughter and the other was for my nephews ages 5 & 7.  They were glued.  My daughter has been watching it non-stop.  Her favorite Monster Mash.  She found it to be very funny.,1211846400,,229,3.891304347826087
2060258,5,B00023P4SI,Great collection of Chipmunks and even an Archie cartoon.  My 3 year old LOVES this.,1204588800,,84,4.6
2060259,5,B00023P4SI,This DVD brings back so many memories of when I watched Alvin & the Chipmunks when I was a kid.  I bought this for my son who is 6 years old and he loves it!  What I was impressed with the most was the length of the DVD (almost 5 1/2 hours).  It is a double sided DVD that has two full length Alvin & the Chipmunks movie(s) and the other side has a cute monster movie and several (15 minute or so) episodes of Archie Comics.  Worth the purchase and highly recommended for all those Alvin fans out there!,1202256000,,503,4.0
2060260,5,B00023P4SI,"Ok, for those parents out there who want their kids to see what Alvin and The Chipmunks were BEFORE the new movie, this dvd is a must.  It's full of fun videos sure to please young and old alike. In our house, it's hard to say who likes it more, the man or the kids.  hahahaha",1201564800,2,276,3.9107142857142856
2060261,4,B00023P4SI,"While I hadn't seen the Monster Mash, I knew the others were well drawn and had a dash of humor here and there.  I probably won't watch that particular one again, but enjoyed the Archie episodes, and they are drawn to resemble the comics. I wish both sides of the disk were all Archie and his gang, but the Alvin specials were fun too. I won't wait for Halloween, I'll watch them anytime.",1193702400,,388,4.315068493150685
2060262,5,B00023P4SI,"My kids love Alvin and the Chipmunks, so being able to get two on one dvd plus the extra shows was well worth it.  My sons watch this all the time.",1174694400,,147,3.7419354838709675

8021510,1,B00023P4SI,"I got it specifically for my little sister. The reason why I'm so disappointed, was that it was the right case, but it was a completely different dvd inside. It was an Alvin and the Chipmunks christmas movie. Just be wary when buying this. You may not even get what you payed for.",1464998400,,280,4.30188679245283

8021517,5,B00023P4SI,"This is a great mix from all of the TV classics that i loved as a child. These shows aren't really aired anymore even as re-runs on the TV, so it is brand new material according to my kids. They don't seem to mind the lower and older quality of the production video and really enjoy each of the stories on these DVDs!",1317168000,,317,4.0476190476190474
