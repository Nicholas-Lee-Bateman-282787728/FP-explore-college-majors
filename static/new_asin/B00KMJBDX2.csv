8660117,3,B00KMJBDX2,"My brother and me used to laugh until we cried, when, on a Saturday afternoon, they were playing re-runs, approximately 10 years after their first airing on TV.  The quirkiness of the characters, the left of centre comedy, it all made Green Acres what it was.  A truly well written comedy, by Paul Henning, whom also wrote Beverley Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction.  I really disliked Beverley Hillbillies (as a matter of fact, truly hated it, although, coming from Australia, perhaps I didn't quite understand it).  Petticoat Junction, was more palatable, and who starred Henning's daughter, Linda (the Redhead) in one of the roles as the youngest daughter of Bea Benaderet.  Uncle Sam, played by Edgar Buchanan was a classic.  All three, intermingled with each other, which, worked well....to a point.  It wasn't overdone, which was a fresh relief.

This telemovie wasn't the laugh out loud, pee your pants DVD that I was expecting.  Nor was it the 2 hours.  More like 1 hr 40 mins.  Having said that, I wasn't overly disappointed either.  I loved seeing the old gang back together, and a few extras added in.  But their acting seemed stilted, forced.  I was waiting for them to say something funny, anything at all, but alas, it wasn't forthcoming.

Don't get me wrong.  It wasn't bad (but it goes close).  Return to the Batcave (Batman and Robin) was funny, even ""Return to Mayberry"" had it's moments.  Both were aired in Australia, but not ""Return to Green Acres"".  Go figure, two were played in Oz.

Green Acres was such a classic, so well written, so well so.........everything about it, was so right, so what could be wrong?  Absolutely nothing.

My only wish that if they decide to issue the last three series, I would buy them in a heartbeat.  RELEASE THE LAST THREE SERIES, MGM, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.",1488153600,2,1815,4.821428571428571
