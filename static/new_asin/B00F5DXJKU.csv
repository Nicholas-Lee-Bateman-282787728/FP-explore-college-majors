8612453,1,B00F5DXJKU,"The Snow Queen (Nadia Lanfranconi) is evil with magical powers and lives off of love. She has captured the soul of Kay (Robert Amstler) a soldier in love with Gerda (Iren Levy). The Snow Queen is protected by a snow zombie that can only walk on snow. We also knows that his blood smells bad and if your garment comes in contact with it, it must come off and be washed in the river, no matter how cold it is.

The film also flashes to the present where this area is being researched for its ""biophysical signature"" along with two soldiers hunting each other.

The film doesn't make any sense as does any Rene Perez film, the Ed Wood heir apparent. Some of the characteristics of his films is a flip flop from modern times to the past. He did this with ""Little Red Riding Hood"" as well as ""Alien Showdown..."" and most likely a few other films on my want list. The filming location is Napa Valley and he utilized the same set for ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and a lot of the same people. The funniest aspect in this feature is that the Snow Queen has antlers tied to her head, I mean we can see the leather strings. What was that about?

His actors can't act. He can't write a story that doesn't make sense sober. I watch his films because I can't turn away from a train wreak. The dragons, castle, and armies that appear on the Walmart Phase 4 DVD cover are not in the film.

For some people, might be ""so bad it is good."" A few levels below SyFy/Asylum.

Guide: Nudity (Iren Levy-got to get out the blood, Aurelia Scheppers- sleeps topless, Jenny Allford- needs to shower)

Congrats Rene on getting this into Walmart. $9.96 US

Note to self: When running away from a tracking zombie in the snow, don't hide as they can find you from your tracks",1430092800,,1740,4.319018404907975
