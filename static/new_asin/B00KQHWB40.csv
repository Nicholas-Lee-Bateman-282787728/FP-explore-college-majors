6440410,4,B00KQHWB40,"I love this DVD.  The sets, the dancing and the music are ideal.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because there are no extra features on the CD.  It's not a problem, but I would have liked to see some behind the scene interviews or something.

I highly recommend it!",1417996800,10,277,4.074074074074074

6440412,1,B00KQHWB40,"Boy, 18th century French art was really stupid. I know! Let's make fun of it by staging one of its loveliest and most serious works in a refrigerator!

I've been waiting for a long time for Hippolyte on video--but I won't touch this travesty.",1409443200,14,242,4.5
6440413,5,B00KQHWB40,"This production made me happier than 2 marriages. I thought it was wonderful. It presents a magnificent and engaging spectacle in a truly Baroque spirit. Powdered wigs and historicism could not have achieved that (though there are some powdered wigs among the members of Diana's court in the brilliant act 4 but never mind that.) The time and location are not ancient Greece or Rameau's mid-eighteenth century France. It's hard to place it exactly... much of it takes place in and around a fridge. The prologue presents the open fridge with a lovely pastoral scene produced with broccoli trees, cauliflower clouds and a lemon-slice sun... (but no cellophane flowers or marmalade skies... this isn't the Beatles.) Act one takes place outside the now closed fridge with the followers of Diana engaging in some ritual sacrifices and related blood-bathing. In act two we visit hell behind the fridge - this act is very gothic with red-faced furies poking out from the back of the fridge and spidery Fates forecasting doom. In act three the fridge has been transformed into a 1970's looking British home for the intimate scene between Phaedra and Hippolytus (it's always difficult to broach a conversation about one's incestuous love and this one goes even worse than one might expect...) The compartmentalized home with the front wall removed was a stroke of genius. We get to see all the characters brooding about their fate and circumstances in their separate rooms during the whole scene while others are singing their parts (I imagine lots of homes are like this... but without the front wall removed... or the singing.) In act four the fridge becomes one giant room with the bed transformed into a forest for the lovers, Hippolytus and Aricia. The storm comes in through the window and knocks Hippolytus through a hole in the floor to his death. This brings us to act five which takes place appropriately in a morgue with the fridge transformed into a giant cooler for the recently departed. But don't worry, this is French Baroque opera and unhappy endings are not allowed. Racine's unrelenting tragedy is lightened by a little post-mortem resuscitation and all live happily ever after (...well, except Phaedra. Theseus doesn't seem too happy either.) So what to make of the fridge and what is the unifying theme in this production? Places where we get our sustenance, where we live, sleep, eat and die? I don't know. I just know it adds up to one incredible show. The performance of note here is that of Phaedra performed by Sarah Connolly. It is a blistering performance (like everything I've seen her do!) Phaedra, of course, is what this opera is all about just as it was for the plays of Euripides and Racine and Sarah does not disappoint. She is a woman in turmoil to the nth degree. Stephane Dugout also did a wonderful job as Theseus and Ed Lyon presents a very squeaky clean Hippolytus in fine voice. Another standout was Emmanuelle de Negri in several roles including the High Priestess and the Huntress. She nails ""A la chasse"" which was, surprisingly, one of the high points for me. And William Christie is at the podium!! What more could you want? A powdered wig is not going to make this any better.",1408233600,11,3215,4.836660617059891
6440414,3,B00KQHWB40,"Musical values, especially leadership from Christie, as expected, singing and orchestra good.  But really, the production just undercuts the dignity and scope of the intention.  Pitiful.  Some idiot director should be .. well, at least fired.  So disappointing.  I saw Les Arts Florissants production in Brooklyn back in the late 90's, gorgeous, powerful.  This is just trite.  And I love the music so much...",1406764800,21,409,5.296875
6440415,5,B00KQHWB40,"Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie can often feel like a rather dry and academic work of Baroque opera but William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment present a delightful and lively account of the work at Glyndebourne that shows that the elegant rhythms and melodies of the work can actually be sensitive, expressive, witty, thoughtful and movingly tragic.  The 2013 Glyndebourne production also recognises that entertainment also plays a vital role in the presentation of Baroque opera and it's hard to imagine anything quite so spectacular as Paul Brown's designs for this production directed by Jonathan Kent.

Quite why it seems to take place inside and behind a giant fridge may be hard to fathom and likely to come as a bit of a shock to the bewildered viewer. It's at least appropriate to characterise the icy detachment of the goddess Diana by confining her to the ice-box, while a fiery Cupid, whose influence is to cause such havoc to Diana's followers and worshippers, hatches out of an egg - but what on earth are the gods doing in a freezer in the first place and why is Hell depicted in the gunk at the back of the fridge?  Well, in addition to being a classical text, Hippolyte et Aricie is very much a domestic drama. This doesn't always translate perfectly, Neptune's grand entrance not exactly the kind of spectacle it ought to be, taking place in the fish tank of Theseus and Phaedre's tastefully-decorated suburban semi-detached, but it's visually impressive in its own way.

The harmony of the universe has been disturbed by the dispute of the Gods and by the influence of Cupid, and as an opera, in its structure and in its musical arrangements as well as in its subject, Hippolyte et Aricie operates very much on this notion of harmony and the balancing of elements. Rameau - as academic a composer as he might be - makes the case not only structurally and harmonically, but with a sensibility for the beauty of imperfect humans aspiring to be gods.  William Christie fully explores all the melodic and harmonic richness of what Rameau expresses so brilliantly in the musical arrangements, but also balances this with the requirements of the singing. Spectacle (""le merveilleux"") and entertainment (""divertissement"") are other factors that count towards this balance and harmony of all the elements, and that's all there even in the gorgeous but dramatically pointless ballet interludes and in the big and smaller details of the production design.

If the strangeness of the Baroque elements, the dances and the production design don't always fully sustain the interpretation, the singing performances are strong enough to make up for the lack of drive in the latter half of the work.  Stphane Degout is an excellent, richly-voiced Theseus, but it's Sarah Connolly who makes the biggest impression as a simply stunning Phaedre. In addition to being merely a formidable presence, Connolly's performance - alongside Christie's arrangements - also manage to elicit some sympathy for her character's predicament. As Hippolytus, Ed Lyons is perfect for the intentions of this production, his voice delicate but also strong enough to be capable of matching and standing up to Connolly/Phaedra. If he was weaker, this wouldn't work half as well. Christiane Karg however just didn't work for me as Aricie. It can be somewhat of a bland role, but Karg didn't really have anything to enliven it here.

On Blu-ray, this Hippolyte et Aricie looks and sounds every bit as spectacular as the production itself, with a bold colourful video transfer of the performance and crystal clear sound mixes in LPCM 2.0 and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  Aside from the Cast Gallery, there's only one extra feature on the disc, a fifteen-minute making of that covers all aspects of the production, interviewing Christie and Kent, but takes a particular interest into Paul Brown's unusual costume and set designs.  The disc is BD50, region-free, with subtitles in English, French, German and Korean.",1405641600,8,4005,5.018072289156627
8660795,5,B00KQHWB40,"Everything about this opera is appealing.  The choreography, singing, sets, costumes were all first rate.  It stays true to the baroque style throughout.",1464480000,,153,5.608695652173913
8660796,5,B00KQHWB40,"Amazingly, this was the first opera ever called ""baroque"", in its original sense of ""deviant from the classical form"". However, what we get is the most faithful approximation to what the original must have been:  no Eurotrash, but grand spectacle.  Sets, costumes, choreography and, of course, voices.  Lehtipuu, Gillet, Degout and Connolly are masters of the style and deliver with all the dignity and passion the music projects. But the unbeatable combination of Ivan Alexandre as stage director and the glorious Emmanuelle Haim as musical director also deserves the highest praise.  Amazingly, this is my eighth Rameau opera!",1458172800,6,628,5.377551020408164
8660797,5,B00KQHWB40,"Very unusual staging--complely appropriate antique feel to the sets, costumes, sepia lighting, giving the feel of the Baroque era.  Beautiful singing, especially in the choruses, and excellent dancing.  Highly recommended",1454371200,2,221,6.333333333333333
8660798,5,B00KQHWB40,"This is the most beautiful and authentic performance of a Baroque opera I have ever seen. The costumes are exceptional and so are the settings.
The singers are all first class and the Dances are entertaining and adequate. Good for the producers!  There is nothing of the modern routines
of nowadays.",1442448000,10,299,4.862745098039215
8660799,5,B00KQHWB40,"Watching this production was a joy from start to finish.  The staging, costumes, singing, acting, dancing, orchestral playing, and conducting were all superlative!

8660800,5,B00KQHWB40,"I have a whole shelf for DVDs of Rameau operas I've watched once. Often they are beautifully conducted by the gifted William Christie but I cannot abide watching them again. I listen to them but will not view. Why? Because they are the victims of ""Regie Konzept (Director's Concept) Disease."" Beautiful music is playing but some gross distorted bodies are doing ""modern concept dance"".  Squirms and squiggles abound as their bodies are stretched over stumps and lumps and their eyes widen in pseudo-religious ecstasy. There's Zoroastre, Castor et Pollux, Les Indes Galante etc etc. (I also have a bunch of Handel operas afflicted with a similar disease). Trying to convey the art and meaning of the composer and librettist's work appropriate to the spirit of the composition seems to be an anathema to these ""Regies"" Ah! but now along comes our savior Emmanuelle Haim. She and her crew strive to give us this great art in it's native habitat; in it's own reality. Cheers! all 'round.
This opera is a monumental ""Tragedie en Musique"". It is Rameau's first (1733) and probably greatest. It is the worthy product of Rameau and Abbe Pellegrin's adaptation of the Phaedre tragic love story found in Racine's ""Phedre"", Euripides ""Hippolytus"" and Seneca's ""Phaedre"". Early performances of this opera were troubled by the cast finding the work too difficult to perform even after several cuts and alterations. It never reached the popularity of later Rameau works such as Castor et Pollux, Les Indes Galante  or Les Boreades. From 1908 on revivals of the complete Hippolyte et Aricie have gradually attained and affirmed the value of this monumental work. Ms Haim has used the stilted style of sung declamation to emphasize the tragedy of Theseas and  Phaedra. The act three monologue of Phaedra  as she prays to Venus about her guilty love for her step-son Hippolytus  is ""Cruelle mere des amours"" with it's subtle changes of harmony and tempo is one of the most enchanting pieces in all Baroque opera that I know.
The cast is uniformly talented and appropriate to the roles. The sets are gorgeous, subtle and have the feeling of the world of Rameau and Abbe Pellegrin. Ms. Haim is a genius in bringing together these talented instrumentalists, dancers, singers.  set designers, costumers etc to produce a magnificent, successful and beautiful performance. I think Rameau would have been pleased.",1434758400,18,2389,5.035443037974684
8660801,5,B00KQHWB40,"I saw this production at the Palais Garnier, I left thinking that I had seen a major accomplishment. I often see performances that are really good, *but* there is some aspect that was either annoying or just not up to the quality of the other aspects. This is a performance for which there is no ""but"". It was superlative. The DVD is really good. Had I not actually seen the production on stage, I would probably think that the DVD is superlative. It just doesn't quite capture the full richness of the performance. There was just too much happening on stage to be captured by any single sequence of camera shots. The staging was spectacular and sensitive to the period. The orchestra and cast were commensurate. Few baroque performances on DVD attain this quality.

I don't generally like comparing performances unless to compare particular strengths. However, current trends in baroque opera are acutely painful. I saw the original Christie production of this opera when it was at BAM, which was, if recorded, never released. It was sensitive to its period, while executing a large number of contemporary visual jokes (Mercury arrived with a balloon bouquet, Neptune's train was made of seaweed and continued to cross the stage long after Neptune had left, and so forth.) I enjoyed it immensely. The CD from that production is still unparalleled, especially for the trio of les parques. However, Christie's current DVD of this opera may well have set a new standard in uglification. Don't support ugly opera, get this one instead.",1433376000,4,1532,4.937984496124031
8660802,5,B00KQHWB40,"There are three outstanding aspects of this opera dvd: 1) The singers, all of them, give brilliant performances. I want to especially highlight Stephane Degout as Theseus who dominates Act Two (?) which occurs in the Underworld as a helpless hero pleads for the life of his friend. Rameau's librettist does not even attempt to be faithful to the mythological story. What we have instead is the Man of the Enlightenment eloquently arguing for humane behavior even from those with absolute power. Theseus has no special powers or authority beyond this moral appeal. Stephane Degout sings Rameau's gorgeous, sensuous music with the most beautiful baritone tones. I was so taken with his singing that I immediately played Act Two a second time before moving on with the opera. Emmanuelle Haim and her orchestra once again show themselves among the leading artists of the Baroque tradition. Enough said. 2) The production (Thank all the gods and goddesses) is a period production just like the instruments and performance style. No director has distorted the baroque meaning by foisting contemporary mores on the 17th century work. We opera listeners are really smart people: we don't need these anachronistic directors forcing their views on us. WE CAN DO THE WORK OF INTERPRETATION AND CONTEMPORARY APPLICATIONS OURSELVES. Got that! I mean it. I fed up with these ugly contemporary MORALITY TALES. 3) This is one of Rameau's supreme masterpieces. Enough said.",1428105600,28,1456,5.173728813559322
8660803,5,B00KQHWB40,"I recently purchased two DVD,s of RAMEAU's Hippolyte and Aricie. The first; with the GLYNDEBOURNE CHORUS and orchestra OF THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT under William Christie.  The  second; Le Concert D'Astree with Emmanuelle.  First,kudos for William Christie.  He has done much to revive17th and 18th century works and making it attractive to modern audiences. However,I was disappointed Christie performance It appears he tried to make a modern drama out of an old livret. It was difficult to follow In short it was like putting old wine in new bottles.t2222 On the other hand,Emmanuelle Haim uses the dances and actual customs of the period.  The opera was easier to follow and understand. So, I say say that HIPPOLYTE ET ARICIE of the concert D'stree is a superior and I recommend it.",1426377600,18,784,5.0
8660804,5,B00KQHWB40,"This production far surpasses any Rameau operas currently available on DVD in my opinion.  The beautiful sets and costumes are entirely authentic, the dancing is perfect, and the music is utterly ravishing.  What a great pleasure to be able to watch a gorgeous historically informed production unfold.  I have been continuously saddened by a number of other kinky interpretations where Rameau's wonderfully vibrant music has been brutally injured by weird grotesque dancing and barren sets.  This was stunning in every way.  I do agree with the other reviewer that it was disappointing not to be able to enjoy some special features.  Even though I was at home, I still gave it a standing ovation.",1418169600,35,696,5.06140350877193
