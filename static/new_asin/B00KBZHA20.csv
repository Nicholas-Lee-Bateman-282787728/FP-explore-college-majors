8657443,4,B00KBZHA20,"this is a lovely series, my daughter wants to view an episode everyday. Lot of animals present. I love her...",1507075200,,109,4.5
8657444,3,B00KBZHA20,"What you get is 6 episodes on 2 discs, 45 minutes each episode.
There is no menu to choose which episode that you wish to watch.
There are no episode titles.
There are no closed captions.
You'll need to fast forward through everything that you've seen to get to where you want to be if you choose to watch on different occasions.
This was a $30 set, so figure you're paying $5 an episode for a crudely engineered disc with zero conveniences that are common on most $5 Walmart bargain bin discs. National Geographic could have done better.
She is a great vet, some episodes are a stretch (family collecting fishhooks from a stream??) but still entertaining, despite the crudeness of the production.",1501113600,,697,4.67479674796748

8657446,5,B00KBZHA20,"Dr Oakley, Yukon Vet has an absolutely fascinating job; her patients are just 'wild' about her!!  Which is to say, they include moose, caribou,and assorted raptors.  Her greatest pleasure- aside from her family- is to set one of her patients free!  Dr. Oakley is the only vet in her area, which keeps her busy, and requires her to have more than one office.  Her talents include not only veterinary meds, surgeries, and vaccinations, but accuracy with a blow pipe loaded with an anesthetic dart.  I thoroughly enjoyed this program.  I am unable to get National Geographic Wild from my provider, but with programs like this, I get to enjoy the programs I would like to watch.  Great for that 'rainy day'.",1434326400,,703,4.760330578512397

8657448,5,B00KBZHA20,One of my favorite shows.  I found it recently on the NAT. GEO Wild channel when it was offered as a temp. bonus channel.  I upgraded my Dish package just so I could watch it.  The DVD got me caught up.,1421625600,,202,3.8780487804878048
