6677939,5,B00NQFIL0C,"This is a delightful movie. Ok, so it's not a Hollywood production. That's a good thing because this is more like an intimate family movie of the group of wine mavericks who challenged centuries of traditions. These are some of the world's greatest winemakers who set the wine world on fire in the late 1980s - 1990s and are today leading producers of Barolo. Most important title of all for these winemakers, the one they cherish the most, is ""farmer."" I highly recommend this fun divertissement to get to know the likes of Chiara Boschis (the first women vintner in the village of Barolo and engine behind transforming Cannubi hill into an organic zone), Giorgio Rivetti (gentleman farmer par excellence), Elio Altare (whose daughter Silvia possesses his talent and passion for the land) and Roberto Voerzio and many others. One thing to note about an important contribution the Barolo Boys made; their attention to the land and their passion to restore the Barolo terroir to its pristine nature. That was one of the greatest gifts they gave the next generation of Langhe producers who are following the path of the Barolo Boys + A Girl as they move forward to a future from the past.",1446854400,,1186,4.790243902439024

8679787,1,B00NQFIL0C,I tried to watch this movie but the English subtitles don't come on if the person is speaking English. Very frustrating because it looks like a great movie. This area of Northern Italy is so beautiful.,1532736000,,201,4.611111111111111

8679789,2,B00NQFIL0C,The story was good but difficult to understand the broken language.,1482278400,,67,5.181818181818182
8679790,3,B00NQFIL0C,"As a recent visitor to the Langhe, I found the film interesting and thought-provoking,  but following the strands of the battles and the lines of thought in the film, even after watching it twice, can be a challenge.  Still, for fans of Barolo and for people who love the area, some of th footage is lovely, and seeing some of the giant personalities of winemaking can be fun.",1479168000,,376,4.514705882352941
8679791,3,B00NQFIL0C,a little dry unless you're really into wine. mostly subtitles. good story,1473984000,,73,5.166666666666667
8679792,5,B00NQFIL0C,"A very engaging documentary of the (re)volution in the production of one of my favorite wines. It honestly discusses the pros and cons of the importation of wine making techniques from Burgundy that brought Barolo from a cheap little known wine to ""the king of wines and the wine of kings."" Using many first hand interviews with people who lived through it. I'd highly recommend it to any lover of nebbiolo-based wines.",1472860800,,419,4.833333333333333
8679793,3,B00NQFIL0C,Lots of beautiful scenery.  Not sure I really understood the point of the story.,1462752000,,80,4.714285714285714
