746771,5,6303978991,"I teach second grade and have shown this movie after I have read the book (The BFG) aloud to them.  The movie follows the book's storyline, and is a delight for the children especially since they can anticipate what will  happen.  My original tape has become damaged so I was very glad to have  found a replacement at Amazon.com!",923702400,10,329,4.52542372881356

746880,5,6303978991,Dated cartoon but still very entertaining. It is more accurate to actual / original book than the newer Disney rendition of the story. My daughter read a series of Roald Dahl's stories and then we watched both movies to discuss and compare them to the book. Worth the money we spent.,1484179200,,283,4.568627450980392
746881,5,6303978991,"My two and four-year old grandsons love this story, which I recently read to them. Now they ask to watch ithe video when they come to visit and we all enjoy it together. These two little boys aren't intimidated by mean, ugly giants, but if your kids express fear I'd wait until they're a little older to re-introduce the story.",1483920000,,327,4.466666666666667
746882,5,6303978991,I loved the book when I was a kid and this movie is a great adaptation from it. It sticks pretty close to the book. I love it.,1483660800,,126,3.5357142857142856

746888,5,6303978991,This first movie about the very popular book by Dahl is charming and a magnet for children and adults who love its fantasy and simple good and evil. Comparing it to the new Spielberg movie is fun too.,1475452800,,200,4.2894736842105265

746968,5,6303978991,I love this book.  Easy to read,1469059200,,31,3.4285714285714284
746969,5,6303978991,"This movie is an animated film. It follows Roald Dahl's famous story of the BFG and his friendship and love for the little orphan Sophie. The creators of this animated film did a beautiful job of illustrating the development of trust, security, companionship, fun, caring, love and friendship between the giant and Sophie. You will enjoy watching how he learns to take care of this little human in his giant world.

There is danger from the other giants who enjoy eating humans. You will see how Sophie and the BFG's bravery help to capture the ""bad"" giants and put them away for good to protect the humans. In a scene you will note how Sophie and BFG love each other so much they are willing to lose their life to protect the other one.

There is a happy ending. It is a nice family movie, however the animators did a great job in creating the ""bad"" giants, so they may seem a little scary for the young child.

I enjoyed watching this movie and comparing it to the original story.

747084,3,6303978991,"This animated film complements the book, but there's no reason to recommend it otherwise. The animation is jerky, and there's a lot of panning across still background shots. The animators used flashy, blinking lights to illustrate scenes of wonder (e.g., the BFG's dream collection; the bridge to Dream Country), but to my modern eyes, this is a poor attempt to avoid spending the money to actually fill those scenes with wonder. (Budgetary constraints, probably.)

The worst problem is the sound quality. The sound levels are off (I can't explain exactly how), making it difficult to understand the dialog. If you aren't familiar with the story already, you'll have a hard time following the plot because you simply can't hear what's happening. Likewise, during the two musical numbers, it's hard to understand the lyrics. (Aside: why two songs? It's not a musical, so why insert two songs? Based on the quality of those bits, I'd say it was a way to fill some time without spending much of the animation budget.)

The plot differs from the book in some ways, but nothing too major.

So how does it fair with the target audience? My five-year-old, who loved the BFG book, said he liked the movie even better. I noticed that he got bored and distracted during much of the movie, but that's normal for a five-year-old. He enjoyed it so much he watched it again the next day.",1416614400,,1373,4.784810126582278

This one was well done, quite cute and is very reminiscent of the actual book. If you're a Dahl fan, I'd recommend giving this a watch!

One day, I brought it home to watch.  My 3 year old grandson was terrified!  That's when I realized that some of the scenes can be frightening for very small children, especially the scenes with the giants in them.  I was so used to showing it to older children, I didn't think about how it would be perceived by a toddler. :-(  It is a wonderful video and the story is great (as is everything that Roald Dahl writes)!
