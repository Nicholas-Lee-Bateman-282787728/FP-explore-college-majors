8611081,5,B003XTMC6A,"Shaw Brothers films are among some of the greatest martial arts films.
Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre is a famous story written by Louis Cha aka Jin Yong.

This 2 part movie is much like Peter Jackson's 3 part treatment of the Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien.

However, this film was made in Hong Kong many years without computer graphics.
To be fair this work of art is an interpretive crossover from a literary form to a cinematic theatrical style.  As such, the Shaw Brothers version is greatly condensed, and many story elements are exposed in stage, character, and cast choreography rather than explication.  If you look closely, you will spot many familiar faces, and may recognize specific styles and moves when they are being used.

This version of the story jumps straight into the life of Chang Wu Ji and the many women who cross his path.  Although there are opportunities for love, the heroes of this story live as in this poem:
""The World takes over our lives and we can only drift along, existing but not leaving a mark where we go.""

I loved this movie.  At times I had to pause just to think over a scene.  At other times, I couldn't tear myself away.

That being said, I found the Taoist influences in the story-line to be conspicuously absent while Buddhist themes were made prevalent..  For instance the important role of San Feng Chang is barely felt in this version of the story.  ((For comparison watch Jet Li's interactions with the noble character in films Tai Chi Master & Evil Cult))  Also the Wu Tang Clan seems to be much weaker in this version of the story.  While discussing philosophy and religion I might add that the Ming Sect with Persian origins is an interesting idea.  Holy Flame, Sacred Tablets, and 'Altered Universe' Power.  Maybe these concepts come from Mount Sinai?

I think people are lucky to read the manuscripts in original language so that they can understand the stories with their own imagination.",1510876800,,1938,4.686390532544379
