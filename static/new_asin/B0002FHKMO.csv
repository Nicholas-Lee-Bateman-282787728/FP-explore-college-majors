8027849,3,B0002FHKMO,"If you are a Brett Farve fan, this DVD (IMO) sounds better than it is. It is more of Brett Farve in his early years discussing how he might call a play, or what goes on during a play that he looks for, but there is very little in the way of game highlights and no real Brett Farve history. To me it seemed like there was a lot of sanitized fluff and very little meat.

If you are looking for good Brett Farve highlights and Packer videos, you might consider ""Green Bay Packers - Heros"" DVD. There is a great section dedicated to Brett Farve and some nice highlights. There is one funny passage where he is describing his early years and sometime in his second year he asks the back-up quarter back, what 'nickle defense' was, because everyone kept talking about it during film watching and training. They told him and he's like, ""I was just playing the game ...I didn't know what nickle defense was"". Plus other Packer players and highlights too.",1389312000,,946,4.405714285714286
8027850,5,B0002FHKMO,"An enthusiastic young man from Mississippi walked into the frozen tundra of legendary Lambeau Field and has emerged as the ""greatest quarterback the NFL has yet produced.""  Favre is a throwback quarterback with the greatest of abilities.  Only Favre can call and execute plays with such precision.  Montana, Young, Marino were all great quarterbacks but all of them combined could not equal all the guts Favre possesses.  If I were a soldier in a war and engaged on the battlefield I would like for Brett Lorenzo Favre to lead me.",1018569600,2,530,4.855555555555555
