One was for theatres (the long version, with the sex scenes and some other scenes not in the short version) and one was for television (with totally different scenes involving Tina's psychatrist who is photographed from Tina's view on his couch). Both versions should be on a deluxe edition DVD. This is truly a vastly underrated film, with outstanding performances including the Oscar-nominated Carrie Snodgress (now sadly deceased) with Frank Langella, Richard Benjamin, and the rest.

I don't know why Ms. Snodgress never became a superstar.  Having read Sue Kaufman's book, I can state w/confidence that Snodgress got the role of Tina Balser down perfectly. She manages to put up w/truly hideous people--husband, lover, even her kids--w/o coming across as a victim.  An interesting point, as pointed out in another review, is ""mad"" meant as ""angry"" or ""crazy""?  Probably both.  The fact is, Tina is the only sane one in the movie.

I have often wondered if the ""Mad""in the title refers to insanity or anger. If the latter,Snodgress certainly does have a great deal about which to be angry. Her husband is a pompous,boorish,shallow,insensitive,selfish,egocentric twit,and her two bratty kids are the best advertisement of Planned Parenthood I have ever seen.

1202005,4,B00000F37T,"Once upon a time, a housewife was not a bitchy reality show participant, but a woman who cooked and cleaned and ""made"" a home. Women were expected to do that before Women's Lib came along, and the 70s were the last decade of the traditional housewives. Today, they are given the more politically correct term of ""stay at home mom,"" and men are expected to do their equal share around the home. If you want to understand what the 1970s was like for some women, you'd do well to watch Diary of a Mad Housewife.

It stars Richard Benjamin, who was in practically every movie in the 1970s and then went on to become a respected director, as an overbearing husband who demands his wife be both slave and occasional sexual servant. (The way he says ""roll in the hay"" will make you giggle.) His wife is played by the lovely, gone-way-too-soon Carrie Snodgress -- a great actress, with beautiful doe eyes and a charmingly deep voice. She is named Tina in the film and Benjamin's character is fond of yelling ""TEEN"" often enough to drive both you and her mad. Benjamin's attitude is also wearing off on one of his young daughters who complains in the same manner about things as her father does. Tina puts up with Benjamin, but only on the surface. Inside she is dying. At a party, she meets Frank Langella, who you probably won't even recognize, he was so young and unbelievably handsome back then. He is, sadly, a real snake in the grass -- a lothario writer who emotionally abuses Tina, and they have some kind of emotionally masochistic relationship that she gets her kicks from. Nevertheless they have great chemistry together and you're kind of routing for them to make it. Benjamin's character doesn't notice the affair, because, as Tina puts it, he's just so self-absorbed. An interesting question to ponder is: Does she really love her husband or is she just too scared to leave him? This is the kind of movie you want to discuss for hours afterwards with friends.

There is not much plot here, which is the film's one flaw, but the characterization and acting are just so good, as is the directing by Frank Perry, that you won't care much that nothing seems to happen. I wasn't fond of the ending, but overall, this is a funny and fascinating film that feels more like a time capsule/documentary than a fictional work. I wish they still made movies as interesting as this.",1462665600,2,2373,4.59433962264151

Discovered to my horror that the VHS version I have has omitted some scenes I remember vividly from my old off-air version.  In one, I think at the very beginning, Tina is walking Lulu in Central Park and is nearly assaulted by a vagrant.  When she tries to relate this to Jonathan later, he is typically deaf to her concerns.

In another, also close to the beginning, she is in a discussion with her cleaning lady about Jonathan's particular fussiness of having some of his clothes washed by hand, and the cleaning lady, who is busy having breakfast, explains she doesn't do hand washing.

And in the worst omission of all, Tina comes into Sylvie's room after the Thanksgiving dinner debacle and tells her she is terribly rude and disrespectful and Sylvie cries and hugs her mother, and it is a tender scene that never should have been cut.

I certainly hope a DVD is someday made of this spectacular, brutally honest and funny picture--in its FULL VERSION!",1357344000,9,1192,4.59433962264151
1202092,5,B00000F37T,"""A lay is a lay is a lay."" - George Prager to Tina Balser from ""Diary of a Mad Housewife""

In the late 1960's, MCA studio chief Lew Wasserman could not understand why such movies as ""The Graduate"" and
""Easy Rider"" were such big box-office hits. He was an aging man who didn't have a clue where HIS movie audience
had gone. His production executive, Ned Tanen, on Wasserman's orders, was assigned to find out. They discovered
not surprisingly, there was a whole new generation of young movie-goers who wanted films about real people & real
situations and really didn't care, as well, who was in them. In 1969, Wasserman started a youth division at his studio
with Tanen as its head with the goal to produce films under $1 million, preferably $750,000, with the talent paid scale.
The studios left them alone, production costs were low, and talent was abundant - this is why it became a director's
medium in the late 60's and early 70's. The first two films from Tanen's division were ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" and
""Taking Off"" (from Milos Forman). Carrie Snodgress started her movie career (uncredited) with 1969's ""Easy Rider"". I
have read that the film, ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"", should be MANDATORY viewing for every young engaged couple
(especially the females) before they take that big step into the dark unknown with love-fogged dreams that it will be
""happily ever after"". ""Diary"" is an examination into the cosmopolitan land of the brutally cold, cruel, and phony. ""How
bout a liddle roll in da hay??""  Inexplicably, ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" has never been officially released on DVD. This
classic 1970 Frank Perry film delivers a scathing view into a loveless, rut-filled, emotionally abusive marriage that Tina
Balser (Carrie Snodgress) endures as a wife & mother with two little girls. Her husband, Jonathan (Richard Benjamin),
is not exactly a role model for a wife's dream of ""Prince Charming"". He's a pompous, hyper-critical, belittling, status-
seeking, phony Harvard-educated New York City lawyer who treats Tina like a slave. In desperation, she strays to an
equally abusive, cruel man (fabulous Frank Langella as bi-sexual, narcissistic writer George Prager) for sexual motives
only. The film is absolutely DEAD ON in focusing on the limits (and beyond) of what can happen to a person and what
they must endure when they become trapped in bad relationships. I've always viewed ""Diary"" as a brilliant satire of a
marriage, as this one goes bad, and VERY bad. You really feel Tina's frustration and pain with the manner these two
males in her life treat her, and she just takes their crap to the BREAKING point. With no musical soundtrack in the film
(except for the Alice Cooper band at a party & some brief Christmas shopping carols), there is an almost documentary
effect. There are so many scenes in ""Diary"" (most sad, some with very dark humor) that demonstrate the extent of her
tolerance and reactions. Set during the Christmas season in NYC, even this normally joyful time is portrayed as a grim,
sullen, and cynical experience (Jonathan throwing away the holiday card from his garbage men (they're ""nobodys""), the
bickering, shoving Christmas shoppers downtown, Prager basically THROWING his Christmas gift for Tina AT her, and the
quick, blink-and-you'll miss it shot of old Santa, himself, in a pretty disgusting act.) ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" is among
three classic movies (that examine marriage) that, for me, brilliantly portray the darker and disturbing side of this great
institution (the other two being 1970's, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" & 1999's ""American Beauty"", both Oscar winning
masterpieces). ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" was adapted by Frank Perry's then-wife Eleanor from the 1967 Sue Kaufman
novel of the same name. It was released on VHS/BETA in 1982 & the short-lived MCA DISCOVISION format in 1978, but
never on DVD.  I was able to get a decent quality VHS-ripped DVD online years ago that will have to suffice. Frank and
Eleanor Perry worked together on six films, including his directorial debut, 1962's ""David and Lisa"", a dramatic and poig-
nant box office hit about two institutionalized, emotionally disturbed teenagers which earned Perry an Academy Award
nomination for ""Best Director"".  Perry (1930 - 1995) was known for doing films with subjects involving troubled, disturbing
psychological character studies, including ""The Swimmer"", ""Last Summer"", and the controversial 1981 ""Mommie Dearest"".
Carrie Snodgress (1945 - 2004) received a ""Best Actress"" Academy Award nomination for ""Diary"", along with two Golden
Globe wins: ""Best Actress"" and ""New Star of the Year - Female"". Newcomer Langella was nominated for the Golden Globe
""New Star of the Year - Male"" & won the 1970 National Board of Review ""Best Supporting Actor"" for ""Diary"". Richard Ben-
jamin was nominated for the 1970 Golden Globe ""Best Actor"". ""Housewife"", itself, was nominated for ""Best Picture"" by the
National Board of Review and the Golden Globe. Rocker Neil Young (who was romantically involved with Snodgress after
the film was released) wrote a song called, ""A Man Needs A Maid"" (on his 1972 ""Harvest"" album), after he saw the film
and was deeply affected by Carrie's performance as the withered Tina. His song, ""Motion Pictures"", from his 1974 album
""On The Beach"", was inspired by his relationship with her. In 1990, she revealed, ""I wasn't a rock 'n' roll girl. I said, 'Neil
Young, Neil Young, where do I know that name from?'"" Their relationship ended in 1977, and she returned to the acting
profession, partly for financial reasons (she sued Young for child support). Sadly, Carrie died at the age of 58 from heart
and liver failure while waiting on a liver transplant. ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" received RAVE reviews upon its release:
The Los Angeles Times wrote of Snodgress, ""There is no pleasure for the dedicated moviegoer quite like watching a vivid
new personality light up the screen."" The N.Y. Times said, ""Great movie making!  Superbly theatrical performances!  Carrie
Snodgress will surely receive the critical praise she deeply deserves!"" & foreign critics from abroad called her, ""America's
newest star!"" Roger Ebert said of her, ""What makes the movie work is that it's played entirely from the housewife's point
of view, and that the housewife is played brilliantly by Carrie Snodgress."" Carrie once said, ""I was never really a career
woman, you see. My dream had always just been to do my work well, fall in love and build a life for myself."" She did her
work well, indeed, with the 1970 masterpiece ""Diary of a Mad Housewife""! R.I.P., Carrie. We miss you.",1351900800,8,6619,5.007266121707539

Scenes I remember best were Richard Benjamin sick in bed, yelling ""Tee-nnnaHHHHH"" louder and louder, escalating into a trantrum,  for Tina to drop everything and run to the bedside. His put-downs of her to the bratty daughters, her repellent lover who,after a shower together, finds a pimple on her butt and indignantly suggests she grew the thing on purpose, the shallow, weird NY party goers who steal valuable household knick-knacks from their hosts.

I'd been asked by a number of men to marry them, but whenever I found anything even close to Benjamin's character, I ran. Got married late, but to a good guy.

This is such a good movie that it seems inexplicable that it wasn't issued on DVD as soon as the new format came out. Why, I wonder?",1243382400,8,702,4.535433070866142
1202132,5,B00000F37T,This is one of my favorite films. Because of that I was concerned about the quality of the video. It was excellent and I am watching it.,1240099200,2,136,4.074074074074074
1202133,4,B00000F37T,"Anyone who likes this movie can still get it on VHS from Amazon or eBay, but they cut up the VHS version pretty bad, just so you know.

It's a great movie, as is, but one day, having already seen it on VHS, I then saw it broadcast on a local station that must have had the actual reel to reel and noticed all the cut scenes I never saw. That explained a whole bunch of things I didn't understand. Then I read the book. I kind of went backwards!

BTW, all of you who wanted to know WHY Carrie Snodgrass didn't become a huge star? After singer/songwriter Neil Young saw this movie, he fell in love with Ms. Snodgrass, wrote the song ""Every Man Needs a Maid"" (Harvest), and sought her out. He also kept her at his estate fairly high on marijuana most of the time, and she also had a son with him.

She basically fell off the face of the earth from 1971-1977 and did no acting work, so she missed her ""window of opportunity,"" but according to her, she was fine with that. She worked frequently right up to her death in 2004, but for those 6 years, she did nothing. I believe she left him in 1976. In 1979, Neil Young released the album, ""Comes A Time"" which reflects an obvious breakup he was going through. If anyone can find the Neil Young documentary ""Journey Through the Past"" you will see what I mean. BTW, Carrie is uncredited in that movie, but I don't know if her scenes have been cut since the theater release.

So, the reason she gave up her career for a few years was also the reason I sought this movie out to begin with. She didn't have a very happy life, and from what I read ... not much better than the one depicted in this film.",1229212800,,1641,4.150943396226415
1202134,5,B00000F37T,I just love the sound of Carrie's voice! OK Where is the DVD???? I agree with all the previous comments. Just an adorable film. AND Alice Cooper plays at a party!! Now where is the audio of that scene?,1207958400,3,201,4.17948717948718
1202135,4,B00000F37T,"I have an old copy of this book (it was my 70 y.o. mother's). I have read it numerous times, and enjoyed it. I love how the book depicts life in Manhattan (I am a native NYer). They never show this movie on cable (I look for it). I saw part of it once on late nite t.v. years ago. I would like to see the entire film, I was a small child when it came out, so I did not get to see it in the theatre.  Hopefully they will put it out on a DVD version soon.",1194566400,2,453,3.5757575757575757
1202136,4,B00000F37T,"There aren't all that many false notes in the film DIARY OF A MAD HOUSE WIFE, but the ones that do occur are telling. When an egocentric, extemely misogynistic young writer insults a woman at a party (not the main character, although he insults HER plenty too), she responds, ""I'm going to report you to Women's Lib.""  Now, I won't say that nobody EVER used such an insipid line back then.  In fact, if it were intended as a mildly sassy bit of teasing repartee (i.e. had it been laced with a trace of irony), it might have passed as a kinda-sorta witty comeback (at least in some circles).  But the actress whose line it is gives it a whiny, petulant reading that makes it just plain silly.  It comes off as a particularly dumb and desperate attempt at social relevance.  The screenwriting and directing duo of Eleanor and Frank Perry were not always known for their subtlety, but in this case, the heavyhanded nod to an emerging social movment seems particularly unnecessary.  This movie embodied feminist concerns more successfully than any other film of its immediate era and would have even if the ""feminism"" or ""women's lib"" were never mentioned.

In fact, there will be those who will find the film's unforgiving portrayals of its male characters to be similarly over-the-top, but as a previous reviewer perceptively noted, the film is one Mad Housewife's ""Diary"" and it therefore, by definition, subjective.  The fact that Richard Benjamin and Frank Langella are able to give some human dimension to their otherwise monstrous characters is a saving grace.  Had they been played strictly as written, the film (and its audience) would have suffered for it.

Viewed more than 35 years after its breakthrough release, the film seems particularly prescient.  It addressed Yuppie materialism and shallowness before the term even existed.  There may have been college-aged viewers at the time of the film's 1970 release who might have thought the film was beating a dead horse, that the acquisative and careerist Jonathan Balsers of the world were a dying breed anyway and that ""come the revolution"" their ilk would be long gone.  Little did they realize that by the 1980s they themselves would be outdoing their older brothers and sisters in terms of blind ambition and downright greed.

At the film's close, Jonathan and Tina Balser reflect on their early Kennedy era idealism and wonder just what went wrong.  Their more radically inclined Viet Nam era siblings were likely wondering the same thing by the mid-80s.  In fact, a double bill consisting of HOUSEWIFE and, say, WALL STREET might make for an interesting evening's entertainment.

There was certainly some irony in the fact that the film's much lauded star, Carrie Snodgress, was never able to successfully follow up on this her breaktrhough role.  What happened is subject to some dispute, but by her own admission, she pretty much opted out of a bigtime Hollywood career of her own accord, took up with Neil Young (willingly becoming the ""maid"" that man needed--at least for a time), and pretty much dropped out.  She came back as a character actress in films and on TV, but once commented that the studios weren't willing to bank on her in a lead role after her return from voluntary exile, since by then she was considered too much of a flake.  Hmmm, that would seem to be exactly the same kind of condescension the men in Tina Balser's life showed toward her.

If the fictional Tina Balser was punished for not being a good little wife, it seems the real-life Carrie Snodgress had to pay a price for not being a good little Hollywood actress.

Plus ca change.",1175299200,2,3628,4.827140549273021
1202137,5,B00000F37T,"""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" seems, on its surface, to be a character study of stereotypes.  Richard Benjamin completely over the top as social climbing, acquisitive lawyer Jonathan Balser, who mercilessly criticizes and belittles his wife.  Carrie Snodgress totally passive and reactive as the put-upon, poor little harrassed housewife Tina (albeit in a REALLY spectacular apartment).  Frank Langella a cardboard cutout of a sadistic misogynist.  And yet....and yet.  Thanks to the exquisite talents of the three leads, this film rises above the character-development limits of its script to become a fascinating study of its era (just barely pre-feminist) and of the anatomy of an extramarital affair.  Richard Benjamin IS over the top as Jonathan, but since the story is told from Tina's diary entries and from her viewpoint as his desperately unhappy wife, she would naturally portray him as almost a caricature, his faults magnified to an epic degree.  Viewed from that perspective, his performance is funny, sad, pathetic, and outstanding.  One of his earliest scenes, in which he methodically recites to his wife what she is to pack for his business trip, specifying brand names, colors, and exact amounts, is beautifully done and shows Jonathan at his most jaw-droppingly irritating.  Carrie Snodgress brings dignity and a touch of pathos to Tina, and communicates volumes with those gorgeous, expressive eyes of hers.  The changes Tina experiences as the affair progresses are both wonderful and painful to behold because there is so much truth and naturalness in Ms. Snodgress's performance.  Ah, and Frank Langella....I was only eight years old when this movie came out and didn't see it until many years later, but I can imagine the impact he must have had on female moviegoers at the time -- somewhat equal to the effect he has on ME every time I watch him!  It's easy to call George Prager a classic woman-hating jerk, but like the other two lead characters, that's much too simple.  Frank gives the most complex performance of the entire film, and it's an emotional tour de force, thrilling to watch.  From George's very first appearance at a loud cocktail party where he treats Tina to several nasty criticisms of her appearance, to his first moment of seduction when they meet again weeks later (the quote in this review's title - a truly wonderful line, perfectly delivered in that hushed, velvet voiced way in which Frank Langella has no equal), to the gentle, almost-tenderness of Tina and George's first encounter, to their final, harrowing scene, he dominates the screen with effortless and confident sensuality.  There is a moment, just after the first encounter, where George tells Tina that she'll be like all those other females who think that ""sex -- particularly great sex -- has to be love.""  Tina replies, ""I could never love you...ever,"" and a look crosses his face for a split second that wholly captures the complicated essence of George.  Blink and you'll miss it, but it's a marvelous piece of acting by Frank.  George is an arrogant, self-absorbed, ambitious, sadistic pig, but he's way more than that.  He's also full of self-loathing (surprising at first, but his final scene reveals why), longing (for love and connection, even as he relentlessly drives it away), fear (also revealed in his final scene), and anger (hints at a bad childhood, more fully revealed in the book).  It's a tribute to Frank Langella's talent that he developed George to this extent in view of the script's limits.  ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" is quite of its era on the surface, especially evident in the subplot which culminates in the painfully funny fiasco of the cocktail and cigarette-drenched ""omelette party"".  But the characters, and the wonderfully talented actors who potray them, are timeless, and because of this, it's a marvelous film that transcends its time to become a classic, and one that deserves a wide audience.  Highly recommended!",1150848000,15,3966,5.077041602465331

7906676,5,B00000F37T,"As one enters the rhythm of a marriage, it can develop patterns and pathologies that cause great harm, suffering, and simple boredom.  This film portrays that rough spot with a poignancy so acute that it is hard to watch, yet at the same time manages to be funny at times.  Snodgrass is absolutely brilliant as the long-suffering wife, whose husband appears as a narcissistic twit, unappreciative and careless, smothering her with his demands and yearning to be a player in New York's social scene of the early 1970s.  They are entering mid-life in a full blown marital crisis.

Like many, she seeks what she can't get elsewhere, leading to some hilarious asides in a amazing performance by Frank Langella.  There, we see patterns repeated and some recognition of who she is and what she wants.  Even the husband becomes more three dimensional as a character after this interlude.

It is rare to find a film that really gets me to introspect, to look at my life from another person's eyes and reflect on my own behavior.  This film did that - I thought of an ex from my youth (30 years ago) and wondered if she saw me the way the wife sees her husband in this film.  It shook me and I felt new sympathy for a person I hadn't thought of in years.

Recommended warmly.  This is a great film about marriage as it can become.",1491523200,,1321,4.508403361344538
