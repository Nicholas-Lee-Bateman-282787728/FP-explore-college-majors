8472330,3,B005GTD1OC,"As I strive to achieve higher learning thru cinema, this Bollywood drama, titled AARAKSHAN, came across my DVD player. If I were to believe the majority of Bollywood pictures, then life in India must ever be rife with vibrant colors and epic song and dance and sweeping, passionate romances. And that's cool. I love that. Once in a while, though, a Hindi filmmaker will wander into more thought-provoking territory. He or she will try to shine a light on this or that relevant social issue. AARAKSHAN has something to say about the state of education in India, and it says it strongly enough that its screening was banned in the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra. And since I'm one of them lemmings easily led by star power, this movie was savvy to feature India mega-stars Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and the so very stunning Deepika Padukone.

AARAKSHAN translated means ""reservation."" And here's a quote off the DVD cover: ""Reservation helps the marginalized people to lead successful lives, thus eliminating caste-based discrimination."" Modern-day India struggles still with caste prejudice. And yet the Supreme Court there has just granted a 27% reservation, an affirmative action which reserves even more spots in schools for the lower castes. Except that the affluent and the priveleged scowl at this leveling of the playing field.

The first half of AARAKSHAN is engrossing stuff. In Bhopal, Dr. Prabhakar Anand (Bachchan), wise and idealistic, has been principal to a prestigious college for the past thirty-five years. While other teaching establishments had long ago sold out to greed and almighty profit, Dr. Anand had kept intact the integrity of his institution. But a film always requires a conflict. When does a righteous man bow down to the demands of politics? The Bhopal community is torn over the government's decision on reservation, and this sense of unrest carries over onto the college campus which is populated by pupils from both high and low castes. And when Prabhakar denies admission to an undeserving but politically connected student, it sets off a chain of events that would lead to his own undoing. It opens the door for the oily Mithilesh Singh (Manoj Bajpai), an ""educator"" whose only concern is manipulating the educational system into turning a profit.

There are some really good performances. Amitabh Bachchan, the old master, is formidable yet again; he simply commands the screen and seems to be getting better and better with age. Manoj Bajpai is a natural in front of the camera. He exudes this serpentine quality; you love to hate him. He's so fiendish as Dr. Anand's unscrupulous nemesis. And I'm not sure, but this may be the first time that Mr. Bachchan has shared scenes with another favorite of mine, Saif Ali Khan. Saif plays the low-born Deepak Kumar, Dr. Anand's loyal protg, that is, until caste politics erect a barrier between the two. Deepika Padukone, who's always exhibited dramatic chops to go along with her looks, plays Poorbi. Poorbi is Dr. Anand's daughter, and she happens to be in love with Deepak. When the rift surfaces between the two most important men in her life... well, what's Bollywood without a weepy love story?

AARAKSHAN loses some steam post-intermission, which is why I'm rating it 3 out of 5 stars. It forsakes the central theme of reservation and focuses more on the commercialisation of education. What's that last part, you ask? I'll explain. Mithilesh Singh, the new vice-principal, doesn't much cling to Dr. Anand's values. Singh instead espouses coaching students for a fee, and the film makes this out to be a thriving business. Post-intermission, the film also tracks what befalls Dr. Anand and his family, and this has the effect of lending it a more personal feel rather than keeping the focus strictly on the bigger academic hot buttons. It's too bad. The film would've had more of an impact if only it had stayed on point.

Still, by that time, I'd gotten invested into the characters as much as into the controversial topics. Dr. Anand loses much, but perseveres. And there's something inspiring in those later scenes in which he instructs his downtrodden students in that stable at no charge (even if, okay, those mathematical formulas begin to sound repetitive after a while). AARAKSHAN has its nice bits of dramatic flair. It has its stirring moments. It's a good movie. While lacking the follow-thru that would've made it truly amazing, it's still an important enough movie because it does try to say something. Education should be accessible universally. And worth is not determined by one's station in life. Also, the shallow side of me intends to download that one soulful track ""Achha Lagta Hai.""

This DVD comes with English sub-titles and includes a ""Making Of AARAKSHAN"" featurette (00:56:29 minutes long and mostly in Hindi but with smatterings of English).",1334448000,3,4877,5.022249690976515
