4215702,1,B003X3BYFG,"I will only rate this one star, and here's my reasoning. It is too expensive for only one language. I personally do not like sub-titles. I speak and read American, which is a slang of English so as with One Piece I will wait for the complete release, Japanese and English (dub)languages. Will this stop any hard core collector who wants the first release and maybe is bi-lingual? I hope not, I am simply saying I will wait, thanks for letting me voice my opinion.",1291593600,5,463,4.458823529411765
4215703,3,B003X3BYFG,"Nozumi did an excellent job on video, which is definitely on par with the R2J remastered source that was used. Nozumi actually put fewer episodes on each disc, as the R2J used 6 episodes per disc (18 on the first 3), while Nozumi used 5-4-4. I rate video at a solid 8/10, or maybe  alittle better. No major artefacts, and only minimal dot-crawl in a few places, which you can hardly eliminate without destroying too much detail.

Audio is quite decent. Almost everything is clearly audible with the setup we used, which is Dolby 5.1 through a Sony receiver. 8/10.

Subtitles is the major area where I complain. There are many careless mistakes in spelling and grammar, and inconsistencies in translation, particularly in episode titles, where there will be one title on the case and another in the previews & episode. Nozumi consistently spells the robot's name ""Nanmo,"" even though wikipedia and other sources I checked, and the fansubs, all agree it is ""Nammo,"" which is also how it sounds. A specific example of a grammatical error occurs in episode 3:  ""they say that whoever posses the golem chip..."" ""Posses"" should be ""possesses."" This type of thing happens a lot, and many translations are stilted and awkward - very poor English. Part of a good translation is making sure that grammar is correct and true to the spirit, not the letter, of the original. A literal translation is frequently inaccurate because figures of speech are used much of the time. ""She nearly bit my head off!"" is not meant to be taken literally, for example.

One annoying thing I found. I used a Samsung blu-ray player to play the dvds on my 40"" 1080p HDTV, and found that the menus do not work. A blank screen comes up, and I have to hit ""play"", which takes the dvd right to the first episode. Perhaps it's an incompatibility in the authoring, but this is something that normally does not occur when I play dvds, no matter from what company. I took half a point off for that.",1289520000,4,1959,4.6502890173410405
4215704,5,B003X3BYFG,"Now right after I got this and watched a bit of it I gave a quick 2 line thumbs up but, I prefer to be better when it comes to my anime reviews. If for one reason or another it has taken until now to get the T.V. episodes in the States and this is a great release. If you are a long time fan or want to check out what us old kids are yammering about, DON'T MISS THE ULTRA-DESTRUCTIVE, Kei & Yuri (C/N LOVELY ANGELS) known through the galaxy as, THE DIRTY PAIR!

 This is part one of a 2 part release for the 26 T.V. episodes for the duo and also the very first release in the U.S. for the T.V. episodes and it is definitely a good one. I have the ADV release for the OVA's, Movies, and Flash and the packaging is exactly like the Thinpak boxes for the OVA and Movies, 3 cases get in nice and sturdy chip board boxes with nice art featuring our leading ladies. As for sound and video, It's an 80's classic so you get a stereo mix for sound and it does sound really nice, it looks equally nice wearing it's age well, just don't expect it to look like the latest and greatest out. That all said this looks and sounds great especially for a show produced in 1985.

*A note before I continue, this show is presented in Japanese with Subtitles ONLY, so be prepared there isn't an English Dub!!

 As for the story, it's a sci-fi action saga set in a future universe following the exploits of WWWA trouble consultants Kei and Yuri as they solve intergalactic crimes and mysteries, all while leaving a path of destruction wherever they go, hence the nickname Dirty Pair.
If you are a lover of the classics, or a first time fan, or a long time Dirty Pair fan, don't miss this one!",1374796800,,1670,4.1419753086419755
4215705,5,B003X3BYFG,"Episodes I'd not seen before.  The girls are great, spreading justice and mayhem wherever they go.  Love their personal interplay.  Girls with guns forever!",1367366400,,156,5.416666666666667
4215706,3,B003X3BYFG,The description lists this as Japanese with English subtitles and dubbing.  There is no English audio track.  This package is Japanese with English subtitles only.  I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 4 due to the inaccurate product description.,1358380800,,244,5.205128205128205
4215707,4,B003X3BYFG,"Dirty Pair is old fashioned Anime fun.  It's two Anime heroines spend most of their time getting into and out of implausible scrapes.  When they aren't doing that, they needle each other about their boyfriends.  This isn't intended to be anything serious.  It is intended to be light entertainment, which it accomplishes very well.

Because of the age of the series, the animation is basic, but it is good enough to illustrate the simple stories.

If you're looking for an example of early Anime or you would like something that you can watch with your mind disengaged, I think that Dirty Pair would interest you.  If you would prefer something more serious having a ""girls with guns"" theme, you would like Madlox, Noir or El Cazador better.  Those three DVD's are also available from Amazon.",1356393600,,792,4.814814814814815
4215708,5,B003X3BYFG,"This is a first rate restoration with great clear audio and an amazingly clear and vibrant picture. I use only a simple DVD player, a computer projector and a stretched canvas as a screen, but it was like being in a theatre the first time I showed this disc to my boys. I've now got two new DP converts, who can finally appreciate all of the hidden references to Kei 'n Yuri in US movies and TV SciFi.

The packaging is good and attractive if a tad thin. The transfer is wonderful and the subtitling easy to read with reasonable translations. After almost 30 years of waiting to see these properly done, its nice to understand the girls finally! Well done!",1352073600,,656,4.421487603305785
4215709,5,B003X3BYFG,"Dirty is possibly my favorite anime of all time.  I definitely have a lot of love for Kei and Yuri.  This show is basically 26 episodes of non-stop 80's anime fun.  It really takes you back to a time and place in anime that seems largely forgotten at this point.  A place where strong, sexy female characters, lots of fun, quality hand drawn animation, and a cool scifi setting was enough to make a great and memorable television show.

This show has no nostalgic value to me since I only got into Dirty Pair about five years ago.  So I still think it can be a great show to watch for many audiences that want to see cute strong girls kicking butt.

I think Nozomi did an excellent job on the video.  The remastered picture is quite fantastic looking with great colors, good clarity, and even some original film grain in the image.  It really looks like a legitimate and professional restoration.  The only quibble I can think of is a little ""wobbliness"" in a few parts in a few episodes that can be removed with newer digital tools (I think this remaster is some years old new from the Japanese discs), but over all every thing by far looks excellent.  The audio track is also crisp and clean and delivers some catchy and fun background music.

Over all, I think this is a must have for true blue anime fans!",1324684800,,1309,4.385892116182573
4215710,5,B003X3BYFG,"I first saw this series back in 1984 on a 6th Generation bootleg VHS tape, no subtitles, snowy picture and almost no color.
Yet it, Macross, and Megazone 23 started a life long obsession ""ANIME"" let me tell you drugs would be cheaper!

This DVD set is truly a revelation and a dream come true. Restored video and english subtitles, Life is good!
A note to the those individuals who only watch ""Dubbed"" Anime you are missing out on a legend in Anime, this title will not be dubbed and will only be issued for a limited time so get this one for your collection it is truly a ""Must Have"" for any fan of anime!",1297814400,,606,4.224137931034483
4215711,4,B003X3BYFG,"I first found the Dirty Pair a few years ago on showtime. I immediately went out looking for a DVD release, only to find the newer ""Dirty Pair Flash"" to be the only one available.

Not too much later, ADV released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Original-Dirty-Pair-OVA-Collection-Box/dp/B000BKSJHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Original Dirty Pair: OVA Collection Box</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Original-Dirty-Pair-Movie-Collection/dp/B000B5IOOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Original Dirty Pair: Movie Collection</a>&nbsp;(unfortunately now out of print and quite expensive). These were a great start, but the DVD Collection for the TV show never appeared like I hoped it would, until now at least.

Right Stuf is releasing the series in 2 13-episode parts (3 discs each). The show itself is a fun 80's action/comedy similar to something like Lupin III - overall a very enjoyable show that should have been released years ago.

While the 2-part DVD releases are a bit disappointing with the current trend of releasing single-collection DVD sets, it's much better than what we had even just a few years ago with the individual volume releases for close to the same price as this collection.

I am disappointed that it doesn't have a dub - I found the dub on TV to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the show and would gladly have paid a little more for the set if it meant getting a dub produced. With that said, I'm guessing they're not expecting this set to break records in sales so I can see how they might find it hard to justify producing a dub for it. No point deductions here as this is pointed out on the release (although I was a bit surprised to see that, with how almost ever release over the past few years has had a dub).

It seems the idea of a dub might have been thrown around - the individual cases in the box list ""English and Japanese Language"" for the audio tracks.

For a 25-year-old anime, I thought it looked pretty good. Certainly better than similar titles like Bubblegum Crisis (1987) which had rainbow effects, aliasing and ""marching ants"" at times. The video isn't comparable to modern-day anime, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I'd give it about a 4 out of 5 considering the age. Even on a 50"" TV, upscaled to HD over HDMI, it looks great.

Audio is also clear, but isn't going to blow anyone away or win any awards.

Subtitles are in yellow and white (alternating when needed to prevent confusion from multiple people talking onscreen).

Extras are a bit lacking - while I understand there might not be a collectors-edition worth of extras for a 25 year old anime, this only includes a clean opening credits, trailer for Part 2 and a few other titles. SOMETHING would have been nice, even if it were produced specifically for the DVD release.

The box itself is very nice and includes 3 thin-pack DVD cases inside (each with outer artwork).

If you liked Bubblegum Crisis, Lupin III or any other Dirty Pair releases (OVA's or movies), this one definitely holds up well next to them and gets my recommendation!",1296604800,6,3146,5.101167315175097
4215712,4,B003X3BYFG,one of the best anime never translated to english. it should be noted that is is only subtitled in english. a great series.,1295827200,,123,4.391304347826087
4215713,5,B003X3BYFG,"When this series was original on Japanese television in the 80's, if you wanted to own legit commercially sold videos of it, you had to buy VHS tapes or Laserdiscs imported from Japan.  The VHS tapes each contained 2 episodes and the laserdiscs each contained 3 episodes.  They sold for about $60 U.S. dollars per video.  There were no english sub-titles and no bonus features (besides the clean opening).  Being that this new U.S. release looks at least as good (if not better) than the old laserdisc versions, plus you get removable english sub-titles (reading is good for you, give it a try), plus both sets (once both are available) could probably be purchased for around $65 to $70 together, I find this to be a great deal.

I don't expect an 80's anime show to look like James Cameron's Avatar... get real...

It is what it is.  It's a fun show on a well put together set of discs.  The price has to be what it is most likely for (1) the cost of licensing the material (2) they have to cover the costs of production and still make money off of a disc set which will probably only have limited sales to long time fans of the show.

Many long time anime fans have been eagerly awaiting a U.S. DVD realease of these episodes.  Buy it and enjoy it.  It is a lot better than some of the cheap anime programs (that even the Japanese probably wouldn't watch on TV for free) that some companies are dubbing and dumping on the store shelves as feed for the herds of anime fans that will buy anything.

Honestly, when I received this set, I expected to find things that annoyed me, but I didn't.  As far as I'm concerned, they did everything the way I wanted it.

(p.s.  Did you really expect the DVD's to contain commentary from the non-english speaking cast and staff of the show?)",1292198400,4,1779,4.397553516819572

I saw a review for this on YouTube and the reviewer said that to him it was just 80s nostalgia and that he couldn't see what the fuss was about. But I purchased this set and I really enjoyed them they are  adventure and comedy with interesting stories with just the right amount of Depth to them, I mean there wasn't too much story and there was enough story in each episode to keep me interested right through to the end. Almost each episode was a standalone episode apart from one two part episode on the volume two set. No returning antagonists and each episode felt different and for me each episode was always entertaining. There is almost no Fan Service in this so if you are put off by Fan Service then you don't need to worry and if you are just after Fan Service then I wouldn't recommend it. The animation is still very watchable but it might take a little getting use to after watching some of the latest animation but I think it still holds up pretty well.

Kei and Yuri are the Lovely Angels (or more disrespectfully, the Dirty Pair), a pair of ""trouble consultants"" working for a private corporation, the World Welfare Works Association (WWWA or 3WA), which helps member solar systems deal with planetary-scale problems by dispatching agents like them (for a small fee). Depending on how you look at it, they are either the 3WA's best agents or their worst: because though they always solve the case, solving the case often involves collateral damage on a Biblical scale. It's worth noting that said damage is never technically their fault, but this is usually small comfort to the victims.

01: How To Kill a Computer:  The self-aware master computer running their hometown goes berserk, forcing Kei and Yuri to perform a hard shutdown.  They are going to need a new one, computer that is, not hometown,... yet.  Collateral damage?  One master computer lobotomized, one gargantuan tower holed and tilted like the Tower of Pisa.

02: Do Lovely Angels Prefer Chest Hair?: Kei and Yuri are assigned to investigate a series of terrorist attacks on commercial space liners under the supervision of a senior operative expected to reduce their usual carnage (yeah, right).  Collateral damage?  One space liner crash landed, several skyscrapers decapitated.

03: Go Ahead, Fall In Love!  Love Is Russian Roulette: Kei and Yuri are sent to seize a legendary poker chip that supposedly grants the power of never losing a bet to its possessor.  Collateral damage?  Several cars wrecked, one garden maze permanently ""solved"", one mansion self-destructed.

04: The Chase Smells Like Cheesecake and Death: Kei and Yuri are asked to find a test animal missing from a research lab.  Collateral damage?  Several cars wrecked, one marriage ended on the honeymoon, one hair bank robbed, one subway train diverted into a bank vault, several police cars wrecked, one highway building project delayed by an abortive car chase.

05: Criados' Heartbeat: While on vacation Kei and Yuri are attacked by a rogue space station.  Collateral damage?  One landing procedure violated, one hotel trashed, one police flyer destroyed, one rental spaceship not only not returned with a full tank of fuel but never returned at all, one date seriously delayed.

06: Lot of Danger, Lot of Decoys: Kei and Yuri are just one of the teams helping to sneak a power crystal past a fleet of space pirates, but no worries because who would be crazy enough to send the real crystal with them?...  Collateral Damage?  One space pirate fleet seriously shot up and blown up, one childhood friendship ended.

07: Love Is Everything, Risk Your Life to Elope!!: Hired to deliver the ransom to the kidnapper of a wealthy heir, Kei and Yuri discover they've been lied to, something that tends to end badly for the liars.  Collateral damage?  One botanical museum shot up, one stupid and senseless family quarrel sol... uh, postponed for half a century.

08: Gotta Do It!  Love Is What Makes a Woman Explode: Yuri receives a message from a childhood sweetheart who it turns out is being held prisoner while being forced to build weapons.  Collateral damage?  One secret prison shot up, one secret factory shot up, one joint savings account emptied, one childhood romance terminated.

09: Hire Us!  Beautiful Bodyguards Are a Better Deal: While investigating the murder of 3 3WA operatives on a mining planet, Kei and Yuri turn the situation into a parody of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Fistful-of-Dollars/dp/B00000K0DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Fistful of Dollars</a>&nbsp;by pitting rival syndicates against each other.  Collateral damage?  One mining planet chain reacted.

10: What?  We're Heinous Kidnappers!: Kei and Yuri are hired to protect the young heir of a recently dead king.  Collateral damage?  One dorm room blown to pieces, two air cars shot down, three fighter planes shot down, one caravan wrecked.

11: Ho Ho Ho, Dresses and Men Should Always Be Brand New: As reward for a job well done (it involved blowing things up on purpose), Kei and Yuri are given a much needed vacation and set out to attend a party, but their usual luck keeps getting in the way.  Collateral damage?  One parking lot full of cars shot up, one jail cell totaled during an escape, one bank shot up, one sextet of brats not traumatized nearly enough, one date night wasted.

12: The Little Dictator!  Let Sleeping Top Secrets Lie: Kei and Yuri are asked to clear out an infestation of 3WA headquarters by an army of super intelligent mice in a parody of ""Willard"", ""Ben"", and ""Flowers for Algernon"".  It turns out to have been intended as something of a test before ""something went wrong"", but it is no contest because while the mice might be smarter, NOBODY beats the Dirty Pair for sheer destructiveness.  Collateral damage?  One computer terminal viciously vandalized, one headquarters infested and shot up, two 3WA biological super weapons destroyed.

13: What's This!  My Supple Skin Is a Mess: Kei and Yuri are called in to deal with Lovecraftian nightmares living in the sewers of their hometown.  Collateral damage?  Several sewer workers and a swimming pool full of citizens eaten, one giant sewer system heavily damaged, a smell that tends to linger.

Nozomi Entertainment and Right Stuf! deserve a lot of credit for doing a nearly perfect job of re-releasing an anime classic by marrying remastered video with Japanese audio and English subtitles, all at a reasonable price.
