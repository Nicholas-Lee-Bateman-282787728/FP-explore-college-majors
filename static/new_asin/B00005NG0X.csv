1633490,4,B00005NG0X,"England is the home of Gilbert & Sullivan, so why no English (European) version of this DVD, I'm sure there would be a good market for it.

This is definitely the best DVD/Video of Patience around and is only spoilt by the accent Patience tries to put on. All the other reviews were from America and Canada, so perhaps not used to English regional dialects. I viewed this production with fellow members of the Bath Gilbert & Sullivan Society, of which I am Chairman and we were all of one accord, a superb production spoilt only by Patience's accent, which changed from Lanashire to Yorkshire, then drifted into Wales.

The Grosvenor/Bunthorne duet was fantastic, the dance routine superb, and it was justifiably encored. It was also good to see a live production, warts and all. The incident at the end where Lady Jane accidently knocks Bunthorne over had all of us in stitches, as well as the cast and audience. Such incidents would have been missing from a sanitised studio production. It was also refreshing for us amateurs to see the professionals getting it wrong for once. This production successfully managed to extract all the humour possible from Gilbert's words and was therefore the funniest version I have seen anywhere on stage or screen, amateur or professional.

I would have given it 5 stars, but for that accent, but it was a thoroughly enjoyable performance. When and what is the next one? and can we have it on region 2 please?",1106956800,10,1447,4.756972111553785
1633491,5,B00005NG0X,"From Sydney, a very recommendable Patience.  Bunthorne and Grosvenor, Patience and Lady Jane are memorably played.  The sets and costumes are a delight to the eye, as befits an opera on 19th century aesthetes.  The whole thing is fresh and full of humor:  cast and audience are obviously enjoying themselves tremendously, and the fun is infectious.  After borrowing a copy of this production from the library I went out and bought one for myself.",1079308800,10,446,4.972972972972973
1633492,5,B00005NG0X,"This is the best G and S on DVD. Everything is outstanding - acting, voices, costumes and sets. And Bunthorne and Lady Jane bring down the house whenever they are on. This is probably the hardest G and S to do today but everything is right!",1072224000,13,240,4.239130434782608
1633493,4,B00005NG0X,"Unlike previous Australian Opera  adaptations of Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, this production
does not suffer from lyric substitution (that made obscure references even more obscure to non
Australian audiences).
The sound is very good and the quality of singing is about the best I've heard recorded on DVD (so far).
Unfortunately, there is no closed captioning or sub titles, so following along, for those unfamiliar with this score, can be a challenge.  But everyone, including the chorus, enunciates quite well, so there shouldn't
be too much distress.
I hope there is more coming from Sydney.  It would be nice to have a complete set (as the BBC attempted about 15 years ago). (I wonder if they are forthcoming?).
The quality of production was reminiscent of the D'Oyly Carte one that I caught (and carried in my memory)
in the early 1960's (at the NY City Center).
This is a Must Buy for a true Savoyard!",1013212800,32,910,4.858064516129033
1633494,4,B00005NG0X,"It is fascinating to see an opera company turn their attention to Gilbert and Sullivan. Patience herself is clearly a first-rate singer, and the staging is done with particular care and zest. The choreograpy of the duets and ensembles is a delight to the eye as well as the ear. The one drawback to the performance (that keeps it from FIVE STARS) is the use in the recording of some kind of ""sound suppression"" filter. One of the ""twenty lovesick maidens"" plays a diminuitive pair of cymbals, and whenever she crashes them, the entire sound is suppressed for two or three seconds, until the sound system can recover. This is initially distracting, but is more apparent in the first act than in the second, and should not keep anyone from the superb staging and performance which is given. Bunthorne is played with superb skill by a wonderfully supple character-singer. The twenty minutes which close the second act are for this reviewer eye-and-ear-candy which I play again and again, to delight in the wonderful work of singers, director, and choreographer. Where can we get more of such productions?",1005523200,17,1101,4.893048128342246
1633495,5,B00005NG0X,"I have to admit that I bought this DVD for two reasons: I love Gilbert & Sullivan, and I think that Anthony Warlow has one of the most remarkable voices today. I was more than pleasently surprised by the quality of both the cast and the recording of this production. The voices are all very good (yes, they are opera singers, but hey, get over it - they were in G&S's time, too) and very understandable.  Lady Jane is particularly wonderful.",1003708800,10,441,4.444444444444445

7946888,5,B00005NG0X,"Anthony Warlow and Dennis Olsen are amazing!  Their second act song and dance routine left me gasping.  Christine Douglas is in fine voice and suits Patience perfectly.  Visually appealing, vocally satisfying for the most part.",1405468800,2,227,5.428571428571429

7946891,4,B00005NG0X,"I really enjoyed this production.  For me the stand out was Anthony Warlow as Grosvenor, but the rest of the cast was quite good.  I felt that more could have been done with the Bunthorne/Jane duet in the 2nd act; and while Heather Begg is a 1st rate singer and actress and is a brilliant Lady Jane - her bass playing is a little out of tune.  It was certainly unique to have a Lady Jane who could actually play the double bass - but her playing was so out of tune that the novelty wore off quickly.  The chorus is outstanding as is the orchestra and all of the scenes with the dragoons sparkled.  I highly recommend this performance to any G & S fan.  I agree with another viewer that I hope that eventually Australia Opera will record the entire G&S canon.  The only complete performances available are really very uneven and some are downright poor - with some horrid cuts.  I would love to see this company produce Yeoman of the Guard, Iolanthe and Ruddigore -and make them available on dvd.... pleaseeeee",1268956800,,1009,4.416216216216216
7946892,5,B00005NG0X,"SOURCE: Live performance recorded at the Sydney Opera House in 1995.  The production is based on the 1967 production of the English National Opera (as was the Brent Walker production of 1980, also available on DVD, with which it shares costume designs and many bits of stage business.)

SOUND: Adequate stereo commensurate with the difficulties of capturing a live performance in an enormous box of a theater.

CAST: Patience, the village milkmaid - Christine Douglas (soprano); Reginald Bunthorne, a fleshly poet - Dennis Olsen (baritone); Archibald Grosvenor, poet and apostle of simplicity - Anthony Warlow (baritone); Colonel Calverley, of the 35th Dragoon Guards - John Germain (bass-baritone); Major Murgatroyd - Neil Kirkby (baritone); Lieutenant, the Duke of Dunstable - Graeme Ewer (tenor); Lady Angela - Jennifer Birmingham (soprano); Lady Jane - Heather Begg (contralto); Lady Saphir - Roxane Hislop (mezzo-soprano); Lady Ella - Toni Powell (soprano); Mr. Bunthorne's Solicitor - John Miley (mime).

CONDUCTOR: David Stanhope with the Australian Opera Chorus and the Australian  Opera and Ballet Orchestra.

COMMENTARY: Gilbert and Sullivan's ""Patience, or Bunthorne's Bride"" was their sixth comic opera and it followed immediately after ""The Pirates of Penzance.""

""Patience"" is a story about celebrities, their groupies and their interactions with people who would just as soon not be caught up in the fuss.  As it happens, the show specifically deals with celebrity arising from the English ""Aesthetic"" craze of the 1880s, but that is a mere peg upon which to hang the plot and not even Gilbert's originally intended peg.  If ""Patience"" had been written in the 1920s, it might have been about dashing, record-setting airplane pilots; in the 1930s, radio crooners; or in the 1960s, mop-topped guitar players.

The specific setting is quite irrelevant.  I have performed in three different productions before American audiences who neither knew or cared about the ""Aesthetic Revival,"" but who howled with laughter at the universally recognizable situations and relationships.

The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are creatures of the stage.  The fact that this is a live performance before an appreciative (if sometimes not very swift) audience is an enormous advantage.  In one notable spot, this allows the cast to turn a mistake into a moment of purest gold.

This ""Patience"" is also that rare thing, a recent performance which actually displays respect for both Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music.  There are no imbecilic ""updatings"" or tasteless ""improvements"" to the gags.  There are no pointless additions, lunatic omissions or swinish coarsening of the vocal and orchestral score.  In fact, there is nothing that would excite Sullivan's gentlemanly disdain or Gilbert's sulphuric ire ... except for one dialogue passage.

Gilbert wrote, ""Your conversation must henceforth be perfectly matter-of-fact.  You must cut your hair, and have a back parting.  In appearance and costume, you must be absolutely commonplace.""
In this performance that becomes:
.  BUNTHORNE: Your conversation must henceforth be perfectly matter-of-fact.  You must cut your hair, and have a back parting.
.  GROSVENOR: Beg pardon?
.  BUNTHORNE: Back-parting.  In appearance and costume, you must be absolutely commonplace.
That change is at once so monstrous and so feeble that I can only assume that it is a part of D'Oyly Carte Opera Company performing tradition, a sort of fungus that grew up after Gilbert's death.  I am happy to report that it was received by the audience with stony silence.

Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, were famous for their expensive, sumptuous and technically up-to-date productions.  The first costumes for the chorus of twenty ""love-sick maidens"" were draperies in the high aesthetic style commissioned from Liberty in London.  The women's costumes in this production look almost as though they had come from that original batch.  They are contrasted, as Gilbert intended, with the red coats and gold lace of their former lovers, the men of the 35th Dragoon Guards (a second-class cavalry regiment.)  As massive Lady Jane says in even more massive distaste: ""Red and yellow!  Primary colours!  Oh, South Kensington.""  The two rival poets, Bunthorne and Grosvenor, are even more exotically costumed, as befits their hyper-celebrity status: Bunthorne in the velvet jacket characteristic of Oscar Wilde and Richard Wagner before him, Grosvenor in an outfit suitable for a graduate of Prince Charming University.  The excellent sets are a spikier offshoot of Art  Nouveau, just the sort of thing that Aubrey Beardsley might have designed had anyone been mad enough to entrust him with a commission.

The performances range from acceptable (the Duke and Colonel Calverley, Patience in dialogue) to very good (Lady Angela and Lady Saphir) to downright terrific (Patience singing, Lady Jane, Bunthorne and Grosvenor.)  Christine Douglas certainly had the strongest voice of any Patience since the first complete recordings were made back in the early 1930s.  (What a pity that she never attempted Princess Ida before she shifted her career into directing!)  On the other hand, my English-born wife strongly echoes the objections of an earlier Amazon reviewer about her shifting and improbable accent in the dialogue passages.  Finally, I'll go so far as to say that Anthony Warlow, a major theatrical phenomenon in Australia, is the finest G&S performer ever captured on DVD, just managing to edge out Dennis Olsen for that accolade.  Their scene together is wonderful.

The last half hour of ""Patience"" is a continuous string of comic and musical gems.  In this particular performance, two numbers receive encores.  From the audience reaction, it is perfectly clear that each of those numbers could have been repeated two or three times more (although the exhausted and gasping performers might not have been up to it.)

The Australian Opera production of ""Patience"" is an absolute delight for a hard-core G&S fan and a treat for anyone with the slightest taste for musical theater.

A full five stars (""with a Florentine, fourteenth-century frenzy."")

As I write this, I am shocked to discover that it seems to be out of print (or whatever the proper term might be for a DVD.)  That being the case, I recommend that you snatch it up wherever you lay eyes on it.",1188172800,5,6416,5.302970297029703
7946893,5,B00005NG0X,"Opera Australia has performed a great service by making a video recording of Patience and making it commercially available. Patience, though a hit in Gilbert & Sullivan's time, is largely forgotten today, since the target of the satire, the Aesthetic Movement, is so topical. That is unfortunate, because as Opera Australia demonstrates, the show is a lot of fun and has something to appeal to everyone. Specifically, Patience can be thought of as a satire on cultural fads and the cult of celebrity. For example, toward the end of the show (possible spoilers), after Archibald becomes a ""commonplace young man"" on threat of a curse by Bunthorne, all of his devoted female followers follow suit and disregard their aesthetic demeanor. As Angela explains, ""It means that Archibald the All-Right cannot be all-wrong; and if the All-Right chooses to discard aestheticism, it proves that aestheticism ought to be discarded."" In other words, they are imitating him because he's a celebrity, a phenomenon just as real today as it was then. Besides that, the music in Patience is as good as any Sullivan wrote, and Gilbert wrote some of the most witty dialogue of his career. In short, this is a must-own for any fan of musicals, light opera, and Gilbert & Sullivan particularly, and indeed anyone who is looking for some whimsical fun. Highly recommended.",1180569600,7,1349,5.026785714285714
7946894,5,B00005NG0X,"Patience is actually a tale of celebrity fandom.  You know the sort of thing: a pop singer surrounded by screaming girl-fans - at least until another hot new singer comes onto the scene.  Then the two vain pop singers, jealous of each other's popularity, have a go at each other, using their fans as pawns.  That is the heart of the satire known as ""Patience"".  Except in this story, we have no pop singers, only fashionably aesthetic poets, immitating Wilde, Swinburn an Whister, who were pop celebrities of their own kind in the 1880's.  And in the case of Gilbert's two poets, their true motivation is to get some girls.

Patience, a young dairymaid, is the only girl in town not interested in poets.  Therefore, to one of the poets, she is a distinct challenge, probably to sooth his vanity.  The other poet, who is in love with her, cannot tear himself away from his fans.

The two poets are the stars of this film, as well they should be.  It is a fine production with a fine cast, but Grosvenor and Bunthorne stake their claim from the start and never let it go.  Great for G&S fans, better still for Patience fans.  In many ways, patience is one of the funniest things Gilbert ever wrote, with wierd poetry penned by the master himself.  Enjoy.",1179360000,2,1252,4.511111111111111
7946895,5,B00005NG0X,"I've been fortunate to see this production threee times - twice in Sydney at the Opera House and also in Brisbane where we live. This video recording captures the spirit and liveliness in the theatre very effectively. Olsen (who 'trained' in the the ""Grossmith"" roles with D'Oyly Carte Company in the 60's, returning for an excellent series of G&S in the early 70's with the Australian Opera - If only these were filmed!)is priceless. Recently, when Carl Rosa brought ""HMS Pinafore"" to Australia two years ago, he stepped in at the last minute as Sir Joseph, showing he still had the magic touch. For his Bunthorne alone, as well as Warlow's performance as Grosvenor opposite him, this DVD is well worth the investment.",1172793600,,719,4.853658536585366
7946896,5,B00005NG0X,"This is a marvelous production of a G&S work which deserves to be more often done. What is clearly dispelled here is any notion that the work is mired in its sendup of the Pre-Raphaelites and ""aestheticism"" so that it lacks universal appeal.  On the contrary, it's actually focused on a perpetual human foible, male sexual vanity. Dennis Olsen (Bunthorne) and Anthony Warlow (Grosvenor) have clearly seen this, and they hilariously play self-love to the hilt. Though 19th century poets, they could just as well be 60's longhairs or contemporary rock stars fond of looking in the mirror and being followed by non-critical, lovesick groupies.
The duets between Bunthorne and Lady Jane and Bunthorne and Grosvenor are both first-rate. And when Lady Jane (Heather Begg), in an unexpected stage gesture (whether by accident or design) at last does to Bunthorne what should be done to Bunthorne, the concluding moments become wonderfully comic to cast and audience alike.",1168819200,,965,5.146496815286624
