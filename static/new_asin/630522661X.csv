996086,5,630522661X,"I FIND THAT GEORGE C. SCOTT PORTRAYED GENERAL PATTON EXCELLENTLY JUST AS IN THE ORIGINAL PATTON MOVIE.
IN THIS MOVIE,GENERAL PATTON IS SHOWN EXACTLY AS HE WAS IN LIFE,SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING,AND SOMEONE WHO BUCKED AUTHORITY NO MATTER WHAT THE COST TO HIM WAS.
THE ONE THING IN THE MOVIE I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE IS WHERE HE HAD HIS WIFE DEMONSTRATE AND DRIVE A TANK FOR HIS SUPERIORS.
OTHER THAN THAT,I RATE THE MOVIE VERY HIGHLY.",1059782400,2,469,4.662650602409639
996087,5,630522661X,"Actor George C. Scott delivers an encore performance of his most famous character: Lt. Gen. George S. Patton Jr. Just as the original ""Patton"" was based in part on Ladislas Farago's biography ""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph,"" so too is the sequel based on Farago's second installment of the same title. It is ironic, perhaps that Scott seems tired in this follow-up role and does not deliver a tour de force comparable to his original performance. Then again, the real life Patton was also tired: relieved of command of his beloved Third Army for not being what today would be termed ""politically correct,"" and instead placed in command of a ""paper army"" whose mission was to write the history of the Second WorldWar. Disgruntled with the turn his military career had taken, Patton was to return home, hang up his ivory-handled pistols for good and write a tell all memoir. A day of pheasant hunting in Germany was all that seperated Patton the soldier from Patton the civilian. The out-spoken general never made it. He suffered a broken neck en route in a silly fender-bender with an army 6 x 6 and died of complications twelve days later.  In spite of Scott's subdued portrayal of Patton II, the scenes are superb; the supporting cast top-notch; and the story-line, including the usual amount of dramatic license, holds true to the facts. Throughout the film, the viewer is treated to flashbacks memories of Patton's earlier life as a child, as a young junior officer, and themes the first ""Patton"" dared not touch, such as  Patton's supposed wartime affair with his wife's niece, a woman half the general's age. Unlike the first ""Patton,"" these flashbacks give the film a true biographical feel. I was touched with the strength his wife Beatrice exhibited by her husband's side, reading to him from his favorite books by the likes of Napolean and other great captains while her injured husband lay with a head brace and fish hooks embedded in his scalp in an effort to support his shattered neck. If Scott gave us the mythical ""Patton"" in his first role, he also gave us the human ""Patton"" in his second. This DVD should be appart of the collection of anyone interested in this truely complex individual we have come to know simply as Patton.",1042243200,126,2241,4.7881136950904395
996088,4,630522661X,"Ladislas Farago wrote the definitive biography of General George S. Patton back in the 70's.... which was the book upon which the film with George C. Scott was based.  Even though Patton is a little older, fatter and wiser in this film, it still coveys the historical accuracy of the general's final days.  Scott's portrayal of Patton has lost none of its personality and deserves its rightful place as volume two of the Patton story.",1026000000,6,434,4.773333333333333

996090,3,630522661X,"While this movie is not a spectacular as the original, it is a great movie to watch for those who saw the original. It is a sort of ""anti"" climax to the first, where we see that after the war is over, the work only then begins. Very realistic, and very accurate. George C. Scott's character even refers to his only battle scar, on his buttock, in addition to his boyhood church at San Gabriel. It was hard to watch the medical scenes, that is how realistic it was, with medical equipment reflecting the accurate time era. It is too bad that the DVD has no extra features, other than chapter selections.",1003708800,2,602,4.383928571428571
996091,5,630522661X,"George C. Scott returns as George S. Patton in this sequal to Patton. The movie starts after World War II and shows how he could not adjust to his  peacetime role as military governor of Bavaria. Then he gets in more  trouble when he lobbies for war against the Soviet Union and gets stripped  of his command. And their is the mystery surrounding Patton's death.
George C. Scott does a great job in his portrayal of one of the great  military leaders of the 20th century. I think it is a good buy for people  who like Patton or who like movies dealing with World War II.",966643200,43,570,4.289719626168225
996092,3,630522661X,"I recently purchased a copy of THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON. I was a fan of George C Scott and his works since a I saw Patton some years ago and I was pleased by Scott's reprised role of OL BLOOD & GUTS the movie goes into  detail about the months after Germany surrenders and the US rebuilding of  Germany. The movie is a source of information, but when Patton is involved  in a fatal car wreck the movie goes down hill, because all u c is Patton  layin a bed for a 1 and a half havin flashbacks of him during his youth, it  is one of the longest deaths scenes in history",961804800,2,567,3.93859649122807

996224,4,630522661X,"Extremely interesting movie from a historical perspective - I knew General Patton had dies in car accident, but was surprised to see exactly how it actually happened. I somehow had a different scenario in my mind. The accident itself didn't look very bad at all and it is true that no one else in the car was seriously hurt - including the dog.

We have seen famous men throughout history who died shortly after they retired from greatness, as if their purpose in life had ended. I believe we choose our lives (in a spiritual sense) and I don't discount that when these mens' purposes had ended, that their souls chose to leave this life as well. Not ""chose"" in a literal sense, but,again, in a spiritual sense. Patton's purpose was to save the world from evil, which he did.

God Speed, General.",1495843200,2,796,4.559440559440559

996780,4,630522661X,"Considering this was done 15 years after the original Patton, Scott does a fine job.  What's missing is Jerry Goldsmith;s excellent score and The Patton March which I'm guessing the production couldn't afford so they tried to get as close to the melody as they could without getting sued. Since the original Patton ended without a mention of how this larger than life General died, it's almost required viewing.  You'll see two actors who went on to play characters from Aliens Gorman and Van Lewin;  The quality of the film is very poor, like it was copied off a VHS tape.",1475107200,2,573,4.653465346534653

996977,5,630522661X,I have read many books on Patton and his related death. Also movies such as Brass Target. Odlly enough played by GCS. But in Brass Target they deal with assassination of Patton. However I think it was just from his injuries and an eager President to get his best General back on American soil before he is ready to move. If you read Bill O'Riely's version of Killing Patton you will understand. I am glad GCS reprise his role in this movie. Maybe if we would have listened to Patton America would not have had to worry about the cold war. Just a thought.,1466553600,,554,4.336538461538462

Set the German prisoners to chopping wood for the winter for example. Covers parts of his early life and career as a series of flash-backs.  About half-way through the movie he has his accident, and you get to see what a talented actor George C. Scott really was, as he is confined to a hospital bed and can only express emotion using his face and his voice.  Many of the actors from PATTON reprise their roles.

Shortly after I finished it I realized that there was a sequel to it - 'The Last Days of Patton'.  Since the original was fresh in my head, I dropped this sequel into my watchlist and gave it a whirl.  The first thing that jumped out at me was the awful video quality.  Like....really really bad.  Given that this is much less of an action film than the original, that wasn't a huge problem, but I would be pretty upset if I were someone that had bought this on DVD and expected it to look acceptable.

I thought the storyline, which as far as I can tell is trying to accurately portray what happened, was decent and reasonably interesting.

And aside from the suggestion that Patton wanted to use captured Germans with the Americans to roll on over to Moscow and defeat the commies, and that he was physically moved too soon...while paralyzed and in a body cast....there was no further depth provided to suggest this as a major theory that Patton was actually assassinated. But maybe that was too controversial for a mid-80's poorly produced low-budget TV movie. It's sad that Scott accepted this project as it epitomizes the stereotypical 'Part 2' stinker.

My father loved the first movie (despite historical inaccuracy in a few spots). Dad didn't even mind the physical differences as Scott managed to capture the essence of the General which he felt was more important.

When this film first aired we sat and watched it together. It was the only time Dad's eyes ever watered up and he got up and left the room. I think that's quite the proof that Scott did it twice and did it right. I can think of no better praise in that this film moved a man who never showed emotion and still choked up decades later.

This film shows more of Patton's personal life, all the way from his early childhood to his untimely death in December 1945.  This film shows what a tormented man Patton was, most likely he would have been even more tormented had he lived much longer past the end of World War II.

I highly recommend this along with ""Ike"" Back then anyone complaining of what we now call PTSD, was considered a coward. You will see some battle scenes, but this is more about the man who in my opinion was pompous, & saw himself as a god-like warrior, invincible, at the cost of men who were seen as ""pawns"" in a game called ""War"" I understand why a tank was named after Bradley & not Patton.

ESCAPE FROM SOBIBOR is nothing less than remarkable: a gripping true story of a WWII mass escape from the concentration camp located in occupied Poland. To avoid land mines buried all around this site, 600 prisoners charged the front gate en masse and broke through. Machine gun fire killed half their number; the rest made it to freedom. This tragedy-turned-triumphant is a story never to be forgotten. Highest recommendation!

Scott slips back into the role sixteen years after his Oscar winning original portrayal with a more reflective take on this controversial four-star general, showing us not only his loving side, but even a cabaret-like song and dance parody that is actually quite good. And it is indeed a shame that so colorful a character had to end his life in traction, paralyzed by an auto accident, laid flat on his back, able only to talk . . . both to his physicians . ..  and his devoted wife, Beatrice, played by Eva Marie Saint.

In those hours, flashbacks take Patton to his childhood and early years at West Point, filling in some of the blanks in this career warrior's life.

The camera work and resolution of the recording is mediocre.  You can tell easily that this is a typical fuzzy network production from the pre-HD analog days where most viewers didn't have great televisions to sit in front of and absorb a high quality output.  Still, that is not a suitable excuse for stilted performances, which I would blame more on the directorial staff than on the performers.  Scott as Patton seems to be missing that electricity and panache that was exuded in abundance previously.  It's sad in a way.

Based on the utterly lousy picture and sound quality of the version I purchased (2003 DVD by Diamond), I must assume those who rated this mediocre TV movie any higher than a 1 have a different version from the one I bought. Multiple freezes and jumps in the picture (and of course sound) didn't help.

Some reviewers who weren't happy with their purchase decided to toss the DVDs or resignedly hold onto them instead of returning them, figuring it wasn't ""worth it"" to do so. Even if the thing cost only $3.95, Amazon pays the return shipping. Too bad everyone didn't return their crummy copies at Amazon's expense -- maybe Amazon would then get a clue that it isn't nice to offer sub-par DVDs to its consumers AND that maybe they should rewrite their programming so that reviews written PERTAIN TO THAT SPECIFIC VERSION ONLY.

Regardless of the release, I don't know why this film was even written and produced. It added nothing to our knowledge of Patton's life except to give him a mistress and show how he died. Too much of the script was a rehash of some of Patton's more pithy dialogue from the original film (but delivered with less panache and conviction), and the rest was embarrassingly cliched. The cast's stilted acting seem to indicate they knew they were conscious of the poor writing. Richard Dysart's Eisenhower was unintentionally funny in his forced delivery, like a banty rooster trying to discipline and humiliate a much larger, smarter, wiser fox.

While the first ""Patton"" film showed Patton the legend, it did not give us a chance to see Patton the man.  ""The Last Days of Patton"" remedies this by showing us Patton with his wife and giving us glimpses of his childhood and his relationship with his father.

It also completes the story of General Patton by starting right where the first film left off (the very end of World War II).  We once again get to see Patton's trademark thinking for himself - regardless of what his superiors back in Washington might be saying.  A perfect example: Patton believed in allowing experienced German government officials to be in charge of the day-to-day rebuilding of their country, even if it went against the official policy back in Washington of de-nazification of Germany.

We also see Patton's foresight as he predicts that the United States will be entering a new war with the Soviet Union, and he wants to be around to lead that war.  (If only he were, how different history might have been.)

No, he instead ""transferred"" him to a ""paper Army"" (Patton's words) where we see his depression start to mount.

The accident happens in the second hour, but the last 90 minutes drag. The last 90 minutes we see Patton slowly fading in mind and body as he lays in his hospital bed. Gone are his wit and acuteness.

Alas, one can guess the source of this DVD. A VHS tape.
I already owned the original Fox VHS tape, which I will continue to keep.
Yet, in quality, both are equivalent, neither worse, nor better.
The only minus lies in the fact that the DVD sports an evident superimposed logo on one corner of the image.
But this is not disturbing, since it is halfway transparent.
Yet they could have done without it.

So, back to the contents of this made-for-TV movie.
First of all, it comes in its original full content version, running slightly over three hours long.
The acting is fair for this kind of movie.
Names such as Murray Hamilton, Eva Marie Saint and Daniel Benzali (in one of his earliest appearances), give
you an idea of the caliber of actors involved.

As the title states, this is a more or less faithful account of the last days of Patton, involving him as the
Military Governor of occupied Bavaria and his relations and conflicts with General Eisenhower, which encompasses
the first half of the movie, to the tragic car accident that caused him to break his neck and surviving it for
a while (the second part of the movie).

We are also introduced into some flashbacks on Patton's earlier military career and his struggles to transform
a static Army, into a rolling and moving Force.
We get to see some of his romantic life and finally, is ultimate battle with Death itself.

He died a hero and consequent to what he believed in.

It is a very touching and moving picture of a very controversial historic figure, but despite all his human
frailties this big hulk of a man demonstrates that one can keep his dignity even to the end.
He was a fighter, beloved and perhaps even hated by those who knew him personally, but at least he was one man
who helped move things along in a time where many were too scared to act.

He was a leader, he was a war philosopher, a classic hero, like those he worshiped from Ancient History, and
therefore he may be considered sitting in the Pantheon of these peers of his.

This movie is a worthy complement to ""Patton"".

If only 20th Century-Fox would care to pick it up again, restore its original filmed material, digitalize it
and transfer it cleanly on DVD, they would have the appreciation of many who did appreciate and love the work
done on the transfer of ""Patton"".

Only time will tell, but I am sure, one day, someone may wake up and smell the coffee...

In the meantime, I can recommend this as an interim to that next version.
As said, it is not worse, nor better than its VHS counterpart, but being this a DVD, brings a more durable platform
to it.

George C. Scott

I'm recommending this movie because it brings closure to Patton's life.  If you enjoyed the first movie, Patton, you owe it to yourself to see this one even if it is flawed. Though I was disappointed with this film, I wanted more at the end. I felt the flashbacks did not go deep enough into his early life. It was almost as if this film came from scenes cut from the first movie, which won eight Academy Awards, and the flashbacks were filmed later and spliced in.  Because of this, The Last Days of Patton dragged at times. The producer and director should have put more time into the flashbacks. This might have remedied that problem. It's too bad that Patton died before he had a chance to retire and write his memoir. Since he was the type of man who spoke out about what he believed (which got him in trouble more than once even if he was right most of the time), his memoir would have been a great read. We can only imagine what the world would be like today if those in power had listened to him and gone on to defeat Russia.

1000183,2,630522661X,"I enjoyed Ladislas Farago's similarly titled book.  The book details Patton's activities during the last months of the war and continues to his untimely demise.  It also briefly explored the conspiracy theory's surrounding Patton's accident.  Unfortunately the movie concentrates on George S. Patton Jr.'s time as military governor, thinly veiled attempts to militarily rehabilitate German POWs incarcerated in Bavaria, and blatant animosity toward the Soviets.  Additionally, the film spends an awful lot of time on a paralyzed Patton, complete with flashbacks,  imobilized in his hospital bed.

It was great to see George C. Scott reprise his role as Patton.  The problem was that it was easier for a late 1960s Scott to be made up to appear as an older general in PATTON than it was to tackle the problem of an older and more stout Scott as Patton in the 1986 television movie.  Scott was just too plump for the role and those overly puffy white eyebrows were more appropriate for Santa Claus than Patton.

Remember too that this was a television movie filmed in Great Britain.  As such, the budget and associated production was not that of the original motion picture.  The US military vehicles are obviously from museums and private collector collections as the gray-green paint is absolutely perfect.  Likewise the GIs appear to be wearing less authentic looking period uniforms.  Additionally, where the original PATTON was filmed in a variety of Spanish locations including beaches, desert, and thick forest, LAST DAYS is mired in limited British locations.  In one scene the painted matte background of the Bavarian Alps is phony and distracting.

Although I cannot imagine anyone other than George C. Scott playing the part of Patton, he was not physically ready to take on the role.  Remember that the previous year Scott also portrayed a very chubby Benito Mussolini in MUSSOLINI: THE UNTOLD STORY.  Other former 'Pattons', such as George Kennedy, Kirk Douglas, and Darren McGavin never fit the role. This movie probably should never have been made in the first place, or limited as a narrarated docu-drama.

THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON  is as far removed from the original wide-screen movie as THE DIRTY DOZEN: (THE) NEXT MISSION is from the first THE DIRTY DOZEN film.

Worse for the film is that its sale and distribution, much like older movies that entered the public domain, have fallen to several different media companies.  As such you can find this movie with different covers, sometimes matched with other movies, and differing quality.

1000188,3,630522661X,"Interesting sequel to the movie Patton, but this is not a war film, it is a drama. Patton wrestles with how to handle post-war Bavaria:  Should he exclude Nazis from the new government, or should he include them to speed rebuilding? Should he allow SS members to continue to train in the prison camps? He clashes with Ike, and frets over not having men to lead in battle.

Life after the German surrender was nothing but worsening problems for the general, what with his chafing at running a bureaucracy, his stripping of authority by Ike, and finally on the day before he was to ship home, getting into a freak accident that broke his neck and paralyzed him.

I'm not sure some of the critics of this film appreciate how well Scott does with a tremendous challenge of depicting a physically dead man from the neck down, a man who once moved armies in one of the most important times in modern history, now bedridden and suspecting he faces death despite his doctors' forced cheer. It is touching to see his wife scramble to his side to comfort him and read him books, and disconcerting to know that her niece appears to be having an illicit affair with her own uncle-by-marriage.

This is a dark film, as it watches Patton's wife struggle with her husband's rather brave acceptance that he is transitioning towards death, and find bravery within herself as well.

Finally, as my husband observes, the best thing that happened to Patton was having George C. Scott play him on film -- talk about a posthumous career boost!",1165708800,3,1521,4.639405204460966

I'm glad the overall rating for this film is 4 stars. I say, Baloney, to the nitpickers. This is a very, very fine film that treats both the facts and the book upon which this film is based with accuracy and sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with the long final scene with Patton talking non-stop while lying in a hospital bed. In some ways, that is more about the true Patton than the image of him barking out orders. This death scene, in my view, is an achievement in biographical film making. True, some facts in the film were softened, such as Ike's chastisements of Patton, turning the final interview into an austere reprimand rather than the catalysimic destruction of a friendship that it was. And Patton was secretly under observation for signs of psychopathology (good thing our Civil War generals didn't live in the 20th Century!) And Patton was a lot more disgusted with the European Jews--and a lot chummier with the German Regular Army officers, than depicted in the film, but these facts are suggested in the film. And I feel that all of this is okay. Generally speaking, this genre is watched by history buffs, anyway, and we can fill in the blanks. We should all know by now that there's only so much you can do with a two-hour movie. I'll never forget the scene of Patton's wife in a powder blue dress and floppy hat test-driving a prototype tank in front of the mossback Cavalry Generals. By the way, Scott was 42 years old when he performed in the original PATTON. General Patton himself was between ages 59 to 60 during WW2. In this present film, Scott is the same age as Patton was. Good film. Well done.",1131926400,11,1636,4.583617747440273
1000270,3,630522661X,"George C. Scott reprised what may be his most famous role as General George S. Patton. Unfortunately, this seems to have been a mistake. The sequel has little of the quality of the original movie and even less interest. As biography, it was fair. As entertainment, it was a bore.

Scott still manages to maintain the image of the famous general. His bull headedness is present as is his conviction that he is the only savior of western civilization. So to does the impression that for Patton there is no calling more honorable than that of the soldier, even enemy soldiers. This comes out early in the movie while the general was assigned as the military governor of Bavaria. He dresses down some SS prisoners for thei slovenly ways and even they resond to his leadership style. There is a purpose to it, though, he wants them ready to fight under his command should the need to confront the Soviets arrise.

Patton's nature puts him at loggerheads with his superiors and the press. Eventually, he is to be releived for cause but fate intervenes in the form of an auto accident. The general breaks his neck and is paralyzed THe second half of the movie deals with his reaction, that of his family and friends and also that of politicians and the press.

There is very little excitment in this production. It relies heavily on dialog that could have been better. It also places some reliance on flashbacks which were inteded to demonstrate what kind of a man the general was. Some of these are effective; most are not. In general, it is a fairly boring movie.

There is some truth to the argument that the movie has some merit just as a biography. It does a fairly credible job of pointing out the conflicts in play right after the second world war. It aslo depicts the events concerned mostly as they happened. It is still boring.

The quality of the DVD also leaves much to be desired. Some of this is because this was a made for TV movie but much of the blame can be laid on the transfer itself. It has a tendency to skips and miss frames. Based on other reviews, I was not the only one to have this problem.

If your are a fan of historical biography, this movie may appeal to you. If you want to capture the excitement of the first one, though, you will be disappointed.",1114732800,8,2274,4.467469879518072

This was a made for TV movie on CBS many years ago and to be honest this DVD looked like it could have been recorded right off TV or from a second generation or more VHS tape. I knew I was in trouble when I saw Brentwood put this out. I had bought a few other TV show movies made into DVD's by them that were equally horrendous in quality. Sometimes content was even missing as if they went to the bathroom during a commercial and got back too late to start recording again. The poor picture and sound quality is only magnified on a widescreen TV and good sound system. The picture even had a tendency to shutter which makes me think all the more it was made from a VHS tape, and a poor one at that. Its too bad an otherwise outstanding movie was torpedoed by a bad transfer. DVD's often have special features and all you get here is a bad bio of George C. Scott set to music that must have come off a record player. Buyer beware.",1114732800,57,1077,4.037383177570093

This movie was made in 1986 and Scott looks older and less energetic than he did in 1970.  There is no battle action.  The drama consists mostly of political and inter-personal reactions to the Generals opinions and ideas concerning the defeated Germans and the Russians, both of which were noted in the movie ""Patton.""  Of historical interest, the accident that lead to his death and his hospitalization afterwards are depicted in detail.",1108166400,,558,4.8936170212765955
1000273,5,630522661X,"Anyone wanting to see ""Patton"" Part II in this film will be very disappointed; the films are different in pacing, outlook, and genre, and it is to George C. Scott's credit that he could portray both parts with equal skill, and perhaps this one was the hardest, to keep our interest (and I found it to be a fascinating film) while lying paralyzed in bed.

In the 1970 ""Patton"", the general was in his prime and at his best, with a sense of purpose...once the war was won, his reason for living came to an end, and he could not handle the political aspects of ""winning the peace"", with the constant pressure of having to present the ""politically correct"" stance towards the media; in many ways this is a timely film to watch, as the reconstruction phase of Germany was similar to present day Iraq, with chaos and some of the former regime clinging on to remnants of power, and a media bent on finding fault with the process.

After a tragic car accident, in which General Patton was paralyzed from the neck down, it was a matter of waiting out the final hours. The script by William Luce is poignant and often poetic, and the acting by the entire cast excellent. The two women in his life are played with sensitivity, his wife by Eva Marie Saint, and mistress by Kathryn Leigh Scott. Many scenes are recalled from his youth in flashback  (Ron Berglas plays the young Lt. Patton), some of it quite touching.

Others of note in the cast are Murray Hamilton as his good friend Gen. ""Hap"" Gay, Ed Lauter as Dr. Lt. Col. Paul Hill, and Richard Dysart as Gen. Eisenhower.

Filmed on location in England (the countryside shots are lovely), and directed for television by Delbert Mann, this is a serious film on a serious subject, and one many of us have been faced with, whether with an ailing parent, or the eventuality of our own passing. General Patton confronted his destiny with courage, and the love of a patient, strong woman, and said ""dying has always intrigued me...I'm not afraid, only curious"".
