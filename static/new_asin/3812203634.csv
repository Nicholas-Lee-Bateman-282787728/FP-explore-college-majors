8173180,5,3812203634,"From the first moment to the last this drama holds you riveted.  It's primarily about the complete conversion of a self-satisfied take-it-easy don't-get-involved type into a dedicated doctor.  He starts as a resident employed for his legal ability to prescribe medicines at an herbal alternative medicine clinic.  He is startled out of his complacent attitude by a sequence of events.  He observes a horrible traffic accident and the labors of a truly amazing trauma surgeon to save the lives of the victims.  Then finding himself the only doctor available when a couple brings their unconscious child to a hospital where he is filling in for a friend during a rainstorm.  The child dies under his care and he must face the parents with the news; on the taxi ride home the taxi driver asks him ""you are a doctor, aren't you,"" to which he replies, ""yes I'm a doctor.""  It is clear he doubts himself.  He quits his easy job and manages to put himself under the amazing traumatology surgeon for a one-of-a-kind apprenticeship.  The surgeon turns out to be a pariah at his hospital.  There are the usual office politics, governmental mishandling of important issues, and true heroism on the part of many of characters in this series.  Possibly the best, certainly one of the best Korean dramas of all time (and I've seen quite a few.)  I've re-watched this over 7 times and it never fails to move me.",1453507200,,1396,4.746887966804979
