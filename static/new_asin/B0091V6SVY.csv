5242828,5,B0091V6SVY,Perfect introduction of the plant based lifestyle to those professionals in your life.  Those doctors and nurses who by their years of training believe they know what's best to eat yet suffer the exact same health problems the general public undergoes.  The speakers brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to their positions.  The way that the message is simplified to appeal to the lay person and professional alike works very well without being graphic.  I feel very comfortable in giving this as a gift to those whose awareness I'd like to raise to these issues.  I highly recommend this product.  Thank you very much.,1444694400,,626,4.914285714285715

5242830,5,B0091V6SVY,After watching the videos 'Eating' and 'Fork Over Knives' I really appreciated hearing more from the authors and others on the topic of plant-based diets.  I found the video excellent and full of information relevant to the western cultures.  This should be given wider public exposure as too many of our populations are 'in the dark' regarding nutrition for our bodies.,1442880000,,370,5.049180327868853

5242832,5,B0091V6SVY,"My husband historically scoffed at my admonitions to eat a more healthy diet.  After watching this, he said he wished he had seen it 30 years ago. We are transitioning to vegan and finding delicious recipes on the Forks Over Knives site as well as on the internet. It's a good time to be making the change - so many great resources compared to when I was younger.",1438905600,2,363,4.338235294117647
5242833,5,B0091V6SVY,"I first watched this on NetFlix. I bought this DVD to show friends and family. I understand and totally agree with the conclusions made in this Extended Interviews and the original FOK production. The Extended Interviews gives more details and information. I didn't buy this for glitz, glamor and excitement. This is not a movie or an escape or a rush. Nor is it a perfect production, but it is well done and it is very very important. I have watched the series several times to pick up some of what I missed on previous viewings. The FOK series, for me, has been very informative and convincing as it is based on several real and comprehensive studies. The China study incorporated 650,000 persons to conduct the study over all of China. That is massive. Also there are observations by the players themselves that clearly illustrate the dramatic differences between the effects of a western/American diet, that emphasizes meat and dairy, and the effects of a whole plant food based diet, with regards to heart disease and cancer. The series also explains that nutrition is not a one on one, e.g. one nutrient for one effect, but a symphony of nutrients and effects. Best of all, plants provide all, all of the nutrients that one needs. With the elimination of animal protein and cholesterol from a persons diet, the occurrence of cancer and heart disease  may slow, stop and sometimes reverse.
The players in ""The Extended Interviews"" got it right.

This is about the consequences of what one eats and what studies show. Does one eat to live or live to eat? Let food be thy medicine.",1437264000,2,1584,4.7355072463768115

5242854,3,B0091V6SVY,"A little background:  I read Colin Campbell's ""The China Study"" cover-to-cover four months ago and became a vegan (again) for pragmatic reasons.  I had tried Mike Anderson's RAVE vegan diet in 2008 for 18 months but when I checked original research I found that Anderson had fudged or distorted some of his facts.  I also became vitamin D deficient with low energy and my physician advised that he had never seen a healthy long-term vegan so I switched back to a ""healthy"" mixed diet.  Campbell's book persuaded me to become vegan again and I take D and B12 supplements and eat more beans and lentils to avoid protein deficits.  After reading Lindsay Nixon's review saying that even she learned so much I was looking forward to doing the same.

Unfortunately, these are mostly pep talks for the choir with little useful information.  They feel like the seminar ""sell"" before you have to buy the course book with all the facts that really matter.  Campbell's talk is badly edited so that unless you have already read ""The China Study"" and know the topic he is discussing you will often be left in the dark.

Dr. Esselstyn tells us that even added olive oil (presumably cold-pressed) affects the epithelial cells of the blood vessels and limit their elasticity, but... he never says how large an effect this is, whether small amounts of oil make a relevant clinical difference, whether the effect is temporary or permanent, and whether this matters for purposes of prevention or primarily for his caseload of patients with hard-core heart disease.  One wants to learn from the DVD, not have little quick hints dropped to start a wholesale research project.

Psychologist Douglas Lisle (""The Pleasure Trap"") tells us that we evolved to seek pleasure, avoid pain and conserve energy but that commercial marketing has used these features to trick us into replacing a healthy natural apple with an incredibly pleasurable and energy-rich artificial chocolate apple that is not good for our health.  I say, ""That's nice, but I am already a non-dairy whole-food vegan.  Can you perhaps tell me something useful and new?""

So too, I fear, go the other talks in these ""extended interviews.""  Perhaps a DVD is just not the right medium to convey information of this sort, but the film maker also made the mistake of allowing the vegan gurus to chat on without direction or guidance that could have focused them on addressing clear questions and providing answers that good vegans want to know.",1401840000,9,2481,4.88782816229117

5242859,5,B0091V6SVY,"FORKS OVER KNIVES: THE EXTENDED INTERVIEWS is a companion to the critically-acclaimed DVD entitled FORKS OVER KNIVES - ""ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DOCUMENTARIES OF ALL TIME.""

There is some minor overlap between these two, equally compelling, DVDs.  Excerpts from the EXTENDED INTERVIEWS DVD are presented in the FORKS OVER KNIVES DVD.  However, this EXTENDED INTERVIEWS DVD presents extremely important, ""fill the gaps,"" and informative additional information.  A person should rightly view both DVDs.

Roger Ebert, the famous film critic and dean of U.S. film critics, said of FORKS OVER KNIVES - ""one of the most influential documentaries of all time:"" ""THIS IS A FILM THAT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE.""

Any person stands a substantially greater possibly of ""saving one's life"" if that person views FORKS OVER KNIVES: THE EXTENDED INTERVIEWS DVD, along with FORKS OVER KNIVES.  In fact, a person MUST, or SHOULD, view both of these DVDs, to fully profit from their combined, unified messages.

Now recently available: T. Colin Campbell's companion books entitled WHOLE: RETHINKING THE SCIENCE OF NUTRITION (May 7, 2013), and THE LOW-CARB FRAUD (February 25, 2014).  If you need assistance, to become a believer, utilize AMAZON.com's ""Look Inside"" feature, and review the professional endorsements of WHOLE: RETHINKING THE SCIENCE OF NUTRITION, and be sure to note the professional stature of the professionals providing these endorsements, as well as the language of the endorsements.  These two books are available here on AMAZON.com.

T. Colin Campbell is one of the two principal stars, and apparent catalyst, in FORKS OVER KNIVES: THE EXTENDED INTERVIEWS.

Ironically, regarding low-carb diets, people don't seem to know that when a person experiences carbohydrate deficiency, a person's liver will convert protein in the body to carbohydrate, for fuel and energy.",1396742400,3,1864,5.434027777777778

5242865,4,B0091V6SVY,"I chose this rating because I learned so much about the food industry.  Only independent film makers who don't have to answer to big corporations can do serious investigative reporting like this. As far as the topic, I am 80% in agreement with the doctors views, however, the total vegan life style seems extreme to me unless one is trying to save his or her life due to illness.  I'm not sure I'm ready to give up on a  nice sliver of cheese, or an eggplant topped with a little feta. Nor do I think using an egg once in a while to cook with is so terrible.  The chickens don't suffer to provide eggs. After watching this I will most likely pursue a vegetarian lifestyle.  Not sure about a vegan life style, though.
The interviews really enforced the films point.  Although, the production seemed a bit boring, the information is worth sitting through a dry subject.",1388793600,,867,4.490445859872612
5242866,5,B0091V6SVY,"Many years ago George Ohsawa watched many in his family die because they had switched to Western medicine which only treats the symptoms.  He dug back in his own country's history and found a diet and philosophy that saved his life.  It's called Macrobiotics.  Dirk Benedict wrote in his first book, Confessions of a Kamikaze Cowboy, about his prostate cancer and how he was healed through this diet.  That happened in the early seventies.  Doctors and science are finally catching up.

Many people are healthy and alive today because of this diet.  It is my diet so I can vouch for it. Your energy will go through the roof. You'll stand taller and straighter.  But you have to do it to believe it.  And you have to seriously, and actively,  care about your health.

There is one thing I question - the part about poor people having poor choices and not having available to them what they need.  Rice is cheap.  Veggies from the Farmer's Market are relatively heap.  Millet and buckwheat, also.  This diet is cheaper than eating fast food or processed food.  It's about the cheapest - and healthiest - way you can eat.  Anyone can do it but the info that is out there is so false it misleads everyone no matter what their financial situation is.

This movie should be shown in schools beginning with the elementary level.  In colleges.  In businesses and factories.  On planes.  I'm going to start with one DVD for my family and have them pass it around.",1388534400,,1454,4.59765625

It is a ""must watch"" for everyone interested in maintaining health and fighting off the deleterious impact on ourselves and our families of the SAD/standard American diet.  Don't miss it--and do read the companion source materials, ""The China Study"" by Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell and ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"" by Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn of The Cleveland Clinic.  If Dr. Esselstyn can make President Clinton change his diet, then you know that he is on to something important.  This film identifies and explains findings of the pioneers of the whole-food, plant-based movement.  I hope that the producers will create a sequel to show how this grassroots movement is picking up strength and spreading.",1377907200,,799,5.115384615384615

5242877,5,B0091V6SVY,"I highly recommend this dvd.  Initially,you may not like what you hear, but put these simple principles into action and you will be amazed at the resulting vitality and elimination of many chronic diseases, including diabetes.  Especially convincing, for me,
were the actual patients...before & after the dietary changes.....their bloodwork, their stamina and even their appearance. It was really a WOW, for me.  Also, very impressive was the data from WWII, in Norway, when during the Nazi occupation, the dairy  & meat were  removed from the Norwegian diet, and cancer and osteoporosis virtually disappeared.  But within just a
few years of the reentry of these 'foods', the incidence of these diseases  went off the charts!  Today, Norway has one of the highest rates for osteoporosis and the resulting fractures of the hip & etc, and also has the highest intake of dairy in the world!",1372550400,,888,5.075862068965518

5242879,5,B0091V6SVY,I couldn't get enough information about the American diet.  It really almost sounds illegal how the government has bamboozled the public.  Talk about propaganda-a word I first learned in grade school regarding how Hitler gained power.,1371168000,,234,5.472222222222222
5242880,5,B0091V6SVY,Great to get all the interviews from these men who have done so much research in nutrition.  Dr. McDougall was new to us and I have since been to his website and gotten LOTS of great recipes.,1369872000,,191,4.162162162162162
5242881,5,B0091V6SVY,This is a great addition to the original film. Portions of the interviews were a repeat but necessary to tie everything together. Wish it could have all been in one movie. Learned a lot more toward keeping our family healthy.,1368748800,,225,4.65
5242882,5,B0091V6SVY,"The presentations on this DVD have completely changed my life permanently for the better. I have known about the benefits of the vegetarian diet for some time but I really didn't know how valuable until I saw my first DVD on Forks Over Knives. Then I watched this DVD and stopped eating dairy and meat and every day I get to feeling just a little bit better and believe me at my 80 years this is extremely important. The producers of the work have done a very valuable thing for mankind. Please, get this DVD and watch it.",1367193600,14,522,4.336734693877551

5242892,5,B0091V6SVY,"Though I have watched FOK 4 times, I found this DVD invaluable in clarifying some of the main points.  Some of the facts, by allowing more in depth time coverage, I felt were really brought home. And there was some new information as well.  Though I understand the thought that some of this may have been added to the first DVD FOK, I feel differently.  For one, I am not sure what would have been able to be cut.  I think all the information and the personal stories add up to an extremely well done and complete picture.  Second, and for me very important, is that there are many people in my life who have not implemented the ideas from the first installment, though they found the information compelling.  I am very happy to have another means of conveying the information in a way that will reconfirm and remind them of the importance of staying with the ideas presented in the first DVD.

It's presented by well respected health and medical professionals, not some fly by night wacko.  I have done more research and am chaning the way I eat although it's not something I find terribly easy to do.  I think that making small changes along the way is easier for me as I research what kinds of recipes are appealing to me and my family. I loved the statemnt someone made that said your mouth will learn to love the foods you eat. Doctors recieve only a very tiny amount of education  about nutrition in medical school and most offer liitle nutritional information to their patients so this is such a valuable resourse.",1361923200,3,774,4.507142857142857
5242895,5,B0091V6SVY,"Good addition to the original movie ""Forks over knives"".

I read most of the books from the doctors in this DVD, however, I miss 2 more that are not represented and highly recommendable:

Dr. Michael Greger M.D. (nutrition facts org),
who summarizes thousands of scientific studies every year in the field of clinical nutrition
Dr. Fuhrmann - check out his books on Amazon here

Together they give a very consistent picture (with the small exception on some nuts...) and good recommendation to improve your health, live longer and cut your cancer risk by roughly 50%.",1361059200,4,567,4.947368421052632

But I was very disappointed - after the first movie, that was really great, this one is merely a compilation of interviews that if you already went a bit deeper into this have seen on other pages, nothing new. I guess I expected a bit more of a sequel to FOK, this could very well be ""bonus-material"" on the first DVD but not a DVD on its own. Guys, you are great and I really enjoy every word I see/hear/read from you, but it would just have been nice to see something new.",1357430400,13,576,4.06140350877193

5242904,5,B0091V6SVY,"I've been plant-based for several years and know nearly all the doctors in this film on a personal level -- either we've worked together, spoken at the same conference, etc. I've seen all of their lectures many times over.

The point isn't that I'm a biased groupie -- the point is that *I* learned a wealth of information from this DVD. You would think given my ""experience"" I had nothing left to learn -- but I did. This DVD answered every question I ever had or has been asked of me. What I also like is that the interview's are short. Nice bite-sized pieces of information. That keeps it from being overwhelming. I could give this DVD to my family, knowing they could watch it in pieces rather than overloading them with so much new information they can't swallow all of it.

I always recommend FOK and know I will recommend this DVD as well for anyone new to a plant-based diet (or seasoned folks like myself) or anyone who simply wants an answer to ""what happened?"" and ""how can I get healthy again?""",1356048000,84,1006,4.461956521739131
