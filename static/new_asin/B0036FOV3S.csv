4077716,5,B0036FOV3S,"""Brilliant"" doesn't even remotely come close to describing Valentina Igoshina's astounding, impeccable performances of some of Chopin's most beloved compositions.  She doesn't simply play them - she lives them.  This liquid music pours out of the piano, sometimes in gentle streams, sometimes in graceful fountains, sometimes in explosive erupting geysers, splashing against the sounding board and lid of the gleaming Steinway grand piano in cascading avalanches of tumbling waves of sound.

Her fingers float over the keys like smoke, caressing them like the gentlest touch of a butterfly's wing, then fly across the keyboard with the agility and speed of a hummingbird.  Her precision, however, is never compromised by expression.  Every note is carefully crafted and controlled, regardless whether it is played as the quietest pianissimo or crashing fortissimo; and regardless whether it is played as the slowest largo or franticly racing presto, or any combination of these primary musical forces.  Her playing is as clear and dazzling as a Swarovski's crystal in sunlight.  One might expect performances of this magnitude from a seasoned virtuoso, decades older than Valentina.

Only a musical avatar can play some of the most difficult music ever composed and make it look easy and joyous to play, but Valentina does this effortlessly.

One of the greatest composers who ever lived, Chopin's music is like a curve of gold, and Valentina's performances polish it to make it glitter like starlight dancing on water.

I only wish that there had been more cameras used from different angles, capturing every graceful move and tiniest nuance.  A split screen simultaneously showing her facial expressions while also playing the keyboard would have been a phenomenal documentation of this most rare artistic mastery.  It is a loss to have to choose between seeing her emotive face or her sculptured hands and fingers sweeping across this beautiful instrument.

It is gratifying to discover that, in a world so engulfed in superficial hype, political spin and tabloid shallowness, that substance, sensitivity, intelligence and elegance not only still exist but are alive and well in the musical heart of Valentina Igoshina, and for this we can all be deeply grateful.",1336867200,,2266,5.331460674157303
4077717,5,B0036FOV3S,"Quite simply the greatest pianist in the world today.  Her coloration of tone is consistently spot on.  Add to her melding with the music, and you have an artist who makes the passion and technique of Chopin come to life as the master himself would have played it.  High emotion?  Yes!  Great virtuosity?  Yes!  Superb!",1321574400,3,319,4.6909090909090905
4077718,1,B0036FOV3S,"I found this artist had a take on Chopin's music that is off the beaten path, her playing is in my opinion dreary and lacks feeling for the music.. The video was shot with very high quality equipment using filters to create a halo around her and and limit the color content of the scene. The Video is simply monochrome in appearance, not bad really but not exciting either... jp",1303689600,4,378,4.414285714285715
4077719,5,B0036FOV3S,"This is more documentary than movie but it is very entertaining. It redefines Chopin's character and, for me, adds another dimension to his music. The previously conceived portrait of Chopin was of an introvert sickly genius pouring out his poetic music to a background of unrequited love. Well it transpires that this is far from the truth. He was a hansom youth with many friends and a great passion for the ladies. This movie makes you realize that his music didn't simply come from some gifted sub-conscience part of his brain but was a product of genius inspired by real life experiences. It replaces 'Chopin the God' with 'Chopin the Man'. And Valentina Igoshina's playing is mesmerizing. If you buy this movie you ought to buy the dvd of Valentina Igoshina playing Chopin too. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",1296691200,6,809,4.827338129496403
4077720,5,B0036FOV3S,"I would have at least 20 DVDs of Chopin piano works. I would rate this one among the best, if not THE best. The occasional short interludes where she gives an intimate chat, are delightful and add to the overall performance.
Her playing is absolutely first class; sensitive yet bold where needed, beautiful tone and she shows an emotion which is in harmony with the music. After buying one disc, I bought five more to give to friends.
I hope there will be more new discs of her to follow.",1287878400,12,488,4.433333333333334
4077721,5,B0036FOV3S,Oh God! No words of mine can adequately  express how  gorgeously she plays. Never in my life have I ever heard better Chopin playing.,1280620800,14,133,4.5
4077722,5,B0036FOV3S,"Quite simply, this is one of the very best Classical piano videos available.

Purely from a musical aspect Valentina Igoshina is a magnificent artist, with several of these performances easily ranking among the greatest recordings of Chopin's music. In one of the included short interviews she mentions that the composer is like a family member to her - as close in her affections as her parents - and after hearing the playing on this disc her deep emotional bond with Chopin's world is evident.  Although too brief, Igoshina's little narratives are gems since they place these interpretations in perspective.  Watching her speak one immediately senses an absolutely genuine, beautiful, humble personality who wants nothing more than to share her love of the music.  There is none of the artificial grandstanding and posturing commonly encountered in interviews with many musicians, and this sincere emotional directness clearly projects through the pianist's recordings.

As a graduate of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow, a world-class technique is a given.  Although she has won top prizes in several competitions, she's unfortunately not well-known in this country.  I only became aware of her name through various piano forum discussions.  She is an example of the phenomenon of an extremely gifted musician who should be much more widely visible, but who somehow has not received the acclaim bestowed upon the small group of superstars who garner much of the publicity - even though Igoshina is a greater musician than many of those household names.

As a telling example of Igoshina's complete immersion and devotion to the music, she describes how she struggled for nearly a decade to play what most would consider a beginner's ""easy"" piece that every student has played at the start of their piano lessons:  the brief Prelude in A major, Op. 28 No. 7.  The struggle, of course, is not playing the notes - it's the search for the elusive musical meaning.  In the majority of recordings of the Preludes cycle, this work is treated as an inconsequential trifle, something to pass through quickly in order to get as fast as possible to the more grand, flashier items. However, in Igoshina's world nothing is unworthy of her full attention and care, even the briefest and simplest of pieces.

Another facet that impresses is her ever-present desire to make music breathe.  A significant dividing line between a merely competent performer versus one who really listens is the manner in which pauses - silences - are used.  Igoshina is masterful in this crucial aspect.  Moreover, her tone throughout is full and rich, with a very finely gauged sense of balance and dynamics that make the melodies sing naturally. Perhaps the best example of her approach is the Nocturne in C minor, Op. 48 No. 1, which can be viewed on YouTube. This is one of greatest tests in the piano literature for an interpreter, since the work runs through a wide gamut of emotions from the hushed, haunted beginning to the devastatingly anguished ending. Igoshina clearly takes on the role of a storyteller, with vocally-inflected nuances in her phrasing, and has recorded what is perhaps the best overall performance of this masterpiece that I have ever encountered.  She does not need to rely on histrionics or distortions to produce such a powerful impression.  Although in the background there is always an underlying classical sense of proportion, the emotionally wrenching core is conveyed undiluted - directly and intensely to the heart.

Don't be misled by the hazy backlighting, luxurious backgrounds, and delicate appearance of the pianist - when power and passion are called for Igoshina comes through.  The warhorse octave charge in the middle of the Polonaise in A flat, Op. 53 is one such unexpected moment: not uncommonly pianists begin forte and maintain the same volume throughout this passage, creating a sense of monotony.  Igoshina instead inexorably builds up the dynamics of each charge to a great climax that is much more effective.

The production values are very high, with top-notch lighting and sound recording.  The Steinway has a full tone with a rich bass that is well-captured.  The director's camera angles are well thought out, with edits that are natural and unobtrusive.  For pianists, there are many moments where the focus is upon Igoshina's hands, so her fluent flowing technique can be observed clearly.

Of note, several items from this DVD are available on YouTube, and have garnered quite a bit of well-deserved attention.  For example the Fantaisie Impromptu - another superb recording - has over 2 million views.  But fortunately the disc includes an equally beautiful and dramatic performance of a major work, the First Scherzo, that is not obtainable online. Even more importantly, the DVD is of a significantly higher quality than the Internet postings and is thus well worth purchasing.  The piano in particular sounds much richer - in a side-by-side comparison one can readily hear and see a ""granular"" and ""thinner"" atmosphere in both the audio and video on YouTube that is not evident on the DVD. The interpretations are of the very high calibre that one would want to collect for a personal library to enjoy again and again; since copyrighted material on YouTube is often eventually deleted, this disc removes that not insignificant uncertainty.

This year's 200th Anniversary of Chopin's birth has brought forth many enjoyable new recordings and historic re-releases, but if I had to rank just one as the highlight it would be this well-programmed, gorgeously performed recital. I would strongly urge anyone who loves the rich legacy of the piano to explore this extraordinary pianist's gift.",1273276800,55,5729,5.122448979591836

8389960,5,B0036FOV3S,"Valentina Igoshina demonstrates impeccable mastery of the piano as she performs several of her favorite pieces by Romantic era master Frederic Chopin.  She performs wearing a modified, and slightly revealing period costume, and coyly interacts with the camera while playing, which I suspect will result in a much wider than typical music fan demographic finding their way to an interest in the work of Chopin.",1415577600,,409,5.292307692307692

I love her delicate performances and Tony Palmer's elegant filming, which succeed as a reminder of other, passionate times. Her brief interviews are endearing and show a more human, whimsical side of the pianist, in contrast with the touching, raw energy displayed while executing the pieces.

Don't be taken in by a pretty face! I truly believe that the previous reviewers were taken in by the beauty of this performer. If you know anything about classical piano, you know that most of the most important pieces have been abbreviated! The Scherzo; Sonata; and Polonaise have been cut! If I want to listen to  abbreviated works, which I don't, I'll tune to SIRIUSXM's Pops Classic station. I don't even put this staion into my radio favorites! Sure, she has a good technique; but I need more than that! I have listened to classical music for over 50 years and I am not going to be hoodwinked into beliveing that this is the best
Chopin playing ever!!!???? Rubinstein, one of the greatest interperters of
Chopin's music, said it succinctly:''You have to be able to cummunacate with the audiance. Other wise you may as well be soda jerks!' I am so dissapointed with this disc that I am thinking about sending this back to Amazon! I have been duped! Don't believe the hype! THIS DISC IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!! Not if you're a seasoned listener. THIS DVD IS ONLY FOR THE NOVICE!!!!!!!!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on a pretty face!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I I WON'T WATCH THIS DISC AGAIN! WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1347753600,4,1407,4.742857142857143
