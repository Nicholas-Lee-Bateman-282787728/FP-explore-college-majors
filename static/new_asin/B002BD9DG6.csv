8360989,2,B002BD9DG6,"Dreary depiction about a specific moment in time among the 'casuals' who attend football matches as a 'firm'. There's really not much to like about the characters, and we honestly see very little of their lives aside from fighting, fornicating and drinking. The depiction of the primary character's family relationship is shallow, and frankly, his relationship with his sister is kind of creepy.
Honestly, if you take away the great songs by Ultravox and Joy Division, this film would be one long, dark, down note.",1358035200,,514,5.0588235294117645
8360990,1,B002BD9DG6,"I loved this film because my husband grew up in the area in which it was filmed. Birkenhead and surrounding area lent a great deal of authenticity to the story and made this film fun to watch. If you want a dose of true life football hooligans, this is a good one.",1304121600,,264,4.096153846153846
8360991,2,B002BD9DG6,"This movie is set in the late 70's around a mob of proto-casuals who follow Tranmere, it's about a young guy who wants to join the pack, but doesn't have the connections except for a closeted junkie who he knows from the local music scene. The movie is watchable but doesn't pack a punch and is divorced from reality, the pack looked more like mods with their green jerkins than a casual firm. The sound track seems to be a big deal, I don't know why because not many casuals would appreciate joy division B-sides, if you want a movie about the terraces watch the firm or green street. If you want a film about benders and bland music then you might appreciate this bleak look at Britain in the late 70's.",1262217600,,705,4.348484848484849
