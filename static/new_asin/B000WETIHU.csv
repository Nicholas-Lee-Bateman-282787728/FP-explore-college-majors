8223056,3,B000WETIHU,"This video teaches you specifically how to do the styles on the cover only.  The styles were cute, but not for me. I thought this dvd was going to cover the basics of hair cutting techniques.",1385942400,,191,4.305555555555555
8223057,5,B000WETIHU,Very detailed. Was exactly what I was expecting in a step by step DVD. I have learnt quite a few techniques and I was like 'aaaah so that's how you do it!'. I am 24 and have been doing hair since the age of 13 so I ve had the time to learn many tricks for weaving and this DVD added a few more up my sleeve. Definetely recommend it if you're serious about hairdressing. Remember that you'll have to watch it a few times in order to grasp or remember the tricks.,1300406400,,461,3.967741935483871
8223058,5,B000WETIHU,"From a stylist's standpoint, a good portion of it was self explanatory, however she shares some interesting techniques that are invaluable. The mohawk style is absolultely gorgeous, in fact I did it on myself, and I rocked it! Only I used dark and light pink for the middle.for some people who don't know how to improvise, and work within a time frame, or even how to come close to these looks, the tips were worth the $29.99.. Thank you!",1294272000,3,438,4.556962025316456
8223059,2,B000WETIHU,"The styles in the video was all right, but what client would come back to the salon and get the same hair style done over. I wish she show different styles and not the same one done over & over.",1236816000,3,194,3.875
8223060,4,B000WETIHU,"It is good for begginers and professionals alike. I just needed a step by step do at home video and found it was fairly good and right now I am all revved up to buy a 12"" milky way yaki weave and sew in some tracks for real yall it was that good.
