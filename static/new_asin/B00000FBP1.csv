7907629,5,B00000FBP1,"I agree completely with the reviewer A Customer, the training film that the pilots were required to watch is fabulous!  I found it to be fascinating and I felt like I could fly the plane after watching it twice!  I went back then and watched the take off and landing sections of the video.  Steve Hinton does an adequate job explaining things; he is a pilot first, not a showman or emcee!  I recommend these books to go along with any serious study of the Avenger:  from Squadron Signal Publications:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TBM-TBF-Avenger-in-Action-Aircraft-No-82/dp/0897471970/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TBM/TBF Avenger in Action - Aircraft No. 82</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TBF-TBM-Avenger-In-Action-50225/dp/0897476573/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TBF/TBM Avenger In Action (50225)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TBF-TBM-Avenger-Walk-Around-No-25/dp/0897474244/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TBF/TBM Avenger - Walk Around No. 25</a>.

7907630,4,B00000FBP1,"I had bought an original Roaring Glory VHS several years ago about the P-40 with Jeff Ethell doing a great job on that particular program. So, when I saw these newer Roaring Glory DVD's, I had to try them out.  I began with the Grumman Avenger because this was not a fighter plane like all the others.  The DVD has great in-flight footage and the extras are nice to have such as the actual WWII training film (excellent!).  My only critique is that it's not long enough!  The flight sequence with Unlimited racer Steve Hinton is only around 24 minutes. His delivery is matter of fact and I enjoyed Jeff Ethell much more, but at least these programs are getting made! It's neat to see this torpedo bomber put through it's paces, but the whole flight check is just not long enough for my tastes.  Overall, though, to see this plane flying is more than enough reason to get these DVD's.  They remind us of what truly was the American spirit to come up with these beautiful but deadly warplanes.  And at barely $6 a DVD, you can afford to get all of the titles in this series...",1129507200,7,1074,4.393939393939394
