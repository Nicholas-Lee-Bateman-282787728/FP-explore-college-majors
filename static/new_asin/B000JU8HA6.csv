8153135,3,B000JU8HA6,"I've always said you get a lucky dip with Alpha Video and in this case it's a double lucky dip. Two movies that only have the word Harlem in common.
Harlem Rides the Range (1939) - This is the main billing on the DVD even though it's only a 56 minute film. Basically it's unwatchable. Blurry video and bad audio.  Seek an alternate release of this public domain film.
Murder in Harlem (1935) - This 'bonus' movie is by far the better transfer even though it is the older movie.  Not a great transfer but watchable and audio is fine given the age and lack of restoration.
Overall 3 stars.",1496793600,,587,4.327272727272727
8153136,3,B000JU8HA6,"Harlem Rides the Range, 1939 film

This is a rare western movie that features an all African-American cast with a story similar to other movies from that era. You fool, youve killed him! Two cowboys happen to ride by, they are looking for a job. The Lord helps those who help themselves. Does Dusty need glasses? Slim the cook shoots at cans with a gun that fits his hand. Shooting the bull? Bob Blake is from Amarillo-way. Joe Connors is the foreman. Bob sings a song about a lone cowboy being called home. There is action later at night. This will probably cost me my job. Mr. Watson makes a change. Slim and Dusty go to see Mr. Dennison. There is some comedy. Watson and Blake arrive there with the sheriff. Cactus plans to hunt skunks. Tex was shot in the back. There is another song.

Blake will ride into town for the mail. He is warned against his curiosity. Can an innocent man be framed by a dropped glove? Can Bradley find the hidden mine? Dennisons daughter will arrive with money. Will Bradley plan a trick? Can Blake escape jail to help Miss Dennison? A letter reveals Bradleys plans to the sheriff. There is a chase, then a shootout. Will the sheriffs men arrive in time to save Blake and Miss Dennison? Yes. Cactus gets that skunk. There is a happy ending for all of the good guys. [Continuity?]

This is a typical Western where a small ranchers property is saved by a heroic cowboy. This movie is a low-budget production, but worth watching once. Note the mention of a valuable radium ore mine. There must have been a wide interest in radium before WW II.",1487376000,,1571,4.466898954703833

I enjoyed a good quality DVD, which also included F.E. Miller!  I would recommend parents showing this movie to there kids (versatility purpose).",1186790400,3,369,5.362068965517241
