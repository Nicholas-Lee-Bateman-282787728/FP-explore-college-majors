1018895,4,6305396841,"If you collect memorabilia from the 1964 Ny World's Fair, you will want to make this part of your collection. Unfortunately, it is only fragments of the Fair. It will leave you wishing someone would have had the insight to film a full documentary showcasing every exhibit.",1364601600,3,272,4.808510638297872
1018896,3,6305396841,"As a documentary recording of the Fair I found it useful and would be to anyone researching expo's, world's fairs or expositions of one sort or another.

It did give me a better appreciation of just how difficult it can be to mount these sorts of expressions particularly when you are snubbing your nose at the ""official"" international organising body of such events.  Us humans can and do tend to get caught up in habit which can equate with boring. Hey occasional we need to take a different path to break away from the beaten track. Otherwise it all just becomes predictable rehash. Can understand why they chose a steam roller like Robert Moses to bulldoze it through.

As an entertainment the DVD in itself was pretty so so!",1345593600,,729,4.635658914728682
1018897,5,6305396841,Wonderful!  Item was exactly as advertised & arrived promptly.  Would definitely order from this seller again.  Took a while to write a proper review because it was a birthday present and I was unable to actually watch the video for a few weeks.,1321401600,,245,4.651162790697675
1018898,5,6305396841,"I find this documentary charming and delightful. This VHS would be an incredibly great nostalgic gift to anyone who attended the Fair.  The American post-world war II dream was on display with avengence at the New York World's Fair. Great visuals of the wonderful Art and Technology which were displayed side by side. Very good script, narrated by Judd Hirsch of TAXI fame. Fun interviews with grownups who attended the Fair as children and really loved it. Great home-movie, and commercial visuals and audio about almost every aspect of the Fair. Lots of interesting info and trivia. All in all a very enjoyable production. 51 million people attended the great New York World's Fair between 1964 and 65.",1272240000,6,704,4.966101694915254
1018899,5,6305396841,"When I saw this, I had to have it, for I was there, at the 1964 World's Fair!  I was 6 years old, and my parents took my 8 yr. old sister and I on a roadtrip from Indiana to New York City (we went to the Empire, saw the Rockettes, Times Square, etc., I was 6 mind you), to the World's Fair, it was awesome and SO far ahead of it's time, was I lucky.  In my mid 30's I moved to Manhattan and still live here for 17 years, and go out to the US Open tennis which is right at the site where the Fair was, got those memories. Thanks, parents!  The DVD  is great, very well done, entertaining, informative, tells all about the history of the Fair, the building of it and takes you all over it, the great original footage, well worth the purchase to own. Something like this was once in a lifetime, if you didn't make it there, buy this and take the trip, you'll enjoy it too!",1264982400,6,869,3.9485714285714284
1018900,2,6305396841,Really kind of of boring.  Much more about the building as opposed to the attractions I remember so fondly.,1250726400,,107,4.631578947368421
1018901,5,6305396841,"Unlike others who gave this DVD a bad review I thought it was very well done, quite informative and entertaining. As a boy I visited the fair a few times and loved it . This DVD helped bring back all of the wonder I felt back then.

If someone tells you that they watched this DVD and didn't see the World's Fair and only heard people talking about it that could mean only one thing: they had their eyes shut. There are tons of scenes of the Fair here and I enjoyed every second of them. Yes, there is some home movie footage included but there is just as much, if not more, pro-shot footage as well. The visuals do not ""meander"" or ""pad out"", they provide visual context to Judd Hirsch's narration. There are many scenes of the inside of the pavilions, especially the Futurama, one of the best attractions of the Fair. If you want to see ""rides"" (I presume that means pavilions that carried you through them in some way) they're here: the Swiss Sky Ride, the U.S. Royal Ferris wheel, the AMF monorail, the Ford Pavilion, the Pepsi ""It's A Small World"" boat ride, the Futurama, the GE pavilion -and all are shown in the documentary. I suppose for some people the only acceptable scenario would be to show the contents of every pavilion from start to finish, even if it took nine hours. Remember, this was a documentary made for Public TV, they only had 52 minutes to tell the whole story of the Fair. Besides that, as far as I've been able find, and I've searched high and low for years, there is only one existing film that shows a ""ride"" from start to finish and that's a film that GM made of the Futurama and a lot of that film is shown in this documentary. Watch your own home movies because they're probably better made? No way.

Yes, there are interviews with frequent fairgoers, but they do not dominate the story, they add insight about what the Fair was really like. Apparently references to local landmarks made one reviewer think of this documentary as a ""neighborhood home movie"", which is absurd - these were personal recollections by people who happened to live near the fair and visited it often - who better than to give a first hand account of what it was like to be there and what the site was like after the fair was gone? No, you didn't have to grow up in Queens to enjoy this movie.

As for the music, it doesn't ""meander"" and it isn't ""purposeless"" either. Many of the films used in this presentation (I have seen most of them in their original forms) were silent or had their own narration attached to them, so the producers had to add their own background music under Mr. Hirsch and it was tastefully and skillfully done. That's what is done in documentaries: music is added to evoke atmosphere. It's not ""purposeless"". Show me one good documentary that doesn't use it. (You can't.) My only complaint with the music is the theme song over the opening titles and losing credits: it was supposed to sound like early 60's pop but it sounds too much like, and is just as annoying as, Dire Straits' ""Walk of Life"".

The only other criticism I have is the claim that the Belgian Waffle left the single most lasting impression on fairgoers. That is just plain ridiculous. What impressed me most was the futuristic architecture, the immense size of it all, and the way the fair looked after dark, all of which are wonderfully depicted in this DVD. Until this DVD mentioned the waffles I had completely forgotten about them.

I really don't know what the bad reviewers expected from this DVD; no one at the 1964 World's Fair Corporation had the foresight to make their own  documentary at the time (aside from one short promotional film) so the producers who made this one had to use what home movies and corporate films that were available, 36+ years after the fact. I for one think they did a great job and I think they deserve a lot of credit.

This one is well worth checking out.",1188432000,49,3899,4.467696629213483
1018902,1,6305396841,"The positive review here should be a clue: if you grew up in Queens in the 1960's, you may enjoy this movie. Otherwise don't bother. This film turns the World's Fair into a neighborhood home movie, padding even its short length with a lot of purposeless, meandering footage and even more purposeless, meandering music. Watch your own home movies: they're probably better  made.",1180828800,6,377,4.984126984126984
1018903,5,6305396841,Great memories. Many home movies combined into one DVD. I went to the World's Fair 18 times in 1964 and saw myself walking along in this DVD!,1178928000,4,141,4.2592592592592595
1018904,1,6305396841,"I was expecting to see the 1964 World's Fair, instead I heard only people talking about the World's Fair.  You only see the outside of the Buildings. If you like to hear people TALK about the World's fair and see home movies of people talking about the World's fair then by all means buy it but if you are expecting to see the rides , etc. don't waste your money.  We were very disappointed.",1167264000,30,391,4.27027027027027

1019025,5,6305396841,Attended the 1964-65 worlds fair. This brought back so many memories. I can remember the first time I saw the unisphere as if it was yesterday. The thing most remembered are the Belgian waffles. Wish I could relive those days. You really don't appreciate things as much when you're 18 years old.,1441670400,,295,4.6923076923076925

1019028,3,6305396841,"The DVD was fairly good but, I wanted to see more of the Ford pavilion and the ride in the new cars.  Disney was only mentioned once which they had a lot more to due with the  Fair than what was shown.  There was to much film of people and the lines to see the exhibits witch was dated for the time as far a fashion but took  to much of the time of the DVD.  All in all it was a good view of the Fair as a visitor would want.",1388620800,3,425,3.5760869565217392

I was hoping for some footage of the inside of the pavilions and various presentations ( Great moments with Mr. Lincoln, Its a small world, America sings). There was non of that, just some interviews with people who had attended and footage of the main thourofair and buildings. For me it was almost worthless.",1487808000,,346,4.783333333333333

7888737,5,6305396841,"I went to the NY Worlds Fair when I was nine years old and I've never forgotten it. It was truly an amazing event and the two or three days I spent there with my family made a huge impression on me. It was really the last of the big World's Fairs which is sad because they were an experience that everyone should have the chance to enjoy.

This one, as most of them were, really focused on technology and the future of our world and while a lot of what they showed us never came to be; video telephones and flying cars are two that I remember, it was still an amazing and positive experience for a nine year old to see what is possible and how we got to where we are.

The country exhibits were fascinating to me as well, since that time I've traveled all over the world both for business and pleasure and I really believe that this fair is what planted the travel bug in my nature.

I'm glad that there's someone out there who's preserving the memory of the fair so that those of us that were lucky enough to experience it can relive it again and those who never got to go and see what a wonder it was. Maybe someday events like this will come back and inspire a whole new generation of children to aspire to achieve new and wondrous things. I know I'd be there!",1470873600,2,1263,4.126016260162602

7888740,4,6305396841,"I have this DVD and it is very good. It tells perspectives of the fair and remembering it only as a young boy, it helps to refresh those memories.
I have to say that if you can find the film ""Peace Through Understanding"" by BBQ Productions they do a great job of going into the fair in detail. It's a little hard to find that DVD set but if you can, it is worth the purchase.
If you combine both the Hirsch DVD and that one, it give you a pretty good perspective of the fair and will help you jog some of those forgotten memories. If you are to young to remember the fair or were not born yet, you are in for a treat as it shows a special time when New York City hosted a ""Disney"" like theme park and exposition that will probably never be again at least in that city.",1454284800,,768,3.9612903225806453
