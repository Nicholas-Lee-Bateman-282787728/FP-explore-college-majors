8106277,5,B000E5RK6I,This film shows how power can be abused against American citizens.  Many of the 5 that went to jail enlisted in WW2 and fought for this country.  Gus Hall served in the US Navy. They were patriots.  I only hope that abuse of power does not happen again during Donald Trump's Presidency.  The Constitution must be followed by all branches of government and if not it needs to be called out by the press and enforced by the Supreme Court.  We cannot allow a dictatorship or abuse of American Citizens arising in the US.,1480550400,2,517,4.457446808510638
8106278,5,B000E5RK6I,"A democracy is many things, and this documentary shows the sordid, ugly, diabolical side.  I had to watch it twice in a row to absorb how some people, under the guise of protecting ""rights"" were themselves demons hiding behind their concept of liberty, and deciding what shouldn't be allowed in this country because it was deemed ""unamerican"".  It's vicious, it's calculated, it's cutthroat and it was accepted - for a while.  Maybe fear, maybe apathy, maybe a 'go along to get along' attitude allowed this type of action by elected government representatives.  Whatever the case, they used their power in the worst ways and made no excuses.  It's frightening to think how some Americans in positions of authority misused that authority and without a pang of conscience, virulently abused American citizens.  It's a wonder our nation didn't become more like a police state than one professed to have liberty and justice for all.",1471305600,3,928,5.032679738562091
