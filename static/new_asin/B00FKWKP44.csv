5998349,5,B00FKWKP44,"I recently purchased David Kahns DVD titled Mastering Krav Maga  Firearm Defenses Volume III.  WOW! This DVD series compliments Mr. Kahns excellent book Krav Maga Weapon Defenses.  The DVD series is a comprehensive overview of handgun defense principles and practical defenses to all types of handgun and long-gun threats.

I have had the distinct privilege of training with some of the greatest combative and martial arts instructors during my 31-year law enforcement career.  David Kahn is one of the greats!  If you are truly interested in learning how to defend yourself against an armed adversary, you really need to spend your hard earned money and purchase this DVD series.  Once you buy it, practice, practice and practice.  Hopefully, you will never need the vital skills that you will learn from this DVD series however, if you do, I sincerely believe you will WIN the encounter.",1386720000,2,889,5.082758620689655
5998350,5,B00FKWKP44,"Being a former bouncer I dropped my practice of martial arts at a young age after having my first gun pulled on me, shortly after that I witnessed an actual brawl at a karate and hapkido tournament where a knife made an appearance. I was half way through David's third series when I contacted him about weapons training, the conversation was enlightening. Not knowing David's background with actual weapon's encounters I did notice the very similar choice of words to those of many experienced weapons fighters whom I know and have worked with. I am not a martial artist but more of a puritan with more experience with violence than most black belts I have trained with and David touched on what my experience has shown me to be the most important element of weapons training, that being the chaos surrounding an attack and the dangers in rigid scenario training.
 The dvd's themselves are brilliantly subtle and stripped down of any hollywood scenarios, the participants are all student's and that brings the reality of people learning together and improving together, a nice change from mock road rage skit's and hands on the hips lectures from fake commando's.
 I always suggest that David's books accompany the dvd's for more in depth learning and a great package for any student who doesn't have an IKMA instructor in their region.
 If you do own other system's material on Krav Maga or weapon's defences, you'll recognize the mastery at which is being presented here, and if you don't own any others, feel good knowing that you won't have to jump from system to system..You've found the only source you'll need right here.",1384992000,13,1628,4.848920863309353

5998352,5,B00FKWKP44,"Having bought Mr. Kahn's Mastering Krav Maga volumes I and II, volume III was at the top of my list to purchase.  Just like volumes I and II volume III did not disappoint and can take its place at the top of Krav Maga instructional DVD's along side the first 2.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning weapons ( handgun, rifle, ) defense from beginner to advanced.  If you are new to Krav Maga I would highly recommend buying all 3 volumes of Mastering Krav Maga to cover all aspects of self defense.",1382054400,2,524,4.326530612244898

5998366,5,B00FKWKP44,"One of the most comprehensive self defence DVDs available.  Not only are techniques easy to understand and clearly demonstrated, but they are also kept realistic and practical.  So many gun defence instructors and techniques are fancy, cool to watch and would look great in the movies.  Unfortunately these techniques are also great for getting people killed.

This disk set sticks to real techniques that will work for real people in real life threatening situations.  It is not intended to be a Hollywood gun fight video but is geared towards individuals  to who are serious about learning how to save their lives or the lives of their loved ones should they ever be in such a dangerous situation.  A wonderful representation why Krav Maga is the ultimate in self defence training.  I would highly recommend this dvd set to anyone serious about learning true Krav Maga.  The material on this set could undoubtedly save your life one day.",1422316800,,939,4.929936305732484
5998367,4,B00FKWKP44,"David Kahn has presented a solid and constructive view of real Krav Maga which is refreshing a gladly appreciated. This is real deal defensive tactics. While this isn't a ""blue print"" to black belt, Krav Maga isn't really supposed to be such a thing in the first place. Persons wishing to buy a belt in a box type training program will be disappointed.

Mr. Kahn has taken the time to line out the main system concepts as well as display the proper way they should be utilized. Combative instruction should be simple, easy to learn, and effective. David has presented this material in a way that does exactly that.

I have been training in martial arts for 34 years, I am a military and law enforcement veteran (certified LE Instructor), and I currently own/operate a martial arts/defensive tactics training facility. My personal opinion is that this is one of the best DT DVD sets available to the general public and at a very fair price. Don't hesitate to buy this...these DVD's are a great product.",1420934400,2,1001,4.714285714285714
5998368,5,B00FKWKP44,"David Khan is one of the worlds best in authentic Krav Maga.
There are so many groups out there now that supposedly teach Krav Maga but are fake or just train like cardio kickboxing.
These DVDs are amazing, often brutal but extremely effective techniques.

I would highly recommend investing the money for the 3 sets currently available from Mr Khan, I have all 3 and the books to accompany them and it is a fabulous investment in personal safety.
I have been involved and teaching martial arts for 26 years now and am disappointed in how politics and sport has taken over the martial aspect of the arts.

5998370,5,B00FKWKP44,"With this DVD set I conclude my collection of David Kahn's publications of books and DVD sets. I'm glad I have purchased this collection and resource of Krav Maga material. As I have stated before, this is the most comprehensive material produced bu one instructor in my opinion. This particular DVD set is full of options that may give the practitioner an added chance at survival from a dangerous and vicious threat. If you are serious about practicing Krav Maga, this set will be an added asset to your training. All of the materials from this instructor are quality products. Highly recommend it.",1415836800,4,600,4.834951456310679
5998371,5,B00FKWKP44,"Having spent the last 25 years in the military, law enforcement, and intelligence communities, I have been exposed to both the best and worst of training programs.  This video, along with the books and other videos in this series are definitely among the BEST.  The material in this DVD is presented extremely well and contains no secret or magical techniques.  Instead, the serious nature of this training is made clear because of the lethal threat presented by an assailant.  The techniques presented are straight forward and use the principles of speed, surprise, and violence of action along with economy of motion.  In my humble opinion, this material should be seriously considered by ALL military, LE, and security communities to enhance survival of their personnel.  Most defensive tactics/combatives programs fail to address  confrontations by a violent assailant with an edged weapon or firearm.  If you are a member of one of these professions, you know what I mean.  This video is an excellent and viable way to fill the void in your program.
I would like to offer my thanks and appreciation to David Kahn and all members of IKMA for making this material available.  It has and will continue to save lives.",1409184000,,1218,4.985148514851486
5998372,5,B00FKWKP44,"This DVD set is an outstanding tutorial! David shows you how the technique looks at full speed; then, he slows it down to show the moves, and at different angles. He shows you how to surprise and stun--or disable--your attacker. About two days after reviewing all 3 discs, I went shopping at a local store for a few items.  I had my cell phone in my hand , leisurely shopping, when this young scrubby looking fellow asked to use my cell phone.  He asked me twice and I told him no twice. When he asked the second time, I had to give him a firm stare that my answer was still NO! He walked away mumbling something to the affect that he could take my phone if he wanted to. Well. He kept walking and I kept shopping without further incident. With David's teachings still fresh on my mind, I was prepared to defend me and my cell phone's honor should that fellow have tried anything. I can't use most of David's teachings on my job. But having the knowledge of Israeli Krav Maga helps you to be prepared at any given moment: Get out of the line of fire and stun simultaneously with force FIRST; then, go into your combatives. This DVD set is great for females who work in law enforcement or not. It's worth the $55.99!!",1409011200,,1216,4.3056768558951966

David goes through many different angles and scenarios on gun defenses , very in depth as he explains the moves and why he does them, pure real Krav Maga unlike some of the other DVDs i have seen , this set is the real deal, with Dave you will learn from the best so forget the rest ! Dave trains closely with the grand master Haim Gidon to bring to you the authentic Israeli Krav , if your serious about your gun defenses look no further, also if your serious about all that Dave and his instructors have to offer you can visit him at the Bordentown NJ training center. And do check out all his other excellent DVDs as well as the books he has to offer on here, I have them and all are extremely well done .

5998375,5,B00FKWKP44,"This is my first DVD set from David Kahn and I have no regrets purchasing it. Mr. Kahn states up front that he has focused on putting together a useful and informative DVD that does not waste time on using Hollywood gimmicks or glam. I have no problem with this.

I do not own any of his books and I believe he states during the introduction that these videos are meant to accompany his books which I presume cover the related Krav Maga techniques in greater depth, but the content on these DVDs is robust and thorough. He thoroughly explains each technique and demonstrates it full speed and slow speed from multiple angles. He breaks down the techniques and provides reasons why and how some defenses may need to be modified according to the circumstances that the defender is facing at the time of an attack.

David provides as many situational scenarios in this volume as one can reasonably expect on this type of media.  If any one has questions on something that isn't clear, I'm sure you can contact him for clarification. Ultimately you can only get so much out of a DVD without having to seek the guidance of a competent Krav Maga instructor for live instruction. However, if this isn't possible, these DVDs are valuable tools by themselves. I intend to purchase his previous Krav Maga volumes at a later date because I was impressed with the information included in this volume.",1400371200,,1388,4.6571428571428575
5998376,5,B00FKWKP44,"""This is a MUST BUY, DVD for any of my law enforcement brothers out there. This DVD and the rest of David's DVDs will help you make it home one day.

Thank you David for providing me with the means to protect my loved ones and myself from future threats.""",1398211200,2,393,4.253333333333333
5998377,5,B00FKWKP44,"A good friend loaned me his David Kahn DVD set and I thought the lessons were fantastic.  I had to return the DVD's to my friend, so I bought my own set!  I've been enjoying martial arts practice for over thirty five years and have many books, tapes and DVD's.  There is none better than this set of lessons from Mr. Kahn.  He is a fabulous instructor with terrific technical ability and knowledge.  He shares his knowledge freely in this outstanding set of lessons and I would recommend this to martial artists of all styles.  I am thoroughly happy with the DVD set and the great service from Amazon as well.  Thank you.",1396742400,,621,4.442477876106195
5998378,5,B00FKWKP44,"This set is a true must-have for anyone who trains in Krav Maga or any other self-defense system for that matter, as it will serve as an invaluable supplement to your training. I am a student at David's school, where I am witness to his mastery of skill and fierce intensity. He brings the same energy to his DVDs, where he expertly explains the techniques, breaking them down into their component parts and demonstrating from multiple angles. He performs them at full speed and also slowly, all while explaining himself in a clear and concise manner. I also own Volumes I & II of Mastering Krav Maga, which I watch frequently to reinforce the subtleties of the skills we learn in class.

If you're interested in firearm defenses, you'll be very happy you bought Volume III.  If you're looking for a complete self-defense system that includes hand-to-hand as well as knife & edged-weapon defenses, then you should also own Volumes I & II.  It's a small investment considering these lessons will always be at your disposal, taught to you by one of Krav Maga's top instructors.",1395360000,2,1075,4.768817204301075
5998379,5,B00FKWKP44,"Wow - great DVD set! David K.covers the fundamental techniques for Long & Short guns, but what is unique about these DVDs is that he also covers many variations that can occur from different positions. You don't see this depth in many other weapons defense DVDs. He provides clear explanations and why he thinks the approaches he is using work best.

He shows you multiple angles to see the techniques. The videos also go beyond what a typcial martial artist would likely encounter and ventures into scenarios more geared toward law enforcement & military - such as defense vs. bayonets and hostage situations. I practice Okinawan Karate - not KM. I have to say this is probably the best DVD on weapons defense that I have seen. Well worth the money.",1395273600,,750,4.7251908396946565

8616529,5,B00FKWKP44,"Everything this guy has is worth learning, if you want to survive in a lethal encounter.",1529539200,,88,4.5625
8616530,5,B00FKWKP44,"Bottom line up front.  David Kahn and his team are, by far, the best there is, and teach the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement (LE), or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.

Historically, development of Self-defense systems and martial arts occurred from the necessities of the existing time-period and social norms concerning violence.  For example, Karate for the Samurai or Kali for villagers of the Philippines (whose conflicts were tribal and weapons of choice where whatever they had laying around).  Societies developed these systems and martial arts in order to, quickly and efficiently, train Soldiers. This was so they would possess the capabilities to close with and destroy their adversaries in hand-to-hand combat if and when necessary.  Imi Lichtenfeld designed Israeli Krav Maga in the 1940s in order to address the modern combatant.  Whether dealing with a mugger on the streets, or a foreign adversary on the battlefield. No other system is as modern or effective as Krav Maga.

The IKMA (GS) is the only true Krav Maga system under Grand Master Haim Gidon (successor to Imi Lichtenfeld).  It is, by far, any agencies best option for training its Soldiers and/or LE officers.  A single ten-hour seminar with David Kahn, and his team, proved to be worth a year of training in any other dojo I have attended.  I have trained on several forms of martial arts and self-defense systems.  I always shop around for the best instructor with the most practical training.  David and his team are undeniably the best there is.  I have driven fourteen hours at a time, on several occasions, to attend training with him.  I always leave the seminars absolutely motivated to come back to base and share what I learned with my Soldiers.

Krav Maga has grown in popularity in the west in recent decades.  There are several different interpretations of the system available in the US (e.g. Warrior Krav Maga /Krav Maga World Wide).  Most of them teach substandard techniques, with the addition of cardiovascular endurance training, in order to appeal to those more susceptible to advertising and marketing.  The idea being, Get fit and learn to defend yourself overnight.  While Krav Maga is designed to be simple to understand.  There still needs to be much emphasis on the subtle fine points that make any technique effective.  Far removed from the source, these schools often sacrifice proper technique for mass production.  This can have fatal consequences when someone uses those techniques for actual self-defense.  I have also frequented several introductory courses where the facility told me they strictly focus on civilian self-defense.  There are three tiers to Krav Maga (Military, Civilian, and Law Enforcement).  Any master of the system should know and be able to instruct them all.  As a Law Enforcement Officer, I also have a firm understanding of the Use of Force (UOF) continuum.  I also understand the legal ramifications for not understanding the UOF continuum.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are true masters of the system. They will ensure that the student gets every detail and piece of knowledge they require for the techniques they are taught to be effective.

Israeli Krav Maga under the IKMA (GS) is also a great plug and play system. If your agency has an existing system where you believe there are gaps in its current techniques, or dilemmas which your system does not address, Krav Maga will fill those gaps easily.  I have personally found this to be applicable for LE systems, military combatives, and other martial arts/self-defense systems alike.

Additionally, if you attend the seminars to get hands on training, and a professional instructors critique on your form (which I highly recommend), the DVDs and books hold nothing back in terms of helping you to refresh your memory.  The five books (approximately 1000 pages worth of instructional material) are extremely well articulated and literally spell out every detail you need to know from a strategic approach.  They articulate all the subtle nuances, which make a technique work.  The four DVD volumes (approximately 27 hours of instructional material) do an excellent job of using a by the numbers approach to teaching and demonstrating the technique, as well as elaborating on key points.  For those who have served in an instructor position, in either the military or law enforcement, the previously mentioned materials more than portray a Training Support Package (TSP) or Program of Instruction (POI).  In addition, the materials previously mentioned will entirely refresh your techniques acquired by any seminar attended in person with David.

Once again, bottom line up front.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are by far the best there is, teaching the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement, or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.",1526169600,,5108,5.056152927120669
