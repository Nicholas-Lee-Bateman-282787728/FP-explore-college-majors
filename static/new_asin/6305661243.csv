7893082,5,6305661243,To have it all and loose it all in gambling is payback for gaining everything the same way.  Lucha Villa plays the unhappy woman who misses the action of the palenque. Fast pacing story with plenty of action.,1307836800,,208,4.473684210526316

7893084,5,6305661243,"I enjoy old Mexican movies and this is up there with the best. Ignacio Tarzo puts in a strong perfomance as the little puebla's
cryer. This movie has drama, story and excellent singing by ranchera queen, Lucha Villa. A beautiful and warm movie.",1011312000,5,244,4.6976744186046515
