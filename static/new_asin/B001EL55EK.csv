8298605,5,B001EL55EK,"Relive in a lighthearted and kid friendly manner, the timeless Biblical account of Ruth, one of the ancestors of King David. From her humble beginnings as a Moabite woman struggling with the sudden loss of her husband, and her loyalty and love for her mother-in-law Naomi, to her elevation as the wife of Boaz, a wealthy Israelite in whose field she gleaned the fallen shafts of wheat; this timeless classic will warm your heart, and teach your children the time honored traditions of love, loyalty, and trust in the Lord. Having enjoyed this, and many other videos from this company, I recommend it to everyone as being well worthwhile. As an interesting side note: Richard Rich, who helped to produce many of these, and other fine classics, worked for Walt Disney for many years before starting his own business in the animation field. Many of the employees he initially hired originally worked for Disney as well.",1310428800,2,916,4.878205128205129
