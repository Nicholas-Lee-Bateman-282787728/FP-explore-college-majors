8151091,3,B000JJSJDW,"Paid to Kill is a decent film with good dialog, decent acting, and interesting story. The picture is just OK to look at, but the audio is very noisy. The Glass Tomb started with below-average picture, which was very grainy and soft; therefore, I did not continue watching it.",1355184000,,275,4.63265306122449
8151092,4,B000JJSJDW,"This series of films noir feature B movies made at Bray Studio in the years before Hammer shifted into the horror genre.

These films are, frankly, British attempts to ape America - using an American star and a British cast.  As such, they are now very interesting windows on the English post-War scene - shell-scarred London, suburban side streets, working people just about making a living.

You only get this sort of truth in B movies, because the film-makers couldn't afford to build sets - so they took their cameras onto the streets.

I've bought - and recommend - all these volumes.  On this particular set, ""The Glass Tomb"" has a poorer picture quality than the other films in the series.",1174694400,8,696,4.7190082644628095
8151093,5,B000JJSJDW,"VCI Entertainment and Kit Parker Films present ""Hammer Film Noir Vol. 5"" (1955) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Film noir has sources not only in cinema but other artistic mediums as well...the low-key lighting schemes commonly linked with the classic mode are in the tradition of chiaroscuro and tenebrism, techniques using high contrasts of light and dark developed by 15th- and 16th-century painters associated with Mannerism and the Baroque...film noir's aesthetics are deeply influenced by German Expressionism, a cinematic movement of the 1910s and 1920s closely related to contemporaneous developments in theater, photography, painting, scultpture, and architecture...opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and, later, the threat of growing Nazi power led to the emigration of many important film artists working in Germany who had either been directly involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners...Directors such as Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, and Michael Curtiz brought dramatic lighting techniques and a psychologically expressive approach to mise-en-scne with them to Hollywood, where they would make some of the most famous of classic noirs. Lang's 1931 masterwork, the German M, is among the first major crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, one in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). M was also the occasion for the first star performance by Peter Lorre, who would go on to act in several formative American noirs of the classic era.
