1933021,5,B0000E32WV,"A hillarious spoof of the Godfather, et al with Harvey Keital as a mobster, and Gerard DePerdeau as french crook trying to get back to France alive, after he and his co-horts accidently kidnap mobster keitel. WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED truly a funny movie

ABOUT MOVIE:
These guys were given one last chance to pull off a job without screwing up. Guess what happened? Chicago's biggest mob boss doesn't like being robbed, and he's out for blood. So are the guys whose car got stolen as the gang's getaway vehicle. And then there's the dirty federal agent and the double-dealing crime lord who handed them the assignment. If they get out of this alive, it'll be a miracle. A mob hit starring Harvey Keitel (""Pulp Fiction"") and Gerard Depardieu (""The Man in the Iron Mask."")",1147996800,7,767,4.723880597014926
1933022,4,B0000E32WV,"An amusing crime-based comedy that runs the gauntlet of robbery, murder, blackmail, and a surprisingly amusing phonesex moment.  The acting is wonderfully done, one the best roles I believe Abe Vigoda  has been offered.

Grard Depardieu, Harvey Keitel, and Renaud pull off their characters flawlessly, which is saying something because they're dark characters that are injecting some serious comedy.

In the end, everyone involved with this movie should definately be proud of their effort, because it's definately worth seeing.",1103587200,12,528,5.6455696202531644

1933025,5,B0000E32WV,"Crime Spree is brilliant parody of many film genres (crime/mafia, fish out of water, comedy of errors). The performances by Grard Depardieu (Daniel Foray), Albert Dray (Raymond Gayet), Johnny Hallyday (Marcel Burot), and Renaud (Zero) were excellent.",1078185600,5,250,5.783783783783784
1933026,4,B0000E32WV,"I don't know how I stumbled onto this DVD, but my blind purchase (I do that sometimes) was a success. There are some moments in this movie that are laugh-out-loud funny. All of the French actors in this film are legends in France for one reason or another (some of them are famous music artists) and the nearly always excellent Harvey Keitel and Abe Vigoda also star.
The French thieves appear to be bumbling idiots at first, but despite appearances they get it together as the movie progresses, so don't expect non-stop slapstick humour. The laughs are sometimes in the more subtle situation-comedy moments. There are some tense and surprisingly violent scenes too. At times the script was clichd (""you must either be brave or very stupid to be here"") and I also felt like a better editor could have salvaged some of the jokes (and punchlines)...there were a few times where there were pauses before or after a joke that felt a bit too: oh i see, you want me to laugh now, right?. I also dislike the premise in movies, where everyone is a potential traitor (which is a cheap and easy way for allowing lots of plot twists to complicate things).
The DVD: Nothing except for the director & producer commentary, which is, by the way, very interesting. And I don't mean that in a good way. I advise you to NOT listen to the commentary, because you may suddenly notice a lot more flaws in the film that more seasoned directors (who, granted, probably would have bigger budgets) would have not let go unnoticed. The director/writer Brad Mirman is not a dumb guy, but he's clearly inexperienced and perhaps a bit too pleased with his (debut?) film -- ie. 'oh I love this next scene'.
Look past my complaints, this film has a fresh and funny approach on a tired (mafia & fish out of water) theme, with funny and inspired performances all round. Recommended.",1074124800,25,1849,4.623100303951368
1933027,5,B0000E32WV,"This DVD is like finding a $20 bill laying in the street.  What a great find.  Much more than I ever expected.  I laughed and I broke a sweat.  Great characters, engaging plot, good acting. Being a fan of foreign films, this one is in my top 5 of the last year.  The Direction was SUPERB (Take note of the bullet to closing eyelid camera shot...BRILLIANT! Speilberg, eat your heart out)
Well worth the rent. Starting from the first scene, it progressed into a Must See!
RENT THIS DVD!",1073347200,,484,4.393258426966292
1933028,4,B0000E32WV,"Crime Spree at first sounds like a serious crime drama, yet after you watch it you will not think so.  It's about a bumbling group of French thieves who are sent to the US to pull of a heist that will set things straight for their boss back in France.  I won't give any more plot details away, (save that for the box), but it certainly is funny.  I wasn't thinking it was going to be as funny as it was, but I laughed almost through the entire film.  The most surprising thing is that these were genuine laughs, not forced as with most comedies these days.  Crime Spree is a fresh look at a genre that has grown very tiresome.  Highly suggested for fans of crime gone awry films and for anyone looking to laugh a few hours away.  The DVD doesn't offer anything other than a trailer and commentary.",1073260800,2,797,4.23841059602649

1933090,2,B0000E32WV,"This is a very mediocre crime film with some humor, some very annoying cutesy editing, and some very annoying people.  There are several funny events, but most of the movie is hugely complicated and hard to follow.  This is especially true because there are many scenes either all in French or mostly in French, and this DVD HAS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES REPEAT HAS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES.  The entire opening scene is in French.  So you are trapped for periods of time with French, French, French, and you have no idea what is being said.

I won't go as far as another reviewer did, and question their authenticity; I know that there are ""different strokes for different folks.""  But neither I nor my husband could make it through even half-an-hour of this.  It was simply atrociously bad.  The slapstick gags weren't just tired, you could see them coming 3 minutes before they arrived, and even when executed, were executed poorly.

From the start, you see the so-called punchlines and gags coming; from the time the bumbling idiot lights a Zippo, you already know what's going to happen, and it actually made me sigh in disappointment to see the result.  Then the crime lord decides to send 3 of the most inept boobs you ever met to the US, to pull off a heist?  WHY?  He even tells Depardieu's character that the idiots with him are useless idiots.  So he pays to send them to the US, for a crime?  Uhhhhhhnnn....???

Keitel's performance, unusually for him, isn't even phoned in.  His first appearance?  I swear, it was like he was reading the line from a cue-card off to camera-right, a line he hadn't seen before.  Like he was reading it cold, and giving it his best, half-hearted shot, never thinking for a second that it would actually go anywhere but the cutting room floor.  In fact, that's where most of this film should have been--on the cutting room floor.  It was THAT bad.  And this from a guy who normally chews up the scenery...sad, sad, sad.

I didn't see anything to laugh about, not even anything to make me smile.  I was so completely turned off by this movie's ineptitude that I can't tell you what the plotline was about, past the ""idiots arrive in America while we see Harvey Keitel reading lines from an off-screen cue-card"" point.

I wanted to like this movie, because I like the movie stars that are in it, but this didn't even rise to the level of a bad made-for-Cloo movie.  It's THAT bad.  If you want a wasted afternoon, and have nothing else to watch...well, find something else.  It's certainly not my cup of tea.  It's not a mystery, it's not an adventure, it lacks action, and it absolutely lacks ""funny.""  I'd be interested to meet a real-live person who could tell me face-to-face that they loved this film.  Maybe it gets funny later on, but I'm not the kind of person who can sit through 45 minutes of horrid to get to one laugh.

This movie about a group of inept French criminals sent to the United States on a job, find themselves caught up in multiple double-crosses and under fire from the Chicago Mafia.  The French crew, led by Gerard Depardieu, are a motley crew but, as it turns out, a likeable bunch.

My reason for a bad rating has nothing to do with the movie but Midwest Pawn who sold it to me as ""Like New"" and it was and old Hollywood Movie rental with several bad scratches. When I told them about it they said I was wrong. This DVD could not be watched do to the damage and a less than reputable seller.

1933527,2,B0000E32WV,"CRIME SPREE (2003), is an acquired taste for some viewers,
considering has limited commercial potential in the USA, from the
fact that at least 2 French music superstars - Johnny Halliday and
Renaud - are absolute, total unknowns anywhere else than in France.

Because musicians are trained in music, and not acting, most
viewers' may also shy away from renting this DVD, if not for the
sometimes difficult accents of the actors when they read their
lines.

The DVD benefits from the well-accepted and legendary actors Harvey
Keitel, playing a caporegime/ pesonovante in the Chicago area, and
Gerard Depardieu - both with millions of fans internationally,
bringing their natural presence to the work. Abe Vigoda, often
typecast as a soldier in the mob ( Puzzo's Godfather) or as the
number 1, in this work, is also present.

Focusing on the Chicago area underworld of Black and Hispanic
gangs, Italian mob, corrupt FBI agents, the movie has no goal in
limiting itself to a rabid, close-minded crime story.

Rather, there's a 50/50 fusion of comedy, satire, lighter moments
throughout the picture, some gags more effective than others, joined
with the necessary other serious ones in the story, so as to not
disrespect the viewers who are there not for the humor, but for the
tense, thrill and action aspects. So, the film packs entertainment
for both publics, the serious and the silly minded, the masculine
and the feminine combined into one.

The DVD consciously made a point of being stylish, classy in a
certain sense perhaps from its European roots. e.g. perhaps 30 or
more scenes of Paris, and as many in Chicago, of famous landmarks,
are shown, suggesting a international cooperation or fraternity
between America and France, at least in the underworld.

Of course, the required controversial elements are introduced, such
as strip clubs, peep shows, pistols and shotguns, switchblades,
muggings, baseball bat assaults. The movie also is resolute in its
decision in only showing 1970's vintage American cars driven by the
gang members, as if to perpetuate a certain stereotype that's sunk
into the minds of the cinephiles.

The soundtrack is as talented and discerning in its selections as is
are the styling visuals, emphasizing the entertainment and ""feel
good"" aspect of the overall work.",1270166400,,2298,5.095744680851064

How to describe this film? Put the word ""bad"" in front of any component of a film,  and you've got it. Bad Tarantino/Lock Stock/Get Shorty knock-off. Bad writing. Bad directing. Bad acting. Bad cinematography. Bad continuity. Bad decision for Keitel and Depardieu. Bad rental choice. I made it through about 20 minutes before I reached for the Pepto Bismol and anti-depressants.
