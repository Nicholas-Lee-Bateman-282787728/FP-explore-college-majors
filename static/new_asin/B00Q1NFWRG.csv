6853186,4,B00Q1NFWRG,"Well done, but definitely not a definitive documentary. Of course, not even The World at War was a detailed account of WW2 in ""only"" 26 episodes.

There are some unique insights not found elsewhere, even though I disagreed with about half of them. At least I had to ask myself why I disagreed. It's also a tad Franco-centric, not surprising given where it was made. For example, in Episode 1, they spend some time on the murder of French socialist Jean Jaures, who was really an insignificant figure in the grander scheme of things.

""The ""Making  Of"" Segment is unfortunately not in English, and the two bonus features that are in English are advertisements for a web site or video game. The marketing department strikes again...

I would place ""Apocalypse"" a bit behind the ten part ""First World War"" but better than ""World War One in Color"", both of which I also recommend.",1459209600,3,876,4.705882352941177

6853189,5,B00Q1NFWRG,"This is easily one of the finest documentaries ever created. The music, eerily monotone narration, and crystal clear imagery using modern re-coloring techniques add such a dreadful and gloomy atmosphere on top of the horrific war itself - this documentary will stick with you for a lifetime. I was addicted to this documentary when I first caught in on TV and watched it nearly anytime saw that it was on. Ive been wondering and waiting for this show to finally hit Bluray and im very pleased that it did. As a collector of World War I and II docs, this sits at the pinnacle of my collection.

From the same studio that brought Apocalypse World War II - I have noticed their modern re-coloring technique has massively improved here from the WWII show. The sound quality of the effects are also of a much higher quality. Watching an online making of vid of this show: a large percentage of the WWI footage has been recently unearthed for this show - as the digital restoration process is a painstakingly long process. Much of this footage has never been seen in any other doc.

I remember catching this series on the American Heroes channel (formerly the Military Channel) - this bluray is exact same version as was aired on that channel minus a different show intro. The English narrator is the same as heard on AHC and fits the show perfectly. This was a slight cause of concern for me as this studios previous documentary Bluray (Apocalypse World War II) changed the narrator from that which I saw aired on American TV. There are some new scenes too which I noticed which didn't air on TV - im guessing due to censoring.

To clear up confusion from some of the other reviews im seeing here: The Apocalypse World War I bluray is in both English and French languages. The bluray defaults to French narration though so you will have to manually change it to English in the options. The text displayed on the screen on the menus and the actual show itself announcing certain dates, names, and map screens are in French - strangely sometimes they are translated with subtitles and other times not - this is not a big deal and if this is the corners that needed to be cut to actually release this documentary on bluray ill gladly accept it.",1457136000,5,2236,4.571072319201995
6853190,5,B00Q1NFWRG,"If you are looking for the minutia of WWI, this is not it.  The producers have done an excellent job in giving a concise overview of not only the war, but of all the countries that participated.  (who knew Japan was involved!).  The narration, by Mr. Arnaud is a masterpiece.  It is done in generally a monotone which, by the end of the series, is chilling.
For those who watched this on AHC in the US each segment is at least 10 minutes longer that what was broadcast.
The US version of this program is in French and English, with French being the predominant language.  Just use the setup at the beginning to get English.
My only quibble is the ""Making of"" segment is in French with no subtitles.",1456790400,28,698,4.37984496124031

6853194,5,B00Q1NFWRG,"Brilliant production on the horrors of World War One especially in the hell hole of the Western Front. Everything about this production is excellent; the colorization is superb and gives footage we have seen many times before a new dimension; the English narration by Francois Arnaud is haunting and evocative-it brings the episodes to a new level; the production and overall structure is superb. Some of the visuals in the episodes will stay with you forever. It is also a very moving tribute to the courage of all the soldiers who fought in the war.
The set up to English narration is very straight-forward- a couple of clicks in the audio section will get you what you want.
I recommend this series to everyone. It is outstanding on all fronts and shows the human courage displayed by men who should not have lived in those oppressive conditions. The leaders and commanders who put them there are a disgrace to mankind.",1509667200,,922,4.76875

6853203,5,B00Q1NFWRG,"OUT AND AWAY THE BEST DOC ON THIS WAR. I wish there WERE a way to give it more stars. Okay, is it a pain to set up in English? Yes, that takes all of FIVE MINUTES to figure out -- patience, people, patience! And is it as detailed as some others, like ""The First World War""? Not quite, but then, it's not quite so monstrously prejudicial and pro-British, either. It takes the point of view of NO side, but rather of that of the soldiers and peoples of ALL sides, and concludes, quite correctly, that this war was not only NOT ""the war to end all wars,"" but the prelude to another, greater one; a triumph of idiotic generals who threw millions of lives away, leaving only bitter survivors who ALL demanded vengeance: some, like the French and British, got it in the short term, and some, like the Germans...later, and far more severely. WATCH THIS DOCUMENTARY: it has NO axe to grind, it's not French, it's French-Canadian: some of the people who fought hardest for the least reason with the most casualties.

 Unfortunately, I cannot play this Blu-ray in ENGLISH via my new Samsung Blu-Ray player.
 The play options within the on-screen TV control panel will not allow me to select English as the preferred language.
 The on screen options cannot be changed to my viewing and listening preferences.
 Some changes are allowed, but these limited changes do not provide ENGLISH as the spoken language.
 How may I make the changes so a non-French speaking American may enjoy this excellent documentary of World War 1?

I truly need assistance because no one here in my community has been able to solve this riddle.

6853226,5,B00Q1NFWRG,"WOW! Fantastic documentary. I cannot recommend it highly enough.  The narration and the colorization of archival black and white film footage really brings history and war to life. It was so interesting seeing the key political players and members of the monarchies at work and play, e.g. Wilhelm II, Nicholas II and King George V.  I think the writers, producers and director did a great job. I learned a lot, too.

This film reminded me of Ken Burns' production, the ""Civil War,"" except this pertained to WW I.

Some reviewers have given this a one or two stars because they were unable to configure the dvd/blu-ray disc for English. I was able to select English easily using the ""Setup"" drop down list. It is shaded when selected.  Their problem was ""operator error"" not a problem with the disc.

I loved this documentary and am going to purchase ""Apocalypse - World War II"" now!",1462838400,11,882,4.73202614379085
6853227,4,B00Q1NFWRG,"I've been a student of The First World War since I was a child, and have seen just about every documentary on this most pivotal of conflicts. I have to say 'Apocalypse WWI' in my opinion is among the best of them. The series conveys the horror and pointlessness of what I've come to call 'the most needless in our long history of needless wars.' Today we live in the giant shadow cast by The Great War; present-day struggles in the Middle East and Africa have their roots in the aftermath of WWI.

'Apocalypse' does a wonderful job of covering the politicians and generals--the so-called 'great men'--while emphasizing the individual soldiers point of view through never-before-seen film clips, personal letters and even poetry and prose written by soldiers of all the combatant nations. Last but not least, the film used in the series has been restored and colorized, and these elements add an extra dimension to what is seen on the screen.

There is a sense of foreboding and fear from the first episode; one gets the feeling the Great War was inevitable. The great monarchies of Europe with their militaristic leaders, ridiculous uniforms, parading soldiers and huge yachts are contrasted with the suffering of the filthy working masses slaving away in factories and mines. A great powder keg was sitting there, waiting for the fuse to be set off.

I purchased the set on Amazon Instant Video, and have watched it more times than I can count. All the episodes are riveting, but the one that really stands out is Episode 3, 'Hell', which chronicles 1916, what the great military historian John Keegan called 'The Year of Battles'. The horror of Verdun and the outright butchery of the Somme are painful to watch 100 years after the events took place. Many details are presented, such as the Allies failed attempts at making masks to keep their troops safe from terrible poison gas attacks. A segment is also shown about how the two sides developed their unique helmets, which quickly came to symbolize the nations involved.

I have one major issue to criticize about 'Apocalypse WWI', and it also involves Episode 3. It is the glaring omission of the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the biggest naval confrontation of the war. It marked the one time the whole of the German High Seas Fleet sallied out to confront the Royal Navy in full battle array. Perhaps time constraints didn't allow for it, but Jutland was very significant from a strategic standpoint: Germany failed to break the British naval blockade of their ports, which played a big role in the final Allied victory in Europe in November 1918.

It's also true that every detail isn't included in the series. Five hours are insufficient to cover everything in a war that involved much of the planet. No doubt viewers of some national backgrounds will be disappointed events in the series don't have enough information to satisfy them.

All in all, 'Apocalypse WWI' is an excellent documentary. I feel anyone considering going into the military around the world should see this series. Far too often young people fall for the glorification of war, and do not understand the horrors that occur once a conflict begins. How many times over the centuries have we heard the phrases 'it'll be quick' or 'it will be over in a few weeks'?",1462492800,12,3287,4.808849557522124
