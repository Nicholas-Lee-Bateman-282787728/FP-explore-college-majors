8572871,3,B00BQXTDEO,"This was not what I was expecting. It was still interesting though.  I just found it too long.  After the third or fourth painting, watching and listening to art experts examine several unframed masterpieces and discuss them became somewhat monotonous.  I'm sure some art geeks will find this documentary more interesting than I did.",1429660800,2,333,5.12962962962963

8572873,4,B00BQXTDEO,"This series provides an unique perspective on great western artists.  Each episode (about an hour) focuses on the private showings of many pictures by a master, each unframed and not behind glass, to a set of experts.  The video quality is extremely good and you get to see how the masterpieces are old worn objects that have been preserved and inadvertently defaced over time.  The vast majority of each episode focuses on the art and the facts regarding their care but sections do devolve into experts arguing and speculating.  Setting aside that complaint, this is a very good series which, while showing beautiful images, discusses the cultural morays and the mechanics of painting, as well as preservation,",1401494400,8,711,5.051282051282051
8572874,4,B00BQXTDEO,"When one considers the flood of titles available on DVD for consumers to buy, it would be logical to surmise that the most commercial programs have the most value. In terms of making money for the distributor that may well be true, but in terms of aesthetic, artistic, educational and historical value, programs like UNDERSTANDING ART: HIDDEN LIVES OF MASTERPIECES are hard to beat. Of course the appeal of the subject matter is limited, but that in no way limits any measure of its importance.

What makes a painting (or any work of art) great? Its ability to inspire, provoke, elicit a variety of responses from awe and wonder to frustration and debate are a few things which come to mind. The premise of this five part series certainly builds on the theory that great art should inspire discussion. Bringing together a large group of art experts is, for the most part, a fascinating exercise to observe. Occasionally some of the people in the know come across as precious and arrogant, but that is to be expected in such a specialized field where large egos are to be found in abundance. For the most part, the comments and debate are spirited, interesting and fun.

The irony, of course, is that not a single one of the assembled guests has a fraction of the talent of any of the five featured artists. It is amusing to hear some of the theories put forth as to the artists original intention, or the evolution of such and such a painting (a bit of the canvas trimmed here, a repair made there). True, there is great intellect on display but it amounts to nothing in the presence of the timeless beauty of the art itself.

Do we really need the collective wisdom of the curators, historians, restorers and scientists before we can appreciate a great painting for what it is? No, we dont. But the insight of experts can sometimes assist in helping us to maximize our appreciation. Its a question of discernment. One might look at a painting of Rembrandts and decide I like this, but not be able to articulate why. This is where the perspective of one with a trained eye might help. Bearing this in mind may provide just the right amount of objectivity needed to enjoy this program for what it is: a journey of discovery.

Unquestionably the highlight of this series is part five. The genius of Leonardo Da Vinci cannot be encapsulated in a single painting because his talents were not contained to a single medium. Inventor, scientist, designeranything artistic and Leonardo was master. Watching his paintings discussed and details of his life (the little thats known) elevate this exercise in artistic appreciation to a new level.

The series is not so high brow as to exclude the less artistically informed. For example, the clever use of animation and the accompanying booklet all contribute to the producers worthwhile intention of educating the viewer in an accessible and entertaining fashion. Further, the animation references great art of another kind by using a crooked arm image borrowed from the great Saul Bass credit sequence for Otto Premingers film The Man With The Golden Arm.

Yes, this is specialized material, but by no means is it exclusive. And it is a wonderful reminder that any painting (or work of art) has a lot more to it than meets the eye.",1397433600,10,3271,4.729824561403508
