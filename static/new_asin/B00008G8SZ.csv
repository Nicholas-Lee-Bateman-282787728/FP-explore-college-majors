1844731,5,B00008G8SZ,"Alucarda is an erotic, psychedelic horror masterpiece from mexican director Juan Moctezuma.  It's both a work of art and a luridly entertaining exploitation shocker.  Moctezuma was a collaborator of Jodorowsky's and fans of that filmmaker's work will likely enjoy this.  You can also sense the influence of Mario Bava and Jean Rollin on Alucarda, the former in the rich use of color and the latter in the stylized erotic images.  The Mondo Macabro DVD looks fantastic and comes with some nice extras including a british doc about the director and an interview with filmmaker and Alucarda fan Guillermo Del Toro.  Some might recognize bits of dialogue from this film, which have been sampled by the Electric Hellfire Club and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult.",1075420800,14,759,4.992063492063492
1844732,4,B00008G8SZ,"Since this film is most likely going to be noticed and picked up by those who are also into other foreign ""horror""/skin flicks, I shall use Jean Rollin and Jess Franco as the comparison references.
Actually, there really IS no comparison. Alucarda is much more of a 'film' than anything those directors have put out, and really makes their cinematic incompetence stand out in sharp relief.
As a ""skin"" flick it's about on par with Franco's film roster or Rollin's vampire films: no ""sex scene"" per se, but fabulous full frontals (fairly lengthy) from a couple of beautiful actresses.
Story wise, it's much more coherent than theirs, as well. Even though it probably had about the same budget as an exploitation flick, it uses the money wisely and doesn't come off as being
cheaply made.
Overall, that is. The blood and effects are by current standards primitive, but quite effective nonetheless.
This is definitely not a vampire movie, but rather a film about your typical rebellious girl stuck in a convent who makes a pact with the devil and brings her innocent, wayward friend into it.
She then proceeds to ""raise hell"" so to speak within the convent. A witch hunt ensues within its walls, and the apocalyptic ending is very much in the vein of ""Carrie"".
It's only moderately heavy on skin and blood, so the storyline doesn't suffer as a result of flesh overkill. Alucarda's strongest point is the atmosphere which pervades it--an obscure, generic thing to say and hardly explanatory, I know, but you'll understand it when you see it.
I give it four stars based on the genre, comparing it to similar films. I'm not saying it's four stars on an ""Oscar"" level by any means. It's definitely worth a watch if you like foreign 70s vampire/horror films. Not scary, but great nudity and decent plot. Another plus is that it's in ENGLISH!!! No subtitles needed!",1072224000,15,1856,4.803125
1844733,4,B00008G8SZ,"Alucarda was obviously made to cash in on the success of the Exorcist. And on many levels, it succeeds. The film is about a young girl who lives in a convent, and takes a fellow young nymph into the woods, where they encounter some strange gypsies. These gypsies are, well, basically devil worshippers, and they seem to possess poor Alucarda, who wants nothing more than to have some fun in the woods, and escape the sin obsessed nuns of the convent, who seem to be wearing bloody bandages as habits. Well, from there the film gets very crazy, with lots of blood, screaming, and blasphemies, as Alucarda uses her new found power much the way Sissy Spacek did in Carrie. And from there, it's nuns vs. devil-chicks, and sheer lunacy. There is a disturbing scene towards the end with a crucufix, that worked well in the ""anything goes"" seventies, but would never work today. The film is erotic, disturbing, and just plain old fun, but certainly not for everybody. Very eerie, and atmospheric, and on a stormy October night I cant think of a better way to spend it than by watchin a film with as much guts as ""Alucarda"".",1063152000,4,1116,4.585

More blood, loud screaming and nudity then any horror film I can think of.
So I bought it, knowing full well it could be another Unhinged.  So,  I started watching it and the first thing that really stands out are the costumes of the nuns that are made to look like bloodied bandages.  And so, I made it through the first time and other then the nun's habbits, it wasn't that weird.  But then I was compelled to watch it again, and the second time it was like watching it for the first time!
This movie throws so much specticle, blood, screams, and general devilry at its audience it is like a hard rain that bounces off the ground and doesn't soak in.
This movie could be the greatest single horror movie in history and no one has ever heard of it!  Except for the guy quoted on the cover.
If you're a horror fan, you gotta get this.  If you're dating a horror fan and you don't really get ""this whole horror thing"" but you love your horror lover, then get him or her this and you will be well esteemed!  They may even think you understand them, which could have dire consequences.
Other then the movie, there are some interviews with people who knew the director, some guy named Juan Moctezuma and possibly a documentary, I don't really remember.  And then there is a text biography about him, which I didn't read because reading is passe and besides, I'm illiterate.
So, buy this movie now or you may not be able to look at yourself in the mirror because you will have become a vampire, or something.",1060214400,10,1600,4.327759197324415

1844795,3,B00008G8SZ,"If you have a high tolerance for LOTS of loud shouting, hysterical hand-wringing and gratuitous nudity, there's a lot to appreciate about ALUCARDA. The sets and location work are superb, and the camera work- following characters up and down stairs and corridors- almost never lets down the potential staginess of the sets. In fact, aside from the near-constant, distraught shouting- (one of the sisters says she's just down the hall, if she was needed, just call, and then there's ten minutes of screaming and she shows no interest) the only thing that TRULY let this down for me is the wooden acting from some of the male actors, the occasional OVER-acting of Alucarda herself (""Oy! AGAIN with the spinning and hair-gripping!""). The rest is Ken Russel-esque over-the-top, turned-up-to-eleven LOOPY and occasionally creepy. It's so manic even the awkward cuts between ""reels"" seem to work. Definitely NOT for those easily offended by blasphemous images.  Oh, and I thought the nuns outfits were VERY effective. Something about that slightly blood-stained GAUZE... really puts an exclamation mark on the mood that prevails.",1398211200,,1122,5.268156424581005
1844796,4,B00008G8SZ,"Alucarda is a pretty weird movie. There's a lot of screaming, speeches of Satan, and the relationship between to girls.

It's about a girl named Justine who comes to stay at this Catholic monastery or whatever it's called. She meets a girl named Alucarda and they become good friends. While out in the fields they come across this Rumpelstiltskin looking dude and some gypsies. They some how unleash a devil which them posses both of the girls. Justine turns vampire-like and bites a nuns neck. Alucarda goes all crazy and burns a bunch of people with he telekinesis power.

It's pretty hard to explain the movie, but all I can say that it's enjoyable in a strange way. I recommended it to people looking for something different.",1395100800,,729,4.732283464566929
1844797,5,B00008G8SZ,"A woman moves into a isolated countryside convent that is made of stone and has nuns dressed like mummies. At the convent upstairs, she meets Alucarda. Soon they wander the surrounding rural landscape and meet a satanic gypsie who appears to be harmless. Exploring the countryside further, they enter a stone burial site and open a casket. This unleashes an evil spirit that is apparently the cause for some or all of the satanic and demonic instances that follow.

This pictures film style may or may not be appealing. I thought a lot of the dialogue and acting resemble something like a stage play from the middle ages rather than a film; when I watch it, I feel like I'm sometimes watching an old fashioned play instead of watching a movie. The music and many sequences in the film may seem old fashioned and dated to some people, but these parts make the film unique to an extent. The exploitation content in the film is high with plentiful full nudity which includes some full male nude scenes, and the violence and gore is quite impactful at times. It doesn't have gore from beginning to end, but some scenes are worth mentioning. There's one scene during the climax when a girl emerges from a blood filled coffin to attack a nun like an animal by clawing and biting her on the neck. This scene stands out, as well as another scene where a possessed nun has her head hacked off by a cruel fanatical priest who had managed an exorcism where a fully nude women is pierced with needles. The movie is very explicit with a brisk pace, and there isn't really anything that I would consider to be filler in between the nudity and violence. The scenery and atmosphere is good as well, but the problem is that the movie may seem dated to some people because it doesn't have a modern film style.

The full screen DVD looks very good. I've had this DVD for awhile and I still watch it. The replay value is very good, as long as you're a big fan of 70s exploitation flicks.",1370304000,,1967,4.476323119777159

1844799,4,B00008G8SZ,"FULL REVIEW FROM FILMPHREAK.TUMBLR.COM
Nevermind the name. Its not a Dracula movie, or even a general vampire film. Though there is light-hating, cross-hating and the sort of behavior that goes along with vampires. Except this isn't vampires. No, this is a possession flick in a nunsploitation environment. Im guessing the Alucarda, though its the name of the chief possessee (yes, there are more than one), is a bit of name-dropping, since Alucardas friend (the other possessee) is named Justine, plus its after opening a coffin - just for funsies, you understand - with the name Lucy Westenra (I swear thats what it sounded like she said) on it that all the bad joojoo sets to. Although, really, I kind of took sides with Justine and Alucarda, who represent on one level youthful rebellion against overtight moral strictures of authority figures, here represented by a scary take on the Catholic church. Creepiest chapel ever. You have to see it. ALUCARDA has a dream fever flavor to it, no surprise given its direction by Juan Lopez Mocetzuma, the helmer of the surrealist arthouser The Mansion of Madness, an exercise in near-pure absurdism. But theres a linear tale told via the march of the bizarre. Everything from a nun praying so earnestly to God she floats and sweats/cries blood - a surprisingly holy showing out for a Satanic flick - to a Carrie meets The Exorcist finale that really brings down the house. Theres lots to gawk at  here, and the director has sewn it together in such a way as to create a film that is not only erotic, violent and shocking, but also artful, creative and smart about what its doing.",1362268800,,1625,4.803571428571429
1844800,5,B00008G8SZ,"There's no way to say this without coming off as something of an elitist cinema snob, so I'll go ahead and say it anyway. Some people can't see visual poetry, which means they can never really appreciate film as an art form. It's akin to be being color blind or tone deaf. Those are the sort of people that wrote the one- and two-star reviews for ALUCARDA. I'm overrating the film slightly and giving it five stars in an effort to counteract those clueless reviews.

The film's low budget shows (although the surreal set design of the convent is something to behold), and far from flawless, but, much more importantly, it is visionary work from Juan Lopez Moctezuma, a very talented director who, sadly, died much too young. I could recount the plot (what little there it is), but what really matters here is the originality and effectiveness of the dark, twisted gothic imagery, and the atmosphere of nightmarish unreality. But what really ties it all together is the remarkably committed performance of Tina Romero in the roll of the possessed (read: unleashing her repressed sexuality) Alucarda. She plays her utterly insane part totally straight, helping to keep the film well clear of the campiness it could have otherwise fallen prey to.

ALUCARDA is a dark work of art. One of the best horror films I've ever seen.",1338336000,2,1321,4.7894736842105265
1844801,4,B00008G8SZ,"Justine is thrust in to a depraved world of darkness when she meets the demonically possessed Alucarda, and together, the two set out to defile the church with their unsanctified evil. ALUCARDA serves as a biting critical response to the oppressive Catholic controls that were set on Mexican culture throughout the better half of the twentieth century. The film's arresting visuals, haunting score, and brilliant set pieces are quite unlike anything else in the genre, with each contributing to the surreal mysticism of the plot. Juan Lopez Moctezuma is unafraid to explore a rich and vivid color palette, contrasting hot and cool tones while using the screen as his own morbid canvas. The characters he introduces are equally colorful, depicting a variety of strange, offbeat personas that seem to have stepped out of the pages of some twisted fairy tale. Tina Romero's unnerving performance is wildly over the top, but her crazed shrieks and howls along with her deathly facial gestures will leave viewers believing that she truly is possessed. A culmination of Moctezuma's expressive style explodes on screen in the film's bloody finale, where Alucarda calls upon the powers of Satan to strike down the convent in a rain of fire. ALUCARDA is a compelling visual masterpiece that transforms the screen into a nightmarish vision of hell. It comes as no surprise that Moctezuma was a close colleague of the equally brilliant Alejandro Jodorowsky, director of SANTA SANGRE, let alone an inspiration to other talented Mexican filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro. This possession tale cannot be overlooked, and it still stands as one of the strongest Mexican exports in the genre.

1844803,4,B00008G8SZ,"Demonic possession, south of the border.  That pretty much sums Alucarda up.  Seizing the same
level of unconscionable evil and overwhelming fear that The Exorcist generated, Mexican director Juan Lopez Moctezuma unleashes the gates of Hell upon defenseless viewers in this bloodcurdling cult classic.  This film is wicked.

The movie starts off somewhat incoherent, kinda like a Fulci or Rollins film.  If you prefer everything spelled out for you, like in most American horror flicks, I'd avoid this one.  But for extreme horror fans, this is a must see.

It takes place in a Mexican convent/orphanage.  Young Alucarda and Justine meet there, and become close friends.  To make a long story short, they both become possessed by some demonic entity and terrorize the convent.

Besides the unsettling demonic themes, this film intertwines the extreme violence with a high level of female sexuality and shocking blasphemous imagery.  No crucifix masturbation scenes, but some things close to the same shock level.  It is not meant for the timid viewer.

The climax is jam-packed all sorts of nudity and horrific bedlam.  Very well shot and orchestrated, it will leave a lasting impression.  Truly disturbing.

Overall, Alucarda has been ignored by critics and audiences alike, but is an unheralded gem amongst cult B-movie horror fans.

1844854,4,B00008G8SZ,"Alucarda (Juan Lopez Moctezuma, 1978)

There's something about seventies horror movies that really gets to me. Not in a scary way, mind you, and not (I don't think, anyway) in a nostalgic way. There's much more of a feeling of transgression in a movie like Alucarda than there is in the latest slasher picture in 2008; while there are certainly still guys who are pushing the envelope (in America, anyway; Eli Roth isn't doing anything Hideshi Hino didn't do twenty years before him, but a lot more Americans saw Hostel than will ever see Mermaid in a Manhole), there's a different feel about the seventies horror romps than there are about the new pictures. Perhaps there was more of an immediacy to envelope-pushing back in the seventies? With so much more being socially acceptable nowadays thanks to the wonders of basic cable, you'd think a movie like Alucarda would feel dated in its extremity, almost boring. And yet that's not the case. I grant you, there's very little in here (aside from the full frontal nudity) you wouldn't see on episodes of certain TV dramas these days, but somehow it still comes across as an over-the-top sex-and-violence extravaganza with serious, and rather ugly, undertones.

The story concerns two lovely young ladies, Alucarda (Tina Romero) and Justine (Susanna Kamini), who are growing up in a Catholic orphanage. Alucarda was taken there just after her birth, while Justine has only recently arrived after the death of her parents. Some odd, otherwordly bond connects the two girls, and it is solidified by a band of gypsies they meet on one of their long walks through the woods (and the process of that solidification is one of the scenes in this movie that's going to have you saying ""what the hell was Moctezuma smoking when he made this movie, and where can I get some?""). The process lets the devil out of the young girls and into the convent, in a way, to be fought by the only rational human being left in the movie, Dr. Oszek (Claudio Brook). To say any more about the plot would be to reveal major spoilers for the film, but I can't really describe the enormity of the insanity to be found here without doing so. You'll have to trust me on this-- Alucarda, despite being relatively tame with its sex and gore, goes a lot farther, conceptually, than many more modern films that have trod in its footsteps.

It's tempting, in retrospect, to see this more as a period-piece version of something like The Exorcism of Emily Rose crossed with a good dose of The Devil's Rain; it would certainly convey the atmosphere better (despite the obvious play on words in the title and a number of reviews I've read, the story is far less about vampirism than it is about demonic possession). But the sex and violence angle seems to take a backseat in Moctezuma's film (and Alexis Arroyo's scrrenplay) to the attack on the Church. Granted, Moctezuma softens the blow by having the Church, in this film, be a weird, radical offshoot of Catholicism, but it's still obviously an offshoot of Catholicism (and it's entirely possible Moctezuma simply wanted to portray the whole Catholic church as this particular flavor of crazy; a good deal of Father Lazaro's speech should put the viewer in mind of the Inquisition). Given that, the rather tame nature of the prurient scenes makes sense (they're just seasoning, rather than the main dish), and Alucarda could probably be used as a textbook by more modern directors as to how to integrate such things into their movies, keeping the prurient interest, while still making them at least somewhat integral to the plot; one cannot help but think ""communion"" during the gypsy ritual, for example.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to see this movie, and I cannot but urge the rest of you who haven't seen it to do so at your earliest opportunity. Yeah, it does have its flaws, but they are eclipsed by the many, many strengths here; the script is very good, the set design is fabulous, the costume designer was truly inspired (though by what I've no idea), Moctezuma's direction is at least competent enough to pay tribute to these things, and the special effects are just cheesy enough to come across as charming rather than stupid. But what's really impressive is how all these things fit together to make this film the iconoclast masterpiece it is. ****",1203033600,2,4337,4.763297872340425
1844855,4,B00008G8SZ,"Juan Lopez Moctezuma's horror film Alucarda is mentioned with only moderate frequency as a horror classic, and even then only in the most dedicated circles of horror cinephiles.  There are some films that explore the subject of demonic possession far more convincingly (i.e. the Exorcist) so only those horror fans who can appreciate how a film's style is engineered to unnerve its audience will find Alucarda enjoyable.  Some less enthusiastic audiences will find Alucarda both gratuitous and even annoying.  It's style and atmosphere is unique and clearly the focus of the film.  It is like Dario Argento's Suspiria meets Alejandro Jodorowsky El Topo or the Holy Mountain. Jodorowsky was involved in the production of Alucarda so that influence is no surprise.

The film follows a young girl named Justine as she arrives at a convent after the death of her parents.  She befriends the mysterious Alucarda who may very well be the spawn of the devil.  Basically, what soon follows is a series of horrific events that resemble demonic possession, vampirism, devil worship, and witchcraft.

Alucarda is a very low-budget and modest production.  Nevertheless, it is creepy throughout.  The sound effects in this film are consistently eerie and sometimes create the horror all by itself. The soundtrack is done with a cheap and unique sounding synthesizer which serves to be both creepy and helps distinguish the style of the film even further.  Visually the film is even more bizarre and exceptional. The convent itself looks like a cavern more than an actual building and it is budding with religious imagery that is framed in such a way that we wonder if this is a convent or a witch coven.  The nuns in the convent do resemble nuns, but also do not look particularly dissimilar to undead Egyptian mummies either.  The girls bump into a random traveling gypsy and also a creepy deformed shepherd who unravels the underlying lesbianism between the two girls and then of course leads them into a naked sance or esbat.  There are also some vile moments when the undead emerge screaming, one gets brutally beheaded and another, a girl soaked in blood, violently claws a nun's throat.  The film also has some outstanding sequences with fire.  You actually have to wonder how some people survived stunts on this set when it was completely consumed in flames.

However, don't let most hardcore horror fans fool you; Alucarda is not a shocking exploitation film.  At least it isn't quite as shocking as some people might lead you to believe.  There is a lot full frontal female nudity but it's not nearly as much as I expected and it's never too graphic or directly sexual.  One scene combines the nudity with violence and that can be shocking.  The nude girl rises from a coffin filled with blood and she is covered from head to toe in it.  The film is very violent as well but again it's not anything that pushes the limits and the violence doesn't come at you with as much consistency as you might imagine.  Alucarda can also get somewhat annoying at times with all of the screaming from the girls.  My wife hated the film for that.  I've heard it regarded as the film with the most nudity, violence, and screaming ever...or something like that.  As a combination of those three things it may very well exceed all other films but overall it does not push enough boundaries to be counted as a significant exploitation film.  It is still a great pure horror movie that stands on its own.",1193616000,9,3480,4.814814814814815
1844856,3,B00008G8SZ,"This movie is filled with several memorable scenes and surreal imagery, and I'd recommend it on that fact alone. As a narrative, however, it doesn't quite deliver. There little or no tension, and aside from a single blood-drenched (literally) scene, there's not much of the sense of dread or danger that I want to get from a horror film. That said, it was still enjoyable, yet I would recommend Mondo Macabro's ""Satanico Pandemonium"" over this one if you are looking to spend your coin on some satanic nun action.",1152316800,4,513,4.775280898876405
1844857,4,B00008G8SZ,"Alucarda begins as a new mother in some sort of implied peril, sends her newborn daughter off to a convent for safe keeping. Years later her grown girl (Alucarda) and companion stumble upon mom's tomb and are overtaken by the evil force that killed her. Filled with piss-and-vinegar the two return to the convent and unleash wave of demonic terror that brings the convent to it's knees.

Riding the crest of the Exorcist and Ken Russell's The Devils, Mexican Director, Lopez Moctezuma delivered this hybrid that still manages bare his own unique brand of surrealism. Not unlike Carrie, Alucarda takes the theme of female sexual maturation to it's absurd limits, right down to having the nuns of the convent garbed in what appear to be bloodied menstrual rags. In fact, there is almost a constant ""flow"" of blood & nudity intertwined throughout the film; a flow which the nuns try (and fail) to quell by dishing out equal parts of love & sadism toward the two girls and themselves .

Obviously if your not a fan of  non-linear flights of blasphemous fancy, you need not apply here, because this by no means your run-of-the-mill demonic possession ripoff. Though filled with a good many arresting visuals, I don't agree with those who feel this is Moctezuma's finest hour. I would still give that honor to Mansion of Madness (Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon), largely because in that film Moctezuma orchestrates his delirium with greater virtuosity and focus. I'm guessing it's the ample nudity that gives Alucarda the leg up for some of it's devoted fans.

Mondo Macabro has put out a pretty nice DVD of this bilingual production, with image quality that does justice to Moctezuma's vision. My only beef is that though they include both a Spanish and English audio option, I would have liked to get English subtitles as the Spanish track had additional music cues not present on the English track, and sounded a little more organic in general.",1143331200,29,1937,4.86060606060606

are two good friends who stumble upon some ugly looking man with a special amulet of some sort. amulet. What results is a lot of satanic ritualing and possession in Justine and Alucarda.

1844862,4,B00008G8SZ,"""Alucarda""-- is a demonically silly-ass film that harkens back to the 'Golden Age' of Mexican horror movies (1960's style).
Back in the 60's, Mexicans loved their vampires no matter when or where they came from and this film rips that philosophy off.

One thing I like about (south-of-the-border)surrealist-horror flix-- is that they take no prisioners. Scene after scene in ""Alucarda"" is drenched in violent absurdist art direction and goofy-creepy insane dialogue.
Thank you mondomacabrodvd.com for reissuing this lost classic...

Never scary but always compelling (director) Moctezuma (RIP), lets the story unfold like a cartoonish bad dream.
Much like ""El Topo"" (by Alejandro Jodorowsky, another South American filmakin' mavrick) ""Alucarda""-- is all about atmosphere and an oppressive feeling of dread and destruction.
My Review: Creepy, dumb, captivating and in-yer-face, ""Alucarda""-- remains a lost minor horror masterpiece.",1117065600,4,930,5.881481481481481

This movie was part of an order I put it from a list of lesbian vampire movies. The movie doesn't have a lot of that though.
