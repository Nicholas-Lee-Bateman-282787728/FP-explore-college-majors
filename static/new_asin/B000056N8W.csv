1398579,5,B000056N8W,"I really enjoy Maurice.  I hope he is doing well.  However, he will always be one of the best entertainers.  Watching this live concert reminded me of beautiful it was to be apart of the 70s.",1194307200,,191,4.25
1398580,5,B000056N8W,EWF at their best. To bad they weren't in the US,1181174400,,48,3.4545454545454546
1398581,4,B000056N8W,"For the last two decades Earth, Wind & Fire has continued to tour regularly, though they have not come up with much in the way of memorable fresh material to add to a legacy that provided many timeless performances from roughly 1973-1981.  As such, on this 1994 Japan concert video -- one of Maurice White's last before illness took him off the stage --  all but a couple of tunes are from the above-mentioned era.  However, the performances have too much vitality and freshness for one to think this is just another oldies act going through the motions.  Accordingly, this DVD is a good option for those wanting to get a taste of the group near if not quite at the peak of their performing powers.  By the way, note that there is also a 1990 Live In Japan DVD, just in case anyone is confused about which tour this video represents.

Although I miss the extended jams (e.g., ""Africano"") , EWF does offer strong, concise versions of mostly their greatest hits, covering the seventeen tunes in the DVD's one-hour running time (note that several songs are brief interludes), and performed with a full band including a horn section and two female dancers. The between-song moments are edited down, so you get wall-to-wall music which mostly replicates the sound of the original recordings.  In general both White and particularly Philip Bailey are in top form vocally, and in-step with the choreographed moments.  Still, although his performance doesn't suffer it is a little disconcerting to see White have this ""far-away-look"" in his eyes at times, leaving one to wonder if this is a sign of things to come (to be fair, it may be unrelated).  Nevertheless, I find his presence to be crucial in making this video recommended over any of the post-White EWF DVDs in circulation.",1104624000,36,1774,4.771241830065359
1398582,5,B000056N8W,"I know that some reviews focus on Maurice White's health/illness on this DVD and it almost kept me from buying it.  I'm glad I did purchase it for it is another extraordinary showing by the greatest group of all time.
Sure, some of them are showing their age but we're talking about a band that has been around a LONG time.  And yet they are as tight and competent as ever.  Maurice still makes it look easy and Verdine is almost beyond words for you can hear his masterful bass playing throughout the concert.
The band's energy is a bit different from other concerts but they're one group who even on a bad day (which this concert isn't one) still stand head and shoulders over most groups.",1027641600,6,691,4.425196850393701
1398583,3,B000056N8W,"If you're a true fan of EWF like I've been ever since I first listened to them as a kid in the early 70's, you certainly have to have this bit of memorabilia in your collection.  It's always a plus to actually see them do what they do best... R&B.
Unfortunately, I give this '94 live concert only 3 stars.  Maybe I'm rating this one harder because I'm comparing it to their '90 Live In Japan dvd (which I'd give 5 stars) and their '81 Live in Oakland dvd (4 stars).
Additionally, in this dvd, I felt Maurice was certainly showing how his age/health is starting to get to him.  It's sad to say, but that's the impression I get.  He lacks the energy that the rest of the group is still able to project.
This concert doesn't have the spectacle and glitter that EWF concerts have been know for, but still, it's a good medium to see the music that I grew up with.",982627200,18,858,4.181818181818182

7932367,5,B000056N8W,I really enjoy DVD Earth Wind & Fire they are still going strong 41 years. The best musical band in the world great showmanship. I will see them performed in NYC September 25. The DVD was made in 1994 in Japan it seem like concert was in 2013. This will be part of my music collection for years to come.

7932369,5,B000056N8W,"In recent months I have rediscovered Earth, Wind, and Fire and come to appreciate in a greater way their great music. The DVD is a nice one with songs well-known to many and others more obscure but just as good. The brief interviews are also interesting although not as long as one might wish.",1285545600,,293,4.444444444444445
