8339074,5,B001RXB4EK,DVDs are hard to screw up.  These DVDs take a drab day at work or home and make me crack up.,1304467200,,92,3.380952380952381

8339076,1,B001RXB4EK,"Seriously amazon, this is complete fail.  These are cheaper if bought separately.  Check out the price listings and save yourself some money.",1252540800,3,141,5.363636363636363
8339077,5,B001RXB4EK,"Simply put, I can't keep up with Robot Chicken's free-flowing puns, satire, and squashes. With disc in hand (actually, in the DVD player), I can go over and over again to savor every morsel of RC's genius. I agree that this set of three is overpriced compared with buying them one at a time, and I don't understand why anyone with half a brain would try to get away with this. But Robot Chicken is still one of the funniest, most surreal, squashiest shows ever.",1252540800,,461,4.435294117647059
8339078,1,B001RXB4EK,"Look before you buy this set. I found that if you buy them seperately, you can save at least 50% then to buy them together. I don't understand where people can get off trying to rip customers off.

The 3 seasons set is $79.00

costs of seasons sold seperately:

1st season--$5.89 avg.

2ns season: $12 avg.

3rd season: $12 avg.

6+12+12=$30 avg.
