8300540,1,B001F114I0,"Now, upon scrolling through my movie options in the horror section, I came upon this and its vague description and figured why not.  A HUGE MISTAKE. This film is completely ridiculous with a plot and execution of dialogue that was unbearable. A married couple are held captive in their own home by a sadistic killer and forced to reveal ""secrets"" to each to survive and complete a puzzle of sin. Its an awkward combination of Saw and Captivity but with no gore to hold your attention and the two main characters seemed far to relaxed about having a serial killer watching over them. Even going as far as to pull out a board game to kill some time. WHAT?! Anyway, its a piece of garbage and the twist at the end wasn't even shocking enough to make 5 minutes of this film worth it.  PLEASE, go find something else to watch.",1342051200,7,821,4.430463576158941
8300541,4,B001F114I0,"I do believe this must be watched many times to get the gist of the movie..the same as Memento...

I liked what I watched..but know it will be revealed more as it is watched more and more.",1341705600,,188,4.081081081081081
8300542,1,B001F114I0,"this movie was a confusing piece of crap.  I got the feeling somebody did this for their Master's Thesis in film making and just gave up midway.  If you can figure it out, you're more sophisticated (or nuts) than I am.",1238803200,3,218,4.2926829268292686
