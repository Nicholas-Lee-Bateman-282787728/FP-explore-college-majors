We have watched it many, many times - we all the know tunes they play in the background.  My fave part is when my kids pretend they are farm equipment, like the sprayer that unfolds.  They run around the coffee table along with the video.",1225324800,,348,4.40625
7874903,3,6304551517,"This video failed to hold the attention of my three year old son.  He loves the Citrus Farming and the Apple Farming videos, but this video comes short.  Unlike the other videos, it only shows you the planting and harvesting of the vegetables, but it doesn't show how the vegetables are prepared for market and some are even hard to recognize.  It also has less children in the video and less music, with no uniting theme song.  I strongly recommend that you save your money and buy one of the more recent videos.",1076025600,3,513,4.483870967741935
