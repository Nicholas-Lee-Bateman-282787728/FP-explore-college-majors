801576,3,6304153651,"Well it's been a while since i've seen corey feldman in anything except in the newpaper or on extra promoting his new reality show..oh yes..his forgettable guest appearance on ""Son of a beach"", but his acting in this flick was not half bad and without spoiling anything in the film (you gotta watch it for yourself)he just chose the wrong project but i guess anything that comes his way right now is cool with him (don't quote me on that!) If your in too a b-grade light comedy that won't take away too much time in your life..why not go for it (for corey's sake of course!)
Note: What's up with the $99,00 price tag!!!",1071187200,,619,4.391304347826087
801577,5,6304153651,"Corey Feldman is back in full force in the direct to video triumph of the century. Besides providing a scathing indictment of the american culture of consumerism and unyielding lust for power, this also provides an excellent look at family values and where those time honoured principals fit in today's fast changing world.
Thought provoking.",1030320000,3,342,5.236363636363636

801698,3,6304153651,"If you like to watch beautiful young women, this is an entertaining movie.  Not much plot, though.",1457308800,,98,4.764705882352941
801699,4,6304153651,made me laugh,1456617600,,13,3.6666666666666665
801700,1,6304153651,Not fit for a person to watch,1441065600,,29,3.2857142857142856
801701,2,6304153651,"This forgettable T&A tale reeks of bad 80s syndrome and 'features' Al 'Grandpa' Lewis and one of the Coreys (Feldman) in equally horrible roles. The lead actress gave one of the wimpiest performances ever. The only reason to watch this crud is the abundant nudity, and frankly, that is embarrassing.",1416787200,2,299,5.0
801702,1,6304153651,Poorly written and even poorly acted.,1415491200,,37,5.333333333333333
801703,2,6304153651,Had some funny parts,1409788800,,20,4.25
801704,2,6304153651,"Your typical T&A flick from the 80's! Bad clothes, hair, and acting but some fairly hot chicks.",1409097600,,95,4.647058823529412
801705,1,6304153651,It was a joke how they kept using the exact same cuts for the volleyball sequences.  this movie is low budget and stupid and not worth watching,1404432000,2,143,4.296296296296297
801706,5,6304153651,this was great very sexy dramatic romance with a good dose of good vs. evil. i recommend it for everyone.,1401321600,2,105,4.3
801797,1,6304153651,A sad movie. I am sadder though for myself as I spent my time viewing this stinker. The 'art' on the cover should have been enough to warn of the quality of this movie.,1396396800,,168,3.9705882352941178
801798,3,6304153651,Parts of it were corny & parts are very common in this kind of film. They had the requisite beautiful women in bikini but it also had some interesting parts of the plot.  It was actually better than I expected.,1392768000,,210,4.25
801799,1,6304153651,Just another 80s try at a movie. Cheesy with a side of corn. Poor Corey you have fallen so far.,1387065600,,95,3.8
801800,1,6304153651,There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. Don't waste your time. Learn from my mistake and stay far away.,1380758400,,119,5.0
801801,1,6304153651,I was an extra in this movie when I was just out of High School. I was so excited I was paid to be in a movie. Awesome right?? I never saw the movie make it to a theatre. I had always wondered what happened. Now I know. It was horrible. I was watching to see my 10 seconds of fame and I had to turn it off at least 4 times before I finished it. If you hate Corey Feldman...this is the movie for you.,1377734400,2,399,3.6511627906976742
801802,3,6304153651,"Cory Feldman is not the headliner of this movie, but if you want to see lots of boobs this is the movie for you.",1376179200,3,112,3.7083333333333335
801803,1,6304153651,totally juvenile and stupid.  When will they ever figure out that plastic breasts are unimportant? would not recommend it to anyone.,1371686400,,132,5.285714285714286
801804,3,6304153651,"Sun, beach, babes, buns and boobs, all good.  Not much of a story line but it was nice and easy going, no complaints, about what I expected it to be.",1371427200,,149,3.966666666666667
801805,5,6304153651,I love this movie and it old but still good movie some times we need like this movies good job,1370563200,,94,3.75
801806,5,6304153651,"Boring yet fun to watch? How so? Is the Acting Good?NOPE,Is Al Lewis(Grandpa From the Munsters who Was an Anarchist,Anarchy S U C K S)in the movie any Help? No again,Corey? NO. It is Actually Fort Lauderdale in a Different County(Not Miami) But misleading title aside,why the five stars? Just for the B o o b age of course! This concludes a moronic and sophomoric review for a cheesy movie.",1304985600,8,390,4.585714285714285

7863869,5,6304153651,"Horrible, of course.  But an incredible specimen of sex comedy from the mid-90's that manages to recapture much of the heart of the 80's-based flicks while furthering the style well into the 90's unlike its counterparts which all dropped the ball in the new decade.  A nifty, unique and enjoyable piece of the time period for all its shortcomings.",1486339200,,347,4.864406779661017

7863871,5,6304153651,Great movie if you like beautiful topless females. Also the best car wash scene ever.,1483142400,,85,4.733333333333333
7863872,3,6304153651,This is a 60s California beach movie that follows roughly all the others with lots of young bodies.,1482796800,,99,4.555555555555555
7863873,3,6304153651,Just something to kill time when it is too cold to want to be outside.,1481673600,,70,3.7333333333333334
