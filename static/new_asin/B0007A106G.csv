8046465,5,B0007A106G,"I have only been doing BJJ for 2 months now and have been looking for an instructional DVD to go along with my 4 day/wk training. This DVD has already paid for itself in my opinion and has allowed me to start studying my technique critically. It seems like I am always rushing and not paying enough attention to detail. I am always trying to keep from being submitted, but now the basic techniques are starting to take a solid hold.",1305936000,2,432,4.345679012345679
8046466,5,B0007A106G,"Gustavo Froes is a great instructor, and the dvds are very detailed with the techniques that are shown.  He teaches excellent defensive, and offensive maneuvers from the guard.  This is an excellent way to beef up your BJJ game, and a great way to make sure you are using proper technique.",1243036800,3,289,4.647058823529412
8046467,4,B0007A106G,so far i have watched 3 of the 11 dvds.  gustavo does a good job explaining the moves and the logic behind them.  they also do a good job of showing a move to you from different angles.  gustavo's english is pretty good and the audio/video quality is ok.  i knew absolutely nothing about jiu jitsu so i cant really say what level it is but i have learned a good bit.  i would recommend this to others.,1127692800,6,401,4.089743589743589
8046468,5,B0007A106G,This Brazilian Jiu Jitsu series shocked me. For the price it actually offers much more than stated. I found each DVD to be almost 90 minutes and packed with the most complete techniques and explanations I have ever seen on instructionals and I have many. The Brazilian Master Froes is truly an expert who's teaching is easy to comprehend and follow. The camera work is super and nothing is missed. A fascinating and effective martial art you can learn well from this series and super deal...,1112227200,11,491,4.72093023255814
8046469,5,B0007A106G,"I have not had the chance to view these DVDs yet, but I will go so far as to say that both Master Froes and Master Carvalho are both top-notch instructors of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - and that it would be worth purchasing these instructional videos.  Both instructors have over 20 years each of experience in this martial art, and both have been inducted into the Martial Arts Masters Hall Of Fame for their extensive work with children.  If you're interested in martial arts, mixed martial arts, grappling, self-defense, and/or a great way to get in shape - buy these videos - or if you're ever in Costa Mesa, California, I suggest stopping by Global Jiu Jitsu Academy.  Honest instructors with honest and proven self defense techniques.",1106784000,12,734,4.809523809523809
