8721683,1,B001E75RU6,"I currently teach Physics and purchased this DVD because I thought it may explore some ""cool"" Physics events and topics in the real world. I also thought that it would give more in depth explanations of events using cool graphics and media (for instance 3D representations of wave motion - like something you would find on the Discovery Channel or on the BBC). Instead, what I found were basic 2D graphics, and illustrations which I myself, can create in Flash. Many of my power points had better animations than some of the animations in this DVD (In the DVDs defense, my power points are pretty well done and include advanced animations which I make).

If you are purchasing this DVD because, like me, you were looking for better methods of teaching, examples that would be technologically advanced and explained using excellent multimedia, or examples that would relate real world applications (in video form) - then I advise that you DO NOT buy this DVD.

I found the lessons in this DVD to be short (how much of the topic was covered in depth) and the manner in which it was presented to be short as well (they flew through some topics at a speed that you couldn't even take notes at). In addition, whole DVDs were used, in some cases, for less than 40 min of footage.

With that said, if you want a very easy to understand, EXTREMELY basic, physics lesson on any of the topics covered in this disc, it is a GREAT tool. For my taste, they did not go in enough depth for the DVDs to be used in classrooms, but perhaps, as a small mini lesson for home schooling parents this is great. But for what it is, I found it to be very expensive for what it offers. Much of what it was, you can find, for free, online.

In short, for four hundred dollars, it was not worth it. The video footage was very well done (kudos to the videographer) but the topics were not presented in an interesting manner (it is not done like Bill Nye - it is basically a few young people teaching Physics). I also found the graphics to be primitive by any recent standards (I am surprised to see it was made in 2008 - which was another reason I purchased it... I had faith that it would have been created using the most recent technology). The topics were covered very quickly and most topics were not expanded upon. There were worksheets, activities, and discussions... but not enough to explain the price of the DVD.

Please do not get me wrong. The lessons/ videos are good... the work sheets are great and it is well shot but each of those DVDs in my eyes, were worth 10-20 dollars a piece. NOT 44 dollars a piece (400/9). There is a difference between quality and quality for a certain price. For 400 dollars, do not risk the purchase. You will be as disappointed as I am.

If it goes down in price (to about 100 - 150), then it is worth the buy. Some of the footage is useful (not most) but the worksheets and extras make the DVD worth at least that much.

I am sorry for all the negativity, but I wish more reviewers were up front about this product before I paid 400 dollars for it.",1240272000,11,3064,4.3743409490333915
