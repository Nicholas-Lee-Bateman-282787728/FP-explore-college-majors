The only down side is after the Vai experiance a lot other suff may seem pale.",1193270400,,217,3.8222222222222224
2910431,5,B000TV1STM,"Somewhere out there... Frank is very proud.

This video is amazing (what's more amazing is that orchestras in the US are too snooty to play Steve's music, but...  that's a big topic in itself).

Buy it. Watch it -- repeatedly. You will be glad you did.

Chocked full of Peace, Love, and Good Happiness Stuff.",1190419200,2,308,4.545454545454546
2910432,5,B000TV1STM,"I just got home from seeing Steve Vai in concert at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee.  Great show!!  Great Band.  Just popped in the DVD and let me tell you, if you are a Steve Vai fan...this one's for you.  Great concert with a backing orchestra.  Steve is a perfectionist which make watching him that much more enjoyable.",1190246400,6,321,4.4655172413793105

2910435,5,B000TV1STM,Great mix of Vai material and great content for instrumental orchestra along with Mr. Vai.  I'm a big fan and this is one of his best.  Very innovative!,1380758400,,152,4.392857142857143
2910436,5,B000TV1STM,"Steve Vai is a sensational musician capable to doing things with a guitar that no human has ever done before. Other greats like Frank Zappa and Joe Satriani knew this and were eager to perform alongside him. It was no surprise that Holland's Metropole Orkest, one of the world's premier orchestras, approached Vai to write music for them. Not only did he compose original music for the orchestra, he adapted a collection of his own songs for them to perform with him. This DVD is the complete July 2, 2005 concert with the Metrople Orkest at De Oosterpoort in Holland with a bonus orchestra only performance of ""Bledsoe Blvd"".  Another surprise bonus is a repeat of the concert during which Steve comments on each song and his experiences with the Metropole Orkest players. If you are a fan of Steve Vai and/or The Metropole Orkest, this is a MUST HAVE DVD. The camera work is excellent and it is full of features and surprises.",1377820800,,928,4.658536585365853
2910437,5,B000TV1STM,"I like, Steve Vai. Every time, I hear it, I ask, how It's possible to do this kind of music, and more important play it again, again, and again as the same, with all distortions, and faces he is able to perform. Now with an orchestra, its amazing.",1367798400,,247,4.166666666666667
2910438,5,B000TV1STM,"Steve Vai is one of the greatest guitarists alive today, and this excellent DVD shows that he's not just a (progressive) rocker.

In the first part of this performance, we see that he's able to successfully integrate his signature guitar playing with an orchestra (in Holland, maybe this sort of thing couldn't happen in the US?).

Then in the second part of the performance the orchestra plays one of Steve's commissioned compositions, and I was delighted to find that he's an excellent composer in this setting.  Yes, his signature style is there, but it's not just a rock composition imposed on an orchestra.  Steve clearly understands 'the orchestra as multidimensional instrument' and uses it effectively to create something which sounds fresh and unique.  I also had to laugh at the level of technical challenge the composition surely must have presented for some of the musicians.  :-)

Goes without say that this one is highly recommended.",1358294400,,947,5.070967741935484
2910439,5,B000TV1STM,"This concert is one of the best and most evolved musical pieces I have heard in my life.
Guitar, orchestra, and arrangements are inspiring, innovative, and flawless.
For me this sets a new standard in contemporary music.",1327363200,,220,4.972972972972973
2910440,5,B000TV1STM,"Steve Vai is a monster on the guitar as well as arranging his music for an orchestra!!! This is a great DVD and I have loved and enjoyed watching it over and over again. It is inspiring music and makes me want to learn more on the guitar. I doubt I'll ever achieve the musical genius of Vai, but I can always aspire for it. It's nice to see someone so mature and great on the guitar! You need to buy this DVD, you will NOT be dissapointed!!!",1309046400,,441,4.0227272727272725
2910441,5,B000TV1STM,"My boyfriend LOVES Steve Vai, and even though I'm not exactly a guitar wizard, I watched this with him and it was pretty awesome! Needless to say that this was a VERY satisfying gift. :D",1263772800,2,186,4.3428571428571425
2910442,5,B000TV1STM,"this dvd is an awsome addition to any guitarists concert/rockumentary collection.  via is very impressive and insparational even if you're not a neo-classical player.  you can see a few of the songs on youtube, but it's well worth buying.",1255478400,,238,5.076923076923077
2910443,5,B000TV1STM,"This dvd is absolute magic!  I, being an orchestral player by educated profession (what I went to school for), am always on the lookout for unique and original uses of the traditional classical symphony, and seeing such an awesome group paired with one of the great guitar masters was incredible!

As a violinist, much of my tone is modeled off of Steve Vai.  In fact, my mentor, a well-known electric violinist who has built a line of instruments with the range of a guitar, has many Vai-like qualities to his style, and likewise with Vai - in fact, they know each other and have worked together!  So before I even know who SV was, I was totally into his sounds via electric violin, and when I finally saw him live for the first time, I couldn't believe he had a voice other than his guitar, because it's like an extension of his own being!

Highly recommended to watch, especially on a big flatscreen tv with surround sound :)",1244419200,3,928,4.5
2910444,5,B000TV1STM,"I think any fan of Steve Vai should see this. This shows the scope of the man that I knew was always there and was hoping to one day see. He plays his instrument with all the precision of a concert violinist. Its wonderful to see the man in this element. I hope this is the beginning of more things to come. He even says ""by hook or by crook"", and I believe him. Get this for the aspiring guitarist at your house. They will get from it another direction than just the usual media fodder.",1230854400,3,487,4.083333333333333
2910445,3,B000TV1STM,"Steve is one of the most creative and gifted rock guitar players of this time but you have to recognize when a project doesn't fit your style and type of music. Perhaps Steve's intention was the same that took Inwie to start a project with a Japanese symphonic orchestra (that, by the way, does a great job) for his Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra. Well, that was a good fit for Malmsteen, but for Vai, in my opinion, didn't work. The orchestration of a song written originally for a rock band is not an easy task. There is a balance between the soloist and the supporting instruments in turn that has to be worked to get a harmonic result. Even with the virtuosity of Vai, the mix sounds poor, sometimes empty, and the climax of some songs sound like they didn't spend enough time rehearsing, working on a more refined orchestration, or all of the above. To see Vai in action is always a treat and doesn't hurt to pay for this DVD, but my expectations were higher of what I saw and listened.",1228953600,7,1009,4.43010752688172
2910446,4,B000TV1STM,"Wow. This is what Hendrix maybe would have sounded if he was alive today.
Went out and brought Guitar Hero III so that I can play like Steve!
Great guitar playing with a awesome orchestra.",1202256000,,188,4.4
2910447,5,B000TV1STM,"Mr. Vai never ceases to amaze me... not only is this one of the best Orchestral/Rock performances I've seen to date, but, it is also great to see Steve do some of his old songs as well. Steve is truely a master of his craft. I highly recommend this DVD.",1200787200,,253,4.08
2910448,5,B000TV1STM,"If you are a fan of Vai and have access to a home theater with 5.1 surround there is no excuse not to own this DVD.  The sound was mixed very well. I'm not going to go on and on about how amazing the music is and how great a composer and player Steve is, if you're already a fan you should know this already.  Even if you don't have a home theater or have all these songs, its worth the meager price to hear symphonic versions of the classics.  Buy it!",1200614400,,452,3.891304347826087
2910449,4,B000TV1STM,Steve Vai's work inspirates me always. DVD came all the way to Finland quickly and in good condition.,1198713600,,101,4.666666666666667
2910450,3,B000TV1STM,"Im going to be fairly brief with this review. I've only watched the DVD once so this is my initial impressions on the DVD. Not the best Vai DVD I've ever purchased. And in all honesty I think the problem is inherently related to the fact that Vai has an orchestra backing up his incredible guitar playing. In my opinion this is the tragedy of the DVD. It has no chance to succeed. The orchestra seems to steal Vais Thunder. Not with talent that surpasses his by any stretch of the imagination but simply because they are louder than his guitar. Another thing thats missing on this DVD is the interaction between Vai and his ""original band"" members. The chemistry between Vai and his bass player Billy Sheenan on previous DVDs makes them so worth watching. This one has none of that. Its like Vai is all by himself even though he has a huge orchestra backing him up. If you want some of Vais  better DVDs Id have to recommend ""Live in Astoria"" and ""G3 - Live in Tokyo"". Only get this one if you just have to see everything Vai has done or you have money to burn and don't mind blowing some cash on this project. My recommendation to everyone else? Pass.",1196640000,3,1152,4.358139534883721
2910451,5,B000TV1STM,"Steve Vai is a great guitar player, as Frank Zappa recognized, but this concert shows Steve's talent is more than just a player. The orchestra is wonderful to watch by itself. I wish we could have more music like this live in the US. If you appreciate good music you need to see this DVD.

I think what it does show is how much the Orkest really enjoyed themselves in the creation of this project, you can often see them with great big grins on their faces and really getting into the whole vibe of it. Steve turns in some amazing performances and it's really great to hear his music played in a different style. Get it now !!",1194652800,,600,5.908045977011494
