3434959,5,B0019DKLHY,This story is an excellent history of a country and the working out of a political idea. It also shows the beauty of this small country. There is also a presentation of the problems they face as a society after linking to world society. All in all very educating and hopeful.,1327795200,,275,4.411764705882353
3434960,5,B0019DKLHY,"""The documentary taught me about the importance of happiness in one's life. It used Bhutan as an example of how to achieve that happiness. Everyone has different definitions of happiness, and for Bhutanese it is peace, security, and contentment. The Bhutanese people value the spiritual qualities of the mind above all else. They only require the basic education, health, housing, and food; nothing beyond that. If asked what would make them happier, they seek for more free time to spend with their family and friends. No government can provide internal happiness but they can provide the environment to develop that happiness. The Bhutanese have set out to achieve this through the philosophy of Gross National Happiness. The moral I found in this film is that things inside are more valuable then things on the outside. More is not necessarily better; being satisfied with what you already have is better.""

""Today is a great day. Although Bhutan is a poor country they have great happiness. Today I was again reminded of how important human life is. We are very lucky. Even though in Bhutan, the education, economy, and number of citizens is low, they have great happiness. They care for each other very well. His Majesty Jigme is a very special person; he sits on the floor with his people as one of them. I have never seen a king do that. The country that has a good and honorable king is a country with happiness. This is a wonderful point of Bhutan. Today I saw men and women say that money, good looks, and material wealth is of little value, happiness is what we really need.""

""I was very impressed with the movie today. In my opinion, the meaning of the film, among the many that can be found therein, was to have the effort and contentment in things that one already has. Then the highest happiness, that which sustains itself from within, can be found.
I was reminded that, whatever it is we do in life, we must have true happiness""

""Today was a memorable day. I got to know Bhutan. Even though this country is small and poor it has happiness. What about us as a whole? This country really touches my heart. Everyone cares for one another. The people of Bhutan have happiness but not from the 5 senses, from their own heart. One day I hope that I will meet with a happiness like this. The country has Buddhism, the teachings of the Lord Buddha and Sangha, so the people can easily know what to do with their life and how to bring peace and happiness into it. I hope that in the future, no matter if people are poor, have Mercedes Benz, have a big house, nice wife and family, or etc. that everyone can bring happiness into their lives through meditation and through the teachings of Lord Buddha.""

""Today I learn about Bhutan's ""GNH"" program and how it is helping to preserve the nation's environment and culture while moving forward economically in the 21st century. Bhutan is a very beautiful country that is slowly opening up to the world in order to preserve their traditions. I like the smiles on the people's faces. It is interesting to see how articulate the people are in English. The people clearly see the negative dangers that television, the internet, and Western advertising bring to their traditional Buddhist society""

""Today I learned about a country that is very content and never unhappy in trying to preserve their culture and nature and trying to develop the country. Even the farmers are so happy because one of their priorities is that they do not want to destroy nature. They just want good health and good education. They want to keep the society growing along with the economy. I can feel that His Majesty the King is very kind and a great example. He takes care of all of his people so well, like a father and he knows that happiness is through inner peace. I believe that he can take care of them every time and for good things.""

3434961,5,B0019DKLHY,"This film offers an interesting look at a people confronting and balancing the forces of modernization and economic development with spirituality and a desire to preserve traditional culture.  The subject matter aligns with this larger modern search for happiness and fulfillment in an increasingly material and impersonal world.  In addition, this philosophy of ""Gross National Happiness"" falls in line with the very real global need to adjust behavior and mindset to account for responsible environmental practices and to live more in harmony with nature.",1223164800,10,557,5.619047619047619

If you ever wonder how countries should move in the path of development and real progress without all the side effects which the human race is facing in this ""modern civilization"", you must watch this film.",1385251200,,252,5.023809523809524
8273641,5,B0019DKLHY,"Few Americans know much about Bhutan, and few have considered the disadvantages of assessing a nation's development in terms of Gross National Product, as we do in the United States.  The enlightened monarchy of Bhutan has guided that nation toward happiness as the measure of success.  This is a wonderful film with beautiful photography and background music.  It uses footage and interviews with ordinary people and experts, including the nations' official leaders, to makes its points.  It is successful in helping the viewer understand a Buddhist country with a different world view--and getting the viewer question his/her own assumptions about happiness being linked to material possessions.  Highly recommended.",1382832000,,718,5.611111111111111
8273642,4,B0019DKLHY,"Good overview of a country that until very recently was isolated from the ""modern"" world. Being one of the last countries to welcome TV  (and subsequent advertisement), Bhutan's population is slowly showing changes in its values. One value that particularly spoke to me was beauty -- and woman beauty.  Before advertisement, a ""nice"" woman was the mother figure: a strong lady, who took care of children and worked in the fields (Bhutan is the least urbanized country in the world; its economy is agriculture-based). Today, after the introduction of advertisement, a beautiful woman is the usual tall, skinny and... well, you know the rest. Make-up is slowly entering Bhutan, and there are strong forces resisting such external influences, but the conflict between tradition and modernization is unevitable and strong. Bhutan needs some modernization, but to which point is technology bringing more good that bad? Where are the boundaries, if there are any? It is an intersting and powerful phenomenon to watch. I wonder how Bhutn will be in 20 years and recommend this documentary.

If you are interested in Bhutan, I also highly recommend this wonderful read:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Sky-and-the-Earth-A-Journey-into-Bhutan/dp/157322815X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey into Bhutan</a>",1369785600,,1384,5.944723618090452
8273643,4,B0019DKLHY,"I got the see the last part of this on PBS, and wanted to see the first part of the show. It's really very good, and gives one a better perspective on life in places other than the majority Christian U.S.. I have always had a problem with the ""It's my God Given Right to destroy Nature"", and it's good to see a culture that has a differ point of view, and a different approach to dealing with modern problems..

8273644,4,B0019DKLHY,"""Gross National Happiness"" increasingly grows familiar as a catchphrase to sum up Bhutan's ambitions to orient its Himalayan fastness within harmonious precepts as taught by Buddhism and shared equitably among its peoples to assure mutual comfort, educational advancement, and spiritual progress. This project comprises this one-hour video produced by Thomas Vendetti and John Wehrheim. With Dr. Vendetti's experience with mental health outreach for the Hopi and now the residents of Maui, and Mr. Wehrheim's career as a hydroponics engineer who has worked in Hawai'i and Bhutan, one understands their professional connections that linked them to explore this kingdom's initiative under its benign monarchy to promote entry into the modern world while keeping traditional lifestyles, and as they are perched between a covetous China and a teeming India.

This geographical situation demands caution. Its ecological treasures require caretaking. Compared to the recent fate of other Buddhist realms, Tibet, Ladakh, Mustang, and Bhutan's neighbor, Sikkim, the need to preserve ancient wisdom, careful tourism, and economic growth makes this land a unique case study, the last jurisdiction where Tantric Buddhism enters into the governance of the nation.

Part 1 introduces the environmental imperative, and then segues into culture, water, and governance. The feel is very much what you'd see on public television or as an educational film. That is, there's no dramatization or re-enactments, no need to pump up an inherently worthy subject. The Prime Minister, Lyinpo Yeshey Zimba, and a musician-Performing Arts director, Jigme Drukpa, take turns narrating their country's plans. The Dalai Lama's prescriptions for happiness append this as a short feature. All agree: the pleasures of this world can be beneficial, but their best attainment is by that which limits greed and sustains nature.

I watched this prefaced by a bit of familiarity from books. (See my reviews of ""Radio Shangri-La"" by Lisa Napoli, ""So Close to Heaven"" by Barbara Crossette, Bradley Mayhew's Lonely Planet and Francoise Pommaret's Bhutan guidebooks.) But like most Westerners, I lacked direct sight of this place. Color within native costumes, the architecture sustained in the old style for all new buildings, and the soft scenes of mist and scree all unfurled. Robert C. Stone's cinematography conveys some of the vastness of high peaks and narrow valleys, ravines and rivers cutting into sheer stone.

Out of this landscape, after learning of John Wehrheim's expertise (besides the script, he's written and photographed well his 1991-2006 stints there in ""Bhutan: Hidden Lands of Happiness""--some of its evocative black-and-white images enrich the film; see my review), I can better relate to why hydro-electric energy takes up part 3 of the running time. Its facilities largely out of sight underground and in narrow gorges, they now harness but 5% of the potential power. More than the zero of a few years ago, but far more could be used to sell off to India, neatly capturing the snowmelt and profiting the inhabitants of a land needing revenue with so little arable land in such a vertically dominant spot.

My wife wondered as she watched if there was more to Bhutan's story; she hinted it seemed too simple. Hints of tension arise elsewhere; part 2 mentions that the advent of television in 1999 sparked a rise in crime and strife, so this piqued my curiosity. It's natural not to want to highlight this in a film about the pursuit of happiness, but more might have been given to the problems that modernity brings, as well as the trap that Bhutan may feel as it's aiming for freedom while positioned between two superpowers bent on making this century their own in a globalized, more heartless, system.

The 2008 film ends in an open-ended manner. The four parts or ""pillars"" of the Happiness plan along the Middle Path of moderation preached by the Buddha organize it, and after each, some music is shown. Western musicians join in as a celebration for the King's birthday occurs, and this concludes the documentary. I was not sure why the film wrapped itself up when it did, but this may suggest the striving of the kingdom will always be softened by the chance for festivity and community, aspects again necessary along with electrification, healthcare, literacy, and education (delightful that birth control is often taught to villagers by monks--a great touch!) as must-haves on the four-part plan.",1351036800,3,4488,5.243732590529248
8273645,5,B0019DKLHY,"I wasn't sure when I ordered this one whether it was indeed the same film I had seen on PBS locally, and was delighted to discover that it is the same film. How can I express the beauty of a wordview coming through the shadows of today's world like invisible light? By which I mean, the context created in this film (only an hour, I think) by people who are aware of the West, but have looked deeply into what it means to have good government This context is so far from the kind of accepted aggression and conflict that is standard fare for more ""modern"" countries I think it should be seen, if only to demonstrate what a country can do and be for its people.",1344556800,2,660,4.2047244094488185
