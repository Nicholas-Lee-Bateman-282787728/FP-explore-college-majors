7670749,5,B01BX2B9VW,"This DVD  is just as funny as I had expected.  However, I do have my favorite episodes on each of the two discs.  I love the Second Stag Night of Doggy Wilkinson, What Happened to the Horse and In which Howard gets Double Booked most of all on Disc #1. The ole buddies celebrate with an older (80 years) buddy who is getting married within hours. Many hilarious moments occur. What happened to the House is runny as the old buddies ""create"" mischief which caused a panic that involved two not-so-brave police officers. Howard gets double booked when his comrades have compassion for Marina.  My favorite episodes on Disc #2 are: The Crowcroft Challenges,(Alvin, Howard and Marina dresses as crows in a challenge that causes surprises and funny moments).  Howard Remembers Where He Left His Bike Pump (Howard is confronted with an old female acquaintance that he had kept a secret); and Sinclair And The Wormley Witches gets funnier as it nears the end. Sinclair thinks the Wormley Witches had cast a spell on him. After the old buddies tried to convince him otherwise, the sight of Pearl,(in a bad mood)  convinces Sinclair that there are witches in the area.",1508889600,,1159,4.77
7670750,5,B01BX2B9VW,"Love this series, it's lighthearted, silly but so enjoyable and the scenery is absolutely beautiful....... wonderful cast of male and female actors , each one unique.
