3482095,4,B001B43IVC,"This is a multi-level crime thriller starring Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War). Someone's bumping off cell-phone users and blowing up cell-phone towers, and even when you see who's doing it, you still don't know who's doing it. I'm an ardent Michael Kitchen fan, and I enjoyed this lengthy, 2 disk, 3 hr., 43 min. British drama.",1304985600,,325,4.927272727272728
3482096,5,B001B43IVC,"I've enjoyed Michael Kitchen's work as an easy-going gent as in Out of Africa, Enchanted April, and the terrific series Foyle's War. So, it was a surprise to see him venture into a role that was so
different from his other works...a vengeful(not that he didn't have good reason)man.",1254009600,2,282,4.775510204081633
3482097,4,B001B43IVC,"This glossy, engaging miniseries is a succession of interconnected revenge stories within the mobile phone industry.  The pacing is swift, the look is smart and current and the production values are high.  Most important, the show features the wonderful Michael Kitchen, who appears in (and dominates) the final two episodes.  Each of the four episodes is approximately 50 minutes in length--perfect for home viewing--but be warned, once you start you won't want to stop.  The story is told from multiple perspectives, as if it were a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces being fitted in different ways.  Each time that parts of the story are retold we learn more about the actual events and the motivations behind them.  This is very nice work, with superb performances, a slick script and a nice blend of background music, noise, titles, quick cuts between scenes--the whole magilla.  This is not the Britain that you see depicted in the posters on the travel agents' walls.  This is high stakes industrial Britain, where the champagne flows, major-league scores are settled and blood is spilled in serious quantities.  Go for it.",1244678400,,1125,5.070652173913044
3482098,4,B001B43IVC,"There are 4 episodes which, at first, do not seem to be tied together. However, the plot goes back and forth and motives of the characters get more sinister with each scene. The final episode does tie all together. Michael Kitchen does not play a very nice person and if you have seen him in Foyle's War it is difficult to imagine him taking this role and playing it so well.",1238716800,10,375,4.295774647887324
3482099,3,B001B43IVC,Mobile was OK. There were enough twists in the plot to keep us watching to the end. It's definitely better than most US-made films of this type. We'll watch this again.,1238371200,,168,4.451612903225806
3482100,5,B001B43IVC,"This UK telemovie in four parts was in fact their version of a miniseries
that U.S. stations often play in two hour blocks over two nights.  In this case we get a fantastic story of revenge and a monstrous criminal plot that involves cell phones or mobiles as they are called in the UK.
It does have some nudity which UK television is more advanced than the US in showing.  Europeon television producers are just not as prudish as American ones and that's our loss I think.  However violence and death are part of most mystery movies. And that great subgenre from italy the giallo does that the best.  And this does feature lots of violence and you should expect this even in a sherlock holmes mystery as murder is murder! This show features a intertwining story with a twist ending that I didn't see coming and I watch endless mysteries and giallos! The acting is first class from everyone involved. This show isn't for small kids but then murder mysteries are by nature more adult.  If you want a solid story  of evil revenge and greed then this one will be hard to stop watching!",1234915200,3,1082,4.494897959183674
3482101,1,B001B43IVC,You enjoyed 'Foyle's War' and now you see Michael Kitchen on the cover? Don't make my mistake - I bought the DVD an I tried to watch it - I really tried.,1229385600,2,153,3.8125
3482102,2,B001B43IVC,"I only watched the first five minutes before I turned this off. The violence was pretty graphic and there was a nude sex scene right at the beginning of the film (male rear visible).  I suspect this would easily qualify for ""R"" rating if it was rated.",1228694400,3,251,4.340425531914893
3482103,4,B001B43IVC,"The acting is first-rate, the plot is satisfyingly complex if you don't mind several reversals snatched from the air, production values excellent.  But the viewer has to be willing to suspend disbelief pretty darn high, like accepting that hypnosis can alter daily behavior, and a killer who, quite randomly, kills or does not kill with no discernible reason.  By the end I found myself calling out the plot changes.  Still, pretty entertaining if you don't demand too much.",1225411200,5,474,5.051282051282051
3482104,5,B001B43IVC,"WOW!  Spellbinding.  A contemporary mystery and British drama that will NOT allow you to stop between the four episodes.  The plot is murder based on revenge revolving around MOBILE phone use.  The story bounces around in time as fast as cell phone calls, but never gets you lost, except for ""who dun it?"", or ""who is doing what next?""  The cast of characters involved in the whole story are so intertwined and separate events so interwoven that it is hard to find distinction between the victims and the villains.  Who is the bad guy, anyhow?

There is included the shootings, bombings, a child seduction, blackmail, murders, suicide, bad cops-good cops, hit and run death, conspiracy, revenge, war, corrupt business, betrayal, snipers, theft, sabotage, and Beelzebub all connected with text-messaging.  What's not to like?

It is the masterful criss-crossing of the plot(s), written by British TV writer, John Fay, that makes this what surely will become a Classic mystery of the century.  It may leave you looking over your shoulder the next time your cell phone rings.  There's no end to the action and intrigue.

Acorn Media gets a huge prize for adding the subtitle option.  Jamie Draven (playing ex-soldier, officer Stoan) & Michael Kitchen, ( Telecom exec, David West) should also be given high performance awards.  206 minutes that guarantee you can't figure it out till the story decides to reveal the ending.

And the greatest mystery: the credits include as ""Assistant Script Editor"" the name of Catherine Cookson, a prolific British author of great fame.  She died June 11, 1998, several years prior to the creation of ""MOBILE"" (2007).",1220572800,24,1648,5.048148148148148
3482115,5,B001B43IVC,"I liked it...acting and actors great. Story less original, but I loved its passion...AND THE ENDING! ",1520380800,,101,5.3125
3482116,3,B001B43IVC,"A fun watch -- a bit long at times.  Lead actor's too-long hair a distraction - far too long for a soldier.  Mixed acting - some good, some not so good.",1519084800,,152,3.870967741935484
3482117,3,B001B43IVC,"I love Michael Kitchens, but this is the most disjointed series I've ever watched, actually couldn't finish watching the 3rd episode. I actually repeated a couple of episodes to try to collect my senses thinking it was my fault, but no, just poor management.....It was all down to bad script and bad direction. Phew! It could've been awfully good, but lost something somewhere along the line. Perhaps it was all in the flashbacks which didn't make sense and didn't connect, sorry Michael, doesn't deserve 3 stars, shame on you!",1518134400,,527,4.932584269662922
3482118,5,B001B43IVC,Michael Kitchen is a great actor.,1517443200,,33,4.666666666666667
3482119,5,B001B43IVC,Better than expected. Creative story line.,1483574400,,42,6.166666666666667
3482120,3,B001B43IVC,Just a so-so mystery in three parts. Actors come and go and tend not to appear in all sections.,1483574400,,95,4.052631578947368
3482121,3,B001B43IVC,"This is the worst BBC production/series I have ever seen and I have watched most of them. It's very violent and the acting is worse than a subpar American movie except for disc 3 (the only part Kitchen plays in btw) - he does a fabulous job as a man seeking revenge. Other reviews say he's ""bad"" - bad my butt - he righteously seeks justice but not ""by the books"" as Foyle would do. It's perfectly understandable to me.",1480982400,2,419,4.25
3482122,5,B001B43IVC,I love anything with Michael Kitchen. But this is a great show. Suspenseful and gripping.  Recommend highly.,1478908800,,108,5.352941176470588
3482123,5,B001B43IVC,How could  you not like a movie that Micheal Kitchen is in.,1446422400,2,59,3.9166666666666665
3482124,3,B001B43IVC,"Disappointed in this movie.  It just was not up to Michael Kitchen standards and in one chapter, he has no part. I grade the movie about a two.
Sorta silly ending.",1432684800,2,163,4.258064516129032
3482135,5,B001B43IVC,intricate plot. Great actors,1431820800,,28,6.25
3482136,4,B001B43IVC,"It's difficult to identify and describe why this 2007 offering from ITV misses the mark.  Each of the four episodes is only about :50 minutes long which doesn't allow enough background development; and yet time is given over to other, less relevant parts.  I almost gave up after the first instalment.  Throughout, some of the acting is quite bad - the crying wife in part one is especially irritating.  By the third show when Michael Kitchen and Samantha Bond appear, the plots finally start to come together.  Jamie Draven is excellent.  The overall ending is surprising and satisfying but the final scene disappoints. All said, the rather farfetched premise could have been better presented but this series is still far better than most of what's shown on TV.",1430092800,4,762,4.9140625
3482137,1,B001B43IVC,Enjoyed the first episode - but really - to force us to sit there and watch three more scenarios - the point being?  Writers ran out of ideas?  Watched two episodes; once was enough.  Should have quit while they were ahead.,1429833600,,223,4.390243902439025
3482138,5,B001B43IVC,"Interesting throughout, this British offering holds the viewer in suspense. The ending is well done. Give it a try!",1418860800,,115,5.105263157894737

3482141,5,B001B43IVC,I like to watch british movie series and this was on my bucket list.  This movie is worth watching and the ending surprised me.,1389571200,,127,4.291666666666667
3482142,5,B001B43IVC,Good BBC movie mystery. If you like Michael Kitchen you will like this movie. Highly recommend this to anyone. thanks,1384732800,,117,4.9
3482143,5,B001B43IVC,Michael Kitchen as always gives a wonderful performance.  He makes a story line that's out of the ordinary actually believable.,1364774400,,127,5.35

8281834,3,B001B43IVC,"I used to the think British drama--even the cops 'n robbers stuff--was more sophisticated than the junk we get here. But Mobile is the biggest bloodbath I've seen since the nausea-inducing Happy Valley.

Mobile gets off to a good start.  Someone is executing BMW drivers who use their phones while driving.  But before long, innocent people are getting hurt and/or killed.  It turns out, the story is actually about revenge and it's not told in linear fashion.  Instead, each episode fills in a few more details about the same events.  It's clever and confusing.

You can see why actors enjoy playing bad guys and they're obviously having a terrific time with this tale of revenge in which everybody gets to be a bad guy.  Well played and written but ultimately as empty as the characters.  And oh so bloody.  It's not clear to me why this level of talent is devoted to what is basically a Charles Bronson movie.",1525651200,,912,4.679245283018868
8281835,4,B001B43IVC,"I don't recommend this for the faint of heart.  Excellent acting by all involved, and it had a very intriguing plot; however that being said it showed the most corrupt, vile side of nature of almost everyone involved. Terribly depressing series full of hate, greed, and despair.  I wish I had not watched this.  There was nothing redeeming in the four episodes.  It is a vengeance movie without satisfaction. I normally like vengeance movies, but there has to be a modicum of decency in someone and there really was none.  I gave it four stars because it was well done.",1525132800,,569,4.65
8281836,1,B001B43IVC,It is pure unadulterated trash!!!!!!!!!!,1524009600,,40,7.2

8281838,5,B001B43IVC,Excellent. Hope there's a season 2.,1523750400,,35,5.0
8281839,2,B001B43IVC,"The mobile-brain cancer connection is tenuous at best; but, even suspending disbelief, this show is just awkwardly constructed with weak dialogue.  Couldn't get into it at all.",1523750400,,176,5.518518518518518
8281840,5,B001B43IVC,"I thought this was a great series.  Enjoyed the characters, acting, scenery and plot.  And the ending was quite a twist that I definitely didn't see coming!",1523059200,,156,4.7407407407407405
8281841,2,B001B43IVC,"I was really taken by the first episode. It seemed a truly original take on the usual Brit procedural show.  Even though I too was disappointed because the great Michael Kitchen didn't appear until later, I hung in there wincing thru bad dialogue, hyperactive active acting and plot holes you could drive a police van through.  The writers seemed so proud of their through line, they ignored more obvious silliness: hysterical, screaming coppers, stolen police car, trying to make a stairway date at a crime scene, dumb police station antics, etc. It was the constant inattention to the little things that kept a great plot from ever jelling.  Id love to see this re-written and re-shot with a new cast... but keep Kitchen!",1521676800,,723,4.861788617886178
8281842,5,B001B43IVC,Nice thriller and interesting how each of the episodes fills in different aspects and characters. A little hard to follow at times but fast paced and intriguing anyway.,1521417600,,168,5.035714285714286
8281843,4,B001B43IVC,"I give four instead of five stars only because the protagonist's fate is left annoyingly unresolved. Otherwise, an excellent series.",1521331200,,132,5.65
