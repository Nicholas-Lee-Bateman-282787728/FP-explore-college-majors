8379240,3,B002SAMMGU,"I wanted to give this movie chetiri stars, but... I just couldn't, so gave it three (pun). I'll say upfront that if you have no interest in Russia, don't bother with this movie. It has some intriguing elements, some disgusting ones, and some that are truly bizarre. It is representative of a genre of films which I would put under the rubric, ""Russia Was a Really Depressing Place in the 1990s."" I think I found more meaning in it than other Western viewers might since my formative experience in Russia was a summer I spent there in 1999, at the height of the economic crisis. The long lines of old women at metro stations selling belongings made quite an impression.

I've now, appropriately enough, watched the move four times - I watch Russian movies for language practice, not entertainment - and understood more each time. I watched it with subtitles the fourth time before writing this review. What is below is with the most minimum of spoilers. If anyone Russian can make any more sense of it, please leave a comment explaining it further.

The focus of the movie is clearly Marina (real name Marina Vovchenko), the natural focus of attraction at the bar discussion which sets the stage early in the movie. Does she represent Russia? She is beautiful, she works as a prostitute (a reference to the resource dependence?), she has suffered immensely in life, she claims to be something she isn't to outsiders. She has more dialogue than all the other characters put together. Is there any further meaning? If so, I'm not sure. The ending is anti-climatic to say the least.

The other two characters, Oleg and Vladimir, are not well developed. Does Oleg represent an upper class estranged from regular society? Does Vladimir represent the artistic class which has been kidnapped and forced to serve the state?

All the attempts at symbolism may be pointless; there are so many crazy aspects to the movie, that the producer, Ilya Khrzhanovsky, may just be crazy. About 40 minutes in this two-hour film could have been cut without losing much, and with some gain. The bizarre schemes with the old crones getting drunk and acting weird I could have done without.

If you want to watch one film in this genre, maybe watch this one, maybe watch ""Brother."" Avoid ""Cargo 200,"" which is probably the most sadistic movie I've ever seen. ""4"" at least has its redemptive moments.",1349568000,2,2373,4.778048780487805
8379241,5,B002SAMMGU,"To all the reviewers who criticize and hate this film: u have no clue about Russia and its people. Probably u have no clue even about Slav central European countries, those in the EU, nevermind Russia. Broaden your horizons. The film is an excellent, visually striking, provocative, non-commercial and brave allegory of modern Russia and Russian soul.",1273190400,2,351,5.175438596491228
8379242,3,B002SAMMGU,"It's a mysterious film: set up nicely by a conversation that becomes increasingly intoxicated. Vodka plays an important role here. Lots of 4s. Are we led to believe that the four sisters are clones? Clones of the elderly women? (Woman at the end?) Is the falsely accused (or seemingly so) paying in ignorance for his clone's crimes? Meat also plays an important role as a symbol of our barbarity. Perhaps. There are long scenes of endless walking with a single camera bouncing along. Nuclear facilities in the distance. Just a montage of neo-industrial wasteland, flesh, lies, alcohol: a stew of organic unities: which do not always inspire pride. Some things exist for a while, have four legs, crawl around on the planet for a time, and pass. No point, or at least no tidy storytime point. Just a chemical process. I suppose this is existential scientism with a dash of theater, canned meat. It serves as a film but might not be the delicacy you were hoping for. Filmspam. Cinespam. (The casual lecture on the history of human cloning, true or not, is interesting, without a doubt.)",1249344000,,1083,4.7967914438502675
8379243,4,B002SAMMGU,"A strange story of swearing, sober, money-thirsty new Russia where actions missed for viewers following a poor translation into classic English.

Provides interesting info on a real level of Soviet science and engineering industrializing the cloning of humans decades ago.",1240617600,,272,5.8
8379244,5,B002SAMMGU,"4 starts out with some prologues where we are shown what the three protagonists do for a living. Volodya is is a piano tuner, Marina is a prostitute, and Oleg sells meat. The three meet by chance in a bar where the bartender keeps falling asleep, and make up elaborate lies about their professions. Marina claims to work in advertising. Oleg claims to deliver bottled water to Putin. Volodya concocts a wild sci-fi story about genetic engineering and claims that thousands of Russians are human clones, and that they have been cloning humans for decades. When they clone four at a time, the ""doubles"" have the best survival rate.
Volodya later is discussing identity with an old man in front of four aquariums. The man claims he has no identity, that no human does, but that a turtle will always be a turtle. Volodya is more optimistic than the man, and says that humans can choose what they want to be.

Later, Oleg is greeted at home by an old man who might be his father and who is germ-obsessed. He takes off Oleg's shoes for him and puts them in plastic bags, and refuses to cook normal steak, he will only steam meat. He compulsively washes and cleans everything in the house, which drives Oleg to distraction.

Most of the film, however, is dedicated to Marina's journey back to the remote Russian village she grew up in. Certain scenes are repeated with slight variations in the lies she's telling, and we're not quite sure if she's fantasizing or revising her memories or what. The camera work changes from stable and steady in the city environments to shaky and blurred in the countryside. There are a lot of closeups on hands. When she arrives, we see that she is there for her sister's funeral. There were four sisters. Everyone in the village makes dolls. The faces were masks made of chewed bread, and the sister died choking on the bread.
I could spend all day trying to deconstruct the symbolism here, but I think the comparisons to Inland Empire are not totally irrational.

Granted, the subject matter is entirely different. There is discussion of the number 4 not being sacred in any society, and it's visually used as a motif in many of the scenes and mirrors the themes presented in the bar scene of identity crises, replication and anonymity. There are four unnaturally round pigs in the restaurant, four sisters, four dogs, four aquariums. Marat ""saves"" four dolls, only to have them eaten and destroyed by the dogs. Later, he makes four masks of his own face before hanging himself. The soundscape is very well done, and it's really what holds the movie together a lot of the time. It's a bleak and difficult film to watch.",1194739200,9,2647,4.651709401709402
8379245,1,B002SAMMGU,"I regret giving this film one star.  Amazon should make zero stars an option.

This is a pretentious Russian ""art film"" in the Tarkovsky tradition.  Not much of a plot.  Mostly just images on a screen.  I watched all of it only to see if anything makes sense at the end.  It doesn't.

If you enjoy watching silent, ten-minute scenes of a woman walking through a construction site or garbage dump, this film is for you.  If not, do yourself a favor and pass it up.

There are plenty of good Russian movies.  This is not one of them.",1185062400,3,531,4.2727272727272725
8379246,2,B002SAMMGU,"What seemed to be a potential powerful art film, especiially the opening street dogs scene, turns horribly in to a rambling incoherent repetitive one dimensional boring movie. Shamelessly copy idea from Peter Greenaway were blatantly put into effect through out the film. Wasted 2Hrs I'll never get back.",1178323200,2,304,5.354166666666667
8379247,2,B002SAMMGU,"The Russian movie, ""4,"" follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar.  One is a musician, one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl.

""4,"" I gather, is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are), but the movie is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it.  There seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy Russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could figure out what anybody`s really up to here.

Despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes, ""4"" is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.",1172448000,,983,4.6976744186046515
