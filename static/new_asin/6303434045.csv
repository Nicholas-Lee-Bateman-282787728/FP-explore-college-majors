The music to Chaconne goes hand in hand with the dancing and stays in your head weeks after hearing it. I never really liked the Greek myths so Prodigal Son wasn't extremely memorable for me. Of course Barishnikov shined in the part with his amazing leaps, but overall,I didn't enjoy the Prodigal Son as much as I did Chaconne. It didn't captivate me with the dancing or the music. Even some of the good parts seemed boring to me.",1005955200,4,535,4.583333333333333
7846771,3,6303434045,"Without a doubt ""Prodigal Son"" is an amazing piece of choreography. Unfortunately, it's not captured here. Karin Von Arnoldingen seems unsure of herself and wobbles frequently. Still, some of it's  brilliance peeps through and one can get an IDEA of how great this ballet  must have been when performed by Edward Villella and Diane Adams. Since  there is no video of that- I'll take it! Even not too good is better than  not at all.",953337600,10,432,4.72
