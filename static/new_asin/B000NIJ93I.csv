8177966,4,B000NIJ93I,"I enjoyed this belly dance practice dvd.  I love the tribal style but not the wacky fusion style.  The fusion style belly dance dvds do have some fabulous dancers but I prefer dances that at least appear to be ethnic and not that weird gothic style.  This tribal cardio dvd had different sections, one for learning the steps, then a section to dance along with instructional cues and then two performances.  I haven't practiced belly dance for a few years and wanted to get back into it but am now out of shape.  This dvd was easy to keep up with at a moderate pace but did get the heart rate up.

8177967,5,B000NIJ93I,Great DVD.  Her movements are phenominal.  They are so fluid and snake like. This DVD will definitely help you tone your arms and improve your dance moves.  (It doesn't help that I'm a silver jewelry addict and her jewelry is fantastic.),1204675200,,237,4.7317073170731705
8177968,5,B000NIJ93I,"I realy like this dvd,for me it is the grounding of my routines. I love it,its soothing yet energising at the same time.
the steps are easy to follow,if you are a beginner the steps are broken down for you.
you can do the whole routine,or you can take a step sequence one at a time.
the steps are named after dancers that have been members of this troupe before.
I definatlety recommend it.",1186963200,,390,4.283783783783784
8177969,3,B000NIJ93I,"I wish it had been made clear in the description that this is some sort of tribal fusion, not ATS! (It's not the ""Rachel Brice"" style of fusion either, just to be clear.)  Apparently it is a fusion style which is unique to this troupe.

I bought this because I thought it sounded like a good way to practice my tribal moves while getting a light workout, but there are very few moves on here that I recognize from my ATS class.  Many of the moves actually seem based on Egyptian-style.

The music is kind of boring.  There is a voice-over track during the workout giving instruction on the moves, but in some sections it is barely audible.

There is a section which instructs on how to put the moves together, although there is no breakdown of how to actually do each move.  On the upside, during the workout the moves in each section are repeated over and over so it is pretty easy to catch on if you are at all familiar with the basics of Egyptian-style.

Like other reviewers have noted, this seems like a halfway decent cardio workout for someone who is not very fit, which is what I was looking for.

I was not impressed by the performances of the troupe.  They don't seem to move very well together, and the moves were overly simple and repetitive.  It was kind of like watching them go through the workout in costume rather than a real performance. I would have preferred to see them really show their stuff!  The individual performances of four of the dancers were somewhat better, a little more energetic and showy.

One thing I did enjoy is the costuming in the performance section.  Not too glittery, not too earthy, a little different from the everyday tribal uniform while still keeping a similar feel.  I may just borrow a few costuming ideas from this DVD.",1179100800,16,1771,4.490625
8177970,1,B000NIJ93I,"Only buy this DVD if you have no access to real Tribal belly dance teachers or if you live someplace where finding physical fitness and/or Tribal bellydance classes do not exist.

This is an OK DVD for women who have no outlet to exercise. The cover art is great, the name of the DVD is interesting, but the quality does not hold up to the promise. For couch potatoes only!",1177718400,11,373,4.328571428571428
8177971,3,B000NIJ93I,"I've been doing the twins (Neena and Veena) belly dance workout for beginners for the past 2 months. I've enjoyed it, but I needed more of a challenge and an aerobic workout. This tape just didn't do it for me. I didn't even break a sweat. The production value isn't great and the workout didn't seem like much of a workout to me.

The instructors are full-figured goddess types. They are great examples of how you can exercise and be healthy at any size. For that, I applaud them.

So if you want a low impact, low intensity woman-centered workout, this is for you.",1176249600,15,566,4.4326923076923075
8177972,4,B000NIJ93I,"I just finished working out/watching this dvd for the first time.  First impression - it was fun.  This is not meant as an instructional dvd - it does not tell you how to do basic moves such as a camel, hip bump or snake arms, you are expected to already know them.  This is a workout.  The basic moves are put together in several nice combinations and then the combinations are combined into a workout.  One of the things I appreciated about the dvd is that Robin mentions the cues used to signal changes in the movement -  very helpful for dancers who want to incorporate these combinations into improv performances.  It also is a help since the music has a tendency to compete with Robin's voice and I found myself watching for cues once I knew what I was looking for.  I will definitely be using this dvd - especially on nights when I don't feel like a power workout, but will feel guilty if I don't get off the couch.  It only got a four star rating because I felt the instructional section was weak - the combos could have been broken down a bit better.",1174780800,11,1059,4.308080808080808
8177973,5,B000NIJ93I,"Produced by Robin Denise Johnson, Cardio Tribal Belly Dance mixes it up with a Tribal soundtrack that gets you in the mood to dance. The instructional part was fun and easy to follow. The workout was superb. I loved every minute of it from the warm up to the choreographed dance at the end. In my opinion the music out did that of any other. I usually find workout music boring but this music was something I want to listen to when I'm in the car. Robin Denise Johnson does a great job of introducing tribal belly dance in a fashion that is entertaining and fun.",1171584000,9,562,4.311320754716981
