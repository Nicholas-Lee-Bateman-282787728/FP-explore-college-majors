1741534,3,B00006BSDJ,The first two tapes of the epic were great but the later part of the story told on the third tape didn't seem to fit with the first two.  I felt as if i watched two different movies.  Overall I enjoyed the film but think that a more fitting actress should have could have been chosen to play the role of the Mary Ellen in her later years!,1074211200,25,338,3.9558823529411766
7966956,3,B00006BSDJ,"Recorded this off the TV in two halves and we found the first riveting. We could not wait to see the second but thought I had recorded the wrong program. Why change the actors, they looked nothing like each other, it spoilt it for us and because of that the story line did not continue and we got bored. Now wish that we had never seen the second half.",1470009600,,352,4.115942028985507
7966957,3,B00006BSDJ,After 4 lovely episodes for some stupid reason they changed actors for the last 2 episodes. Instead of aging the actors (25 years later) they have all new ones. HUGE mistake.,1420243200,,174,4.645161290322581

I would order this for a gift for my mother!",1373241600,,124,4.125
7966961,2,B00006BSDJ,"This tv series was a epic fail and a waste of my time. The 2nd part is like a totally different story. Everything was off and nothing ran smoothly. Warning, don't waste your money or time on this.",1325808000,,196,4.184210526315789
7966962,4,B00006BSDJ,"Great story, unyielding plot, dramatic ending...everything that makes a good movie series. This made me want to read the book! Draws you in and keeps you interested.",1322784000,,165,5.148148148148148
7966963,3,B00006BSDJ,"I really liked the first part of A DINNER OF HERBS. So, wasted no time purchasing both parts.

Shock! It is the same story like but the characters look and act so differently that I could not get back into the story line.

I gave it three stars because the first part is really good.",1319846400,3,283,4.127272727272727
7966964,3,B00006BSDJ,"Dinner of Herbs is the story of  a group of childhood friends Roddy, Hal and Mary Ellen. They become friends after Roddy's dad is mysteriously killed. As they grow older, friendship turns to love and Mary Ellen falls hard for Roddy. She seduces him and becomes pregnant leading her to lose her job and to be scorned by the villagers.

I found the first dvd interesting. The second dvd, the last 2 episodes they changed actors and actresses and fast-forwarded 20 years to when Mary Ellen and Roddy's girl Kate is older. Different actors and actresses and kind of silly plot device involving Kate's two fiancee's rather bored me. Kate seemed to be overly favored by her parents and I felt a bit sorry for the other children. The actor who played her second fiancee wasn't a good fit. He had zero emotional range and I expected him to be a villain. He hardly ever smiles and seems very dour. The fight scene between him and Kate's dad was terrible.

This was worth a view, especially for the first 4 episodes but the last 2 were not my favorite.",1222905600,8,1042,4.502645502645502
7966965,5,B00006BSDJ,"I have enjoyed all of Ms. Cookson's novels-to-movies.  This one was no exception.  A sweeping saga covering 25 years with stories of greed, love, lust and murder.  A great cast and believable storyline makes this movie a must-see for Cookson fans.",1208131200,8,247,4.975609756097561
