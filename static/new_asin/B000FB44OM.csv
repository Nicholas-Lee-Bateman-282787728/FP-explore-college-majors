8119853,4,B000FB44OM,"Considering the time constraints, most probably, the individual works here were intended for one-hour television shows (at 50 minutes and 45 minutes, respectively). This is too bad since one is left wanting to hear more music, at least the complete songs. In fact, this is the greatest weakness of these works: Too many destinations with few and difficult arrivals.

On the other hand, one of the greatest benefits of these films, being turned on location, is that the viewer learns about the musicians, their music and instruments, in situ, where the instruments and music have been made for centuries; very nice and suggestive symbiosis made into an anthropologic jurney into the Romanian folk music indeed.

The good: veritable shows of folk creativity; superb music--jazz improvisation fans be on notice; very good illustration of the symbiosis between nature and music making.
The not so good: the poor sound (the price for filming on location); voiceover instead of subtitles; average image quality/transfer; incomplete musical pieces. On a different note, Margineanu could have done without the non-musical introduction to the series, which is extremely interesting, yet without relation to folk music and musical instruments, the theme of the films otherwise.

In conclusion, do not look here for a complete experience, just an authentic one.",1148083200,,1350,5.388625592417061
