1822425,5,B00007L5UY,"September Sessions... really really sick. Besides the fact that the waves are insanely good and the music is super mellow, Kelly and Rob do an awesome job speaking and describing what it feels like to surf. I consider this the holy grail to surfing. If you haven't surfed before though, the message may pass you by. Every surfer should have a copy of this.",1042502400,11,356,4.578125
1822426,5,B00007L5UY,"This is a great surfing movie for those who enjoy watching the world's best surfers on the worlds sweetest waves without the pounding punk music that accompanies most surf movies.  It was filmed during one surf trip to Indo with Dorian, Slater, Machado and others.  The waves are perfect and the soundtrack is a great mix of laid back Jack Johnson style music that matches the surfing well.  This is my favorite surf movie with the possible exception of the Endless Summer's and I highly recommend it.",1040947200,10,501,4.735632183908046
1822447,4,B00007L5UY,Great action shots! It's fun to see these world class pro's surfing for fun. Only gave it 4 because its too short!,1375142400,,114,4.2272727272727275
1822448,5,B00007L5UY,This video had nice music tracks that accompanied the surfing well. It was different from many of the videos I've seen on Surfing and I would definitely recommend it.,1363651200,,166,4.758620689655173
1822449,5,B00007L5UY,"The September Sessions by Jack Johnson is the best surf video I have ever come by. Its so relaxing and showcases some of the best surfers in the world just enjoying themselves. I would recommend everyone in the world watching this at least once a week for stress relief. Only sad thing is, its too short. Clocking in under an hour for the main edit is a bummer. But, the extras help extend that a lot. Overall, amazing product. Its a shame there arnt more like this one. Jack needs to get back into doing surf videos.",1287014400,,517,4.34020618556701
1822450,1,B00007L5UY,This should be a DVD bonus feature to Thicker Than Water or something.  $15 for 26 min?  Seriously?,1252800000,2,99,4.444444444444445
1822451,5,B00007L5UY,What a good music. The surf is good and the music makes the movie really interesting even if it is too short.,1227744000,,109,4.0
1822452,5,B00007L5UY,"I recently bought 10 surfing videos to get through my 8 months in Iowa before I can go back to Mazatlan. I think I did well on some of them in no small part to Surfer Magazine's list and Amazon reviews. My favorites are September Sessions and Thicker Than Water; a tossup, really. Buy them both and save the shipping. I've about decided that any film involving Jack Johnson and/or the Malloys is a no-brainer; get it. What you have is some of the best surfers in the world on a Menatwais boat trip, free from the pressures of contests, getting some of the best waves in the world and YOU, are invited along. These are guys who seem to get along well having a whole lot of fun. Brad Gerlach is a stitch - just non-stop funny and yeah, he surf for good brah. You can see a younger version of Kelly Slater and Shane Dorian with hair, Slater spitting some water out at the camera looking like a young Marlon Brandon and, of course, surfing insanely well; Dorian snapping his backside hacks with a robot-like precision; Rob Machado just so fluid and stylish, seemingly able to turn on the afterburner whenever he wants some more speed. But, hey, I'm not trying to critique the surfers it's just that you can't help but get into it. A massive plus for me is the extremely well-chosen music. I've become a fan of Jack Johnson's music as well as his cinematography. He's difficult to categorize but I think of what Michael Franks might have done if he'd been surfing in Hawai'i instead of chilling out in Rio back in the day. Another thing I like is the bonus commentary from Kelly, Jack, Brad, and Rob. I could watch this for days. As an added feel-good, the filmmakers are donating all proceeds from the sale of the film to SurfAid, a truly worthwhile organization helping the residents of Sumatra and the Mentawais with medical aid.",1216252800,3,1827,4.48948948948949

It has more of a vacation feel to it. Same good music. I would recommend his first video over this one, unless you are into the filming 16 Mil thing.",1205193600,,307,4.4035087719298245
1822455,5,B00007L5UY,"This surf flick is nothing like ""Hit & Run"" or ""Loose Change""! While the two previously mentioned are of the amp-you-up,@#**$-to-the-wall variety. September Sessions is more laid back and soulful in its presentation,  in both audio and video. Kelly narrates the whole thing. Reminds me of my best sessions out with the boys catchin as many waves as you want til your arms turn to jello. This is surfing the way it's meant to be. Save the aggro for your crowded beach break when the girls are watching. We need a sequel!",1195862400,,519,4.641304347826087
1822456,5,B00007L5UY,"Too good to be so short. When September Sessions reaches the end we feel that we are missing a lot of this film. High perfomance, relaxed pure surfing. The real spirit of surfing, no dollar paved waves. Refreshing body surfing footage. Even the bonus tracks deserve a look.",1179360000,,273,4.708333333333333
1822477,5,B00007L5UY,Jack Johnson did a great movie with awesome music! I love to put this in and just relax and hangout!,1178496000,,100,4.05
1822478,4,B00007L5UY,"This is an excellent surf flick.  My only knock about it is the fact that it's way too short of a film.  That being said, the film couldn't have been any better.  Machado has always been one of my favorite surfers and the guy just tears it up, while making it all look so effortless.  As any surfer will tell you - it isn't as easy as these guys make it look.  I also liked the fact that this film was really about soul surfing.  There were no contests and none of the big wave riding that sometimes can be labeled as a different sport all together.

Everytime I watch this film I can't help but want to take all of my suits and ties out of the closet and drop them off at the local Good Will store.  Then I would call my boss and tell him that I am done with the corporate world and off I will go to find my soul again.  There is no sport in the world quite like surfing.  I know, because I have pretty much played them all and nothing next to sex can even compare to catching that perfect wave.  It is truly the greatest sport and the greatest feeling in the world.

Great job by Kelly Slater (the Michael Jordan of surfing) who produced this wonderful video.  The stars in the film - Slater, Gerlach, Machado, etc... all of course rip it up, each in their own unique, smooth, artistic style.  Musician and fellow surfer Jack Johnson created a great film that all surfers should enjoy (even soul papa long boarders) because of the beautiful scenery, footage, and of course Johnson's own soulful, serene music to boot.  Like I stated earlier, the only thing that is a bit disappointing is the fact that this film is too damn short and it leaves you aching for more.  That is the only reason I give it four stars instead of five.  Other than that, you won't be disappointed.",1176595200,,1774,4.232142857142857
1822479,5,B00007L5UY,"This movie isn't based around competitions, tow-in, or any real agressive surfing at all.  It's just a group of close friends (copetitors in the past) that embark on a voyage to be one with the ocean.  The waves aren't neccessarily the biggest, and the moves aren't neccessrily the most trend setting, but overall this is one of the best surfing movies I have ever watched.  Great soundtrack and great surfing.  Two thumbs up!",1170720000,,426,4.794520547945205
1822480,3,B00007L5UY,"I'll start by saying that if you like a laid back-style surf movie, you'll probably enjoy this.  I just felt like the filming wasn't very dynamic.  It shows the same sort of shots over and over again and it didn't really give a sense of ""being there.""  It's a good movie, but I think others like Odyssey, Step into Liquid and Black and White are better.",1169078400,3,353,4.318181818181818
1822481,3,B00007L5UY,"What do you get when you have five of the best surfers on the planet, nearly perfect conditions in paradise and a soundtrack from one of the biggest musicians this decade? Thirty minutes of footage. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS VIDEO. It's a tease; it simply wets your appetite for more. However, if you can pick it up used or deeply discounted snatch it up - you won't be sorry.",1142380800,12,381,4.305555555555555
1822482,3,B00007L5UY,"I expected to this to be a little longer.  Not sure how long it is, but it isn't that long.  It is a bunch of high profile pros surfing the Mentawais.

I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.  It is a pretty good video and has a good sound track.  But it lacks diversity in surf spots and seems too short.  The bonus features aren't that great either.

If you are obsessed with watching big-name pros surf I would get it.",1137369600,4,419,3.9759036144578315
1822483,5,B00007L5UY,Sweet shots sweet music by Jack J and his crew. Faces tell stories. I'm not a real surfer but it doesn't matter cause the 16mm film used and the pictures it produced tells a story about something even greater than Surfboarding. If your into things that are great i guess.,1127433600,3,271,4.44
1822484,3,B00007L5UY,"This is a more raw piece of film making than some others, but it brings you right into their world; you're on the beach, out in the rollers, and dropping in with these guys.  It's good stuff weather you surf or not.",1123804800,4,215,4.119047619047619
1822485,5,B00007L5UY,"September sessions is fantastic because it isn't about some competition or has any lame footage of time in between surfs- it's just about the surfing.... it may be short but it's all quality, beautiful surfing.... and it has an absolutely amazing soundtrack.",1103068800,25,258,5.166666666666667
1822486,5,B00007L5UY,"...which is a historic session in the Mentawais featuring some of the world's best surfers - Slater, Machado, Dorian et al - and some great grooves from Greyboy, Jack, G Love and more.
No it's not long - but I've probably spent hours watching this footage over and over.  It's a cut above the typical ""extreme sports"" crap that dubs a second rate speed metal soundtrack over a choppy edit of some mediocre cutbacks.  Instead you get beautiful 16mm footage following these guys right down the barrel and a soundtrack that is as fluid and smooth as the waves.
The disc has some bonus stuff including commentaries, bonus footage and a ""Making of"" that aired on television.  It easily extends the content to at least an hour or more.  The commentaries are actually worth a listen and you may actually learn a thing or two from some of these guys.  No it's not a plot-driven pop piece like Blue Crush and it's not the Bruce/Dana Brown zeitgeist stuff.  It's great music, great waves, and great surfers doing their thing...",1087862400,34,1017,4.653631284916201

1822498,2,B00007L5UY,If you are looking for a great surfing video this one is not what you are looking for. Nice waves and rides but nothing special. One or two good Pipeline or Makaha waves are much more better. I would not recommend it!,1072742400,2,217,4.190476190476191
1822499,3,B00007L5UY,"I thought this was excellent for what it was. The surfing and filming was top notch. All aspects this was done very well FOR A VERY SHORT FILM.I would not call this a movie. I would call it a great short documentary that leaves you wanting more. Especially because it was done so well I wanted ALOT MORE. The picture quality and sound is fine. The only disapointment I have with this dvd is that it was not worth the price for what length (less than 30mins.) you get. For the same price as any other dvd out there you get ALOT less film and time spent watching. Fans of Jack Johnson will no doubt have to have this on dvd but the result (for me anyways) left me wanting to see ALOT more, and I especially wanted more for the ""regular price"" I paid to see this dvd. Even thought the quality of filming of this short documentary was spectacular, atleast with the Brown productions, Mav Surfer, and Laird White Knuckle productions you get more lenghty films and bang (more surfing) for you buck in my opinion.",1070496000,32,1006,4.3563829787234045
1822500,5,B00007L5UY,"I've watched many surf films, but this is my all-time favorite.  No other film catches surfing's essence so beautifully and effectively: the communion with nature, the incredible good fortune of finding the perfect wave, and the beauty of making complex moves look simple and fluid.  Slater is in his element, and Jack Johnson's soundtrack (both original and selections from others) combine in a synergy that manages to communicate more than a sport, but a whole ""pura vida"" way of looking at the world.  It's a movie you turn on at the end of the day, beer (or margarita for beach goers) in hand, sun setting out the window, and take in the goodness of life.
Or maybe it's just me that appreciates that sort of thing...",1070323200,12,720,4.698412698412699
1822501,5,B00007L5UY,"September Sessions. An amazing movie with only the best surf footage ever released onto a 16mm film. Jack Johnson not only a gifted surfer, and singer/songwriter, but also a movie genius. The visual aspect of this movie is great, the surf adventure is amzaing, and it even has an awesome soundtrack to back it up. Rad job Jack I give it 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!",1067385600,3,362,4.584615384615384
1822502,5,B00007L5UY,"Yeah, I know I'm behind the times, and yeah, I haven't seen a 'real' surf movie in a while (Blue Crush doesn't count) but I just had to write this review for this outstanding Jack Johnson flick. Everyone knows the Johnson story so I won't repeat the unnecessary.
This movie was absolutely amazing and perhaps the best surf movie I've ever seen. The soundtrack is mix of laid back soulful grooves, the surfing is flawless, the dialogue is true, and [most importantly] the cinematography is sublime. Slater's surfing is in another dimension and the contortionistic curves that he pulls off are unbelievable. Several of his tube rides were perhaps some of the longest I've seen. I loved how he was trying so many different stances and methods to surfing the waves - he had the place completely wired and is toying with these Mentawai Island waves at several points during the movie. When Slater is an old man people will look back at this video for proof that he was the best surfer in the modern era and realize how much his surfing alone progressed the entire sport. Rob Machado's graceful and fluid lines, and honest comments about life on the ASP (Association of Surfing Professionals) Pro Tour made me view him in a completely different light. I have a newfound respect for this guy. And then there is Luke Egan and the comment about him surfing with 90s style back in the 80s was dead-on; the guy was so ahead of his time when he first came on the International scene.
I only wish the movie was a little longer than 28 minutes but the bonus coverage kinda made up for it. This is a must have for any surfer. Dialogue commentary from Jack Johnson and Kelly Slater are a nice plus as well as 'The Making of September Sessions'. I liked the movie so much that I picked up the soundtrack as well. Feel the stoke and pick it up today.",1061164800,14,1832,4.504504504504505
1822503,5,B00007L5UY,"As an (ex-)surfer who has been landlocked for the past 12 years I look for my beach fix anywhere I can get it.  This movie is sweet, the waves are PERFECT, and the music is not bad.  It is what it says it is - SURFING - no story, no plot, just pure, clean fun.  The movie is short (about 30 minutes), but also has additional ""rights"" and ""lefts"" footage in the bonus materials.  I work long hours and I'm usually asleep before I can finish a long movie.  This is just long enough to take my mind off the day and still have a few minutes to see my wife before I pass out.  Highly recommended.",1059004800,3,591,4.0085470085470085
1822504,5,B00007L5UY,"September Sessions is a great film produced by Jack Johnson and Kelly Slater about their surfing trip to Sumatra. If you like the way Jack plays his music then you should enjoy this dvd. It displays surfing in a very artistic way with great tunes and a mellow feel. I snowboard and wakeboard however I'm not a huge surfer and I found this movie to be awesome. It's great for putting on and just chilling to, wishing you could escape to a tropical paradise and surf. The soundtrack is great too. Pick this one up if you want a kik back relaxing video made by a great songwriter/film maker. Can't go wrong with this one.",1054944000,9,618,4.3826086956521735
