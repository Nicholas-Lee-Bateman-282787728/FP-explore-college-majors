3443943,3,B0019UGYD2,"Donovan has said he had a hard time working on this film, he had little interaction with the director, etc. It was his only major starring role in a film (he had previously appeared in a cameo role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/If-It-s-Tuesday-This-Must-Be-Belgium/dp/B0014BJ1AO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium</a>
In response to it not being a musical or a children's film, it was originally intended as a children's film (according to Maltin) and Donovan did write five or so songs and had he written seven  it would have been a musical. He does a beautiful rendition of ""Sailing Homeward"" (here retitled ""Riding Homeward"" written a year earlier for his Open Road documentary) It is a crime that Donovan didn't release a soundtrack for this nor Brother Sun Sister Moon released two years later. Not a bad film, although I brought it just to see Donovan.",1288742400,7,936,5.5
3443944,5,B0019UGYD2,"Really, this movie was a lot better than I expected it to be. Granted, it is very sad, and it could be downright depressing if you aren't a Jack Wild fan. But the quality was good, nice colors. The sound quality was almost as good, but not quite. Although this movie is rated G, there are a few things that couldn've gotten it PG, such as a man and woman hugging suggestively, a man being burned at the stake, a few swear words, etc. Nothing major.
But if you're a Jack Wild fan, Or a Donovan fan, GET THIS FILM! You won't regret it.",1276732800,2,533,4.134615384615385
3443945,5,B0019UGYD2,"I read the fairy tales of the Grimm brothers but not this one, so I didn't wait for a special touch.
But I was a fan of Donovan thinking of his music and his image appropriate of this character, really in tune of ""the pied piper"".
Example; ""For little ones"" from ""A gift from a flower to the garden""
Main character but not really in the foreground that is suitable for a novice in motion picture.
He is quite good.
Jacques Demy and his musicals and ""Peau d'ane"" put the story in a simple way as it has to be: the poor and the rich, the innocence and the evil ones, two parts among this black plague and the rats.
After the healing of the village by the pied piper, the leaders don't want to pay, magician lead away the children.
And marks of plague appear again on the face of the burgomaster.
And at the end the hesitation of the one-legged child is easily allegoric.
Simple and enlightening as an excellent fairy tale.",1272844800,2,920,4.293103448275862
3443946,4,B0019UGYD2,"Not what you'd expect, this movie comes off as something between ""The Seventh Seal"" and ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"".  And that's a good thing!  Perhaps the strangest 'children's movie', with a grim and cold style, moments of horror, a distant and creepy Donovan floating through the movie not being the nicest singer in the world, not to mention the dirt, filth and grime.  Add the Plague,  a child bride, and one of the good guys getting burned at the stake - not to mention a very ambiguous ending - and it would be a rare child indeed who wouldn't be traumatized by this film.

However, if you've ever read 'The Brother's Grim', you might recognize the authenticity.  This ain't no Disney version!  There are some great actors involved, especially Donald Pleasant and Michael Hordern.  Even Donovan has the right 'vibe' for the story.  The whole thing has an early 70's feel, where anything can happen, and to some degree it does.

This is much better than ""The Model Shop"".  I suspect the director was more comfortable in medieval Germany than in hip Los Angeles.  Add great costumes, good songs, and excellent acting, and you get a pretty unique experience.  If you are up for something a little different - something that certainly could never be made today, with no happy ending - this movie could be very entertaining and memorable",1271548800,14,1343,4.737068965517241
3443947,3,B0019UGYD2,"It was very hard to get a hold of a copy of this DVD, but - at least for me - it was worth the wait.

I saw it when initially released in my country (around 1973) and even then it was at an art-house. Never had an opportunity to watch it again until now, but there were some plot points that made the flick eminently rewatchable.

The story is very well known, but the setting is superb. The petty selfishness of the various characters in Hamelin are precisely depicted: the greedy, the corrupt, the vicious.

Some of the cast is awfully miscast: Donovan makes no difference whether he is or not on screen (I would preferred Cat Stevens in his place, for one) and Jack Wild could be anyone else for that matter, such is the dilettantism of his acting.

But apart from them you find a superbly wicked Donald Pleasence, a most naughty John Hurt and some others, which will make you enjoy this film. Obviously, to fully enjoy it you must keep in mind that is a ""period"" film; no only in the time setting of the plot but in the time of his making.",1265155200,,1043,4.252525252525253
3443948,3,B0019UGYD2,"Jacques Demy's The Pied Piper is neither musical (though there are three songs) nor children's film, more an almost resigned fable about the foibles of human nature. The Piper isn't even the main character. Rather it's an ensemble piece, with the town of Hamelin, with all its pettiness and everyday corruptions, that takes centerstage. It's the kind of film that could only have been made in the 70s, set in a vividly realised medieval world that at times threatens to make Monty Python and the Holy Grail look glamorised, though it doesn't revel in the filth or the grotesque. Aside from the travelling players, almost everyone is out for whatever they can get - even Donovan's piper, for all his hippie folkie songs (and there are only three of them) wants a thousand gilders for a spot of pest control he knows won't prevent the plague from coming to Hamelin, while Donald Pleasance's baron won't pay up because he's bankrupting himself buying his way out of Hell by building a cathedral for the Church. The Church would much rather he provided them with troops for another civil war (""The Pope wants a new emperor because the emperor wants a new Pope.""). Even the nominal love interest is far from a Disney princess, but the Burgomaster's bored young daughter bartered to the baron's callous son (John Hurt) for political power by her father (Roy Kinnear) and for a bit of adultery with the husband-to-be by her mother (Diana Dors). It's not so much a portrait of superstition versus reason as one of superstition versus superstition with the hint of the seed of reason that may take generations to flower: as Michael Hordern's Jewish alchemist tells his inquisitors, where once he had hoped the world would learn from his discoveries, now he can only hope the world learns from their mistakes.

The film isn't entirely successful by any means, but it's constantly fascinating and even manages not to seem as clumsy as most Euro-puddings - in this case an English picture (one of David Puttnam and Sandy Lieberson's first) directed by a Frenchman and shot in Bavaria on some excellent locations - probably because it keeps the cast almost entirely British so there's no jarring clash of accents. Donovan's not exactly a great actor but he's mostly harmless as the Piper (although his wardrobe isn't terribly pied), though he's infinitely less hopeless than Patsy Puttnam in a thankfully brief role as the player's wife. Jack Wild shows his limitations as the most famous cripple in fairy tales, Richard Eyre has a nice turn as an increasingly disillusioned pilgrim, Peter Vaughn brings the church into disrepute as a pragmatic Bishop and it's strangely appropriate to see John Hurt playing Pleasance's son considering the way his career has evolved into a modern-day Pleasance's as a stock feature in undemanding low-budget movies.

Long out of circulation, Legend's extras-free Region 1 NTSC DVD isn't a great transfer but it's acceptable enough considering the film's rarity and Paramount's disinterest in releasing it themselves. In France the film is available in an English-friendly 10-disc boxed set of Demy's features. Very unusual and worth a look.",1247443200,6,3161,4.996204933586338
3443949,2,B0019UGYD2,"This one did not age well. It's very poorly paced and so predictable it's difficult to watch. For collectors only, or people who want to see what you could get away with filming back in the day.",1244332800,2,194,4.27027027027027
3443950,5,B0019UGYD2,"First, I would like to say that this movie has a rating of G and this movie may be a bit off-putting for younger children (there is a scene where rats have eaten the faces off some people in a cottage and a burning - not graphic - at the stake).

But the important thing about this movie, is that is really a great retelling of The Pied Piper.  Although, the acting is surprisingly stiff considering the calibur of actors, the scenes are realistic for the times.  Filmed in Germany, itself, the countryside is gorgeous.  The costumes are really funny, especially the hats!!

Donovan does two really pretty songs, but this is not a musical by any means.  He plays a small role, even though he is the Pied Piper (and he plays a real guitar instead of lute).  Jack Wild does the best acting job (a very underrated actor).  He plays the crippled boy who is
left behind.  *SPOILER ALERT* But unlike the written version, where the boy is crying ""wait for me!"", Jack's character is on the verge of becoming a man and realizes that he has a new life ahead of him and accepts being left behind.

 *SPOILER ALERT*  Unless you know the real story, it is not really clear why the Piper takes all the children and it ends without the adults realizing the children are even gone.

This is a more adult-centered version of 'The Pied Piper', and the story and the color are well worth the price, even if only for the historical value of a young Donovan, the late Jack Wild and a celebration of the 70s!

Trivia Note:  One of the children is played by Julian Leitch.  He is the son of Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones.  Although Dono and Linda had been living together and Julian felt Dono really was his father, Linda did not consent to marrying Dono until directly after Brian's death.",1215993600,17,1771,4.416666666666667
3443951,5,B0019UGYD2,"As I was born in Hamelin and grew up with the pipers tale, I love this film. It shows a time more than 700 years ago, very interesting:
And a good Artist and musican in the part of DONOVAN ""Pied Piper"". He loved his act which was filmed in a medival town in Bavaria in 1971.
Here in Hamelin we have an excellent Artist and musician who plays the Pied Piper every year in the summer at the local marketplace - together with the rats and missing children.",1425081600,,453,4.159090909090909

3443953,4,B0019UGYD2,"I'm a bit mystified by some previous comments about this film being ""dated"" -- it's certainly of its time, but that's one of its many strengths. Period films set in the Middle Ages had a particularly authentic look & flavor when made in the late 1960s/early 1970s, a certain grimy reality made all the more pointed by the 60s/70s tone of the filmmakers. It was an ideal allegorical window for not only examining the ignorance & fanaticism of the past in scathingly satirical detail, but an equally ideal way of commenting on the present as well. Because of course everything that the film says about religious intolerance, political squabbling, greed, bigotry, the love of power, the abuse of the poor & helpless, anti-intellectualism -- in short, every aspect of humanity at its worst -- is just as applicable to the present day. Some might even say more so.

Having said that, let me add that it works just as superbly as a faithful retelling of the classic tale, without any pandering to the audience or a false happy ending. Donovan, who wrote the music & songs as well as playing the titular character, is good in his role -- his fey, otherworldly persona suits that of the Piper to perfection. And he's ably surrounded by fine actors: in particular, a very young John Hurt, playing a nasty & vicious young German nobleman; Donald Pleasance as his father, obsessed with building a great cathedral to ensure safe passage into Heaven; and Michael Hordern as the Jewish doctor/alchemist, the wisest & most sensible man in Hamelin, who pays a terrible price for being humane & decent.

It seems to me that director Jacques Demy was influenced more than a little by Ingmar Bergman -- as in ""The Seventh Seal"", there's a traveling family of players, in many ways the POV characters for the audience; and the atmosphere of constant paranoia, dread, and looming despair is quite similar. There's also a strain of dark humor that emerges at unexpected times, adding to the ominous tone. And all of this without any CGI or inhumanly sculpted bodies in slo-mo! It's a film that really deserves to be much better known -- most highly recommended!",1401494400,8,2139,4.778378378378378

3443955,5,B0019UGYD2,Great movie although it was a little different.  Donovan did a great job as the piper and the rest of the cast did a great job as well!  Recommended if your a fan of the story!,1385337600,,176,3.861111111111111
3443956,5,B0019UGYD2,"I am very glad for the DVD I have never seen it in a cinima,

3443957,1,B0019UGYD2,"The year is 1349, and the people of Hamelin are building a cathedral in hopes of warding off the Plague.  The Burgermeister is happily planning the marriage of his daughter to the Barron's son (John Hurt), and a band of actors and a piper (Donovan) come to town.

I expected this 1972, Donovan movie to be a hippy-dippy, rock fairy tale, but I was way off.  It's dreary and pointless, with a completely forgettable script and soundtrack.  The film focuses on the Burgermeister's money problems, and the Piper story is almost an afterthought; his piping-the-children-away doesn't even merit a comment.

Donovan has no discernible acting talent or screen presence, mostly plays a modern guitar, and is a minor character.  Top-billed Jack Wild, so likable in ""Oliver!"" plays a disabled apprentice, but he is well-past his boyish-prime and adds nothing to the story.  Both children and adults will probably be bored by this cheap misfire.",1361664000,,934,5.025974025974026
3443958,4,B0019UGYD2,"My favourite period of history is the Middle Ages and I firmly believe this film sewed that seed when I was a child.

I have to confess I am a bit biased in favour of this film as I first watched it on TV at the age of about 10 (mid-70s) (my nose almost pressed to the TV screen!) and the memory of it clung vividly to me for years and years.  Not a ""children's film"" but a film that older children can still enjoy.  I never saw it again but remembered it most of all for the haunting melody that the Piper (Donovan) plays on his pipe to draw the children from the town and, on finally being able to purchase a copy last year, was delighted to find I had remembered it almost note for note after over 30 years.

On the down side it is, at times, not the best acted or scripted film, and it is very much of it's time (1972!) (hence the deduction of one star) but it has some lovely characters, both wicked and innocent, and a strange kind of beauty.  The true horror of the plague is missing, true, but the sense of confusion, intolerance and panic that it caused are very evident.  As a child I found the death of the scapegoated Jew horrifying and utterly bewildering.  As an adult I watched it with more understanding of man's inhumanity, particularly when confronted with fear and the unknown.

It's a funny little film but I really rather love it.",1336521600,,1351,4.229571984435798

  i am speaking about a particular Amazon website for this DVD, but Amazon has a bad tendency to put a review for a particular website on all the websites for a film. i'm talking about this particular website that is asking 999 dollars for this.

8275276,4,B0019UGYD2,"The Pied Piper,"" based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, is set in the Middle Ages as the town of Hamelin tries desperately to rid itself of the Black Plague. Donovan plays a mysterious musician who arrives in town promising to get rid of the towns rat infestation by playing his magical flute, but the townspeople cannot put aside their personal agendas and ask the piper to help them with other deeds, as the towns petty and greedy leader, the sinister Baron (Donald Pleasance), tries to take advantage of the new savior.

Donovan, a rock icon of the 1960s and early 1970s, is well cast and gets to play some tunes on guitar. He portrays the piper in low-key fashion, yet gives the impression that the Piper always has the upper hand and possesses the most significant bargaining chip as the corrupt town attempts to double cross him.

The supporting cast includes Jack Wild (The Artful Dodger in Oliver!) as a lame boy, and Michael Holdern as a Jewish alchemist belittled by the Church despite his level headedness and intelligence. Dina Dors, the 1950s blonde bombshell, appears as the Burgomasters wife, and a young John Hurt plays Franz, the power hungry suitor of the Barons daughter.

The exterior scenes are reminiscent of the Hammer Studio horror films made around the same time, giving an appropriate Old World look to the film. Though the film is rated G, it does contain a few creepy scenes with trained rats. The Pied Piper has never been on home video in the U.S. before. Directed by Jacques Demy (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg), The Pied Piper portrays a community rampant with greed, abuse of power, and autocracy. The presence of the Piper is the catalyst that shows the true colors of many residents thought to be decent, upstanding citizens.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1493078400,,1822,4.792993630573249
