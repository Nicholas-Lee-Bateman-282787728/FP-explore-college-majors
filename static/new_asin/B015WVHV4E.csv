7452782,2,B015WVHV4E,"*MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT#

After the serious disappointment of season 10, I had such hope for this one because of the plot.  And the plot of the Darkness of being the opposite of God and wanting to destroy everything God created is a cool and compelling idea. The season, as in season 10, started of really dramatic and gripping. Then when they brought in the actress of Amara, eh. I personally wished they'd picked somebody else for her actress. Emily Swallow is weird looking and a cheesy actress,

So, her thing with being God's sister was...a bit much. I mean God's sister? Way too over the top. And then the writers just keep fumbling what side she's one, I mean she clearly hates everything her brother created  but she likes Dean? She was not an appealing villain, not at all. What really started the downward spiral for me Amara is one of the SLOWEST moving plots ever. Like all the scenes between young Amara and Crowley, I felt were unnecessary. They bored me to death. All she did was steal souls and grow up. Didn't even kill Crowley like i wished she would. Not the most exciting thing ever.
And then to top it all off they wrap up her arc with a laughable, anti-climatic season ending.  After ALL the death and destruction she causes, she realizes, at the LAST second while the sun is dying, ""Oh, I love and miss my brother after I nearly killed him and killed thousands of his creations"".
This is total CRAP. For one thing, I'm pretty sick of them not giving villains the death they richly deserve, like Crowley and Rowena. But this complete 180 in her personality in like, 5 minutes? Jeremy Carver, you lazy, good for nothing director!

After all this drama about how much of His creation she's killed to get back at Him, how angry and vengeful she's been portrayed the WHOLE FREAKING SEASON, they just expect me to believe she suddenly feels sorry? What kind of garbage is that? That is the worst writing I've ever seen! Don't sell me this BS that Light and Dark coexist blah blah blah. That was one the stupidest wrap-ups I've seen since season 8. Jeremy Carver has sucked as a director from day one and thank God this is the last season he's directing. I don't know if its just him but the past 4 seasons he's been in charge of, have had major plot flops/collapses. Famous example: the Trials. I really miss the days when Supernatural had power and kept me on the edge of my seat.

Another stupid collapse is all throughout the season they keep harping about Dean and Amara's ""bond"", giving us sinister feels about it and hinting that Dean and Amara will end up together only for that to fizzle out into a big steaming pile of NOTHING. Not that I wasn't relieved, I actually was. That whole subplot was really cliche honestly but why even do it? What was the point if it led to nowhere? Of course this isn't the first plot twist of the show's ever that fell flat, but it seems like that's all these new seasons are nowadays! Season 10 was chalk full. That is called Lame Writing and it makes me wonder if the writers are even trying anymore to impress us.

But then what I don't get it is Supernatural can still do awesome episodes, Baby, Thin Lizzie, Just my Imagination, The Devil's In The Details, The Vessel, Red Meat, Don't Call me Shurley, those were all golden. Classic Supernatural. And I was relieved and appreciative that they finally have the boys working together instead of fighting the whole freaking season. even trying to bring back that brotherly camaraderie. All of that is awesome BUT it doesn't make up for the stupid, half-assed season wrap up. Not to me.

Now having Castiel being possessed by Lucifer in Devil's in the Details was the best thing they've done to him in a long time. What  they've done to Castiel over the years from angel, to God to...human and then angel again--they've drug him along and evolved him in ways that don't entertain me anymore . I was a fan of him at first but it seriously feels like he's lost his purpose. They are deliberately keeping on because his actor is so popular but he's downright boring now. Being possessed by Lucifer actually made him very  entertaining. Too bad he doesn't stay that way. Honestly, I wouldn't mind if they did away with him. He's a tired character.

There's another severe disconnect in this season to earlier seasons: Lucifer and Sam. I mean towards the end they just seem to downplay everything  Lucifer did to Sam,and by downplay I mean the brothers act as if none of it mattered. And then Sam and Dean are treating Lucifer like some spoiled teenager at one point? What the !@$%$% is that? This guy nearly destroyed Sam in season 7, was indirectly responsible for their entire family and many friends being killed, was their worst enemy for the longest time--and they just act like they have to parent him now? Again, What the !@$%$% is that?
That was not funny at all, that is offensive and a slap in the face of everything he's done to them. How the writers portray Sam and Dean just shirking off all that trauma is maddening, unrealistic and stupid.

As for Chuck's performance as God--really? God--the Creator of everything--is an insecure, bi-sexual, apathetic, hack writer with family issues and needs help from two imperfect humans to get straight? That didn't fly with me at all and, besides being offensive, it was ridiculous. I could've done without bringing God in there at all if they were gonna do that. If they were looking to make me laugh or amuse me they failed. Oh and METATRON, the ultimate most irritating, WORST actor ever gives God a lecture on LOVING humanity? After what he's done? Give me a break! The irony of that scene was preposterously rankling. Not funny or emotional as they probably wanted it to be, but rankling. They weren't even trying to convince you of that loser's redemption, they just threw that at you and expected the audience to feel sorry for the little weasel. What the load of crap!

So overall, the season was the severe disappointment. I mean I'm supposed to like how they ended the Darkness plot? With some half-assed regret on Amara's part? And then they ditch earth and leave the brothers in charge of it, thinking it'll be ok? How many times have Sam and Dean nearly killed the world by their choices? HA! That is laughable, and not in a good way. They're all screwed.
I remember when I used to marvel at Supernatural's endings, now I laugh. Is Sloppy the theme for Supernatural nowadays? Because that describes this entire season perfectly.

Since season 8, every season has been like 30% awesome, the other 70% is lame writing/stupid bro fights. When every season for the past 5 years has had the same problems, its time for a change of director. Or just end the show, please.
Anyway, its not worth buying for me. I only liked 10 episodes out of the whole thing, its a waste of hard-earned money. Sam and Dean are still amazing actors but with plots like this, is there any point in watching it?

But on a final note: they DID manage to make me look forward somehow to the next season with Mary Winchester's return and the Men of Letters plot. I'll tune in for a bit but if I start to see the same cycle of stupid, like them making their mom evil or some other crap, I'm done. When Kripke left he took the best of the show with him, now the writers seem to be just abusing a good show.",1456358400,16,7345,4.527149321266968
7452783,5,B015WVHV4E,"Supernatural is an amazing show with some pretty hot actors and an a amazing plot. Fun Fact: I watched all 10 seasons in a week. I just know I will love this season. But to all haters, 'Up yours', as Dean would say.  When is the release date though?",1455753600,18,249,4.081632653061225
7452784,5,B015WVHV4E,"If you don't love or even like this show then why must we continue to hear your hate. Don't watch!! The quality of the actors on this show is beyond talented. You can see by the way they are with their fans that they put their whole beautiful selves into this show. Even the original creator, Kripke  still loves what they are doing. Haters should go away.",1455408000,15,356,4.313432835820896
7452785,5,B015WVHV4E,"This show has been a favorite from day one.  I absolutely love the Winchester brothers and their story as well as the actors that play them.  I have never once felt disappointed in the show or that it's gone on too long.  As far as I'm concerned, I dread the day it ends.  I would love it if it went on forever or at least as long as Jared and Jensen still love playing the brothers.  Each season is better and better.  It never ceases to amaze me or make me smile.",1455062400,40,465,4.0
7452786,5,B015WVHV4E,"Supernatural is near the top of my list in good TV viewing. Some seasons and episodes are better than others but the show keeps a high bar on normally good writing. Despite what one person said Crowley and Castiel are well liked characters and supply some occasional nice humor without getting campy or dumb. Besides what other show gives you angels. demons, ghosts, vampires, shape changers, witches and other badies to stop.
Oddley enough I found a book from the 1920's called ""Men of Letters"" - who knew - hee hee. Anyway, may Sam and Dean continue on their adventures as long as they wish. The current season features the threat of Darkness, now free after being imprisoned for countless ages - she is the sister of God supposedly and wants revenge for her long containment. Mankind beware!",1448064000,39,794,4.760869565217392
7452787,1,B015WVHV4E,Seasons 1-7 were good but then Carver took over and the show crashed and burned aside from Ryan Collins which looks professionally and one and the other that needs to use capitals which is yelling on the internet and tells they're a love it this week hate next week type. Carver was quoted as he wanted to turn Supernatural a horror/fantasy show into a soap opera. Yeah wrong choice of show runner. Sera Gamble's taking over for the creator Eric Kripke lost a lot of viewers because if the show runner wasn't Kripke they weren't interested. Then the network showed their love by placing the show on the death night Friday. Most people are out because they don't need to work the weekend and not watching tv. Yet she kept good ratings of 1.2-2.9 from Kripke's 2.0-3.9. Carver takes over and the show is moved to wed a night when people stay home and watch tv. Carver's 1st ep was rated at 0.8 and his highest was 1.0 for season 8. Season 9 low 0.7 highest 1.2. Season 1 low 0.8 highest 1.1. Season 11's have ranged 0.6-0.9. The ratings are definitely slumping with the over the top soap opera and teen angst none of which I'm interested in watching not to mention the change in characters to saintSam and floormatDean. They used to be brothers now they're Sam and his servant. When you have fans interested in selling their Supernatural dvd's from season 8 on you know you've screwed up. Somebody find a show runner who knows what the hell they're doing.,1448064000,16,1453,4.52851711026616
7452788,5,B015WVHV4E,"It's been over a decade since Supernatural first aired in 2005 on what was then the WB. Since then there have been changes in writers, directors, actors, showrunners, and even the network, but the song is still the same, and it's every bit as good now as it's ever been. Season 10 ended as big as Supernatural's ever gone with the escape of the primordial Darkness, and season 11 picks up shortly after this point in true Winchester fashion.

I'll be updating this review when I have the box set in hand with a rundown of the extra features, and periodically as the season goes should the quality change, but thus far the show has proven itself to still be one of the best paranormal mystery/action thrillers on television. It's a rare thing for a show to go for more than a decade without stagnating or becoming dull. Supernatural has not only managed to pull that off, but honestly seems to only get better with age.

One final point I want to make. If you watch the show online, then please be sure to buy this DVD/BR set. Supernatural has been around for a long time, it even survived the 2007 writers guild strike that wound up killing the momentum of so many other shows (Heroes, Prison Break, Lost, etc). Supernatural has been, and continues to be, a masterpiece of entertainment. With piracy at an all time high, and with the economy the way it is, it's more important than ever to support fantastic and original shows like this in order to keep them going for all to enjoy.",1444521600,123,1482,4.5055762081784385

Episode List

1. Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire""
Sam and Dean meet a young sheriff's deputy named Jenna who claims people have been going rabid and killing each other. A man whose wife has died has a newborn baby with him but he is infected. He insists on giving the baby to Jenna and the Winchesters, naming her Amara before he dies. Dean is haunted by a vision of The Darkness telling him he set her free and they are now linked into always helping each other. Dean wants to kill the infected and escape with the baby but Sam wants to try and cure them. Sam acts as a diversion allowing Dean and Jenna to escape, though Sam gets infected. Castiel struggles to control himself from inflicting more violence due to Rowena's attack dog spell, and is captured by two angels when he begs for help. Crowley regroups after narrowly escaping Castiel's attempt on his life, hearing that The Darkness has set off ancient alarms in both Heaven and Hell. As Jenna is changing Amara's diaper, she sees the Mark of Cain on her left shoulder.

2 ""Form and Void""
Dean takes Jenna to her grandmother's home and leaves to help Sam. However, Amara begins levitating her toy blocks and Jenna's religious grandmother calls an exorcist while Jenna calls Dean. Dean arrives to find the ""exorcist"" to be Crowley who explains that he senses an ancient darkness in the child. At the same time, Jenna visits Amara and then suddenly murders her grandmother. Investigating the noise, Dean finds the Mark of Cain on Amara and remembering it on the woman from his vision, realizes that Amara is the Darkness. Confronting Jenna, Crowley realizes that she is now soulless, Amara having consumed her soul. Dean and Jenna fight before Crowley kills her. Crowley reveals he intends to use Amara for his own purposes, but Dean incapacitates him only to find Amara, now grown into a young girl, gone. Crowley later approaches Amara with people for her to feed on. At the same time, two angels torture Castiel before Hannah saves him. When he asks about the location of the Winchesters, Castiel realizes it was a ruse to get information from him. The other two angels try to hack his mind, but Rowena's spell gives him the strength to break free and fight back. Castiel kills the other two angels, but not before they kill Hannah. An infected Sam works to find a cure to the Darkness' poisoning with little luck. He encounters a Reaper who informs him that him and Dean will be thrown into a void when they die and that he is ""unclean in a biblical sense."" As a result, Sam researches purifications from the Bible and finds a reference to holy oil. Using holy fire, Sam is able to cure himself and then save the remaining people in the town. Returning to the bunker, he and Dean find Castiel begging for help.

3 ""The Bad Seed""
Sam and Dean search for Rowena to cure Castiel as well as begin to try to find Metatron before the other angels do, for information on The Darkness. A demon tries to kill Rowena while she is attempting and failing to recruit witches for her Mega Coven, leading the Winchesters to her. Though they take the Codex from her she has hidden The Book of the Damned. Castiel loses control as the attack dog spell takes him over and goes rogue. While searching for him Rowena reveals the deal Sam made with her to kill Crowley if she removed the Mark of Cain from Dean, though Dean understands. Dean saves a woman from Castiel and is attacked by the angel. Rowena restores Castiel to normal and escapes. A low level demon and angel commiserate at a bar that the leaders of Heaven and Hell don't appear to be doing anything about The Darkness. Meanwhile Crowley is raising Amara and even he is unnerved by her power. Amara doesn't seem interested in a world of pure evil but she feeds on enough demons to make herself a teenager and demands Crowley bring her more.

4 ""Baby""
Seen entirely in and around the Impala: Sam and Dean head for a case where a sheriff's deputy was killed. Sam has a dream where someone or something appears to him as a younger John Winchester, telling him he and Dean have to stop The Darkness and: ""God helps those who help themselves."" Sam thinks this and his other vision from when he was infected mean God is helping them, though Dean is skeptical. Sam is attacked while trying to talk to the victim's wife while Dean is attacked by the replacement sheriff's deputy and finds out shooting it with silver and beheading it doesn't kill it. A call from Castiel explains it is a Nachzehrer, a ghoul and vampire-like creature. The wife wakes up and has been turned, kidnapping Dean in the car. She explains she killed her husband for not joining them and the new deputy is the alpha. The alpha is restored and explains he is scared of The Darkness so he is building an army. He will turn Sam, who is walking into a trap, and then they will eat Dean. Dean gets free and shoves copper pennies down the alpha's throat and decapitates him with the Impala's door, killing him and returning his victims to normal humans. Both bruised Winchesters agree to stop The Darkness after they heal, driving off in the battered Impala.

5 ""Thin Lizzie""
A young couple is killed in a hotel that used to be the home of Lizzie Borden. Sam and Dean quickly find all the paranormal signs in the hotel are fakes for the tourists. However, one of the hotel owners is killed, along with a man miles away from the hotel who is found by Sidney, the babysitter of his son Jordie. The wife Dawn has an unemotional reaction to her husband's death. Dean meets Len a Lizzie Borden fan who says he saw a girl named Amara wandering outside the hotel a few nights ago and he hasn't felt normal since he met her. Dean realizes Amara ate Len's soul. Suspecting Dawn to be soulless as well, the Winchesters find her and her lover dead in a house with Jordie tied up. Sidney captures the Winchesters explaining she also met Amara, who said she wanted to help Sidney. Sidney has felt blissful ever since her soul was taken, Amara helping her not care about her abusive childhood. Sidney killed her enemies and Jordie's parents for being abusive and plans to offer the Winchesters to Amara as a gift. Len saves the Winchesters by killing Sidney. Len can feel himself turning darker the longer he is without a soul so he turns himself in for all the murders to stop himself. The Winchesters send Jordie to an aunt and are concerned about Amara growing stronger. Amara watches them as they leave promising to see Dean soon.

6 ""Our Little World""
Amara eats the soul of a teenager named Goldie and ages slightly upward again. Crowley grounds Amara for sneaking out to eat and tries to convince her that he can be a father and teacher for her, while having her soulless victims killed to keep her a secret. Dean and Sam are still in the area and are called in once Len is killed in jail. Goldie is arrested and the Winchesters capture the assassin meant for her. After killing him, they track Crowley and Amara to an abandoned asylum to kill Amara. Sam fights off several demons while avoiding killing most of them to try and save the human hosts; he also has another vision. Crowley prepares to kill Dean but Amara stops him, declaring she doesn't need him and tortures Crowley into letting Dean go. Amara knows Dean won't kill her because of their link and says she'll soon be strong enough to exact her revenge on God. Meanwhile, Castiel sees Metatron on television and tracks him down, taking the demon tablet. Metatron is stuck as a human and films tragedies to sell to the media for money. Sensing a rage within Castiel, Metatron constantly mocks him, hoping to be killed since he hates being human. Castiel resists this, and gets Metatron to reveal that in order to make the world, God had to sacrifice His sister, The Darkness. Castiel deems Metatron harmless and lets him leave, to the Winchesters' shock. Dean lies and says Amara overpowered him. Sam is horrified to realize his visions are of The Cage where Michael and Lucifer are locked inside.

7 ""Plush""
After a man is murdered by someone in a bunny mask that won't come off, Sheriff Donna Hanscum calls in the Winchesters for help. After learning that the killer suddenly changed after putting the mask on, they come to believe it is a cursed object. Donna's deputy Doug is forced to kill the young man to save Donna and she and the Winchesters burn the mask and believe it to be over. However, a young woman in a jester mascot outfit brutally attacks the local football coach before being stopped by the school quarterback. After the quarterback tells them that the room suddenly got cold, the Winchesters realize they are dealing with a ghost who is possessing the various costumes and those who wear them. Using rock salt, they are able to free the latest possession victim, who tells them that the costume had recently been donated to the school. The Winchesters and Donna learn that the costumes belonged to a children's performer named Chester Johnson and after his suicide, his sister donated all of his costumes. Realizing Chester is the ghost, Donna and Doug collect all of the costumes and burn them while Dean talks to the first victim's widow and learns that Chester supposedly molested the children of the two victims. At the same time, Sam is unable to stop Chester from possessing another innocent victim and using him to finish off the coach. Chester's sister Rita explains that after she was confronted with the accusations of child molestation, she worried about her own son and helped the two men get to Chester to scare him. In doing so, Chester was accidentally killed and now wants revenge. Possessing Rita's son through the last costume, Chester attacks but Dean is able to remove the costume and Sam burns it, destroying Chester. At the same time, Sam prays to God for guidance on his visions and explains to Dean he thinks that they mean he has to return to Lucifer's Cage and that the answer to The Darkness may be there.

8 ""Just My Imagination""
A little girl's imaginary friend, Sparkle the unicorn-man, is killed. Sam is shocked to wake up and see his own childhood imaginary friend Sully is real. Sully explains he and Sparkle are Zn who appear to lonely children to cheer them up. Sully had done so for Sam when he wasn't allowed to go on hunts with John and Dean. Sully thought Sam wanted to be something other then a hunter and encouraged him to run away. However, John changed his mind and allowed Sam to join them so Sam rejects Sully as fake and Sully leaves hurt.

Reese and her twin sister Audrey were Sully's next children after Sam, but Audrey was killed by a car while playing tag in the street with Sully. Reese read the folklore and paid a witch for the ability to see Zn and a blade that can kill Sully's kind as revenge. Sully offers to die if that is what Reese needs, though the brothers talk her out of killing him. Sully agrees to check in on Reese and wishes Sam luck. Sam admits to Dean he thinks he has to go to the Cage. Dean says there must be another way, but has no idea what that could be.

9 ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""
A fully grown Amara kills religious preachers in a park and a church as attempts to get God's attention, dismissing religion as manipulation. Finally convincing Dean following the visions are their only choice, Sam and Dean approach Crowley for a way to communicate with Lucifer in The Cage. Crowley has Rowena captured to read from the Book of the Damned for this purpose and they form a tense alliance. Alone, Dean investigates the church deaths and senses Amara. She transports him away to talk, claiming she only wants to hurt God who supposedly exiled her because she might be better at making creations. She claims that she would rule the world to give everyone bliss like Dean feels with her. After Dean's attempt to stab her fails, Amara kisses Dean saying they are meant to be together ever since he freed her. A low level angel rallies all the angels in Heaven against Amara. He and two others go to arrest her, saying if she resists the combined might of every angel will kill her. Amara kills the three angels and sends Dean back to safety as the sky opens up and strikes her. The others proceed with the plan and Rowena wards The Cage while Sam speaks with Lucifer. Lucifer says The Darkness is equal to God in raw power and offers help if Sam agrees to be his vessel again. Sam refuses as the warding fails to Crowley's shock, though Rowena remains calm. Sam is pulled into The Cage where Lucifer reveals the release of The Darkness weakened The Cage and he's been the one sending Sam's visions and that God was never helping them.

10 ""The Devil in the Details""
Lucifer recently approached Rowena in a dream, promising her rewards if she helps him get to Sam. Dean searches for Sam and is sent by Crowley to Billie the Reaper who Sam had encountered recently. Billie lets Dean into Hell with a ""witch collar"" that allows Crowley to control Rowena. Castiel and a low level angel search to see if Amara survived while the angel points out Castiel is more expendable than the Winchesters. Amara survived and kills the other angel, then sends Castiel to Billie with a threat carved into his chest, though the effort of that does appear to weaken her. Meanwhile Lucifer says Sam has gone soft. Last time he fought him, he sacrificed himself to save the world. In recent years Sam and Dean only want to save each other regardless of the cost. Lucifer says making a sacrifice and being his vessel is the only way to stop The Darkness, since God is gone, Gabriel and Raphael are dead, and Michael has supposedly gone insane while imprisoned. Sam refuses, not believing its guaranteed Lucifer would win against Amara and even if it was, he'd then destroy the world himself. Lucifer pulls Dean and Castiel into The Cage and beats all three of them, though Rowena's spell seems to work to send him away. The brothers agree to find another way to stop Amara while Castiel hangs back. Castiel, having said yes at the last second to be Lucifer's vessel, goes to confront Crowley and Rowena. Lucifer makes sure Rowena is the only one who could open The Cage again and kills her, then saying he wants to talk to Crowley.

11 ""Into the Mystic""
Thirty years ago in Ireland, a man is killed after hearing a strange noise and being attacked. His wife banishes the creature but also dies, leaving only their baby alive. In the present day Sam and Dean investigate a case in a retirement home where one of the residents died in a similar manner. A resident named Mildred sees the creature commit its second kill of the building manager.

One of the wrestlers, Harley, is kidnapped by one of his fellow wrestlers, Gunner Lawless, who is working for a crossroads demon who is collecting souls to create his own ""nest egg"" because of the appearance of the Darkness and Lucifer's return. The demon overpowers the Winchesters and orders Lawless to kill Dean. Lawless explains that he had made a deal ten years before and the demon had promised to spare his life if he did its bidding.

Told as parallel stories, Bobby and Rufus already burned the bones of any possible ghost but that doesn't solve the problem. Both pairs realize it is a soul eater, an undead being which takes souls to a nest that exists outside of space and time, resembling the house it haunts, while leaving the human bodies to die. Bobby and Rufus don't know how to kill it so they settle for a trap to seal it, which Bobby had previously used in another home in Tennessee. This same seal was broken during the renovations at the start of the Winchesters case. Sam is able to use information from The Men of Letters to find another seal that will kill it, but someone must also place it in the nest. Both Dean and Bobby are taken into the nest and are soon possessed by the soul eater, attacking their partner in the real world.

While Cesar and Dean search for the burrow in the woods, Sam and Jessy confront the sheriff from 27 years ago. The sheriff had attacked the burrow but saw his own daughter was turned and was forced to kill her. Wanting to hide what happened, he told Jessy he was just a crazy kid, enraging him. Dean and Cesar find the burrow in a mine and kill the Bisaan, however the current hosts are already dead so they burn down the eggs.

Meanwhile,the Winchesters investigate a murder-suicide and soon learn it is a stronger version of the infection fog that is making the townspeople go mad. Chuck reveals he's been traveling the world and only wants to talk about things he's done as a human. Metatron's criticism of Chuck's writing gets him to reveal he has some sympathy for Lucifer turning into a villain because of the Mark of Cain and the burden of containing Amara. He likes the Winchesters and constantly brought back Castiel for them, but their quest to destroy the Mark is what freed Amara, so he is done helping them. Since God is Being while Amara is Nothingness, Chuck became lonely and thought by creating things he could convince Amara to be better, but she just destroyed everything.

7452911,5,B015WVHV4E,"Season 11 itself: 5 stars, although this is kind of an odd season. The Darkness/Amara was kind of strange, but she ended up growing on me. But the episode ""Baby"" was beyond awesome and having the Chuck story line finally paid off was rewarding. (Also - I got to discover that Rob Benedict has an absolutely amazing singing voice!)

The blu-ray: 5. A couple commentaries and a handful of featurettes. When compared to season 10 it's a 4-star rating, but when compared to the entire 11 season run of extras, it's towards the top. So, in the end, a solid 5 stars for the extras.",1487980800,,575,4.476190476190476

The stakes are higher than ever before in this season where GOD Himself(not the real one of course!) makes several appearances! Crowley is still scheming while his mom, Rowena, has much, MUCH higher plans. GOD apparently has a sister(matching some ancient Sumerian/Canaanite texts) and She does not get along with HIM and is out to kill GOD. Some of the most shocking scenes ever in a suspense thriller TV show are what this season brings! GOD, Rowena, the Winchesters, and Crowley along with all the angels and demons, including Lucifer/Satan, team together to fight Darkness, GODs sister.

7453009,5,B015WVHV4E,"As cautious as I am going to be, its possible this review contains spoilers.
At the end of season ten, when the darkness was unleashed, I had high hopes for season eleven. It definitely has it a high points, but let me start where it's lacking. First, the dragging thru the first few episodes felt like filler. I understand the concept behind what they were trying to do, but it just felt blah. Second, the darkness and Dean's connection just wasn't well portrayed. I just wasn't getting the vibe that they had any chemistry, and personally, the actress who plays the darkness was average at best. So far all the characters in the series seemed to be played well by their actors/actresses, but the performance of the darkness just seemed lacking.
Neither of these took away from the season in my opinion for a few reasons. First, Misha Collins new role was exceptional. He has portrayed every part in this show impeccably, but this may be my all time favorite. Second, the introduction/ reintroduction of an old character who most were sure fell out of existence (no spoilers here but every one knows who I mean) was the pivotal moment the season was leading up to. Seeing them last season, I knew something big was coming, and it hit the nail on the head. Third, the show still manages to stick to its roots. I love the new monsters, that's what hooked me in the beginning and it still entices me today. I love the laughs I still get, I think they are more prominent as the seasons go by. I love the general feels from this show, the roller coaster of emotions. Last but never least, Jim Beavers tolkien episode always reminds me of the good old days. I hope they keep that up thru the course of the show.
Overall, I was highly impressed. The great outweighed the minimal amount of bland and I'm looking forward to owning season twelve.",1482710400,6,1837,4.536144578313253

I know it's just a show, but, that's not what I feel God looks and acts like.  That's why I gave it 4 stars, because of the God episodes.  But there were other stories that was very good, their usual fighting monsters.  Still, I'm not sorry that I purchased S-11.  I did love the part when they all came together to destroy the darkness.  I will continue to watch the series and hopefully they will come up with better ideas.",1482624000,,551,4.3431372549019605

It's no different than most shows, as the main idea of the show repeats throughout the seasons, but unlike a lot of recent series, this one continues to find new, engaging trials and tribulations for the two heroes, alongside their normal ""Saving people, hunting things"" ethos. Not to mention the great blend of comedy, drama, suspense, and character building that makes this series worthy of all of the Netflix binge memes it has spawned. The menus/episodes are easily accessible, unlike some TV series DVD's, there's some good extras, including a pretty funny gag reel, and for buying it right when it came out, I felt I got a good price on it.",1480032000,7,700,4.745901639344262

7453100,5,B015WVHV4E,"Being  huge fan of Supernatural, I was dismayed that my DVR skipped recording a few episodes of Season 11. So, I ended up skipping the rest of the season and awaited the Blu-ray release.

As an avid fan, I have watched each and every season more times than is probably healthy. But, there was always something about Sam & Dean's relationship that always stuck in my craw...the repetitive lies and secrets borne of personal shame. These are brothers whose dynamic was more father/son in my opinion, who would (and have) died for each other and the world time and again. With a love so strong, the lies and deception always smacked of an extremely unhealthy co-dependency upon each other that was getting old season after season. One would lie to the other for most of a season, they would either split or remain on the verge of splitting up, and then the season finale cliffhanger.

This season however,  the deception is small in comparison, and is revealed much quicker. The guys talk. It's forgotten. They become stronger for it and the understanding betwixt the two. Almost like brothers, and that in itself brings the boys back full circle. I refuse to fall into that fan crap of the supposed underlying incestuous relationship, and really wish it would stop. The real world is ugly enough, and the fantastical situations these guys get into are fierce enough.

Frankly, this season is the best in a while, in my opinion...at least until we get further into season 12. I  do wish that both Bobby and Benny would make a long-term return.",1477008000,,1540,4.727611940298507

Rowena, Crowley, Castiel, LUcifer, the men of letters, god, angels, Chuck, Am surprise they were able to fit and tell all these story arcs in 23 1 hour episodes.  Cant wait for season 12 to start in less than a month now, so I can start watching sam/dean get told off by their Mommy.heheheheeh the cheezyness plus monsters, babes, angels, and the men of letters.  Whos gotta get spank by mommy first dean or sam? hehehehe

Sad that charlie had to die last season but who knows maybe god will bring her back?  Plus I would love to see Death Return?

Overall a great set for us Supernatural Fans.  disc, packaging, UV copy, and inserts were all there and no damage.  I wish they had a extra disc or if they could fit all the trailers, tv spots, or next episode previews of each supernatural episode for that season in a set.  I wouldnt mind paying a extra 5$ to have that extra on a 5th bluray disc along with more deleted scenes, interviews, etc.  Still extras was not a big thing for me on tvshows. Though am pretty sure some of us fans have wondered for extras that putting all the episode trailers that was shown after each supernatural episode as a extra on the dvd/bluray.",1474934400,5,1249,4.367965367965368

7453179,5,B015WVHV4E,"MOST folks---because of the economy I guess---do not agree that video-piracy is hurting media.
The folks that out-source Supernatural aren't doing it for just out of love; they're trying to make a
living. If you SEE it without paying for it, ""they"" get no compensation. I suppose more money is
made via Blu-ray/DVD sales... but, most folks just DON'T buy the hard-copies anymore... but I do!

I love all TWELVE SEASONS! Know how rare THAT is? Gilligan's Island: 3 ; Andy Griffith Show: 8.

7453194,5,B015WVHV4E,"I came rather late to the game with this show; I first rented DVDs of season 6 when I was looking for something new and different...and got immediately hooked.  I watched a couple more seasons forward, then went all the way back to the beginning, and...well, you get the picture.
-Supernatural- has lasted 11 seasons now, and shows no signs of either slowing down, decreasing in quality, or (horrors!) getting boring.  After the season 10 finale, you get an opener that is surprising in more ways than one, and from there it only gets better.  (It's -really- hard to do this without spoilers, but you should probably do your imagination stretches before the workout of watching!)  There are some new monsters, of course, as well as new twists on old ones, and for once the Winchester boys meet a creature species that is actually benevolent!  There are some surprising alliances made, as well as some mistakes on the ""Augh! No, DON'T DO THAT!"" level, and we get to meet the Reaper who steps in for Death after his (apparent?) demise--and she's soooo not happy with Sam and Dean.  There's a whole list of ""Whatever happened to X?"" that gets checked off, and some ""payoffs"" from former seasons that pop back up (sigil watchers, take note).  And this season's finale sets us up for yet -another- can of worms to be opened...maybe even more than one!  All in all, just plain awesome.
One final note.  Unlike many, I -depend- on these box sets, as my TV is not in contact with the outside world (I had a major argument with our local cable provider).  Consequently, I am always a year behind.  Which means, any spoilers carelessly dropped by others strike -my- little world with the impact of a medium-yield nuke.  And I encountered one, on this site, a couple of months ago when I first pre-ordered.  So my PSA for this review is: Spoilers are rude, dude.  So don't.

It was something epic, and the final scene? Mindblowing. Watch it to find out! I meant to get the DVD version, since I have all the other seasons in DVD and I'm a traditionalist when it comes to SPN, but this was a birthday gift and I'm not complaining. It's my first Blu-Ray version of any Supernatural season, and I think I will enjoy the enhanced quality of the visuals, especially during the final episodes!

All I can leave you with is, Chuck stole my heart. I love him so much! Chuck and his family are just amazing. I want more Chuck, please!

This review is based on what I watched on TV, not this Blu-Ray version, since I haven't watched it. I just own it, and the packaging is great, as well as the discs. They are cinched in tightly, won't fall out, and are perfectly scratch and blemish free.

I'd put it right after season 7 as the 2nd weakest season of the entire series. While season 11 had some interesting episodes, & seemed to capture some of the road tripping magic of the first 4 seasons, the apex of this seasonal journey was as disappointing & weak as Matrix Revolutions. SPOILERS:
 'The war is over!' The Darkness was just really lonely. Chuck's / God's 'sister' just missed Him & now after putting aside their differences they're going on vacation to make up for lost time. The last 3 episodes had me rolling my eyes & laughing at how ridiculous the writing became. I give the first half of the season 4 stars & the last half 2 stars= 3 stars overall.  I would love to see Supernatural continue, but in the future they need to come up with a more fulfilling storyline than season 11 or this cult favorite may finally come to a close.",1473379200,6,1007,4.408602150537634

7453218,5,B015WVHV4E,"I've loved this show since season one, and while some seasons are better than others, each season is still full of great acting and storylines. This season had the biggest threat that was even more dangerous than the Apocalypse with Lucifer from season 5. The Darkness, the big sis of God and as powerful as God and Death is a great story. Also loved the return of Lucifer because his character is very humorous as well as a great villain. Because the threats were so dangerous, this was one of my favorite seasons like season 5 was, a war for the fate of mankind, light versus dark, family, love, twists and turns, secret alliances, and sacrifices. This season has it all.",1465171200,7,673,4.570247933884297
7453219,5,B015WVHV4E,"I agree with the majority of reviewers - the show is still going strong and is always awesome. It's an amazing blend of heart, horror, and humor and Season 11 ended with the usual bang of a cliffhanger. Those who think the show is/has been going downhill - well stop watching it if it isn't up to your expectations. Only and idiot would wade through watching something they hate only to complain about it later. Idjits.",1464825600,25,419,4.526315789473684
7453220,5,B015WVHV4E,"I loved all 10 seasons of Supernatural but I must say season 11 is fantastic!  The way the brothers are opening up to each other and supporting each other make this show great.  I can't wait for the season 11 DVD to be released and I am looking forward to watching season 12 in October.
I just wish that the CW would give this show the respect and support it deserves instead of ignoring it in favor of promoting that kiddy crap they seem to like now.

I hope that that Supernatural lasts for many more seasons!  If it does, I will be watching.",1464566400,16,544,4.201923076923077
7453221,1,B015WVHV4E,"This season, like every other season in recent years, had great potential with God, Lucifer and Amara. Yet as always they screwed up. After being locked up for 5 seasons the best the writers could do with Lucifer is have him outwitted by a low level demon Crowley? Really?! The last 4 episodes are what made me decide to stop watching the show. I watched from the beginning up to the current season so that is really saying something. For 11 years fans have wanted God on the show and they decided to have Chuck play God who was just pretending to be a prophet the entire time. Horrible writing and the reveal and finale were immensely anticlimactic. The whole conversation Chuck had with Lucifer when he says Lucifer is his favorite son just made me want to vomit. How about Jesus?! They have shown the anti-Christ but refuse to show Jesus. Just plain stupid! Dean has always been unable to live without Sam but now it seems every time Sam dies Dean immediately commits suicide. Watch Red Meat and Don't Call Me Shurley for reference. Anyone who has lost family members in real life know that people don't act like that. Seriously, the brothers inability to cope with dying is laughable as it is sickening. For anyone who is reading this as a long time fan and hasn't seen season 11 do yourself a favor and stop watching this show. Clearly the actors only care about the money now and it shows especially in the acting. If you watched the season finale all the actors were bored. Never in any previous season finale was there such a lack of intensity in the acting. What made me decide to quit the show was the writers lack of creativity, passion and slow paced storytelling. Another thing is there are no more satisfactory villain kills by the brothers. They never killed Metatron until Amara did. After the season 9 finale I wanted to see Dean kick his arse and then kill him. Same goes for Crowley. He killed Sam's girlfriend and there hasn't been any payback. Sam made an effort in season 10 but that was poorly executed. Also, Crowley shouldn't have been the one to kill Meg because she was one of the series main antagonist for the brothers and her death should've been by the brothers' hands. I could keep going but I've already rambled a bit too much.",1464307200,9,2260,4.528117359413203

7453223,5,B015WVHV4E,This series never gets dull.  I have been a die-hard fan from the very beginning and I've yet to lose interest.  The storyline stays true in Winchester fashion and just when you think it's gotten so good and how in the world can the writers top that they indeed do not disappoint.  I'm still waiting for God to make His appearance.  Maybe His sister will get a rise outta him.  Time will tell.,1461283200,16,393,4.328767123287672

7453225,5,B015WVHV4E,"I have watched Supernatural from the very first episode all the way through every season.  I absolutely love this show.  While some episodes haven't been favorites of mine, the actors are still excellent in every episode, and that still leaves a ton of wonderful episodes to watch over and over.  I have every season on DVD and sometimes it's a very pleasant way to spend a weekend, and especially watching some of the earlier episodes.  Over the years I see that the show has gathered new, younger fans, and that just goes to show how great this show is.  It appeals to a wide range of fans.  I never thought this show would be on for more than one season since my favorite shows always seem to get cancelled, so I have been excited every season to see it return.

7453226,5,B015WVHV4E,"Supernatural is one of the best horror/ thriller shows on TV. Right up there with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I've been watching this show since '05, or well, my mom and I watched. Cause she was a huge fan too. We could never get enough.

Sadly my mom passed in April of 2010 so she never got to see season 5. But when Angel's were brought on, and they started getting into the apocalypse etc. My mom was thrilled. So she would've loved S5.

But, to make a point. What's with all the hateful comments? Since when has this show gone down hill? Are these people even watching the same show that us SUPPORTERS are? I've never once seen Sam act like a Saint or Dean act like a floormat.

But you know what I have seen. Every single time these boys have shown one thing. They're brothers, they would do anything for each other. Go to the ends of the earth for one another. Even if that meant losing themselves. And that point gas been made every season.

But I guess, haters gonna hate. We're gonna play. And just Shake it Off!!!",1458432000,13,1022,4.27979274611399

8734796,3,B015WVHV4E,"Supernatural has had ""ups & downs"" since it's magnum opus....the season 5 finale. But in my opinion; this is the best complete season since the closing of season 8. While it doesn't have a ""great"" season resolution....simply a family spat between God (Chuck) & Amara, reduced to a kiss & makeup session, we do have the satisfaction of eliminating one Angel & gaining an entertaining witch and the Return of Samantha Smith (Mary). As a +, the fans see an united front against total destruction. While we Don't get truely great villains of the past....The yellow-eyed demon-Azazel/Lilith/Lucifer/the mother of all monsters....there's some of that Winchester magic Seasons 1-5. Unfortunatley, for a while now, Supernatural seasons are ""hit or miss"". I'm hoping that after a great season 13,the producers,writers,directors give us ""the fans"", a strong ending.....maybe season 15? That would be an fitting end, because Supernatural was for many seasons - the BEST tv series on any network. Carry on Wayward Sons & now the Wayward Sisters spin-off? Who would've have thought it; way back in the fall of 2004? Would've given it 3 1/2, but that's not an option on Amazon.",1527984000,,1163,5.0942408376963355
