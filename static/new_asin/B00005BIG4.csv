1424212,5,B00005BIG4,"Wow, this is really excellent workout DVD. Since it is DVD, it is so easy to use everyday unlike VHS tape. I was looking for this kind of the excercise system for long time. It is very easy and fun to follow.",996883200,9,208,3.9761904761904763

1424214,5,B00005BIG4,This is the 3rd dvd I purchase because I use it so much it gets scratched. Works great for me and I'm 57.,1473120000,,105,3.608695652173913

1424216,5,B00005BIG4,This was my favorite workout when I was in my late teens! (I am in my 30's) I am so excited that I was able to find a replacement for my scratched up one. They are all really good workouts. You will definitely feel them the next day!,1461801600,,233,3.875
1424217,5,B00005BIG4,"Fantastic low impact work out, but will get the heart going, loved it for years, had to buy again",1461801600,,97,4.157894736842105
1424218,4,B00005BIG4,"This CD include nine ten-minute workouts. I loved the five kickboxing ones - the instructor is pleasant, the workouts intense in a good way, and they really get your heart pumping. However, I found the four dance awful. An overly-peppy instructor doing complicated moves that involve more fancy footwork than exercise. I never use that half, but I'm still glad I purchased this since I like the other routines so much.",1456963200,,418,4.901408450704225

1424220,5,B00005BIG4,"I LOVE this workout DVD. I only got it last week but have used it religiously every day since. I've done all three sections (legs & arms, abs and butt) but I'm absolutely in love with the ab workout. I get my butt handed to me every time; I sweat like crazy and I can feel the burn. I know that sounds like a bad thing, but it's not lol. Each section has 3 ten minute workouts; doing different things to keep you interested...I do all 3 ab workouts every day (for a total of 30 minutes) and it goes by so fast. I've added this to my treadmill routine as well as smaller portions and a healthier diet and I feel GREAT. I can already feel my abs getting tighter, my stomach is less bulgy and I've already lost a few pounds. I've NEVER raved about a workout before, ha...and to be honest, I've never bought a workout DVD before as they never peaked my interest. However, finally wanting to work on my abs again and the price, I couldn't pass it up. Definitely worth it...and more. Thank you!

I'm adding a picture of myself just before my workout today 1/27/16- I wish I had a 'before' to show the difference (not a huge difference) but there is a difference. I plan to continue using this DVD for a long time to come and will update and submit another photo in the near future to show better results.",1453852800,4,1298,4.21285140562249
1424221,5,B00005BIG4,"Once again the Quick Fix series never disappoints me. At first I thought the workouts were not advanced enough, but later in the workout things picked up nicely.

1424226,5,B00005BIG4,"I'm not a fan of exercise and think of elaborate ways to justify getting out of it, however, this dvd is great, love it, psychologically, being in 10 minutes blocks, I do it, you watch the clock and when you think enough and you realise you can do it. I have even increased to doing more than the 30 mins.",1409961600,,305,4.1
1424227,4,B00005BIG4,I only like to workout for 20 mins no more this is great for programming what workout you want to do  I felt the workout its basic but works,1400803200,,140,3.8275862068965516

1424229,5,B00005BIG4,I have been doing this video before it became a DVD.  My video died and thank goodness I found it on DVD.  I am Mrs. Basko and over 60 and do not look it.  This DVD helps me stay strong and very healthy.,1387152000,,203,3.6744186046511627

1424231,1,B00005BIG4,"Didn't enjoy this DVD format or workouts. I didn't give it much of a chance, but I know what I like when it comes to workouts, and this wasn't it. Sold it at Half Priced Books.",1382486400,,176,3.9166666666666665
1424232,5,B00005BIG4,Love that you can make it a long or short workout depending on mood and your time. Highly recommended for those with little time to work out. Great for all levels.,1371081600,,163,4.290322580645161
1424233,5,B00005BIG4,"Sometimes I have to squeeze in a 10-min session here n there, so this is great. When I have more time, I find it a good workout. I saw some reviews complaining of not enough repetition, or too much explaining, but that can be easily remedied by just doing the exercise while they talk.
Like most things you get what you put into it. I will say I liked it enough to give my mother in law a copy when she mentioned her workout plans.",1362528000,,431,4.08235294117647
1424234,5,B00005BIG4,"I hate doing Cardio, but this DVD was fun. The ability to customize the workout was nice. You can do the routines as a whole or select 10min segments for a workout.  Sometimes all I can do is squeeze in 10min here and there. The hip hop was challenging enough that it keeps me motivated to keep practicing.
The only thing I don't like us that it's hard to see what you're selecting in the DVD menu. The contrast is just hard to spot, but otherwise a great DVD.",1362528000,,460,4.168539325842697
1424235,5,B00005BIG4,"I just got this a couple days ago. Mine came in one disc with the option to make combinations of 1,2, or 3 ten minute workouts. I assume they fixed the two disc issue. I have done both the kickboxing and dancing and I definitely prefer the kickboxing. It really makes you sweat! I had a hard time following the dancing but I hope to have it down eventually with some practice. What I like most about this workout, as far as cardio goes, is that it is nice and quiet. I live on a second floor apartment and do my workouts at 6 in the morning. I needed something that would get my heart pumping in the morning without waking anybody up downstairs. This was perfect! I would definitely recommend it!",1358294400,2,696,4.28030303030303
1424236,5,B00005BIG4,"The abs workout part is great, the other six parts are kind of easy. Over all, good work out for beginners.",1357257600,,107,4.142857142857143
1424237,5,B00005BIG4,"I LOVE the idea of this workout format!!!  Nine different 10 minute workouts focusing on various muscle groups.  Customize your workout and pick 3 of the muscle groups/intensity levels you want to do that day!
The mix and match is awesome.  I find myself chanting ""It's only for 10 minutes"" when my muscles are screaming.  I hope these girls make more videos like this!",1346630400,,369,4.71875
1424238,5,B00005BIG4,"This video saved my body when I had babies and toddlers and no time for myself.  I would go through the day and remember the girls on the video saying ""Everyone has 10 minutes.""  You can do one 10 minute video and get a really good work out.  Have 20 minutes to spare? Do two.  30 minutes? Even better.  I LOVED the workouts.  They are fun, not boring at all, and you can definately feel them working.  For those not ready to commit to a complete program like Brazil Butt Lift, P90X, or Insanity, this is the way to go!",1343347200,,519,4.13
1424239,5,B00005BIG4,"I really liked the product, it is not boring at all, and I liked the combination of different workouts in one dvd",1337817600,,113,4.181818181818182
1424240,4,B00005BIG4,"I love Minna, Julie, and Nancy. Their 10 minute workouts are very effective and once you do one 10 minute exercise your ready for another 10 minutes. Next thing you know you've done 30 minutes, you're sweaty and closer to your goals. I would definitely recommend this for moms on the go and ladies short on time.",1335484800,,312,4.491228070175438
1424241,5,B00005BIG4,"This DVD is awesome! It has 2 different types of workouts (kick box & dance) with several different options to customize. It is fun, not cheesy and gets the heart rate up which was my goal!",1316563200,,189,4.277777777777778
1424242,5,B00005BIG4,"I don't understand people ranking the workout so low because it is 2 DVDs.  Sure I am sure it's annoying, but wouldn't you also want to take into consideration the actual workout...?
Anyway, I have a whole bunch of workout DVDs so I can continue to stay fit through my travels.  I have to say, this is really one of my favorites.  I consider myself advance fitness and both the kickbox and the dance sections get me sweating.  Sure the dance sections move a bit fast, but after a couple tries, I was able to keep up with the instructor and was thankful that the slow teaching sections went fast so I can get my heart rate up.  Instructors and background exercisers were excellent and not annoying.
The only one negative that I can think of is the music, especially in the kickboxing.  I know workout video music is usually pretty terrible, but I think this is probably the worst!  Doesn't detract, for me, the workout though!
If you are looking for a great cardio workout, get this video!!  You will NOT regret it!!",1287532800,2,1015,4.478260869565218
1424243,5,B00005BIG4,"I love this DVD. All though this wasn't my first time purchasing it, I would recommend it to any woman or man trying to get in the best shape of their life. I like having the ability to customize my workout. I can do all of the exercise or just one. It depends on how I feel, but it's wonderful. You will be able to feel the burn and the pain with each exercise you do. I am glad the I purchased this DVD again. Thanks!",1277078400,,419,3.883720930232558
1424244,4,B00005BIG4,"I have at least half a dozen Quick Fix DVDs, and I liked this one, too. But I do 60-90 minutes of the exercises to try and fatigue myself.",1256774400,,138,3.793103448275862
1424245,5,B00005BIG4,"I LOVE this DVD. I don't even think you can buy it in stores anymore; this is my third time purchasing because I've worn out two other DVDs! You can choose from nine 10-minute sessions: three abs, three butt, arms, legs, or arms and legs. I hate strength training but this video actually gets me to do it. The 10 minutes goes really quickly and using this video in conjunction with cardio (doing one abs segment 4x a week and arms and lower body 2x a week) helped me get my best body ever. The moves are simple, the transitions are nice and slow, and the girls are cute and not annoying. My favorite is the arm segment! It's hard to find good DVDs for toning your arms.",1253318400,,669,4.234375
1424246,5,B00005BIG4,"I LOVE this DVD!!  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  I bought it about 5 years ago, but then forgot about it since I went through two pregnancies and wasn't working out.  In my most recent pregnancy, I gained 45 pounds and have been on a MISSION to work it off (and to tighten my stomach after having twins, then a singleton, both via C-sections!).  I remembered I had this DVD and recalled the ab sections in particular are great.  I'm only 4 months since my c-section (and couldn't start working out until 6 weeks post-partum), and the results are tremendous already.  (The buns, arms and legs workout are great too, but I'm focused on abs right now.)  I love that I can choose if I have time for 10, 20 or 30 minutes, choose the workouts I want, the order I want to do them in, and then just hit Start.  I don't have to keep interrupting  my workout - it goes through my selections one after the other.  Anyway, all you need is a little bit of floor space.  I LOVE this DVD.  I'm back here to buy them for my sisters.",1249084800,,1025,4.147208121827411
1424247,5,B00005BIG4,"Absolutely recommend this DVD.  I am a 40 year old woman with two children (this is my hubbys acct - but since I use the DVD I wrote this review). I have used it myself a year on and off.  When I am ""on"" and taking the 10 minutes to do level 1 - I actually feel results in TWO days.  I love step 1..I feel Step 2 is VERY hard on the back and neck.  Step 3 is the advanced! This DVD is felt in both your upper and lower abs as well as the sides.  I have not used legs, arms, etc.
enjoy your day!",1239321600,,494,3.5794392523364484
1424248,3,B00005BIG4,"I had this one for about a year and couldn't stand the instructors any longer and sold it on Craig's List.  I found them to be very cheesy, and found the exercises to be basics that I can do on my own.  I was hoping for some innovative moves and also wanted some cardio, but just didn't find that.  I think this would be good for those looking for specific areas to tone, with little time in their day to to so.",1239235200,,411,3.9878048780487805
1424249,4,B00005BIG4,"I've had this dvd for a few years and it's one of my favorites for strength training/toning.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because there's nothing for chest or back.  Also, there's too much set-up for some of the exercises.  After you've watched it numerous times it's a little annoying to hear the slow, deliberate instructional set-up over and over again.  I'd rather them speed it up and as a beginner you can just watch a few times if you need the instruction.  Nevertheless the workouts are fun and effective, with some unique moves.  And it's great to be able to mix and match your workouts. You won't be bored!",1223683200,,615,4.545454545454546
1424250,1,B00005BIG4,"Unfortunately, this DVD is totally misleading. I purchased it as it states there is ONE DVD with Quick Blender for over 100 combinations of Kickboxing and Cardio Hip Hop.  Amazon states it is one DVD and the back of the box says to mix and match the 8 ten minute segments.  Why the back of the box says...""two heart pumping,innovative workouts togehter on one DVD, you'll never be bored again"", is very unclear.
There are TWO DVD's in this box, so if you want to purchase to separate workout videos, that is what you get here. I personally was looking for a mix and match combo.

~ Lee Mellott",1222387200,2,593,4.422018348623853
1424251,4,B00005BIG4,"This is a a good value for the money. No commercials at the front, and you can even skip through the brief chatter at the beginning of each workout segment (I was able to on my computer), or use that time to do a more thorough warm-up, such as the Callanetics warm-up. I agree that the stretching afterwards is not much--you might want to substitute stretches which would be more effective for your needs.

Plenty of variety in the workouts, and when you need more of a challenge, you can use heavier dumbbells, or add some in the 2nd buns workout once you get your balance (instead of the chair) and the 2nd arms workout (which really only uses the legs, go figure).  I would recommend either light weights with velcro straps that you could use on either wrists or legs, or the light dumbbells sold to walkers that have the built-in straps so you don't send them flying across the room. Also, once you are familiar with the workouts, you can go right into the exercises, getting a few extra reps in while the instructor is running through the explanations.

The lack of cardio may be an issue for some--I prefer to walk outside, so it wasn't a big deal to me.",1205884800,,1160,4.436619718309859
1424252,4,B00005BIG4,"I had to spend about 15 minutes watching a portion of each routine to see what they included.  There is no explanation on the DVD, the cover, or even the Current/ QuickFix web site.  With 9 routines, I had assumed that at least 3 of them would be cardio.  However, they are all toning.

The exercises are very effective.  The instructors are fine. (Other than Minna's wild 80's hair... Holy cow!)  The pace is slow enough to make each movement count.  All in all, this is a terrific toning DVD.  You just need to swap it with your cardio DVDs to get a complete workout.

These are a couple of cardio DVDs I enjoy:

But it is a fun and effective cardio workout, based on the same 10- minute routine idea.  This DVD has 3 10- minute cardio/ lite toning workouts, one concentrating on the core, another for legs and hips, and another for arms.  It also includes a 4th bonus 10- minute cardio kickboxing routine.  You can do the whole DVD or choose your own combo.
This DVD is good for everyone.  They are sure to include an instructor who demonstrates easier versions of the exercises throughout the workouts.

Still, it is intended as a cardio and toning workout... not a training routine for real kickboxing technique.  It's fun and allows you some options in choosing your routine.  It'll get you sweating.  Not a good choice for people who are not already working out regularly.",1203292800,,1897,5.636042402826855
1424253,5,B00005BIG4,"This DVD is great for someone like me who gets bored really easily, and I wish they made more in this format. They give you a bunch of workouts to choose from and you can select which ones you want to do and in which order. Each workout is only 10 minutes long and there is a clock counting down so you can see how much agony you have left, haha. The workouts aren't very agonizing though, they are simple enough and I have already seen results after 2 weeks. Highly recommended.",1198800000,,479,4.217391304347826

This video has helped me not only to lose a few inches off my waist, but also re-gain my self-confidence. Even you can devote only 10 minutes (!!!) a day or three times a week to become trimmer and healthier.",1197417600,2,391,3.8395061728395063
1424255,4,B00005BIG4,"This allows for a lot of combinations to tailor your workout. The clock on the bottom of the screen is really nice in letting you see how much more you need to hang in there to complete the workout. If you are a beginner, this is perfect. As an intermediate, it can give you a good workout without much trouble if you are in a hurry or are not in the mood for a more vigorous workout. The girls are not overly giddy and the steps/movements are clearly laid out.",1197158400,,461,4.133333333333334
1424256,5,B00005BIG4,"I really, honestly love this workout - I tell everyone I know about it. The ten-minute segments are nicely-paced, the instructors possess neither too much nor too little ""pep,"" and you can truly customize your workout to meet your exact needs - and then change it up as much as you want for variety! I've even continued to do the arm and leg workouts, with modifications, while pregnant - because I love it so much! (I have even, in some of my more hormonal moments, suggested to my husband that we name our baby ""Minna"" if it's a girl!)",1192406400,,537,4.434343434343434

Quick Fix is easy to follow, fast & has good instruction.  What I don't like, is that theres little warming up or cooling down.  Also these are mainly for toning up,  I use this along with my other exercises.  Ive done quite a few workout tapes and Quick Fix is one of my favorites.",1189555200,,420,4.1234567901234565
1424258,5,B00005BIG4,"I have tried many different videos and workout routines (walking, gym, etc), but this is the one I've used consistently for a long time.  I am not a morning person, but the 10 minute segments make it easy to wake up just a LITTLE earlier and get 1 or 2 in before I have to get my kids up for school.  Throughout the rest of the day I do 1 or 2 more when I can - during nap time, waiting for the pasta water to boil for dinner, etc.  I can't spend 30-60 minutes at one time to workout on most days, so this has been a great way to get a good workout in throughout the day AND see noticeable results.",1186617600,2,598,3.845528455284553
1424259,3,B00005BIG4,"I'm a high impact kinda gal, so I got bored.  The pace is steady but I like mixing it up between challenging and motivational exercises.

One day in my mother's place I found this video and I decided to give it a try, this is totally different, everyday I choose a mix of exercises depending on my mood, and I know if I decide to do 10 or 30mins I will get a good workout, I always feel good after doing these exercises. I started to see the difference in a couple of days, and now after 3 months doing them 5x a week my body have really changed, I know its a question of consistency but also finding the right motivator, this solution makes me want to do the exercises. Now I want to get pregnant and I am looking for the same 10 mins workout mix solution, I hope I don't get dissapointed with the prenatal from Nancy Popp, at least the reviews are good.",1178409600,,856,4.071005917159764

1424262,4,B00005BIG4,"This is a great workout in itself, but I usually use it for 10-20 min of toning after cardio. The video has three different sections it focuses on (abs, butt, and arms and legs). And then each section has three different workouts. You can mix and match up to three sections to play in a row. The workouts are all good. And the only equipment you need is a set of dumbbells and a chair. The only reason I gave it four stars is that they get really chatty and after the first time it gets annoying. I usually turn the sound off on the DVD and play music instead.",1175558400,4,560,4.1

The movements may seem easy at first, however if you really concentrate on the muscle groups you are working, you will feel that encouraging burn.  I don't think this will take the place of my regular strength training, however I don't feel guilty cutting a run short because of the weather, when I can come inside and hang out with Minna, Julie, and Nancy for however long I choose.

Its very short and It's not so tough that I find myself avoiding it.

Recently I bought this DVD after reading its great reviews. I am a follower! This is the best exercise DVD I have ever bought and I use it ALL the time. It's so fun! It's challening for someone that exercises regularly, but not so difficult that I feel I don't want to do it even on a blah day. It is just long enough and not too long that even having a 2 year old and working full time I am able to do it everyday and even look forward to the next day! I recommend this for everyone- even those who don't enjoy exercising and don't do it often, this may just change your attitude!",1171843200,2,723,4.134751773049645
1424272,5,B00005BIG4,"I have been a runner for years yet I wanted to get a video to focus on my abs, that is when I first bought the QuickFix abs VHS. It was great to have 3 different 10 mins workouts to rotate through the week and it was a good workout, even my husband does the ab workouts.  Then I decided to pump up my tush, so I bough the QuickFix Buns VHS, this one I needed to make a little more difficult than what they do so I wear 10 lbs ankle weights.  The movements are not fast so it is ok to wear the weights.  My husband loved how this video helped my rear.  Then I stumbled upon this DVD which had my two videos, plus the leg and arms portion so I had to buy it.  I love it!  I love being able to create a quick workout from the custom menu that I can do after my run and you can see the results!  I also like it when I travel because it is not always easy to workout.  I can pop this into my laptop and pick a 30 min. workout from the custom menu and bam I get a bit of a workout on the road.  For the arms when I travel, you should use weights, but who wants to pack weights in their suitcase, I just use water bottles from the minibar and they are enough to help.  Overall, as an advanced workout person, I love this DVD to add a little variety to my daily runs!  I have also continued to use the leg and buns portion throughout my pregnancy and it has been great!  You won't be disappointed if you use it as a supplement!",1168387200,3,1419,3.8054607508532423
1424273,5,B00005BIG4,For those that are crunched for time this product is excellent. The ability to create your own workout out of the available 10 minute segments makes this one of my favorite DVD's to workout to.,1168214400,,193,4.542857142857143
1424274,5,B00005BIG4,"This is my favorite toning workout and I'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of everything? You can do that, too.

The instructors are all good - clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video.

This was one of my best purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by, although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle groups.",1163289600,,914,4.277456647398844
1424275,5,B00005BIG4,"I love the quickfix workouts.  They are only 10 minutes each, so if you are in a hurry or just want to squeeze something in these videos are perfect.  There are nine videos (3 abs, 3 buns, one arms, one legs, and one legs and arms).  You can do them individually or select up to three to run back to back, which gives a good, fast 30-minute workout.  The great thing about these workouts is that after you do them for a while you will remember them without the video!  It's nice when you want to watch TV, but feel guilty because you need to workout.  The hosts are not annoying, which is also nice.",1162512000,,599,4.165217391304348
1424276,4,B00005BIG4,"First and foremost, I must say the previous reviewer is correct in that this consists of two (2) dvds and does not feature the blender that most Quick Fix Total Mix users are accustomed to seeing.

That said, I love this set of dvd's with the space saving of having two discs in one box. I love the workouts particularly the kickboxing segments with Janis. She is an awesome instructor, not too chatty or cutesy. Her cueing is well done and I love the ability to first concentrate on the movement, learning at half-time and then performing the action at regular speed. It certainly aids in learning form quickly and correctly. I have done Tae-Bo in the past but his cueing and counting left much to be desired. The upper, lower and core segments afford you the opportunity to pick your poison for the day or do all three workouts with or without the bonus workout. As a person with a full-time job and a full course load, I appreciate being able to get in 10-40 minutes of work, whatever I choose, prior to getting on with my day. It is a mood and energy booster. The cardio hip-hop is fun but usually done on days when I don't feel like exerting myself much by punching and kicking. Don't think you won't sweat b/c you will, it's just a nice change of pace.

All in all I really like this set but that's because I did not own them individually prior to now. I did have to take away a star for the misleading title and description on the box. Yes it rankles a bit that it is billed as a Total Mix, when it is, in fact, not one but if you don't already have one or the other discs individually get the set and pass the single on to someome else.

*** Update: May 1, 2007
I am pleased to report that Quick Fix has repaired the 'two' dvd issue. I picked up the set, again, last night hoping they repaired the problem and yeah, they have. A friend will be lucky enough to inherit the two dvd's and I will be using the blender option regularly. As an aside you don't have to only use the blender option with this one you can play both segments separately as well. Yeah Quick Fix.",1161216000,10,2074,4.245569620253165

Read some of the other reviews to get an in depth feel for the video/DVD.  I recommend this for anyone wanting to really target their abs and butt/legs.  It only has two segments for arms and they are mediocre, I thought.  But I love being able to choose 10 minute segments.  I always start by telling myself I'll just do one and inevitably I do two or three.  I don't think I'll get bored with this one, since it has so many variables.

Since we've heard the ladies' chatter so much we don't like it anymore, but that doesn't stop us from following the instructions and using the dvd.

On the back cover it states that this DVD has a ""blender"" feature in which you can mix and match 3 of the 8 10 minute workouts all on one DVD.  However, the copy I just bought, there is no such thing.  Instead, kickboxing was on one dvd and hip hop was on a separte DVD, and with this there was no such thing as a ""blender"" to mix and match these workouts, because they were on two totally separte discs.  Has anyone else run into this problem when purchasing this workout DVD?  Maybe I just happened to get a ""bad"" one in the bunch.

You can pick the workouts and the order you do them in and that makes it never boring.  I highly recommend it and I even like the young ladies in this DVD.

The dvd is completely programmable so you can choose which order you workout in, whether you feel like the arms, butt or ab one first.  Within these three segments, there are three, ten minute routines and each time it gets a little more challenging.  There is a little count down timer in the corner to let you know that your time will be up soon and sometimes that's really helpful when you think you can't go on anymore, you only have a little bit to go.  It keeps you motivated to progress a little more each time you do these exercises.

While this isn't the most difficult workout out there, it's great to do when you are pushed for time, tired or getting started because again, it's easy enough, but you can still get results.  I like this a lot.",1145836800,2,948,4.322033898305085

If you haven't experienced the Quickfix system, it's a pleasant surprise. Each 10-minute session displays a clock that counts down the minutes - a reassuring little motivation to help you through the workout.

While I wouldn't use this DVD as my primary workout video, it's an fairly pleasant supplement. The three attractive exercise teachers at times seem to border on salacious, and their conversations grow a bit tedious. The excercises are effective, interesting and seem grounded in exercise physiology. The music is appealing.",1127865600,4,761,4.9375

1424301,5,B00005BIG4,"I love this video!  There are 3- 10 minute workouts for each focus area: abs, buns, and arms & legs (So 9 total 10 minute segments).  Each 10  minute workout really gets in there and works that area!  The workouts are easy to follow, effective, and challenging.  This video allows you to customize your work out- you can custom program up to 3 combinations of work outs.  Usually I pick one 10 minute from each area so that I work each area- but there's nothing stopping you from doing 30 minutes of one area, like buns, if you're so inclined.

I particularly love that each 10 minute segment gives you a well-rounded workout.  So that if you don't have much time, you can do a 10 minute workout that's effective.  Or you can combine a few minutes with your cardio workout routine.

I buy a good number of videos- this is definitely a must have.  It's a great addition to any collection or as a first video. This is a staple in my collection

If you are at all considering this video, my recommendation to you is, buy it!  I think you will be very, very satisfied.

An absolute great buy for my fitness DVD collection.",1122336000,,520,4.364583333333333
1424306,5,B00005BIG4,"Minna, Julie, and Nancy are my friends.  Not really, but they cheer me on and keep me motivated.  This workout is especially great because it is very flexible.  I like to do different body parts on different days and some days I just DO NOT want to do abs.  This dvd lets you choose nine different ten minute segments in any order, up to three per routine.  The weight exercises (legs/arms, legs, and arms) are my favorites.  Weight training is great for women because weight-bearing exercises are critical for building and maintaining bone density.  You don't have to beef out, either.  I use one set of 1.5 lb weights for days when I just don't think I've got much in me and I use three pound weights when I'm feeling more energetic.  Doesn't sound like much, but I want bone density, not bulging muscles.  Anyways, the ability to create a routine that tones the body parts I want to work on is the best feature of the dvd.

If you're wanting to get ready for swimsuit season, or if you're wanting to tone up for that striptease dvd you just bought, try this:  do cardio (carmen elctra's striptease disc 2, for instance, or jane fonda's old stuff) five days a week (for about 45 minutes a day, mind).  Then do weight-lifting for three days a week.  I actually do the weights for five days, but less will be effective as well.

Muscle mass burns calories more efficiently than fatty mass.  That basically means that even when you're doing nothing, those nice, well-trained muscles keep burning calories.  Not really fair, is it?

This is a great dvd.  For some reason, the market for aerobics, weight-training, etc., is very large, but the number of products out there that are any good is very small.  TotalMix is awesome, motivating, and broken into ten minute segments if you're like me and stressed out with no time to spare and kids who try to crawl under you while you're doing crunches.

I wish there were more than one option for the arms, but I can't complain because this is a great deal to get 9 segments on one DVD.  It gives you the flexibility of squeezing in 10 minutes on a busy day, matching a segment with a cardio workout, or just doing a whole workout of toning.  A few of the exercises are pretty easy and you have to focus on squeezing the muscle to get a burn, but some of them are also very challenging and the arm/legs combo especially gets the heart rate up.

This takes 30 minutes and the results are fantastic.

I had a baby a year ago and this had been the best for helping dropping that ""baby weight"".  My other workouts didn't do it as well as this one.  I really like the instructors.  They are enthusiastic and make you want to keep going.  They aren't obnoxious like some other instructors.  I also love the variety in these workouts.  You get three choices per target area.

The DVD has 3 ab workouts, 3 buns workouts and 3 arm/leg workouts. You can mix and match, do as much as you want, and the best part is they are all only 10 minutes each. EVERYBODY has 10 minutes somewhere in the day! Even doing 3 workouts in a row didn't seem like 30 minutes--it went by so fast! But if I need to spread them out I can. I like the style and presentation of the women, too. They're not overly perky or annoying, at least not to me.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:

1. They really need to stretch more before the workouts. Even if they did a 2-minute stretch before each workout, and THEN started the clock counting down 10 minutes, that would be great. Stretching is so critical, especially when you're working with weights. So I end up doing a lot of my own stretching before and after.

2. There are really only 2 arm workouts instead of 3, because the second arm/leg workout is just legs. They should have had 3 arm workouts, then added a legs segment with 3 workouts for just legs. It would have given the user that much more flexibility and choice.

I'm not slamming it though, it's a very good workout and I definitely feel it when I'm done. You don't have to do the same exact thing everyday so it keeps boredom away (hey, that rhymed!) There is no cardio though, so if you're looking for a good sweat, this isn't the DVD you should buy. If you want quick workouts with variety and targeting specific areas, this is a good one!",1093651200,11,1633,4.275080906148867

There are not enough repetitions of each excercise and they just seem totally useless.  There also is not much explaining or warm up, so some of the ab and bun excersices could cause some back problems.  The dialogue is much too cutesy.  I would suggest Tamilee Webb's ""I Want That Body"" instead.  You can do hers in 15 minute segments and you will see results.  They are more difficult, but at least you're not wasting your time and risking injuring yourself!",1092787200,17,621,4.590909090909091

Each segment is 10 minutes long and the DVD gives you 3 sets on 10 minute workouts for abs, buns, arms/legs.

There are nine 10-minute segments that you can mix and match to work on whatever area you're into that day.  This is the reason it never gets too boring. If I'm sick of one ab segment, I'll use one of the other two and still get great results.  I also like how you can work out for as much time as you have.  Since you create the workout each day, you can go for 20 minutes (and still have a good workout) or go for a total body workout for an hour!  I would recommend this video over any other out there at this time!  I have Tamilee Webb's I Want that Body and I did not feel that her workout was as much of a total body workout.

They do this by combining several muscle groups in to one movement, like bicep curls combined with lunges.  But also by alternating movements to double the effectiveness, like squat/abduction/squat/abduction.  It is very challenging, and in my opinion it is something to work up to, perhaps not for begninners.  My only gripe is that the mix option allows a max of 3 sections in a row, where as I would prefer to work up to doing 4 or 5.

1424330,5,B00005BIG4,"I bought this DVD a few months ago based on the reviews I read here at the Amazon site - all saying what a great toning/spot exercise DVD this was. Well, I'm happy to say the reviewers were right!
Now, if you are looking for an overall body workout that includes cardio, this isn't the DVD for you. But, if you are like me and use other tapes or DVD's for the cardio aspect of your workout but also want to get in some toning and spot work after the fact, buy this DVD! The wonderful thing about it is that you are able to choose between 9 different workout segments, program from one to three segments at a time and mix and match them daily so that no two workout days are alike. I really love this option because there are days where I've already worked my buns and legs to death but haven't done much in the way of abs and arms. No problem - I just put in this DVD and choose one of the three ab 10 minute ab workouts and the 10 minute arm/upper body workout and the problem is solved. Also, the nice thing about each of the 9 segments is that there's a little countdown clock in the lower corner of your TV screen that lets you know where you are at in the segment and how much longer you have to push yourself before you're done. I like this because some days I just want to be done with my workout and that little clock works as a psychological motivator to tell me ""it's almost over... only 3 minutes to go...""
The instructors on this DVD are really good as well - so much so that I've become a fan of Minna Lessig and have bought both her Balanced Blend workout and her Emergency Workout and haven't been disappointed with either and highly recommend them both as well. The only additional item you'll need for this DVD is a set of hand weights for the arm and arm/leg segment and then... get ready for a great spot/toning workout!

I already have tons of aerobics tapes at home (since I rarely have time to go to the gym), and I was worried that I wasn't getting enough weight training/toning in.  So I came across TotalMix on Amazon, and figured that the mix 'n match aspect was exactly what I might need.  I was right!
I tried it this morning for the first time (10 minutes of abs, then 10 minutes of arms), and it gave a whole new dimension to my workout (I popped one of my 30 minute aerobics tapes in afterwards).  So now if I do strictly aerobics, I can then do 10 or 20 minutes of TotalMix abs, arms, butt or whatever, to get my toning in. Or heck, maybe a day of 30 minutes all abs...you get the picture, LOL.  If you feel one of the segments is kind of short (like the Arms Blaster, perhaps) and you still have some time--just run the segment again (that's what I love about DVDs).",1054598400,,930,4.144444444444445
1424335,5,B00005BIG4,"This is the best toning workout that I have tried.  The fact that you can choose which segments to do and how many, make it a very versatile workout.  I like to use one of the glutes or legs segments as a warm up before running, and then I do an abs segment afterwards.
The abs segments are difficult enough that I can still feel them even after repeating them for a few weeks.  Each segment has completely different exercises that work all of the major abdominal muscle groups.  The instructor explains the exercises well enough that I could do them all easily the first time through, but not so extensively that I get bored sitting through the instructions when repeating the workouts.  The middle section has some positions that I find awkward, but not too difficult. Cycling through the three workouts keeps me from getting bored.
The glutes and legs segments are great for warming up the legs, and they are good for toning as well.  I didn't find them that difficult, but I could still feel the results.  One of the glutes segments is done on the floor with a combination of pelvic tilts and dog style leg lifts.  The arms segment is too short for weight training, but it's good for beginners, and the arms and legs combo starts to get my heart rate up.
Because each segment is so short, I find it hard to make excuses not to get a quick abs workout in before going to bed.  I generally use theses workouts as a supplement to rather than in place of aerobic exercise.",1050624000,2,1472,4.442379182156134

All, I can say is that I have never been so excited about doing a workout like I have with this one, NO JOKE.  I am telling you the 10 minutes that each segment has goes by so fast it's unbelievable.

1424339,5,B00005BIG4,"I've already reviewed this workout DVD once (about a year ago), and I just feel the need to chime in with another glowing review of it.  Through the winter months, it has been so difficult to get out and exercise outdoors, and I have a 16 month old, so it isn't an option if you have a little one to take along with you for a jog or a stroll.  The Quick Fix Total Mix is the answer to your prayers if you're wanting to stay active and toned without leaving your living room.  I've worked up to doing 5 30-minute workouts a week, and I feel a major difference.  The more you do the workouts, the easier they become, and once you're used to the routines, the workouts will be over before you even realize it because they go so quickly and smoothly.  This is a great DVD, too, because you can custom-make your own workout to fit your particular needs, time-wise and body-wise, and it allows you to mix the workouts up so you don't get tired of doing the same thing over and over again.  I was afraid that I'd get burned out or bored by these workouts, but I haven't, and I've been doing them consistently for months!  When we had a break in our cold weather and I could make it outdoors for a jog, I noticed that I'm in way better shape than before the holidays thanks to these great workouts.

1424341,5,B00005BIG4,"I have been using this DVD for about a year now, and I really enjoy it.  The instructors each teach three sections on their specialties, and they are very knowledgable without being annoying or too perky like instuctors in similar videos.
You can mix and match sections 10 minutes in length, and if you do all three in a certain area (there are three increasingly difficult sections on abs, for example), you WILL feel a difference.
The instruction in each section is very easy to follow, even for beginners, and repeating the sections day after day does not become monotonous like with some workouts.
The only suggestions I would make are that the music is a little boring, it is mostly just a beat and could use some spicing up.  Also, the disk I recieved, from when I first used it, has one section where the action skips a bit.  It isn't enough to ruin the workout, but gets annoying, so I just don't do that 10 minutes.",1042070400,6,924,4.488095238095238

On mornings when I can't drag myself out of bed early enough and in evenings when I'm too tired to make it to the gym I just pop in this DVD at home and can pick whichever segments I wish to do (customize my own workout). The best part is, if all I want to do is 10 minutes of abs in the morning before a shower, this gets me to do it. If I'm feeling more like a half hour, I can do 10 minutes of arms, 10 of legs, and 10 of abs. I highly recommend this DVD for those who are time crunched and can't easily make it to the gym and/or have trouble motivating themselves at home to make up a workout (like myself). The instructors in this DVD go at a medium pace and give a great workout to anyone because none of the moves are complicated but they still get you to work! (By the way there's a time counter in each segment to show you how many minutes are left in it and I've never seen this feature on any other exercise video - it really helps me when I'm rushed for time.)",1039046400,25,1043,3.9014084507042255

1424345,3,B00005BIG4,"I was disappointed with the abs workout.  The instructor spends more time talking and explaining the exercises, than we actually spend doing them.  As a result, you are barely warmed up before its over.
Another problem is that the video is not very informative.  If you want to know the names of the moves you are doing and why they are beneficial, you are in trouble.
Most of the chatter is not very educational.  There's a lot of ""great job"" ""Thanks"" and so forth.  Unfortunately, there isn't an option to turn off the chatter :-(
The work outs (except for abs) are great for quickies.  This video should be used to suppliment something a little more challenging.  Don't except body sculpting transformations here.  Use only on those days when you know your schedule will be tight and you want to squeeze in a work out.
A great body sculpting video is:

1424347,5,B00005BIG4,"I rarely find exercise fun.  I usually think of it as a tolerated necessity that I endure as long and often as I can.  QuickFix is a life-saver for people like me.
The DVD is very well-chaptered, allowing you to choose among nine 10-minute workouts:  three abs workouts, three buns workouts, one legs/arms, one legs, and one arms.  The Customize function lets you pick one to three of these nine workouts in any order.  It's quick and easy to add more after your first three have finished, if you want.  I regularly schedule myself for three, and find I've done four or five before I realize it.
The workouts, themselves, are varied and interesting.  The count-down timer is great, and the instructors (whom you'll recognize from other DVDs) are entertaining and give good instruction.  I'd call myself an intermediate exerciser (long-time FIRM user), and I can't do all three of any one type of exercise -- that is, all three abs or all three buns.  It's even challenging to do buns followed by legs, since they're similar exercises in each.  I'd like more arm and chest work, although I suppose heavier weights could be used to make up the deficiency.
One drawback to these workouts is there isn't really any cool-down and virtually no stretching.  They make the point that ""flexibility is as important as strength"", but that's pretty much it.  It's easy enough to add some stretching afterwards, though, so it's not that big a deal.
Overall, I highly recommend this DVD for those who crave variety, as well as for anyone who likes the option of doing 10 minutes of exercise, or more as time allows.",1032652800,85,1601,4.719424460431655

Every movement is explained very clearly and the moving tempo is moderate (in Firm workout, sometimes it is really hard for me to keep up the moving speed for over 40 mins). Because the tempo is not too fast, I felt like to do another workout after each 10 mins and didn't notice that I probably already did 3 workouts. The counting clock keeps me motivated.
This is not a heavy workout tape, so don't be afraid to try it.
But if you are looking for really intense workout, you should try the Firm workout vedios.

The workout segments themselves are great. I used it for the first time last night and did one ab session and one bun session. I'm really feeling it this morning, and I workout almost everyday. The moves are very different than your typical sit ups, crunches, etc. but are not hard to follow. The instructors are motivating but not annoying. I'm definitely going to keep my eyes open for more Quick Fix DVDs, I think I'll try their Yoga/Pilates DVD next.",1023321600,,657,4.43801652892562
1424355,5,B00005BIG4,"I've been doing one or 2 of the 10 minute segments daily for about 3 weeks, and I already notice a difference!  Love the abs workout, great instructor, and no neck strain!!  The buns instructor is a little grating, so I skip that section most of the time. The legs workout is a toughie, and only to be used sparingly until you build up some strength.  In all, a very versatile program, do as much or as little as you're comfortable with!",1023321600,,437,4.304878048780488
1424356,4,B00005BIG4,"This dvd is great if you need to breakup your workout into little bits. I am home with a baby and sometimes she won't let me finish an entire workout so this is really good because you can just do 10, 20 or 30 minutes at a time. Not much on here cardio wise but a really good tone up type of workout.",1022716800,2,300,3.7777777777777777
1424357,5,B00005BIG4,"WOW!! Not only is the 10 minute option a workout lifesaver...  After doing one of the 10 minute workouts, my abs we're feeling it INTO the next day! This is the FIRST workout I have been able to stick to, I do it almost every day! Combined with a bit of a change in my eating habits, it has helped me lose 30lbs! I am 20 lbs away from my goal thanks mostly to this workout! I love how quick the 10 minutes segments go by and how fun it can be. I do 20-30 minutesalmost every day..some days I only have time for 10 but even the 10 minutes workout is wonderful! If you use the blender to mix up your workouts (I only use this option) then it breaks up your time better...you won't feel like you've just spent 10 minutes doing ab workouts! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has had a hard time getting into a workout routine in the past OR someone who loves a great workout!",1022025600,10,875,4.057803468208093
1424358,5,B00005BIG4,"The whole DVD is great. These three ladies work your muscles hard. The DVD is a little testy and tricky to work at first. It's a little difficult going from the main menu.
There aren't very many of the workouts that use weights.
They focus on alot of isometric moves and resistence. The butt and leg workouts make you BURN!!!",1021852800,,325,4.433333333333334
1424359,5,B00005BIG4,"All the exercises are broken into ten minute segments so there's NO excuse not to do it on a daily basis. Even on my laziest day, I can dedicate ten minutes of my time. Then once I get going, I feel the burn and easily end up doing 30-60 minutes total.
The arm and leg combo segment (with weights) is a great cardio as well.
My husband is mad about my firmer [rear]. Need I say more?",1021248000,2,383,3.987012987012987

1424361,5,B00005BIG4,"This is a great DVD to do when you don't have that much time to spare.  The workouts are 10 minutes long so you can fit them in anytime!  There are 9 different workout and you can program up to 3 different ones in a row.  I love programming what I feel like working that day, I can do arms and buns one day, all abs the next, legs, abs and buns another day.  There are a lot of possibilities!  The exercises are really affective and you'll feel it even after only 10 minutes.",1016323200,8,475,4.01063829787234
1424362,5,B00005BIG4,"I bought Minna's Strength and Grace and Fat Eliminator workouts last year and still do them almost every week.  I was excited when I found another Minna workout.  This is an excellent toning workout.  It gives much more varied movements from your traditional squats, lunges, and crunches (which are also on here too)  The moves are new and fun to do.  There is a clock in the bottom of the screen that is so inspirational.  You wouldn't believe how much more you can do when you know it is almost over!  Also, the workouts are broken down into 10 minute sections so it can be fit into any schedule because you can do one or all nine at a time in any combination.  If you are buying this just for Minna, don't.  She only leads in one section of the DVD, but the other instructors are good too.  This is strictly a toning exercise, so if that's what you're looking for, I highly recommend it.",1011312000,28,890,4.33939393939394
1424363,4,B00005BIG4,"I purchased this DVD after I had my daughter and started it when she was about 3 1/2 months old, and it was just the motivation I needed! The DVD is perfect in that you can choose from several 10 minute segments (mix arms, abs, buns or legs) and tailor your own workout. This was great because I could make up my own workout while she was napping. I'd recommend purchasing this DVD to alternate with a more intense cardio workout.

A person chooses whatever combination of the workouts she wants so there is no reason to become bored by repetition.  All 3 of the ladies leading the routines is an expert in her own right, so you know you are getting quality workouts.

I loved the different levels and never felt guilty when I could only spare 10 minutes in fact many times just 10 turned into a total. So happy I found this again!,1484611200,,397,4.102564102564102
