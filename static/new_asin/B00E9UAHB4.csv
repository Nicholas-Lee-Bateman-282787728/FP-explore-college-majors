8631981,5,B00E9UAHB4,"A beautiful film set in Mongolia which tells a story about a traditional family's response to their camel who has rejected its baby.  In the process it also records the lifestyle of the family, and the community in its efforts to maintain tradition whilst coping with modernity.  I loved this film when I first saw it long ago and would recommend it as a World film and docudrama.",1459296000,,380,4.573529411764706
