5469994,4,B00AQAZZ40,"The Bay (Barry Levinson, 2012)

Barry Levinson's interesting ideas about camerawork in the first couple of seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street set many of the conventions for what we now know as the shakycam/found-footage subgenre of horror film. They were divisive back then, as well; a lot of folks (including every significant other I have had since 1994) find the crazy jump cuts and odd, inappropriate close-ups annoying. But for the rest of us, it made those old Homicide episodes more immediate, more you-were-thereish in a way nothing else could. I wasn't alone in this; after The Blair Witch Project in 1999, shakycam took off as a subgenre, and Richard Belzer's Homicide character, John Munch, lives on on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. So at least Dick Wolf and Eduardo S&aacute;nchez agreed with me.

And now Levinson, in the first sci-fi film of his career, turns his attention for the first time to the genre he effectively owns, but has never claimed ownership of. When it comes right down to it, Levinson, who directed his first feature film thirty years ago, has more experience behind a camera than anyone else who's ever directed a shakycam mockumentary combined. And it shows. I grant you, horror--the feeling of your guts being stirred with a stick-style horror--is an intensely personal thing, and no harm no foul if your mileage varies on this one. But if Levinson's infection mechanism here is the kind of thing that squicks you out, this movie is going to do more to keep you out of the ocean than Jaws AND all its interminable sequels.

The movie is offered as, basically, a commentary track over found footage. The commentary is being delivered by Donna Thompson (Boy Wonder's Kether Donohue), who at the time of the events presented was a college student doing an internship for a local TV station. She'd been assigned to cover the July 4 festivities in the lovely (and fictional) little town of Claridge, MD, and was the only person there in a media capacity--who still covered July 4 festivities in 2009 unless they were unpaid college interns, right? But something went very, very wrong in Claridge, and by July 5, the government had confiscated every piece of film and DV, shut down every website that dealt with the contributing factors to the incident, etc. Now a rogue website (think wikileaks here) has leaked it all, and has asked Thompson to fill in some of the blanks.

It doesn't sound all that interesting, and it certainly doesn't sound scary. But I can't get into the details without going all spoilery on you, and I'm not going to do that, even if the trailer does; I may have already said too much in the second paragraph. (I apologize to those I talked about this movie to before I actually saw it--I didn't realize how spoilery the trailer was and went around calling it ""Barry Levinson's Killer ________ Movie"" for months after seeing the first trailer.) But even if I can't talk about the mode of infection, I can certainly tell you about the aftereffects, which involve a hospital full of screaming, dying people, and, well, you know what happens to dying people when time passes. Levinson, being the effective bastard that he is, also throws in a crude-but-way-too-effective technique: giving us footage from some out-of-towners who are headed for Claridge to meet up with the wife's parents and see the fireworks. This is blatant emotional manipulation, but it's so well-executed that I didn't care one bit.

I will also note for the record that one shot during the climax provided me (and a lot of other people in a sold-out 450-seat theater) the first time I jumped in a cinema seat and yelped aloud since my high school days. All those reaction shots you see in ""indie"" trailers for the Paranormal Activity movies? Yeah, I saw that in real life. Crude, but effective.

The Bay opens in selected cities on November 2. It is just as good as Barry Levinson's name on it would lead you to believe. *** ",1351987200,8,3963,4.776642335766423
5469995,2,B00AQAZZ40,"This movie was not what I expected. The people get sick and die...that's it. They don't come back to life. They don't chase thier victims. They just die. From a bug. Really?

I sure hope there is no sequel...then again, the way this filmed ended, there could be one.",1351987200,3,356,4.492307692307692
5469996,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Combined with real world events and a fictional story line, this movie is one of the better ""found footage"" movies.

5469998,2,B00AQAZZ40,"The film had a promising trailer and looked like it would be thrilling but overall it felt contrived and much of it too far fetched.  I think these films are set up with difficulty because their premise is that this is a hodgepodge of actual footage from various sources thrown together to tell a covered up story which leads to many portions which were 'conveniently' captured on film by people with Iphones who apparently had the film rolling for no apparent reason but got lucky and caught some important event.  Additionally, this innocent sleepy little town apparently operated like London with big brother cameras on every street corner.  All in all, I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone, it is regrettable I paid money to see this.",1351900800,8,738,4.841269841269841
5469999,4,B00AQAZZ40,"""The Bay"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes (official website synopsis): Two million fish washed ashore. One thousand blackbirds dropped from the sky. On July 4, 2009 a deadly menace swept through the quaint seaside town of Claridge, Maryland, but the harrowing story of what happened that Independence Day has never been told - until now. The authorities believed they had buried the truth about the tragedy that claimed over 700 human lives. Now, three years later, a reporter has emerged with footage revealing the cover-up and an unimaginable killer: a mysterious parasitic outbreak. Told from the perspective of those who were there and saw what happened, The Bay unfolds over 24 hours though people's iPhones, Androids, 911 calls, webcams, and whatever else could be used to document the nightmare in Claridge.

The cast led by Will Rogers (as Alex) & Kristen Connolly (as Stephanie) is pretty good. The directing by Barry Levinson (also produced & co-wrote the story) is pretty good. The story by Levinson & Michael Wallach & the screenplay by Wallach is pretty good.

The music by Marcelo Zarvos is pretty good. The cinematography by Josh Nussbaum is pretty good. The film editing by Aaron Yanes is pretty good. The casting by Ellen Chenoweth & Tracy Kilpatrick is pretty good. The production design by Lee Bonner is pretty good. The art direction by Stan Flint is pretty good. The set decoration by Glenn Peison, set dressings by Imee Cuison & Jordan Foster is pretty good. The costume design by Emmie Holmes is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Walter Kiesling is pretty good. The visual effects by Hydraulx, coordinated by Eric A. Kohler is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Cal Johnson is pretty good.

This is a different and interesting type of eco-thriller / horror movie that is pretty good and well-made (also well-crafted). It also does a terrific job of using found footage, as well, in an interesting documentary feel. This is definitely a different (and interesting) type of genre for director Barry Levinson, who is, of course, well known for directing movies as ""Diner"", ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", ""Rain Man"", ""Bugsy"", ""Sleepers"" & most recently, the TV movie ""You Don't Know Jack"". This is also another pretty good movie from the producers of ""Paranormal Activity"" & ""Insidious"". This is also one of the best thrillers of the year.",1351900800,,2381,4.992443324937028
5470000,2,B00AQAZZ40,"Shaky cam alert... If you don't like shaky cam then this movie isn't for you. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it through this movie so I really don't know how good or bad it is. :-(",1351900800,2,180,4.171428571428572
5470001,4,B00AQAZZ40,"The Bay is a found-footage/documentary-style horror film. It follows a story of an epidemic in the Chesapeake Bay; it is told as a documentary and in narrated by a news reporter who originally covered the story; other characters' stories are also told including a doctor, a few cops, and a family visiting for the 4th of July festivities. It's a very well made film.

The film's story is disturbing and creepy; although it's not exactly a disease in the movie (you'll find out what it truly is later in the film), the film effectively uses the disease/epidemic concept. Imagine being eaten from the inside by an unknown disease without any medial help or help from the government; it truly is terrifying, especially if you're afraid of disease or sickness. It has some very unique scares, including the theme and jump scares, and some generic found-footage scene, but it's balanced very well. The special effects were also great and shocking, fans of gorefests may enjoy it; we see faces being mutilated, body parts being amputated, etc. The acting was great most of the time, some of the acting was bad and slightly affected the authenticity of the film. It runs at a very fast pace, as well, which is good in my opinion. The ending was great and dark, as well. There aren't many significant flaws in this film.

Overall, I really enjoyed The Bay; it's a well-made horror film that effectively uses its concept to frighten the audience. If you have completely given up on the found-footage style of shooting, then this film may revitalize your faith in the genre. People that are afraid of disease may be frightened the most. I highly recommend a rental.

The Bay has very strong violence and gore. No sex or nudity.",1351900800,4,1717,4.75503355704698
5470002,4,B00AQAZZ40,"The found- footage genre has come to mean boring, quickie exploitation flicks since its breakthrough movie The Blair Witch Project.
This is not one of them.
The Bay is very smartly done, with the timing of the scares and the deeply disturbing implications of the cause of the infection driving the story rather than nude scenes and bad special effects ( the special effects in The Bay are a step above bad but nothing award winning ). And you actually care about some of the characters, which is something you don't find very often in horror films these days.
BTW, the villian in The Bay exists in reality. That part was not made up.",1351900800,2,633,4.56140350877193
5470003,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Barry Levinson, The Academy Award-Winning Director of Rain Man, dips his toes in the horror/sci-fi genre for the first time since the often maligned Sphere... and the result is an absolutely unrelenting approach to the overcrowded found footage/faux doc scene, proving that, when done right, reality can be truly horrifying when fiction is too close for comfort.

With production by the Paranormal Activity/Atrocious team, Levinson's tale of a 2009 parasitic outbreak that devastates a small coastal Maryland town, The Bay is packed with uncompromising realism, utilizing virtually all elements of today's video transmission landscape to craft a compelling storyline of eco-horror, as well as document the often grisly results on the populace.  Rather than the simple hodgepodge of home video clips, The Bay utilizes the back story of a young reporter who, in a Youtube-ish introduction and story arch, facilitates the explanation of the cohesive collection of footage from Iphone Facetime, security cameras, home video, science crew video, government and personal Skype clips, traffic and police camera shots; all spliced together to brilliant effect.  Maximum impact in short spurts; fully cohesive for the ADD crowd.

If you, like I, thought the found footage scene jumped the shark a couple years back, I would say The Bay has resurrected my faith in the approach. Definitely recommended to horror or thriller fans not only for its realism and fresh take on the genre, but moreso for the terrifying prospect that something of this nature doesn't seem too terribly out of reach.  Top shelf all the way, The Bay will make you swear off sushi for life.  Brilliant, clever, horrific and fun, Levinson has crafted a great film in a genre not known for its complexity. Well worth a look...",1351814400,8,1787,5.209059233449477

A news team led by an inexperienced reporter named Donna went to Claridge, Maryland to report on the 4th of July festivities. All seemed to be going well with a crab eating contest, dunk booths, parades, and the like. Then people start to get sick in droves until the majority of the city is infected with a mysterious disease. The Bay is a found footage film that compiles news coverage, personal videos, facetime conversations, surveillance footage, hospital documentation, conversations with the CDC, and oceanographer's video report to create its narrative. Donna in the present (three years after the events of the film) comments over the footage she took along with all the other compiled videos to get the full picture of what happened. It took three years to get this footage out there because it was confiscated by the governement until an anonymous hacker group released it online.

Underneath the prestige and success of the idyllic looking town Claridge is a seedy underbelly of sacrificing the environment for financial benefit. The most lucrative businesses in the town are the chicken industry, restaurants, and tourism. A large chicken farm dumps over 5 million pounds of chicken waste into the bay each year doing untold damage. The water is full of bacteria plus all the pills people take every day which then is desalinate (but not filtered) and given back to the townspeople. Although people have protested the pollution, the drive of the mayor, good old American capitalism, and tradition keep those opposing voices to a minimum.

The real trouble starts when thirty people exhibit extensive boils over large parts of their bodies. Dead people are found disemboweled with tongues missing that are assumed to be murder victims. Things are still generally normal while these people suffer. The mayor condemns any reports of toxic water as fearmongering and stresses personal responsibility for safety. The public call in to a radio show with huge amounts of outlandish theories from biological warfare to vaccines. The makeup effects make the rashes and boils look absolutely disgusting and lend a sinister tinge to all the lighthearted celebrations of the town and its use of water. It's crazy, but realistic to see how so much can go wrong without any real response or effort to protect people. As the film goes on, more and more people get sick with increasingly terrible symptoms.

The film follows a few people intermittently through the story which include the oceanographers studying the polluted water, a teenage girl facetiming at the local ER, the doctor in the ER, Donna the reporter, the mayor of the town, cops patrolling the neighborhood, and an oblivious couple with their baby coming to visit family. Donna is the main person connecting all this together, but I found her annoying especially when she cared more about her naivete showing in the video over the devastation. My favorite was the doctor in the ER who worked with the CDC to find out the cause of the outbreak. He works tirelessly interviewing, treating, and operating on people plus giving all the information to the CDC despite the people's growing panic and pain in the ER plus the risk of infection for himself. He prompts a girl facetiming with her friend to record what is happening in order to garner more evidence.

The culprit turns out to be a mutated type of parasitic isopod paired with a bacterial infection. The natural type of these parasites target fish, get in through the gills, remove the tongue, and then replace it with their bodies. Other than that, it doesn't do any other harm besides sometimes causing them to be underweight. These mutated ones attack humans, fill their stomachs with larva, burst out of their bodies, and remove and replace their tongues. This is the perfect movie to watch for the 4th of July considering the current political climate. Those in power are actively shutting down the EPA and other restrictions that protect wildlife and the environment in favor of businesses, drilling, and jobs in defunct energy sources. This film is frightening because it shows an extreme version of what could happen if we refuse to take a good look at what is being done to the environment. The only flaw of the film is the annoying reporter Donna and the terrible CGI effects, usually with fast-moving isopods. The Bay takes a water creature feature similar to Jaws and adds an additional aspect that makes all of the water, not just the ocean, dangerous.",1499817600,4,4498,4.960212201591512

5470119,5,B00AQAZZ40,"I like horror movies.  Usually, I can't suspend my disbelief and they come off more comic or corny than anything else.  The Bay, on the other hand, is a really good story.  I've lived in the region off and on over the last 20 years, so I know MD, Tidewater VA, and the Intercoastal Waterway a bit.

This film seemed very believable.  Having grown up in the region, it just seemed to hit home for me.  I don't know how a non-local would feel about it.  (Movies taking place in, NY or LA, for instance, don't really matter to me.)  I know from doing some business development research when I lived there that the Chesapeake Bay region draws millions of visitors each year and billions of dollars' worth of business.  You can imagine how a deadly outbreak like this would quickly affect countless people for a long time to come.  Even worse, as the film unfolds, you start to realize there would be practically no way to avoid being infected if you were in the area, yourself.

For me, it was easy to get into The Bay as the story of a cub reporter whose boring 4th of July picnic coverage turns into the most frightening story of the century as the residents of a small town, and nearly everyone in the Chesapeake Bay, is suddenly in danger of dying from parasites in the water.  The fact that she's telling the story as a survivor and using found footage from a wikileaks-style video dump was really cool.  The story has a certain War of the Worlds-style to it, in which the director gets to destroy the Tidewater Region over the course of the film.  I was surprised to learn the director originally intended to do a straight documentary on pollution in The Bay, but was dissuaded by the material already created by the mainstream news media, and opted to scare the crap out of viewers with a ""truthy"" fiction story that might motivate them to support cleaning up the Chesapeake.

(For what it's worth, I met a guy who was involved in MD political circles and once attended a MD govt official's party where politicians explained to him the recycling program in MD was a joke strictly to appease voters and the bay would never be cleaned up because the MD govt is paid by a business interest who could not be named to ignore their polllution.  He also said the fines for polluting the bay are too small to dissuade big business from dumping.)

The premise of the film was very believable.  The way the outbreak developed seemed very realistic, too.  As the nature of the infection became clear, it just got worse and worse.  Also, one of the cool aspects of the movie was how the director didn't necessarily have to show you a hyper-violent blood bath to make the story scary.  The scene with the cops responding to the house, and what happens there, was horrifying, yet the horror of it is only hinted at.  Pretty cool!  (I bet it saved a lot on the budget.)

Obviously nothing like the movie but there was a real event that took place a decade or so ago.  Don't remember the details but you can Google it, think it had something to do with the water and either a lot of fish dying or some kind of outbreak.  Doubt that many people died but I do recall a cover up to a small degree.  Guess that is part of why I love this movie so much.  It's not quite a found footage film as there is very real facts about the water in the Chesapeake. I think of it as my little Sunday night guilty pleasure.

There is a never ending cascade of ""news"" footage and ""interviews"" with scientists, fishermen, victims, business owners and the like, which is edited and compiled in such as way that the viewer's reaction is ""enough already"". Frequent fast forwarding of this film fails to reveal anything more compelling than what was shown in the preceding frames.
The ending is as about exciting as a high school science experiment wherein the solution is to over-chlorinate the bay water.

Amount of film that isn't Skype or Shaky Cam or Daash Cam = maybe 15%

This movie got a one star rating from me for the following reasons:

1. Whoever thought that Skype was a good recording medium deserves to be barred from the movie industry. So much of this movie is filmed in poor quality footage. (Extreme examples of dashcam footage and found-footage but excessively post-production degraded.
2. Anytime they mention the CDC, the footage shown is through a 320p Skype connection. Complete with visual and audio lag and cut out. Exactly how you want to see a film.
3. At no point is a quarintine of any kind enforced even at the hospital.
4. Common sense and physics seem to cease functioning so the movie can throw in a cheap jump scare.
5. Scenes featuring actors talking on the phone are very poorly edited. The dialogue doesn't flow naturally and the actors cut each other off a lot. (I think they had the voice actors phone in their lines or recorded them without the other actor/actress.)
6. At no point does someone in real life with their face covered in blood ask if the blood is off. To those of us who don't know, blood has a very unique texture that is very hard to miss against your facial skin.
7. The amount of bodies/plot points these people miss the first time they pass it surprises me.
8. So many of these ""laptops"" seem to be capable of directional footage.
9. Movie's entire plot is based upon the Department of Homeland Security failing to send a e-mail.
10. Movie explains away the plot by Chlorine bombing the water. (Something that would kill biomes worth of fish.)

I would applaud this film's special effects but I don't think the post production team deserve credit for their ability to doctor less-than-standard definition footage. To me, its a cop out. They didn't want to put real effort into their films so they just made the whole thing on trash footage.

I actually liked the premise behind this movie and the actors did not do a horrid job; however the filming and editing was so poorly done that a lot of the footage was hard to watch or impossible to comprehend.

And, the ecological plight of corporate live stock farming and the damage that is or in the case of the film, could be a reality to the bay.  The Chesapeake Bay has taken quite a beating since Europeans settled here.  It's been used as a dump for centuries and the underwater ecological system has been nearly killed off.  Measures have recently been taken to bring the bay back to life - limiting crab, clam and oyster harvest are only a few of the many.  This film makes a great point in how we affect our environment and how our environment can, if it would choose, fight back.  It's frightening but honest.

Perhaps it was not her accent but his hearing, if they had equipped his character with hearing aids it would have been more plausible.

It's the first ""found footage"" type film I've seen, and it did a really good job of using different sources and different angles to make everything look extremely realistic. I happen to find wiggly, multiple legged, squishy insects completely disgusting and terrifying, and the idea of those things actually INSIDE a person is really revolting. I was able to enjoy the movie without thinking too much about that aspect because if I did I wouldn't be able to get any sleep tonight!!! haha.
Definitely not appropriate for kiddos. There's some swearing but the gore and fear factor is way too high, simply because it's so realistic. Chesapeake Bay contains all of the contaminants, pollution, and ""40% dead zone"" that the movie refers to. Isopods are real, and kill fish exactly the way the movie shows. The ""acting"" if it can be called that doesn't feel like acting at all, thanks to the found footage feel.
The movie takes us to multiple people's perspectives: the Nervous Nellie reporter, the happily married, in-love young couple, the frumpy tween Facetiming her friend all day, the corrupt mayor, the scientifically minded oceanographers, the CDC, etc. etc. All in all, I would say the reporter functions as the main protagonist, and she turns out to be fairly likable.

This film is very clever in that it isn't the traditional ""one person with a camera who is recording long after they should have dropped the equipment and started running"" - it splices together security camera footage, video chats, scientific researchers filming their expert analysis, one family's home recorder, and a novice journalist's first time behind the camera to create a compelling and realistic story that's grounded in believable terror. The special effects are good, the acting is excellent, and there's a message behind the film about the damage we are doing to our ecosystems that's effective without being preachy. It's also genuinely frightening! I strongly recommend this film to any fan of found footage, and the average horror fan, too.",1444694400,12,864,5.313868613138686

5470410,3,B00AQAZZ40,"While the Bay was marketed as a horror film it really isnt.  Its an found footage thriller film about a ecological disaster film that befalls a small Maryland town on the Chesapeake Bay.  The Bay opens with a collection of actual TV news reports from different areas of the country reporting on ecological disasters involving the mass deaths of fish or birds.  The film attempts to tells fictional version of a potential real-life situation based upon facts.

Two marine biologist researchers discover extremely high levels of toxins in a part of the bay and make an even more terrifying discoveryfish are being attacked by a mutated parasite that literally eats them away from the inside.  However the findings by the researchers are ignored by local authorities who do not want to cause a panic with the upcoming 4th of July festival which means big tourist dollars for the small town (insert your Jaws reset here).  Even when the bodies of the researchers are found, the strange bits are (ironic Jaws moment again) are initially blamed on a shark attack.

The holiday festivities go on as planned yet soon nearly the entire town becomes sick. The people begin to breakout with enormous pustules all over their body and vomit blood as hospitals are overrun with patients.  Much of the narrative is told through a young, local TV news intern named Donna who was covering the festival as her first assignment.  The film also makes use of police dash cams, cell phone cameras, security monitors, etc as it relates various side stories in the town such as a young couple travelling by boat to meet their parents at the festival and the chief doctor at the hospital who is trying to get help from the CDC.

The film was directed by Barry Levinson who has been a fixture in Hollywood for 40 years but who isn't exactly known for directing thrillers and it shows.  Levinson doesnt seem to know which aspect of the film to concentrate on and as a result the many different side stories only serve to muck up the events.  As much as I abhor found footage films most tend to stick with one plot or one group of characters.  The scenes involving the CDC especially drag the film down as these experts come off as clueless, slow to respond, and ineffective.  The science is also scattered as it blames everything from excessive chicken poop to nuclear waste dumped into the Chesapeake Bay as a way to explain the mutated parasites.  Despite some glaring weaknesses the actual potential terror that the film suggests is truly terrifying.  While the cast is mostly unknowns they are believable as average people in an extraordinary situation.",1438387200,,2630,4.772626931567329

5470413,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Told through the lenses of multiple television reporter footage, video cameras ranging from surveillance, camcorder and web cam footage there are a host of doomed characters in this film that play out a horrendous scenario in almost too realistic fashion. The story unfolds with an eerie calm and warning much in the way real life tends to play out in the digital age with attention being demanded to certain social flaws, lack of protection for environment, responsible consumerism or proper understanding of consequences of commercialism. Only this film brings the worlds of doom-n-gloomers and human irresponsibility full force into a hellish realization. The story is a cross between environmental disaster and creature feature, yet is 100% nightmare.

The Bay manages to string together a very intense and creepy story by pulling you into the film through a witness of the disaster who managed to survive. A lot of people in this poor town did not! You would think the compiling of so many different types of footage from so many different video sources would be choppy or confusing but in this films case it runs smoothly and allows you not get wrapped into the story almost becoming unaware that it is a found footage styled movie. I felt like I was watching the real terror unfold after the event. Much like I tend to watch those shows that relive the disasters our world lives daily around the globe in order to find warning signs and learn for better preparedness of the future. I was surprised by how invested in this film I became as I sat with my eyes bugged out, holding my breath and cringing at all the gory goodness The Bay offers.

Another great aspect is, that the film reminds me of the glory days when the subgenre of nature run amok  pictures were at it's peak (I still have a soft spot for these films). And, if this wouldn't be enough to watch the film: there is an ecological undercurrent in it, that reminds us (not with a sledge hammer but in a very subtle way) to treat our little blue planet with more respect. My favorite scenes are the ones when the authorities vonverse with each other and nobody feels responsible for anything (it is sad but true and reflects our real life situation - where firms are doing experiments on plants, animals and food and nobody knows what longtime effects these experiments might have on our ecosystem and on oursleves).

A lot of the facts are so absurd, I couldn't even suspend my disbelief. There's no real establishment of any characters that you can care about. There were just so many unexplained aspects to this film: why was there a camera mounted in the corner of a patient exam room at the hospital? Why would a police offer lose his mind and start shooting innocents? Nothing was ever established regarding any mental symptoms. Why would the CDC think that visible larvae would make it through a filtration system designed to remove contaminants? Why is the CDC searching Google and YouTube for answers? How is one doctor performing amputation after amputation all in a few hours?

Bottom line: this movie combines lots of key political topics sure to please. We have some global warming, we have livestock, we have additives in chicken feed, and we have corrupt government agencies that apparently coordinate sometimes and act clueless the next.

5470457,2,B00AQAZZ40,"Oscar-winning director Barry Levinson (Rain Man) tackles found-footage. Not only that; The Bay is co-produced by the Paranormal Activity director Oren Peli. Well, the fact is, Levinsons thriller seems more interested in sending social messages to the viewers than scaring or entertaining them, taking itself a bit too seriously.

Set in a small seaside town in Maryland on Fourth of July, The Bay follows a series of incidents that strongly suggest that the water in and around this peaceful place, including Chesapeake Bay, is contaminated by something. Whatever it is, it is spreading very fast, as the townspeople start to be sick.

While critics mostly praise The Bay (currently holding 77 percent positive reviews), I think most viewers would find the eco-thriller devoid of entertainment value. True, it is often gruesome, but not very scary. Also, while the film clearly aims for realism, some part of the film looks unrealistic, with the CDC staff and doctors at hospitals who are so incompetent.

5470502,5,B00AQAZZ40,"I stumbled onto this movie on Amazon Prime while killing time. Luckily for me it is one of the best Sci-Fi/Horror movies I've seen in a while. It's not perfect but I gave it 5 stars because what is perfect? I'm going to be vague about what happens because I hope you start the movie as clueless as I was. Also, I bothered to write a review, so that says something right there.

Here is what I liked about it:
1) While the premise is refreshing, the movie gives you the classic scares: There are a few startling moments. But the movie doesn't use them as a crutch. It is also not the only scare tactic that The Bay has to offer.

2) It is found-footage done right. The entire movie is shown through various security cameras, web cams, and handhelds. When I watch most of the movies that use this, they come to a point where I want to ask, ""Why won't you put down the camera and help anyone out?"" In Diary of the Dead they even write it in as a symptom of the camera man's trauma from witnessing the zombie apocalypse. The Bay does not depend on one man with a camcorder to keep the narrative flowing. We watch the horror unfold through a variety of feasible communications, as well as a frame-up by a local reporter.

The other advantage to the way the story is filmed is that it doesn't require the cliche group of hot young teenagers. Its not that I'd mind seeing some boobs or watching them get slaughtered. Its having to listen to college rock and crappy dialogue that puts me off in the first 10 minutes of most horror movies. There's very little character development at all, actually. About as much as you'd see in a commercial about laundry detergent. And it totally works.

3) It is Sci Fi/ Horror the way I like it: My idea of a good Sci Fi premise is to take one small, innocuous thing that actually exists, and then crank it to 11. There is a scene where someone does a Google search and it looks like a real Google page. So I went and put in the same search and got similar results. You can Google the horrible things that this movie is about. They are real, just ""cranked to 11"" in The Bay.",1406592000,,2103,4.25

The 'infected' people are ridiculously wooden/zombie-like, and the make-up effects very amateurish.

5470512,2,B00AQAZZ40,"The movie 'The Bay' sounds pretty promising.
I have to admit, I did find the story interesting and the actors were not terrible.
However, you can clearly tell that this movie is made by the makers of Paranormal Activity - and there lies the problem.
It is one thing to use 'video footage' of people that install surveillance cameras in their house to document something, but another thing to try to document an event that affects an entire town. For realism they have a lot of people people with shitty cameras and some half broken video files just to make it look more real.
In my opinion the movie doesn't benefit from blurry, pixely images and skipping 'video files'. It was probably implemented to add some realistic atmosphere to the movie, but at the same times it makes it painful to watch. It is hard to enjoy the movie like that.
And there are some cameras that are shitty that shouldn't be. In fact this movie is from 2012 where even most cellphones had better video quality than some of the 'real footages' that were used creating this movie.",1404259200,,1053,4.576719576719577

5470530,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Not strictly a ""horror"" movie, and not a ""found-footage"" film, although it has some aspects of both.  I'm going to explain what the director was going for and my reaction, and hopefully this will help you decide, if you haven't watched this movie yet.
A couple of the benefits of DVD/Blu-Ray: subtitling and ""special features"".  When these are well-done, you can get a lot more information out of a movie than you do in the theatre or on TV.  Fortunately this DVD has both; therefore I didn't find myself straining to hear what someone was muttering; and in a short ""making-of"", the director Barry Levinson explains exactly what he was doing:

He was approached about doing a documentary--a REAL documentary--about pollution in the Chesapeake Bay.  Researching the possibility, he viewed a ""Frontline"" documentary of exactly that, which he said was quite well-done, and quite disturbing in its findings.  Yet, essentially NOTHING HAPPENED.  He thought: why should I bother re-doing a documentary that's already done?  Perhaps if I fictionalized it, and did a ""what-if"" sort of environmental-horror story, presented you normal-seeming characters with normal lives, and how it impacted them, then maybe people will react more...

The start of the film presents short news clips of unexplained environmental events: millions of dead fish found by fishermen; thousands of dead birds dropping out of the sky, that sort of thing.  Levinson claims all that, and most of the ""facts"" presented in the film, really are ""facts"".  But from that, he extrapolates his fictional story.  It's all told in retrospect by ""Stephanie"" (Kristen Connolly--whom I don't think I'd seen before), who begins by speaking directly into the camera.  She's ""Skyping"" her documentary to another reporter, and we the audience sit in his place, and watch it all unfold.

I very much enjoyed Kristen Connolly as ""Stephanie"".  She delivers her parts with a certain innocence, combined with a deep need to get her story out, which to me sometimes made her a charming and amusing character.  I also was quite impressed with the performance given by the ""ER doctor"", but basically everyone's performance was quite good.

Ninety percent of the movie would not meet most people's definition of ""horror"", though about the last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie would probably qualify.  There's no nudity, little swearing and no unnecessary blood and gore.  I felt It was a thoughtfully done story, along the lines of ""Contagion"", [Contagion meets Jaques Cousteau?] and this will stick with me a lot longer than the majority of the films I view.

Stephanie's own footage (her very first day on the job as a roving reporter for a small-town, sleepy TV station covering July 4th ceremonies) is supplemented by a treasure trove of video taken by others, which is explained by it having been dumped onto a ""gov-leaks"" website [can you say, Wikileaks?]  The premise is that the government gathered all of it up and suppressed it...until someone found it and put it online.  This includes video from all kinds of sources: police car cameras; cellphone videos; outdoor surveillance cameras; video conferencing between an ER doctor and the CDCR, etc...

Levinson explains that for some of this footage, he literally did have the actors and actresses [some of whom had never been in a movie before] ""turned loose"" with an iPhone or whatnot, shoot their part, ad-lib a bit, and re-shoot it as needed.  The resultant video quality is therefore mostly not high-definition, but does feel like a compilation from multiple sources.

That sums up the type of movie it is.  Unexpectedly I found it less like a ""horror"" film and actually, quite engaging, while at the same time reminding us of the environmental problems we produce all around the world, and how eventually they are likely to turn around and bite us harder than we've already been bitten.

It does use a form of the ""found film"" idea along with narrative provided by a female reporter who, as one other reviewer repeatedly notes, seems destined to bust a seam in her drawers.
Baby's got back and plays her roll well.
The effects were passable to downright unsettling when we finally see parasitic isopods ( of various sizes ) inside a living host or scrabbling in the hollowed out remains of other victims.
  The film uses real world concerns about ""dead zones"", a well documented occurrence in oxygen deprived waters, a necrotizing fasciitis-type illness associated with the predatory/parasitic isopods as well as the isopods, themselves which do exist in the ocean but, to my understanding, in deep waters rather than the relatively shallow Chesapeake Bay and whose demeanor is probably more of a bottom feeding existence rather than burrowing into potential, active prey.
  While tension filled and very entertaining, one should not walk into, or away from, this film with any other intention other than being entertained.

This was an unexpected horror-gem from Mr. Levinson.
Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",1392940800,,1250,5.137931034482759
5470539,5,B00AQAZZ40,"I was VERY impressed with the way this movie plays out.  I remember seeing it on the Horror Blogs/sites and not giving it much attention, but the other day, I finally decided to give it a go.  Boy am I glad I did!  The ONLY complaint I have with the movie is Kether Donohue's acting during her video ""outing"" the whole situation.  Her acting during the actual event was REALLY good, but it seems during the one on one footage that she was a little less sure of herself.  I don't know,...I'm no film expert, so maybe I'm thinking too much into it.  Regardless, if you like the ""found footage"" genre, then you simply MUST watch this movie.  If they had put in out into the media as a publicity stunt and ""leaked"" some of the footage, I believe this would have gone out as a massive scare.  It one of those movies that makes you think it's something that could actually happen!  The subject matter is part of the reason why I'm not a fan of swimming in lakes and ponds or any other natural body of water.  You never know what's in there!

The movie begins with Donna (Kether Donohue) making a video to tell the world what actually happened on July 4, 2009 in her small town of Maryland.  The movie follows Donna as she is making her video and playing/discussing the footage that has since surfaced after the whole ordeal.  During the town's Fourth of July festivities, people begin to become ill from what they think is some type of virus.  This leads to chaos erupting amongst the towns citizens and leaders and eventually becomes a matter of national security.

The movie is played out mostly through the newscast that Donna works for.  It's her first time in the field and she's suddenly stumbled into the story of the century.  Throughout the movie, we see clips of homemade footage shot by other locals and town leaders.  The fact that most of it is newsfeed makes it FAR more watchable then most ""found footage"" movies out.  In my opinion, at least.

Everyone needs to watch this movies.  Whether you're a ""horror"" fan or not.  It's just a really interesting movie.",1392595200,4,2068,4.487935656836461
5470540,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Acting was pretty good, the main characters were able to portray non-professionalism into their roles, giving it a home-recording feel at some points, and newbie-reporter fumbling through at others.  The pseudo-documentary style was similar in some respects to ""The Blair Witch Project"" (Myrick, D. & Sanchez, E., 1999), without being over-done.  The storyline was completely believable, including the mistakes by all of the various government agencies that were involved.  Perhaps the mishandling of the event by the various agencies made it even more believable....

This film had been sitting in my watchlist for some time, with me putting off watching it.  Now I'm sorry I denied myself for so long!  It not only kept my attention, but all of the creepy moans got my Collies wound up and turning their heads from one side to the other, trying to figure out where the sounds were coming from - which gave me a good laugh.  That's always a bonus.... I definitely enjoyed the movie and now plan to buy the DVD to add to my growing horror collection.",1392336000,,1050,4.898305084745763
5470541,5,B00AQAZZ40,"I'm so tired of found footage films, and have been sick fo them for quite awhile. I think that was why I passed up on going to see ""The Bay"" when it hit theaters. I like Barry Levinson, but feel that found footage movies kind of make whoever is sitting in the director's chair a secondary matter.

I saw that ""The Bay"" was available on Amazon Streaming free of charge for Prime members, so I decided to give it a spin. 90 minutes later and I've found a new go-to eco-horror movie to show during my next Halloween movie marathon!

The basic story is told from several points of view, Skype conversations between a doctor and the CDC, a young reporter who happens to be onhand to report on 4th of July festivites, two eco scientists investigating high levels of pollution in the bay, police car dashboard cams, and a young girl talking with a friend on her iPhone. The reporter tells how the small the town on the Chesapeake Bay is celebrating the 4th of July holiday. As her story unfolds, the film intercuts scenes of the scientists have discovered alarming amounts of pollution and toxins in the water around the town. Before long the town's residents begin breaking out in blisters, rashes and what appears to be a virus begins sweeping through the town. Conditions worse and what appeared to be a viral outbreak is something much worse.

Found footage movies have become cliche, but a movie like ""The Bay"" really showcases how this style of film can work if done right. Levinson uses the intercut scenes, and various points of view to build suspense and create a mystery as to what happens to the residents in this small town. We get to meet several characters, and as events unfold you can't help but care for these people suffering through this horror.

This is simply a creepy, fun movie. Somewhat gory for a PG-13 movie, but not a gross-out flick by any means. The focus of this film is really on the mystery of what is happening to this small town, and why. Yes, this is an environmental warning film about water pollution and the inept government officials putting budget over citizens, and toss in the greed of big business as well. If you want to view this as a ""message movie"", so be it. I found it a great way to get the action flowing without feeling forced. Highly recommended.",1391990400,2,2292,4.5423728813559325

So he made this one.

Much of what is in this movie is based on his research.

Make up your own mind though, maybe it's all a lie. Maybe he said that to spook us. Either way, I was SPOOKED.",1391126400,,398,4.012658227848101

5470549,3,B00AQAZZ40,"...But not great either.  It is quite creepy, bloody, downright disgusting at times.  But believing all this destruction can arise in just the course of one day stretches credulity just a bit.  The movie tries to overcome that by flashing back to an occurrence a month prior, but to believe that NOTHING at all occurred between that incident and the final catastrophe is not realistic.

Be that as it may, if you don't try to evaluate it in that fashion, the movie has enough tense moments to keep you watching, waiting to see what might happen next.

5470550,3,B00AQAZZ40,"I was stunned to see that this film was made by Barry Levinson, the man behind such movies as DINER, RAIN MAN, GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and THE NATURAL. This just didn't seem like the sort of film he would make. Granted it rises above most films like this but still it just felt odd.

The movie is a combination of found footage and ecological horror film. The town of Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, has something happening to the water supply. Apparently a combination of fertilizer run off combined with radiation and then being dumped into the bay only to have that water become the source of drinking water for the town results in the mishap. What follows is found footage after the government shuts down the town now a location of little more than dead bodies and pollution.

When the movie works it is actually due to the found footage design chosen by Levinson to reveal the story. It's not about select people though there are a few characters that we become enamored of before learning what happens to them. The footage is combinations of home movies, news footage and more that explain what people were going through and how things changed in the town. When added together it makes for a horrifying possible series of events that becomes a tad scary towards the conclusion when the last people to arrive on the docks show up.

The weak parts of the film are the belief that this would happen to this extent and that the government could actually cover up the disappearance of an entire town, especially since this is a summer resort where people from across the country would likely show up. If you can suspend your belief on these two items then you might enjoy this nature gets revenge type film. If you think that this is too extreme and left your ecology flag back in the sixties then you might not enjoy it near as much.",1388448000,,1826,4.560975609756097

The non-scripted characters and slice of Americana from Chesapeake Bay seemed spot on. The story unfolded at an excellent pace, building to a satisfying climax. The horror elements were very well handled and all the more frightening because, for the most part, they appeared like real tragedies happening to real people. (The actors could have done more conveying the pain of their afflictions, but aside from that it was well done.)

I came at this movie cold, without reading or seeing anything about it. At first, I thought I was in store for another zombie flick - but it was deeper and more realistic than that. The culprits of the catastrophe were well imagined and I think anyone who appreciates a good disaster story should give The Bay a fair shot.",1386115200,,865,4.728476821192053

5470574,5,B00AQAZZ40,"i'm not a huge fan of the found footage horror sub-genre.  typically, I find the camera movements nausea-inducing, the more mundane (boring) parts of the footage to be tiresome, and the meaty parts to be too convenient or contrived.  i'm not against their existence by any means, and I greatly appreciate how inexpensively they can be made, and how anyone with a recording device can make one, but they just aint my cup of tea. so it was with a bit of trepidation that I watched barry levinson's the bay.  ultimately, i love the Chesapeake bay, and a respected friend strongly recommended it, so I gave it a shot.

and wow, am I glad I did.  the bay crackles with excitement, suspense, tragedy, and maryland-based realism.  and to its' great strength, the bay is constructed more like a documentary than strictly found footage, enabling tightly controlled camera shots to outweigh any potential shaky-cam orgy.  and when shaky-cam is used, it's that much more effective because it cuts into the calm, frought with tension.  it also allows a broader story to be told, not simply that of one person's home movie, but an entire collection of footage from security cameras, news reports, skypes, text messages, phone messages, first person accounts, and other media.  we see the impact of what is happening via local politicians, residents, children, folks at the CDC, law enforcement, biologists, and medical professionals. it really allows the bay to take on a macro look at what begins as a micro event, and just continues growing.

like so many other nature revenge films, the bay chronicles what happens to the life-giving chesapeake when greedy, short-sighted human beings treat her like a toilet, literally, dumping chicken excrement (chicken ""farms""  are all over the delmarva area) into the water.  Combined with various other idiotic, completely real practices, something starts happening to some of the bay's denizens, setting in motion a truly horrific outbreak of  ""you get what you deserve, humans"".  and this is where the bay makes perhaps its' most brilliant move.  while I love creature flicks, the bay is presented in a fairly realistic manner, so whatever rises from the depths had to stay somewhat grounded in reality.  rather than go crazy, the bay simply amplifies an organism slightly, giving rise to something that is merely better and more proficient at what it already does.  But it doesn't come across as science fiction; it comes across as something that could happen (if it isn't already).

The bay is a cautionary tale, an indictment, a whistle blowing, and a first rate horror movie, lovingly made by one of maryland's great artisitic champions, barry levinson.  barry is quite adept at horror, and it is fitting that he return the found footage frenzy back to maryland, where blair witch was spawned.  but it is levinson's love and affection for maryland that really comes through, and, as a Maryland resident and  lover, and an environmentalist myself, I greatly appreciated this.

The bay won't keep me out of the water, but it will serve to remind me, as any good horror movie should, how precious and beautiful life is, and how we cannot take it for granted, and how it must be protected.",1380844800,2,3220,4.946096654275093

In this film, dumping into the Chesapeake Bay has caused a harmless fish parasite to evolve into a human killer. What makes this film unique is the way in which it was shot. The film is shot as a documentary that was posted on a fictional Wikileaks type site, and tells the story of the outbreak in a small Maryland town, on July 4th. The cinematography is made up of everything you'd see at a small town festival, camcorders, cell phone cameras, news footage, police dash-cams, and security cameras. Through a collection of footage from the day, we are told the story of the outbreak by one of the only survivors, who had to let the world know of this tragedy that was covered up by the U.S. government. The different angles and the fact that their really weren't any main characters also make this film unique. The story really isn't much, as it just like a million other horror films. Everything is normal, until people start getting sick, and chaos ensues. It's not the story or even the actors that keep you interested in this film, it's the different pieces put together in documentary form by the narrator, Kether Donohue. Without the narration, it's just a collection of web clips, but there is some interest in finding out what happened to each of the people we see and in seeing them figure out what's going on at the same time that we do. It's not a great story and there aren't any stand out performances, but the film itself is done in such a unique way, that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, The Bay is another way of telling us about the dangers of not caring for our environment, in a story that is severely lacking imagination, but it's worth seeing, simply from a stylistic point of view.",1377734400,,1868,4.529585798816568

5470608,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Of all the horror films about plagues and contagions, this is probably the most realistic one that I have seen.  The general plot is that an outbreak of parasites in a small coastal town in the Chesapeake Bay starts killing people within a period of 24 hours.  The parasites are actually isopods, marine crustaceans, that are exposed to steroids, growth hormones, and nuclear waste flowing into the Bay.  The larva of the isopods undergo accelerated growth and proceed to eat everything they come across.  Almost the entire population of the Bay is infested with these growing larva, and they are essentially eaten from the inside out.  This movie is presented as a series of lost and found video footage; some of it from security cameras, and the rest of personal video recording devices.  They are strung together as a documentary, and narrated by the key survivor of the isopod outbreak, a female journalism student.  This movie comes across quite believable as the acting is spot-on, the dialog is good, and the special effects are good but not overblown.

I must admit this is one truly disturbing movie with a serious dose of grotesque factor throw in and a few screamers on top of it.

I for one am in love with both franchises, and I could not contain my nerdgasm when I heard about this and saw the trailer. The trailer was rife with shock factor, disturbing images and the promise of a nail biting good movie. Upon further digging, I find that Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity) was barely involved, and it was mostly the brain child of *drum roll* Barry Levinson. Okay. He's been a big name in horror since... never. He did Sphere back in 1998, but do you remember how awesome that movie was? Neither do I

This movie is mainly found footage presented in hastily cobbled together security footage, face-times, 911 calls, and home movies. Nearly NONE of the cool parts of the trailer are in the movie. I found that Donna's narration, which was meant to be used to enhance the terror, was distracting. This movie just didn't deliver. There were some enjoyable gross out scenes, but they were pretty badly done. It's no wonder that this movie got vastly overshadowed by Sinister - which was bloody epic. I generally find that found footage movies tread a dangerous path. If they aren't done just right, then they come off as cheesy and poorly made. Barry Levinson should stick to what he does best and stay out of horror.

Lots of creepy moments and a few jump-out-of-your-seat scares are all the more frightening by Levinson's documentary approach to the film. Much of what the film shows--the polluting of the bay, the 40% dead zone, the mass fish kills--is true. The isopods depicted are real, although not quite in the mutated form in the film.

We hear from a news reporter named Donna (Kether Donahue, ""Pitch Perfect""), who tells her story and shows us what happened through footage she shot and found. Director Barry Levinson (""The Natural"", ""Rain Man"", ""Bandits"") tries to make this story work as best he can, but sadly this material is tired and seems all too familiar.

The first 30 minutes aren't too bad as we see the early signs that something is wrong with some of the people in the town, but what is the real cause? Sadly by the time it's revealed the ability to care about the cause or any of the actors in the movie is pretty much gone. I don't fault Levinson for trying a different type of movie compared to his previous work but this is a lot like ""Sphere"", a good idea but pretty lousy execution.

Audiences have become savvy to the tricks of this particular genre and I myself now watch found footage films with a 'hope for the best, expect the worst' attitude. This film however is one of the best films of this genre that I've seen. Some reviewers have found it boring and I can understand that. If you're looking for a film with a lot of jump scares this isn't your film. There is a fair amount of gore especially toward the end but the strength of this movie is in the psychological effect. We live in a world that is being polluted at an ever accelerating pace and while the events of this movie are taken to the extreme, it isn't hard to imagine that the pollutants that find their way into water supplies are having some kind of effect. A good movie will leave an impression on the viewer and for me this film does just that.",1374364800,,919,4.348837209302325
5470660,4,B00AQAZZ40,"The Bay, directed by Barry Levinson, is a ""found-footage"" psychological-horror film surrounding an event that took Chesapeake Bay by surprise, and by terror. When residents of the small Maryland town on Chesapeake Bay are infected by an unknown plague, panic and chaos set in. Told through the narration of a rookie newscaster, the story splits off into multiple characters as they deal with the situation, following two researchers weeks before the event, and even a family who arrives at the bay after the infection hit hours earlier.

While I think the ""found-footage"" sub-genre is rapidly dying and becoming more annoying than interesting, The Bay is a much more thoughtful addition to the genre. The acting, while was not award-winning or phenomenal, was still good and believable. Levinson's directing was superb, not completely over the place but instead carefully shot and edited. The visuals, with what little there was, were perfect; the Isopods were not cheesy but very creepy and realistic. The cinematography was surprisingly great, too, for a ""found-footage"" film. The musical score by Marcelo Zarvos was good and worked very well in the film, helping shape the eerie atmosphere and terror of how quickly the situation got out of hand.

Overall, The Bay is a refreshing thriller that shows us what happens when we screw with Mother Nature. Now, some will try to compare it to M. Night's The Happening, because the plot lines are similar, but The Happening was not as well-written or directed. Think of The Bay as Contagion on a smaller scale and ""found-footage."" This movie, though, is not for everyone, as it is very violent and disturbing.

I think people should quit complaining about the trend of this type of ""found footage"" style... It's a style that has been around a while, but so what?  It's just another way of making a movie, what does it matter if it's another ""found footage"" movie... ? I don't get the complaining.  It's like complaining that another movie has come out that's a western... Yeah... So what?  Wouldn't it sound stupid if every time a new western movie came out people complained about it being another movie that's a western?  So I don't get why people are fed up with found footage movies... Frankly I'm fed up with people whining about it.

The acting is hit and miss in the movie... I think the narrator of the movie and reporter Kether Donahue did a bad job.  I didn't find her acting convincing and the worst part of it was how apathetic she was... It's like she really didn't care... I think she showed little emotion, and not in the traumatized way - just in the bad acting way.  I didn't hear concern or fright or sadness in her tone of voice, and she didn't convey it in her facial expressions.  I think the movie would've really benefited from a better actress.  There were times during the movie where I literally laughed out loud at her bad acting.

But still, the movie was freaky... The soundtrack to the movie especially really added to the tension.

The heavy-handed message here is clumsily couched in what is the latest and most tiring trend in Horror movies. Yes, it's another found footage film. And from a relatively respected director in Barry Levinson, no less.

There was nothing scary here at all. The best you'll get is a few cheap jump scares and a few gross-out moments.

A mysterious epidemic spreads through a small town on the Bay and we see the collapse of city government and how the infection takes down different townspeople.

My only issue was the camera work. I know that since The Blair Witch came on the scene, movie makers have used video camera points of view, usually involving a lot of running, jerky motions, blurred scenes and frozen or broken up footage when the camera is invariably damaged. This movie was made that way with the addition of footage from surveillance cameras, police dashboard cams, video chat... Unfortunately some people, myself included, get raging headaches from all the camera's jerkiness and unfocused scenes. So, it was difficult to make it through the movie.
But other than that, I thought it was a great low budget movie. I love discovering little known movies that surprise me by being better than most of the films that play in theaters. This is one of those movies.",1372809600,,893,4.805194805194805

5470743,4,B00AQAZZ40,"I found The Bay to be an engaging movie; it had some clumsy portions in the exposition mostly due to some of unexplained, unexplored or ignored portions that could have filled in some gaps, The biggest mystery to me was the lack of explanation about how or in what way all the video footage was gathered and collected; it seemed to be rather glossed over.

Overall, it is a good scary story presented in the guise of a documentary style film account. I actually preferred The Bay over the movie Cloverfield. Cloverfield tended to dwell on personalities in a more heavy handed manner, while The Bay relied mostly on unfolding events, character personalities remained as just believable backdrops.

Judging by the some negative reviews, many people just don't like the documentary film style of movies with ""realistic"" footage, shaky camera, candid camera, etc. I never watched the Blair Witch Project and found Cloverfield difficult to watch, but The Bay seems to have hit the right stride and doesn't over do things. For one thing, I never got to the point where I asked my self, ""Why would someone still bother to keep filming when their lives were in danger?"" The Bay tackles that usual weak point rather well by using ""believable"" video gathering techniques throughout the presentation; very little of it relies on a truly terrified person inexplicably filming the events. I give The Bay four out five stars, it keeps your interest by having a believable premise and steady suspense throughout.",1372464000,15,1497,4.936507936507937

That's about it.  There is no plot and there are no characters.

OK, there are a few characters.  Kristen Connolly (""Cabin in the Woods"") plays a reporter who is making a documentary about a disastrous plague that infected a small coastal town in Maryland.  It's her voice you hear doing voiceovers, and she's the one pulling all the different film clips together from material confiscated by the government.  Frank Deal plays Mayor John Stockman, who was told about the toxicity in the bay but refused to do anything (he's pretty much a retread of the mayor in JAWS who wouldn't close the beaches because he was worried about the tourist trade).  Then there are a bunch of characters called ""Victim #1,"" ""Fair Man,"" ""Activist,"" ""Middle Aged Supporter,"" and ""Bob.""  I don't remember any of them individually.  But who cares?

The plot can be summed up as follows:  The water in the bay is toxic because the mayor allowed chicken processing companies to dump their waste into it, which created mutant parasites, which infected the fish, which infected the people, who are now all developing grotesque blisters and lesions and generally going berserk.  We see a couple of so-called ""research scientists"" doing ridiculous experiments like looking inside a fish's mouth with a flashlight (aha! Parasites in there!).  Doctors speak like high school students.  People run around bleeding and screaming and throwing up.  And Kristen Connolly tries to be all serious as she comments on all this like it's really, really happening.

THE BAY is a low budget parody of CONTAGION (which also suffered from too little characterization).

This review is going to be as concise as possible. Though The Bay is an eco film, it is horrific. Then again, most *possible* disasters and tragedies are natural AND terrifying. ""The Bay"" preys upon an OCD sufferer's worst fears: biological contamination, parasitic infection and (nearly) unavoidable exposure to said pathogen. Like most horror films, it is social commentary and has an agenda. Is is gross? Yes. It is gory? Yes. Could it possibly happen? Well, maybe not exactly as depicted, but pandemics do happen. That's the ultimate point of the film. IT's a warning for our society to become more ecologically minded/mindful so that we do not undo ourselves via unimaginable and horrific eco ramifications.

All in all, I find this film to be pretty icky. I have to admit that it did get under my skin; I have no interest in watching it again. Maybe that's a success in Levinson's eyes? Maybe that's his ultimate mission- to frighten us, turn us off and make us ponder. Problem? The Bay, while effective for what it is, feels DATED. Even though green living and ecological issues are hot topics, this movie feels like it was made 10 years too LATE. Maybe it is because of films like Cloverfield, Quarantine, Paranormal Activity, (and the earlier) Blair Witch Project, and etc. etc. etc.....? I don't know. All I know is that the ""found footage device"" (Cannibal Holocaust is the first that I am aware of to use it)  can be effective and unsettling, but like most things, it can also be overused.

And my review title is not completely tongue in cheek. Humanoids is a (very, very) B-movie version of The Bay. Though The Bay may feel like a fresh concept upon its release, it really isn't at all.

Oh, and to those of you who claim to have been sold on the film because of Levinson? Let me remind you that he DID direct ""Sphere."" *shudders* Now, that's a scary film- though not for the right reasons. ;)",1367107200,3,1923,4.660766961651918

5470787,4,B00AQAZZ40,"I can't begin to tell you how much I detest a majority of the ""found footage"" films. Every time I see a new released, my eyes roll into the back of my head and I sigh heavily. The only reason I picked up ""The Bay"" when I saw it was the box and tagline caught my attention. If it wasn't for Director Barry Levinson's name attached to it, I would have put it back. After watching it, I'd say it's definitely one of the better films using the shtick.

In 2009, the town of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland discovers its water is infected. The mayor refuses to admit the seriousness of the situation even as people begin turning up dead and sick. After several more victims die in public, the town goes into a state of fear and closes down. Several eyewitnesses capture the entire incident on camera and cell phones.

I still can't believe a renowned director like Barry Levinson would helm a ""found footage"" movie. The entire concept just seems so below him. It's fairly obvious ""The Bay"" was a pet project for Levinson. He's credited as a co-producer and co-writer of the film. Regardless, he accomplished what he set out to do through adequate pacing and some great stomach-churning scenes, which quite possibly could have some individuals scrambling for a barf bag.

The visual effects for ""The Bay"" are impressive. They might be doctored a little with CGI, but for the most part they look practical. I don't know what they used for the nasty little creatures, but I was convinced they were real. That's how you know you're seeing a good movie. You're pulled into it and are never distracted by bad special effects or acting.

I have to admit that I laughed while watching the credits as they rolled. I saw Oren Peli's name as one of the producers for ""The Bay"" and said to myself, ""Of course."" I've got to hand it to this guy. He's taken an old gimmick and struck gold with it over and over again.

""The Bay"" includes a couple special features. There's audio commentary with Director Barry Levinson. We also get a featurette entitled ""Into the Unknown: Barry Levinson on 'The Bay.'""

I can't deny ""The Bay"" is worth a watch. The concept of the film is very believable. That's what makes it so frightening. You come away from it with this nagging suspicion that what you just saw quite easily could happen.",1366761600,3,2300,4.543478260869565

85% of the film is fact. The location is real, 40% of the bay is dead, the fish population is being affected, and at least at the time of production, the town did not have a functional water filtration system.

5470795,1,B00AQAZZ40,"Uncovered' footage is a technique that attempts to create a realistic element, by promoting the amateur recordings of eye-witnesses, within the storyline (See Cloverfield and The Blairwitch Project). The found footage technique means that we gain various angles of the events, but this prevents the development of characters that we are able to relate to. As the main character narrates the footage, she becomes like an annoying directors commentary, boring and unnecessary for most.

The narrative is built on scientific discoveries, as they piece together what is the cause of the infection. We know the main cause from the beginning of the film, which is found in the water; instead they explore every minor detail, turning this film into a science documentary.

The Bay reminded me of a sedated version of Jaws; cue the obnoxious town committee, the height of the holiday season, and widespread terror, minus the shark and all the gore. The carnage is kept to a minimum, and jump scares are non-existent. This film was poorly marketed as a horror, so please ignore the enticing trailer.

Instead I suggest you wait until the weather warms, and head to your local seaside town, as there are many real life terrors to be seen there.......and for free.

5470814,3,B00AQAZZ40,"My first thought was, ""No, not another movie that pretends to be found footage of real events."" It's been done to death. However, this movie did have a few things going for it that many of those others didn't. Firstly, the acting is surprising good and the characters seem very realistic instead of the same tired clichs. Secondly, this movie employees a different technique than the others. Instead of having the footage supposedly come from one single camera, this is made as a compilation from various sources. News footage, security cameras, personal video cameras and cell phone footage, have supposedly been collected and edited together. This solves one of my pet peeves with the found footage movies, the question about why someone, in the middle of a deadly situation, would continue to film what is going on around them instead of dropping the camera and heading or safety.
The final positive in this movie is that it is not dealing with the supernatural. There is no ghost, no witch, no possessed child, no alien beings attacking New York or Moscow. This is something that could actually happen, a parasite living in the water that eats away at the flesh and organs of people and animals once it has been consumed.  This makes the story more frightening.
You do need to overlook a few things, like the old disaster happening on July 4th weekend, the mayor who does not respond because of the potential loss of revenue for the town  and the not so subtle messages about environmental destruction and the dangers to the environment caused by the meat and poultry industries.",1364774400,,1583,4.837638376383764

Donna ""my pants are too tight"" Thompson (Kether Donohue) is reporting, and not too well, on the July 4th activities in the bay town of Claridge, Md. Everything is fun and games until people start to blister and die.

The film is told as a bad documentary by design. It managed to hold my interest for 45 minutes at which point I started to get bored, even with the material they weren't repeating. The film utilizes real facts about Chesapeake Bay and isopods as well as actual footage of the creatures which you think are fake.

The idea was to draw attention to the problem of the bay because no one watched the Frontline documentary on poisoned waters and even fewer people cared (from director's interview). The problem is that the terror created by isopods didn't come across as terrifying as I found my self concentrating Donohue's tight pants trying to will a button to pop.

I enjoyed the realism more in this film than the ""Paranormal"" series. I also liked the idea of bringing a message to the film. Now if we could take the next step and make it entertaining. This could be done with a witty soundtrack and/or clever dialouge. Maybe having Trey Parker/Matt Stone smoking a joint saying, ""Dudes they're isopods, not Crab People.""

The film moves faster and faster toward nightmare territory in the second half and, if you're someone horrified of viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc., like I am, you will probably be unnerved.  If this type of horror doesn't suit you, you'll probably be bored to tears because it's nothing you haven't seen before.  I think the relentlessness of the outbreak is what really bothered me.  It seems like all characters had to do was be in the general vicinity of other infected people, and they were doomed.  Okay, like I said, nothing you haven't seen before, but well done and, if you like outbreak horror, you'll probably enjoy it.",1363046400,,1024,4.644444444444445

5470835,3,B00AQAZZ40,"I'm generally not a fan of the format but with Barry Levinson at the helm, this is about as good as it gets. A picturesque seaside town gets wiped out by some rapidly-growing organism that's evolved from the crap being dumped in the bay. Short of Al Gore nodding his heading knowingly, this flick is a dire warning of how the life of small town America could get royally hosed by big agricultural corporations who don't care about dropping your little village into a zombie fest.

Our story starts with one of the few survivors (a journalist, oh no) Skyping her confessions to the audience. There's a lot of Skype in this film by the way. We watch the stories of various town citizens unfold on what is fatally their final day just because the evil mayor put steriod-filled chicken doodoo in the water. Damn him. There are legions, boils, blisters and eaten organs along the way and it's cleverly confined to one place to add an extra level of doom. It's very similar to the film Quarantine (or the original Rec) in the way the events are shown through the eyes of a reporter just to make sure we can explore every tragic story in great detail.

Whereas I find most found footage movies distracting for the endless need to explain why there's a camera in the scene, The Bay is handled very well given the limitations of the format. It would probably have been more entertaining as a properly shot movie simply because there's no hallmarks of Levinson but still as an experiment, it's much better than I expected.

The more the doctors investigate the scarier it gets until the whole town is soon infected. This is yet another found footage type movie but it isn't like most of the others. This one is done in more of a interview fashion with the footage being used to help tell the story. Also because of the director (who has done real movies such as Rain Man and The Natural) the movie is technically much better then most of these types. The problem is that even though it flows better and looks better it is still a little boring.

This was bad.. terribly bad. It is the kind of movie where people literally walked away from in the theater.

>>> SPOILERS <<<

This film does not deserve a well thought out review but I will try and give a few examples of why I think of this movie so awful.

Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this is a found footage film. However, the manner in which the footage is tied together is so random that you could die from a seizure in the theater.

The problem of this film is the collection of situations and actions in those situations that make up this movie as a whole. Literally every scene is worth a serious face palm. The film starts with a random (and way to long) low quality introduction of the setting, followed by a first victim of the parasite, and it goes down from there. There are scientists that find weird unexplainable parasites and jump into the water to take a look. There are two befriended police officers that come across a house with screaming people, one goes into the house with his gun drawn, the other stays in the car with his seat belt on. There is an agency that specializes in outbreaks (viral, bacterial.. whatever) and does not seem to give a damn when they hear about the mysterious issue's in the town. There is a supposedly intelligent couple (dentist & lawyer) that walk into a ghost town filled with dead bodies near the end of the film.. with their few months old baby.. and the guy actually thinks what he sees is funny!? The list goes on and on.. 2 hours of this crap

Then there is the science.. like the only other review I could relate with pointed out. The science is made up by a 5 year old. All conclusions that are drawn, numbers that are given, idea's that are thought of.. it is terribly. Just when you hear something that might be vaguely plausible or logical. i.e. the explanation that anomalies could come from pesticides.. nuclear leaks are drawn into the equation to make it sound better or whatever.. Everything about it is pretty pathetic.

The overall story is also weak. I mean, maybe there could be made a half-decent film out of the idea behind the movie.. mutated flesh eating parasites, it sounds pretty cool right?.. but in the context of the rest of the film this story only adds to the train-wreck that is called ""The Bay""

A part of me died while watching this film, I will never get it back, I'm scarred and I seriously want to kick the creator of this movie in the nuts.. or even better.. I want to go back in time and get raped in stead of watching this film.. I mean it.. getting raped is better!",1357171200,,2784,4.3941747572815535

5470882,2,B00AQAZZ40,"(WARNING: Contains spoilers.)

I love the concept of found footage so much I have a high tolerance for weak films in that sub-genre. I've never seen a found footage movie that I didn't like on some level. Until now.

I don't think I'm the first to observe that horror too large isn't really that scary. The Paranormal Activity movies (which I love) are scary because they are so up-close and personal. When a horror movie like The Bay affects hundreds of people, it's not as scary for some reason. That could be a psychologist's PhD dissertation for sure, and not just regarding horror movies.

Back to The Bay: There's just nothing new here. I like the idea of tying in the environment, I know the Chesapeake Bay does have problems with chicken poop run-off, so that realism should add horror, but in the end, it's more like a dry news report or documentary. It's all the same cliches. Government cover-up? Wow. Never seen that before!

I will say that the make-up effects were good - I was grossed out by the boils on people. I kept waiting for there to be something more with the plot, but there wasn't.

Absolutely worst of all, the text in between scenes is how the primary horror was resolved! Imagine if in Star Wars (the original 1977 one, not the crap modern ones) instead of showing the death star blowing up, it switched to text and read, ""Luke blows up the death star!"" The CLIMAX of the movie - and you have to READ it like a silent film! Terrible. Just terrible. They tell us writers to ""Show don't tell"" but I thought with movies you couldn't possibly make that mistake! Looks like I was wrong.

Instead, it plays like a documentary.  Lots of individual bits of footage, spliced-together.  Commentary from somebody who survived the event.  Bits of information pulled from various sources.

On a side note I have never been more happy to not be a meth addict in my life. If I had been tweeking I think I would have scratched my flesh off watching this flick.

And two, despite how much it borrows from other movies (Jaws and Outbreak were on my mind the entire time I was watching), it still manages to be entertaining.  I think the found-footage thing has been way overdone and that it lessened the quality of this movie -- but if not for the found-footage aspect, The Bay wouldn't have a leg to stand on in terms of originality.  I mean, bad things in the water interfering with a lucrative 4th of July celebration and a greedy mayor who's partially responsible?  Ring a bell?  Basically, if you haven't seen Jaws, watch that instead.  If you're a horror movie afficianado, make sure you've seen Cabin in the Woods, in terms of more recent films.

5470934,4,B00AQAZZ40,"When I heard about this movie, it was in passing and I hadn't given it much thought. 'The Bay' as a title didn't give it the oomph needed to really intrigue me; however later, I came upon the trailer. It looked extremely interesting, and I was sad to see that it was in limited release. I am a big horror fan, and a fan of biological horror flicks like ""Contagion"". I am not a huge gore fan (Like the Saw franchise, that's not scary just disgusting).
Let me break down what I thought of the movie into good and bad. I promise I won't spoil anything.
Good:
1) Reality. This movie is not farfetched in the story. It has a believable twist that makes you feel for what's going on to these people. Also as someone with a biology degree, I understood a lot of what was going on, but that doesn't mean you need a degree to understand too. The movie is very good about explaining it in its own way.
2)Most of the characters had good build, and you were curious to see what happened to each one named.
3)Unlike most, I didn't find the video quality to be all that bad. Is it pixelated in portions? Yes. Why? Because this isn't supposed to feel like a normal horror flick where you watch from the outside; this is supposed to be found footage that's pieced together. That made it more believable.
Bad:
1)There is a girl telling most of the story, and I do agree she could have been cut down a bit more.
2)Some portions of the movie were harder to hear due to sound quality (that's how it was supposed to be, but it would have been nice to hear all of it) These are small sections still.

All in all, this is a good movie that puts you on edge. It makes you not want to go in the water nor drink from the faucet ever again. If you liked blair witch project, contagion, movies that go at their own pace and thus build a world that immerses you, this is a flick worth watching.",1353110400,59,1865,4.180555555555555
5470935,4,B00AQAZZ40,"POV is a interesting way to watch a movie.  It has to be done in such a way that is realistic at the same time clear so that the viewer can follow what is going on.  Only a few movies have done this, Coverfield, Quarantine and the Diary of the Dead are the only ones at this point that I would say have done this.

The Bay, did a good job in plot by giving the young woman a reason and explainable method for how she obtained the footage and admitted to editing it so that it made sense.  That was very good and over all the plot was well done.  I think we expected more of a zombie flick or that the bugs would start attacking from the water so in action the film was limited.

It is a worth while POV movie if that is what you want to see.  Cloverfield is more exciting because of the running and ever present threat but the Bay is still able to keep you guessing and build some suspense.  I think people that don't like this movie really just don't like the new POV method of making horror.",1353110400,2,993,4.00507614213198

That being said, I think that probably one of the most terrifying shows on TV is ""The monsters inside me"" or whatever its called on the Animal Planet about parasites. This movie is based off of that fear. There is also a sense of ""don't do that"" fear where you are trying to think of yourselves as the characters and saying you shouldn't do this or that or if only you didn't do that. The Erin Brockovich part of the movie is lacking but it tied the movie together in a way that I think made the lack of production more endearing.

5470943,5,B00AQAZZ40,"If you are a fan of first person horror then you definitly need to check out this movie!

This is an awesome addition to the realm of first person horror.  The Bay has the shakey camera effect along with a monologue by the protagonist and additional footage three years after the events in the small town.  The female protagonist does a great job bringing together a set of horrific incidence and trying to make some sense out of them.  We never truly know what caused the ""sea lice"" to explode on the scene, but it is enough to know everything is documented and we get to go along for the ride.

I'm a huge fan of this type of horror, because it seems so much more real.  Spoiler.  The best part I liked was when the girl circled the fountain and found the mutilated man.  I screamed when he blinked his eyes.

I'm happy to see this type of film done so well.  Every few years a new one is produced and it can be hit or miss.  Quarantine is my top pick for first person horror, as a camera crew follows a fire company into a apartment building and everything is caught on film.  Quarantine is an American version of the Spanish Rec.  Both movies have the same plotline for the horror, but differing origins.

Movie beyond sea beasties and the plague, there is The Diary of the Dead running in Romero universe.  This is certainly a good attempt to do first person horror, but besides a few witty remarks it falls flat.

Of course there is the original first person horror movie The Blair Witch.  Love it or hate it, this film started a sub sub genre that I really enjoy.

Again if you like a full on shakey camera effect or some documentary information this is a horror film that will definitly entertainmen with an appreciable amount of gore and paranoia.",1352505600,4,1756,4.367283950617284

It's not.  There's no plot or payoff here.  There's no story or character development.  There's not even any witty commentary or good dialogue.  It's about a bunch of people, slowly dying.  At the end of the movie, most of them are dead.  There's some Michael Moore type ""investigative reporting"" but it comes off as overhyped and preachy, as there really isn't much point in ""exposing"" the poor water quality of a fictional town, and the horror of atomic radiation creating giant monsters was old in the days of Ant! and Trouma.  It's just weak.

More than that, this seriously doesn't hold any kind of semblance of rationality at all.  The conditions are such at the end of the movie that there is no way a coverup could be successful, especially given that Homeland Security and the CDC aren't known for their skill in coverups.  And the idea of buying the town's silence... it just doesn't wash.

So yeah.  It's not a horrifying movie, it's not plausible, it's not involving and it doesn't have good characters.  It's a bad movie.  It's got a bigger budget than most bad movies, but it's a bad movie.",1352505600,2,1272,4.641255605381166

5470947,3,B00AQAZZ40,". . . restores my faith in horror.  For me- horror as a film genre is one that produces 50 awful movies for every mildly good one.  ""The Bay"" is more than mildly good.  It is a good movie.  I've never been that crazy for horror flicks told in the ""first person"" style- first made popular by the ""Blair Witch Project"".  But ""The Bay"" changed my mind about that.

This is the story of a localized man made environmental catastrophe and pathogen outbreak in a small coastal town on the Chesapeake told documentary internet style by a communications student present at the time of the events.  We, the viewer, are made to feel as if we were watching this film on the internet- granted- a high speed and at times high def internet. It actually manages to mimic the feel of watching an internet production without looking like it. It looks ""real"" but yet it doesn't feel cheap.  This movie had a budget.

The fictional events of this film take place in 2009 and using assembled footage from her own cameras, security cameras, home video cameras, cell phone video, police cruiser video- and other audio and video clips- the female narrator and lead of the story is re-telling it to us on the internet present day as she voices over the events.  She focuses on the experiences of several individuals and groups of people as well as her own experiences.  The result is a tightly told very creepily atmospheric modern day horror story.

This is a film that works.  What makes this a good horror film is that the all too believable and recognizable social atmosphere it portrays is almost more horrible than its belief suspension aspects.  This is also quite a dense film.  There is a lot packed into it- and I think it is worth more than one viewing.  A rare gem from a genre otherwise littered with cow cakes.

Why just the three stars then?  Because- after reading some of the negative reviews I do see how this sort of film might not be everyone's cup of tea visually speaking and how the story unfolds.  It's not really mine either as I avoid first person movie narratives almost entirely myself but I found the spookiness of the themes intriguing in this film.  So only three stars because it is told in a style that seldom works in my experience and I can see why people would get frustrated with it right off the bat.",1352332800,,2314,4.503597122302159
5470948,2,B00AQAZZ40,"The ""found footage"" technique is taking film by storm. Expect more of it. Soon, we'll look at ""regular"" films like we do now at silent films.  And get this.... it's SUPPOSED to be poor quality. Creates a believable and empathetic viewpoint for the viewer. But the science here is a joke. Yes, the fish tongue parasite exists, but everything else is just bunkum. The list is a long one, but I mean, really??? Chicken manure monsters? There is really nothing scary here once all the people have died except dead bodies. And the sick guy jumping out at the end is just LAME!

Did I meantion the truly TERRIBLE acting?! Just imagine M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening, but non existant budget, the worst acting possible, and the phrase ""chicken shit"" said at least 50 times. And the main female lead was not easy on the eyes.

5470953,4,B00AQAZZ40,"Georgetown, SC - More in the water than just fish..... This is what happens when we don't take in consideration what we're doing to the ecosystems around us. The town this movie was made in, that bay is surrounded by 4 major plants within a 10 mile radius - Paper Mill, Steel Mill, Chemical Plant, Power Plant, not to mention other various plants and mills using the water of the bay and the canals. Seems harmless right, nothing bad could come out of all those plants using the water and recycling it right back into the bay and the town. Whats scary is this could have really happened and the people who watch this movie and think its a crappy B-rated combo. Bottle Water! Don't Swim in it if ya can't see what's in it!

5470956,5,B00AQAZZ40,"Wow...
I understand that there are different tastes in movies but IMHO this has deserved more than one, two or three stars.
IF you are interested in marine life/government coverups/human-caused mess-ups resulting in mutations then look no further! The story telling is suspenseful, the main character(s) are/is realistic and the effects are nice (not too much CG). With little gore, this movie keeps the viewer in a permanent ""what-would-I-do"" and
""what-happenes-next"" atmosphere.
I loved it and i think 3.99$ is better spent here than on your next visit to a fast food chain or pack of ciggs that makes you sick.
hope that helped a bit and enjoy",1352073600,5,646,4.9907407407407405
5470957,5,B00AQAZZ40,"I wasn't expecting much fro The Bay, since there are now so many ""found footage/cover up"" tapes turning up. I'm glad I took a chance and watched it, it was very well filmed and edited. They used footage from a wide swath of media, iPhone footage, security camera, tv footage, family videos, and reporter on the ground. It's all fully narrated which is nice and again very well edited. The pacing starts off quickly, which is usually my problem with found footage films, they take a long time to get to the action. This movie almost drops you quickly into the action and it's good. Give it a chance and you may be surprised.....Thanks",1352073600,7,633,4.56140350877193

But I really like how they took recent probably forgotten news footage and weaved it into a semi horror story. And it's one of those ""I wonder if that could happen?"" stories.

In my recent viewing I'd put this up there with V/H/S because of the story.",1351987200,3,423,4.48051948051948
8556316,1,B00AQAZZ40,This type of movie (found footage/shaky cam) has been so overdone in the past few years that it renders even interesting topics boring. Just one gory death after another.

8556319,3,B00AQAZZ40,"This movie was obviously made by people freshly indoctrinated just out of an American college. All the ideas were so cliched it was like barf. Greedy Americans contaminating local waters which caused a massive bacterial outbreak ironically on the 4th July. Idiot American citizens call in the local radio station making the usual idiotic American claims of terrorism and satanic cults. It was like some film student was charged up on their newly found anti-Americanism and so eager to express it that they spewed it out in an uncontrollable stream. It was the exact opposite of the great found footage film ""The Blair Witch Project"" whose genius, in my opinion, was the authenticity of the characters. They were believable and familiar, which is crucial to a found footage film. The true irony of ""The Bay"" is that the movie itself is based on wild conspiracy theories, which the movie, ironically makes fun of. In modern America you are much more likely to hear conspiracy theories about Russia, water contamination, Israel and Christians than you are terrorism or satanic cults. If you look around the world in the last decade, where are you going to find water contamination due to human causes? It certainly won't be in the US. What's way more scary than a fictional movie is when all young people go into college as vibrant individuals and come out of it thinking, talking and acting exactly the same.",1524873600,,1406,4.887029288702929
8556320,3,B00AQAZZ40,"Hollywood big-shot Barry Levinson tries his hand at reality horror with disappointing results. He says he saw a documentary about the effects of pollution in the Tidewater area. It didn't receive wide distribution, so to improve awareness about the impact of pollution on this part of the MD and VA coast, Levinson made his own fake documentary based on the factual documentary.

Like most newcomers to the horror genre, Levinson doesn't understand the difference between scary and gross. This movie is gross in the extreme. It features small creatures called isopods--which in this movie look, scamper, and bite like giant cockroaches. They eat human flesh, burrow into human flesh, and often bore thru their victims' stomachs, eyes, and throats.

Another amateurish mistake is to show police officers getting so overwhelmed by events that they shoot others and themselves, usually in the head. The point is to illustrate that the political state has created situations it can no longer contain. George Romero was better at this sort of thing. Levinson seems more like a Johnny-Come-Lately to the horror genre.

And of course--going back to the gross theme--we have people wandering around public areas like parks and neighborhoods bleeding from every possible orifice moaning ""Help me, help me, HELP ME! AGGHHH!""

I could go on--there are many other horror clichs woefully misdeployed--but this attempt at reality horror is mediocre and uninspired.

One last note: Levinson's theme is that the right-wing industrial covered up an environmental disaster thru its manipulation of media sources. But isn't it the case that left-wing liberal Levinson has faked an environmental disaster thru manipulation of media sources? Interesting how the whole charge of media manipulation works both ways!",1520726400,,1792,5.385714285714286
