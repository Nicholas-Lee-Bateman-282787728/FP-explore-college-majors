8200032,1,B000RE10NU,"I love Korean Drama but this was the worse i ever seen
so bad i skipped many DVDs to get to the ending
thats how bad this drama is, and so fake, how someone in coma can come back to life normally without any lose of brain function
she was a vegetable
plus how can a husband who drove recklessly, endangered his new bride leave his bride for another women
this is a drama i would not put on my resume if i was an actor in this drama and deny involvement if i was in it
its pretty bad if someone like me who loves K-drama cant watch the entire thing.",1291075200,,548,3.9017857142857144
8200033,5,B000RE10NU,good  drama  but  if  you  like  stories  that  have  a  happy  ending  and  wrap  up  with  a  pretty  big  bow  this  is  not  the  one.  However  it  is a completely  different kind  of  story  and  well  worth  seeing.,1240617600,,222,3.973684210526316
