8229287,5,B000XRNDLS,"Gave this as a christmas gift last year, the quality is no HD with that being said it is exactly how I remember it.
I was afraid about the quality but I was pleased with it.",1293148800,,173,3.8333333333333335
8229288,2,B000XRNDLS,"I'm so glad to have MASK on DVD but I have to admit...this is very likely just a bootleg release. The picture quality is nothing to brag about and the menus and such look like something out of a personal collection.

That being said, there's something great about having MASK available at my fingertips... though I would prefer an official ""real"" release.

I might also add that the DVD I received did not match the artwork seen on this Amazon page.",1233878400,12,449,4.530864197530864

8229290,5,B000XRNDLS,"MASK was a line of toys, cartoons, and comics that showed up in the mid-80's in direct competition with GI Joe and the Transformers. Produced by Kenner, MASK was a combination of both GI Joe and the Transformers, featuring diverse teams of human specialists that piloted transforming vehicles. Some people probably saw this as a blatant rip off of proven ideas and a way to make a quick dollar, but MASK toys were still great. As was the cartoon.

MASK (and their enemies VENOM) were teams of diverse special agents that wore fearsome helmets that endowed them with fantastic abilities - everything from lifting heavy objects to creating holograms to firing mountain-shattering laser beams. The masks/helmets themselves looked like everything from ceremonial tribal concoctions to halloween costumes, and were part of the central theme of the show. The Mask team all drove or piloted normal, every day vehicles that transformed to reveal hi-tech weaponry and abilities. MASK's mortal enemies were an evil team of criminals known as VENOM, who were similarly equipped as their MASK counterparts. Unlike Cobra who were always trying to rule the world, or the Decepticons who were always trying to rule the universe, VENOM's evil schemes usually revolved around stealing ancient treasures - many of which actually existed or do exist today. So a pseudo history lesson was given in many of these episodes. VENOM, and their ruthless leader Miles Mayhem, were basically a greedy bunch of thieves. Which effectively distinguished them from their cartoon competitors. Mayhem was also unusually clever, however his cohorts were definitely not. MASK always showed up to stop them each week, led by billionaire/philanthropist Matt Trakker. The history on MASK and VENOM was always a little hazy, but it was clear the two teams were mirror images of one another, with completely opposite agendas.

While some of the episodes are a little slow in spots, this is still an entertaining and intelligent set of cartoons with many humorous moments and clever plot designs. It remained unreleased on VHS or DVD for many years, even though it used to air on weekdays when I was a kid. I daresay that many of these episodes were more entertaining than the Transformers and GI Joe in my opinion, given the element of mystery in many of the episodes. This is Collection 2 and when combined with Collection 1, it encompasses the entire MASK library - and  includes the race-themed ""Split Seconds"" era.

This set is a little strange. The quality of the episodes themselves is fine as are the DVDs. The packaging is semi-professional - but this isn't a cheap dupe. I'm guessing that it is an import probably from the UK or Canada. I bought this before the entire MASK collection was available from Shout Factory. However that version is probably better packaged and higher quality since it is an officially licensed reproduction. It's also more expensive.",1204243200,9,2929,5.045454545454546
