8377780,3,B002QH4XT4,"This is a wacky movie where the blonde guy from those Blue Demon spy movies Spy Destroyer and Passport to Death keeps hanging out at the local wrestling ring and has to fight robots, ladies in nighties, and a killer plant. He does it all with a guy who dresses up like a bad Batman villain in a full body sock with a cape. The luchador action here is minimal because of it. They make up for it with some super swinging Mexican 60s go go rock. The concert sequences make up for a lot. You don't get Blue Demon but you get to watch a dork gyrate in spastic ways on screen while girls in micro minis and thigh high boots shake what God gave them. I can't call this a great movie even by lucha libre movie standards but it's fun and quick.",1470614400,,735,4.075862068965518

I purchased it more for a trip down memory lane. I watched this film during a matinee back when I was a teenager. A SILLY MIX OF SPIES BEING KILLED BY FURNITURE THROWN ON THEM, WRESTLERS (LUCHADORES), A KILLER ROBOT DRESSED IN A RUBBER SUIT, A MAD SCIENTIST ""MR. X"", GO-GO DANCING WITH PRETTY GIRLS IN MINI-SKIRTS & GO-GO BOOTS AND THE UNFORGETABLE HILARIOUS SCENE WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL & EVIL SILVANA (PLAYED BY THE THEN FAMOUS & SEXY ITALIAN ACTRESS Ms. MAURA MONTI) IS EATEN ALIVE BY A CARNIVOROUS PLANT CALLED ""GROSERA"" (GROSS) - DON'T EXPECT HIGH ART HERE - JUST PLENTY OF LAUGHS & SILLY HUMOR!!!",1300752000,,831,5.5
