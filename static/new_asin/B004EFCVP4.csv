4336898,5,B004EFCVP4,"After doing the Jillian Michaels kettlebell workout, I wasn't sure about whether or not I would like Bob's. Jillian's was good but it isn't one of my favorites. Well, I really enjoyed Cardio Shred. It gave me a good, solid workout that kept my heart rate up. But, it was very easy to follow. It will definitely be part of my regular rotation of workout videos!",1299110400,2,360,4.46969696969697
4336899,5,B004EFCVP4,"I have been working with kettlebells for over 2 years consistently and this is a solid, good, decent workout with the right kettlebell.

I used a 13# kettlebell for more of a cardio effect and it did the job.

Bob's instruction is on point and far better than Jillian's kettlebell workout which from many professional kb instructors was a total train wreck.  Form in using a kettlebell is very important, as you can easily injure yourself.

This workout did have strength moves but was more intensive in the swings, snatch, cleans, clean & press, squats, alternating swings, etc.  These moves are cardio intensive.

I also have Bob's other kettlebell workout which is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Harper-Kettlebell-Sculpted-Body/dp/B004EFCVPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body</a>&nbsp;and it is intended for more strength drills.  The biggest difference is the weight of the kettlebell.  KBs are not any different than dumbbells as in when you need more intensity, power to fatigue you must increase the weight.  For Bob's other workout I used a 22# & 25# for the moves.

For 10.99, this DVD is worth getting.  Kettlebells if used minimum 3x's a week will give you faster results than any other workout on the market.  Guaranteed.

One last thing, this workout as Bob's other is more in a beginning feeling, as I already know the moves, so as he was talking I was working the exercise move, since I know it already.  But for beginners, this is a great workout that you will truly enjoy.",1298592000,21,1567,5.317073170731708
4336900,5,B004EFCVP4,"Since I'm a women's fitness coach, I'm not very much into video training.  However, I wanted to add kettlebells into my own training.  Therefore, I wanted a good video that would show me correct technique.  Though I had been doing kettlebell swings using a 25 pound weight plate, I didn't know much else in the way of other kettlebell exercises.  For my first time using Bob Harper's video, I lightened my weight load tremendously to 10 lbs.  I did this to make sure I wouldn't hurt myself while I was learning the forms of new exercises.  Boy, was I in for a surprise!  Bob really kicked my bootay!  OUCH!  For someone who is very physically fit, I was very surprised that I got such a great workout from a video.  My abs were sore a few hours after the workout, and I woke up the next morning with very sore glutes.  Actually, my glutes were sore for a whole week!  The video starts off slowly with some warmup exercises.  It then moves into kettlebell training exercises quickly.  For rests, Bob has you do jumping jacks and burpees.  No kidding!  Towards the end, you'll get a great isolated abdominal workout before the final cooldown.  The video training is approximately 50 minutes long.  I would highly recommend this video.  For about $10, you won't regret it.  Along with another one or two video's in Bob's kettlebell series, his training gives P90X a run for it's money!  ~Abby Campbell, [...]",1298592000,108,1405,4.607287449392713
4336901,5,B004EFCVP4,"Yes, I love this workout. It's HARD. An achievable, do-able, work-your-way into it sort of hard. You can pace yourself as a beginner, or you can go full out once you get stronger.

Some of the other commentors have said stuff like: boring set and no fakey-smiley faces. So what? Are you here to be entertained, or are you here to work the flab off your chubby behind? I'm here to work, baby. Please, Bob - make more kettlebell DVDs!!!!",1296864000,10,435,4.4375
4336902,5,B004EFCVP4,"Another video with Bob at his best, and I loved it. He warns you at the beginning that it's going to be a tough workout. I like to think I'm pretty tough when it comes to my workouts, so I guffawed and didn't believe him. Sure, Bob. The man wasn't lying. It was a seriously hard workout, I even had to stop and catch my breath a few times and lost my form more than once and had to stop and adjust. I can't imagine that you wouldn't get results from doing this consistently, and it held my attention the entire time. And really, Becky? Becky who? What Becky? I hardly had the time to notice the woman- I was working too hard.",1295568000,10,625,4.0894308943089435
4336903,4,B004EFCVP4,"In my eyes, Bob Harper has always been the perfect trainer. I haven't missed one DVD he has and I've never been let down. Not only does he have an ease on camera that makes you feel as though he is personally encouraging you, he explains each move so that you do it best and do it right...and he motivates.  Because the DVDs he's now putting out without the Biggest Loser title are nothing short of fantastic (really professionally put together with the camera shots, close up to show important form, timers, set, backup trainers in perfect form and in sync etc) I was beyond thrilled to see a kettlebell workout by him.

I've been doing kettlebells for some time now and if you've never tried one, I have to say you are missing out. Unlike many things that enter the market and become a workout fad, this has, instead, blown up in popularity even with professional body builders and it's easy to see why. You use muscles you wouldn't ordinarily use and you have FUN working out with all the swings and moves that feel more like a game than repetitive handweights moving up and down and its been proven that the kettlebell workouts burn more calories in less time and I concur.) Additionally, I use my kettlebell in any other workout where they ask me to hold two weights in one hand. It's simply more comfortable.

That said, as far as a fantastic workout...this will push you and you will quickly see results. While I normally use a 12 lb kettlebell even though I use 2 7-lb. dumbbells when working out, this one really works best for me if I use a lighter kettlebell due to the repetitive reps rather than varying movements.

So here's the thing...I have mixed feelings on this one. Bob is his regular awesome, inspiring, motivating self. However, while all of his other DVDs inspire me to keep going, I didn't feel this one had quite the same energy. In fact, I can't even believe I'm saying it, but sometimes it was boring and I wanted to quit. I think part of the reason is that I felt more as though I was watching Bob in a room training a pretty low-energy female rather than being a part of the action. He still explained all moves flawlessly but he's in a room with only one other person that he is basically training and showing the moves to, and she oddly drains the energy he puts out...pretty much frowning and looking serious the entire time with nary an ounce of energy or smile. It was part way through that I finally realized why all the back-up people in other DVDs smile when they workout, which I'd always thought silly before. It actually REALLY does exude energy through the screen. Because when it's not there, I felt it. She looked bored and unhappy.  And there was no one else to look at. So I kind of felt the same...

...especially because the moves are pretty repetitive when ordinarily he takes you through all different moves that work the same parts just to shake it up...so you get the gain without the boredom. But the first time I did it it felt like, in the first 15 minutes, I was mostly just doing the same things as compared to other kettlebell DVDs. I may not have minded had I not already felt it was not so exciting to watch as compared to his other DVDs and other kettlebell DVDs.

Never in my life would I have thought I'd prefer Jillian's training to his, as much as she offers amazing workouts, she has nervous and silly-tough energy...but her new kettlebell DVD, gulp, I actually liked better. I can't believe I think so.

I don't think what I didn't like is his fault so much as the serious atmosphere in watching him train someone with no enthusiasm.

That said, do I still feel very positive about the workout? I do. This will change your body. You will feel it during the workout and the next day and you will do the moves perfectly with perfect cueing and form. You will learn to use the kettlebell flawlessly and change your body. That is, afterall, what we all wish to achieve with such a purchase in the long run so motivate yourself with some music that inspires you if you, too, feel a lower dose of energy, stick with it, follow Bob's good training...and this is still well worth the purchase.

Would I rename this Kettlebell Strength Shred? For sure. It's far more strength training than cardio. However, it burned great calories for a strength DVD, just like all kettlebell DVDs seem to (I measure my calories burned with a bodybugg so I can compare it not only to other fitness DVDs but also see how much my metabolism increased hours after a strength DVD. Cardio burns more during the workout but while strength training burns less during, it continues to burn hours afterwards and build muscle to also burn more calories even at rest.)

Would I change a few things if I could? Yes. Will I still stick with it and be happy I bought the DVD? Absolutely...I just wanted to give the full picture of my own experience.",1295395200,161,4876,4.4735658042744655
4336904,5,B004EFCVP4,"I really like Bob Harper's workouts.  This one was no exception.  I have been doing kettlebells at home for about 6 months now with other videos.  I was really excited that Bob was putting out kettlebell workouts.  He did not disappoint!  He does a great job teaching the basic kettlebell moves-especially the clean and the press. I think I finally learned how not to bang my wrist.  He breaks down the movements in a really understandable way.  His manner is so encouraging that even when he is pushing you hard, you believe you can do it.  I really like that Bob's subjects (in this case it is Becky) seem to really be struggling along with me to complete the workout.  I can't stand excercise videos that feature smiling excercisers who dont' seem like they are breaking a sweat.  I will say that in my experience, I need to have different weight kettlebells for different exercises.  This could be discouraging for someone who has already shelled out some bucks on one kettlebell.  I will admit, they are not cheap.  But they are worth it.  Make sure to watch the video that comes with your contoured kettlebell.  It will teach you how to modify certain exercises, like the windmill.  In short, I highly recommend this video to anyone who really likes a challenging, sweat-filled workout.  You will feel awesome when you complete it!",1295049600,42,1337,4.7186147186147185

I use the treadmill regularly at the Y, so it was not like it was the first time exercising in a while or anything either.

Your hands should be right at your crotch, the bell hanging at the highest point inside thighs. Here, they are swinging too low, using more of the arms and the back. Bad form. Lorna Kelidman instructs great form, search for her video ""KettleX Swing Tutorial"". Take instruction from a 3 time kettlebell champion.

I am going to purchase a second DVD from a different trainer so I can switch them up.  I like Bob Harper; I think he's done great things for many people, but after watching this DVD I pretty much need to mute the TV and just follow along because he is so pompous in this.  Its almost like he's using the girl Becky as his dog and pony show...he belittles her in my opinion.  Plus he just seems so arrogant.  I did the 60 day Insanity program and Shaun T is such an excellent motivator and is constantly talking to you and he does 85-90% of his workout with his people.  Bob barely does any of this workout.  I like to see my DVD ""trainers"" actually doing most of the workout and being as motivational as possible!

He mixes it up pretty well in the video, but what kills me about Bob is that unlike Jillian, he doesn't like to break a sweat and participate in the exercises. Becky does a great job performing the exercises, but she looks a little frustrated seeing Bob talking and walking around.
Maybe that's why Jillian is more popular than Bob.
I liked the workout, but I would've preferred to have Bob participate, scream and sweat.

4336948,4,B004EFCVP4,"I have tried several of Bob Harper's workouts in the series and he is a tough trainer.  I know if I pick out one of his workouts to do I will be working out, sweating like mad and he won't let me off lightly.  I have done several kettlebell workouts and I found that I really thought this one was well done.  It is just Bob and Becky who demonstrate the moves and I like the fact that she looks like she has to work at it a bit too.  He corrects form and demonstrates proper technique which is must when you are swinging around 5-20+ lbs. of weight. I would not consider this to be a beginner level, so if you would like something that will give you more training, I would seek out a beginners kettlebell workout-Amy Bento has a good one. If you are more intermediate/advanced you will feel like you can take the minimal instruction and just move on with your workout, which will include a 5 minute warm-up, 39 heart pumping minutes of kettlebell, 4 minutes of abs and a 5 minute cool down.  During the workout you will do deadlifts, kettlebell swings, push presses, cleans, modified turkish get-ups, lunges with a pass through the legs and burpees among other exercises.

As a daily exerciser who does a variety of different types of workouts I find the weighted workouts (whether kettlebell or not) tend to be more challenging to me, so I definitely found these to challenge me and now two hours after the workout I have that wiggly leg feeling and can definitely feel my butt got a pretty awesome workout as well as my abs.

Do I love it?  I'll be honest....I love the way it feels when it is done, I love when the credits roll and I am finally finished.  These are probably my least favorite types of workouts, but do they torch calories and tone?  Yes the do, so that is why I will go back to this one again.

Overall, good cuing, excellent form, tough all over workout.",1346457600,2,1875,4.343839541547278
4336949,5,B004EFCVP4,"I ordered this dvd workout video for both my wife and myself. We have another dvd kettlebell workout which we like and still do, but I wanted something that would be a little different and a change. So after scanning the different dvd kettlebell workouts, I decided to purchase this one and I'm glad I did.
My wife and myself really like Bob Harper's kettlebell workout. It's pure non-stop action.

As soon as you turn this on, you're in the workout mode. Bob doesn't let up, it's like watching the energizer bunny, it keeps going and going.

You'll get a great workout, sweating and after this workout, you'll feel better about yourself.

So I definitely have to say that I recommend this dvd kettlebell workout video to anyone who is a fan of kettlebells and wants to up their workout.

For anybody who is not familiar with kettlebells, I most definitely want to say to you, get yourself a set of kettlebells and this dvd and you won't regret it.

Kettlebells to me is better than working out with dumbbells. so if you're into excercising with weights, you should add kettlebells into your exercise routine with a Bob Harper dvd kettlebell video.

4336950,1,B004EFCVP4,"I was very disappointed in this workout DVD.  We are new to kettlebell and expected a full kettlebell routine.  In this DVD, the kettlebell moves are interspersed with pushups, high knees, lunges.  I have tabata and other cardio interval workouts for those moves.  The kettlebell moves are awkward and difficult to incorporate into a smooth routine.

This DVD appears to be poorly produced - done on the cheap.  I think the only reason this DVD sells is because of the name recognition.

I returned this DVD to Amazon.",1341964800,6,518,4.818181818181818
4336951,5,B004EFCVP4,I love this workout. This is a kettlebell dvd to keep in your collection. It lasts about 1 hour and is a good workout. This is well worth the price.,1341792000,,148,3.966666666666667
4336952,3,B004EFCVP4,"I bought this dvd about 6 months ago.  I do this workout every once and a while, I add it to my gym routine.  When I first started doing this dvd I was new to kettlebells.  As I have done more kettlebell classes with kettlebell trained instructors I have learned more about proper technique and form and now have some issues with this dvd.  My biggest issue with this workout is the form used in the dvd.  Bob says he's all about good form but he doesn't execute it in the workout.  You are supposed to pick up your kettlebell in a squat form, as opposed to bending over to pick it up.  This is done to avoid injuries, Bob and Becky never once pick up the kettlebell the proper way!
  They also do not use proper form when completing swings.  They seem to perform their swings by squating and thrusting their kettlebells up with their arms.  The proper way to do a swing is to slightly bend the knees and swing the bell high under you (if that makes sense).  The bell is not supposed to be swung low, it's supposed to be swung high and then you thrust the bell up with your hips, not your arms.
  Another major no-no is that Becky and Bob both suddenly stop the kettlebell when they are done with their swings.  This is a major No-No!  It can hurt your back and you can injure yourself.  You are supposed to descend on your swing and let the swing settle down before you put your kettlebell down, just not set it down right away.
  I gave this dvd the rating that I did because it's not a lost cause.  Bob does use proper form on Pass-thru lunges and Snatches.  Also, when these exercises are done the proper way this is a good workout!  Bob is no joke, he works you out hard the whole time.  I would just utilize other workout dvds besides this one.  Or at least do some research on proper form.",1341100800,4,1796,4.19941348973607
4336953,2,B004EFCVP4,Got this after reading about kettle bells. There is no real instruction on how to use bells. Just a coaching session with no real direction. If you need a motivator - this may be OK. I don't need motivation - just instruction. If you don't know what you are doing- this may not be for you.,1340409600,3,289,4.178571428571429
4336954,3,B004EFCVP4,"I really like Bob and I also think kettlebells are a great workout. I feel like I am burning extra calories through the next day after even a 20 minute session. I would just like to warn people because I think I may have injured myself doing this workout. Maybe it goes without saying that you should work at your own pace, but just be careful when doing snatches with 15 lb kettlebells. I have had shoulder pain for 3 days since trying this video, and I think it comes from a move where you basically fling the kettlebell directly over your head with arm extended. I know how sore muscles feel, and this is more than that.
 I'm still a kettlebell beginner but I would guess that I'm not the only inexperienced person trying this video. I do a lot of different kinds of exercise regularly, so I thought I knew my limits and most of these type of videos I can do without injury: Jillian, Jackie Warner, Tracy Anderson, etc. I guess I trusted that Bob would not cause me to do something that might hurt me without giving a better warning. He does give some warning but maybe they should say for this video you should proceed with caution if you don't have a lot of experience with kettlebells.",1335312000,4,1191,4.364864864864865

Obviously, there are a lot of variables, but here is what I can offer.  As a male, 5'11"", 165 lbs, in decent shape, and a newbie to kettlebell training - a 35 lb kettlebell was too much for me for this workout.  I plan to pick up a 15 lb kettlebell before attempting again.  DVD is hardcore.",1334707200,6,447,4.045454545454546
4336956,1,B004EFCVP4,"OMG! This dvd made me hate Bob! Was he always such a jerk? I thought he was supposed to be the good guy? I don't care for his rude comments tk the girl at all. His constant ""Just listen to me,""and his constant breaks for explanations just drive me crazy! That's why he has another person working with him, so he can explain without stopping the workout. Just horrible. The whole thing seemed like it was thrown together in 5 minutes.",1334102400,8,433,4.3580246913580245
4336957,2,B004EFCVP4,"I have other Bob Harper DVDs, but I really didn't like this one. If you're looking for a solid KETTLEBELL workout (which I was) then you'll need to look elsewhere.

1. Almost 50% of this workout is old-school calisthenics (push-ups, burpees, etc.) and aerobics! This is completely unnecessary for a kettlebell workout, and suggests to me that he either doesn't trust the full cardio benefits of kettlebells by themselves, or doesn't trust that the people who buy this DVD already appreciate the benefits of kettlebells. You do a kettlebell move or two, and then immediately put those down to do something from your eighth-grade gym class.

2. At best, techniques are presented as little pointers. For example, barely 10 minutes in, he's doing high windmills with just a word or two on technique. There's nothing on this DVD to thoroughly demonstrate or explain how to do this move - or any of them - safely and properly. (I guess he's assuming you bought the Bob Harper kettlebell and watched the DVD that comes with that. Since I already own a non-Bob Harper kettlebell, I'd say that's a risky assumption.)

3. There's no rest, not even a few seconds' worth, between kettlebell and calisthenic moves, and for this level of intensity, there SHOULD be. It's very easy to think you're not working as hard as you really are when swinging a kettlebell, and Bob should know better.

4. There's no chapters, no way to skip the 5-minute warm-up if you've already been doing something else, and the only 'extra' is a trailer. There's no suggested workout schedule like on his Biggest Loser DVDs, no section on kettlebell moves and safety, nothing.

All in all, I think Bob should probably stay away from kettlebells - it didn't come off as something he was really strong or knowledgeable in, particularly when there's others who are. I was very disappointed with this one. If I wanted to spend half my workout time on traditional bodyweight exercises in the bootcamp style, I wouldn't have bought what was supposed to be a kettlebell DVD.",1330819200,52,2030,4.82183908045977
4336958,2,B004EFCVP4,"I bought this with a kettlebell to get started. I would have been better off saving the $11 on the DVD, finding an article online (for free) which taught me the exercises, and put on a random documentary while I exercised.

That said, if you like that sort of background while you exercise, this would be perfect for you, but I'd rather watch the History channel or something.",1330300800,,376,4.529411764705882
4336959,4,B004EFCVP4,"This was my ""introduction"" to kettlebell. I bought a 5 pound (yes, I'm a weakling, lol) kettlebell and this DVD along with it. I would say that I'm an 'intermediate' exerciser. I'm mainly a cardio type person. I love step-aerobics, using the eliptical and aerobic videos which get my heart pumpin...I own some weights, but really don't know that MUCH about weight training. I do know that weight training is supposed to be better for you than just boring old cardio.

So I tried this out. I liked it! Now, I will admit there were some moves I didn't do EXACTLY along with the dvd...mainly the ""burpees"" just because I do have knee issues (never had looked at, just get pains in my knees sometimes). So, instead of doing those, I did more push ups. I'd say I completed about 75% of the DVD...again, I liked it and will definitely be using it again! But that's the great thing about working out at home - I used it to my advantage and did the moves that I could and modified what I couldn't. As far as actually USING the kettlebell, though, all of those moves were great! I definitely felt it afterwards!",1330214400,,1102,4.455445544554456
4336960,3,B004EFCVP4,"I feel  this is an effective cardio workout but Bob is bored. I don't find him inspiring at all.  There is one point in the workout where he mocks poor Becky.  ""Maybe  try a kettle bell!  Maybe try a kettlebell!  Who'd have thought?"". I want to bean him with my kettle bell.  The workout is repetitive and not fun.  It is however thorough.  I will rotate this in when I feel like putting up with his smugness.  For enjoyable upbeat Instructors go with Patrick Goudeau, Paul Katami, Jackie Warner.  Bob and Jillian should take lessons from them on how to motivate.",1329436800,2,563,4.475247524752476

4336962,4,B004EFCVP4,"I must say I really liked this workout. I'm new to kettlebell workouts but I did feel that Bob explained the exercises pretty well and tried to emphasize proper form and safety. I read some earlier reviews on Amazon about this video where people were saying that Becky (the girl actually performing the workout) was not enthuiastic and never smiled during the workout. I must say that I think they should have got someone who was in better shape to do the video. Poor Becky was not smiling because she was working so dang hard! I felt bad for her because although Bob kept saying if your form was suffering to put down the weights, or slow down, he made poor Becky keep going (even though her form was suffering horribly!)  Overall though, I thought it was refreshing to see her struggling because I definitely was.  I also thought this was a pretty hard workout (especially with all the burpees).  I also liked the ab workout at the end of the workout. I'd definitely recommend this video.",1329350400,,990,4.581920903954802
4336963,3,B004EFCVP4,"I have to be honest here.  I'm not in love with it.  I like Bob a whole lot and I adore kettlebells, but this DVD was a lukewarm experience for me.  I expected a tough workout from his pic - he looks so ready to rumble there and it is tough!  However, there are a lot of moves that are not involving kettle bells at all.  I liked the pushups, but I didn't buy the DVD set to jog in place, to do be bops or crabs or whatever. Kettle bell moves burn more calories than those.  I felt in a way that Bob had decided he had to jump on the new fitness trend, so he learned a few kettle bell moves and rushed out a DVD.

I also think he should have a tutorial section and not include so much tutorial or form information in the actual workout.  Maybe just reminders as you go along.  One thing that will keep me from doing a DVD more than a few times is if I have to listen to the instructor in depth explain a move again and again.  Once I have it, I just want to do the exercise.  Let's get on with it please, thank you very much.  If I didn't have to listen to him explain things, it would probably cut a good 12 minutes out of the workout.  12 minutes for me to do other stuff.  I may end up returning this one, but I'm going to give it a few more workouts to see how I feel.  If the tutorial stuff ongoing bugs me too much, back it will go!

I'm looking into the Skogg's system, and I heard of another person who designed their own workout just off of stuff from the web. Both seem superior ideas to this.",1328745600,3,1503,3.878688524590164

I wanted a kettle-ball workout that was a little harder than what I got with the set I bought- and Bob delivered.  Even the girl on the video could barely keep up.  My muscles were twitching hours after, and I work out a lot.  This video rocks and is now part of my ""go to for torture"" list.

You want to hate Bob- but something about him makes you laugh while you scream the ""F"" word at him!  Which I did quite a few times!

Since I run my legs are not that sore but everything else is!  I have done this workout twice and will definitely continue with it.  I also ordered his other kettelbell dvd as well as Jillian's.",1325721600,,460,4.170454545454546
4336967,4,B004EFCVP4,"Bob does a great job teaching how to use the kettlebell and perform the various exercises throughout his video.  He also does an excellent job of keeping you moving by making you do high knees, burpees, etc. between sets.  Your heart rate doesn't get a chance to drop.

The workout is very challenging, and I recommend that you have a few different sizes of kettlebells (or dumbbells) available.  For exercises like the squat swing, you can use a heavy weight.  However for some moves and/or towards the end if you're getting tired, you might only be able to complete the exercises if you drop down in weight.  Becky Schaller is Bob's guinea pig (she does all the exercises and Bob instructs her and narrates).  She starts out using a 15 lb kettlebell but towards the end she has to drop to something lighter.  Instead of not being able to complete some of the workout due to the weight being too heavy, just have something else on hand to switch to when needed.  (Dumbbells work well in most cases -- no need to invest in another expensive kettlebell unless you want to.)  And I also recommend that you do choose a weight that will challenge you.  Don't go too light.  I wasn't sure what to do so I started out with a 5 lb dumbbell and let my boyfriend have the 15 lb kettlebell, but 5 lbs wasn't hard so I ended up stealing his kettlebell for most of the workout (while he panted and cursed at Bob for making such a tough workout -- my boyfriend is out of shape and was sore for 3 days!).

My only issue with this workout is that it will get boring to do over and over.  It's about 50 minutes long with the warm-up and cool-down but the routine will get monotonous.  I watched the video once, took notes on the exercises, and did the workout on my own at the gym where I had a wide variety of kettlebells to use.  It is nice to have a good at-home workout option if you're not able to get to the gym, but you won't give your muscles the shock factor if you just doing this over and over.",1325635200,2,1989,4.264
4336968,5,B004EFCVP4,"Kettlebell Weight:
If you're just starting out with kettlebell training and you don't know what size kettlebell to use, the recommended guidelines are that an average woman would start with an 8kg (17.5 lb) bell, while a man would start with a 16kg (35lb) bell. However, this DVD isn't your standard kettlebell workout and it has a lot of cardio and a lot of movement. If you follow those weight guidelines for this DVD, you're going to have a bad day. In the video Bob uses a 20lb bell (the GoFit blue one) and Becky uses a 15lb bell (the red one) and a 10lb bell (the yellow one). There is absolutely no way a man could do this 50 min workout with a 35lb bell. A strong woman could probably do this workout with a 20lb bell, but you wouldn't want to start there.

I use DragonDoor kettlebells, which are largely considered to be the best kettlebells you can get. They are VERY expensive, and once you go below their 12kg bell (26 lbs), they change the handle which results in the bell being harder to swing with two hands. That being said, because you will be using smaller kettlebells than what is considered common, you'll want to find a bell that has a good handle that you can hold onto with both hands and swing between your legs. The GoFit bells actually fit this requirement perfectly and they're less expensive so there's no reason to spend more. As for the vinyl and contoured feature, it's a nice bonus, however, it's not needed if you know good form. The only thing I see those features doing is that they make bad form more comfortable.  Speaking of form...

Kettlebell Form:
As has been mentioned numerous times, Becky has TERRIBLE form, and you need to remember that this DVD doesn't teach form, it's a workout only. Bob gives some pointers on form, but don't be fooled, there's a lot to learn when it comes to form. You can really injure yourself with kettlebells so it's absolutely vital you learn form somehow. You could hit a 2-4 hour kettlebell class near you, or you can buy a DVD since you're already here on Amazon. Two options are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Kettlebell-Strength-Secret-of-the-Soviet-Supermen/dp/B001DE650Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Kettlebell!

It's a lot of money for a DVD that just teaches form, but if it prevents a week off of work due to injury or a doctors visit, it has paid for itself.

The girl in the video uses a 15 throughout.  That's intense unless you are seasoned.  I work out 6 days a week cardio and weights very consistently.

If you are expecting to get by this DVD with two pushups and a deep breath, you will be frustrated and angered. However, if your goal is to get in shape and lose some weight, this is a very wise purchase. Harper cuts very little slack for the viewer (and even less to the lady exercising in the DVD).

My only (very minor) disappointment is that each part of the exercise is not broken down in the DVD menu. The ""Biggest Loser"" DVD's allow you to select specific areas of the workout. This does not. The DVD menu only provides the option to start the workout. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Just be advised this is not an exercise DVD to get your feet wet, you will be plunged into the deep end.

The workout uses one moderate to medium weight kettlebell in an aerobic manner, meaning that a high number of reps are used.  It includes some full body aerobic movements and a few push-ups matched with opposing back work.

The workout is done like a class, with one young student, Becky. Breaks between sets vary, but it is usually a few seconds and the break time corresponds to the time it takes Mr. Harper to explain the next exercise.

Here's the breakdown.

You know when the person who is demonstrating the moves starts getting visibly tired that this is an advanced, results-oriented workout. The moves are easy but effective, and Bob lets you know what torture he has coming next every step of the way. This DVD literally left me as a puddle on the floor. If you're looking for a tough but easy-to-follow cardio/sculpting workout--this is it!!!",1315699200,,456,4.858974358974359
4336974,4,B004EFCVP4,"I start this review off by saying that Bob Harper truly works you out.  You will receive a serious workout with this dvd.  I began alternating this dvd with elliptical machine usage in mid-July of 2011, and my clothes are already looser.  Based on the fact that I have completed this workout several times now, I have some observations and comments that I would like to make.  I also would like to request recommendations for new workouts at the end of my commentary.

1.  I wish Bob would ""mirror"" your moves.  When he speaks of the ""left"" side and ""right"" side he is speaking based on the placement of his body as opposed to the placement of your body as the person working out at home.  This can be an issue, especially during the times in which you are doing floor work, etc. and your eyes are not on the viewing console.

2. I noticed the first or second time I did the workout that Bob forgets to do the 1st set of cleans and windmills on the other side.  Because of this, I chose to do the move on my left side.  I noticed that I am ""weaker"" as far as muscle strength and muscle tone on my left side, so I figure the more work on that side the better.

3. I agree with another commenter who stated that Bob relies too heavily on kettlebell swings.  I understand what Bob means when he says that ""I've gotta keep your heart rate up"", but there must be other exercises that can accomplish the same goal beside the kettebell swing.  The repeated use of swings is one of the reasons that I am now seeking another two or three kettlebell dvds to purchase to break up the workout monotony.

4. To piggyback on #3, Bob should incorporate more plyometrics into the workout in the place f the kettlebell swings.  The ""burpee"" is a very difficult move, and it will make you sweat.  There are other plyometric moves out there, and hoepfully Bob will incorporate them in his next kettlebell dvd.

5. To piggyback on #4, with the exception of the ""snatch"" move, there is very little demonstration of the moves beforehand.  I.e. the ""burpee""- I had to literally stop moving and watch the ""burpee"" move demonstrated in full before I could perform the move at home.

6. I actually purchased and completed level one of Jillian Michael's ""Shred-It with Weights"" dvd prior to purchasing Bob's dvd, and thank God I did.  Jillian beats Bob by a mile in that she has a tutorial that explains each of the classic kettlebell moves, i.e. focus on throwing the weight with your hip muscles when doing swings, proper turkish getup form, proper snatch form.  Because of Jillian's tutorial, I haven't had a problem with injuries.  The main reason I chose to began doing Bob's dvd is because I needed a full 45 minute or more workout.  Jillian's dvd is split into two approx. 22 minute workouts, and it's just easier to run straight through Bob's dvd. I  wish that Jillian would create a full 45 minute to an hour kettebell workout.

7. God bless Becky- she takes Bob's verbal jabs and stays upbeat and positive.  :)

8. All in all, you WILL get a great workout.  Just make sure you focus on using the proper from to avoid injury.  You may want to pull up a You Tube video, etc on the basic four or five kettlebell moves, i.e. Turkish Getup, Snatch, Swings, etc. before beginning Bob's dvd.

I have looked at the reviews on other kettlebell dvds on Amazon, and it looks like there are a few that people seem to rate highly.  Can a few people who have completed the workouts recommend the top two kettlebell dvds on Amazon for intermediate to advanced kettlebell users?  I am looking for two or three dvds that are $15 or less and have a fun, (verbal abuse free), continuous workout that is at least 45 minutes.

4336976,5,B004EFCVP4,"I got this video and tried it.  It can hang with any of the P90x videos and is more fun, in my opinion, if you like kettlebells.  I would definitely recommend it and you are going to be sore afterwords.",1310947200,,202,4.025
4336977,5,B004EFCVP4,"Let me start by saying that I've never been an avid Biggest Loser watcher, but I've watched a few times and thought I'd be on the side of the contestants wanting Bob for a trainer.  Ironically, this is the first Bob DVD I've ever done although I've done every one of Jillian's.  I like Jillians DVD's (except for yoga, too fast) but I have to say I LOVE this DVD.  Loved it so much I had to get on my computer right after the workout to write a review.  Seriously, my arms are still shaking right now, in a good way.

I'm not a person who says they LOVE any workout.  I'm 34 years old with about 10-15 pounds to lose, and I'm not as in shape as I could be but I'm not in horrible shape either.  I let my gym membership go this year to save money and time (it takes me 20 minutes each way to get to my gym) so I've been trying to get creative and try to stay motivated with workouts at home.  Working out at home as always been very hard for me because I always find reasons not to do it.  So I've been going to the library and using Exercise TV on demand to try new workouts befor I commit to buy any.  I've tried Zumba, Billy Blanks, Jackie Warner, and a bunch more.  I tried Jillian's kettlebell DVD and got so intrigued I wanted to try more kettlebell DVD's.  Kettlebells are so cool, they're actually fun to use.  I looked at a few DVD's on amazon and got Kettlebell Bombshell at the library (thumbs down).  I ended up buying Bob and also Angie Miller's Kettlebell Bootcamp on amazon.  I did Angie's first (thumbs down) and did Bob's today.  Holy cow, I have a new favorite DVD, I can't believe I'm saying this but I can't wait to do it again.

Bob is very motivating, as others have mentioned, without being dorky or annoyingly peppy.  Have you ever watched trainers training someone at the gym to get ideas for workouts?  That's what this DVD is like only Bob talks to you too.  Becky is awesome, whoever casted her was a genius.  She's got this smokin body that motivates you but she genuinely seems like she's being trained by Bob as an ""amateur"" as well.  I'm not sure if this was staged or not, but I don't care.  I know someone else mentioned it, but it was cool to see that she was getting fatigued with me and Bob had to remind her to listen to him and watch her form.  I can't stand when the backup people have their hair down and curled and they're smiley and don't sweat.

Anyway, this is the best kettlebell DVD I've done so far.  It worked me out hard and there were none of those ""oh no, I hate these (whatever moves I hate)"" moments during the workout for me.  I'll try to update in a month or so to see if I'm bored with it by then.",1308960000,2,2653,4.120857699805068
4336978,5,B004EFCVP4,Bob Harper gets your heart rate up in this workout dvd.  His workout dvds are consistently high quality products and am always happy to see when he creates new ones.,1308528000,,165,4.5
4336979,4,B004EFCVP4,"This is my first experience with kettlebells.  I started out with a 7lb bell and only work out with this dvd two times a week.  As was described before, there was a segment that was not repeated on the other arm so I have to stop the dvd and do the reps on my own.  There has been a bit of soreness at the elbow but that is probably poor form on my part as a beginner.  Otherwise I love working with the k-bell and plan to keep using this dvd.",1308441600,,443,3.8351648351648353
4336980,4,B004EFCVP4,"I'm a former group fitness instructor who now, at 45, is a ""skinny fat"" person with a bit of wear and tear on the joints. I'm also a big fan of Bob Harper's videos in general, as he's positive, motivating and gives excellent cueing. As others have pointed out, this is not Bob with the usual BL crew, but just one gal--who is working! I was feeling just like she was, and I agree with another reviewer that it was good to see her ""huffing and puffing"" a bit.

While this video moves quickly through the exercises, it's not too fast that you can't keep up and not so repetetive that it gets boring. Let's face it--there are many videos out there that literally repeat the same 4 exercises into a ""combo"" and then repeat that combo over and over so that you want to jump off a cliff by combo 2/100. This kept my attention and my heart rate up there and I worked up quite a sweat--I was also sore in places I didn't expect to be, which is the beauty of the bell.

One caveat for beginners...you may want to start out without any kettlebell at all so you become familiar with the movements and sequences (Bob is off-count on one set where he does extra on one side and not the other--you can pause to do the other side). I feel like I am in pretty decent-but not good-shape and used a 15 pound kettlebell which I had to put down a couple of times. I also purchased my bells at Marshalls/TJ Maxx for around $7.99 for the 10-pound and $9.99 for the 15-pound. I do have to say that I liked the ones in the video, as they are contoured, which seems more ""forearm friendly"" (you'll know what I mean once you flop a bell onto your arm).

I thought this was a really good total body workout that could be adapted to pretty much any fitness level. If I had one criticism (the only reason for 4, not 5, stars), it's that there isn't a person doing the ""modified"" version of the movements, which is almost always necessary for beginners or people with joint problems (e.g, I don't go into a deep runner stretch because of my knees, but there are ways to still get a good stretch); same goes for some moves that could be tough for people with back problems.",1306886400,6,2142,4.245098039215686
4336981,4,B004EFCVP4,"I think this is the first review on Amazon that I've ever written, despite ordering many workout videos over the last five years or so.  The reason is that this workout is KILLER.  I am a 31-year-old female, 5'8"" size 10, 172 lbs.  I would say in pretty decent shape (but carrying extra weight).  Today I did this workout for the first time and I wore a heart rate monitor that measures caloric expenditure as well.  I burned 451 calories, which I feel is very impressive.  I could not do the whole thing without taking a few short breaks.  I am very glad I purchased this video.

I gave it four stars as opposed to five because Bob actually forgets to do a set of exercises for the left side, after you do the right side.  However, I would not let that deter you from purchasing this video - just pause and catch up.  I think it will be really worth it.  It really works your glutes, too.  I am excited to see the results.

Great job, Bob - thank you!",1305763200,,952,4.193370165745856
4336982,3,B004EFCVP4,"I absolutely love Bob Harper.  With that said, I never thought I would find one of his dvds not so inspiring.  It is a good workout, but I didn't feel pushed to my limits as I did in the first release of the Inside Out Series.  I am sweating but only after I get about half way through, and I just didn't feel my heart rate was up long enough.  I don't usually use my heart rate monitor much any more as I can tell myself how hard I am working.  I am sorry to say I was a little disappointed with this one.",1305676800,4,506,3.826923076923077
4336983,5,B004EFCVP4,"This workout completely kicks my butt!  I expected to hate everything about this...I love dance-inspired exercise, but traditional cardio and strength workouts usually make me want to nap instead.  However, I am sitting on the longest weight loss plateau ever and needed something new to help me really BURN away the calories, and this did not disappoint at all.  I am ON FIRE after I finish this up.  The moves you will do in this workout include:

with kettlebell--
dead lifts
swings
single-arm swings
cleans
snatches
squats and presses
windmills
alternating lunges with kettlebell pass under
wood chops
lunges with wood chops
modified ab twists
modified half teaser
modified Turkish get up

mostly without kettlebell moves--
push-ups
high knees
burpees
lunges
standard ab crunch
crunches with knees up
bicycle crunches--FAST!

I might have forgotten some, but that is the gist of it.  I LOATHE most of those moves.  I also even thought that I hated the new ""dark"" Bob Harper, because he certainly is not the same sweet trainer we met on the first season of Biggest Loser.  However, I found him to be motivating.  What was even more motivating was watching his poor victim--er, demonstrator, Becky--work through these moves and be mildly verbally abused throughout much of the workout.  She is real and unrehearsed, clearly, and she struggles with some moves.  She leaves you out in the dark a few times by doing the completely wrong move...and then Bob chides her for it.  I have no idea why, but I smile every time he makes fun of Becky.  It makes me feel better about myself.  I am both laughing at poor Becky's misfortune and thinking of how he would criticize me if I were the one in the room with him.  Whether Bob is doing this on purpose as some psychological trick, I can't say.  From other reviews, it sounds like most don't really enjoy it.  For whatever reason, it motivates and entertains me, and I get excited to see Bob giving Becky a hard time while I workout.

Note on form and instruction:  As some other reviewers have pointed out, Bob doesn't give you an overly-detailed description of form for every move.  I have one other kettlebell workout that I had done prior to purchasing this--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gaiam-Kettlenetics-Slim-and-Tone-Kit/dp/B001EQW8W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gaiam Kettlenetics Slim and Tone Kit</a>&nbsp;which has a bit more detailed instruction of the basic kettlebell moves.  I had also watched the tutorial DVD provided with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoFit-10-Pound-Yellow-Kettlebell-with-Vinyl-Coating-Training-DVD-and-Exercise-Booklet/dp/B000XLZOGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoFit 10-Pound Yellow Kettlebell with Vinyl Coating, Training DVD and Exercise Booklet</a>&nbsp;prior to this, so I had a grasp of the moves already.  I like the way Michelle Khai describes best form for Kettlenetics, and I think the same can be said here although the weight is higher--most importantly, just think of the bell as an extension of your body and keep it in the rack position to protect your shoulders.  These moves are fluid and rely on momentum and strength, so keep up the momentum!",1305158400,9,3230,5.476767676767677
4336984,4,B004EFCVP4,"I wasn't crazy about the setting of the video, or the way Bob interacts with his one and only client (female, of course).  It isn't an easy workout; which I did like. I had to stop to take a few breathers, and couldn't do everything.  It has been a few years since I've worked with kettlebells, but Bob is pretty good about showing correct form. I do wish there were a few different exercises with the kettleball.  Bob continually has you do 2 arm swings throughout the whole video. I did the video last night, woke up this morning and was a bit stiff.  But as I am writing this, my whole body is sore.  So, if you aren't really fit, or just want to change it up, might be worth a try.",1304380800,,685,4.120300751879699
4336985,4,B004EFCVP4,"This is the first kettlebell workout I've ever done and I think it's a great DVD to introduce you to the moves and get your heart pumping. I've only been using this DVD for the last few weeks or so and have a 10 lb kettlebell. I think for most moves I'd prefer using a 15 lb, like Becky did in the video. And I'd recommend the contoured kind. Mine isn't and the arm can take a beating when learning some of the moves, especially a snatch.

I'm not new to working out but I'm not in excellent shape either. I've been working out 5 to 7 days a week since January and so far have lost around 30 lbs. I bought this dvd to change things up and lose my last 35 lbs or so. This DVD will definitely get you sweating. I'm dripping like a faucet through most of it. But I've always been able to do it clear through without any problems. Bob puts a lot of stress on form and explains how to do the moves properly. This is great if you're new to kettlebells. If you're an advanced kettlebell user, this dvd is probably too slow for you, although you can just start working out while he's explaining moves.

Also, this workout is mostly kettlebell but you also do burpees, high knees, push-ups, and various forms of crunches.",1304380800,3,1212,4.197424892703863
4336986,5,B004EFCVP4,"This is a fantastic workout! I was interested in kettlebells and this DVD was highly recommended so I figured I'd give it a try. I'm so happy I did! The workout is very challenging (I usually workout 5 or 6 days a week and definitely found it difficult). Bob is encouraging but makes you sweat and work hard. The best thing is, I've done the workout only three times and I see a major difference in my body! For me personally, these are much faster results than I've ever gotten from running or lifting weights alone.

I did purchase the Bob Harper contoured kettlebell to go with the DVD and am glad I did because the shape seems to work a lot better with the exercises. I purchased a 15 lb kettlebell for this workout - it was pretty heavy at first and the first time through the dvd I had to put it down a few times. However by the second time I did the video, I could do most of the exercises and am glad I stuck with the 15 lb.

I would definitely recommend this DVD if you are looking to workout hard and get fast results.",1303257600,,1028,4.135

I used it for the first time today and it kicked my backside, and I am not an exercise novice.  I have never used kettlebells before, so I performed the entire DVD with a 5 lb kettlebell.  I had watched the entire DVD before doing the workout.  The lady in the DVD used a 15 lb kettlebell and I could tell she was struggling at points.  In addition, Bob has you doing a lot of reps, so, for me, the 5 lb kettlebell worked fine.  I am really glad I didn't go with the 10 lb like I had originally planned.  Bob does a great job of explaining and demonstrating each exercise before performing it.  He even sweats during the workout.  There is very little rest as this is a cardio workout.  The entire workout is just under an hour including a warm up and short stretching session. I don't have any other DVDs to compare it, too, but I would definitely recommend this DVD if you want to get a great kettlebell and cardio workout.  Make sure you have some water handy because you are going to need it.",1300492800,2,1101,4.2451923076923075

This will give you a good workout, don't get me wrong.  I consider myself an advanced exerciser and it definitely got my heart pumping.  But at no point did I feel like I wasn't sure I could do anymore, which I felt at times with the Cardio Conditioning one.  I think perhaps the CC one is a little more fast paced.  I think the Kettlebell Cardio Shred will have a place in my library, but not as one of my favorite ones so that is why I only gave it 4 stars.",1299628800,3,729,4.246376811594203

8426834,4,B004EFCVP4,"I've been an avid home exerciser for a couple of years now, and I don't get sore anywhere near as often as I did when I started, so I bought some new DVDs to change it up, including this one. I tried it two days ago.

This is the first workout I've done in some time that has every muscle group in my body aching (in a good way).

This is effective for raising my heart rate, and also working every muscle group. Pushups, presses, and lunges are all incorporated, and just when I thought we were about to cool down, Bob adds a little ab workout at the end with twists and crunches and such.

Becky, the girl in the video, was easy to follow. Sometimes my reps lined up with hers, and sometimes I felt she went too slowly, so I either added reps or adjusted my speed. She squats a little too deeply into her kettlebell swings, and I wish Bob corrected her, but she's clearly very fit and I already know how to do swings properly so it doesn't really matter to me. If you're new to kettlebells, I'd suggest spending a few minutes online learning the proper form for a KB swing before you begin.

Again, it's been two days. I can still feel my legs, core, and shoulders aching, so this must have been the challenge my body needed. I'm very happy with this and will continue to use it.",1501027200,,1281,4.195121951219512

8426836,4,B004EFCVP4,"This workout is in my regular rotation, and I like it a lot.  Here are some of the reasons:

  - You can vary the weight of the kettlebell you use, so the intensity is adjustable. I started using a 30lb kettlebell when the 20lb Bob uses seemed too easy.
  - The workout is fairly challenging, building both strength and cardio fitness, but it's also pretty low impact, especially if you modify the ""high knee.""

The workout is not without its weaker aspects, however:

  - Bob's cuing is less assured and fluid than in some other videos. Perhaps he was less familiar with kettlebells when he made this?
  - There is one instance where he does an exercise (the windmills holding the kettlebell overhead) twice on one side but only once on the other. That's really weird.

I can easily overlook the weaknesses since this DVD does seem to effectively combine strength and cardio training into one pretty straightforward workout (with mostly low impact).",1457827200,,950,4.754601226993865
