8210256,5,B000TP4FT8,"First off - I originally wrote this review for the UK Amazon site. A lot of the references here may be totally lost on American viewers. So - I apologise in advance.

I've always loved M. R. James and I can remember seeing this TV adaptation of ""Casting the Runes"" back in the 70s. Even for its own time I thought the special effects were tacky but they now strike me as being surprisingly effective. To be frank - I've now sat through so many CGI extravaganzas that by the time the end credits roll I've already forgotten it all. But this creaky old TV movie relies more on quick panning and suggestion. Just so you don't end up disappointed - all you see are a few shots of what appears to be a demonic image (possibly a statue), a superimposed gorilla's face, and a giant spider which looks like someone shaking a mop under a bed. There's also some whirling figures shot against a spinning globe. But - for me anyway - all these effects when actually seen in the context of the story are atmospheric and suggestive of inner rather than outer horror.

The cast includes a suitably worried Jan Francis (soon to turn up in the nauseating ""Just Good Friends"") and a superbly menacing Iain Cuthbertson whose overall participation comes to very little in terms of duration (which is probably just as well considering a rather dodgy American accent) but who is highly convincing as a personification of malice.

The music is a dissonant flute counterpoint, what sounds like slightly off tone strings and some radiophonic effects. Niiiiice! Also: a wonderfully chilly setting featuring imaginative use of winter landscapes. They don't make them like this anymore.

The extras: There is a short adaptation of ""Mr Humphreys and his Inheritance"" presented as a sequence for schools. This may make you feel you are set up for something amateurish but the film itself is effective enough to take its place alongside those wonderful BBC ""Ghost Stories for Christmas"" (It was actually made for ITV). This film has an introductory sequence which may make you think they've put on the wrong film. An actress - in what is clearly a 70s setting - walks along a corridor accompanied by different music. We are then introduced to a composer who looks like Tim Brooke Taylor with a seriously bad hairstyle (only in the 70s!) who talks about the transformative effect of music. For what it's worth the music actually used (and written by him) is an appropriate chilly dissonant chamber music reminiscent of neoclassical Stravinsky. As I've already said the film itself is very effective featuring some erudite stiff upper lip performances from Mr Humphreys and his manservant. I was a bit worried about how the ""wasp's head"" sequence would turn out but it's very well done with some basic animation.

There's also a biopic on M. R. James called ""A Pleasant Terror"" which is worth a look although it relies a bit too much on some creaky predictable little ""scary scenes"" - skulls, maggots, darkened rooms etc. I could also have done without the pompous condescension of Jonathan Miller. The presenter Bill Wallis has a fascinating theory that James's late ""A Vignette"" is a case of the author coming clean on the actual early - and traumatic - experience that inspired his literary fixation.

All in all - a treat for MRJ addicts.",1363305600,2,3309,4.766143106457243
8210257,4,B000TP4FT8,"Ghouls! Early 20th century short story turned film. Characteristic of author Montague Rhodes James who used more words depicting eeriness and horror than the ghost or being itself. His classic ghosties were short, often 20 pages or less, but packed. Some will object, preferring today's writing and filming where all the emphasis is placed on the occultist image, not the victim. The movie moves fast, and leaves much of the ghoul's characteristics left to the imagination of the viewer, just like M.R. James (1862-1936). Today's stories require much blood, witchcraft, and dramatic action; but CASTING THE RUNES allows the atmospheric view to inspire the viewer to greater heights of fear. OK, I jumped once.

SUBTITLED feature begins with the same beautiful eeriness of early master paintings of Andrew Wyeth, neutrals in winter. The story name comes from an action of writing a spell onto a paper and delivering it to the victim; who then has the option to reverse the spell by personally returning the note.
The novel story of 22 pages is played satanically by Iain Cuthbertson (Painted Lady) as the bad guy; Jan Francis (Dracula) as the beautiful next victim; and tosses in several others who are well known on Brit film soil, like Edward Petherbridge (The Brief Complete Collection).
47 min. modernized 1979 adaptation, since the book appeared prior to TVs and jet travel.
Enjoy it for what it is.",1360022400,,1403,5.021459227467811
8210258,1,B000TP4FT8,"Acting wasn't very good, background music was annoying, no suspense.  You get the basic plot but with no atmosphere or sense that anything unusual might be happening.  And that business with the ""spider""?  Ridiculous.  Altogether an overpriced bore.",1354147200,,249,5.473684210526316
8210259,5,B000TP4FT8,"Lawrence Gordon Clark, who helmed the production GHOST STORIES FOR CHRISTMAS,  also directed another story by M.R. James titled CASTING THE RUNES. This made for the series PLAYHOUSE, and was broadcast on ITV in 1979. Clive Exton adapted it from James source material and the setting is in a contemporary television studio in London.

The story here finds the producer and cast of a TV series imperiled by a notorious demonologist who casts a spell, inviting a series of supernatural occurrences and malevolent forces into their lives. The show is in color and although it pales in comparison to the B&W  1957 full-length feature film, NIGHT OF THE DEMON/ CURSE OF THE DEMON which is an excellent adaptation of James original story, I still found much to entertain me here and the cast especially more than made up for any outdated production details with their compelling performances.",1349136000,,885,5.006802721088436
8210260,1,B000TP4FT8,"I really enjoyed ""Night of the Demon"" with Dana Andrews so I felt enthusiastic about seeing another version. This was so bad. The leading female performer had Soap Opera instead of movie star quality. The changes that were made to the plot didn`t work. And at the end of the movie what should have been a grand finale between Karswell and the creature, was only spoken of. Not shown what had happened. This movie seemed like an insult to the classic story Casting the Runes. It`s a lesson for me to rent a movie first to see if it`s worth buying.",1264032000,6,546,4.415841584158416
