8699757,5,B00SXNLYNI,"Dr Paul Lam's ""The 24 Forms"" is the best dvd to learn the traditional 24 forms. It's simply the best of its kind. I also have ""tai chi for beginners"" with Chris Pei but Dr Lam's dvd is much better. No comparison is possible. With Dr Lam's dvd you always have a front & back view at the same time and it's divided into numerous chapters that are easy to navigate so you can find exactly the move you need to review. Very complete. Not a surprise why it's such a big success in sales.",1445904000,5,482,4.08421052631579
