8219756,5,B00000JSIC,"In terms of comedy, this tape beats all the other Alternative World tapes HANDS DOWN.  Fujisawa and Miz fans will especially enjoy the first episode in what I believe to be one of the most hilarious episodes in the series.  Love abounds as the group of Miz, Fujisawa, and Afura have found themselves  stuck on a pair of curious floating islands.  Without giving too much away,  the ambiance on the islands turns rather romantic, but not without humorous  interactions to give the viewer an overall sense of comedy.  Things turn  serious in the later episodes, but this particular tape is a must-own for  the El Hazard fan.",950745600,,622,4.738317757009346
