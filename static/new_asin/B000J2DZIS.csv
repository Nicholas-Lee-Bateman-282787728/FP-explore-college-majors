8148761,2,B000J2DZIS,"I purchased this DVD anxiously awaiting descriptions of early

Alaskan fishing techniques. This is actually a feature on the

history of early Alaskan Fishing Canneries. So, if you are

a cannery buff this DVD is for you. Dont, however, mistake the

title for accounts of early Alaskan recreational fishing.",1180742400,,307,5.204081632653061
