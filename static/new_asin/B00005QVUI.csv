8697473,4,B00005QVUI,"I'll be honest..I thought this was going to be some arty, shaky cam crap like the Strife One Truth Video..that was pathetic. This is a completely different story. Great filmwork. The sound is good also. If you were ever a fan of this influential band you need this DVD. The extra footage of their last show at Hellfest 2001 is worth the price of the whole DVD. Buy this!",1080518400,,370,4.3768115942028984
