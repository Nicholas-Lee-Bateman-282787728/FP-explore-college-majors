MOVIE REVIEW: PATTHAR KE PHOOL: A GOOD MOVIE WITH A LOT OF ACTION

This is one of the early movies of Salman Khan and in this movie his opposite lead is Raveena Tandon (for a change). Probably this is the only one movie in which Salman and Raveena have worked together in lead roles. The other role holders in Patthar Ke Phool are Kiran Kumar, Vinod Mehra, Reema Lagoo et al.

Patthar Ke Phool is about good and bad, fight between right and wrong and the eventualities one has to pay for while moving from a mafia to a normal life leaving all bad things. It becomes quite difficult to move away from the grip of the underworld once you become part of it.

We have a sincere police officers family from where Salman Khan is the latest entrant in the fray fighting against mafias and underworld dons. Then we have an underworld don who leads a normal life in society without anyone knowing about his real face, even to his daughter played by Raveena Tandon. But one fine day Raveena comes to know about the reality of her father. By that time, Raveena and Salman had fallen in love with each other. Raveenas father for the happiness of his daughter decides to come out of underworld activities totally and lead a good life.

But there are a lot of actions stored in the movie for you to keep hooked to the interesting story of Patthar Ke Phool. Overall it is a good movie with a lot of action and interesting twists in its story. The movie is produced under the banner of G P Sippy and directed by Anant Balani",1425600000,,1620,4.7304964539007095
