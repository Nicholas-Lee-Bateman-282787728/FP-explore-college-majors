5256256,5,B0093KZDVO,The actress Stacie who plays the police officer is my step daughter in-law. She is a great actor and the movie was well written. My whole family enjoyed it together and that is a rare occasion.,1421193600,,193,4.388888888888889
5256257,2,B0093KZDVO,"Hank (Larry Joe Campbell) and Dorothy (Mariann Mayberry) live in rural Michigan and have things go missing, such as their chickens. Hank sets up a camera to catch pictures of a large buck rumored to be in the woods. The production includes the nephew, a friend, a lady cop, and a neighbor with a dog. Unfortunately what it doesn't include is the Dogman. There are glimpses of it, but you see less than White Fang  and Black Tooth (Obscure Soup Sales reference to characters that only showed one paw while on the screen.)

The film moves slow. The title character appears in cameos. There is really no horror to it. The film makes minor attempts at humor and gives us good characters. They just did nothing with it.

Must be Larry Joe Campbell must have heard about it growing up here in Northern Michigan & decided it would make a decent movie but have seen much better ""true"" stories.",1383004800,,344,4.292307692307692

5256261,5,B0093KZDVO,I am probably biased because I live 5 minutes from Benzie County (where it was filmed). And I get a kick out of seeing locals act in the film. But I really liked it. The film reminded me of 70's styled thrillers. I bought the film and have been passing it around to everyone I work with. Some loved it just as much as i do. Others didn't.,1365465600,3,338,3.985294117647059
5256262,5,B0093KZDVO,"Absolutely LOVED  this movie! Fantastic story, acting, directing, locations, cinematography and balance of humor and terror. The fact that you never actually quite see the ""Dogman"" sends the fear factor way up... leaving it's appearence imagined in the viewer's mind....which is way more effective.",1356134400,2,298,5.7727272727272725

5256269,4,B0093KZDVO,"For what it is, this is not a bad movie. The script is somewhat intelligent and presents realistic characters rather than the caricatures you usually see in low-budget horror. You don't get to see much of the creature, which is not a bad thing as I doubt the budget would have afforded a realistic looking costume. This movie is kind of like watching the X-Files in a case where Mulder and Scully didn't show up. Looking forward to see what they do with the sequel.",1477526400,,465,4.482352941176471

5256273,5,B0093KZDVO,"I love to see a sequels even a series to go along this movie!  I love the way this movie had adventure, a good story line and the thrill factor.  It would be great to integrate Bigfoot into the story line.  A ""momma Sasquatch"" finds a"" baby Lycanthrope"" and raises it with her young sasquatch. They grow up to protect from a dangerous adversary lerking in a cave near town, a Dogman, the father of the young Lycan raised bybthe momma Sasquatch.  The story is to be continued... pcdavis80.  I would hope that all 0 to3 star movies become available for Prime customers with no added costs.",1471564800,4,587,4.4485981308411215
5256274,2,B0093KZDVO,"Released in 2012, Dogman is about Michigans legendary half-canine, half-human creature first supposedly sighted in 1987 in the northwestern quadrant of the Lower Peninsula. The star is that goofy rotund guy from the sitcom According to Jim (who has since lost the weight). Mariann Mayberry plays his wife, Kimberly Guerrero a Native American neighbor and Stacie Mitchell (aka Stacie Hadgikosti) an investigating deputy.

Despite an outstanding opening & closing folk-rock song, presumably by Grant Floering (whos credited for the music), and the presence of a few formidable actors, you can tell this is a micro-budget flick right out of the gate. The slow-going, mundane proceedings don't help. For instance, theres a scene of the deputy interviewing two teens at the hospital thats just tedious and unnecessary. The runtime couldve easily been cut in half. Then there are some inexplicable elements, like all the time spent on the tree camera, but we mysteriously never get to see the footage. The ending leaves you with a big question mark and the potential for a sequel (which materialized in 2014 with, amazingly, the same cast). Speaking from someone who appreciates low-budget woods-oriented flicks, Dogman is just too uneventful and pedestrian with uninteresting characters. Still, its competently made for a no-budget flick. Its just not that entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.

The movie runs 90 minutes and was shot in Benzie County, Michigan.

5256275,2,B0093KZDVO,"This was filmed on a low budget, not that it's a bad thing, but they didn't come up with anything creative or interesting.  The characters were boring and not very interesting and the title character of the movie you only see fleeting glimpses of.  I wouldn't recommend this film at all.",1468540800,,287,4.607843137254902
5256276,3,B0093KZDVO,"i was enjoying it for it's well done creepiness but the end was a huge let down, felt like it needed another 15 minutes to resolve a few things. I know there is a sequel but there were things that needed to be wrapped up in this movie, i think.",1467244800,,244,3.9

5256282,4,B0093KZDVO,"It was exactly what I was looking to watch, a movie that was not too serious, with silly but likable characters that grew on you just enough to see if they survive through it. Rivals creepiness of other monster legends that you wouldn't want in your backyard. I will want to watch Dogman 2 when its available.",1464998400,,309,4.43859649122807
5256283,1,B0093KZDVO,No stars.  The only reason I gave it one star was the rating would not post until I gave it a least one star. It was awful amateur acting and where was the Dogman??  Skip Don't waste your time.,1464307200,,193,3.923076923076923
5256284,5,B0093KZDVO,Ain't the best acting but nearly flawless!!! One of the few horror films that I wished was 2 HOURS LONG as opposed to the standard hour and a half. It shows you don't have to actually SEE the monster that often to get you engrossed in the film. I really felt it ended too soon regardless.,1461283200,,288,4.160714285714286
5256285,1,B0093KZDVO,"Film students can learn from this. It's an amateur effort. I like all the actors. I think the directing and plotline are weak. There is some overacting and slow pacing is chronic. Laggy.. Continuity is okay. The monster is inadequate. No one in their right mind would believe in anything after watching this movie. Fear of nature has reached intolerable levels in the USA today. This exemplifies total fear and superstitious reaction in any natural environment, day or night. No science will ever be done by these fictional ""investigators."" You'd have to assume everyone was ripping at each other with knives and eating their pets and livestock like they do in moslem hellholes. This film doesn't even rise up to the low level of the worst of Stephen King's films. (I like a lot of his films, but the bad ones really suck.) If you want to watch this because of the idea that there are weird creatures being reported, you'll be better off looking for actual dogumentaries rather than this dog of a fiction film. Also you know damn well the only reason that kid in the hospital didn't turn into dogman was lack of funds for CGI. Also, there are only two aging 30 y.o. ""boys"" in the whole town, so you'd think the uncle and the rookie cop would both be able to clue in and know that those two boys are the ones getting into all these Hardy Boys scrapes.",1459814400,,1350,4.536885245901639
5256286,4,B0093KZDVO,"I Liked it.  The acting was pretty good and the movie was very entertaining. For me the movie was free since I am a Prime Member. If you are paying to watch it, I don't know if you would consider it a waste of money to be mildly entertained.  One thing that was interesting is that they showed the Gable ""Dogman"" tape from the late 60's or 70's.  You must know that video tape was a hoax.  They interviewed the guy who made it and he even furnished the costume that was used.  I have to admit that when I first saw that darn video, I fell for it.  Then later, I found the interview with the fellow who created it. But, who knows. There may very well be a dogman out there!  This is one clean cut movie.  No sex, drugs or anything like that, so the kids in the family might really like it!",1459382400,6,788,4.006410256410256

5256289,3,B0093KZDVO,"Our expectations weren't overly high, and we all enjoyed it.  If you're from Michigan, this is a fun movie to watch.  It's not really scary, and we didn't  expect it to be.",1449792000,,172,4.3125
5256290,4,B0093KZDVO,"This movie is a low budget modern take on typical 70s B-movie. Not a lot of flashy special effects just a a good solid storyline. Sure it does drag a little in some parts, acting ability is ok. I have a hard time taking Larry Joe in a serious role, has some borderline tongue-in-cheek humor. Being a Michigander just love that it was shot local. Only gripe is the abrupt ending thought they could a did a better story wrapup. Highly recommend, also save your money on this stand alone and buy this movie in the `Fantasy Horror Collection V.1 featuring Dire Wolf '.",1444867200,,564,4.4326923076923075
5256291,2,B0093KZDVO,"The story of ""Dogman"" uses the legend of the creature to create an ominous set-up, with a couple struggling between, what they believe to be the acts of delinquent relatives causing property damage, or some other force terrorizing them. It soon becomes clear just what the situation is, and Brauer uses some classic tricks to tease the creature on camera. Some moments work and others show up on screen as uber-cheap. Budget- I know. The cast, for the most part, give pretty decent performances. Oddly enough the most seasoned among them-Larry Joe Campbell-gives the least convincing performance. The story arc never really falls apart, leaving most of the flubs to technical issues with special effects shots, and inability to create necessary thrills when needed.

The special effects are super low budget, when used, give poor quality and weak performance. Brauer does show prowess in his ability to create some suspenseful moments by leaving a lot of the creature off camera for the most part. Similar to how the werewolf creature in ""Silver Bullet"" is used. For the most part the actual effectiveness of the film's horror element comes from melodrama, creepy soundtracks, and the legend of the Dogman. There are better wolf-creature films out there that bring the beast clearly into the terror-zone but ""Dogman"" does give good story. It hits just below the 50/50 point with me personally.",1431907200,,1393,5.08296943231441

8535230,2,B0093KZDVO,"(Moderate Spoilers) Okay, get a few drinks in you first, and this movie just might be tolerable, the key word being ""might"" since it never really rises above a TV-movie scale.  But I've seen worse movies and worse acting, although I know that's not exactly a glowing movie review.  ""Hanklin"" (Larry Joe Campbell of TV's ""According to Jim"") and his wife begin to notice strange goings-on around their rural homestead, with similar events simultaneously occurring to his nephew and their small town.  Apparently the Indian legend of a ""Dogman"" (think Bigfoot but with a dog head...and smaller feet, LOL) has awakened in the area, but we find out that it's actually not a male after all (I guess ""Dogwoman"" didn't sound terrifying enough, LOL).  But, make no mistake, she is a meanie! ;) Oh, and if an animal is scratched by it, it may die, but you may live if you're human and only get scratched (not eaten), though it's not really clear, consistent with other vague aspects of the movie.  And, ironically enough, the least scary part of the movie is when they show the Dogman itself...well, sort of, since it's hard to see.  Maybe the producers should've steered away from ever showing it at all because, in this case, as in most scary legends, imagining it would have been scarier than actually (sort of) seeing it.  But preteens may go for it, and at least there's no grisly violence or provocative scenes (just a little cursing), so it fits the bill at least in that way and is otherwise harmless (that's why it earned 2 stars).  It must be said, though, that it's very interesting how we have yet to see ""Citizen Kane Part II,"" yet the door is left ajar for a ""Dogman"" sequel! ;)",1508112000,,1682,4.620805369127517
