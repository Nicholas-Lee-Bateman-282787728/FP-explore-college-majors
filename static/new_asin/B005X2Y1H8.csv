8488215,1,B005X2Y1H8,"I thought this was great becasue I saw this version online and loved it
So I bought it but after watching it I was shocked at how bad the translation was just plain awful.
Seriously did they let a first grader type the subtitles into it and thought it was good.
They screwed up the characters names and thier sentences were not done properly at all. If I had the ability to hack the DVDs and change the subtitles I would do so in a heart beat. So unless you have that ability to change the subtitles or understand Japanese. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL!!!!!
Buy the other one the translation is so much better it is done beautifuly (Except for the last episode)
Unless they say the fixed their Translations and prove they did so
Do not buy this set it is a waste of moeny you will spend.",1389052800,,781,4.178807947019868
8488216,1,B005X2Y1H8,I watched the 2007 version online and loved it so much that I wanted to see if the 2011 remake was worth watching. My husband sweetly purchased this for a Christmas present and at the time I was so excited to receive it. But once I put it in my DVD player all excitement left. The subtitles were so bad that the show was nearly impossible to watch. This purchase was a waste of money to me and unless you speak japanese you will waste you money too.,1325203200,,449,4.113636363636363
