1828396,4,B000087F3G,"I'm not sure what motivated me to order this---except that I find the work of each director interesting, and the price is sure right.  When I order a public domain cheapie I'm prepared for poor prints, noisy audio, etc.  But I was absolutely knocked out by the print quality and transfers on BOTH of these movies.  The Superscope ""Burma"" is even enhanced for widescreen.  The color was mostly good on both movies, and I didn't notice any significant film damage or dirt.  The movies are OK, interesting primarily because of the casts.  Both leading ladies were a bit long in the tooth for their roles, but they still show their star quality.

VCI gets a gold star for a release that looks like WHV did it from the original elements.  The artwork is enough to scare anyone away, however.

And I really wish that they wouldn't have one of their people write Amazon reviews for their product.

If you want a couple of pretty good Saturday afternoon flicks very well presented, you just can't go wrong.",1182902400,37,998,4.619318181818182
1828397,4,B000087F3G,"RKO double feature.

This DVD presents two RKO jungle movies produced by Benedict Bogeaus in color.

Appointment in Honduras, 1953, 79 min., with Glen Ford and Ann Sheridan. Directed by Jacques Tourneur.

Glenn Ford forces a sea captain to drop him off the Honduras Coast with a bunch of prisoners, and taking Ann Sheridan and her husband along as hostages. Jungle movies tend to be somewhat alike in that as they struggle through the jungle, you get to know what people are really like. This is no exception, but you will have to wait to last minute to find out what makes Glenn Ford's character tick.

Escape to Burma, 1955, 88 min., with Barbara Stanwick and Robert Ryan. Directed by Allan Dwann.

Robert Ryan is an adventurer suspected of murder who seeks refuge in Barbara Stanwick's tea plantation. As she is as indomitable and lonely as a woman can be, she is soon fighting the world to keep him, but is he worth the trouble?

The DVD features the actors and directors' bios plus three different trailers of RKO movies.",1142121600,12,1026,4.6722222222222225

Escape to Burma has a number of audio dropouts, two of which are during dialogue.  I can live with a dropout if necessary, but not during dialogue.  Burma is presented widescreen.  Appintment in Honduras is in it's original fullscreen.  Trailers for Burma and other releases.",1382745600,,419,5.17910447761194

is barely watchable,i spent so much time adjusting the picture i lost track of the story,such as it was. Escape to Burma was so washed out and blurry i threw it in the bin after five minutes. Amazingly this dvd recieved five star reviews!!Who is writing them?Do not waste your money on this rubbishy presentation",1191196800,12,532,4.610526315789474
