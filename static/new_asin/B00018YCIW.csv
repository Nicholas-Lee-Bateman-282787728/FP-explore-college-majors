1978564,5,B00018YCIW,"I bought the complete cartoon series for my kids after having seen the story with the fly in his bedroom, on tv. I didn't expect to enjoy the cartoon that much. When I got them, I couldn't stop watching. amazing!!! I admired how they could really transform the real mr. bean in cartoons, his mimics, his way of moving around, or driving around... the stories are hilarious, not too long, and cool. not only for kids, but for adults too. have a nice good laugh",1226966400,,459,4.411764705882353
1978565,5,B00018YCIW,"We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old.

We have the entire set, all six volumes. Our kids love these DVDs.

I like them because the absence of dialogue forces our children to figure out the storyline. I also like the fact that the humor is family-friendly and that I don't have to suffer through an hour of ""I wants"" after a Saturday morning cartoon fest chock full of commercials.

If you have young children, this is a great buy. The individual stories run about 5-8 minutes each, so you can moderate how much they watch without having to commit to a 90-minute Disney movie.

There are three sets of DVDs, each two volumes in length. The double sets are better priced than buying each volume individually.",1216425600,,717,4.492307692307692
1978566,5,B00018YCIW,"With this set it becomes official, there is more animated Bean than live-action... even if you include the films!
I say, if you like Mister Bean, buy this. It's fun.",1209254400,,165,4.533333333333333
1978567,5,B00018YCIW,"I purchased Mr. Bean for my husband for Christmas. My 10 year old granddaughter saw the tape and fell in love with Mr. Bean. This summer when discussing Christmas, she said she was going to ask Santa to bring her a Mr. Bean just like Grandpas. Doesn't matter what age you are, Mr. Bean is enjoyed by all.",1154390400,5,304,4.258620689655173

1978634,5,B00018YCIW,"My children adore this cartoon.  I have never been a fan of Mr. Bean myself.  He tends to gross me out.  I do not have that reaction to the cartoon in any capacity.  It is similar in style to the live action show, but animation is a much more comfortable medium for this sense of humor.  The animation is also adorably done and the story lines quite funny.  We have been watching this animated series for years and my children never seem to tire of it.",1416787200,,452,4.1976744186046515
