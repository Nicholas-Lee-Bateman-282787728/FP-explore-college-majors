7802606,1,555987311X,"It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time!! Bad acting, cheesy and totally predictable. Megan Follows was the only good thing and she only had a bit part. Even she was not at her best. Do not waste you're money on it!!!!!!!!",1388707200,,232,4.065217391304348
7802607,5,555987311X,"An excellent family friendly film.
There is no offensive language or dress in this movie.
The PG rating must be for the movie's suspenseful plot,
though there is also plenty of laughter waiting for you.
Follow Chris and Pat as they try to solve the mysterious
disappearance of Chris's younger sister Molly.
The bubble gum scene and motel check-in scene are two of our favorites!
You'll have to watch it to see what I mean :-)
Add this one to your family collection.
It is a slumber party favorite at our house!
It was good to see Megan Follows in this film...
