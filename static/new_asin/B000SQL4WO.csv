2889810,4,B000SQL4WO,"My daughter loves the original Silly Songs DVD, so we decided to get this one too. While I think the original is still her favorite, this one is just as much fun to sing along with.

The only concern I have is that the title music that plays on the DVD menu is a little scary for younger kids. Other than that, this is a great collection of silly songs that we love to sing along with.",1277424000,,385,4.0
2889811,4,B000SQL4WO,"I actually bought this as a gag gift (inside joke) for my friend's 21st birthday but we did sit down and watch some of the ""Veggie Tales Sing Alongs: End of Silliness"".

2889815,5,B000SQL4WO,"My 8 month old LOVES the veggie tales silly songs. The full length movies don't keep her attention yet, but the singing does so these videos are perfect. I don't like to set her in front of the tv too often, but when I need to return some important calls or catch up on some cleaning....I pop this dvd in and I know I have a solid 30 minutes to get things done w/o any crying!",1397174400,,376,3.960526315789474

2889820,3,B000SQL4WO,"My grandson loves the veggi tales silly songs, but the way this was organized and plays he wasn't over thrilled with it. We have two other silly song DVD's he likes much better. This one might get moved to the car as a back up.",1360195200,,227,4.066666666666666
2889821,4,B000SQL4WO,"The beginning sequence is Larry having a nightmare, and made me really doubt if I wanted to continue. Maybe it was because the music is really loud compared to the rest of the video, or because it didn't make any sense. Either way, that part still bugs me every time my kids want to watch it.

However, the songs are good and ones we like. And that's the point of having this DVD. So I'll deal with the beginning, like how you have to eat the brussel sprouts before you get dessert...",1329177600,2,484,4.260869565217392

2889823,5,B000SQL4WO,"I became a Veggie Tales fan back in college, and was excited to introduce it to our toddlers. They love the first Veggie Tales Sing Along video (which I only had in VHS format from years ago); it really came in handy during a week when we were all sick. In May we took a long road trip with our twins, then 16 months old, and ordered this for them to watch in the car. They LOVED it, and watched it over and over! Definitely made our road trip easier. :)",1280361600,3,454,4.0
