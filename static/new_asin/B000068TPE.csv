1726760,5,B000068TPE,"In the Masque of the Red Death, one of Edgar Allan Poe's tales, Vincent Price plays Prospero, a devil-worshipping prince. He is a sadist that stays within his castle, with his aristocratic friends, while the plague rages. Prospero practices cruelty in his castle, until ""Death"" enters and his guest start dying of the plague.
In Premature Burial, another of Edgar Allan Poe's tales, Ray Milland is terrified of being buried alive and has put in many escape route incase he is buried alive. There is an excellent sequence in which Milland has a vision of being buried alive. After falling into a cataleptic-state he is buried alive, once revived and released, he is takes revenge. The movie has gloomy graveyards, spooky mansions, fog, spider webs, and bats for atmosphere.",1029888000,2,772,4.992248062015504

It acutely combines several Poe stories -- Masque of Red Death, Hop Toad -- and does so quite well. Very good for its time at combining elements of horror, depravity,  vs goodness and innocence.

This is the first of the Price-Corman-Poe series to be shot in London, where they had access to much bigger stock sets of a Medieval nature, and Corman had a bigger budget and longer shooting time overall, making for a much better picture.  Price is a fantastic villain, as usual, but I love him just as much as a sympathetic anti-hero, as in the first film in this Poe series, Roderick Usher in HOUSE OF USHER.  I recommend ALL the Price-Corman-Poe films--I think there are 7 or 8 total--but if you are only going to see one this Halloween, MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH is a stellar choice.",1444176000,,720,4.609375

1726850,4,B000068TPE,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this Vincent Price horror classic...

Vincent Price gives a very good performance in this movie version of the Poe horror classic, Masque Of The Red Death (1964).  What I like about this movie is the dark atmosphere, the sets (although on the cheap side), the acting, the costumes, and the use of vivid, vibrant color throughout.  There were some changes made in this movie that are different than Edgar Allan Poe's story, but I'll leave it to you to see what they are.  I don't want to give anything away.

Really not much more needs to be said about this classic.  If you like horror movies with Vincent Price in them, then The Masque Of The Red Death is a good place to start.  Highly recommended.",1417910400,,791,4.52112676056338
1726881,4,B000068TPE,"The Premature Burial:  A wealthy medical student/artist has a morbid fear of being buried alive.  As such he builds a burial crypt filled with fail-safes so he can escape should he come to.  Everything in his life revolves around this fear.  The house is filled with heavy furniture and dark colors and he won't allow flowers inside because they remind him of funerals.  The landscape around the house is full of barren trees and ALWAYS shrouded in fog.  No wonder he's a barrel of laughs.  His wife tries to get him out of this obsessive funk.  I won't spoil the rest for you.  Not bad Corman flick with good performances.  The DVD is excellent quality.  Recommended for Poe inspired Corman film fans.
I will comment on The Masque of the Red Death as soon as I watch it.",1414454400,2,771,4.5144927536231885

1726888,4,B000068TPE,"Here's the perfect example of vision, enthusiasm, and sheer talent triumphing over shoestring budgets & short shooting schedules. In bringing this classic Poe tale to the screen (and incorporating other Poe material into it fairly seamlessly), producer-director Roger Corman & novelist-screenwriter Richard Matheson brought European art film sensibilities into headlong collision with the drive-in ethos ... and the result was an emotionally moody, visually stunning little masterpiece whose horror is more existential than you might expect. Oh, the shocks & thrills are there, in true early 1960s style: jolting for a moment, but never terribly gory. And there's that undercurrent of tongue-in-cheek dark humor found in many Corman films, which in this case makes a strong counterpoint to the genuinely artistic tone of the story. This is nothing less than a cousin to something like Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" -- a distant cousin, it's true, but definitely a blood relation.

But of course the rich, juicy, overripe plum at the center of this deliciously perverse pie is Vincent Price. What a performance! He uses both voice & body language with precision, knowing when to go over the top for emphasis rather than mere camp, while at other times bringing everything down to a soft, muted whisper for maximum effect. In later films he clearly had a ball hamming it up; in this film he's a master craftsman. The rest of the cast is uniformly solid & quite good -- but he's just superb.

As for the second feature, it's actually not bad at all for what it is, a solid & competent piece of entertainment ... but it inevitably pales beside the decadently lucious main feature, which is the one you'll return to again & again. To see Ray Milland really perform strongly in a chilling Corman film, ""X, the Man With the X-Ray Eyes"" awaits your viewing pleasure.

So -- 4 & 1/2 stars stars? For this film to be as good as it is, when viewers probably expected a whole lot less, I'd say that's deserved. It not only delivers the goods with poetic style & panache, it raises the material to remarkable heights. Happily recommended!",1372118400,4,2124,4.927374301675978
1726889,5,B000068TPE,"Vincent Price, in my opinion, is inarguably The True Master of the Macabre...and The Masque of the Red Death you'll find substantiates this claim.  The story is about a plague referred to as the Red Death; and Prince Prospero (Vincent Price), who denies refuge in his castle, to the local villagers.  Prince Prospero is in league with Satan...and believes his life and those of his hand picked house guests will be spared the Red Death because of his unholy union with the Lord of the Underworld.  But an unexpected visitor has Satan's guest card to Prospero's shindig; and all I can say is, ""When this Dude  Comes a Knocking Forget Anymore Rockin'!""  The Masque of the Red Death gets a perfect 5 star rating from this reviewer...and is a suggested must buy to all of you true horror enthusiasts.
PS...Actress Hazel Court also does an outstanding job in her role!
Now with regards to The Premature Burial, we are dealing with an individual named Guy (played by actor Ray Milland), who believes he has an inherited disease referred to, as catalepsy...per Webster- A condition in which there is a rigidity of the muscles, causing the patient to remain in a fixed postion or posture.  Respiration was so slight, and with all the other appearances of death, a number of individuals probably in the eighteenth or nineteenth century were inadvertently buried alive.  This obsession consumes Guy (Milland), as he builds himself a home away from home where if he is buried alive...he believes he can escape using a number of inventions he has equipped his second home with.  Hazel Court is also in this movie...and does a most convincing job in her role, as Milland's wife!

1726911,5,B000068TPE,"The Masque of the Red Death (1964) is a definitive vehicle for Vincent Price and on my list of top ten favorite horror movies. I have a large collection of Vinnie P. movies and am still surfing for more. I've read his biography written by his daughter, Victoria, and I've read the full-color filmography (both books are available here on Amazon); I even have a 12 inch doll with authentic clothing from the Raven (1963) as well as audio recordings of Vinnie reading Poe on CD; Mr. Price is a major inspiration to my novels (I even quoted the original short story in my first book) and his passing in 1993 was truly a sad, though expected, loss for all of us Monster Kids who roam Necropolis nightly in anticipation of his ghoulish return from the eternal sleep of Morpheus.

Rest easy, Vincent, knowing that you're still loved by us crazed fans...cue in manical laughter.

Now, about the movie: the color palette is magnificent and the music is creepy, but as is Roger Corman's style, the plot differs some from the classic tale of Poe...er, uh, that is, woe...In the short story there is no obsession with the virginal blonde beauty and there is no Hollywood-esque Satanic Cult; the short story is very mush about the fear of plague and the selfishness and short-sightedness of people of wealth, which reflects Poe's angst and frustration with never having enough money to support a sickly wife; the belief that this horror cannot befall me because I'm TOO important to die, ad nauseum, plays out with disastrous and karmic results. The sets are sumptuous and Price is at his evil-best. The scene where the tilt-of-the-hat appearance of the raven attacks the Queen of Evil (Hazel Court) is one of the greatest and most iconic in the movie and second only to the whirlwind realization that Prince Prospero has not only seen the manifestation of the Red Death but in trying to flee from it is trapped with the truth that it is he; his surrender is none too soon as he attempts to defy his fate unto his breath. The movie staple of ""we have met the enemy and it is us"" as well as the social ramifications that you only doom yourself if you choose to ignore danger both develop here in Corman's visual masterpiece of Edgar Allan Poe's tomb haunting tale of terror.

Premature Burial (1962) Ray Milland (Battlestar Galactica, The Man With X-Ray Eyes and Frogs) fills in for Mr. Price in this Corman look through the mirror darkly of Poe's greatest fear of being buried alive; suffering from a sleeping disorder both Poe and the character in the original short story (as well as the movie) is terrified of waking up in a coffin and scratching to get out; this theme has appeared aften in movies (there are three movies with the title of Buried Alive that explore this theme, right here on Amazon!); this movie is subdued in comparison to the Price appearances in the other Poe films (Tales of Terror, The Raven, House of Usher, Twisted Tales of Terror, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Masque of the Red Death, Tomb of Ligea, The Oblong Box and Murders in the Rue Morgue; The Haunted Palace and War-Gods of the Deep are based off of Lovecraft and Verne, respectively) and Mr. Milland does a marvelous job in tormenting us in this colorful, bewitching entry in Corman's Poe cycle.

The Haunting of Morella is technically the last one but wasn't shot until 1989 and lacks both Price and that 1960's lensing atmosphere that makes the others both memorable and awesome, although Nicole Eggert is quite fetching as the ill-fated girl possessed by the ghost of her demented mother.

I still have a vinyl 32"" sound effects album, The Monster Mash and Other Sounds of Terror, from my childhood that has tiny stories told with dialogue and sound effects, one of these stories involves being buried alive. I cherish this form of discarded storytelling that lets the mid fashion its own world of whimsy and wonder.",1352505600,,3895,4.67201166180758

1726916,3,B000068TPE,"Masque of the Red Death
--------------------------
Roger Corman returns  to the works of Edgar Allen Poe with what many may consider to be his finest film. When the local noblemen are threatened by the plague of the Red Death that is ravishing the countryside, they seek safe haven within the walls of the maligned Prince Prospero's castle. Prospero engages them in extravagant feasts leading up to his grand masquerade ball, while also including them in his Satanic rituals in order to secure their souls for his master. As the contagion quickly approaches, Prospero is left to decide the fates of the remaining peasants that are left pleading for sanctuary at the gates of the castle as well as the fates of his corrupt companions. MASQUE'S depiction of profanity and excess that rules the upper class serves to drive the struggle  between the peasants and their lords. Their ironic end proves that money and power are just an illusion in the face of death. Prince Prospero becomes one of Vincent Price's most profoundly sinister roles, which he plays without a hint of camp or silliness unlike in many of his other performances of the time. Corman's lavish color palette and baroque stylism are reflective of his long time influences Ingmar Bergman and Frederico Fellini. Of the many stunning compositions laid out on screen, Juliana's nightmarish dream sequence and the eloquently evil masquerade ball that is alluded to in the title stand out as being two of his most impressive visual achievements. With THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, Roger Corman seals his place as one of the Masters of Horror.

Premature Burial
-------------------------
A newlywed husband begins living in a state of paralyzing fear after uncovering the tomb of a man who was buried alive. His wife and family friend force him to confront his obsession with his own death, which causes him to fall into a death-like state that ultimately leads to his own premature burial. Roger Corman attempts to fill this lifeless Edgar Allen Poe adaptation with fog-laced environments and roving cameras, but the above average production is hardly able to mask the tedious plotting and passable performances. The attempt that is made to recover the pacing following Guy's ""return"" from the dead proves to be too little too late to win back the audience. Ray Milland brings very little with his performance, appearing stiff and unsympathetic as the film's paranoid lead. PREMATURE BURIAL does include a colorful nightmare sequence similar to the one that had been used months earlier in PIT AND THE PENDULUM, where he finds himself trapped in his own tomb with nothing save for the sound of his own heartbeat. This may fall in the lower end of the spectrum for Corman's Poe cycle, but it still provides enough atmosphere and suspense to appeal to most Gothic Horror fans.

The cinematography is artistic and well done for that era. The twists in the plot keep the movie engaging. The costumes and set pieces are very lavish.

The Masque of The Red Death was average. It deserves 3 stars. The plot is a little trite and very slow moving. Vincent Price plays a satanist prince. Although you will not see too many black magic rituals, spells, or any demons rising from hell. The movie plays out like your typical Epic fantasy movie. There are plenty of scenes of Vincent Price tormenting villagers and harassing his guests. Most of the movie takes place inside a lavish castle. Vincent Price throws lavish parties and pontificates about religion and death throughout the entire movie. The costumes are lavish and the acting is good.

The Devil, you say?  The Masque of the Red Death is the first feature of this flip-around DVD.  Roger Corman directs and produces another Poe-related story, this time telling the story of the tyrant Prospero, played to its evil height by Vincent Price.  He arrives at a village, ostensibly thanking them for harvest.  In response they grumble and one guy tells him where he can take his thanks.  Oops.  Mayhem ensues.

Corman weaves quite the tapestry of eerie imagery, only touched on with ""The Pit and The Pendulum.""  The dream sequence with Juliana becoming betrothed to Satan is horrific and somehow sexually interesting, in a perverse sort of way.

Who is the Red Death was a shocker, had no clue.

The macabre scenes (burning man) and the colored rooms and colored disguises were masterfully done.  The red and green candles, and so on, paint an imagery within an imagery.  Nicely done.

Features on this side of DVD Hell:  Roger Corman Behind the Masque == interesting thought processes, making of feature; he goes over ALL his Poe films, discusses the studio problems, production situations and that ""Masque"" is his best one.  Amazing use of colored lighting, scenery, distorted lens and intense music by David Lee.

Interestingly, he states he studied the German Expressionist films of the 1920s, as well as Hitchcock and Bergman, when making the Poe films.  Didn't know that!

And of course the inevitable trailer which gives the whole shock ending away!  Thanks a lot!!

***

Lay me down!  Roger Corman could not get Vincent for The Premature Burial, so picked up actor Ray Milland, who has done a few scifi films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-The-Man-with-the-X-Ray-Eyes/dp/B00005AUK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X - The Man with the X-Ray Eyes</a>, etc.), does not do a bad job as Guy, a medical student who is scared to death (pun) of being buried alive!

Ray plays a man who is on the edge, who paints weird paintings and drinks to death.  He even builds a crypt that is escape-proof.  His wife, played by the same actress as in Masque, Hazel Court, plays a role in this film with the theme I've seen before -- pretty much guessed early on what was happening, but the ending left me a bit flat.

Milland is a very proper mad Britain in this film.  He walks through his part in some odd inconsistent way that does not play right the way Vincent Price would have played it.  Decent Corman film, not as good as Masque, not only because of the miscast Ray Milland but also the effects though interesting did not create that atmosphere of the macabre that I've come to love about Price films.

Its saving grace was in the use of music -- the wide mouth followed by the horn in the background was quite chilling in the (inevitable) dream sequence.

Roger Corman interview gets into the mind of the man who made both films, I found very interesting and may attract the amateur movie-maker.

Overall, the MGM Midnite series is awesome and should be purchased in all its incarnations.

This film was another predictably good Roger Corman production with grand sets, costumes, story and acting.  After rewatching all three of Roger Corman's Poe films for 1960 through 1962 I started asking myself how many times can you make a film about premature burial?  If you think about it, the theme of Corman's first three Poe films all involved a creepy setting with crypts, an unwanted guest, and premature burial of one kind or another.

I don't agree that the Masque of the Red Death was one of Corman's best films but it was a nice change from the overused theme of premature burial.  I missed the Masque when it first came out in 1964 but was lucky enough to have a friend who was a film editor bring it to my home on 16 mm in 1971 for a private showing.

1726934,5,B000068TPE,"The transfer of these to dvd in my mind look great with colors from the sets really coming through on Masque of the Red Death.  Even Premature burial looked better than I thought it would.  The sound quality is o.k. and nothing really special meaning its not bad but not the best.

I have never seen either one of these films and I hoped both were Vincent Price but to my disappointment he wasn't.  There is an explanation for that though and many review have already covered it.  I know they are based on Poe's work but my understanding is its pretty loosely based.  I have never read either  before but it did intrigue me to the point where I think I am going to buy some more Poe books.  Vincent Price almost makes his role look to easy for him to play since he is so good at it and I thought that he fit his character from the movie perfectly.  The satanism part caught me off guard but a nice point to make the prince look even madder and more wicked.  I would say Vincent Price made the movie all the more enjoyable and the story content fit him perfect.  The overall feel of the movie to me was a expensive play but a fantastic one at that and I hoped would last longer.  I really can't compare it to Poe's work since like I said I haven't read it.  Overall I say a great movie.

The Premature Burial on the other hand was completely different experience though dark with a slower pace.  I never knew who Ray Milland was until thankfully I watched Panic in the Year Zero the other day and he was great in it.  I still thought when I bought this movie it starred Vincent Price and I found myself wondering how much he could of put into the character.  Ray Milland does a great job though and I wish I would of watched it first since the pacing and the overall feeling to The Masque was darker and faster (though not too fast) and overall more enjoyable.  I didn't really enjoy it as much which I guess could be I was expecting Vincent Price but the overall story is great though and nicely acted.  I did feel the movie rushed to its climax and never really felt that drawn into it since it was over so fast.  The man was tortured by himself but I never really felt like it would make him insane but I guess if I read the story I will be able to get into more but like I said its still a good watch.

Overall I am glad I made this purchase even though I wanted more Vincent Price its still worth it and going in my classic collection.",1230854400,,2439,4.13588110403397
1726935,5,B000068TPE,"""Masque of Red Death"" is definitely the best of the Corman/Price/Poe series.  While many point out the well-budgeted, lavish set in comparison to the previous films, I believe this one is superior based on the story and solid characters alone.

It departs from the formula of the others in the series by being more tightly focused, more sinister, and the least camp of them all.  It is refreshing to see Price maintain a sinister voice with his character that leaves little room for calling him ""campy"" or overdone.  It's also nice that, as Prospero, he is not the usual loner, isolated in a decaying castle and pining over some lost love that still haunts him.  This film moves away from that yet still utilizes the Vincent Price mannerisms we all love, but laser-focused and more potent with a singular character type.

The Man in Red's presence and voice is perfectly chilling and gives this picture much more weight with his mystery, measured philosophy, and subtle power.",1225584000,,976,4.849397590361446

1726937,5,B000068TPE,"[This review is part of my 31 days of Halloween series.]

This is a fantastic double-your-horror bill.

MASQUE OF THE RED features B horror flixs luminaries Vincent Price, Hazel Court, Jane Asher & Nigel Green under the equisite direction of Roger Gorman. I use the designation ""B"" lovingly & in homage to Roger Gorman's frugal ways in making these movies not only possible, but also making them forever memorable.

The plot is simple. Plague is ravaging the countryside & the only place of safety is in a Satanic prince's castle. Well, his quests think it's safe, but they are really going from the cauldron into the fire. In addition to the acting & direction & script, other outstanding elements in this movie are the costumes & the splendid use of color, the choreography, and the strange dream sequence.

PREMATURE BURIAL stars veteran Ray Milland & Hazel Court. The plot revolves around the very real fear people had of being buried alive at the end of the Victorian era--well, just about everybody was metaphorically buried alive at the end of the Victorian era, but that's a whole other tale of terror. I remarked about thisvery real fear in my review THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER because the fear of being lterally being buried alive figured in that plot of that film too, but it takes center stage in PREMATURE BURIAL.

Before the 20th century the process of death & decomposition was little understood. For example, the belief in vampirism was in part fueled by the fact that some exhumed bodies still looked lifelike, the nails appeared to have grown because the tissue around them had retreated; in like manner the teeth appeared longer & blood seemed to be on the lips as another stage of the natural process. When people suspected someone of being a vampire, they opened the grave & saw all this & when they drove a stake in the chest sometimes the body seemed to groan as air was forced out of the chest gavity.

These signs also caused people to think that premature burial was more prevalent than it ever could have been--or at least one would hope. Again, some corpses from graves that were open for one reason or another appeared to have, in fact, been buried alive--all beause of the ordinary process of decomposition.

In the film Ray Milland's character has the fear big time & his efforts to prevent being accidentally buried alive are trully obsessive compulsive & appropriately creepy.

Both these films are outstanding dark flowers of their genre.

1726940,5,B000068TPE,"Horror legend, Vincent Price, stars in ""The Masque of the Red Death.""  He delivers a great performance as one of the most despicable, evil villains of his career, Prince Prospero.  While the Red Death rages throughout the countryside, killing most everyone in its wake, the heartless, merciless, Satan worshipping Prince Prospero takes refuge in his mighty fortress.  Roger Corman spent more money and time producing this film than he did on any of the other versions of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, and it definitely shows.  The settings and costumes are extravagant.

  ""The Masque of the Red Death"" is one of the most violent of the Price movies I've seen.  Never a dull moment.  Prince Prospero thinks that he can escape death, but no one can.  In the end, death finds Prince Prospero.

  In ""The Premature Burial,"" another man, Ray Milland, tries to escape death but can't.  Originally, Vincent Price was suppose to play Milland's role but couldn't because he had an exclusive contract with AIP.  (Later, Pathe, which owned ""The Premature Burial,"" was bought by AIP.)  I'm glad Price couldn't; he was always better at playing the villain than he was the tormented hero.

  Milland is Guy Carrell who has an unhealthy obsession about being buried alive - an obsession that grows into madness.  Not as lavish and extravagant a production as ""Masque of the Red Death,"" ""The Premature Burial"" is, however, very entertaining.  The body count is low compared to ""Masque,"" but it becomes very violent towards the end.  However, it is more gothic than ""Masque.""  Corman used the lightning and fog machines quite liberally throughout the film.

  The buxom beauty, Hazel Court, is in both movies.  Her diverse roles prove what a wonderful actress she was.

  This double feature from MGM is a must have for fans of Vincent Price, fans of gothic horror, and fans of good classic horror cinema.  Each movie will make you ponder your own death long after you've seen it.",1210118400,2,1967,4.905487804878049
1726964,4,B000068TPE,"A two-in-one pairing in which one half of the bill clearly overwhelms the other, with 'The Premature Burial' a decent film that fans of this era of horror will want to watch, and with 'The Masque Of The Red Death' as the real must-see.

  In 'Masque Of The Red Death', the red death plague is ravaging the medieval countryside, and people are looking for refuge wherever they can.  A trio of peasants - a young couple and the girl's father - wind up taking shelter at the grand castle of Prospero (Vincent Price, in one of his alltime greatest roles), a twisted despot.  In this palace where Prospero and a host of unlikable nobles - all ruled over with an iron fist by Prospero - have squestered themselves in comfort against the ravages of the plague, the trio becomes Prospero's prisoners.  The lord of the castle is a cruel master with a warped sense of humor.  Among the most intriguing angles of the movie is the strange relationship that develops between Prospero and the 'peasant girl' Francessca (Jane Asher).  Francessca is a courageous and compassionate girl, with a real nobility that the barons and aristocrats in the castle only have title to.  As her spirit fails to falter or change, Prospero seems increasingly fascinated by her.  He seems to develop a respect and affection for her - not neccessarily a romantic affection, but perhaps something more like an uncle or even a father.  But being unfamiliar with either respect or love (fatherly or otherwise) Prospero doesn't quite seem to recognize the feelings, and is thus made all the more curious.  The supernatural elements of the movie enter at the great masquerade ball the castle's master stages and orders everyone to attend, and certainly put forward some unusual notions.  Masque Of The Red Death is captivating, atmospheric, not at all campy, and makes outstanding use of color, music and production design.

  'The Premature Burial' is one of Roger Corman's few horror entries not to star Price, instead featuring Ray Milland in the lead role as a man so obsessed with a fear of being buried alive that he constructs a special crypt and coffin designed for escape should that fate ever befall him.  Of course, an unexpected monkeywrench ends up being thrown into the whole plan.  With talented people on both sides of the camera and with a solid idea behind it, this probably should have been better, but it was one of those cases where things didn't click and the whole ended up being less than the sum of its parts.  It's an alright watch; though it was filmed in 1962 it may appeal more strongly to fans of horror and suspense from a decade or more earlier - actually probably more to suspense fans because its hold on its status as a horror movie is somewhat tenuous.

  Overall the disc offers one of the most essential horror movies from the 1960s in Masque and a good bonus in Burial.  A definate pick for fans of Price/Corman/Poe or of similar horror from the era, like Hammer's movies.",1204243200,3,2973,4.707930367504836
1726965,5,B000068TPE,"Roger Corman may not be known for his Oscar caliber movies, but if there's one thing he SHOULD be known for, its his film adaptions of Edgar Allen Poe stories. This two-film DVD features two great examples.

Starring Vincent Price, ""The Masque of the Red Death"" is probably the best of the Corman Poe adaptions. The story begins with an elderly woman out gathering wood. The woman comes in contact with a mysterious man clothed all in red who gives her a beautiful red rose to take back to the village.

Price stars as the evil Prince Prospero, a nobleman not known for his kindness and compassion. During Prospero's visit to the villageto ""thank"" the citizens for their ""donated"" crops, he finds that many are unhappy with his actions. Two men are taken into custody to be imprisoned at the palace having offended Prospero by confronting him for his cruelty. Unfortunately, their actions cause the prince to come into contact with the lovely Francesca. Just as Prospero prepares to kill the men, one of whom is Francesca's father, the other her betrothed, screams draw the attention of all to the home of the old woman who is found covered with red spots and blood, dead of the red death.

Prospero drags Francesca and the men in her life back to the palace which is then sealed off from all who pass through the village. Only Prospero's friends and cronies are given refuge from the impending epidemic.

But Prospero's ties to Satan soon turn on him and he finds his palace to be a prison from which he cannot escape.

Corman uses color exquisitely in this movie, with the costumes, sets and even actors fitting into the gothic palette he has created. In one particularly memorable sequence, Prospero's former lover becomes the bride of Satan, branding her breast with an upside down cross. When she seals the deal with a drink of some unknown brew, she is thrown into a nightmare in which she suffers as sacrifice to some of the more blood thirsty religions in history.

""Masque of the Red Death"" is one of the best examples of Corman's Poe films. And while it doesn't stick to the original story much (none of the Poe films do) the storyline is very well done. The acting is very good and Price is fantastic as yet another evil man bent on enjoying the darker side of the world.

There are some pretty disturbing scenes which make this movie one I don't recommend for younger children. And there is some reference to deviant sexual behaviors. But there are really no actual sex scenes in the film. Corman uses innuendo and suggestions to get the point across without resorting to images of bare breasts and behinds to titillate the audience.

This movie is perfect for a late night horror fest when you're looking for something older children (say 10 and up) can watch to get scared without showing them anything raunchy.

For horror fans, this movie is an example of how a movie maker can use sets, story and acting to achieve horrifying results without having to go for the gross out or the boob shot.

The movie shows the disparities of medeival society, and you get a feel for how the rich were just slaves to their senses.  Vincent Price is wonderful as the evil (by choice) Prince Prospero, and it is good to see him get what happens in the end.

Perhaps it is the use of the Bava-like colours(especially cool are the various ""Angels of Death"" that appear) and the superior music(check out the closing credits....even THEY are exciting!) I don't know how Roger Corman ended up making this(not to denigrate him, but this movie is so masterful and artistic it can not even be compared to most of his other output!)  It creates a claustrophobic atmos-fear of building tension as well as madness and IMPENDING DOOM...I've read about that with other films, but this is one of the few(along with Kubrick's ""Shining"", of course) that actually delivers that.  In my opinion, THE best adaptation, by Corman or anyone else, of Poe(Corman also does a great job adapting Lovecraft in the Poe-titled ""The Haunted Palace"", which is actually Lovecraft's ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"") ""Masque"" survives as a beautiful, dream-like, creepy film......""it is time for a NEW dance to begin: The Dance of DEATH""! launches an eerie ""dance number"" that certainly does NOT include Gene Kelley or any crummy animated penguins!",1175385600,3,1610,5.071969696969697

""The Premature Burial"" is a decent enough film with moments of great creepiness, however the real gem in this affordable package is undoubtedly ""The Masque of the Red Death"" Both are Roger Corman features based on Edgar Allan Poe tales, but while the first is just some diverting fun, the second may be Corman and Price's best work ever.

From art design to lavish costumes to the effectively designed period sets, Corman took a creative chance on this one. He experimented with a more strikingly visual and abstract style of film making and the result is impressive.  Don't worry though.  This is by no means an art film or some intellectual exercise in philosophy empty of visceral delights.  It's still an effective thriller that can compete with any standard shocker.  However, the depth of plot and sophisticated character development is most evident here.  As for the more art house approach, Corman has said that the great European film director Ingmar Berman was a definite influence in his style for the piece.

Vincent Price's villainous Prospero leads a wonderful cast of actors through a richly portrayed and unforgettable story courtesy of Charles Beaumont's enhancing of the classic Poe tale.

1727000,4,B000068TPE,"This double-sided DVD brings together two of the seven Edgar Allen Poe adaptations that Roger Corman made in the early 1960s for American International (1963's ""The Haunted Palace"" uses the title of a poem by Poe for the title but is really based on a H.P. Lovecraft story, so it does not count as one of the series as far as I am concerned).  The result is a decent enough double-bill of only American movies that were giving the Hammer gothic revival any real competition.

For ""The Masque of the Red Death,"" Corman had the advantage of Charles Beaumont, one of the scripters from ""The Twilight Zone"" who also wrote ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"" and science fiction author R. Wright Campbell, doing the adaptation for this 1964 film.  What you have to keep in mind is that Poe's originally tale is barely long enough to be considered a short story in the first place, but it is a neat title and it did have a pretty good twist.  Beaumont and Campbell come up with an elaborate story to set up how it is that the Red Death attends Prospero's masque.  One of the things they did was incorporate ""Hop-Frog,"" another Poe story, but another is to turn Prospero and his sister in worshippers of Satan (reformed, apparently, compared to what we would see from other Hollywood films such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the next decade).

When young Francesca (Jane Asher, Paul McCartney's muse in the early 1960s when he was writing songs for her older brother Peter of Peter & Gordon) begs for the lives of her father (Nigel Green) and Gino (David Weston), the young man she loves, Count Prospero (Vincent Price) tells her she can choose who will live and who must die.  However, that is just a prelude to the main part of the film where Prospero and his court and holed up in his castle.  The Red Death is spreading around the countryside and Prospero needs to find ways to keep himself amused.  The result is a series of sadistic games and actions at Prospero's order.  Meanwhile, a hooded figure in red comes to pay a visit.

Corman remade ""The Masque of Red Death"" in 1989, but he should not have bothered, because this is the better version.  This is arguably the best looking of the Corman films and when you see some of these interior sets you can only marvel at how far Corman has come from the days of making movies quick and dirty for no money (the fact Corman was shooting in Britain for the first time had a lot to do with it as did the fact that they simply used the sets from ""Becket"").  Price gets to be relatively restrained, even when he is ordering people garroted or tossing a woman a dagger so she can kill herself, and this one ends with an appropriate whimper.  But I think the best performance comes from Skip Martin as Hop Toad, who does a lot with the similarly sadistic subplot of this one.

""The Premature Burial"" was made in 1962 and stars Ray Milland instead of Vincent Price.  Emily Gault (Hazel Court) demands to know why Guy Carrell (Miland) has called off their engagement.  Guy explains that ever since their discovered his father had been buried alive, he has been terrified the same thing will happen to him because he might also suffer from catalepsy.  Emily and Miles Archer (Richard Ney), convince Guy to go along with the marriage, but he becomes so worried about premature burial that he even builds a special tomb that will allow him to escape.  If you do not know that Guy's worst dreams are going to come true, then you are just not paying attention.

That is because the screenplay by Charles Beaumont and Ray Russell (who would script ""X - The Man with X-Ray Eyes"" for Corman and Milland) works in the idea that Guy's fear can be taken advantage of by someone who is after his money or his wife (or both).  So Guy's fate has to do with more than the Fates really sticking it to him.  This is a relatively short film (81 minutes), but it seems to drag a bit because it takes its time getting to what we all know is going to happen.  The best scene comes when Emily tells Guy that he is so obsessed with his fears that for all intents and purposes he is dead already.  But the ending is devoted way too much to telling the audience rather than showing us and ends the film on a down note.

The special features are limited to the trailers for the two films and a pair of featurettes in which Corman talks about each film, ""Roger Corman Unearths 'The Premature Burial'"" and ""'Masque of the Red Death': Roger Corman Behind the Masque.""  There are some interesting insights into the films and you learn how it was that Milland ended up in the only Poe film Corman did for A.I. without Price.  The first movie is a solid four and the second is at least a star below that, but the interviews with Corman are enough to justify rounding up.",1117411200,2,4765,4.428407789232532
1727001,5,B000068TPE,"Undoubtedly the 1964 film 'The Masque of the Red Death'stands as Roger Corman's masterpiece of richly-stylized gothic horror, melding his free adaptation of the Poe story of the same name with the cruel tale of 'Hop Frog'. The atmosphere acheived in this film , with it's sumptuous sets, costumery and heightened sense of lapidary colour, is quite incomparable. From the opening scene in the mist-shrouded twilight of the plague-haunted mediaeval countryside where the old woman gathering wood encounters the crimson-cowled figure of the Red Death sat beneath a tree drawing the tarot cards which signify his role as divinely-appointed dispenser of fate unto humankind, an eerie and apocalyptic drama unfolds to compelling effect: the simplicity and innocence of the village-girl Francesca contrasts sharply with the luxuriant and corrupting evil within Prince Prospero's turreted castle as a tale as starkly and boldly delineated as some Mystery-cycle or morality-play of the High Middle Ages, is enacted. Vincent Price's depiction of Prince Prospero, a nobleman who has pledged his eternal soul to the Lord of this World, the 'Lord of Flies', is absolutely masterly. Likewise the beautiful Hazel Court provides a powerful portrayal of Juliana who vies with Prospero for the infernal favours of Satan vowing herself as the bride of hell in the black chapel. Sin and innocence, sanctity and abomination, freedom and fate, survival and mortality  - all is in the balance and over all the red-cowled figure of the Red Death presides dealing the cards which are the lots of inexorable and inescapable destiny. Prince Prospero's dark allegiance and pact with his satanic Master avails him not at all when the clock strikes midnight and despite his arrogant pomp, power and riches he too must join in the final dance - the Dance of Death!

  The sheer visual beauty of many scenes of this film will impress themselves vividly upon your imagination in a lasting way, some examples being the suite of yellow, blue, purple and black chambers, Juliana's hallucinatory and daemonic dream sequence and the final sequence where the various avatars of Death are beheld upon the foggy heath. The acting is of a very high standard and the characters are well realised throughout. The pace never flags as the narative builds up via skilful episodic unfoldment to the climactic confrontation at the height of the Masque and the score throughout is powerful and deeply evocative. 'The Masque of the Red Death' delivers an unforgettable experience and is truly worthy of being called a genuine classic of horror...",1093564800,14,2595,5.186157517899761

1727003,4,B000068TPE,"MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH (4 stars)
This Poe adaptation, inspired by ""Hop Frog"" is one of Roger Corman's most creative & artistically satisfying films. Shot in only five weeks, MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH sees Vincent Price giving one of his all time greatest performances as the evil Prince Prospero, a man who blames God for all that is evil in the world & has sought refuge in satanism. Prospero is such a likable fellow that he has the father of his mistress Francesca (June Asher)- ironically a redhead- & her lover quartered. But unknown to Prospero his legal wife Julianna (Hazel Court) has branded an inverted crucifix into her chest & has made a pledge to become the bride of Satan! A smart move considering it is almost the sabbath...
To celebrate the upcoming witches sabbath, Prospero decides to throw an elaborate masquerade ball  - though guests are forbidden to wear red because of the plague of red death  sweeping the countryside & ravaging the peasants in the village below. But on this night Prospero is to pay dearly for his villainy....
Featuring excellent production design by Daniel Heller & photography by Nicholas Roeg, MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH ranks alongside HOUSE OF WAX & THEATER OF BLOOD as one of Price's very best genre films.
PREMATURE BURIAL (2 1/2 STARS)
In this rather below par entry in Corman's Poe cycle scripted by Charles Beaumont and Ray Russell, Ray Milland plays Guy, a medical student with a fear of being buried alive. Each member of his family has died unpleasant deaths, beginning with his father having a coronary when Guy was 13. Guy regularly hears his father screaming out from beyond the grave, but his wife Emily (Hazel Court again) tries to convince him his fears are all in the mind, and that he's slowly going mad.
Sadly, the viewer may feel similarly.
The movies most memorable scene involves maggots writhing out of a silver chalice; but for the most part THE PREMATURE BURIAL is a stodgily paced, long-winded bore- until the fun finale and twist ending. Corman fans will want to check it out, but this is far from being his best work. It will come as no surprise that Vincent Price was originally intended to play Guy, but he was under contract to another studio at the time. It would have been interesting to see how much better the movie could have been with his magic touch. But generally, this Double Feature is well worth a look. Extras include trailers for both movies and couple of (very) brief interviews with Corman.",1075939200,5,2478,4.694252873563219
1727014,4,B000068TPE,"One of the most interesting benefits of this double bill is the commentary by legendary producer/director Roger Corman who helmed all the Poe films made by American International.  He adds some great insight into the behind the scenes mechanics, including the ironic necessity to put Ray Milland in the lead in ""Premature Burial"" due to contractual requirements.  It's ironic in that American International bought Pathe Studios and released the ""Burial"" anyway!
Both movies are sumptuously filmed, the budget an obvious factor in the supremely photographed ""Masque"".  Note the script's dependence on the belief of a God who would let terrible things happen.  Also enjoy Price's masterful portrayal of Prospero; Hazel Court's brief stay as the inimitable Juliana (Hazel was a beautiful woman--wonder why we didn't see more of her in later films?); also enjoy the subtly intriguing performance of Patrick Magee as the lecherous ""gorilla.""  ""Don't Look Now's"" director Nicolas Roeg was the cinematographer and he does a magnificent job in utilizing the various moods of the film.
I always wondered why Ray Milland got the role in ""Burial"" and after the commentary by Corman, I finally understood.  Not that Ray isn't a good actor; he is.  I felt,however, that he was not a good choice for the role of Guy Carnall.  He didn't hurt the movie, but I felt he didn't display the wide array of emotions the character was screaming for.  Hazel Court is back in a much bigger role and she gets fine help from Heather Angel and Richard Ney as well.  It's slower paced than ""Masque"" but it maintains a spooky, claustrophobic feel and does well overall.
Thanks to Midnight Movies for bringing us these classic in DVD.  The transfer on both is excellent.  They don't look old at all.",1071446400,4,1768,4.976190476190476
1727015,5,B000068TPE,"Vincent Price is in great form as the evil Prince Prospero holding sway in his castle while the Red Death ravages the countryside in this 1964 classic. He has his pick of who joins him there and who perishes in the plague. Joining him in his depraved revelries and satanic practices is his Lady---Juliana (the luscious Hazel Court) who may be wearing out her tenure. Prospero has forced an innocent village girl (Jane Asher) to join him in hopes of converting her to satanism and instructs a resentful Juliana to groom her. He has also imprisoned the girl's lover and father in his torture dungeon. Prospero is planning a huge masked ball to celebrate his ""triumph"" over the Red Death and has assembled his most faithful gluttonous followers in the castle. But Death is not so easily tricked. Probably the most famous of AIP's Price/Corman/Poe adaptations is notable for the great Nicolas Roeg photography and the brilliant use of color throughout as well as a couple of nods to Ingmar Bergman. Outstanding script by Charles Beaumont and R.Wright Campbell make this one of the most literate horror films from the Poe cycle as well. A MUST see for any horror buff. Also included is 1962's ""The Premature Burial"" which is sorely lacking Price (in the role played by Ray Milland) as a man obsessed with being buried alive. He has built a specially equipped crypt designed to prevent this from happening. Lavishly mounted, with Hazel Court as his duplicitous fiancee, ""Burial"" looks good and benefits from foggy sets and the haunting tune ""Waltzing Matilda"" sung by gravediggers but I found myself wishing Price had the lead instead of Milland. But whatever, I enjoyed it anyway. Great looking DVD package of two AIP/Arkoff/Nicholson treats and a must for fans of the great 60's Poe cycle.",1063670400,,1785,4.875
1727016,5,B000068TPE,"Two great films for the price of one!

Masque of the Red Death, another in the Corman-Poe-Price series from American International, is considered by many to be among the best of the series. Great sets, vivid color, creepy story - all the elements are in play here. The DVD features a very clean print and a bonus documentary with the fascinating Roger Corman. Well worth the price MGM is charging, you should also pick up ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""Pit and the Pendulum,"" just some of the other AIP films available through this series.

Premature Burial, a Ray Milland vehicle directed by Corman, is about a man who is terrified to be buried alive. It isn't great, but it is solid nontheless, eminently viewable, with the signature gothic atmosphere that will delight fans of the Poe series. There is a Corman documentary for this one, too. If you like Milland, look for ""X - The Man with the X-ray Eyes"", ""The Thing with Two Heads"", ""Frogs"", and ""The Attic"".",1061769600,2,970,4.601156069364162
1727017,3,B000068TPE,"Masque of the Red Death...this was one of Roger Corman's more lavish AIP productions.  This one benefited from more money, accessibility to great scenery, and a great location.  As with most of Corman's Poe movies, there is a good amount that's speculated from Poe's original story, as they were usually pretty short, at least not enough material to fill out a hour and a half movie.  Vincent Price plays Prince Prospero, a satanic nobleman with a penchant for cruelty, especially with regards to the peasants within his realm.  On discovering that the red death has been found within the small village he oversees, he orders it to be burnt to the ground.  He then also invites the local nobility to his castle for protection against the red death, and they proceed to envelope themselves in depravity and much debauchery.  Watch for some great performances by Patrick Magee as Alfredo, Hazel Court as Juliana and Jane Asher as Francesca.  The dream sequence with Juliana was really done well, similar to the dream sequence with Ray Milland in Premature Burial.  Ultimately, the carrier of the red death comes to the castle during a masquerade, and Prospero assumes it's his unholy master, but soon learns otherwise.  There is a side story, one with a peasant girl, Francesca, played by Jane Asher.  Prince Prospero spares her when he has her village destroyed, and seems to be intrigued by her innocence, her purity and his need to corrupt her to gain favor with his master.  A great production, and a great performance by Vincent Price.  One part I found especially creepy was that little girl that they made to appear as a little woman through makeup and such.  And then dubbing in an adult's voice when she spoke...The one problem I did have with this movie was it was almost too lavish.  In particular, Prince Prospero has a number of rooms linked together, and each is painted a different color, a somewhat gaudy color.  And it's not just the room, but all the furnishings in the room are the same color.  One room is an ugly yellow, and then through the door is another room is exacly the same, yet purple and so on...the last room was black, and was supposed to be his sort of satanic temple.  But I digress...this was a fairly small bone for me to pick on, but I think Trading Spaces would have had a field day with this place.
And on the flipside we get Premature Burial.  Apparently, Roger Corman had some kind of minor falling out with AIP, and decided to make this movie without AIP.  He approached Pathe, which did color for the movies, and they showed interest in backing Corman on this movie, as they wanted to get into film distribution.  Well, things moved on from there, and the cast was set, and then AIP bought Pathe, making it a AIP production in the end.  The only reason I mention this is because Ray Milland, not Vincent Price stars in this movie.  Vincent Price had been under contact with AIP, so when Roger Corman wanted to cast the movie, he was unable to get Vincent as the star.  Some say the movie suffers from this, but I disagree.  I think Vincent Price was an amazing actor, but I really enjoyed Ray Milland in the lead role.  Ray plays Guy Carrell, a man obsessed with being buried alive.  In the basement of his manor, there are tombs where his family members are interred.  When he was young, his father passed away, but Guy thinks his father wasn't really dead, and claims to have heard him trying to escape.  Apparently his father had a disease that could present the appearance of death, even when the person wasn't really dead.  Guy's fear of being buried alive stems from this.  His fear is so great he builds a crypt, complete with numerous escape routes should he ever suffer the same fate.  His thoughts of death and being buried alive consume him, and so his relationship with his new wife suffers.  Hazel Court plays Emily, his wife, and she thinks he's suffering from a sickness of the mind, his being so pre-occupied with the subject and she tries to get help from the family physician.  She finally convinces Guy to destroy his crypt and try to live a normal life.  I have to say, I thought his crypt was pretty cool, and he seemed to have thought of everything.  It kind of reminded me of those bomb shelters people built in the 50's in case of nuclear attack.  Anyhow, Guy has an attack, brought on by trying to prove his father didn't die as he thought, and goes into a comatose death-like state and his worst fear comes to reality, that of being buried alive!  He manages to escape, and learns of plans by others to hasten his demise and begins to set things right.  A pretty decent entry, although I saw the ending coming from about halfway into the movie.  An red herring was offered to us in who was responsible for the odd goings on, the little things intended to fuel his fears, but it was presented in such a way it was so obvious that it couldn't be true.  That was probably my biggest problem with this movie, and I tried not to give anything away in illustrating it.  The dream/nightmare sequence was quite good, and filmed very similar to the dream sequence in Masque of the Red Death.  I guess if something works, stick with it.  I really enjoyed Ray Milland in this movie, a man ruled by his obsession with premature burial.  Was this a common problem back in the day?  There was rationalization presented to support his fear, but I guess most everyone has to fear something, although premature burial is pretty low on my list.",1058227200,17,5494,4.555555555555555

1727019,5,B000068TPE,"MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, 7th in the series of Corman's Poe pictures, is a lurid, ambitious little masterpiece of low-budget film-making. A taut, intelligent script (by Twilight Zone's Charles Beaumont), splendid medieval sets, clever dialogue and strong acting in the leads (Vincent Price, Hazel Court, and Patrick Magee), makes this film shine.
 MASQUE has more in common with Bergman's SEVENTH SEAL than, say, another Corman quickie like LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. Price's Prospero is a delightful Sadeian lord (a much truer picture of this type of character than Geoffrey Rush in the Sade biopic QUILLS). Prospero elaborates his philosophy of satanic cruelty, a pleasure he indulges in with calculating coldness and rationality, to the the young Francesca, a kidnapped peasant girl trying to save her imprisoned brother and father. He and Magee wish to pursue evil and befoul innocence, to tear it from its lofty perch and show it the world as it is: vicious, harsh, unforgiving, the Christian God murdered. Heavy stuff!
Yes, there are ideas in this flick, if you wish to look; or, you can just curl up and enjoy a horror classic that's no guilty pleasure. As for PREMATURE BURIAL, well, despite the cool tomb Ray Milland has set up for himself and some creepy, fog-enshrouded moors, it rates only about 2-and-a-half stars.

""The Premature Burial"" is the more involving of the two, but ""The Masque of the Red Death"" is the more complex and artful.

Sure, it is one of Roger Corman's most elaborate productions, but the story outright stinks. Vincent Price, as he does in all of the Corman adaptations of Edgar Allen Poe stories he stars in, shines, this time as the evil Prince Prospero. However, the plot line is convoluted and really doesn't make sense. Prospero, a devil worshipper and murderer, hides from the Red Death in his castle with other members of the dark ages' privileged upper crust while the poor villagers succumb to the disease. Cosmetically, the picture is superb, but like I said, the storyline is contrived. The Premature Burial with Ray Milland in the lead at least has an interesting plot that makes sense. Although this movie isn't as aesthitically pleasing to the eye as Masque, it is certainly more respectable. The DVD rendiions of these two films are great and MGM deserves credit for that. However, if you want to see a good Roger Corman movie, get a copy of The Pit and the Pendulum. It's a masterpiece of the macabre.",1039651200,3,1170,4.740196078431373

1727023,3,B000068TPE,"Roger Corman's Poe adaptions are only as good as the writer he's working with on them. Most of Corman's Poe films were scripted by writing wiz Richard Matheson. While these films were a bit flatfooted when it comes to the cinematography, they had their charms and Vincent Price made the films come alive with his performances.
Masque of the Red Death is probably Corman's richest film visually but the mannered staging of many of the scenes gets in the way of some fine performances and powerful scenes. Charles Beaumont's adaption of two Poe stories manages to create a memorable story about wealth, status and the corruption of power. Price gives a delicious performance and Jane Asher is memorable as the female lead.
The ""dance"" of death is a bit too stylized and distracting. Although it might have been considered arty and daring for its time (and genre), Masque isn't the masterpiece many Corman fans lead you to believe.
Premature Burial, on the other hand, is an underrated gem. The script isn't quite as tight or well written as Masque but the performances and direction are more consistent. Ray Milland steps in for Vincent Price (who wasn't able to star due to his contract with AIP. Ironically, AIP eventually picked up the distribution rights to Burial). Milland might seem an odd choice for the main character at first, but he pulls it off quite well. His nervous and distracted acting style suits the main character in this film. Although not as visually memorable or stunning as Masque, Burial is a more consistently enjoyable film.

On the laser you can see (if you slo-mo it) that she's actually wearing a ""bathing suit"" that matches her skin tone. I may be splitting hairs, but that quick shot adds just a bit of adrenalin to the scene. It also makes her character seem more vulnerable to the evil Prospero. Now WHY did MGM cut this scene?

1727053,3,B000068TPE,"Call me old-fashioned, but whenever I revisit a pair of A.I.P. Poe Classics like MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH & THE PREMATURE BURIAL, there are plenty of similarities that might have been missed 40 years ago!  Like many of you, I saw both of these in a movie theatre (back in the 60s) and enjoyed the atmospheric quality, the music and the occasional scares.  Those 'quick character cuts' married with Ronald Stein's music always made the pictures seem creepier than they actually were!  Corman's dream sequences were probably the strongest part of all of the Poe films that he directed. On this DVD, there are two short interviews with Roger where he explains how he managed to give these films an ""A"" quality look. With the use of excellent camera work (by Floyd Crosby) along with recycled sets from films like ""BECKET"", Corman definitely went beyond his ""B"" picture budget! In both of these movies, you also get to watch Hazel Court..an excellent under-rated actress..get her comeuppance.  She has a dream sequence with four demons in MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, which ultimately leads to her demise by an angry raven!  In THE PREMATURE BURIAL, her phony devotion to her husband (played by Ray Milland) turns into an exercise of being buried alive! [Hopefully--MIDNITE MOVIES will eventually release the 1963 version of THE RAVEN where Court has great chemistry with Boris Karloff, Vincent Price and Peter Lorre).  All in all, the idea of pairing these two A.I.P. classics together is interesting.  Purists will probably hate PREMATURE BURIAL in favor of MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, but there are strong points in both.  Hopefully, you've got a good monitor or television set capable of bringing out the color on these?  I noticed that both films looked somewhat dark on a bad TV monitor!  Fortunately, the transfers were done in letterbox so you get to see ALL of the scenes with ALL of the cast members. (Local TV stations who used to run these would usually show full flat prints eliminating cast members, or at least part of their bodies).  How about formatting more of these DVD double-features?

1727054,4,B000068TPE,"This disc features two of shocksploitation director Roger Corman's infamous Edgar Allan Poe adaptations: _Masque of the Red Death_ and _The Premature Burial_.  As adaptations of Poe, they completely miss the mark, distorting his tales into simple morality plays.  But at least one of these films succeeds very well on its own terms, and, for fans of early-'60s exploitation horror, is definitely worth the purchase price.
_Burial_, a tired little chiller featuring a tired Ray Milland (but, sadly, no Vincent Price), ought to have been buried even sooner.  The less said about it, the better.  However, with _Red Death_ (starring Price in one of his most outlandish performances), we have one of Corman's most elaborate films.  It's a wicked delight from start to finish.
In _Red Death_ Corman has his best cast ever, cavernous sets, experimental visuals, a bigger budget and a worthy script.  The film's Bergmanesque flourishes are laughable, but as with most of Corman's work the laugh is good-natured -- as much on us as on him.  That said, the story manages to generate considerable tension, and Nicholas Roeg's cinematography adds flair to Corman's meat-and-potatoes visuals.
As one might expect from a bargain-priced two-fer, the extras aren't exactly legion.  But what's here, as they say, is ""cherce.""  For each film, Corman gives a generous interview, and offers pleasant tidbits about the production.  Video and audio transfers are acceptable, except for one massive print flaw at the climax of _Red Death_.  Corman's films haven't exactly been handled with care, so we probably won't see them in better condition than here.

1727055,4,B000068TPE,"Roger Corman has been associated with a lot of bad, low-budget movies.  His movie-making peak, however, came with his often high-quality Poe adaptations.  On this disc, we get two such movies, one that is great, one that is merely passable.
The Masque of the Red Death is the great movie.  Starring Vincent Price as the deliciously evil Prince Prospero, this movie takes place in medieval Italy.  Prospero, a dedicated Satan-worshipper, has invited all the local gentry to his castle to take refuge from a plague called the Red Death that is sweeping throughout the countryside.  Price is fantastic as he relishes his evil deeds and tries to seduce a young Christian woman; he is a formidable fellow who is intimidated by almost nothing.
This is a distinct difference from Ray Milland's lead character in the Premature Burial.  Milland's protagonist is obsessed with a fear of being buried alive...to the point where he is one-dimensionally boring.  The only thing that redeems this movie is a wonderfully creepy dream sequence.  Milland has none of the delightful campiness of Price, and this movie suffers from Corman's inability to cast his usual Poe-movie star.
The Masque of the Red Death rates around four-and-a-half stars, the Premature Burial maybe two-and-a-half.  Add to this average some nice ten minute documentaries on each movie, and this disc rates four stars.  My recommendation:  watch them both, watching each documentary afterwards...but watch the Masque of the Red Death second, and enjoy it like a good dessert after a somewhat tasteless meal.",1032912000,10,1564,5.166666666666667
1727056,4,B000068TPE,"MGM has released Roger Corman's ""Masque of the Red Death""  as half of a Midnite Movies double feature with ""The Premature Burial,"" both presented in widescreen. They're introduced by the avuncular Corman, whose memory seems extraordinary. The prolific filmmaker calls ""Masque"" one of his best works.
""Masque"" stars Vincent Price, while ""Burial"" digs in with Ray Milland. Corman delights in both stars, noting that Price benefited from his exotic appearance, while Milland found menace behind the matinee-idol look. Price, he says, thrived in the horror game because he took his work deadly seriously.
Corman says ""Masque"" was his first choice for a Poe project when AIP began the series, but he waited, fearing comparisons to the robed Death in ""The Seventh Seal."" Corman says Ingmar Bergman's icy classic did in fact influence the look of the film, along with Hitchcock and the German Expressionists.
""Masque"" was shot in London in order to take advantage of tax breaks. Sets recycled from ""Beckett"" gave it a bigger-budget feel. Roeg elevated the movie with some of his best camerawork, all bold colors and movement, wonderfully lit. The video leaves a rich impression, but there are persistent signs of age and obvious splice marks. Audio is good enough.
While ""Masque's"" story of the plague years has resonance in the time of AIDS, ""Premature Burial"" seems a bit mannered considering its horrific subject matter. Still, the movie leaves viewers with material for many a nightmare. Video and audio are OK.",1032825600,6,1508,5.155102040816327
1727057,5,B000068TPE,"Finally!  A mystery has been solved.  I saw MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH when I was a kid and it made a lasting impression on me.  However, as an adult I could not remember which Vincent Price/Roger Corman movie had affected me so much.  I recently purchased HOUSE OF USHER, hoping that it was the movie I remembered.  It wasn't. (And it's a slow, inferior film compared to MASQUE).
So, I sat down and watched MASQUE this weekend and as soon as I saw the mysterious man in the red cloak, I knew I had found the film from my childhood.  What had impressed me so much?  I remembered two things:  the men in multi-colored cloaks at the end of the film.  And the sets:  there were rooms in the castle that were decorated in one color scheme.
This is an awesome film!  It walks a fine line and succeeds in so many ways.  The line it walks is the line between cheesiness and sumptuousness; macabre and camp; sexiness and tastefulness.  The rooms I remembered were there!  And gorgeous!  There is a yellow, purple, white, and black room.  The mysterious cloaked men show up in the last scene.  And there is a subplot with a dwarf character named Hop Toad that I had completely forgotten about.
Some scenes are hilarious - for instance, Hop Toad's girlfriend is a dancer and meant to be another little person.  But director Corman could not find an appropriate actress so he cast a young girl.  However, an older, sultrier actress dubs her voice.  So it's very funny to see this little girl speak and sound like Kathleen Turner.
The sets and costumes are sumptuous, though.  The script is very good.  The print of the film used for the DVD looks very good to my eyes, although a couple of splices/tears are very obvious (especially in the climax as Price walks up the stairs to face the man in red -- a big splice tears across the screen.  E[...])
It's nice to see MASQUE after all these years.  I haven't watched the second feature on this disk yet.  To me, it's simply a bonus since MASQUE was so pleasing to watch.",1031529600,5,2004,4.409836065573771
1727058,5,B000068TPE,"This is MGM at their best.  A double-feature DVD with two Roger Corman classics, both in glorius widescreen, both in luscious technicolor.  The first gem, ""Masque of the Red Death"", has never looked better.  A tale of decadence set during the black plague, here represented as the ""red plague"", thus Edgar Allen Poe.  But where Poes wonderful poem ends, is, so-to-speak, at the end of this film.  Corman took Poes frightening vignette on the black death and spun a tale of Satanism versus Christain belief, all set in a richly atmospheric castle in the middle of a hellish landscape -- For those of you squemish about anything to do with Christianity, think of it as a morality play of Good against Evil; afterall, Corman is rather ambiguous as to who the hooded ""death characters"" really are -- And our host to the party to end all parties, none other than Vincent Price himself.
The second film, Premature Burial, I'd never seen until this DVD.  It is not as hypnotic at ""Masque"", but it is a fun, macabre journey into madness with a superb actor, Ray Milland, at the helm.  Also starring the very sexy, very voluptious Hazel Court, which some Hammer Horror fans may remember from the up and coming dvd ""Curse of Frankenstein"", due out in October.  The film is presented in widescreen.  Both films, one on each side of the DVD, include very nicely produced extras with Roger Corman, giving some nice information on the creation and production of both films.  If your a fan of Vincent Price, buy it for ""Masque"".  If your a fan of Roger Corman, you will not be disapointed in either film.",1031270400,17,1589,4.659498207885305
1727059,5,B000068TPE,"I just bought this double-movie DVD and am most impressed. The films, themselves, are entertaining, but the greatest feature is that on each film, Corman has an interview describing his motivations regarding each film. This in itself is wonderful, as I've always admired Corman...indeed, he is one of our finest to create a substantial body of work as somewhat of an ""indpendent"", not relying on studio politics. I found his observations as riveting as the films themselves. FOR EXAMPLE: I always wondered why ""The Premature Burial"" starred Ray Milland instead of Price. Corman explains that he wanted this as an independent break from AIP, and Price was under contract with AIP. That it was ultimately made by AIP is another interesting point (see for yourself). ALSO: Floyd Crosby was the cinematographer for most of Corman's Poe films; he was ruined by the McCarthy witch-hunt, though an oft-decorated war hero, and Corman didn't care. All he saw here was a talented photographer. ALSO: He tried out a new and up-coming cinematographer for ""Masque"", the wonderful Nicholas Roeg, whose reputation now speaks for itself. ALSO: ""Masque"" was supposed to be the second in the Poe series, but Corman's favorite and most-admired director, Ingmar Bergman, had just released ""The Seventh Seal"", and Corman thought there might be comparisons. I don't want to tell you too much about these wonderful interviews with Corman, but I would recommend you watch these before each film. The insight is most profound. ""The Premature Burial"" has never been released on VHS or DVD, so this is a first. The transfer is excellent, and the use of color is quite stunning...the reddist reds, deepest browns, and the usual Corman eeriness, i.e., lots of fog. I liked this one, though it was never my favorite of the Poe films. It's definitely worth your attention, with a twist ending. ""Masque"" is one of Corman's most admired Poe films. Corman admits that it's the only screenplay that required re-writes, adding the ""Hop-Toad"" sequences. Jane Asher is gorgeous, as is Hazel Court (in both films), and there's a wonderfully nasty featured role by Patrick McGee. Corman also had a bigger budget and more time to make this. Here again, the use of color is prevalent, but not red as you might think. The greens and blues seem to represent bad guys. Both films are presented in a good Panavision 2.35:1 LBX, which is great, especially in ""Masque"", which borrowed the sets from ""Becket"" and ""A Man for All Seasons"". (You COULD do worse...). They're gorgeous. This is a great package, not only for the very reasonable price. The interviews with Corman are essential to the ultimate appreciation of these films. Watch them first; then, enjoy! ALSO NOTICE: Maybe it's just me, but the vivid colors of the candles in the candlabras (in both films) seem to stand out. Great color photography!",1030752000,7,2860,4.985355648535565
1727060,5,B000068TPE,"Roger Corman's finest, most colorful and detailed work finally arrives on DVD--hopefully, it'll prompt the release of the remaining 3 Poe/Corman flicks (""Raven"", ""Haunted Palace"" and ""Tomb of Ligeia"" are still missing--and how about a widescreen DVD of Tourneur's ""Comedy of Terrors"" while you're at it, MGM?)  ""Masque of the Red Death"" stands as the most influential (and influenced--see the many Hitchcock and Bergman homages throughout the mise en scene) of the Poe pictures, the pinnacle of Corman's directorial design (with the scrumptious settings, abetted by old sets from ""Becket"", by Daniel Haller, Nicolas Roeg's glorious color photography, which the DVD superbly balances, and David Lee's fine, ritualistic music), filled with Corman's characteristically energetic camera work, experimental anamorphic distortions and odd color washes (the latter are used to great effect in Hazel Court's lingerie-clad dream sequence, a symbolic rape/sacrifice bit which is pretty hot for l964).  The story, of course, is well known--Vincent Price is at his cynical best as a misanthropic prince who seals his castle with several dozen noble guests against the plague, only to see the red spectre of Death, in Bergman-like robes, arrive as guest of honor. The expected bloody end for nearly all arrives on schedule, and ""darkness, decay and Red Death"" hold ""dominion over all."" Great, with a rainbow parade of Deaths at the end. Sic transit gloria Mundi . . .
  The print even restores a line long scissored as 'blasphemous' for the sixties, in which the Spectre of the Red Death (John Westbrook at his most sonorous) notes that ""each man creates his own God for himself, his own heaven, his own hell""--all pan-and-scan VHS/16mm prints cut the ""creates his own God"" line, not unlike the chopping of Colin Clive's railing against heaven in ""Frankenstein"".  Hooray for restoration!
  BUY IT, if you want to see the artistry possible in the drive-in horror genre; it's a bargain price, and you'll also get ""Premature Burial"", a minor entry in the series (Ray Milland is no Price, unhappily), but possessed of lush color, cobwebby settings, a nice dream sequence (a Charles Addams version of what might happen to a cataleptic in a supposedly burial-proof vault) and an EC Comics twist at the end. And again, Hazel Court's formidable bust appears in lace. Wish I were 15 again.
  It's the Masque you want to attend, though--it's a helluva party.  Poe rocks!",1030752000,6,2447,5.172151898734177
1727061,4,B000068TPE,"Premature Burial may be considered merely an extra, on this DVD  -  it's passable, but overall not that hot.  The real star of the show is Roger Corman's Masque of the Red Death, one of the best of his Poe cycle films.  Both movies were co-scripted by genre master Charles Beaumont, a frequent Twilight Zone contributor, the former with assistance from fellow genre master Ray Russell.  Premature Burial is the less impressive of the two due to general plot contrivance, which is rather hackneyed and predictable, and Ray Milland simply didn't have the presence for this kind of work that Vincent Price did.
Masque of the Red Death is a very clever rendition of two of Poe's best works, the title story and another lesser-known little piece of nastiness called ""Hop-Frog.""  Price plays the evil fourteenth century Prince Prospero, who safely ensconces all his country's nobles behind his castle's walls to keep them safe from the dreaded plague of the ""red death"" that is ravaging the populace.  Prospero is a decadent and sadistic Satanist, who views his role in the proceedings as that of more or less a diabolical Noah, preserving his own kind until the plague passes.  One of his guests  -  an equally despicable Patrick Magee  -  is horribly murdered by a dwarf he mocks and despises, constituting the ""Hop-Frog"" subplot.  Prospero, meanwhile, delights in attempting to seduce and degrade innocent Christian peasant girl Jane Asher, much to wife Hazel Court's great ire and dismay.  Eventually, an uninvited guest wearing the forbidden color red appears in Prospero and his partygoers' midst, whom Prospero takes to be none other than Satan, himself, come to delight in Prospero's evil handiwork  -  but who is actually none other than the Red Death, personified, with more than one gruesome surprise for Prospero...
The dialogue and symbolism in Masque of the Red Death are stellar.  The Red Death mocks Prospero from behind his mask, hinting at powers and knowledge Prospero only pretends to possess.  When Prospero suggests that only Satan could have sent him, since he believes Satan rules the universe, the Red Death wryly responds, ""He does not rule  -  alone...""  The concluding exchange between the two, and the gruesome finale of gaudily dressed partiers dying in an off-key, bloody ballet, is brilliant  -  the whole film is very Ingmar Bergman-esque.  The production is top-notch, extremely colorful, with absolutely gorgeous sets and costumes.
Buy it for Masque of the Red Death.  You might even enjoy Premature Burial, too.",1029974400,13,2541,5.050480769230769
