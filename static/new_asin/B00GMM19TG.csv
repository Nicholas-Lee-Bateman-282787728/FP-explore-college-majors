6087164,5,B00GMM19TG,There is a lot of wolf lore out there now. Much of it (both sides) is political and not terribly fact based (not trying to stir anything up- I just keep hearing things from different groups that say very contradictory things about wolves and their reintroduction into some areas). I learned a lot I didn't know about coyotes and wolves from this video (which I verified- so it also spurred a lot of reading). If you are also confused as to what to believe it's a good place to start to understand both sides.,1396137600,5,508,4.414893617021277
6087165,5,B00GMM19TG,"This DVD is wonderful.  It seems to be the only thing out there on the coywolf, an animal that results from the mating of wolf and coyote  (very, very simply put).  Explanations are longer, and very clear.  Sightings of the coywolf  going about its business in our cities, suburbs, and backyards are plentiful. It is such a beautiful animal--bigger than coyote, smaller than wolf, with a beautiful face, large ears, and a longish bushy tail. A fascinating film.",1395360000,5,461,4.858974358974359
6087166,3,B00GMM19TG,"Zorses, wholphins, mules, and my favorite, the tyglion are all hybrid animals.  The coywolf is a blend between a coyote and a wolf.  Many of these hybrids wouldn't happen without human's active intervention.  While humans created the conditions in which coywolves arose, it didn't happen because a zookeeper put a wolf and a coyote into the same cage.  This work said the animal is adapting and fearing humans less and less.
At first, this work focused only on Canada, so I figured that it may only be a phenomenon/problem for our neighbors to the North.  However, then the work showed that these creatures are active in the Chicagoland area, my backyard.  One day I think I did see a canine late at night dart between two buildings and thought to myself, ""Don't go near that!""  Here's the thing: when the Chicago press speak of wolves and coyotes coming to suburbia, the fear is that pet dogs can get killed and humans could get rabies.  This concern is barely presented here.  The work, instead, focuses on humans who have no fears about themselves, their children, or their pets being within 5 feet of these animals.
I also think the doc somewhat fudged on its subject matter.  At times, it speaks about coywolves clearly having features of both wolves and coyotes.  Then other times, it mentions coyotes solely.  I wonder if this work had so little material that it addressed coywolves for a bit and then fills the rest with coyotes.  For example, most hybrid animals cannot breed.  It is never stated whether the coywolf is sterile.  If they are fertile, with whom do they mate more often: coyotes or wolves?  At one point, you see a canine family where some individuals are black, some grey, and some both.  This may remind people of multi-chromatic human families.  The work suggests that this animal is monogamous.  Some humans may admire and love hearing that as much as viewers loved hearing about monogamous birds in ""March of the Penguins.""
People who like this doc should also like ""Kangaroo Mob"" and ""Raccoon Nation.""",1391299200,6,2031,4.7844827586206895

8624748,5,B00GMM19TG,"This documentary raises several interesting and very thought-provoking questions about coywolves (aka Eastern coyotes).  For instance, see Jeffrey Mingo's comments.  Rather than criticize this documentary, I, as a biologist by training, see the power of the documentary in its raising these questions, many times in an oblique way, and pointing out that these animals are evolving, are poorly understood, and need to be much more thoroughly studied, especially with regard to their interactions with humans.",1473724800,,507,5.746666666666667

8624756,5,B00GMM19TG,"Like all ""NATURE"" programs, this one is beautifully photographed, well-researched, and narrated informatively.

The story is fascinating, because these creatures have figured out how to prosper (not just survive) by plying their predatory niche ""right under our noses,"" sometimes in rust-belt environments and even in urban settings amidst our children and our backyard watchdogs.  Downright scary at times, because these hybrids have learned to take life when needed to protect their own.

Highly recommended: a tribute to the resourcefulness, stealth, adaptability, and toughness of Genus Canis.",1402876800,2,597,5.9186046511627906
