8124422,3,B000FKPDTS,"It was worth watching. Character development was good.  A little slow in parts, but worth watching to the end.",1431475200,,110,4.7894736842105265
8124423,5,B000FKPDTS,"brilliant, funny, honest, very good!!!!",1411948800,,39,7.0
8124424,5,B000FKPDTS,"I just watched this and was blown away.  I loved every scene, every second.

If you are in your older years, with grown-up children, and facing your own present and future while trying to come to grips with your children's version of your past; if you have had to face, as a grown-up child, the deterioration of our parents while sorting out the harm they may have done to you in the past; I suspect that this movie will resonate deeply with you.

If you are a grown-up child, working hard at your own life while trying to deal with your aging parents' present and future, it might resonate with you as well.

A tough, real, and very loving look at grown-up families.",1362528000,,667,4.3983739837398375
8124425,1,B000FKPDTS,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, and I usually watch this type of film, but when I found out that the movie was scripted, that was the deal breaker for me. There is nothing worse when a movie or TV show tells you it's reality and it's anything but. Note to makers of reality programs: Do not insult your audience's intelligence.
 The acting is so put on, I couldn't enjoy it. The family was playing too much to the camera. Once I had that feeling, the movie almost took on a cheap ""straight to video"" feel to it. The mother's acting was the worst, throwing foul language where it didn't belong; it was cringe inducing. Again, believe me, I went into this movie thinking I was going to see something as great as the reviews. To me this movie just fell flat. TC",1305417600,,763,4.298611111111111
8124426,3,B000FKPDTS,"When I saw this film, I was STARTLED at parts of it. I cringed, blushed, laughed and was very touched at the end. BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL DOCUMENTARY. After doing research--I discovered it was all scripted. The ""estranged"" son was the film maker! So it is nonsense when they see him at the end and are 'surprised', as he was ALWAYS around! That means the whole cross-country journey was also fiction (and completely unnecessary).  Online, the son claims the ""SCRIPT"" was created well before this all came to fruition.

SO...it IS a good film, if you didn't know better--if you thought it was a real documentary. I was originally fascinated by it. But that was when I believed it to be real. Now that I know the truth...it has all the intrigue of that stupid 'Blair Witch Project'.  Why would I want to see it a second time? Why would I want to own it? It is ""fiction in disguise.""

So I say forget this thing and get 'Grey Gardens.'  It is real, it is dear, and you will never forget it. I knew 'Little Edie' and you can be sure the film is the real deal.

I give this film three stars because it DID convince me, before I found out the truth. And this means it must be pretty well done. The parents are non-professional actors, which one can also appreciate.  Seeing it again, however,  would cause me to roll my eyes and dismiss the more outrageous parts as contrived.",1251676800,2,1378,4.376470588235295
8124427,1,B000FKPDTS,The word talent is terribly abused here.  What a pile of masturbatory crap!  Seriously - these people don't even care about themselves and thew show it constantly.  Does anyone need the burden of this family who should be caged?  They are self-loathing and they live in an endless circle of recrimination about their half-lived lives.  And still - where would they go and who would have them.  The 'extras' where they give themselves credit for bravely cobbling their psychoses into a script is just the capper that made me fully detest this film.,1239148800,3,547,4.827956989247312
8124428,5,B000FKPDTS,"I consider myself to be a very picky film viewer, for lack of a better term.  Saw this movie on Sundance a few days ago, DVRed it, like i do all movies, so i can give them a 10 minute trial run, so as to not waste time.  Just couldn't ""put this one down,"" even over the protests of my wife, who wanted to watch something insanely boring, like 24.  =)  Quirky and eccentric are two qualifications I have for a movie, and Talent Given Us has plenty of both.  The characters are all quite ordinary, yet endearing in their own ways.  And the very loose script kept my attention for the duration.  You either will love this film or hate it--I loved it.",1238889600,,647,4.169354838709677
8124429,4,B000FKPDTS,"I was a bit floored to see that 67 people are selling copies of this film and only one wrote a review. I see this as indicative of how alien these people are to most or maybe how unwilling most people are to go where this film goes. It is too unique to just watch once so I plan to watch it again, maybe several times before really commenting on it. My only recommendation then and the reason for only 4 stars is that I thnk this is a rare opportunity and should be viewed a few times to really have a chance to benefit from it.",1173744000,4,528,3.94392523364486
8124430,4,B000FKPDTS,"This film, perhaps best targeted to fans of ""Waiting For Guffman"" and other pseudo-documentary comedies of cringe-inducing revelation, is unbelievable in many senses of the word.  Unbelievable in its frankness, unbelievable in the wackiness of many of the characters.  Unbelievable as a documentary, since the director was also the cinematographer who filmed his parents having sex, his sister masturbating, his family searching for him cross country.  And finally, unbelievable that such a contrived, hammy, zany bunch of people work as objects of filmed entertainment.

The mother's extreme fickleness is matched by one sister's LA-based psychobabble.  The mother is painfully unaware of her whiplash changes in viewpoint and mood, while the daughter is paralyzingly self-probing in her artificial patois of new age spirituality and Freudian concepts.  These two loonies propel the situation forward (and backward) while other family members respond with frustration, resigned consternation, protest, patronizing, and many other shades of exasperated love. Various other people are sucked into the whirlpool and spit safely out on the other side of the vortex.

The comment on NY encapsulation, Beverly Hills loopiness, family bonds, emotional incest, and contemporary identity struggles:  the ironic observation of the filmmaker plays out surprisingly well despite the potential mess this film constantly threatens to become.  It is funny in the way that Corky St Clair pleasure/pain is.",1155427200,5,1490,5.767123287671233
