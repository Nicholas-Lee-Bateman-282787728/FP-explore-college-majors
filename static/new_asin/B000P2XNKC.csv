2809970,5,B000P2XNKC,"I received my order for this product in good time and as described. Just watched the DVDs and I have no complaints. They were complete (5 DVDs)
The instructors described in detail, how a novice can turn to a professional, dancing Waltz, Foxtrot, Swing and Rumba.

It was a Good Deal!!!",1305763200,3,285,4.588235294117647
2809971,5,B000P2XNKC,"Every couple dreams of a fairy tale wedding. But, what do you do when your mother-in-law-to-be hires the band? Well...to keep peace...you learn how to dance, the proper way. Wedding Dance Mastery helped me, no, us (we both needed this), so much. Both of us were used to just going on the dance floor and doing whatever our bodies do :-) But, with my new mother-in-law, that was not going to happen. So, we learned. We liked it...a lot. Enough to want to keep learning. You would be surprised how elegant you look and feel as you are going through each step of the Wedding Dance set. I would have to say that it really ""transformed"" how we envisioned our wedding. But, overall, I hate to admit, it was worth it.

Our wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was able to make friends with my new mother-in-law, which, is also, really, really important. My wife and I are hooked now. We may even try another one of these DVDs out.",1200873600,3,926,4.415204678362573
2809972,4,B000P2XNKC,"This is a fun way to learn to dance, though I'm not sure why they specifically targeted people planning weddings, as I think any couple who would like to learn to dance would enjoy it!  They do include tips on selecting music for the wedding dances and such, but this doesn't need to be for weddings alone.  The steps are clear and simple and, at first, I thought the transitions between steps were too long, but it was actually really helpful when we needed to go back to watch certain steps again, so that was probably very strategic on their part.  I have to admit the male instructor reminded me a lot of Donnie Osmond (lol).

I didn't really like the close up of the feet movements, but my husband actually found them very helpful, so many people might appreciate them!  The only thing I really wish they had done differently was that I wish the female instructor had selected a shorter dress.  Even though there were long slits in it, it was fairly difficult to see her dance steps when they were dancing together (and she couldn't hold her dress up). That choice resulted in an intermittent view of her feet/legs, (especially on small dance steps) which made it more difficult.

All in all, despite a cheesy feel to it, this is a great set of dance lessons!  I would recommend it to anyone who would like to learn some classic dances.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1438473600,,1427,4.5
2809973,5,B000P2XNKC,"Very clear instruction. I haven't watched all of the CD's yet because I just keep watching and practicing the first one! My son is getting married, I bought it for him.  I'm going to have to buy another set because I don't want to give up this one!",1437868800,2,248,4.166666666666667
2809974,2,B000P2XNKC,"After reading the positive reviews on here, I had high hopes for this DVD being able to teach in detail how to dance to me and my fiance who are complete novices. We tried the first disc (foxtrot) and second disc (waltz) and both times we found the instructional style very bad, and we were not able to benefit at all from this DVD set.
*** Not enough explanation ***
For each step, they show it twice with a view at different angles, but they don't explain each part of the movement enough for you to really understand the moves or the sequence of steps.
The sequence of each move shows the man's part at two angles, then the woman's part the same, and then they do a dance together. When it comes time to do the complete dance, they just start immediately with little warning or explanation on how to begin dancing together or make the man and woman's parts connect. The only exception was on the foxtrot was that they explained how to hold each others hands, but that was very brief, and what if I wanted to just do the waltz?
There is also a use of dancing terminology that I found no benefit, the gentleman instructor keeps saying ""Quick slow, quick quick slow"" which meant nothing to me and was never explained. I would have understood if he had counted the beats and said ""do this on the second beat"" for example.
*** Learning curve too steep ***
For the Waltz, the instructors immediately talk about things like rise and fall when you barely even have the foot pattern figured out. It would be nice if it was in more gradual steps. In the DVD it is broken down into moves, like the boxstep, then turns, but I felt like they needed to break it down further, focussing on each portion of each move, then covering on the footwork, body, posture, etc., then adding things like rise and fall.
*** Examples are too fast ***
When they demonstrate the man and womans dance parts together, not only do they start dancing immediately with zero explanation, they do it much too fast, and you end up stumbling all over the place trying to follow them. When they do the example with music, the music they choose is also too fast. Why not have a very slow tempo example, then gradually increase?
*** Hard to see the footwork ***
The lady in the video is wearing a long dress - what were they thinking?! How are you supposed to see her footwork when a dress covers up her legs? Every time she gives a demonstration of the angle she has to lift up her dress, why not just wear dress pants instead of making it harder on yourself? Not only that, but the picture-in-picture views of the foot movements are often inadequate, even on a 50"" TV - why not make the full frame the steps so you can see it clearly and focus on it. Again, more of a breakdown is needed of the footwork and detailed view and demo.
*** Needs smarter supporting content ***
At times, I felt like I was just watching them dance, and expected to learn entirely from watching them. While this might work for some people, I felt like showing the dance in a different way with other media would have been a huge benefit for those of us who aren't as coordinated. How about a diagram on the screen showing the pattern of the boxstep for example?  The camera was also completely stationary - how about taking the camera off that tripod in the corner and showing whats happening with your feet in slow-motion, maybe with arrows on the screen to show the motion?

So the hunt is back on for a better DVD for me to learn some dancing for my first dance. If anyone has any recommendations I'd love to know.",1437696000,4,3557,4.363499245852187
2809975,5,B000P2XNKC,Bought this for an upcoming wedding. It is a great tutorial for those who have no dancing skills like me. Will give to my sister as a gift for her wedding as well.,1436313600,,163,3.9696969696969697
2809976,4,B000P2XNKC,I received my DVDs quickly. So far I've viewed the Foxtrot DVD and it looks very good! I think my fiancee and I will be able to pick it up very quickly. It's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!,1436227200,2,197,3.95

2809978,5,B000P2XNKC,"My husband & I took ballroom / social dance lessons for a while, but then the teachers moved out of town.  After attending a family wedding recently, I realized I really wanted to brush up on what we knew, and add a few more steps.  This set of videos is just what I needed.  The description for this item is limited, so:

 Introduction of step  why/when you would use it
 Mens Breakdown of the step
 Womans Breakdown of the step
 couple dancing together  no music, talking you through it
 couple dancing together  with music, talking you through it

My Tips:
 At the end of some of the discs, they sometimes have a tips video segment.  I would suggest watching it before you get to the end of the disc (and maybe again after you have tried it a bit)  There are some excellent tips.
 The music for the menu for each disk is in the style of that dance.  Its in a repeating loop  so use it to practice!

Conclusion: You can use this to learn to social dance for a wedding or other party  you don't have to be the bride or groom.  Compared to the cost of lessons, this is a bargain, and you can do a few minutes a day to learn it.  It is great bonding time with your partner.  I purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked for my honest review based on my actual use of this product. After using it, I will tell you, IT WORKS, and this is a bargain compared to the dance lessons we took.  Its less than signing one of us up for the community classes.  It would be a great gift for a bride to be (or groom to be), but its great for anyone who wants to learn to dance.  We will be using these CDs until we learn all these steps before going back to lessons.  Please let me know if this review was helpful.  I will always update if I get additional insights after further using the product, and I try to answer any questions left in comments.",1435017600,6,3019,4.373646209386282

2809980,5,B000P2XNKC,"My fiance and I have been planning our wedding for a long time now. However, we have been dreading the wedding dance. We both have two left feet and I honestly didn't have much hope for us.

I began searching for a decent tutorial style DVD and was lucky enough to come across this one. The reviews looked good, so I decided to give it a try.

These DVDs are worth their weight in gold. We've been practicing like crazy and are actually starting to catch on. It's not like pulling teeth, which is how I was imaging it.

They are high quality, easy to follow videos. What I love most about it is how well they break down each dance to really show the viewer a pattern. It makes it so much easier to do.",1412467200,,701,4.139705882352941
2809981,5,B000P2XNKC,"I have to admit Ive been quiet nervous for a while. My fianc and I are getting married early next year and all she can talk about is how were going to dance at our wedding. Yikes! I cant dance worth a flip. In fact, it has always been one of my biggest fears.

Needless to say, Ive been dreading the wedding, not because Im not in love with her and want to spend the rest of my life with herbut because I just cant dance.  I decided to take proactive measures and started studying dancing on YouTube and watching TV shows like So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With the Stars. This didn't help any, so I went to find a dance studio and discovered there are no dancing studios in the small town I live in. The nearest one is 45 minutes away.

Finally I broke down and started buying dancing videos. Some were more helpful than others. I also confided in my fianc my problems, and she has been watching these videos with me, helping me to dance as well. We were pretty disappointed with what we had come across until I ordered this video.

Let me just say, this one is a knockout. I can now do the waltz and not feel uncomfortable about it. In fact, Im starting to learn the fox trot. This video is absolutely terrific. It has great production quality, its easy to follow, very step-by-step with its instructions on the dances, and my fianc and I have had a great time learning to it. There is classic teaching qualities in, a good breakdown of moves, music to dance the patterns to, and all of my questions have been answered.

Now its just up to me to keep practicing. Ive got to say Ive seen about 300 percent improvement so far. If you want to dance at your wedding or just learn how to dance such dances as the waltz, then this is for you.",1411862400,10,1747,4.2029850746268655

8188759,3,B000P2XNKC,"I was hoping I had found DVDs that would help me and my fianc learn to dance instead of having to go to a studio. I put in the first disc, and I was immediately disappointed at the production value. From what I was able to conjure myself to watch, it looked like the dancers ran through the script without filming again, skipping on their words and making it very awkward. On top of that, during the dance instruction, there's a little box that comes up on the lower right corner that's supposed to help you get a better angle of the dancer's feet, but it's not any more clear. I returned this immediately, and got a 50% refund because Amazon thinks I copied these DVDs......",1454198400,,675,4.365079365079365

8188762,5,B000P2XNKC,"This has been a great! My boyfriend and I have been wanting to learn to ballroom dance, especially swing, for quite some time now. We took some private lessons but they were extremely costly (like more than my car payment) this is great way to learn at home and at our own pace. I love they way the steps are broken down so you're able to follow along and you can pause and rewind as needed until you feel like you've got it before you move on to something more complicated. It's a lot of fun for us to push the furniture out of the way in the living and practice. Plus the bonus of no high pressured sales people! I would highly recommend this!

Pros:
- Very detailed
- Easy for beginners
- Easy to navigate

Cons:
- Older style
- A bit slow

I am younger and so is my boyfriend and that could be why I personally did not enjoy this dance video as much as others. It's an older style, the copyrights is from 1970, and very slow paced. That does not mean the video is not great, no it's highly detailed and it'll be sure you learn every step in more detail than you really need to know. I am a fast paced learner so the video is not quiet for me because I would rather learn the entire dance at once rather than break it up into men's and women's parts than together. It gets so detailed that it tells you exactly how to place your fingers and everything. It also shows the the different variations but it will go through the steps all over again for one change. Not bad but like I said I am a fast paced learner so I tend to be a little impatient. I've still learned a lot from it so I have given it 4 stars but I still find it boring for being so slow.
