8026921,4,B0002DRE54,It is basically documentary format for a Big Game. Shatner is the commander of one team. They could have used a few more cameras on the field and focused on the game rather than just follow shatner around the whole time. On the whole I enjoyed watching it and it is by far the best paintball movie I've seen. By and large paintball movies are horrible so that doesn't really say much. If you are a big fan of paintball or William shatner then go ahead and get this.,1374278400,,465,4.235955056179775
8026922,5,B0002DRE54,"There was just something engaging and entertaining about watching William Shatner confidently march around a paintball field and lead dozens of paintballers into battle. The quality is pretty low, the description leads you to think there'll be a plot when there isn't and half the time it's hard to tell what the main goal is but it's really fun. It's just a really good time and Shatner proves once again he;s the perfect man for any job, any where.",1367193600,,450,4.708860759493671
8026923,4,B0002DRE54,"""William Shatner's Spplat Attack"" is one of the most, um, unique DVD's I've ever seen. Essentially Shatner (and family) go to Joliet to participate in a huge paintball fracas being moderated by ""The Big Giant Head."" He is, of course, the Federation commander and is pitted against the Borg and Klingons in a three way melee of conspiracies, double-crosses, strategy, and multihued paint. Shatner even learns to fly a powered parachute to make a dramatic entry! This is a fairly low-budget production (though it does have original music from Herman Beeftink) that pares down an eight hour paintball war into 80 minutes of action.

I won't tell you which team won, but I will say that Shatner is genuinely wily on occasion (although some of his improvisation leads to head-scratching) and is in good spirits throughout. (Hint: sometimes the guys in the red shirts don't die.) Also included are several extras of outtakes, Shatner learning to fly the parachute (more entertaining than you might expect,) and Shatner's tutelage in the art of paintball strategy. I was going to give this three stars for cheesy weirdness, but the extras are so entertaining that I decided on a four star rating for the DVD overall. I was also pleased that part of the profits from the DVD went to one of William Shatner's favorite charities, the Hollywood Charity Horse Show.

I was especially amused that one of the other paintball leaders made a joke specifically ridiculing Shatner's singing, but the Federation commander took it good-naturedly. I am not into paintball, but this DVD is strangely peculiar and lends itself to enjoyment if you are in the right frame of mind and don't take William Shatner or ""Star Trek"" too seriously.",1294358400,,1715,4.951388888888889
8026924,4,B0002DRE54,"It's a paintball fight with William Shatner. It's exactly how it is described. I don't play paintball but it was still pretty amazing.  I don't know if it's really necessary to buy it, so perhaps Netflix, but I gave it as a gift and it was well enjoyed.",1286928000,,253,4.270833333333333
8026925,3,B0002DRE54,"Call it William Shatner's ""lost"" Star Trek script that is located in a very unique setting; the Federation, Borg and Klingons battle for control of the universe in a paintball war.

Shatner leads the Federation in the wild fun that keeps the story line moving throughout. With typical Shatner verve, a game becomes a fun way for James T. Kirk to lead the forces of good...one more time.",1230076800,,386,4.676470588235294
8026926,5,B0002DRE54,"If you love Star Trek, then you will enjoy this DVD. I have never played a game of paintball in my life, but this is one of my favorite DVDs I have. Shatner is the leader of a paintball group called the Federation and he leads his troops in paintball war against two other groups, the Klingons and the Borg. All three teams wear Trek like uniforms, which adds to the fun. There is even a mini-story in the game, which ever team wins gets control of the universe. All of the names are used by permission of Paramount, so it's like an official Trek paintball war! Trust me, it is a really fun thing to watch as Shatner commands his troops to fight the Klingons and the Borg. There are alliances made and broken and a lot of action in between. Overall, something that is just fun, I couldn't help but cheer for my favorite team. It gets you that involved!",1180396800,2,852,4.265432098765432
8026927,4,B0002DRE54,"This DVD will appeal to both rec and tournament players alike. It's a little cheesy, but that's what you except if it's William Shatner. There is some pretty rough adult language, mostly coming from that idiot DJ ""Mancow"".

  Still, it's a good time.",1121212800,2,250,4.767441860465116
8026928,4,B0002DRE54,"William Shatner's Spplat Attack: 1:21:45. This is Shatner like you have hopefully never seen him before. In the guise of a paint-ball game, the Klingon, Borg, and Federation will battle fight for possession of an all-powerful weapon controlled by an alien called Big Giant Head. Though this does sound contrived, all is simpler than you might expect. It is just a bunch of Americans shooting paint-balls at each other for the better part of an hour interspersed with strategy and laughs. If this sounds bad, it is not. The program starts off at a bit of a spoof to trek and deals with all things in a light manner. The three teams, the Klingon and Borg in very similar costumes, and the Federation in bright red shirts, battle it out using paint-balls and under-hand plots. You also get to see Shatner's current wife, who does not get to feature much though she does look very apt as shooting things, and his daughter who acts as a war journalist in a lovely yellow top. The outcome of the various battles and sieges are not pre-planned, even though the Federation does tend to do better, despite being in bright red shirts that do not seamlessly blend in with the paint splattered trees. If you like Shatner at his even at his worst, then you really cannot miss this.
Shatner's Combat Training: 5:23. This begins with Shatner discussing his plans for the paint-ball game. He mentioners how he wants the Klingon and Borg armies to be fighting among themselves. He is fairly serious while plotting, and appears to talk about the the sides in more their Star Trek terms than team. Next there is a brief bit about safety then you go straight to watching Shatner in a trial paint-ball run. This is fun to watch as he really does look his age and he gets hit in the jaw. The final segment shows the attempted trial launches of the parachute. Fine to watch but this does not really inform, just show what Shatner learnt [hence the training].
Extreme Paint-ball: Out-takes and Outrageousness: 5:07. This starts with a couple of accidents involving the camera man, namely him walking into the tent and him being shot in the delicates [he was not wearing lower protection] when he rounded a corner. There is a fun bit where Shatner talks to Welt-Man, a bloke who does not wear protection, and a sequence where he was [in protection] pounded with paint-balls for a good minuet or so. Then there is an extended sequence showing Shatner and co shooting a man after saying they would not and continued to do so as he was down until he cried out in pain for them to stop. It ends with w fun bit with the Big Giant Head caught talking to Yoda on his mobile before going into his warning voice mode.
The Arsenal: 16 pages. A lengthy text read on various aspects on the paint-ball gun. Fairly interesting, but best for people who have some interest in the sport. It is nice to include this on the dvd as a little extra.
Tom's Tips: 10 Pages. Here are eight frequently asked questions with well informed answers about paint-balling and how to get into the sport. This is useful only if you are interested in participating in paint-balling and have never done so before.
Maps of the Course: 5 Pics. This is just a gallery of five areas seen in the main feature. They include the Wastelands, Bedlam, Armageddon, Temple of Doom, and Fort Courage. This is actually good because during the main feature you did not get many aerial shots, so it was hard to see the big picture. Having seen these it does help somewhat.
Inside Challenge Park: 1.29. Essentially an add for challenge park. Fairly pointless. They should have just included this with all the ads they placed at the start of the dvd [through which you could luckily fast forward].
Photo Gallery: 15 Pics. I do not really see the point in photo galleries on dvds. If you want an image you use freeze frame, unless is it publicity material or behind the scenes - which none of these are. All the photos are good enough and it is worth the thirty seconds it would take to read. Only a couple of them are worth while though. On the third image, press left a couple of times and there is a 0:25 clip of Shatner saying that the other teams will lose the final battle, in a very non-subtle way.
Biographies: 17 Pages. The first one is Shatner which provides a fine background but tells you of nothing new. The second one is of Mancow and is much more interesting as you have never heard of him. It also is rather funny when talking how he managed to close off the Golden Gate Bridge. The third, Tom Kaye, is not really worth reading unless you have too much time on your hands.  In Creative Light Video there is nothing worth reading, but here is an easter egg lasting for 1:24 with Shatner talking about a couple of battles, his wife, and how he distrusted a borg informant. JJ Brookshire and Forest G. Brown are both of less interest, even when combined, than the CLV one, only this time without the egg. For another egg, you can go the the last page of Shatner's Biography and press right twice. This has a 1:11 clip of a lady making some dreadful noise in the tune of the classic trek theme. She should be shot. I think she is hot on Shatner, who looks a little bemused.",1043107200,10,5204,4.489451476793249
8026929,4,B0002DRE54,"Watching Shatner paraglide into a paintabll battle then fight an all day paint war, this thing is just plain fun. Especially if you are a Star Trek or Piantball enthusiast.",1039564800,5,172,4.766666666666667
8026930,5,B0002DRE54,"To be totally honest I don't have the DVD yet.  I saw this on pay per view and ordered it the day it went on sale.
I'm not a Star Trek fan so when a friend who played in the game told me about this video I was like ""So what.""  But curiosity got the better of me and I bought the pay per view.  This was amazing but it's hard to explain.  It's Shatner leading the Federation against a team of Borg and Klingon forces.  Each team has to have at least several hundred players because the end scene with everyone rushing that town is insane.
If that's all it was I might have only given it 3 stars for the effort but what really makes it great is the behind the scenes stuff.  Shatner is a fox on the battlefield.  When the Borg and Klingons team up against him he uses that to his advantage and ends up getting them to fight each other while his team cleans up.  Like I said, it's hard to describe but it's amazing to watch.
The more I think about it the more I come to the conclusion that the reason it's difficult to describe is because it's not like anything else out there I've seen before....",1039478400,9,1094,4.055813953488372
