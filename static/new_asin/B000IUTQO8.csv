This is a short, 30 minute sampler of promo and match highlights from The Rock's feud with The Corporation, featuring Triple H and The Undertaker.  Nothing is shown in its entirety, and all cuss words are bleeped.  Here's the rundown of clips:

01. Raw Is War - April 26, 1999 (promo & match)
02. Raw Is War - May 3, 1999 (promo)
03. Sunday Night Heat - May 16, 1999 (promo)
04. Raw Is War - May 17, 1999 (match)
05. Sunday Night Heat - May 23, 1999 (promo) [the night Owen Hart died]
06. Raw Is War - June 7, 1999 (match)
07. King Of The Ring Match History Package
08. King Of The Ring - June 28, 1999 (promo & match)
09. Raw Is War - July 5, 1999 (match)
10. Sunday Night Heat - July 11, 1999 (promo)

Besides being short and incomplete, this tape was duplicated in the inferior EP/SLP speed.  So you may have to adjust the tracking on your VCR to get an optimal picture.

The lack of bar code on the box, and ""sampler"" nature of the video, leads me to believe this was given out as a freebie with a Pay Per View purchase back in 1999.  I have a Best of Wrestlemania tape I got around 1999/2000 as a PPV mail-in freebie, so I think this tape was originally obtained in that manner as well. (I picked it up from a church's tag sale for less than a buck.)

There's a WWF DVD entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock-The-People-s-Champ/dp/B00004STEF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock: The People's Champ</a>&nbsp;that was released in 2000.  I would think that that DVD would contain the complete promos and matches that are sampled on this tape, but after reading KlownArt's review - which states that ""this DVD starts around WWE King Of The Ring 1999 and ends at The Rock's Royal Rumble win at WWE Royal Rumble 2000"" - I'm thinking that this material won't be found on that DVD.

There's a bunch of other Rock DVDs out there -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Know-Your-Role/dp/B00005RIYZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Know Your Role</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Bring-It/dp/B00005QAQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Bring It</a>, and the more-recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Electrifying-Man-in-Sports-Entertainment/dp/B00120LPQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment</a>&nbsp;- but I highly doubt that any of them would contain ALL of the complete promos and matches that are sampled on this tape. (At best you'd probably get a complete promo or match here or there.)  So, short of finding a good tape trader, this tape, as sparse and edited as it might be, might be the only way to obtain some of these promos and matches.",1278460800,,3538,5.966403162055336
