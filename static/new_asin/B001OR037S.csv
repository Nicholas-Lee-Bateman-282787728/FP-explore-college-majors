yes they are very basic with no extras, bt ""The Classic Theatre"" LLC 2006.
It is interesting how on a particular DVD there can be an episode with Station Identification
with a ""G"" appearing upper left corner for 5 seconds, then as the episode begins there is a
notice like  CFCF
  12  which in turn goes away after a few seconds.
Those are the clear episodes, on the same DVD there can be an episode with no station I.D,
with a foggy picture, -- anyhow i have enough great episodes to satisfy my longing for this series
that was my favourite as a youngster.
Part of the book ""Mask and Flippers"" 1960 by Lloyd Bridges as told to Bill Barada, goes into a
little detail about the making of this series}.
""Thanks to Sea Hunt I am now part of a close Knit fraternity, and I feel that I have friends
wherever there is water. I am happy that my 2 sons BO 18, and Jeff 10, are enthusiastic skin divers and can enjoy the same experience of close fellowship with the diving fraternity.
They are also beginning acting careers and both have appeared in Sea Hunt episodes, my daughter Cindy is only 6 but she is working on her diving in the hope of joining her brothers.
It looks as if my wife Dorothy may find herself in the midst of a web-footed family, and she may have to the water in self defense"".
And later.... "" CO2 in the air absorbes and retains heat from the sun and, as the concentration
increases, it may cause drastic changes in the weather.
One theory is that it is already causing the Earth to warm up and is beginning to melt the Polar ace cap"".
And why colour film was not used:  ""One reason was that water acts as a filter in absorbing colour from sunlight, red does not penetrate much below 15-20 feet, orange and yellow are filtered out a little deeper, and at 30 feet or more only blues and greens register on the film.
In deep water these colours are also invisible to the naked eye.
And I have followed a red fish as it swam toward the bottom and watched its colour change from red to orange, through yellow, until finally the fish appeared blue-green.
Perhaps in the future sensitive colour film will be developed and artificial lighting techniques perfected which will make it practical to film an underwater television series in colour, when this happens audiences will be treated to the spectacular beauty of deepwater seascapes as
colourful as a Botanical garden"".

8331272,1,B001OR037S,"I can only concurr with C. Stone's review.  I cherished the storyline memories but suffered by garage quality reproduction. Obviously, no copyright license fee were paid by this pirated distribution. I can only say that Ivan Tors(Producer) and the late Lloyd Brdges'Estate most llikely didn't financially benefit from this unauthorized distribution!.  I can only hope that his Family Estate may raise issue with the late Father's Intellectual Properties being exploited by ""TV OUTLET"". I can only wish that this review serves as a deterrent from further piracy and monetary explotation of talented and accomplished artists and their works.
Sincerely,
D. Stone",1268611200,3,659,5.514851485148514
8331273,1,B001OR037S,"For starters the DVD collection that I ordered arrived 4 weeks late. I had no present for my father for his birthday. I am dead serious when I say the 4 DVD plastic box cases (TV series) were all broken. The DVD cases were wrapped only in post office shipping PAPER with no padding or card board box for protection so when I unwrapped it the edges of the two outter boxes we completely gone and shattered. All the fragmented pieces were rolling around with the DVD's themselves! These were burned copies from VHS which made them unbareable to watch. Too many split second black blobs appeared from the worn or dirty VHS tape it was recorded from. The black boxes that were shattered had a computer print out of the TV shows main character and the title of the series, thats it. And if that's not enough there isn't even a list of the episodes let alone any other info (summary, guest stars, director....whatever else is on the back of DVD boxes.) When you put the DVD in the player a gray box appears that reads ""tittle menu"" and it lists the four episodes that are one that disk. The dude couldn't even spell ""title"" right or capatalize it. Some episodes start halfway through the theme song, others a minute into the show itself. I was too embarassed to give it to my father so I got a gift card instead. Let's see if he argues about giving me my money back, that would be hilarious. You must know I hated having to use time to write this review, I am not exagerating on any level. This guy, I think the name is ""TV Outlet"" has otherwise good ratings. I do not know what happend here but it was complete b.s.!",1246060800,13,1611,4.337748344370861
