8738468,5,B017A7BIQ0,"Among my five all-time favorite animes. The storyline is fantastic, clever and fast moving. Superb graphics! The actual package is 24 episodes and you must find the full length copy as part two is a great as part one. The main character lives for manga and otherwise he initially comes across as lazy and shiftless. He becomes a national hero at the beginning and is reactivated as an officer in the Japanese Army. From that point forward, no matter what happens, he keeps on becoming a hero (in despite of himself) for the entire story.

He unintentionally winds up with three girls who become attached to him like magnets after he encounters each one on successive military missions. One is a blond elf (Tuka), another is a dark demon disciple of legend (Rory)that is supposed to be 1061 years old (but looks 21) and the third is scholarly little magician in training (Leilei) who is extremely intelligent, soft spoken and cannot learn about things fast enough. The character development of these three girls is exceptional as the story progresses.

There is a sealed GATE on the outskirts of Tokyo that is penetrated by hostile tribes from the other side and attacks a section of Tokyo causing casualties, but is driven back. The tribes from this unknown side of the GATE are a mixture of many creatures, but mainly human military soldiers from medieval times that current day Tokyo citizens were never aware. In retaliation, the Japanese Government order a military mission through the GATE and, predictably, their modern-day army (of infantry, tanks, and helicopters) demolishes the legions warriors carrying spears, swords and shields. Once outside the GATE, the Japanese Army establishes modern garrison and decide to explore this unknown land for resources and learn more about the many scattered little nations. That is where our hero surfaces. As a young officer, he is sent to lead several patrols throughout the new land. where he encounters the three girls, plus helping several villages under attack. It turns out he's a lot smarter and courageous than anyone gave him credit for, despite his shy and ambivalent demeanor.

He becomes a compassionate hero saving people and fighting fire breathing dragons. There is never a dull episode as this 24-part story unravels. While a bit bloody in a few sequences, the development of additional characters adds to the storyline and excellent humor abounds throughout. While bizarre in nature, the entire story is clever and fast-paced. The author(s) deserve writing awards for this one. It is the most totally entertaining anime I have ever watched.",1483488000,,2605,5.053488372093023
