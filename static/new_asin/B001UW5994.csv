""The Universe: Our Solar System"" is another History channel special in HD just gleaming with hi-def celestial images and CGI blends of space and our planets. It is a ridiculously gorgeous travel through the solar system complete with expert interviews and narratives focusing on the most impressive facts and figures as well as driving for information relevant to today, for example: How could sun spots impact the weather and future of our home planet, Earth?

Leave it to the history channel to take something we all take for granted like our sun, put it under a microscope of analysis to conclude that while it has been existence for millions of years, that it may burn out and die under our watch and annihilate the human race (we don't have enough problems, right?). It adds a little extra excitement and sensationalism to entities that should be fascinating enough on their own, but I can sympathize with today's attention spans that throwing in a little fear can be the best way to get interested and absorb by putting a personal stake on matters. After all, this is what I remembered the most about this episode!

Beyond the sun, this set also journeys to Mars exploring the possibility of a human settlement there someday (I think I've seen a movie about this....). The Ends of Earth are explored in the most devastating ways possible with the deep space threats to the planet (now I KNOW I've seen that movie 2-5 times). Not to be outdone, the History channel focuses on Jupiter: the Giant Planet, The Moon (could've used more Mooninites from Aqua Teen Hunger Force but otherwise a very cool place to visit. You should watch the movie, ""Moon"" starring Sam Rockwell if you haven't already!!), the Inner Planets: Mercury & Venus (underappreciated), and Saturn: Lord of the Rings (the trilogy is one of my favorite movies ever as a whole and should be left with me if I'm stuck on a deserted island). Alien Galaxies and the Life and Death of a Star are also touched upon with their own episodes.

The science is just plain cool when it comes down to it and these are the best images you'll see beyond getting your own super-powered telescope (and I'm willing to bet these are STILL better). The History channel once again excels at bringing in the information, making it educational, relevant, interesting, and exciting which is great for targeting students or those of us adults who just have a joy for learning all the time. Pick it up for the brain in your household!!

3812733,3,B001UW5994,Please be aware that this set is the first and second disks of The Universe: The Complete Season One.  Disc 3 of The Complete Season One (not included in this set) also contains one episode on the outer planets.,1281830400,42,211,4.410256410256411
3812734,5,B001UW5994,"We already have a number of ""The Universe"" titles in our DVD library, but we just received a new Blu-ray player as a gift and I can't wait to get this new ""Universe"" Blu-ray release and see how much better it looks!",1280102400,,215,4.142857142857143
3812735,5,B001UW5994,"While certainly a great 2 disk video set, it it misnamed.  The series is extremely detailed and looks great. The disks cover Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, the Sun, Mars, and Jupiter.  It does not cover the outer gas giant planets; nor mention them.  Many moons of the large gas giants are fascinating; the ones around Jupiter get short shrifted.  I don't enjoy commentaries that over over dramatized either; this set has a bit of that.  I want the facts, not dramatization.  I know the sun will self destruct eventually, for instance; no need to be dramatic.  The great plus to the set is the CGI is up to date and done well.  Great teaching tool for the planets mentioned.  The detail on the Moon was very good!",1248480000,29,715,4.5234375

3812810,1,B001UW5994,"If you don't have the season one release, it's hard to say what makes this abbreviated re-release more desirable than the whole package already offered. The content here is good and the transfers are nice, if not perfect, but there is a better version of this material already readily available. This release is a fair bit cheaper at the time of this writing, so it's got that going for it, but otherwise, if you're interested in the series, skip this release and get The Universe - The Complete Season One instead, it just makes more sense.",1391904000,2,541,4.645833333333333

He has only lied once in his life. Either it's about this or he really has piloted a space shuttle to Mars.",1380153600,2,305,4.169491525423729

3812814,2,B001UW5994,"Just picked this up at Barnes and Noble at 60% off. Once you get this, you'll see why it's so cheap. Ignore the some of the reviews on this title, I would venture to bet that employees a History/Discovery have to write a positive review on their products because anyone that has this actually can't ignore the major flaws with this blu ray. For starters, the narration is very dry and doesn't go in depth into the subjects that is featured. Secondly, there are no special features that are common with blu ray or even DVD at this point in time. Lastly, even though it's on Blu Ray, it's standard def 480i and yes, I have the HDMI hook up running up to 1080p. That's right, IT""S NOT EVEN HIGH DEF! There is no reason at all this should have even been produced on Blu Ray. It says on the cover History HD, but the presintation is not in HD.Total waste!

If you must buy this then pick up the DVD version. I'm a huge fan of History/Discovery/BBC productions. Their HD works are amazing. It's a shame that this got little to no effort. I gave this 2 stars because it does look nice even at 480i and like I said, I'm a huge fan of History/Discovery/BBC.If your looking to be amazed & show off your Blu Ray & HDTV, prepare to be disapointed.",1298246400,12,1235,4.277777777777778
