8227587,5,B000XAEH4M,"If you're a fan of dark/black comedies, you'll like this one. Its very funny in a weird way. Also fascinating if you have any interest in the ex-Yugoslavia as the film is a trip through Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Kosovo. If you're expecting a mainstream comedy, this might be too much for you. The two lead actors are very convincing in their roles. Excellent film",1294790400,,379,4.757575757575758
8227588,4,B000XAEH4M,"I have been chasing this DVd for several years. It is a beautiful piece of dance magic, French history depicted through the magic of the ballroom, no dialogue , all music and great characters. This is a unique entertainment and a valued part of my DVD collection . Garry Stewart. Australia .",1294704000,,291,4.615384615384615
8227589,1,B000XAEH4M,"Approximately 30 minutes of the opening of the DVD consisted of advertisements and previews of other DVDs of this company - in Portuguese. Then withing a few seconds of the opening of Le Bal, the DVD became stuck and would not fast forward so that the film could not be viewed. I appreciated that Amazon allowed me to return the product and gave me a gift credit for the cost. I would like to know if other purchasers had the same experience. I am hesitant about reordering the DVD even though I am most anxious to own and see again Le Bal - a really great film. Please advise.",1277078400,2,577,4.302752293577981
8227590,5,B000XAEH4M,"""And summoned now to deal
  With your invincible defeat,
  You live your life as if it's real...""
  Leonard Cohen ""A thousand kisses deep""

How can loneliness, desire, desperation, and joy be expressed through dance movements by people who don't know how to dance, without one word spoken between them, and still make their audience feel every raw emotion? This is not your regular prance and cavort movie, in a breed of ""Chicago"" or ""Grease""; nor is it a movie for general consumers of flickers.

In the movie ""Le Bal"", the highest and the lowest moments in people's lives and their country's junctures are confined to a single ball room.

The people's private lives are inseparable from their time and the society they belong to. In the beginning of the movie, wary and defeated people many years past their prime enter the ball room in a desperate attempt to find a partner; a possibility of love. The movie then throws us back in time; people are young, their expectations and hopes coincide with France's ushering in of a New Era in 1936, when a coalition of Leftist parties won the general election. Each new segment brings us into another epoch in French society: WWII (one the most profound moments in the movie--the tragedy of the war, yet a camaraderie in the face of adversity, appended by an Edith Piaf song), the German occupation, collaboration, postwar reconstruction, loss of an empire, American influence, and endeavor of a new prosperity. As ""Le Bal"" moves chronologically from 1967 to 1983, the time of the production, the French shifted to a more conservative mode, with people becoming progressively estranged and disaffected. The movie ends at the same point in time as it begins. Everyone arrived alone, and everybody left the ball room alone. They met, parted, hoped, self-destructed and self-medicated, stole moments of happiness, and parted with their hopes. There is no happy ending, there is not even a tragic one, just life with its aspirations that have not been fulfilled, a road from the best of youth to the logical conclusion of missed opportunities, lost loves, and forgotten passions.

The characters accept their defeat as France concedes its fall from greatness. The grieving of a lost empire or defeated army parallels the feeling of calamity in personal lives. And still, I would be hard pressed to see this movie as only a story of loss, turmoil and alienation. If in the end our aspirations don't transpire, had not we achieved something by just simply living? Even a trounced army wins a few battles...

I have decided long ago not to acquaint myself with political beliefs of great writers and movie directors, with their laments about the decline of Western Civilization and the evils of modern society, with US being on the forefront. There is a contradiction in their views. After all, alienation is a byproduct of personal liberties and broken families--of advancement of women's rights. But if everybody was thinking only rationally, nobody would ever make the movie ""Le Bal"". Even though I am a person of letters, I have seen ""Le Bal"" six times over a period of 25 years, and I rarely give a movie a second try. Any person who thinks of himself as a true movies aficionado must see it.",1260921600,6,3235,4.863636363636363
8227591,5,B000XAEH4M,This is an unusual film in that there is no dialog and the story is told through the skilled actions of the actors.  The entire movie takes place in one dance hall through a number of time periods with the same actors.  Skillful direction and acting keep the story going and the interest high.  A thoroughly entertaining film and quite different for its time.,1252108800,,359,4.578125
8227592,4,B000XAEH4M,"This review is more about the DVD release than the movie itself. The latter, of course, is a unique masterpiece. There are some awkward moments, few oversimplified character clich&eacute;s, and certain ""humorous"" scenes that I could live without, but after all, it is a pantomime and very few films come close to this one in brilliancy of the concept and mastery of its execution. Now, about this Platina Films issue. Amazon's and the seller's notes accurately state that there are no English audio and subtitles, but who needs English in a film without a single spoken word. And it is also an all-region disk, which is a plus. However, there is one caveat, which is not mentioned in any description, and which one should know about before buying this DVD. The movie is preceded by a ""coming attraction"" trailer, which is 20 minutes long! And it is impossible to skip (at least I couldn't). Such ""feature"" could be appropriate for a one-time, disposable DVD (joke, there is no such thing), but it is certainly detrimental to a repeat viewing. I was so peeved by the Platina's impudence at first that considered returning the DVD, but then the trailer ended, the DVD paused at the main menu, and I pushed the ""play"" button. And as I watched, my anger disappeared, and by the film's end I decided to keep it. Since it is unlikely that you, the reader, will view this film in a hurry, just slip the disk into the player 20 minutes earlier, call your friends, do some cooking, and when all is ready, enjoy this beautiful work of art. I, on the other hand, had to take one star away, because of the trailer nuisance.

The following was added in September 2011:
With a number of new offerings of this film showing up in the catalogue, I decided to try my luck and buy another copy. To mitigate the risk, I went with the cheapest version, an Italian DVD, titled ""Ballando Ballando"". It turned out to be a far superior edition in every respect, with much better picture quality. It even includes video interview with Scola, but unfortunately no subtitles. The Italian version is a Region 2 disk, but most people interested in this kind of movies should have an all-region player, and if you do, buy ""Ballando Ballando"" instead of this (Portuguese language) one without reservations. Will save some money too.",1215734400,15,2300,4.693069306930693
