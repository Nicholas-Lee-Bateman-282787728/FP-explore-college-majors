8504417,3,6304180683,"My first thought is that this film is essentially a bad joke. It's shocking, disturbing, bizarre, sad, funny, borderline revolting, erotic, borderline pornographic, and occasionally romantic. I assume it is meant as a broad comment on the life and death of Yukio Mishima, Japan's famous author, who was a homosexual and had his own distinct nationalistic qualities. He was apparently followed by a group of young men who all seemed to be willing to give up their lives for some idealistic principles about what it meant to be Japanese.

All of that seems to be covered in this unique journey into a world that very, very few people might have actually inhabited. What's shocking, I suppose, is that there are very distinct moments of romanticism between the main couple, and had anybody been brave enough to have told the story of two ostensibly straight Japanese men in Japan in the 1970s who decide to live together as a couple, and allowed their love story to unfold, this could have been a killer film. Instead, what exists is simply bizarre. There are definitely erotic moments and it was hard to tell if people were acting or ""going for it."" A one-time viewing, with your mouth agape, is what this is. If you're into film oddities, especially ones with a homosexual bent (no pun intended), this is a must-see.",1444953600,,1315,4.79295154185022
8504418,4,6304180683,"A young man who enters a paramilitary group that defends the 'authentic Chinese values' discovers rapidly that, at night, the group indulges in (homo)sexual orgies. Every plot move is designed to show more naked Asian  males and what's more, the creators don't have the intention to hide their  goal. The ending of this short (60 minutes!) soft porn movie is hilarious.  Watch out for some unexpected puns in the English subtitles.",925171200,22,431,5.042253521126761
