This is the most complete and accurate review of this VHS you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each VHS I review has a ""Match of the VHS"" award somewhere in it.)

Randy Savage- The Missing Matches
These are all those matches that Savage didn't want people to see...or maybe he forgot ever happened. Regardless, this is a thirty-minute video featuring two matches with Savage and another unrelated match. These are all nice to watch for their rarity, but most are clipped and will leave much to be desired. All the matches are from sometime in 1981.

Steel Cage Match
Southern Heavyweight Championship
Jerry ""The King"" Lawler(c) VS Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage
The cage in this one is set up weird. It works like a Hell in a Cell where is surrounds the ring and a little outside the ring, but it has no roof. It is also really small for a cage. This match is clipped, but you see enough of it. Savage hits a good double axe handle to Lawler on the outside. Savage also jumps off the cage, but lands in a lame way. This match is fun to watch, but it is clipped and the ending involves a lot of interference.
RATING- 6/10

Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage & Larry Poffo VS Rock n' Roll Express (Match of the VHS)
This was a short, but still clipped for some reason, match. Express provided some fun quickness. Savage and Poffo cheated a lot and got their share of moves in. The aftermath is awesome considering in 1981 it was a very rare sight.
RATING- 6.5/10

The Fabulous Blondes VS PYT Express
This was a pretty basic tag team matches. PYT controls most of the match. There is some brawling on the outside every now and then. The only note worthy thing worth pointing out is that Koko B. Ware is a member of PYT Express.

1. Hogan as a heel was boring.

2. RANDY ""MACHO MAN"" SAVAGE RULES, and IS fun to watch heel or face.

BUT, this tape is 30 minits long, so this is only recomened for savage fans, or if this is cheep. But this thing is good.",1140134400,,276,3.7241379310344827
