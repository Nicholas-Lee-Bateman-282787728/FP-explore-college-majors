8153791,5,B000K15W4S,I looked everywhere online for this DVD and could only find it here. (Why it's not on PBS's site is beyond me). I needed to re-watch this for a project for school (Forensic Psychology) and it came in great condition and just as expected. The story is very interesting. Don't waste time trying to find it anywhere else (unless you want to get the VHS copy from a university library) It is a relatively short documentary but I got an A on my project :),1436832000,,450,4.305882352941176
