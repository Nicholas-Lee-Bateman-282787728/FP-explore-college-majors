8116830,5,B000F3AAGQ,"The great Pedro Infante takes a back seat to Carmen Sevilla in this ""film within a film,"" as the plot revolves around a producer who contracts a Spanish movie star to make a film in Mexico, and as her ""love interest,"" hires an unknown charro singer who is performing in the ""Aqui es Jalisco"" cantina. Their initial meeting is a disaster, and goes from bad to worse, as in their pride and many insecurities they deny their love for each other. Directed by Rafael Baledon, ""Gitana Tenias Que Ser"" has 9 songs, most of them sung solo or in part by Sevilla, who was a mega-star in the 50's in her native Spain, and also well known internationally. Her beauty, graceful dancing and lovely voice show why she achieved so much success at such an early age (she was 23 at the time of this film).

There are many scenes with marvelous flamenco singing and dancing, as well as some mariachi numbers, in this blend of cultures and musical styles. There are some notable duets between Infante and Sevilla: ""Cielito Lindo,"" ""Piel Canela,"" and ""Guadalajara,"" and among Infante's solos are ""Que Me Toquen Las Golondrinas."" ""Gitana Tenias Que Ser"" alternates between broad slapstick comedy and romantic melodrama, and just squeaks into the 5 star category because of its 2 superb leads, and a solid supporting cast, which includes Estrellita Castro as Tia Paquita.

Pedro Infante (1917-1957), was Mexico's most loved singer/actor, and 50 years after his untimely passing when he crashed his plane in the Yucatan, he reigns supreme, and his many films and recordings are national treasures.",1175644800,8,1573,4.865671641791045
