The girls are on their midterm assignment on the huge space tunnel and are doing quite well for themselves.  Mylandah (boo,hiss!) on the other hand has other plans for the trio.  She changes the course and Akari, Kris and Anna must get out of the satellite quick or be incinerated on reentry.  In the next episode, it's the annual boy's satellite competition.  The game is Acro Spike, like volleyball with your feet, and the principal selects Akari, Tanya and Mylandah to take on the men's school.  In the end it comes all down to Akari as she plays against a very unexpected opponent...The animation in the series isn't the greatest but the character designs are unique and the concept, while not new, is fresh.  I always recommend subtitles, but the dubbing is not all that bad, even tolerable.  All in all, it's a fair concept backed by a great story and cast.",985046400,,1032,4.565217391304348
