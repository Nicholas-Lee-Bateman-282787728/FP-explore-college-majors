3875772,4,B002945DWA,"... and it looks like some features in the original John Ford - John Wayne collection are missing.

Here's the press release for this new set:

JOHN WAYNE-JOHN FORD FILM COLLECTION Collection Includes:
THE SEARCHERS TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION - Wayne's favorite role. And, many say, Ford's best film.
THE WINGS OF EAGLES - A compassionate biopic salute: aviation pioneer ""Spig"" Wead (Wayne) overcomes tragedy to forge a Hollywood career. Maureen O'Hara co-stars.
FORT APACHE - They're duty bound to obey. But Wayne and other cavalrymen are at odds with the orders of ramrod commander Henry Fonda. Shirley Temple co-stars.
3 GODFATHERS - The tale of the Magi - Western style. Fugitive bank robbers won't abandon the infant entrusted to them, even though caring for him dims their chances of escape.
SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON - Another Ford masterpiece of mood and heroics. An aging officer (Wayne) who knows the agony of war seeks to make his last mission one of peace. Won Academy Award of 1949 for Best Color Cinematography.
THEY WERE EXPENDABLE - Wayne and Robert Montgomery are PT-boat skippers in ""one of the finest (and most underrated) of all World War II films"" (Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide).
Bonus Documentary Disc - First Time on DVD:
DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD - Peter Bogdanovich's groundbreaking tribute to the filmmaker, restored and reedited to include more classic clips and insightful anecdotes from Clint Eastwood, Katharine Hepburn, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and more contemporary cinema giants.

If this description is complete then ""Stagecoach"" and ""The Long Voyage Home"" are missing from this release of this boxed set versus the first release. What has been added is the documentary on John Ford. That 110 minute documentary is available separately here -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Directed-by-John-Ford/dp/B002945DVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Directed by John Ford</a>. My suggestion, and what I intend to do, is to buy the documentary separately.

Wayne became a star based on his performance in Stagecoach in 1939, after first gaining some short-lived attention when he appeared in 1930's ""The Big Trail"". The original boxed set is still available without the documentary and with the missing two movies of this package. I would still recommend that set over this one as long as the original set is available. Stagecoach is essential for any John Wayne fan and I can't see owning this collection if it is not part of it.",1244678400,29,2496,5.343511450381679

8357372,5,B002945DWA,"If you're a person who enjoys Westerns,beautiful cinematography,solid acting,and straight-forward dialogue;it's hard to beat a Wayne-Ford collaboration! The film's they did together are represented nicely here. The westernWesterns are some of the best EVER made;as for the others: They We're Expendable-Wayne & cast do a believable job as patrol/small strike boat crews in the Pacific,during WWII.  The Wings Of Eagles is a departure for Wayne,in a ""mostly dramatic-almost- everyday character role....but there's the added bonus of interaction with Maureen O'Hara....which was always Big-screen magic. Most of you may not be familiar with all these films but, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! You even get a six disc that gives insight to the great director John Ford.
