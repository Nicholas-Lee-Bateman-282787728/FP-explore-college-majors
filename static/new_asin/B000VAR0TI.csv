This show is a pretty solid worth Owning.

Overall Rating 3.5/5 [rounded up to 4]
This one follows the path of three generations of the Mutsu Enmei warriors as the fight famous warriors across Japanese history.

The first two arcs are pretty solid; I would say.  The third really drags on.     It really drags. I almost say once you get past the first two arcs you should skip the last one.  Its too bad the last arc is the longest But, the Mutsu Enmei guys are pretty cool. The fights are interesting. Im just not a fan of the last arc

Theme Songs 4/5
This series opening and ending themes have a solid samurai beat.  I can dig it

Awesome.
The dub is not too bad either.

8217896,5,B000VAR0TI,"This was a shot in the dark for me, and it was one of those rare times where that paid off. Its a few different stories in one but they're all connected, some people may not like that especially since most people will like the 1st characters best. But it really dosnt take away from it. I got it under $20 and I'm happy with that, but I wouldn't recommend spending much over that. It's a great less heard of anime, but I wouldn't say it'll be anyones favorite.",1370304000,,460,4.179775280898877
8217897,5,B000VAR0TI,"This series is awesome. Im picky as hell when it comes to anime. The animation here is simple and light hearted, reminscent of pokemon. but when the action happens- its unprecedented. if you like unarmed combat, or anime in general- this is not to be missed.",1217635200,5,258,4.630434782608695
