5392423,5,B00A7MSQSO,"It's a great movie that highlights a lot of truth about under-performing schools, bad teachers, but above all, bad attitudes. The bad attitudes are very real and hinder learning VERY much. As someone in education, this movie speaks perfectly to me, and the scenes, the emotions, the acting, the dialogue was great.
The ending was SO good, and so quality, even while idealistic.
After seeing it twice, I have nothing bad to say.",1357516800,2,427,4.863013698630137

5392425,1,B00A7MSQSO,"I really tried to like this movie.  Being an educator, I was interested in the movie's plot, but my enthusiasm was quickly ended.  Maggie Gyllenhaal was awful; she came off like a hyperactive, overly playful puppy.  Viola Davis, whom I usually love to watch, was a painful foil for  Gyllenhaal and appeared to be heavily sedated.  The whole movie was awful: the lighting and set direction barely met the level of a high-school YouTube production, the story became muddied by the horrible acting and directing...I could go on, but this movie isn't even worth a scathing wall of text.",1357430400,4,582,4.838383838383838
5392426,5,B00A7MSQSO,"as a teacher's aide considering getting my teaching certificate and as a mother, this movie truly moved me to think more seriously about the choices I make every day regarding the education of children.",1357430400,,202,4.970588235294118
5392427,1,B00A7MSQSO,the movie itself is a good movie but the video was poor I watch about 5 minutes of it and I stopped I try again later it wasn't worth it the audio was good  but the video was bad very disappointed,1357430400,,196,3.7804878048780486
5392428,3,B00A7MSQSO,"As above, buy the audio on the movie was terrible.  The family was constantly asking ""what did they say.""  Wish all parents fought this hard for their schools to be good.",1357344000,,170,4.451612903225806
5392429,3,B00A7MSQSO,"I enjoyed the movie ""Won't back Down"". The cast was great Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jamie Fitzpatrick and Viola Davis as Nona Alberts both played very good parts. And since I am from Pittsburgh, I enjoyed the familiar scenes. The movie was inspired by true events, and I did like the storyline.  Although, I would have liked it  more if they would have elaborated more on the ending?  Was the school successful? How well did the kids do?  Did it in fact fold after a short period of time.

I do think it is hard to be a good teacher.  They need to deal with both teachers and parents, along with problem kids.  I do think education should not only depend on the school alone, but we parents need to take an active part in it. So I do feel that you need to pay close attention to what is going on with your kids and their school work.  That is not just up to the teacher, it is a joint effort between both parent and teacher.

Overall, I did like this and would recommend it. We did watch this on Amazon's instant video and we did  experience some technical difficulty several times.  It was somewhat annoying. Eventually, it did stop and we enjoyed the movie.",1357257600,,1154,4.32093023255814

5392433,4,B00A7MSQSO,This is apparently based on a true story. I loved the portrayal of the mother because she didn't allow negativity from others to discourage her. I would hope the movie would inspire others to make a difference in other  public schools . Now Id like to see a  movie showing the fight that parents have watching education dollars be  channeled into social engineering projects  which eclipse the basic purpose of public education. The movie also depicted the frustrations of dealing with bureaucracies and tenured teachers who no longer care because they have been so disillusioned by the system.,1454976000,,594,5.030612244897959

Beyond that, I loved this story of resilience and determination to fix a broken education system. What I didn't like was that it made teachers unions the bad guys. They're not.

5392459,3,B00A7MSQSO,"The movie has an obvious bias with the ""good"" characters always appearing in bright blue lighting while the questionable characters are always displayed in shadowy yellow lighting. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that the issues covered are not black/white but many shades in between. The movie could have been so much more.",1395100800,2,338,5.053571428571429

5392466,4,B00A7MSQSO,"Can you imagine anything more terrifying than watching your child go to a failing school and struggling?  This is happening all over our country.  Teachers who have jobs for life (tenure) really don't have to worry or work any harder.  We can't MAKE people care to do better jobs when they get automatic pay raises across the board...not by merit.  OF COURSE, THAT ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM!!!  This story is about some parents who refused to accept failure on the part of schools.  They did difficult and scary work to take control of their children's schools for one purpose:  to give their children excellence in education.  There can be no better goal because children with great educations will lift up our entire nation that is fighting to compete in a global market.  Very uplifting movie.

5392476,5,B00A7MSQSO,"As a newly-retired teacher, I saw this movie in the theaters and found it to be a wonderful story that showed the best and the worst of education.  After 38 years of teaching, it amazes me that there are still teachers, schools, districts that are lackadaisical and need a good 'kick-in-th-pants' to provide what the kids need.  The actors in this film show the extreme of what can be done, and do such a good job of showing the dedicated and the undedicated in a wonderful profession.  My feeling is, teaching is not just a job where you collect a paycheck -- it's a way to affect the future, hopefully in a good way, and although it's a lot of work it is so fulfilling.  Thanks to the makers of this film and since it was based on a true story -- congrats to the people who did what needed to be done.

5392496,5,B00A7MSQSO,"This is one for family movie night.

While it could have used more time to develop the story and close some holes, it was a movie clean enough to watch with an entire family.

However, younger children under 10 may be bored by the subject content.

I don't recall any bad language.  There were scenes of alcohol drinking, and the mother does work in a bar.  The mother dresses skimpy and does not wear a bra.

The story is based on true events about parents fed up with tenured teachers only being ""in it"" for the pay.  The teachers portrayed in this movie weren't teaching.  They were not concerned with children learning.  And the children would be passed to the next grade without really knowing a whole lot.  Not being able to read was the main topic.

The movie really opened up viewers eyes to the topic of the teachers union backing up their members, but not really caring that their members weren't teaching. As long as the union had the financial support of the teachers they were in business.  If the parents took over the school then how would the union collect dues?  The union's fight was more about job security for the union operators rather than what was in the best interest of the students.

Good family movies are hard to find out there, so when a few come along, grab them up!",1366243200,,1296,4.459574468085107
5392497,4,B00A7MSQSO,"This movie really touch me. It really tells the story of how there are students in school that have learning disabilities or just not ready for the next grade, but would be passed along to the next grade, even if they are not ready for it. The movie would also show that teachers would also check off the students as attending, even if the students were absence to get their funding from the government and not shut down.

I liked how it showed two parents worried that their children would end up being just another statistic in school. So, the parents would not stand for this and decided to do something about it. They decided to to fight back the schools and really got their children the real education they needed. The school and union fought the parents every step of the way. They did more work fighting the parents than they ever did doing their own real duties. They really didn't care for the children education and cared more about their own safety of their jobs more than anything. Why should a child be passed along if they really don't understand or learned the material? The bad teachers there and unions just didn't care about that. They just wanted to kept their jobs! Well, that's not right for the children and I was glad that they were gone and lost their jobs in the end.

I want to tell a little story about myself. I too had a slight learning disability while in school and I was just being passed along ever grade. I remember those days very well. I just didn't get why other kids got things so fast and I was struggling with the material. I never really got the help I needed in school because there was no real special help that I could get in school. No teacher took the time to really asks me if I got it or not. Even, if I flat out got Ds or Fs I would still get to go to the next grade. The schools that I went to just didn't care. This really made it hard for me in life and when I went to college.

I felt I didn't know as much as other people after secondary school and was placed in the remedial classes from the the get go in college, however, I did graduate on time with a high GPA, but it was really difficulty all the way. I had to use all the resources at college and learn from the bottom up and go to professionals open hours ever day it seemed. They actually helped me! I passed! I figured, considering that many people that do go to college without a learning disability and don't graduate - I would say, I'm the lucky! :)",1365465600,,2466,4.231422505307855
5392498,3,B00A7MSQSO,"Won't Back Down starring Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of those films I had high hopes for but ultimately, this drama falls flat. Davis and Gyllenhaal try their hardest to keep this movie above float, but my main problem with this movie is I felt nothing special or important took place. Basically just a bunch of stressed out, unmotivated teachers bickering back and forth. Rosie Perez and Holly Hunter also give good performances, but sometimes even when four top actress' make a movie together, the storyline and plot tends to be nonexistent. There's a touching scene with Davis and her young son towards the end of the movie, that was probably the only time in the film that brought a tear to my eye. Won't Back Down isn't a horrible drama, but I have to admit that it's not really memorable either.

It must be true because this movie presents Charter Schools as the best idea in the history of humanity and Public schools as Satan's best tool for mankind's doom.

Most disappointing was that it wasn't inspirational, it wasn't about the human spirit overcoming adversity.  It was a thinly veiled anti-union hack job.  It over simplifies the issues facing public education.  Believe this movie and getting rid of unions is all you need to fix public education in America.

5392515,3,B00A7MSQSO,"If not for the emotional resiliency of the two lead actresses, this 2012 feel-good drama about the reformation of a failing inner-city Pittsburgh school would come across as no more than a polemic. However, Maggie Gyllenhaal (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>) and Viola Davis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Help/dp/B006G2124E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Help</a>) bring enough intense fervor to their roles of parent and teacher that this becomes a creditable film if not all that memorable. Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Barnz doesn't help matters much by stacking the deck so predictably in the script (co-written with Brin Hill) while tackling a serious exposition problem with a lot of education jargon that feels like it requires the viewer to take some preparation exam to watch it. Watching Davis Guggenheim's 2010 documentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Superman/dp/B004JPVDQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for 'Superman'</a>, is probably helpful since it covers similar territory by showing how students strive to become accepted into a charter school.

The plot here takes a more contrived route as it focuses on Jamie, a single mom holding down two jobs while becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of attention her eight-year-old, Malia, receives from her teachers in treating her dyslexia and dealing with bullies. Through happenstance, she finds a little-known piece of legislation based on California's ""parent trigger"" law, which allows parents and teachers, under certain circumstances and after rounds of approvals, to take over schools and run them entirely. This motivates Jamie to partner with Nona, a teacher at Malia's school, who has similar frustrations from an insider's perspective but has been stymied time and again by the system. The movie then takes us on their journey running through all the bureaucratic red tape that you would expect from an inspirationally-minded drama.

I give credit to Barnz and Hill for at least presenting a compelling argument against the cause by showing how the teachers' union would suffer major setbacks along the way. As Jamie, Gyllenhaal does her best work since her compelling turn as the struggling drug addict-mother in 2006's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherrybaby/dp/B000JBXXYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherrybaby</a>. She brings loose-limbed passion to her character's relentless drive toward realizing a charter school for her daughter. At first, Davis appears underserved by the script, but this actress has no problem conveying the gravitas and compassion needed to make Nona's evolution feel realistic. As Evelyn, the president of the teachers' union, Holly Hunter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadcast-News/dp/B000SW2F44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadcast News</a>) - who would have likely played Jamie a couple of decades ago - brings palpable conviction to her character's increasing moral conflict. It's good to see Rosie Perez (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fearless/dp/B001NASP9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fearless</a>) again onscreen as Nona's sympathetic fellow teacher. Other supporting turns amount to stereotypes as dictated by the script. The subject of the film is quite worthwhile, but the treatment needed far more texture.",1362268800,3,3588,6.831877729257642

5392523,1,B00A7MSQSO,"This film makes for fascinating viewing as a propaganda piece.  The evil teacher's union boss, the teacher who fiddles while her classroom burns; it's a wonder that these straw men don't catch fire before it's over.  There are also a number of serious misrepresentations, to put it generously.  For example, the clear suggestion that teacher union rules prevent teachers from doing any work after 3 pm does not happen in any school system of which I'm aware or have worked in.  From my experience, the rule is more often that teachers, myself included, work well beyond the normal work day, coming in early and leaving late, and never feel we can cover all the bases we want to have covered.  Perhaps one of the film's scummier moments is the quote attributed to teacher union activist Albert Shanker, about not representing children's interests until they start paying union dues.  This quote first showed up in a Mississippi newspaper without attribution/evidence.  There is reason to believe it was floated out there to trash his legacy.  Another serious problem is with the insinuation that public school teachers have tenure.  We do not have tenure, we are not university professors.  Periodically, we face formal evaluations to determine whether we should continue, continue on probation, or face dismissal charges.  By their fifth year, a significant number of public school teachers leave or are dismissed.
  I am not saying public education does not face serious problems, but for a far fairer understanding of the complex issues, check out The Death and Life of the Great American School System, by Diane Ravitch.  And for a fascinating look at how public schools were demonized/blamed for society's ills a century ago, check out Education and the Cult of Efficiency published in 1962 by the University of Chicago Press.",1361059200,4,1830,5.076923076923077
5392524,1,B00A7MSQSO,"The preview is the best part of this movie. The reality is this movie is simple and naive.
A single mom has a daughter w/ dyslexia and her school doesn't help her; a viable story line that ends in a mixture of feel good platitudes.
Maggie Gyllenhaal dances through the film likes she's a wind up toy trying too hard to be sincere. From the beginning we see a school raffle where parents are pit against each other to win seats in an out of district school and naturally our heroine loses the raffle and decides to buck the system. Ving Rhames makes a cardboard cameo as the cliched deep voiced African-American school-administrator-in-a-suit who talks tough (in a deep voice of course) and then disappears never to be seen again.

Gyllenhaal is a ditzy single mom who works as a bartender by night and receptionist by day (by-the-way where is her child's father?) She says she can't afford to move to a better school district but we never hear why that is. So she focuses on the hunky male teacher who she's convinced he's a great teacher b/c he entertaining to the kids.
The reticent teachers who balk at the idea of creating a new school are portrayed as an unruly mob of interrupting, bored fools. The board members who have to vote on the new school idea are shown as non-interested stuffed suits; self-interested or simply not interested.
Holly Hunter is wasted as a once-motivated-school-adminstrator who is now burned out but at the end she will volunteer to teach in the new school.
Nowhere is the obvious mentioned.
-If you want your children to be better students, be better parents. Turn off the TV, take the kids to the library, be a good role model, buy a few books etc.
-If you're a single parent maybe you should move in w/ your parents, family members etc to find a more stable living arrangement for your child.

Unfortunately some people will believe this film is proper reflection of what goes on in big city schools. Too many parents lack the self-esteem to be good role models to their children. they send their kids to the local school and hope for the best. When things go bad parents throw up their hands in despair and throw more money at he schools.

Children are being sent to school but they're not learning anything. A dyslexic little girl is struggling and she gets no help at all. It was disappointing to see educators who didn't care about their students. And the first scene - very bothersome.

Nona and Jamie: I liked the characters, and I was rooting for them till the end. Even though what was going on with the school kept my attention, I was more interested in their personal lives - Nona's family situation, Jamie's relationship with her daughter.

5392543,5,B00A7MSQSO,"This movie is about our pathetic public school system and how the unions are running it into the ground. Keep in mind the role of the unions, keep in mind the famous quote of Albert Shanker, president of the United Federation of Teachers from 1964 to 1985 and of the American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to 1997: ""When schoolchildren start paying union dues, that's when I'll start representing the interests of school children"". Remember who the unions work for. Not for your children!!!

Also keep in mind the city of Detroit. For people who don't know, in the 40's and the 50's, Detroit was one of the most prosperous cities in the US. Where are they now? And the important question is: why and how a magnificent city like Detroit can be destroyed culturally and financially? The answer is: you destroy the public school system, then families move out and the thugs move in and take over. Who destroyed the public school system in Detroit? Well watch the movie. Oakland, Chicago, and Cleveland are next.

Jamie (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a single mother (...what else) who lives in Pittsburgh, works two jobs and takes care of her daughter who has dyslexia. Her daughter doesn't get any help in the school system. In fact, the opening scene represents very well the status of our public education during a normal third grade English class: a teacher sitting at her desk playing on her phone while doing online shopping, ""teaching"" kids who are playing games on their phone or Gameboy that they brought to class while a poor dyslexic girl is trying to read a sentence. The few ""students"" who are not asleep or are not playing on their electronic device are making fun of her. Jamie meets a motivated teacher (Viola Davis) who has her own problems (...of course she is in the process of divorcing) and together they decide to start the process of taking the school over. The story is based on true events that happened in California through which parents can take over a failing public school and turn it into a charter school. The movie happens in Pittsburgh where there are no such laws. Teachers in Pittsburgh, you can relax now...

This film is ""not just a movie"". The script shows really well, the thuggish methods of the unions and the pathetic school board who are playing with poor people's lives while their kids most of the time attend private or charter schools. Holly Hunter plays the role of a remorseful union executive who at first is trying to bribe Jamie and at the end regrets her acts and decides to join the new charter school. This is a weakness of the script (minor) since it is not very believable knowing the union people.

Five stars all around for the acting, the direction and the script that is as close to reality as possible. Parents who have kids in public school will understand.",1358726400,3,2813,4.6767676767676765
5392544,4,B00A7MSQSO,"This is a a good movie, but we shouldn't think that our teachers are the only one that takes care of a child's needs, when it comes to learning we must be willing to teach our children especially when they have difficulties with math, reading and writing and this movie doesn't show either of the mothers really wanting to help their children except when it came to a new school so if this film was somewhat true then mothers are not doing what they can, that's what this movie is saying that it's all the schools and the teachers fault, where does the blame really go?",1358726400,2,569,4.377358490566038
5392545,4,B00A7MSQSO,"I have a son with adhd/dyslexia and I pulled him out to homeschool because the school ""expects"" him to be like everyone else....his self esteme was way down and there was no ""love of learning"".  Now, being homeschooled he is getting ""himself"" back!  This move outlined (a little) how kids are just being pushed through without the tools they need.  Very good!",1358726400,2,359,4.758064516129032
5392546,5,B00A7MSQSO,"It's about a moms' struggle changing the school her daughter goes to. Though it's about more than that too.
The perseverance and determination she shows in the movie is exactly what parents should be like if their kids were not doing so well in school. Education is not something to take lightly and she doesn't. She wants more for her daughter, as most parents do, but stays active in making sure she gets a proper education.
I will admit, the hubby wasn't interested in the film. I say, his loss! It was a great movie, though I can see why the men wouldn't be into it.
By the way, have tissues handy... there is a blubbering moment.",1358640000,3,634,4.427350427350428

5392548,3,B00A7MSQSO,"It is pretty average for the trial inspirational type movie.  The acting was okay, as was the story line, but overall it was the same as every other movie in this genre with nothing to make it stand above the crowd.",1358294400,,215,4.2439024390243905
5392549,5,B00A7MSQSO,"I am biased about this movie because I am seen in a number of scenes along with my Husband,Dad,Sister,Nephew and his Wife. It tells a good story and there was no profanity. We enjoyed it.",1358208000,,187,4.371428571428571
5392550,4,B00A7MSQSO,"It was a good movie with an inspirational story.  Only criticism is it is such a heavy and political topic that the film barely scratched the surface.  If it sparks conversation or research by parents that is awesome!  My only criticism is for Maggie's character she proved to have such an awesome skill set for sales, organization and even completing the tedious paperwork of such bureaucratic red tape that I wondered why she chose to stay ""poor"" and work as a bartender.  That all that time taken from her kid to do this could have been harnessed in a better paying job that would allow her family to move intercity deficits of a public school. The story is false in that this law has never been successful in equipping and changing schools around.  Charter schools are the closest example.  As a parent nothing is more frustrating than witnessing the guarded tenure exploited by bad teachers.  What other job in life guarantees your position even when you suck?!  I felt Maggie G.'s character's frustration with a bad teacher.",1358208000,,1030,4.779661016949152
5392551,4,B00A7MSQSO,"This movie was really good and I felt like these mothers took their kids educations( or lack there of ) into their own hands and made learning so much better for their children.  It felt like the world or the system was against them but, they overcame the odds.  Although, I did love the movie I felt like it ended too soon and would have like to have seen how much better things were ran at the school after all the changes were made.  Overall...I enjoyed it though!",1358035200,2,467,4.284090909090909
5392552,5,B00A7MSQSO,"Filmed in Pittsburgh, the new Hollywood of the east, this film is more fictional than fact. It was inspired by a California law for failing schools. Pennsylvania does not have such a law as yet.

Jamie Fitzpatrick (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a working single mom with a dyslexic daughter (Emily Alyn Lind) who is not getting the attention she needs at school. Unable to move or pay for her child to go to a better school, Jamie joins with a teacher (Viola Davis) in an attempt to take over the school's charter. It is an uphill battle as she must convince apathetic parents. Teachers must also be convinced to give up their union security so they can eliminate substandard teachers with tenure.

The struggles portrayed in the film were light compared to reality. The film is an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie was well acted. Because of the topic, the film engages in some union bashing while trying not to look too anti-union (remember, actors and screen writers are union too).

Tom Petty's song finally comes in during the credit roll.",1358035200,8,1043,4.751381215469613

5392554,5,B00A7MSQSO,"This is a great movie that really shows how schools, bureaucracy and unions are failing for our kids.  Parents need to be the force of change.  Our kids deserve the best.",1357862400,5,170,4.451612903225806
5392555,5,B00A7MSQSO,"This was an amazing story of determination and definitely motivating. While I am not a parent or a teach of special education kids, I have numerous friends that are, and this move pulls at the heart-strings at it shows you what must be done to make sure that kids come first (which should never be forgotten). As someone who has worked in K-12 education as well as a parent, I have seen administrators in some schools that have forgotten this. The movie will open your eyes to some of the issues that are occurring in education today and will open your eyes and your heart to what all of us can do to put kids first and make sure that this is the case where we live too.",1357862400,2,670,4.2421875
5392556,4,B00A7MSQSO,"Great Story.  The movie is a little slow moving but definitely has you inspired by the end, but I am a little sided on this because I originally went to school to be a teacher.  Makes me wish I finished for that.",1357689600,2,212,4.023809523809524
5392557,4,B00A7MSQSO,"Definitely worth watching.  May not watch a second time.

FYI.  My wife did not fall asleep.  That's a sign of a good movie.",1357603200,2,124,4.260869565217392
5392558,5,B00A7MSQSO,"This is a quality film. It engages with problems in our current education system without demonizing either side of reform. It does promote specific change, but looks at a complex system with integrity.
