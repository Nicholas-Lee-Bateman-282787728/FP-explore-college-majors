7794735,5,0876125542,"Paramahansa Yogananda had only one purpose in life: to bring others closer to God and to let each one of us personally experience God in our hearts through his teachings. This DVD gives some vivid accounts about the life of this great Yogi as told by his real and direct disciples. The most important thing in these accounts is to recognise Yoganandas humility, and the fact that he was very human. I have met some people that claim to be his disciples but actually they are anything but, portraying him as infallable and without error. If he had ever advocated such a belief, he would have been as phony as those claiming him to be that way. This great Yogi was like a child at heart, and as you listen to these vivid recollections, hopefully you too will feel his total identification with spirit and be uplifted by these wonderful stories.
