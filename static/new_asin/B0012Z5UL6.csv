This anime is as bad as it gets. If you've seen the trailer and is now convinced to buy, it is misleading.
There is no continuity to the story at all! Everything happens randomly!!!
Since it's only 4 episodes, they never develop the characters at all and plus, there are too many of them!
The entire plot is a total mess, because nothing makes any sense.

[SPOILER ALERT] For example , most of this anime takes place in a virtual reality and there are obviously hackers. The main character is involved in a hacker group, but gets caught by the law enforcement. He works out a deal with them so that he won't go to jail and instead, he will work for the law enforcement to help catch hackers. But the second he joins the law enforcement, he reverts back to his old ways and joins his former hacker group for ""one last hack"". WTF!!! You see anything wrong with this plot? A 5 year old must have wrote this.
On their final hack-job, he gets his hacker leader murdered (because if you die in the Matrix, you die in real life) and he gets away with the hack as if nothing happened. Oh wait ... isn't he in the law enforcement? Wouldn't they be monitoring his activities closely, especially since he was recently detained for his actions? Wouldn't he be scrutinized for his recent actions and be dismissed from the force?
ANSWER: Littered with PLOT HOLES!! [END OF SPOILER]

The actions of the characters are totally unjustifiable and makes me feel dumber for every second I did not turn this stupid series off.
Anything that a character does or if anything happens to a character is irrelevant because we hardly know any background to any of the characters.
There are ""mechas"" in this mini-series, I call them ""mechas"" because they are virtual mechas inside the simulated reality.
But these ""mechas"" lack any originality and hardly appear stylish at all.

This is one of those animes where you'd watch once (that's if you have the patient to finish it) and never touch it again.

I had not heard of this series & I pondered over it a bit before I finally decided ""Eh, What the heck.""  I picked this one up from a third party seller (& brand new) for a little under six dollars (a bit over eight bucks by the time shipping was tacked on).  I didn't have very high expectations, so I was surprised when it turned out to be actually very good.  This is one of those rare little gems that I just happened to stumble upon & left me wondering why I hadn't heard of/run across it long before now.

I will do my best to summerize this series without spoiling it.

Baldr Force EXE is a series about Toru Souma, a hacker who prefers the virtual world of the ""Wire"" to the real world. Toru is a member of a group of hackers that call themselves Steppen Wolf. Yuya, the leader of Steppen Wolf & Toru's close friend, decides that the group should disband because it's getting too dangerous & that it's only a matter of time before FLAK (the military organization in charge of protecting the ""Wire"" from cyber terrorism) catches up with them. All agree that disbanding is a good idea, but that they should  go out in style with one final hack. Unfortunately their last hack ends in tragedy, with the arrest of the members of Steppen Wolf & Toru vowing revenge. Toru reluctantly agrees to joining FLAK in order to not serve any jail time & to keep his friends from serving jail time & also as a way to avenge his friend. While on a misson with his new FLAK teammates, he runs across a girl who seems to know him. Little does he know that this meeting will trigger a chain of events that will link his past to the future of the ""Wire"". Well, this is all you will get from me as far as a summary of the storyline because I really don't want to ruin it for those of you who have not seen it. Sorry. :)

This is a short series consisting of four episodes on one disc. Surprisingly Baldr Force EXE is very well done for being only four episodes. The storyline has a good consistent flow that keeps the watcher interested, the action is not at all lacking & the characters are all very human with normal human emotions.  I will warn you that this does carry a MA (mature) rating. Although the language was fairly tame, there is some female nudity & a slightly disturbing rape scene. The deaths of some minor characters early on are also a bit graphic.  The only ""extras"" are textless songs, trailers of other Funimation offerings & the original preview.  If you enjoy sci-fi & mecha anime, this one is definitely worth checking out.",1274400000,20,2666,4.303393213572854
