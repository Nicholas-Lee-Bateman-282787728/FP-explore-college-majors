8613616,3,B00FA2DE3S,"As an aspiring Lugosi completest, I give this Alpha edition of The Midnight Girl three stars just because it means this title is now easily, cheaply available.  However, be forewarned that this DVD is made from a poor print which does not have the original titles and is about 10 minutes shorter than the old collector vhs I wisely kept. In neither print is the movie really any good.",1418342400,4,384,4.565217391304348
