8150290,5,B000JGWD14,"From the origins of Adams' triumphant HARMONIELEHRE to the controversial production of DEATH OF KLINGHOFFER, HAIL BOP! is an immaculately produced (except perhaps the cheesy opening graphics) DVD encompassing the biography and creative life of John Adams, arguably America's greatest living composer.

Adams' story is fleshed out with behind-the-scenes commentary by frequent collaborators such as Peter Sellars and Alice Goodman, breathtaking American vistas (a little KOYAANISQATSI, if you get my drift), supremely performed and well-filmed musical excerpts by the original artists who first breathed life into Adams' music (and even some new interpretations--Ernst Kovacic's rendition of the VIOLIN CONCERTO is jaw-dropping), and deep and eloquent insight from the composer himself.

A must-own for any fan of John Adams and every practical lover of 20th century music. Enjoy!",1227052800,2,879,5.913385826771654
