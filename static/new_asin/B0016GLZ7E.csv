8262261,5,B0016GLZ7E,"This is, in my opinion, a great anime, the first eppisode is one of my favorites with Fredryk Chopin's Waltz in C# minor. The anime follows a middle school girl named Miu who is a gifted piano student, and she must decide if she wants to participate in a recital performing and originol composition. It is a sweet middle school romance series that spans only three volumes, and in my opinion, it is a really good anime.

If I rember correctly Ludwig Von Beethobven's ""Pathetique"" sonnata is played in exert on a couple eppisodes.

One of my many favorite anime, and in my opinion, worth owning.

The last of the three DVDs.",1301616000,,623,4.544642857142857
