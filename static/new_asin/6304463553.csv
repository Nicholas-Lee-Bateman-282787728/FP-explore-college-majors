7871622,1,6304463553,"...and they got it!  The University of Kentucky, looked forward to a potential repeat in 1997, led by their two superstars, Ron Mercer and Derrick Anderson.  Unfortunately for the Wildcats, Anderson went down early in the season with an ACL tear, leaving Mercer to shoulder the load the entire season.  At the Final Four, Utah utilized a very physical style of play in trying to eke out a win against the Wildcats, who had beaten them in the NCAA tourny in 1996 (and would do so again in 1998).  This physical game left Mercer drained for the championship, giving Arizona the break they needed to take the 1997 NCAA Championship.  As viewers, we were robbed of an outstanding matchup in seeing Derrick Anderson (The man Michael Jordan said he hates to have guarding him) defending against Miles Simon, who had a career game that day.  This video neglects to mention these keys that allowed Arizona to win the tournament in 1997.",1110153600,,928,4.732919254658385

He accelerated the Sacramento Kings to the very brink of reaching the NBA's 2002 Finals. He brought a sense of order and control to the court that was desperately needed for the team. In this video you find out that he has always been stoic, calm and a controlled player, with the fire and determination inside himself to be one of the NBA's greatest players.",1038787200,,460,4.621951219512195
