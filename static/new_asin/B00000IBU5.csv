8157854,1,B00000IBU5,"This DVD of Rodeo Bloopers is not worth the time of Picture please, because this video has the poorest quality picture I have ever seen in a commercially produced product. The entire picture goes light and dark throughout the running. A poor choice, so don't waste your money, or time on this one. It was boring because of the dark and I would not recommend buying this DVD.

Also, another second DVD is Rodeo Bloopers 10 - and rated it a 1 star because there as no zero star option. It was advertised as a great 'party video'. Advertising as a party video is a misrepresentation as I've not attended a party nor thrown a party for 30 min. in duration. Secondly, while I admit I enjoy the thrill of rodeo - an extremely dangerous sport, the events filmed in the video were failures, not bloopers. There were a couple of humorous events, but there was approx. 15 minutes of extremely boring 'acting' by some gentlemen trying to be funny - but they were ridiculous, so also, don't waste your money, or time on Rodeo Bloopers 10.

Both of those two videos sucked so much, I had to throw both of them out in the recycle so I can say, ""That's annoying"" and both were boring and I would not recommend buying both of those two DVDs, they are yucky, dark and light changes, and both are silly crap of bull and there's team roping in Rodeo Bloopers 10, so, forget team roping and just stick with rodeo's only real three main events of calf roping steer wrestling and bull riding as the real true done deal, and let the cowgirls compete with the men in calf roping and bull riding as the real true done deal, got it?

Save more of your time and money on mostly the real four products I recommend of:
