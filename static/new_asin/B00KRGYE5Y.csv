6444608,4,B00KRGYE5Y,"This was funnier than the previous DVD! There are some technical issues like certain episodes have no title and some bumps aren't removed. The packaging says mid-80s, when this actually came out in the late-80s. Besides that, it's good 80's classic.",1412726400,4,249,5.097560975609756

8661032,5,B00KRGYE5Y,"I'm happy that I was able to find this at a store for $5.  I'm 32 and I had to buy it.  Right before coming across this DVD set, I was just thinking about how I miss watching this series.  Then I found it.  I got so excited!  I don't care how old I am.  I will watch it just reminisce one of my favorite cartoons as child.  By watching the episodes, they are as great as what I remembered them.  I know the picture and animation is different from present's cartoons.  But the original episodes of  80's and 90's cartoons.  I'm going to have my niece and nephews watch this...This is a classic.  I only wish the whole series streamed on Netflix or Amazon Prime.  One day I will get the complete series for less than $18 with prime.  I remember that I watched this everyday! I'm glad that they are available on DVD for purchase.",1471392000,,826,4.178343949044586
