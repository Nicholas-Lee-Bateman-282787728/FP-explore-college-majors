371871,5,6301802748,"A companionless Doctor returns to Gallifrey, only to find himself on trial for the assassination of the President.
This is without doubt a true classic.  The nature of the Doctor's people, the Time Lords, is revealed at  last, the storyline is well-thought-out and the decaying Master, in  constant agony but clinging desperately to life in order to destroy his  enemy, is a chilling image.
What really sets this adventure apart from  the crowd, however, are the astonishing sequences in the Matrix.  A horse  with a gas-mask, a surgeon in the desert with a giant hyperdermic needle, a  clown's face looking up from reflective sand - powerful and haunting  Heironymous Bosch-type surrealism.
A top-notch adventure, and one which  belongs in every Dr Who fan's collection.",960163200,2,771,5.145161290322581
371872,4,6301802748,"This is a landmark story in Doctor Who's history - a story that shaped the direction of the show from then onwards, and one that destroyed a few myths while creating others. ""The Deadly Assassin"" is the first in-depth look at the life of the Time Lords and their planet, Gallifrey.  Since their introduction in ""The War Games"" viewers have only seen glimpses of their power and their world. Now Robert Holmes shows us their sheltered, cloistered and bureaucratic way of life. ""The Deadly Assassin"" is a very good story, although some die hard fans of the show would venture otherwise. It is a political thriller and murder mystery - the first episode is excellent (the cliffhanger is astounding!). This story is also remarkable in other ways - it is the first story to feature a companionless Doctor, and hails the return of the Master, last seen portrayed by Roger Delgado before his tragic death in 1973. The charismatic and charming villain of the Pertwee era is here seen as a decayed, emaciated near-corpse, full of hatred and hellbent on revenge. The story has some great moments; most would agree the sequence in the Matrix being the most memorable. This has Doctor Who at its most psychadelic; when the Doctor enters the dreamscape there are some frightfully surreal scenes - the clown, the soldier and horse, and the surgeon, to name a few. The third episode is highly acclaimed, taking place entirely in this computer reality. Personally, I feel it drags on a bit (although I am not denying its substantial impact). I also feel the final episode to be a bit of a letdown after what has happened before. The acting is mostly good - Tom Baker is at his best, in a physical role unusual for his more whimsical Doctor. Of the Time Lords, Chancellor Goth, Cardinal Borusa and Coordinator Engin are terrific. The main letdown is Spandrell - an interesting character marred by a wooden perforance from George Pravda. However, ""The Deadly Assassin"" is a fine story. It is also very controversial - the cliffhanger to episode three arousing the ire of self proclaimed moral watchdog Mary Whitehouse. But it is hardly a violent story, especially not as much as the so called bastions of family values ranted about. This story is classic Doctor Who; brilliantly written and directed, its finer moments outweighing its flaws.",955497600,4,2323,4.836683417085427

371993,5,6301802748,"This is definitely one of the best Doctor Who stories ever.  It's refreshing to see a story in which the Doctor operates without any companion.  The story is very interesting with its glimpses into Time Lord society.  It's also very dark, but that doesn't bother me.  Normally I like dark stuff, as long as it makes sense.  My favorite part was when the Doctor goes into the Matrix, and faces a villain who goes after him in various forms (My favorite one was the last form, in which he hunts down the Doctor like an animal, in an homage to the story The Most Dangerous Game.  That is one homage I can never get enough of.).  It is definitely one of the most exciting scenes in the history of the whole show.",1409097600,,708,4.318181818181818
371994,5,6301802748,"The Doctor arrives home on Gallifrey trying to stop the murder of the Time Lord President. However, he must change his mission to proving his innocence and staving off execution.

The series has some great moments, the suspenseful episode, followed by the Doctor and Castellan trying to get to the bottom of what happened leading to the Doctor entering a mindscape with one of his greatest enemies.

I was kind of between a 4 and a 5 on this one. The last episode is a bit of a let down as within the first few minutes, it feels like the story has ended and it takes a few minutes to get going again, but the Gallifrey parts of the story are incredibly rich and this is one of the first times we really got a good look at the Doctor's home world.

372065,5,6301802748,"The Deadly Assassin is a classic story of Doctor Who, in fact the years that Philip Hinchcliffe produced and Robert Holmes was script editor of the show appear to have had the most classic and best shows of the Tom Baker era!

Robert Holmes wrote an excellent storyline, but more importantly he successfully added many layers to it. The idea of the Matrix where deceased Time Lords brain patterns are held, was terrific, certainly it was borrowed by others later on. Holmes added dimension to the Doctor's home plant Gallifrey and gave a good mixture of legend and history of the planet. He created an intricate society which we really get to see for the first time and he added some fantasic mind boggling scientific concepts which created a real air of mystery and awe. Almost every show of Doctor Who written by Robert Holmes over the series is above average to excellent. It's truly amazing.

Director David Maloney did a great job pulling the story off from the page and turning it into a classic story. The casting is awesome and the production values high. The costume and prop departments all did wonderful jobs filling out the picture of Gallifrey and it's society.

Tom Baker wanted to roam the universe as the Doctor alone and in this show we get to see what that would have been like. It wopuld have been a breath of fresh air personally. Later, when the TARDIS was filled with ""companions"" the show bogged down and became boring. Need I remind you all of Adric!!

The Deadly Assassin will please fans of the Original Doctor Who series as well as Tom Baker fans alike. Excellent, excellent show!",1407024000,2,1607,4.667844522968198
372066,5,6301802748,"this is hands-down my favorite episode (or perhaps i should say story) from the original series.
it's most (in)famous of course for quite another reason. because you see, The Doctor had one truly malevolent adversary, one even more fearsome than the Daleks, the Cybermen, and The Master COMBINED: that queen mother of British media watchdogs, Mary Whitehouse. she and her followers had plenty of other targets, but Whitehouse is still remembered for having a particular grudge against Doctor Who. ASSASSIN is the single episode over which she most passionately got her dander up.
it should be noted that Mrs. Whitehouse's understanding of Doctor Who was clearly even smaller than her enthusiasm for it. her angle was always that the series had been originated as a children's show. (even that isn't quite true. what original producer Verity Lambert had in mind was something the family would watch and enjoy together.) so basically, her greivances always boiled down to the fact that it wasn't Sesame Street. (she was particularly scornful about the way the series ""scares"" the kids, as if there was no middle-ground between Sesame Street and Nightmare On Elm Street.) it was explained to her several thousand times, but she continued to cling to for dear life to the wrong end of that stick. for decades in the U.K. the series was plagued by a misconception that it was strictly kids' stuff, less Star Trek than Pufnstuf. i don't supposed Mrs. Whitehouse started that rumor, but she did more than anyone else to keep it alive. (if the revived series has done any sort of justice to it's ancestor, then it has had Mrs. Whitehouse steadily spinning in her grave like a dynamo from the moment the series premiered.)
interestingly, this, the episode she most passionately lamblasted, is the one that most demonstrats just how dependable her knowledge of the series really was. her major complaint was that one of the cliffhangers was of The Doctor being drowned. (and needless to say, when she stated her case she said ""Doctor Who being drowned,"" fanning the misconception that that's his name.) but as anyone who's been paying attention can tell you, it's a subconscious version of The Doctor in the ethereal ""matrix"" world being pushed under those waves. The Doctor himself is in no literal danger. like all the best media-watchdog prudes, Whitehouse leaves you skeptical as to just how much of the episode she'd actually bothered to watch.
another thing that leaves you wondering is the story itself. what we have here is a very sophisticated political thriller. (one of the most interesting special features compares this story in-depth to The Manchurian Candidate.) for the first time we get a detailed look at the Timelords and their bureacuracy...which is so corrupt and to some degree even ignorant of it's own nature and structure as to make for some pretty good satire as well. so on two counts, hardly the sort of thing you'd expect from the Sesame Street-type series Mrs. Whitehouse wanted it to be. (sorry!! no more plugs for that busybody old prude, i promise.)
in the handful of brief glimpses of the Timelords up to this point they had come off as godlike sentinels who brought order to chaos, but here we learn that they hadn't quite managed to escape chaos themselves. they don't even fully realize how much that messiah of Gallifrey, Rassilon, did for them, how is innovations were still protecting them. according to this story, Rassilon is largely considered a character of folklore, like Paul Bunyon or Baron Munchausen, who's achievements have been rather exaggerated by legend.
it was one of the first 10 or 15 episodes i managed to see, so not a lot of that meant anything to me at the time. what i thought was was so cool was the glimpse of where this Doctor fellow had come from...or should i say fled from? and of course it was my first glimpse of his all-time coolest adversary, The Master. i've already stated that i've never been overfond of the Daleks, and one reason for that is that i've always perferred a single adversary to a gang of nameless ones. i just find the drama more potent that way. with Star Trek, for instance, i got more into the Klingons with The Next Generation because they began to have recurring Klingon characters and explore Klingon culture. and of course while i could take or leave the Daleks, i've always loved their creator, Davros, for being the sort of focussed adversary the Daleks themselves were incapable of being. but i'm running a little off the rails here. whatever the reason, The Master is my all-time favorite of The Doctor's sparring-partners, so i thank THE DEADLY ASSASSIN for introducing him to me.
and for much more as well. this is truly masterfully (pun intended) crafted piece of drama, sci-fi or otherwise. it works so well in fact (and yes, i know i'm not the first one to say this) that The Doctor going solo for once doesn't feel like much of a deviation. that could've been a particular bummer because the sidekick just released was Lis ""Sarah Jane"" Sladen, the single most alluring and engaging companion any Doctor has ever had or is ever likely to have. but then, as some reader is already saying, we can expect nothing less from Robert Holmes, the series' single most lauded scriptwriter. i think it's more a case of the stars lining up and the series just happening to have a good day than Holmes being any sort of human rabbit's foot, myself.
either way please, for You-Know-Who's sake, don't let the Mrs. Whitehouses of this world spoil your fun!",1390435200,2,5536,4.8161764705882355

372073,4,6301802748,"Oddly enough, it would take until the series 14th season of its original run to give a bit of back history into the Time Lord race the Doctor fled from so many years before (with a fairly detailed explanation not given until Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor as to how). Up until the Second Doctor contacted them in his final story The War Games, the Doctor's race went unnamed for six seasons. And in that story, we're give only a mere glimpse into who they were. Even during the Third Doctor's era, the only explanation we're given about them is through the third incarnation -one marooned on Earth until the events of the Three Doctors allowed the Doctor to finally roam in space and time. So he was a bit biased then.

What is great about The Deadly Assassin is writer Robert Holmes often witty script. Holmes was perhaps one the best scribes the TOS ever had, and his subversive style, his dark humor, and well plotted stories, with genuinely fleshed out characters made his serials always the best within the canon of Doctor Who. Then add Tom Baker's ability to improvise, and you ended up with an even better story.

There are many firsts in this serial, including the introduction of Rassilon, who along with Omega (see The Three Doctors) help create time travel and the Time Lord society. This was also the first time it was noted that Time Lords had a limited number of regenerations -that being twelve. This also the only serial in TOS where the Doctor has no companion -having left Sarah Jane on Earth in the previous story. While Leela would arrive in the next story, this was a unique in the series history.

But we get to see Time Lord society, and like any good science fiction, it mimics reality. We are given a glimpse here -and eventually fleshed out in later serials (The Invasion of Time, Arc of Infinity, The Trail of a Timelord) and the new series - that the Time Lord's are a stagnated ceremony-bound oligarchy and that their past has descended into myth and legend.

So here was the beginning -for old and new fans, because this is also a great introductory serial as well.",1359936000,,2093,4.573333333333333

372126,4,6301802748,"""The Deadly Assassin"" fell between Elisabeth Sladen's last story as Sarah Jane Smith and the introduction of Louise Jameson as Leela, giving Tom Baker a chance to stretch his legs as Doctor Who without a companion. The result was one of the most smartly scripted, tight action adventures of the Fourth Doctor's tenure, thanks in large part to the veteran writing skills of script editor Robert Holmes.

At the end of the Doctor's previous adventure, ""The Hand of Fear,"" the Time Lords summon him to Gallifrey. After bidding farewell to Sarah Jane and setting course for his home planet, the Doctor has a premonition of Gallifrey's president being assassinated in the Panopticon, a sort of senate chamber. While trying to prevent the president's assassination, the Doctor is caught with a planted rifle, making it appear he is responsible for the fatal shooting.

Placed on trial for murder, the Doctor invokes Article 17 of the Gallifreyan constitution and declares himself a candidate for president in the emergency election scheduled in two days' time, a move that temporarily grants him legal immunity. In the meantime, he must prove his innocence to Castellan Spandrell (George Pravda), an ingenious and sympathetic official responsible for investigating the president's murder. Pravda was a Czech actor who brought an intelligent, continental European flavor to the role. Veteran BBC character actor Bernard Horsfall returns as the president's likely successor, Chancellor Goth, after playing one of the Time Lords who exiles the Doctor to Earth in 1969's ""The War Games.""

""The Deadly Assassin"" is a rich political satire that borrows imagery from ""The Manchurian Candidate"" but none of the 1962 movie's preposterous nonsense about hypnosis and brainwashing. (This was perhaps because producer Philip Hinchcliffe wanted to copy the look and feel of the paranoid political thriller but had never actually seen it.)

Part Three prefigures ""The Matrix"" as the Doctor enters the virtual reality of Gallifrey's computational matrix to discover the assassin's identity. This ground-breaking episode, which attracted 13 million viewers, consists almost completely of the Doctor's nearly dialogue-free struggle for survival against an anonymous foe. The episode drew especial fire from Mary Whitehouse and the fanatics of her conservative watchdog group, the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, for its supposedly excessive violence. Whitehouse and the NVALA caused a public-relations headache for the BBC that would eventually lead to a major toning-down of the series.",1312329600,2,2578,5.502525252525253
372127,4,6301802748,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewers here that ""The Deadly Assassin"" is something of a lynchpin for Doctor Who affectionados.  And, as always, the episode was excellent.  That said, however, I found this to be the least coherent and most cumbersome episode of Doctor Who I've ever seen.  While the central plot - the Master once again seeking revenge against the Doctor - is clear; and the Presidential assassination as a ploy to get the Doctor where the Master wanted him makes perfect sense; I have to question, not the Master or his motives, but the story's writer.  There's absolutely nothing to suggest that the Master intended from the beginning to entrap the Doctor inside a dream sequence; if anything, that part - which ends up being the crux of the story - comes off as merely an afterthought which has no tangible relationship to anything that went before or came after it.  So, as exciting as it was, this sequence just seems like something inserted at the last minute to fill up running time.  It's what I would call ""inorganic"" in that it doesn't proceed naturally or logically from the story's beginning or lead naturally to the story's conclusion.  In truth, the entire story hangs on Chancellor Goth's desire to become President; yet that entire dynamic comes off as merely window dressing.  Like I say, it's Doctor Who, so it's head and shoulders above most other TV fare; but far from the best Doctor Who has to offer.",1283472000,,1442,4.763052208835341

The Doctor bewildered by this strange vision realizes that no Time Lord has sent for him.  Now he must figure out who did and why he is the one killing the Lord President.
  Soon enough he dodges the guards and the Castellan only to find himself in the very same postion he saw in his vision.  The Doctor is yet again on trial and his only way out is to run for Lord Preisdent.  With little time left and those kicking at his heels for his death the Doctor has to figure out who is behind this and who would make a pawn of The Doctor or its over for all of them.",1260144000,,814,4.0754716981132075

372131,5,6301802748,"What's great about the ""Deadly Assassin"" is that, after 33 years, this episode is still relevant to the ""Doctor Who"" universe.  In this story, the Doctor returns to his home planet of Gallifrey -- for the first time since the planet had been named a few years earlier, in<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Time-Warrior-Episode-70/dp/B00114XLYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Time Warrior (Episode 70)</a>.

What writer Bob Holmes did for Gallifrey and the Time Lords in this story re-wrote what we knew before, and introduced concepts such as Rassilon and the Eye of Harmony that are still in play in today's ""Doctor Who"" universe.

The Doctor's been summoned home to witness the resignation of the Time Lord's President.  He quickly learns that an assassination attempt is planned, and when he's unable to prevent the crime, he's instead accused, arrested and threatened with execution.  However, the Doctor escapes into the virtual reality of the Time Lord Matrix, and tracks down the true killer -- only to learn that the murder of the President is only the opening volley in a scheme that might destroy Gallifrey once and for all.

Although elements of the production design behind ""The Deadly Assassin"" are dated today, the story was at least a decade ahead of its time with the extended virtual reality sequence in Part Three.  The script also features elements of political conspiracy thriller (one DVD featurette compares the story to an earlier such thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Manchurian-Candidate-Special-Edition/dp/B00020X88Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)</a>), buddy-cop movie, and -- when we learn in this story how the Time Lords came to be in the first place -- creation myth.

The special features on the disc aren't quite as fabulous as the story itself.  The commentary booth is filled out by Tom Baker, show producer Phillip Hinchcliffe, and guest actor (and the story's secondary villain) Bernard Horsfall.  Baker's and Horsfall's actor reminiscences are a bit hazy, this story having been made in 1976.  The pop-up production notes are here written by a seeming newbie to the 2 Entertain team don't really touch properly on the firestorm that this story inadvertently created back in its day -- the notes do briefly hint on a right-wing ""viewers' association"" that complained about violence within the virtual reality sequence, but don't provide enough context from a 2009 perspective.  Instead the notes talk about the use of poison darts throughout history.  If you need it.

Threre are two interesting extras on the disc: one is a 16-minute exploration of what makes ""Doctor Who"" scary; this features some of the shows scariest moments from its inception in the 1960s right up through the modern-day revival.  The other is an interview with an aging fan named Jan Vincent-Rudzski, whose scathing 1977 fanzine review of this story set the bar by which all other insular, narrow-minded reviews of ""Doctor Who"" stories are now measured.",1252281600,,3615,6.072691552062868

But as he later finds out it was a trap set by his old enemy, the Master, who is on his last life and is now dying and disfigured. The President is dead, and the Doctor accused of killing him. Now to save both his life and Gallifrey, he must enter the dream-like world of the Matrix where if he dies there, he dies in real life (now you know where Hollywood got their idea for ""The Matrix"" movies). In the Matrix, the Doctor finds himself in a fight to the death against a mysterious masked killer who has complete dominion over the Matrix and keeps manipulating the odds at every turn. It ends with a climatic battle between the Doctor and the Master over the very survival of Gallifrey itself.

This was a great ""Doctor Who"" story, but it did have its problems. Part Two's cliffhanger is a joke, some of the early scenes in the Matrix were a bit dull such as the train and the clown, and I did not like the fact that the Doctor is companionless in this one either. But other than that, this was a pretty damn good one. This is really like a political thriller. The plot is brilliant (as they usually are when Robert Holmes is the writer), it starts out with a great deal of mystery in Parts One and Two, and Parts Three and Four are action-packed, the acting and directing are top-notch, the special effects are pretty good too, and you learn a lot about Time Lord history and their society in this one as well. In all, I would highly recommend this one to any true Whovian!",1247356800,,2137,4.393939393939394
372216,5,6301802748,"This is one of the more important episodes of Doctor Who in terms of enlightening us about Gallifrey and Time Lord society. This episode expands on ideas from ""The Hand of Omega"". We get more information about Rassilon and his masterpiece, The Eye of Harmony. This is also quite possibly one of the best crafted episodes in terms of pitting The Doctor against The Master. Some find the ""dream sequence"" boring but it is, in fact, an interesting comment on psychological warfare. This episode also make the transition between the Sarah-Jane Smith era and that of Leela the Barbarian. Anyone who wants to be a serious Doctor Who fan absolutely must become familiar with this episode!",1246838400,4,681,4.879310344827586
372217,5,6301802748,"Every once in a while a TV show decides to put out something different and special, perhaps for better ratings or to stir up the stagnant continuity. In many ways, this is Doctor Who's big moment, smack dab inbetween the two most memorable companions of the Fourth Doctor, and running during the show's midpoint, the 13th anniversary.

Many things make this story stand out from the others-- the Doctor has no companion; the journey to his homeworld for the first time since ""The War Games""; the colorful High Council costumes; the unusual method by which the Doctor gets out of his death sentence; a decrepit and decaying foe from the past...

But even with these things, what will strike today's viewers the most is that this story contains the first ever mention of a virtual world called THE MATRIX, some 20+ years before it was shamelessly ripped off for a movie.

I wasn't bothered by the controversial ""drowning"" incident as much as by the unresolved plot holes that dot the story like singularities. I won't bother the reader with excruciating details, but they'll be easy enough to find. However, this story shines on its own just for being different and is a real treasure.

This is where Tom Baker gets his wish-- to appear in a story with no companions-- and as a result he is surrounded by them the rest of his scarfbearing days. He also gets to narrate, which he doesn't do again until ""Shada"".

I would recommend this story to anyone wanting to know more about the Doctor's homeworld. Of course, no single story contains everything you might need to know, so I would also recommend ""The Invasion of Time"" as a companion piece.",1244592000,25,1641,4.70383275261324
372218,5,6301802748,"Not only is this story well written, but because it takes place on Gallifrey, it adds to the background and lore of the Time Lords.

It is now a fairly common theme in Sci-Fi, where a charactor enters a computer Matrix, but in 1976 this was a newer concept. The best scene of the episode is the one in which the Doctor fights an opponent in the Neural net. The neural net is explained as a network of all the knowledge made up from the minds of Timelords. It is not living but the Doctor's mind is, and if he loses the battle while in the network it would kill him.

The show is really not dated even today, because there are not a lot of tech effects in it. They relied on good studio sets, costumes and a very strong supporting cast.

This show had the controversial freeze frame cliff hanger that showed the Doctor's head being submerged under water.

The acting was superb and the story grips all the way to the end. There is a real sense that the Doctor has perhaps met his match in this one.",1179964800,,997,4.204188481675392
372219,5,6301802748,For my money this is far and away the best episode of Doctor Who.  It is definitely Tom Baker's finest work on the series.  This episode is also one of the darkest and most violent of the entire series with plenty of political intrigue.  The writing is first rate.  Definitely worth buying.,1159660800,,290,4.519230769230769
372220,3,6301802748,"This episode is unique among all of Tom Baker's many outings as the Doctor because it is his only turn without a companion. Apparently it came off because following Liz Sladen's departure at the end of ""Hand of Fear"", Baker wanted to try a one-man show for fun and the prodcuers agreed - provided everybody understood it was a one-time-only thing. The result is ""The Deadly Assassin"" an entertaining and very revealing episode which takes the Doctor, all by his lonesome, back to his home planet of Galifrey to tangle with his oldest enemy, The Master.
""Assassin"" has a lot of unusual qualities. In addition to the solo appearance of the Doc, it is an unusually physical and violent episode, and also sheds some light on the society of the Time Lords and on Doctor's (delinquent) youth on Galifrey.
In this episode, the Master has passed his twelfth and supposedly final regeneration, and is now basically a disgusting animated cadaver. He lures the Doctor back home by planting a vision in his mind of the assassination of the Lord President of Galifrey, but when the Doctor returns to foil the plot, he not only fails but becomes the prime suspect. Scheduled for execution (""Vaporization without representation is tyranny!"") he has just twenty-four hours to expose not only the real assassin but discover who is pulling his strings.

Much of the episode takes place in a disturbing 'dream reality' in which the Doctor battles Garth, the Master's homidical power-grasping flunky, who stupidly believes serving the Master will lead to something other than a horrible death. The dream reality is more of a nightmare: part swamp, part quarry, part fog, and all ugly. The final confrontation between the Doctor and Garth in the swamp is graphically violent, at least by ""Who"" standards, and caused some controversy in Britain when it was first aired. Of course, when the Doctor comes back to reality, he still has the Master to deal with, and this rotting, robe-clad version, unlike the previous (and later) portrayers, has all of the viciousness, egotism, and homididal mania we expect from the character with none of his usual charm or humor. What is it about putrefying while still alive that takes all the spring out of a man's step?
""Assassins"" is an enoyable episode, but unusually dark, and its very premise -- having the Doctor operate without a companion -- works against it to a degree. Somehow the show's formula doesn't achieve the right chemistry without this missing element; it helps to have a ""fish out of water"" for the Doctor to play off of (and rescue), not to mention to divide screen time with. It was an interesting experiment, and helped serve as an interlude between the departure of Sarah with the arrival of Leela, not to mention set up the Master's return in a less decrepit form later on, but I'm glad that during Baker's run at least, one experiment in this direction was enough. Three and a half stars.",1062547200,12,2929,4.834661354581673
372221,5,6301802748,"""Through the millennia, the Time Lords of Gallifrey led a life of peace and ordered calm, protected against all threats from lesser civilizations by their great power.  But this was to change.  Suddenly and terribly, the Time Lords faced the most dangerous crisis in their long history.""
So begins the only story where the Doctor is without a companion.  After seeing the assassination of the president in a precognitive vision, in which he is the assassin, the Doctor lands on Gallifrey and is ordered arrested by Castellan Spandrell.  He leaves a note warning them of the assassination, eludes the bumbling Chancellery guards, led by the [fool] Hildred and tries to stop the killing to no avail.
The Doctor buys time by invoking Article 17 of the constitution, in which he announces his candidacy for the presidency.  He has the Castellan, an open-minded Time Lord who is a ""simple seeker of the truth,"" as an ally.  He tells the Doctor:  ""I believe you are going to be executed for it [the assassination]""
His old teacher, the jurist Cardinal Borusa, defends the Doctor's use of Article 17 against Chancellor Goth, who as interim leader, wants the Doctor executed.  He says to Goth, ""All presidents are faced with difficult decisions.  It is by their decisions that they are judged.""  It's when the shrunken body of the PR announcer's soundman is found in the camera that the Doctor recognizes the Master's trademark method of killing.
The latter part of Episode 2 and all of Episode 3 are spent in a dreamland of the Matrix, where the Doctor battles an unknown adversary--the Master's champion.  He carries on, saying, ""I deny this reality.  The reality is a computation matrix.""  Weird and surreal scenes, such as eyes appearing on a cliff face, a WWI soldier in gas mask, machine guns rattling, and even a Samurai warrior appear.
Funny Tom Baker lines:  ""Extraordinary.  The roof's still on.  I could have sworn it fell on me.""  To Hildred:  ""I confess you're a bigger [fool] than I thought you were.""  To Spandrell:  ""Vaporization without representation is against the constitution!""
The prelude, spoken by Tom Baker after the opening titles, has another context given the events of 11 September.  Other quotes from this story that lend credence to this connection:  Borusa:  ""We live in evil times.""  and he also says in reaction to Goth's reactive move for a swift trial:  ""This is a time to reflect, for passions to cool.""  and ""A violent action is causing an opposite and violent reaction.""  If only these lines were applied...
Other elements this story incorporates is the Manchurian Candidate, the JFK assassination, and the investigation of a conspiracy.  And then there are term limits.  An aging Time Lord remembers a president who served for 900 years, saying:  ""Now they're chopping and changing every couple of few centuries.""
This is one of the most important stories in the series' history, as we get a more detailed look at Time Lord society.  We learn what the Matrix is, the lifespan of Time Lords, and the three chapter and associated colours of Time Lords.  Prydonians may seem devious but as Goth says, ""we simply see a little further ahead than most.""  There are links to past stories, such as the Doctor's trial (The War Games) and acquittal (The Three Doctors).
Much of the Doctor's time is spent with Spandrell and Coordinator Engin, who assist him in his quest to exonerate himself.  They make a good team.  Spandrell is the tough-minded and sarcastic one, while Engin has the personality of a chatty and friendly librarian.  The Doctor has the rational and imaginative quality they lack.  Both George Pravda (Spandrell) and Eric Chitty (Engin) bring their characters alive, with refreshing personalities.
One of the most important stories in the series' history, where we get a bigger view of Time Lord society.  Surely Robert Holmes' masterpiece.",1021766400,12,3880,4.9489164086687305
372222,5,6301802748,"This episode made Tom Baker Dr. Who more than any other.  He carries the character alone to his home world and opened up a line of plots that would turn out great stories in the future.
The supporting cast does well and the episode flows.  If you were to buy a single tape to figure out if Dr. Who is for you this is the best choice.
Well written, well plotted and well acted you will enjoy yourself as the Doctor throws his own people one curve after another to save the day.",1008460800,,476,4.10752688172043
372223,5,6301802748,"Finally. No more sidekicks or distractions. No silly sub plots about stuff not relevant to the central story. No hysterical damsels to rescue, no ridiculous contraptions to rig, and no ubiquetous Alien Menace or Killer Robot or other sort of threat run amok. Finally, a story that seems to be more about the character of the Doctor than about using him as a storytelling device. Doctor Who follows the Time Lord's summon back to Gallifrey and finds himself caught up in a complex weave of murder and deception unleashed by The Master, a villain so worthy of The Doctor that Baker even concedes ""He's absolutely brilliant - he's almost on my level"" ... of mathematics. I actually see a lot of little pokes at the Warren Comission and House Select Comittee on Assasination's probes into the JFK enigma in the opening acts. But the ""money melon"" section of this adventure is where the Doctor enters the so-called Matrix to do battle with the Master's patsy in a kill or be killed deathmatch worthy of a Walter Hill movie. It is simply one of the best sequences from the history of the Who series, and the various acts of the adventure allow Baker to shine forth as an actor capable of several roles -- action hero, crime sleuth, scientific wizard and, above all, a Man who keeps his sense of humor even when being tortured. A must have for any serious Who fanatic and a great introduction to Baker's character -- why not start with the best? Very highly recommended.",1007164800,3,1463,4.652509652509653
372224,5,6301802748,"The Deadly Assassin is the only Dr. Who seriel to feature the Doctor alone, with no companions to serve as a stand-in for the audience.  As such, its probably not the best video to use as an introduction for the world of Dr. Who.  However, it is a wonderful treat for those who are already fans.  For the first time, the society of the Doctor's home planet of Gallifrey is seriously examined (after being broadly hinted at in The War Games and Three Doctors) and, as opposed to later episodes where the Time Lords became the equivalent of a bunch of old fuddy duddies, here they are a truly fascinating race of God-like men whose fatal combination of ennui and arrogance has managed to create a world full of both hidden evil and benevolence.  The Doctor, summoned back home, finds himself accused of assassinating Gallfrey's President and battles his old enemy the Master (seen here in the midst of decay and as a truly malevolent force as opposed to the almost farcially melodramatic villian he would later be reduced to).  Strongly acted and directed, the Deadly Assassin was Dr. Who at its best with a truly intriguing story (one that put the fantastic into fantasy as it were) and a strong plot combined -- but not overcome -- with several nicely quirky bits (the officiously bland Gallifrey newsmen convering the President's assasination being a highlight) that were a trademark of the Tom Baker years.  For those of us who remained loyal to the show even when it sometimes seemed it may have lost its way, the Deadly Assassin was (and is) a wonderful reward.",1005782400,,1565,4.693430656934306

7816206,5,6301802748,"This is a very unique adventure for the Doctor in that he goes it alone without a companion but he does have the assistance of others.
It is admittedly a takeoff on The Manchurian Candidate but the Matrix segments remind me of The Prisoner surreal TV series and the classic Star Trek episode Shore Leave, maybe the Space:1999 episode The Rules Of Luton too.
I don't find this vision of Gallifrey all that impressive. It seems to have much more pomp and circumstance in the Invasion Of Time story.
I am taken aback by the maturely sophisticated script and it's graphic nature. Very realistic.
The Master character is a lot like the decomposing host of Tales From The Crypt, especially the original E. C. Comics version. Very evil, very nasty.
He has a fantastically insidious plan to regenerate himself by any means necessary and nearly succeeds in destroying everything and everyone including himself, fool that he is.
He fakes his death towards the end and the character Cardinal Borusa voices the need to 'adjust the truth' to save the face of the Time Lord Goth, who assisted The Master in his diabolical plan.
Of course The Master is not dead and slips away in his grandfather clock Tardis.
Before the Doctor leaves Gallifrey Borusa expresses his sarcastic relief and says, 'Doctor....9 out of 10.', and grins.
A nice touch.

A great adventure overall, extremely well done!
It is a very apt allegory for the dysfunctional nature of politics and Elitist morals.
Adjustment Of Truth is a common practice now, unfortunately.

Maybe it always has been.
