1622680,4,B00005LKI9,"When viewing ""Time and Tide"", here's a good word of advice for you: don't think too long about the plot.  Despite having holes in logic and plot, this is one of those action films that doesn't want to get boggled down in the details.  The story as it is involves a young bartender who happens to have everything going bad for him from the start.  He gets a cop pregnant (who doesn't really like playing with the opposite sex, if you get my meaning) and she immediately hates his guts.  But, he decides to help out by taking a job at a bodyguard agency (run by a loan shark, no less) and happens to gain a friend who's an in-law of one of the clients the agency is protecting.  Everything's going great, until he meets his friend's former associates (as in gun-toting, vicious mercenary type ""associates"") and ends up having to fight to stay alive.  One thing this movie's got in spades is action.  There are sequences in this film that are thoroughly unbelievable (such as a cat-and-mouse game in a tenement building, a brutal robbery during a tropical storm, and a showdown inside a stadium).  It's a film that teeters between romantic comedy and hard-boiled action, and despite seeming to miss a scene or two (watch the trailer on the DVD for evidence) and having a very interesting DVD commentary with director Tsui Hark, ""Time and Tide"" is at least worth a rental for Hong-Kong action buffs.  This one easily blows away a lot of the current crop of summer action epics.",998006400,,1473,4.570342205323194
1622681,1,B00005LKI9,"I love the rampant genius of director Tsui Hark, but this movie was the abysmal pitts.  Maybe fans of his other terrible ""American"" films will go for this one, but those that love his older works will scratch their head with disappointment.",997315200,,240,4.714285714285714
1622682,5,B00005LKI9,"This has to be one of the best movies i have seen. And believe me i have seen everything from 2 beat Shaw Brothers kung fu movies to classic Yuen Woo ping movies to Tsui Hark classics, to graphic horror/animation movies(ricki oh) then to John woo's classics. I have seen everything and this has to be my favorite. I rented this movie expecting a new stylish Kung Fu film, but i came out with one of the best Gun-fu action films i have ever seen. when i first rented it i watched it twice in a row. But don't rent this movie expecting Once upon atime in china kung fu action. Think of this as a more hip modern Hard Boiled with maybe a teaspoon of kungfu. But don't make the same mistake as i did renting  this and another movie, and if u do watch this movie second, because most likely the other vieo won't compare to this, lime me i couldn't watch my other rental because it would ruin the greatness of this. And the two real good stars in this are Couto Remotigue jr.(the villan) and Wu bia the real star. ENJOY!!!!!!!(and if ur having trouble between picking Tokyo raiders and this, PICK THIS OVER IT DO URSELF THE FAVOR)",997142400,2,1124,4.276995305164319
1622683,5,B00005LKI9,"Alright, this is not for movie goers that are big on plot and character.  Still, for people that are looking for a great action movie, this is the place to look. It always amazes me when Hollywood imports directors and they make terrible movies here (see: John Woo, Tsui Hark, etc) and still manage to make excellent movies in their native countries.  Time and Tide is an excellent example of this, it is stylish, well paced, and easy to watch. The plot surrounds a bartender who gets an undercover lesbian cop pregnant during a one night stand.  Nine months later, she's expecting and he's become a bodyguard to try and raise money for her and his child, even though she wants nothing to do with him.  Also in appearance is a mercenary friend of his and his pregnant girlfriend.  The plot from here on out is sketchy at best, but you never care.  The movie moves forward with such drive and intensity, that you never stop to think about the details. The DVD presentation is crisp and clear, with amazing sound and visuals which really do justice to the use of color.  Tsui Hark's eye is flawless and old-school action fans will appreciate the spare use of camera tricks and CGI which really allow the action to be seen (and you have to wonder in awe at many of the stunts that these guys actually do instead of thinking, ""wow, that's some great special effects). The DVD is sparse on extras, but it does include an interesting commentary by the director.  Still, the movie is reason enough to purchase this flick.  Definitely, HK action movie fans and US movie fans that are tired of the barrage of expensive special effects in place of real creativity will love this movie.",997142400,8,1675,4.575250836120401
1622684,5,B00005LKI9,"Wow~~ I waited for this movie soooo long and finally was still amazed by it! Tsui Hark really proved with this that he really is one of the greatest Filmmakers alive! Those of you disappointed with his Hollywood Films should watch this :)
The movie features interesting characters (from the leads Nic Tse and Wu Bai over people like their girlfriends and Anthony Wong to ""The Angels""). You really get some kind of attached to them and the film does not get boring when there is no action scene. Also the cinematogrophy and overall camera techniques are superb. You can see that Tsui Hark really tries new things and tries to improve. Something John Woo should do too!
The Story may seem to be a little bit loose, but the part that is most important of this movie ist the Action! Hung Yan Yan (aka Xiong Xin Xin) does a hell of a job with his action choreography that is really creative and superb! It's a pity that he didn't get the HK Award for the Best Action Design (it went to Crouching Tiger, which is ok, though I think Time And Tide would have really earned it, because it delivers a new style and is inspirative!). You may know Hung Yan Yan as the ""Tattowated"" from The Blade or as ""Club Foot"" from OUATIC3. But what is important here, is that he kicks ass!
The best shootout is a fight in a big appartment Block where they actually fight BETWEEN the houses! That fight is larger than life!! And also the ""in-house-fighting"" in this scene is supreme. Wu Bai is sooo cool! =)
To summ everything up in some sentences: This movie rockz and the action can easily keep up with ""John Woo Action"" from HK. The story itself is interesting too and gives an good conclusion. The Cinematogrophy and camera angles are also one reason one should see this movie!
Simply: A MUST SEE EVENT!!!",994032000,14,1784,4.458715596330276
1622685,5,B00005LKI9,Following the wave of Hidden Tiger Crouching Dragon many Hong Kong action films have been flooding the US market but few have been as mindblowing as Time and Tide. It saw a limited run in theaters (one weekend)but it had a dramatic effect on those who watched it. I highly reconmend this film to vets of hongkong action and newbies alike this it truly one of the best fillms to come out of Hong Kong since Hard Boiled. Brian Mitchell The Peoples Champion,993427200,3,454,4.481927710843373
1622686,4,B00005LKI9,"This should be regarded as a Hark Tsui film. Just a reminder, Tsui entered the Hollywood arena with ""Double Team"" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and a few titles with Jet Li.
Not that it's a earth-shattering title, but ""Time & Tide"" does have its merit and I'm just going to stay on the merit.
This is a story with a nice tie with the beginning and end scene that says the nature of men is good. That's nice, or nice enough. Inside this coating, is an action-packed feature film that reminds me heavily of ""Die Hard"", actions based around elite force being bad guys, and a good guy that somehow (incredibly) negotiate around all the tight corners. For some reason, personally, I feel Tsui wants to show the movie-goers that he's a bit better than John Woo.
Okay, it's an action film with a drama coating, but ultimately it has a flare of reality with Tse's character, someone silly enough to believe that a air-gun can make a difference. It's almost unfair to say this is Tsui's statement that he's better than Woo, but if you just want a lot of action-excitment, maybe you'd understand.",992131200,,1087,4.579487179487179
1622687,4,B00005LKI9,"Tyler wants to escape his current life and run off to a distant place. ...as well as everything else you see mentioned in the other reviews here. For the bulk of the story, he's working for an unlicensed bodyguard service. During one of the bodyguard jobs, he meets Juan who belongs to the ""Angels"" - a group with military-type training. Tyler's life gets more complicated afterwards.
This movie has some wonderful action sequences - especially the scene in the apartment complex as Juan jumps and rappels between the floors. The movie may have some flaws here and there, but it's still very enjoyable.
The DVD does provide a director's commentary and trailer but not much else. I would recommend watching this in Chinese with subtitles. For some reason, in the English dubbed version, they didn't dub the Spanish dialogue. I haven't watched the entire movie with the English track so I can only say that most of the Spanish seems to be translated only in the subtitles.
If you don't mind subtitles, I would highly recommend this movie to fans fo action films. If you prefer dubbed versions, just be aware of the untranslated Spanish parts.",1053734400,4,1140,4.821428571428571
1622688,5,B00005LKI9,"I saw this on cable about four times all I can say is wow. I mean the tenement scene alone is well worth the purchase and for the ladies the lead star is very cute to boot. It's been a while since I saw it, but some movies have you reeling for days this is one of them.",1050624000,3,269,3.6551724137931036
1622689,3,B00005LKI9,I have seen a ton of HK acioners and this one is only average. The story is hard to follow and the main protaganist is a wimp and carries a phony gun around the entire movie relying on his buddy to save him. There is some good gunplay but even that is hard to follow at times. If you want something better watch Hard-Boiled and see how its done. Tsui Hark has made better than this also.,1033084800,,387,4.038961038961039
1622690,4,B00005LKI9,"Time and Tide is one of those movies that will entertain you every time you watch it. I bought this movie fairly recently and have watched it at least five times already, 'cause it's that [darn] good.
The story starts out simple, but then evolves into something much more than just a typical HK action plot. I could spoil it for you right now and tell you the whole story like other reviewers here have, but then I'm not that stupid. Time and Tide is a movie that you must experience with knowing little as possible going in in order to take in everything.
The action can be summed up in one word: STYLISH. The gun fights are shot in a way that seems almost artistic. The bullets and bodies fly through the air with such style that it puts new meaning to ""Poetry in Motion"". Although I was expecting more martial arts/hand-to-hand combat (don't get me wrong, there are a few scuffles along the way, but if you're a fan of Jackie Chan like me, then you might be a little disappointed), the epic gun battles seemed more appropriate for the grim story. In other words, the action, like the movie itself, is something you must see to believe.
Time and Tide isn't for everyone, but for fans of HK action movies, you won't be disappointed.",1028419200,5,1233,4.436123348017621
1622691,1,B00005LKI9,"This is perhaps to most overated Hong Kong action flick I have seen. Everyone of my friends told me how good this action flick was and since Eggbert and Older gave it two thumbs up, I decided to give it a try. I was very saddened. The story is very stupid and exaggerated. They even have spanish speaking Asian assasins in this flick(they speak as fluently as any spanish speaker)which makes it even cornier. But like most action movies is not so much about the story it's about the action, and that's what I anticipated. But the action didn't thrill me like it did in such action flicks such as ""Hard Boiled"" ""Face Off"" or even ""The Black Mask"". Believe me, if you like John Woo or Robert Rodriguez you have seen a lot of ground broken in action, and this movie doesn't even come close to that. Tsui Hark doesn't come close to accomplishing what his former best friend John Woo has done. In this film Tsui Hark recycles the action of films like the lackluster ""The Big Hit"", and ""Way of the Gun""(except Time and Tide had no blood). Heck, this movie reminded me so much of the atrocious ""Big Hit"" just with more uninspired action sequences. I continue to ponder how people were so amazed by this movie, I guess they never seen a John Woo flick. But believe me if you are interested in checking out this movie please watch ""Hard Boiled"" or even ""Desperado"" instead. But if you like embarrassing movies like ""The Big Hit"" or ""Way of the Gun"" go ahead.",1027468800,,1449,4.430711610486892
1622692,4,B00005LKI9,"Pay attention to this film or it will leave you behind with the intensity and speed it moves at.
Tyler (real life Chinese musician Nicholas Tse) plays, who works at a bar when not for a bodyguard firm. Policewoman Ho-ming and her inspector girlfriend have a fight in said bar one night. It leads to Tyler and Ho-ming meeting, drinking a lot in bars at one end of the street and throwing up on traffic at the other end.
Waking up the next morning in his apartment in bed together is especially bad news, especially since she has a gun. Fortunately Tyler has the sense to get his pants back on before she then wakes up and threatens to shoot him.  Did they or didn't they is the big question and it is answered in short order when the next scene is captioned ""9 months later"".
So, what does this first 6 minutes actually have to do with the rest of the film? Not as much as you'd think despite this being the beginning. The film is not so much about Tyler but his friend Jack (Wu Bai, a Taiwanese musician in real life). He works for a butcher and is married to Jennifer, daughter of a Hong Kong mobster Mr. Hong. He doesn't think much of Jack.
Tyler's firm is given the job of protecting Mr. Hong but things get complicated. Some old friends of Jack's turn up from Brazil and ask him to kill someone. In his past life (unknown to everyone else), Jack was part of this team of mercenaries called The Angels. They kill people for a living and ably demonstrated this while in Brazil, just before coming to Hong Kong. Unfortunately for Jack, the target turns out to be his father-in-law. Jack registers his opinion of this idea later by killing his former boss instead and stealing a lot of money from his former compatriots in a daring hit and following escape.
The last 45 minutes of the film are some of the best non-stop action you'll ever see as the Angels attempt to ambush Jack at his apartment. Combat spills over to a pitched battle at Kowloon Station and a nearby stadium hosting a rock concert. Two of the main protagonists fight to the death with guns, grenades, fists and feet above the unsuspecting audience while Tyler tries to deliver Jennifer's baby in the basement and avoid being killed at the same time.
You have to feel sorry for Tyler, he blunders into things a lot. He tries to do the right thing for Ho-ming and puts money under her door. She wants him to get lost and her dog eats the money. Her girlfriend puts a dent in his skull.  He tries to do his job. He foils the first attempted hit on Mr. Hong (not by the Angels) and narrowly avoids being shot in a fight with the assassin. All he gets in return is hit for leaving his post and threatened with being fired because no-one saw the fight and the assassin escaped. Clearly out of his league, it's a continuing source of amazement that he isn't killed. Later Tyler temporarily foils Jack's escape (then Jack is forced to beat him up to get away). This gets Tyler accused of being in league with him for stealing the money and being locked in the back of a truck until he confesses to being in on it. This is all (bad) news for him and its getting worse all the time.
Seeing him then break into Jack's apartment with a sledgehammer in search the stolen money, unaware that it is staked out by a number of heavily armed mercenaries is funny. Watching him burst through doors with a fake gun while a heavily armed man hiding inside and snipers outside decide whether or not to kill him is quite hilarious. Tyler goes on leading a charmed life as people step in front of bullets meant for him and narrowly avoids being blown up thanks to everyday kitchen appliances.
The acrobatics are amazing and just within the realm of the possible. The fight in Jack's apartment block is a particular highlight. Human agility is pushed to the limit. The combatants fight, run and scramble from building to building on ropes with no visible break from one motion to the next. Each jump,leap, punch and kick flows without a break from one to the next (but not like Crouching Tiger either - different but equal). Things are enhanced by innovative use of ""Point of thrown object views"" and ""Frozen rotational explosion perspective"" (you'll have to see what I mean) which add to the experience (and no, they're not ripping off The Matrix, which borrowed heavily from Hong Kong cinema in the first place). Even Tyler who spends a lot of time being swatted like a fly has a lot of agility and athleticism, it's just that the numerous people trying to kill him have the edge on him with that score.
Tyler settles differences with Ho-ming, Jennifer delivers safely, Jack achieves redemption, the guilty are smited and Tsui Hark receives atonement for Double Team and Knock Off.
This film was reviewed in Time magazine (at least the Asia-Pacific region) quite favorably and got a cinema/DVD/video release in Australia.
Don't think about why Jack's friends didn't kill Mr. Hong themselves. Also they actually speak Portuguese more than Spanish in Brazil (Some scenes are in English and Spanish as well as Cantonese) . Just suspend disbelief, things just ""are"" in this film.
The acting is very good (musicians or not, they do a very good job and I think one of them contributed to the excellent music in this film). This film is close to perfect for an action film and surpassing anything done in the US. I strongly recommend you see this film. Buy it if there's no other way to find it.
Hopefully not being remade in the US anytime soon, preferably not at all.",1025395200,,5508,4.501498501498501
1622693,5,B00005LKI9,"This movie has a script, but you will have to watch it twice before understanding why things happened. The camera work is awesome as well as the stunts and gunfights. ... I'll rather watch this over any ""hollywood"" action movie.",1022112000,2,228,4.725
1622694,4,B00005LKI9,"Tsui Hark, once a genius( still is...in some ways)were always a step ahead of the HK directors..( like when everyone were making Wuxia with high flying and special effects, he came with 'Blade')
This movie is like taking a rollercoaster ride when you're drunk and high and SICK at same time. Our main character, Tyler( pretty boy, Nicholas Tse) is a bartender and meets this one les cop one night. i duno what happened but they sleep together. and when he finds out she has his child, he starts to work for some Bodyguard company to make money...
and there's the guy with long hair...( forgot his name, sorry). Whom, Tyler helps by accident and becomes friend...and he is an ex special force....
some creative stuff but some scenes were not clear and dragging. but , Time and Tide still shows that Tsui Hark has genius ideas.....check out Legend of Zu...but with caution",1020038400,,870,4.69281045751634
1622695,5,B00005LKI9,"If they ever have a competition for the god of Asian cinema, obvious nominations would be John Woo (""The Killer"", ""Hardboiled"", ""A Better Tomorrow I & II""), Chow Yun Fat (the same) and the director of ""Time and Tide"", Tsui Hark. Hark was a producer on ""The Killer"", my all-time favorite movie. If I am correct, he was also a producer for ""A Better Tomorrow."" Plus, he directed ""Once Upon a Time in China."" If those aren't credentials for god of Asian cinema, what do you have to do?
 ""Time and Tide"", there is no American equivalent. It is over-the-top, nothing but action masterpiece. Even though there's nothing but action, there are some incredible dramatic moments. One of my favorite scenes is them riding along in the car singing to the Chinese song. It's almost as great as ""Tiny Dancer"" in ""Almost Famous."" If you love any kind of action, this is it.",1018828800,,858,4.607843137254902
1622696,5,B00005LKI9,"Tsui Hark's first Hong Kong movie after a disastrous attempt at moving to Hollywood was a brave movie.  He had to let people know he was back, and still at the cutting edge of action cinema.  TIME AND TIDE is a movie that confuses a lot of audiences, due to the unconventional editing approach Tsui took.  In a similar way to Wong Kar Wai, the editing removes most of the 'standard' scenes that drive plots forward, and leaves the incidental details - the looks, the expressions, the visual mood.  You have to dig deep to follow what happens, but claims that the movie has no plot are naive.  It's a decidedly cerebral action movie, a rare beast.
But it is an action movie first and foremost, and Tsui Hark presents here some of the most excitingly filmed action scenes ever.  The choreography, cinematography, editing and soundtrack all come together brilliantly, and the result is dazzling.
Highly recommended!",1015718400,2,912,4.777070063694268
1622697,4,B00005LKI9,"If you like Hong Kong actions flicks, this is a pretty good one.  This is a movie and not a documentary.  So enjoy it as such.  The movie is a bit more straight forward than appears.
The characters, themselves, are a bit unusual so your brain figures there must be some other subplot, which there really isn't. Also, there are two women in the movie that look similar and you can get confused.  When you get them confused, you think something else is happening again.  But that's OK.
The confusion and misdirection add to the enjoyment of the film.  It gives it a cinema verite feel.  I really, really like it!",1015113600,,610,4.441441441441442
1622698,2,B00005LKI9,"Time and tide may wait for no man, but Tsui Hark's film certainly doesn't, jettisoning coherence and character in its Leone-lunge to the finish.  'Time and Tide' follows the wearisomely familiar 'North By Northwest' action formula - a cocky, irresponsible and selfish man emotionally matures and learns to think about others, to the point of risking his life.  Just in case we miss the point, there are TWO pregnant women in the film - his struggles to develop feelings, mirror the 'difficulties' in giving birth; the babies are a signal of rebirth for men who are willing to ditch their old (macho) lives and start again.
The hero is a 21-year-old barman who picks up a hostile undercover cop, whose girlfriend has just ditched her.  After a drunken one-night-stand, he joins a dodgy security firm to raise enough money to escape to South America to 'forget' her, or, later, when he discovers she's pregnant, for alimony.  Meanwhile, in South America (and I found this part especially difficult to follow), a drug deal and jailbreak have consequences which spill out into Hong Kong.  At a job protecting some industrial magnate, the bodyguards learn that an assassination will be attempted.  The magnate's outcast, pregnant daughter, who married beneath her, is there with her husband, an abbattoir employee who unexpectedly connects the two plots.
Hark's best films ('Peking Opera Blues', 'Once Upon A Time In China') are such fun because the action pyrotechnics are rooted in characters we come to care about.  In this film, however, action takes precedence, and characters are left to fend for themselves, which they find more difficult than dodging endless bullets.  Even this wouldn't matter if the action was up to Hark's usual spectacular standard.  But rather than dance, the set-pieces stutter, the irritatingly 'frenetic' camerawork and jittery editing destroy all momentum.  The confusion as to what is going on in any given set-piece leaves the viewer disengaged.  The 'choreography' of movement is disappointingly graceless, under-imagined, even perfunctory. The locations, so evocative and central to Hark's major works, are merely functional backdrops.  The whole thing goes on far too long, and the sentimental subplot attempting to re-orient the lesbian is tasteless.",1014940800,2,2285,5.264462809917355
1622699,3,B00005LKI9,"when 'the matrix' came out north america was exposed to what asian audiences had seen for years.  the next step was to put american dollars behind an asian action picture, the result being 'crouching tiger hidden dragon'.  i must admit i thought that innovations in action films were going to plateau after this but anyone who has seen ""time and tide"" knows that's the furthest thing from the truth.  what really sets this film apart is not the stunts (although the stunts make the matrix look like steel magnolias) but tsui hark's camera work.  dramatic and innovative are both massive understatements.  the camera flies around more than the actors do.  the plot in this movie is extremely hard to follow but you won't care.  this movie was so visually impressive i had to rewind it several times because a shot or stunt blew me away.  a must see.",1013904000,,848,4.6824324324324325
1622700,5,B00005LKI9,"Tsui Hark is without question the most creative director/producer ever to come out of Hong Kong. There are others who may offer more ""art"" or more interesting character studies, or even more hyperkinetic action, but Tsui Hark just keeps on coming up with new ways of depicting action, and ""Time and Tide"" definitely continues the tradition. Unlike many of his other works, though, this film actually has a really good (and coherent!) storyline.
""Time and Tide"" shows that Tsui Hark is capable of being serious about his characters without compromising the slick visuals that are his trademark. The main character is far more introspective than usual for such a serious action film, and Tsui uses fast cuts, split screens, and other visually interesting techniques to depict the more prosaic scenes just as effectively as he uses them in the action scenes.
This is one of those rare films that worked for me both as a hardcore action film and as a story about interesting people. It definitely goes on my list right next to ""La Femme Nikita"", ""The Professional"" and ""The Killer"".",1005868800,3,1078,4.928571428571429

The plot, like any good HK thriller, is only there to service the action, and, boy howdy, there's plenty.  Hand-to-hand fights, chases through Kowloon's labyrinthine slums, backwards car chases, and gun fights in places that won't exactly spoil it if I tell you but you'll just have to rent it anyway.  Yes, the dubbing and subbing is odd; things in English that may sound cool to someone speaking Cantonese will make no sense to any of the English-native speakers.  I'm sure the Spanish is just as munged up.  But you know what?  Who cares?  You see these flicks to get blown away, not to contemplate the existential crises.  Rent and watch.

1622703,3,B00005LKI9,"Okay lets start by taking the other reviews with a grain of salt. Im always a little suspicious when I pick up a HK flick. Its like with Forrest Gumps box of chocolades. ""You never know what you're gonna get"". Anyways, the reviews below told me to buy the movie. So I did and this is my feelings about it.
I'll recapture the film for you quickly. Boy meets girl in bar. They get drunk. Have sex - or do they?. Girl gets pregnant - with boy?. Boy wants to help. Girl doesn't want help. Boy has no money. Boy joins uncle's bodyguard firm to get money for girl.
Okay lets forget the first 25 minutes of this movie. The girl has no place in this movie. Some might argue with me, but besides acting as a simple love interest. I can only see the parallel to the pregnant wife of the boys friend. Aha - read on..
In comes the boys ""friend"". Well on the cover they are called friends, but in my eyes...well then they are just to guys meeting up and trying to obtain the same goal.
Okay in comes the bad guys. Spanish speaking psychos. Apparently our friend has a problem with them and the boy gets caught in the middle because his uncle's firm is watching out for the psycho's leader. (Friend shoots the leader in the head and boy becomes a suspect because he knows ""friend"")
With all this slow building storytelling over. (Okay with some small time action from time to time) This is the place where the film kicks in and where I thought I had just wasted [money] on a HK flick. But in the last hour of the film, you comepletly forget about the [terrible] story and a simply taking by the incredible action stuff that Tsui Hark comes up with.
So folks the story [is terrible] big time, but the action in the end are so COOL. And let me just point out that I don't need action all the time, but what I do need is a good story.
I really wanted to give this movie 5 stars. Actually everytime I watch a movie a hope I can give it 5 stars, but in this case I can only give 3. The action is worth the 3 stars alone. The story none.
Why is this stupid bodyguard boy running around protecting people with a platic gun thoughout the whole movie - even though people are shooting at him? ...

On one side you have the Tyler (Nicholas Tse) who has just gotten a lesbian cop pregnant and is trying to escape Hong Kong for a South American beach. On the other side is Juan (Wu Bai), an ex-mercenary who has left South America and trying to settle down with his pregnant wife. Tyler is torn as he wants to get away but wants to do the responsible thing and support his child and its mother. He gets a job as a bodyguard which he slips his wages to support his unborn child.  On one of Tyler's bodyguard assignments he is placed in charge of protecting Juan's father-in-law. Juan's assistance on the assignment quickly develop a friendship between Tyler and himself. Juan's ex-mercenary group has made its way to Hong Kong and offer him forgiveness for his leaving if he kills his father-in-law. Juan assassinates the leader of the mercenary group instead. As his former colleagues close in and his wife gets closer to delivering the baby, Juan must hold off his new enemies and save his family.
This DVD offers the movie in Mandarin, Cantonese and English and the option of subtitles is also included.  The dubbing is not exceptional but is not distracting (far worse has been produced in other movies).
Every year Hollywood mass-produces action movies but this is a rare gem in the mainstream pile of sewage. T&T offers amazing cinematography while creating high-octane action scenes which are carefully choreographed. It is refreshing to see a movie which uses action scenes to further the plot then for the sake of appealing to teen males. I do not especially enjoy action movies and find that the new ones released each year are tedious and do not have anything new to offer but T&T defies these odds and excels far beyond in its originality.
The extras on the DVD are minimal but do not hinder the power of this DVD.
It is disappointing that more people have not seen or even heard of this movie. It deserves all the critical acclaim that it has received and more.

1622705,4,B00005LKI9,"This is a good action movie for those who like HK action flicks, and for those who are brand new to it. You can read the other reviews for the plot, it's the action your looking for and there is plenty of it! Wu Bai as Juan, the ex-mercenary, is awesome. I became a Nicolas Tse fan after Gen-X Cops, but Wu Bai steals this movie. The cat and mouse sequence in the apartment building between Juan and his former partners has to be the highlight of the movie. There are flaws in this movie, but they mostly have to do with the plot sequencing. You have to watch this movie a second time to figure out who everyone is. You also question why Nicolas Tse's character, Trey, continues to run around with a fake gun through two-thirds of the movie. What's he going to do, throw it at the bad guys? My only other disappointment was that there was no added extras to the DVD. A behind the scenes documentary would have been a nice touch. Overall a good action movie.",999648000,2,957,4.263736263736264

bought the DVD when I remembered it recently. I still like it!",1271894400,,121,3.6923076923076925
7944011,5,B00005LKI9,"This is one of those movies I absolutely love. . .but I'm not entirely sure why.  I seem to find myself watching it over and over.  When I was in film school we would all get together and watch it, like moths to a flame.  Even the most artistic films snobs would sit silently in awe of this movie.  But I'll try and recall as much as I can.

First, from a technical standpoint, this film is brilliant.  Tsui redefines handheld camerawork in this film.  It's not the typical ""shaky"" cam.  It's like a hyper dolly move.  Plus, you have to give mad props to any movie where the camera man jumps out the window and rappels down the side of a building after the actor. . .and holds the shot!! (if you missed it, check the apartment shootout when Wu Bai runs and jumps out the window and ropes down the side-that ain't no crane or jib arm, folks)  The visual style adds a lot to the overall feeling of the movie.

Second, the movie just drips with cool.  But it's not a forced cool.  It's just done in such a way that even the simplest actions seem graceful.  Effortless.

Third, Anthony Wong and Nicholas Tse are great.  Wu Bai brings his brooding rock star thing to the screen quite nicely, as well.  But Tsui has never had a problem getting solid performances out of any of the people he's worked with  (I don't care what anyone says, I love Knock Off and I'll fight to the death to defend it as a great film).  The interplay and banter between characters is cool.  Nobody gets overly chatty, but it's enough.

Fourth, the action, while not as plentiful as other films in the genre, is solid.  Even in his worst films, Tsui knows how to put action to celluloid.  He can do it in his sleep.  This movie is no exception.  People rappelling down the side of an apartment building having a machine gun battle?  What?  Are you serious?  Yeah, he's the man.

I know people take umbrage with the plot.  Yeah, the crazy guy and the cockroaches and all the meandering can seem a little weird.  But, like me, just watch it 40+ times and it'll all make perfect sense.  Seriously, though, watch it a few times and you'll get it.  It gets better every time.

Most people wouldn't enjoy this film.  In fact, this is really not a mainstream film in any way.  Film people can appreciate the technical specs, and then there are just a select few who will always find themselves mesmerized by it for no apparent reason.  But those looking for another Hard Boiled will be quite disappointed.  All I can recommend is to try it.  You'll either love it or wish you hadn't seen it.  But for those of you that do love it, you'll keep coming back to it, time and time again.  It will call to you while you sleep, eat, work, even when you're making the sweet lovings.  In fact, I think I'm going to pop it in right now.  You've been warned.",1217203200,,2811,4.304597701149425
7944012,5,B00005LKI9,I love the action in this chinese action movie. The picture looks good too. Tyler has had trouble all his life he has always dreamed of living in South America.,1128643200,,160,4.366666666666666
7944013,5,B00005LKI9,"Im making this short the action in this movie is amazing.

The characters can get confusing if u are not paying attention. Infact theres almost no need to pay attention to the drama parts of the plot since its pointless in this film

What sets this movie above all the rest in action is the way the people move. run shoot, jump, slide, shoot, jump out a 10 story window, rappel, shoot, then flip all in about 10 seconds.

Its just so amazing watching these gunmen perform. If u like action get this for sure.",1121990400,4,508,4.326315789473684
7944014,5,B00005LKI9,"I had to watch this twice to follow the plot, but it is an amazing film. Most directors put in some one new thing in a film (the amazing car chasing an el train in The French Connection, the first going the wrong way on a freeway chase in To Live and Die in LA, and so on), but Tsui Hark puts in some half a dozen new things in this one film instead of parceling them out over several films. A really great film.",1072483200,3,412,3.8588235294117648

How the mightly have fallen...
NOT RECOMMENDED. Classic run-of-the-mill drama-action junk. Forgettable in every way possible.
If you like Tsui, check him out in ""Police Assassins/Yes Madam"".",1059696000,2,409,5.029411764705882
