2033972,5,B0001WTVA2,"This award-winning, made for television drama was based on a true story and follows the love affair of Rose Parks (Kelly McGillis), a divorced woman, and Robby Smith (Treat Williams), a developmentally disabled man. The pair's relationship begins as a friendship, but soon grows into something deeper and causes concern for Robby's family. The tension reaches a climax when Rose and Robby declare their intention to marry, and the family firmly oppose any such plan. This sensitive portrayal of both the romantic relationship and the family relationship provides a solid family drama that speaks to the true nature of love.
I remember this movie being on TV ages ago. I was so mad when I didn't put a tape in my VCR to record it.  I was suprised when I found out this movie was to be released on DVD. I cannot wait to watch it again after 12 years.
I am so glad that they are finally releasing some of those made for tv movies on DVD. It's about time!!",1083715200,9,952,4.567251461988304

2034025,4,B0001WTVA2,"This is a drama/love story with a charming and heart-warming ending.  Family friendly.  May or may not be based on a true story; there are some conflicting reports out there on that fact.  However, the movie is well acted and has an A-list cast.  Worth watching.  The moving is older (released around 1993 or so) but doesn't ""feel"" dated when you're watching it.",1440979200,,362,4.682539682539683

Seeing it again, though we think this version is a remake of the one we saw in the 1980s (significant life events occurred near this tike frame), added a whole new dimension to our marriage.",1440633600,,344,4.196969696969697

2034043,5,B0001WTVA2,"One of the best feel-good movies you'll ever see, and with a happy ending. I watched it twice on Amazon Prime, decided it's a keeper which I'll probably watch 2-3 times a year, so I ordered the DVD. Treat Williams and Kelly McGillis are wonderful in this fine film.",1406851200,,265,4.428571428571429
2034044,5,B0001WTVA2,"A very gripping tale about just being a little different.  I found this to be a true love story.  With every emotional roll-a-coaster ride and bump along the way, the heart is what it is and wants what it wants.  Deep thought and an open mind drive this emotional bus we call quality of life",1406332800,,291,4.254545454545455

2034050,3,B0001WTVA2,"Joel Rice, who describes himself as a ""social worker/producer"" is credited for several interesting films that rub against problems of people having learning difficulties, and in this item made for television, reportedly based upon actual events, the theme is decidedly unusual, a romantic affair absorbing a man with such difficulties and a woman without.  Robbie Smith (Treat Williams) is scorned and carelessly harassed by people in his Kansas home town but is loved by his parents with whom he lives, and by his brother.  Despite his mental slowness, Robbie has been accepted as merely a local oddity, a status that is capsized when Rose Parks (Kelly McGillis), a divorcee with a sordid past meets him, their comfortable beginning friendship turning into something stronger as the censure of those about them serves to refill their shared desire to be together.  The relationship between evidently mismatched lovers is not effectively developed, little but melodrama filling the scenario, a notable scripting weakness being Robbie's plainly non-discriminatory feelings of affection to others while simultaneously being romantically obsessed with Rose, but a strong element of the film is its emphasis upon the struggles of those involved in their dealings with a non-compassionate officialdom.  There are no true villains in this piece shot in Ontario with acts of reconcilement amid the principals lacking conviction, as does Williams in general although he works very hard at creating his part, with McGillis earning acting honours for her full-blooded performance as a woman seeking another chance, while other capable turns in an intriguingly cast production come from Steve Railsback as Robbie's protective older brother, Gordon Pinsent playing Rose's father, and Colin Fox as a judgemental doctor who instigates the primary set of problems for the lovelorn pair.",1121731200,4,1871,5.486111111111111
