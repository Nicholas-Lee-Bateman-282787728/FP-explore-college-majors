5793550,1,B00DDTRUXK,"poor acting from the main character and lousy direction makes very unrealistic the action sequences.
Also very submissive husband and rebel daughters become annoying  to watch.",1384387200,,176,5.769230769230769
5793551,3,B00DDTRUXK,"For all the clips they show of Irene practicing Judo, she is forever getting thrown down, knocked over the head, caught without her gun, and allowing people to sneak up on her. Oh where did that bad man go? Too late, he appeared out of nowhere to kick the gun out of my hand. The show has a good cast but the writing consistently leaves them looking like knuckleheads.",1378512000,,368,4.3478260869565215
5793552,4,B00DDTRUXK,This is one of the very good Nordic crime dramas. Good stories and characters. A nice mix of work and family within the stories.,1377561600,2,128,4.375
8592332,5,B00DDTRUXK,"I am always on the lookout for a police/procedural/mystery series, and if it is found in Europe, all the better. I came across the 'Irene Huss' series by chance, and it is a winner!

Taken from the writings of Helene Tursten, this crime thriller series lends its way to film very well. Set in Gotenberg, Sweden, gritty seaside port city, the crimes are varied and some quite unusual. The star of this series is Angela Kovacs, who plays Irene Huss. A more natural actor you will not find. She lends herself to the simplicity of intelligent thought and careful mastery of detective work. She is a wife, mother of twin daughters, and a full time detective. From the get go, we can tell she is the go to detective of her department. The others are all intelligent, but have some sort of personality quirk. Irene is quick to pick up clues, quick to win trust of the victims and quick to go off on her own into unsettled and violent areas. However, with her quick wit and physical acuity she is able to sidestep most of the problems she runs into. We are privy to her family life with her chef husband and teenage daughters. Irene is a real person, a real woman with wants, desires and the ability to manipulate her environment. Angela Kovacs is this series, and it is apparent to everyone.

I have not read any of Helene Tursten's books, but I will be on the lookout for them. This is a series of an intelligent and attractive woman, and often that is an enigma.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-12-17",1489276800,,1495,4.488970588235294

8592338,5,B00DDTRUXK,"This series is probably the best of its genre. Interestingly, the spoken Swedish with English subtitles is not much of a distraction. The writing for the subtitles is so good that the characters' personalities come through very well. Highly recommended.",1416873600,2,253,5.35
8592339,4,B00DDTRUXK,"A little less intrigue than other Nordic noir offerings,but doesn't disappoint.",1409788800,,79,6.2727272727272725
8592340,3,B00DDTRUXK,"The series is very interesting, though not of the same complexity as Varg Veum or the Wallander series.  After watching the first 3 episodes (or films - as each is a separate 90 minute film); I did go ahead and purchase the entire series.  Whether the series is worth the price or not is still a question.  What is not a question is the absolute cheap packaging that MHz arranges for the DVDs - again, there is only one spindle and all three DVDs are piled on one spindle.  I don't think they could have made the packaging any cheaper unless they used cardboard.  It's disappointing at any price, but for the relative high price of this set, it's an insult to the consumer.",1396224000,2,673,4.395161290322581
8592341,5,B00DDTRUXK,An excellent police detective show. American TV should have shows like this instead of all these sci-fi police shows. Too bad it is not in English but I had no problem reading the translation.,1386374400,,192,4.676470588235294
