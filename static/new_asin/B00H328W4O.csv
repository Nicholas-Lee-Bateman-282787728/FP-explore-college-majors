8629374,5,B00H328W4O,"I bought the Yoga DVD for my wife and decided to workout with her. Now, I've never done Yoga before, so I had no idea what to expect. I'm glad I tried it. The routines in the All-Round Vinyasa Yoga work on balance, flexibility and strength. You definitely feel relaxed, but also feel like you got a workout. The instructor is great. Amanda has a calm conversational tone and explains all the routines so that even beginners can follow along.

I didn't try either of the leg workouts, just the All-Round Yoga. This DVD has 3 workouts. My wife told me she also liked the leg workouts. She said they really focus on stretching and strengthening the legs and hips.",1389744000,,660,4.5
