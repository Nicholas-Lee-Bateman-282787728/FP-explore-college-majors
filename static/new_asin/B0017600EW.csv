3167559,4,B0017600EW,"I found this documentary quite well made and entertaining, and a lot more thought provoking than I expected. The interviewees include everyone from the Fonz to Princess Leia to Doctor Drew to Andrew Dice Clay to Bill Maher to Andy Kindler to Craig Feguson. And all of the above have interesting opinions on the subject of hecklers.

It was a bit of a stretch comparing film criticism to heckling, and the only way Kennedy could make the point work was by ignoring film criticism that celebrates good filmmaking.  There's still plenty of that around, and presumably Kennedy is well aware of this, as he's been associated with a number of films that have gotten good reviews.  Also, his point about critics giving snider reviews than necessary is a valid one, but it's nothing new.  Bosley Crowther and Paul Kael were capable of eviscerating crap way back when.",1223856000,2,859,4.8231292517006805
3167560,5,B0017600EW,"From the reviews I've read so far, it's pretty apparent that the negative ones are obviously from Jamie Kennedy ""haters"" which doesn't surprise me because that's what I expect from these repetitive folks who just keep bashing Jamie Kennedy for the same reasons over and over again, and sadly alot of them actually get paid for their reviews...whatever...
As for the thumbs up reviews, I'm with them...I give credit to Jamie Kennedy along with the other comedians who contributed to this film for taking a stand against hecklers and shedding a different light on a subject that really is often overlooked. I loved all of the different commentaries from all of the different performers ranging from Carrot Top to Louie Anderson to Roseann Barr..this is a film definately worth watching especially if you love watching comedy...it will make you think twice before heckling an onstage comedian ever...definately CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT...it is very entertaining..",1222214400,4,956,5.214285714285714
3167561,4,B0017600EW,"I liked this documentary.  There were a number of really great ideas touched here, but there were problems with it as well.

First the good.

This is a topic that is not talked about too much yet to me is very fascinating. I really enjoy looking behind the scenes of the standup comic world.

The documentary in a blunt way gave the critics a little bit of ""the golden rule"".

There were numerous interviews with comedians that I really admire who said some very interesting and insightful comments, such as Lewis Black, David Cross, Dave Atell, and Patton Oswalt to name a few.

There were psychologists and other professionals interviewed who also made interesting points.

The bad..

This documentary did not really make its points clearly and concisely.  There were many good ideas touched on, but not investigated as they should have been. Such as the egos in both performers and in critics.  If Mr. Kennedy is sad about being Heckled than maybe he should consider another field of work, obviously his ego is really tied into showbiz and showbiz is not for the thin skinned.

Yet, much of the heckling and criticism is very mean spirited, cruel and self-serving. Heckling is just rude.  There is usually just a drunk person who wants attention or has a personality disorder.

Criticism, in my opinion, should explain why one does not like something.  Though critics are often correct in their assessments, it is not fair just to say that one does not like something, then get mean spirited about it. If one is not able to give a good reason for not liking something, then one should not be a critic.  A critic has to know what makes things good or bad, not just be intuitive about it and being mean spirited seems to be the replacement for that knowledge and it is self-serving to the critic only and does nothing to change or improve the entertainer.

There were also some of the interviews which were pointless and did not add to the documentary or were redundant or tangential.",1221696000,4,1985,4.677233429394812
3167562,1,B0017600EW,"Ok, my bias is upfront. I have had the displeasure of watching multiple movies 'starring' Jamie Kennedy and all are the same. He plays a white man who thinks he's black who is either mentally retarded or is 'young in his mind' (not naive, but stupid). Each movie he makes is faced is a barrage of bad reviews (because they are bad) and this is his triumphant battle call....

Of ""shut up!"".

The gull Kennedy has is amazing. He compares critics with hecklers as if they are the same. Hecklers halt performances whereas critics write about an item AFTER the performance is done. Not only that, he seems to think that critics have nothing good to say. The fact of the matter is that the general public has a set amount of funds and have to decide whether or not to see a movie. One good place to find info is rottentomatoes or other sites with multiple reviews, highlighting the good and bad opinions. Jamie is just pissed that his page holds a miserable rating because he makes miserable movies. Rather than learn from the critics, like many wiser comedians (I can't morally call Jamie a comedian though) and many film makers. The last scene shows it all. Rather than take constructive criticism, Jamie lights his reviews on fire and dances like a moron around them.

What's even more horrible is that the heckler in Jamie's audience is FUNNIER than Jamie is. Here, right in the trailer with no shame...
Heckler - ""Why don't you make like a Kennedy and drop dead!""
Kennedy - ""You know the difference between you and me? I came here in a limo.""

How is that funny, Jamie? How did that put him in his place? But this is coming from an untalented, unfunny, liar. (On his personal youtube he claims he punk'd Penn and Teller on their own show by providing a short clip. If one is to watch the whole episode Penn clearly calls Kennedy and his pal out as performance artists....but hey, if you fail constantly I guess you need to create a mystical word of fantasy to think you matter)

Great Job, Kennedy. Since I was so mean to you in this review allow me to make it up to you by writing some words you'll never see albeit in this review...

""And the Oscar goes to Jamie Kennedy""",1221523200,5,2173,4.447236180904523
3167563,3,B0017600EW,"This movie isn't so much about hecklers as it is about Critics. All of the funny comedians are reduced to very brief clips, and don't nearly distract from the obvious focus of this dacumentary: Jamie Kennedy's inability to accept the fact that his body of work is the subject of criticism.
  To be fair, Mr Kennedy wanting to confront internet debasers who mearly sling hurtful and often violent insults is admirable enough. After a while though it becomes evident that Jamie has some serious personal issues, and his valid hurt gives way to a full on pity party. With the likes of none other than Carrot Top commiserating with Jamie Kennedy about how negative reviews have hurts their feelings beyond repair.
  This movie really lost me though when it championed Ewe Bolle's ""put up or shut up"" campaign against his critics. It shows highlights of the boxing matches, playing triumphant music while Bolle pummels those who dare speak ill of the likes of House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark. As a movie watcher I cannot suspend disbelief to the point where I root for Ewe Bolle. People can fly, be named Hellboy, the dork gets the girl, but Ewe Bolle is not a due any amount of sympathy.
  In the end, I did take some of this to heart. The internet does make it easy to namelessly efface the work of others ( hell, I'm doing it right now ) and it's important that reviews be informative and not simply an opportunity to make yourself look smart by trashing someone else. Was it Jamie Kennedy'd fault his movies weren't very good? No, and his e-critics would have done well to point the finger at the individuals higher up the chain. It is, however, important to remember than Jammie Kennedy was paid more than several years worth of most peoples salaries to make his movies, and the public has only limited funds/time to spend on entertainment. That is where the critic comes in.",1220832000,6,1883,4.605970149253731

To be frank about this, it was a complete let down and failed to get to any true point about heckling other than it's annoying or done by someone seeking attention due to being drunk or some other reason.  Then the long drawn out discussion of critics which had nothing to do with the act of heckling other than it too offends the performers.

Artists can be a bit thin skinned about the art they present, but this was just pointless.  The only part I got a chuckle at was Dice calling out CNN for not fact checking their information before doing an interview, something that seems to be a trend.",1503273600,2,697,4.421875

3167571,4,B0017600EW,"Nice documentary. Enjoyed watching. Gets into critics more than hecklers though. But I guess the point is to explore criticism of performers who are in front of others. Didn't agree completely with the premise. You know Uncle Joe can be hilarious in the fishing boat, but isn't a performer. A performer is looking to profit from their performance. Sure they want to be accepted but you can't please everyone. I think though that the point was that criticism can go too far, and there are some cringey, extreme, and funny incidents recalled in this documentary.",1465862400,,560,4.905263157894737
3167572,4,B0017600EW,"This is a very low budget Australian movie that if it didn't have sex scenes and a few things like that, would resemble many Australian kids TV shows over the years with its look.  Basically a man named Mike approaches Steve a comedian coming off a performance at a club for his phone number, as he wants his help in becoming famous.  He is invited to a workshop comedian group but cant understand why telling jokes hes found on the Internet isn't acceptable and feels humiliated by Steve and the students.  He then decides to yell out the punchlines to Steves act the next night which Steve poorly handles by humiliating him.  They have an altercation in the toilets after which leaves Mike dead.  However Mike isn't gone, his face and voice taunts Steves next performance, and when his agent sends him to visit Dr Seinfeld, or hell be pulling him from a nationally televised gig, he receives a help CD to listen to in his sleep.  The next day Steve awakes outside of his body, he cant touch, communicate or move anything.  To make matters worse his body is walking around and his heckler is inside.

Its a fairly enjoyable movie.  I was expecting maybe a few more stand up lines from a variety of comedians but the movie more focuses on the girlfriend, ex wife and father parts of Steves life.  The ending was a bit of a letdown and I don't think one of the characters would go where they did.  By the way if you don't understand the Logies reference in the film, Logies are Australias equivalent of Emmy Awards. This also has a really cool creepily sung version of the theme song to Round the Twist playing in the background at one stage.  Hope they release a soundtrack so I can hear that again.",1462579200,,1699,4.4627831715210355

So I changed my attitude and started using my words instead of talking s*** because I'm sure it is hard to be original, it's hard to put everything together and make it entertaining, so I have this movie to thank for changing my way of thinking and talking about entertainment,; which is a passion of mine.

Just kidding Jamie Kennedy is F-ing funny!! And it is definitely worth the $3 amazon is charging for the movie.

This film can be used as a textbook regarding how to deal with difficult attention starved hecklers and critics, by some of the most famous and smartest comedians and artists in recent memory.

3167578,4,B0017600EW,"You know, it is so true that there are always two sides to every story. Rarely is anything ever absolute. I don't actually ever remember seeing any of Jamie's movies besides this doc. I do know of him though. I have to say I did enjoy this and had an appreciation for Jamie's point of view. With the advent of the internet, like myself, everyone has an opinion these days. All forms of art suffer from criticism however; art itself, music, movies, photography. There are message boards galore on ratings for a good plumber in your area, doctors, contractors and so on. If you're going to put yourself out there, in any form, there are going to be haters. It comes with the territory. We judge everyday without even being aware of it. In Jamie's defense there are some very harsh people out there. It's perfectly okay if you don't like someone or what they put out there as entertainment or art or whatever. It is just my opinion that there are too many people crossing into this extreme territory of hate and other forms of extreme criticism. It's one thing to say I didn't care for the movie because I didn't find it entertaining for whatever reason. It's another to verbally bash the person to no end because what they do isn't your flavor. To sit behind a computer and write such things, to me, is really weak.",1395014400,,1313,4.497907949790795
3167579,1,B0017600EW,"I thought this might be really entertaining since I saw 'Joe Rogan' as one of the top guys and have seen him hilariously destroy several hecklers. I kind of thought this was going to be the focus of the movie.

Instead it is all about Jaime Kennedy's insecurities. The guy can't handle bombing, which happens to all comedians. Instead, this turns into a whine fest. Wah! people don't like my act! Wah! Please, you are paid to entertain. Every comic will bomb at some point, he throws a tantrum about it like a spoiled child. Most of the ""documentary"" is spent courting Uwe Boll and Carrot Top as fellow bashed entertainers. It is pathetic. This could have been hilarious if they just played real comics tearing down hecklers, but it is all about Kennedy's ego and lack of ability to handle the abuse that is going to come to you if you choose this career path.",1389312000,5,860,4.512820512820513
3167580,1,B0017600EW,"I thought the movie would be up my alley.  I like comedy, and I appreciate the challenges of maintaining control of a room, and the genius required to spontaneously control a room.  Instead the movie is a general complaint by Jamie Kennedy (who didn't come off as funny) against everyone who doesn't like his material.  Umm...  You're a performer who people pay to see make fun of others...  You can't be so thick skinned when it turns on you.

The video briefly starts with hecklers, and then moves on to critics who didn't like his B movies.  (How can you be offended when people like the Mask better than a cut-rate sequel?)  It starts with a bunch of folks calling critics people who have never done anything relevant in their lives.  Then it moves on to accuse critics of trying to be performance artists on their own.  Umm...  For the same reason that comedians have to shock as entertainers, critics have to also...

One appeal of the movie was that it was short.  Even then I couldn't finish it.  It's not even worth watching on Netflix.  The time would have been better spent watching some real talent like Joe Rogan.",1386460800,2,1126,4.56
3167581,3,B0017600EW,"As an avid standup fan, I really enjoyed the commentary from people like Patton Oswalt, David Cross, Lewis Black, Paul F Tomkins, etc.  That alone made it worth it for me.  But halfway through, the movie just stops being about hecklers, and then tries to draw a parallel between hecklers and critics.  Apart from the fact that this just seems tangential and weirdly preachy for the duration of the film, the movie kind of undermines itself and fails to prove its own themes.  For one, the film's negative stance on critics is really poorly supported by the fact that they primarily interview comedians, who are some of the harshest and most outspoken critics of other artists and celebrities.  Patton Oswalt, for instance, has talked about Paris Hilton being eaten by wolves.  It's also unclear what we're supposed to take away from the movie.  Yes, some critics, like hecklers, are just selfish bullies, but does that mean that no one has the right to criticize anything or anyone because sometimes people get their feelings hurt?  Many critics, especially artists who criticize other artists, do so because they care about their art form.  Dave Grohl has ripped into Nickelback because he believes they're ruining music.  Sometimes criticism is mean for the sake of being mean, sometimes it's unsubstantiated or uninformed, sometimes it's used to bolster insecure egos, but other times it's constructive and even necessary.  Nevertheless, there's some really interesting, thought-provoking stuff in this documentary, whether you agree with the film or not.  And at the end of the day, it does serve as a reminder that whenever we criticize someone or someone's work, we are actually talking about another human being.",1379203200,,1719,5.1
3167582,5,B0017600EW,"I really loved this documentary and found it inspiring and motivating.  All those consider the source, critics vs doers,  creativity vs destruction, thoughts come to mind.  There is valid criticism that helps one grow, but there are also mean-spirited and thoughtless people.  People are motivated by different things.  There are lower and higher motivations.  Some people just want attention, some are jealous, some critics are creative and deeply dedicated. The internet certainly makes it easy for people to just say, you suck. They don't edit themselves 100 some times like a letter writer might. They don't ponder or do deep analysis.  Many just do character assassinations.

I once thoughtlessly wrote a lazy analysis of a poem which was written long ago, and had  imagery that simply turned me off.  I more or less said that the poem sucked.  The teacher let me know that I didn't even comprehend the poem.  He was right.  I had to read that stinkin' poem hundreds of times before I actually understood what the poet was saying (my problem, not his). I still don't like the poem or this particular poet because I don't like his style for many reasons.  But I liked what I came to understand he was saying, found it profound, and understood that I sucked on first analysis, not him.

There is much to be gained from thoughtfully disliking or liking something.  I got so much out of this documentary that has me still thinking on it.",1371859200,4,1438,4.784552845528455
3167583,5,B0017600EW,"This movie's premise is to indict hecklers and critics for standing in the way of art and expose them for the pathetic sad sacks that they are. The editing and production are slanted in a way that we are supposed to appreciate the likes of Jamie Kennedy and Uwe Boll as gifted people and all who oppose this point of view are irrational haters and failures as human beings with no valid points or criticisms. The finished product fails at this premise because everyone heckling Jamie Kennedy have, far and away, have the most entertaining lines.  They try to endict critics but yet they have the best diggs. It didn't help the cause when JK's opening comedian keeps laughing at everything these aleged haters had to say. They try to have some of the most undefensible people like Eli Roth and George Lucas to represent proud visionary entertainers. Then they feature some of the most hilarious hecklers soundly destroying some of the most dispicable comedians. All this comes off as satire to me. It feels ironic and silly like ""This is Spinal Tap"" but I know the makers of this documentary where going for a more serious tone.

To put it in another way; its like say you wanted to do a documentary about oppressive government trying to muffle free speach. In your mind, you are thinking about people like Nelson Mendela or Ghandi and you say,"" yes, I want you to tell that story"". Then the producers go out and film someone like Adolf Hitler from his pre ""Mine Kampf"" days. Yes, I am comparing Jamie Kennedy to Adolf Hilter, but only as an analogy to how damaging they are to the world and how big a douche bags they must be. I'm sure they only selected a hack like Jamie Kennedy because a hack like Dane Cook would have wanted too much money. If you need evidence of Jamie Kennedy being a douche, look up anything on youtube that involves him at E3. This dude seems like he is always drunk or doped up or something. The least he could do is comb his hair or actualy tell a funny joke. I cannot take this movie very seriuosly because they try to silence too many valid criticisms and portray some irreprehensible celebrities as martyrs. Go and watch that Jamie Kennedy E3 hosting footage on youtube and tell me if JK is the Jesus this movie makes him out to be.

Aside from the vile aforementioned, there are alot of appearances from other big names in comedy such as; Louis CK, Patton Oswalt, Louis Black speaking, Joe Rogan and many other actualy funny people talking about their own experiences with heckling. Then you have the sweet Henry Winkler talking about how hurtful criticisms can be. I think these people all thought they was in some different documentary. People like Andrew Dice Clay and Jamie Kennedy have no place speaking alongside real talented comedians like Dave Atel. This is why the premise of the movie falls apart and you begin to side with the demonized Hecklers. After watching this movie, I asked myself a question that the movie asked,""what kid wants to grow up and be a critic""? This guy, right here. This movie had the oppesed effect it set out to create. Now, I think I would actualy pay money to tell certain people off. This movie is actualy encouraging me to do mean things I had never contemplated.

Bottom line, movie was the hilarious. I completely enjoyed myself. This will easily be the most funny, if not only funny thing that is tied to Jamie Kennedy's name. I recommend you watch it today with a friend who has a sense of humor and knows good things from things that are whack, so you don't feel isolated or alone for having normal tendancies to look at people like Louie Anderson sideways.",1363564800,,3633,4.567484662576687

3167585,1,B0017600EW,"The blatant bait-and-switch that this film attempts to pull is just astounding. It starts off as supposedly a film about hecklers, and how public performers, mostly standup comedians, react to them as a phenomenon.

Then 25 minutes in, it complete veers off into talking not about hecklers, but about CRITICS. Director Michael Addis tries to justify this threadbare analogy by asking what the difference is between the two, and showing one or two interviewees who entertain this notion, like Craig Ferguson, who says that both are usually drunk and stupid, or author John Ridley, who compares the heckler's ""You suck"" to the critic's ""The performance wasn't that good.""

Um, no.

The former is obnoxious, and comes from someone who is not an articulate writer paid to present his or her views in a forum that people pay or click on to read of their own volition. Hecklers merely disrupt a performance that many others paid to see, and do nothing but annoy others. By contrast, when a critic writes reviews you do not agree with or dislike, you can choose not to read them. The mere existence of a review by a critic you dislike doesn't disrupt your ability to read other parts of the paper.

I could've enjoyed a good documentary examining the practice of entertainment criticism, but this should've been a separate film, one distinct from one about hecklers, and which could've led to a discussion of the distinction between which critics are articulate, polite and thoughtful in their analysis of whether a film set out to do what it intended to for its targeted audience. Instead of focusing on that from the outset, Addis engages in what is either the worst narrative con-job I've ever seen in a documentary, or the worst instance of a filmmaker's inability to decide upon a consistent subject for his film.  One clue to this is that during the outtakes that are shown during the closing credits, when a band called The Used is solicited for an interview, the film is described to them as ""a documentary about critics"". So why wasn't the movie simply called ""Critics""? Draw your own conclusion from this.

Even as a film about critics, there seems to be, in the ""critics suck"" portion of the film, a preponderance of those who merely whine about receiving bad reviews, even when those are reviews are restrained, if critical. Jamie Kennedy makes an fool of himself when he confronts one critic and argues, that he would've liked ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" more if he had better sex prior to watching it, or denigrating another as attending a Trekkie or Comic-Con nerd. Yeah, Jamie. YOU'RE the cool one. I guess in Kennedy's view, ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" is good as a question of fact, and therefore, anyone who disagrees must therefore, ipso facto, be operating from some ulterior motive or personal problem coloring their reaction to it. It's almost as if Kennedy feels entitled to not get bad reviews. Similarly, Rob Zombie characterizes critics who give bad reviews to Spielberg films as sexless losers living in their parents' basement. Sure, Rob. That's the reason critics said that ""Jurassic Park II"" wasn't that good. It's not because the film wasn't that good. No, it's because of the critics' problems. This is par for the course throughout the film, with everyone from to Perez Hilton to Uwe Boll jumping on the argumentum ad hominem bandwagon, completely failing to distinguish between gratuitous vitriol and dismissal of any and all legitimate criticism.  If there is any credence given to the idea that criticism is a valid form of writing, and that some critics are talented, insightful essayists who indeed serve the audiences who come to appreciate them as good gauges based on their simpatico tastes, it's almost completely absent from ""Heckler"". Some brief lip service paid to Roger Ebert as one exception, but it is used as a springboard to dismiss even  him by pointing out the poor quality of the one film whose screenplay he did write, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"". Criss Angel is shown saying that he listens to critics in order to improve his work, but the film abruptly cuts away from him before he can elaborate.

The film eventually broadens its scope to criticism of ANY TYPE, as when Eli Roth whines about focus groups, which he calls the death of cinema. He makes the point that those in focus groups should not necessarily be taken as accurate barometers of the national or global audience for a film, but then undercuts this argument (which could've set a respectable tone for the film, and provoked dialogue among the film's subjects and its viewers), by referring to a focus group attendee as a ""fat girl from Cleveland"" and a ""f***"". I'm not sure what's funnier, his hypocrisy in decrying polite criticism by moviegoers by criticizing them impolitely himself, or his referring to his work as ""cinema"".

Even criticism itself is thrown out the window as a unifying theme, when instances of Jewel, Jim Everett and Andrew Dice Clay being denigrated by obnoxious interviewers are included as relevant cases. So undiscriminating is Addis about what he is willing to throw into this chop suey of a film, that he even profiles actress Nicole Madich, who talks about being bullied as a teen for being small-breasted (which she proves to us by showing us her bare breasts), and Jody Vaclav, who talks about reaction to her being a transsexual. If Vaclav is an actress or comedian, I don't know, since the film only identifies her as ""transsexual"". What these two interviews have to do with critics, much less the film's title, is anyone's guess.

Yes, there are critics who are nothing more than obnoxious nihilists with who simply revel in negativity and are about as thoughtful and balanced in their assessments as Joseph Goebbels reincarnated as a rabid snake, like the utterly obnoxious blogger that Kennedy confronts while on G4'th ""The Live Feed"", but the film not only lacks balance, and a desire to ask its subjects what the criteria are for good reviews and bad ones, it lacks any cogent thesis. It simply either doesn't know what it wants to be about, or tries to fool the viewer into believing it's about one thing that's actually conflated with several other things, and beyond the first 25 minutes, just resembles a pityfest by Jamie Kennedy and other performers grumbling in indiscriminate fashion over anyone who doesn't provide them with uncritical adulation.",1352937600,23,6404,4.887661141804788
3167586,3,B0017600EW,"I watched this documentary over the weekend and it was just ok.  It starts out being pretty good.  It shows people heckling comedians and how the comedians react and then interviews them on their view point on hecklers. This part of the movie was really good and shows you how big of idiots people can be.

Then it takes a turn for the worse.  The rest of the movie is Jamie Kennedy confronting ""critics"" and demanding to know why they did not like what ever he did, be it stand up or a movie.  I understand Mr. Kennedy's feelings that sometimes these critics are not critiquing his film or work but him personally but he really must understand that that is what comes with the career he choose.

3167587,3,B0017600EW,"I really liked this at first. The film made me realize that comedians are people who put themselves out there with their creative work.  Being criticized by drunks trying to get attention is a form of bullying and it was refreshing to see so many artists talk about it.  There are some great interviews with some of my favorites: David Cross and Patton Oswalt, for example. However, I started to realize this documentary was centered around Kennedy being upset for the mostly terrible reviews he was getting for his movies.  Many of the reviews were done by non-critics and Kennedy spends time trying to figure out why they said they things they did. Personally, I'm not a fan of his stand up but I do think the message of the documentary is important and timely.",1351728000,,763,4.637037037037037

I was expecting something along the lines of this...however, I could only get through thirty minutes of it before I was simply fatigued and bored with whining.  The documentary overstates the obvious -- people on stage hate being heckled, have feelings, hate getting bad reviews, etc.  I understand that -- but the fact of the matter is that comedians, and for that matter, most people who have put themselves on the stage or in the public eye, should expect nothing else but be at the mercy of their crowd.  I feel as though it's part of the job description -- being extroverted as such, you'll have to deal with critics, detractors, show-boaters, and drunk people.

The first act wasn't bad, it was actually pretty funny watching actual comedians dealing with hecklers and their take on such people who would shout things to someone on stage. Act two however was a lot of Kennedy interviewing internet critics and then trying to make them look bad by acting like a child in every confrontation he would have with these geeky bloggers who fancy themselves writers. Jamie Kennedy made these people look like welcome company.

If he is going to whine about bad criticism then whine about the good too. He could go on about how unfair it is that people from the Oscars are recognized for their talent.

People have their own opinions about music, movies, tv, food, wine, virtually everything you can think of. If a lot of people say you are bad and your movies bomb every time and that bothers you so much, then maybe it's time to step back and look at the content you are putting out.

The film serves to remind us to be more gentle towards society in general.  All in all it is an interesting look at hecklers from the perspectives of comics, and a reminder that those people that we have put upon pedestals are, in fact, human.

I really enjoyed the clips of comedians and others dealing with actual hecklers. However, the movie is somewhat superficial in its exploration of this topic. It lumps crowd hecklers together with movie critics and online reviewers. I think this is a mistake. A crowd heckler is disrupting a show that people have gone there specifically to see. These people are being rude and inconsiderate. An online critic or a movie critic is not interrupting anything. They have an audience that they are writing for and while what they write may be rude, it is not inherently more wrong than a comedian making rude jokes. I think Kennedy does get that you can't do anything about hecklers. People will have opinions and you just can't allow yourself to get upset every time that happens. The movie does start an interesting discussion. I just wish it had dug a little deeper.",1343347200,,1023,4.785310734463277

GREAT AT COVERING THE TOPIC - AWFUL LANGUAGE BY COMICS TOO!! - AND I'M A COMEDIAN - WHO DOES NOT SWEAR!!
This DVD is very interesting!! - Especially the 1st half - and worth it just for that.  At 49:02 minutes a woman comic flashed her self (topless) I don't need to see nudity to understand heckling.
The language starts off bad and gets much worse. (I'm tried of swearing and vulgarity).
There are many short interviews - with many well known celebrities - and it seems Everyone gets dumped on and heckled at some point in their careers.
I read some of the other reviews here on Amazon - and now that I have seen this documentary - I'm thinking - well Duh!! - Of course it highlights Jamie Kennedy - He Made this video!! - Do you expect him to make a video and Not highlight himself!
This video shows highlights (or should I say lowlights?)
Early in the film - it shows Jamie being pelted by like water balloons or drinks - and there is NO explanation as to what is going on. I'm still curious.
Louie Anderson has a great line in here, and I can only paraphrase it at the moment:
""Resentment is the only product - that consumes it's own container."" I love that.
Again, the swearing and vulgarity - and brief nudity - are what brouht this film down from a 5 star to a 4 star. And I would give the swearing a Minus 5 star.
I do stand-up and over all I highly recommend this DVD to all performers and would be interesting to non-performers as well. Sincerely, Scott MacNeil.",1313539200,2,1587,4.254966887417218

3167599,5,B0017600EW,"First off this was a funny movie and an interesting behind the scenes look at a comedians life.  So thats enough reason to see it you can stop reading now and just go enjoy it.

If you are worried about the ""complainers"" type comments read on.

This movie deals with the suffering of famous, successful, and sometimes wealthy people.  Not the most sympathetic crowd which is why some people call this a movie about ""whiners"".

I didn't feel the movie was asking the audience for sympathy.  Rather the message was, it's disturbingly easy for people to be cruel to another group of humans they cannot relate to.

Think about how much of sadness is caused in this world because it is so easy think in terms of other groups of people is some disconnected way almost as if they are another species.  At a minimum didn't most of us get hit with this at some point growing up or in school?

Maybe I'd rather be a rich hated celebrity than a kid who gets made fun of in school.  But we do know one thing they have in common is the ability to make people depressed, choose substance abuse, or worse.  Forget that this happens to celebrities - Lets just let it remind us of how often it happens everyone.

Empathy is usually a produtive thing.",1298073600,6,1233,4.407079646017699
3167600,1,B0017600EW,"The difference between a poetry reading and a comedy show is that a poetry reading is supposed to be a ""safe and supporting"" show where everyone comes out and helps the artist to achieve his potential and people actually pay to see a comedy show. Why do people actually watch comedy shows? Because theoretically, only the bravest and best survive in a continual battle with audience's expectations. Comedians need to make people laugh and sometimes they not only make the audience hate them but they also get hecklers.

This movie should have been a great examination of the relationship between comics and the people who hate them. Instead its a whine fest starring Jaime Kennedy as the nastiest human being on the planet. Did you think that he was merely a mediocre comic, the dumbed down equivalent of Seth Green? Guess what. He's a terrible loathsome human being and he is out to punish everyone. The comics who talk about hecklers begin to take a second seat to Jaime Kennedy complaining and turning it around on the hecklers. He invites the hecklers backstage and he yells at them. However, if he wanted sympathy maybe he shouldn't have shown them heckling him when he was telling a lame joke about how country music sucks. There's even a comedian telling a ""she had it coming"" joke about the woman that Robert Blake killed and then just as you think he can't get any less funny, he screams at the audience.

Even better, the movie quickly abandons the conceit of talking about actual hecklers and moving on to movie critics. And then just to make matters more pathetic, he has a cartload of talking heads saying that critics don't know anything. Sure, Perez Hilton and TMZ are awful and terrible creeps but every actor and director is out to get most of the critics as know nothing idiots. In fact, the critics are even saying hateful things about each other (Chud.com and Leonard Maltin take turns hating on each other) and the directors can be even more ironic since Joel Schumacher is saying that no one wants to be a critic and that Batman Forever shouldn't be criticized so much because it's a comic book and what do the critics want anyhow? Gone with the Wind? No, the critics want a movie that doesn't plod along like a glacier.

Of course, the saddest part about this movie is the fact that Jaime Kennedy brings up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Mask-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B00080ZFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Mask (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;over and over again. He even invites over movie critics (online or otherwise) in order to complain about their hostile reviews of his terrible terrible movies. He's nasty and hostile and full of himself. He claims that he's ""talented"" and he quickly goes to the ad hominem jokes like ""You live at Comic-Con"" (because I guess he thinks that the critic is a nerd or something). He keeps asking the question ""why are you being so mean to me?"" as if they didn't force themselves to sit through his awful movies. He should be apologizing to these critics, not trying to get them to apologize to him. He even tries to make a case for critics being terrible human beings because a movie that his friend made starring him was never released and his friend hasn't made a movie since 1998. THen he undercuts his point by showing a scene from that movie and it's even worse than The Son of Mask.

If you want to know how pathetic this movie is just note that Dr. Drew is the resident ""mental health expert"" because apparently Jaime Kennedy telling people that he has feelings isn't proof enough that Kennedy is hurting. He needs Dr. Drew to make him sound like less of a creep.

THe only good points of the movie are when Jaime interviews critics who hate Son of the Mask and they don't back down. That's pretty awesome. But it's not awesome to give this movie any more than one star since the next scene is a comedian comparing critics who give bad reviews to Lee Harvey Oswald.

3167602,2,B0017600EW,"Please tell me that I am not the only one who noticed the glaring hypocrisy in this movie.  They talk about how some critics go beyond just criticizing the movie and sink to personal attacks instead just to be sensational.  And this is a completely valid point.  But then these same people who made that complaint do the exact same things to these critics.  Jamie Kennedy personaly attacks one critic saying that he's a nerd because he enjoys watching star trek and that he must go to comic book conventions all the time.  Others talk about how these critics must be losers who never get laid and live in their parents basement etc.

When they try to make more valid arguments against critics they don't do any better.  There is one part where they go off on how focus groups are pointless.  John Luvitz tried to use the analogy to explain what focus groups are like: if someone watched every lakers game for the last 20 years that doesn't qualify them to coach the lakers.  That's true but these focus groups aren't saying they can know direct and star in their own movies.  A focus group is when a studio wants to see how the target market for a certain movie will react so they go get this demographic, show them the movie and ask them what they think.  If everyone in the focus group says a certain scene was horrible and they are your target market then you should probably cut out that scene.",1286409600,5,1398,4.443137254901961

Any movie maker that gives work to the obese deserves five amazon.com movie review stars. It's not gonna hurt you to give this movie five stars plus it can't do anything but help Jamie's career.

3167605,1,B0017600EW,"This movie is not what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be a documentary about hecklers and how able-minded comedians deal with them and it's not. It's mostly just testimonies from people in the public eye who think it's unfair that others can openly criticize their work. All hecklers may be critics but few critics are hecklers. A heckler is someone who intententally wants to unnerve a live performer during their ""act"". A critic is simply someone that's has an opinion and informs others of that opinion. Everyone has opinions. They should be allowed to vocalize them. That's the whole concept behind freedom of speech. From the perspective of several people interviewed in this movie, only comedians should be allowed to criticize other comics, because only comics know what another comedian is going through. Well, if that's the case, then comedians shouldn't be able to criticize anyone but other comics. Now if they adhered to that concept, it wouldn't leave most of these humourists with a lot of material to work with, now would it? If you put yourself out there expect to be criticized. That's life and no amount of crying is going to change that. There's a couple points in the movie where Jamie points out that someone out there compared him to Pauly Shore and he takes it as an insult. By him admitting that he's hurt by that he's openly criticizing Pauly Shore. How could he not realize this? It's blatantly obvious. It does hurt to put effort into something just to have it shot down by others but if it wasn't for critics no one would ever get better at what they do because everybody would believe that what they are currently doing is good enough because no one has told them otherwise. We're hard-wired to be critics. That's how we learn, that's how we evolve. If it wasn't for critics, people would make more unsatisfying purchases then they currently do. I usually try to take someone else's opinion into consideration before I buy anything. I might end up not agreeing with those opinions after my purchaces but at least I went into it with some guidance. Should everyone just ignore what everyone else thinks? You should make up your own mind about things but none of us have infinite time to investigate everything to the fullest extent. I turn to critics I trust who I have repeatedly ended up agreeing with. I also give consideration to opinions from ""complete nobodies"" because I'm nobody special either. Should I just let comedians decide for me which other comedians are funny? I've heard repeatedly that the majority of comedians are inclined towards bitterness when one of their peers has more success than they do.

3167606,5,B0017600EW,"""Heckler"" is a look behind the velvet rope, but it's an uncensored, unattractive, blunt and blatant look that some may even find shocking because it's really a topic that has never been taken so seriously; until now.

Until I saw Jamie Kennedy's awesome flick, ""Heckler"" I didn't know that there are some critics who consider him unfunny. I have always been a huge Jamie Kennedy fan because he's original and so relatable. He's also a very talented writer, actor and is great with slapstick. Why someone would want to tear him down is a question that I am sure we will never get a lucid answer to.

This film is about the man behind the laughs. And it's not just about Jamie, he takes a step back and we see the entire view. ""Heckler"" is a very real film that is both funny and even somewhat tragic because it shows how far our society will go to both raise people up and then tear them down out of a devious pleasure.

The film includes interviews with some of the biggest entertainers including: Arsenio, Rob Zombie, Henry Winkler, Roseanne Barr and George Lucas. The film even includes rare and archival clips of President Reagan (of all people, being heckled) and even Barbra Streisand responding to a heckler at an '06 concert.

There is also a lot of comedy mixed in for good measure (I love the joke Ron Jeremy said that one critic once said he had an ugly penis.) The basic message of this film is that we all have a responsibility; be it at a concert, a sporting event, a comedy show or in the anonymous world of the Internet (where it seems that the claws are sharpening just as fast as the axes are grinding), and that is to show respect to others. Because words can hurt.

Included are some fascinating and informative interviews with some of comedies best men, including: Andrew 'Dice' Clay, Tom Green, Paul Rodriguez, a very unabashed and rather prolific Louie Anderson, and Jon Lovitz. I also especially enjoyed Carrot Top (the reigning poster boy for the hecklee). Carrot Top was able to provide a real prospective on what it's like to be drug through the trenches for years on end, for no other reason than viciousness. To me, someone like Carrot Top, (like Jamie Kennedy) is a true survivor because he's able to let his talent stand alone without letting the haters/hecklers/critics/bloggers/reviewers affect his art adversely.

""Heckler"" is for anyone who enjoys comedy or true-to-life films that have an extraordinarily comprehensive message. Right now the film is in rotation on Showtime (good luck trying to find anything halfway decent on Home Box), but you may just want to pick up the DVD since it's priced so low (and well worth it).

I never realized how sensitive Jamie Kennedy is; it must have taken a lot of courage to show this side of himself because I am sure there are some haters out there looking to sink their fangs into anything he does (no matter how artistic and creative it is). Jamie even interviews some ""professional critics"" who have gone out of their ways to bring him down. It was fascinating because all he wanted to know was ""why"" do they do it? We don't get an answer, but sometimes we really don't need an answer to a question to find the cause (envy, jealousy, resentment and self-loathing all have the loudest ring of truth). It was also fascinating watching Jamie speak to some of his other ""commentators"" (those hateful people who spew vitriol over the Internet); trying to find out why they have so much rage, and perhaps not surprisingly, none of them could articulate himself to the point of comprehension. It was like watching a doped-up deer caught in the headlights of a stretch limo.

3167618,4,B0017600EW,"If I were ever provoked to write reviews about Jamie Kennedy's widely criticized work in film (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Mask/dp/B00080ZFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Mask</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malibu-s-Most-Wanted/dp/B0000AGQ6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malibu's Most Wanted</a>) I'm really not sure I would've been so hateful and intentionally provocative.  Maybe that is what separates a guy like me, who writes as a hobby and simply because I love movies, from guys who write to make their employers money and get attention.  That however does not excuse the fact that his films are solid examples of how to make a movie that the mainstream will most likely ridicule.

Heckler is Kennedy's reaction to his own failures and the backlash that he has suffered for finding a niche in entertainment just large enough to afford him the opportunity to capitalize further on his fame. That isn't to say Kennedy deserves to be attacked as a person.  Heckler covers three groups of hecklers and interviews moderately famous comedians that all react to the dynamic of public criticism.  The first group is the classic comedy heckler, which is the least controversial simply because most of the time the average person will find themselves rooting against the heckler who is ruining a live stand-up routine.  The second group is the film critic, and that segment shows examples of film critics perhaps going a bit too far and taking their reviews into very personally insulting territory.  The third segment covers internet criticism, which in my humble view can be a most vile domain for hatred and dishonesty.  Kennedy goes from scene to scene in a very self-deprecating way and in the end I found myself actually laughing right along.  There is some irony there of course, as I only finally find Kennedy's strengths as he attempts to direct fire at those who criticize almost every other move he has made throughout his career.

The moments with celebrity personalities range from genuinely eye-opening and fresh, to incredibly blunt and humorous, and finally to shockingly egotistical and hypocritical; even for Hollywood.  One scene has Kennedy with fellow heckler target and prop-comedian Carrot Top.  Kennedy reads something to Carrot Top about his film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chairman-of-the-Board/dp/1573623989/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chairman of the Board</a>.  The blurb is insulting and personal and Kennedy, both frustrated and empathetic, asks Carrot Top how he should respond to someone like that.  Carrot Top simply says that he would ask them to come see his show.  I was actually impressed because I then realized that Carrot Top does his thing and people go and pay to see him, for better or worse.  On the other hand, celebrities like Bill Mahr and Roseanne coming out to attack critics as unqualified or untalented ego-maniacs, and voicing their opposition with rage and personal attacks was so transparently hypocritical that I had to think Kennedy and the others behind the scenes were playing both sides.  Nevertheless, this is a very entertaining film about a surprisingly interesting topic.  I definitely recommend it.",1239580800,2,3321,5.7566462167689165
3167619,5,B0017600EW,"I have only a fleeting knowledge of Jamie Kennedy's films, and this review of Heckler is based solely on that film's content. Apparently, there is something about Kennedy that inspires outrage in an audience that is simultaneously attracted to his comedy, yet bitterly resentful of his success. Some of these detractors are marginally in the public eye and devote way too much effort and time to heaping criticism on something they allegedly care so little about.

The subject of Heckler goes way beyond the experiences of Jamie Kennedy and shows endless samples of moronic audience behavior leveled at other entertainers. The examples cover a broad range, but some are no more than playground obscenity with no real commentary offered. To balance it all out, however, we're even treated to the sight of a guitar-playing comic who went out of control and bashed a heckler over the head with his instrument. (God only knows how much he had endured before he was driven to that lapse in judgement.)

But it's always the attacks against Kennedy that are the most fascinating. Watching him read some of these viscous ""reviews"" out loud to their authors was fabulous. Their floundering efforts to justify gross personal insults were laughable and adolescent. However, in another case the intense smirking of a relentlessly insulting ""critic"" was disturbingly flirtatious and, frankly, nauseating. Mr. Kennedy is obviously a man with tremendous self-control. A lesser man would have knocked him out of his chair.

Mere hecklers shout out whatever they can to instantly take attention away from the performer and put it on themselves. Are so-called professional ""critics"" any different from hecklers? In an era of sound bites, critical analysis with real content has been replaced by the clever quip with the potential to destroy the prospects of a project that took years to complete.

Heckler is tremendously thought-provoking and provided real insight into the world of performers subject to this abuse. Don't miss it!",1239580800,,2014,5.187692307692307
3167620,5,B0017600EW,"I really never thought I'd say this about a Jamie Kennedy film, but this one is superb.  I admit I've never been a big fan of Kennedy (although he did make me laugh sometimes on THE JAMIE KENNEDY EXPERIMENT), but after seeing this, I have a whole new respect for him.

I related to some of the people in HECKLER, having been the victim of criticism myself.  The movie isn't just about ""hecklers,"" but about how cruel people can be, which is a topic I've wondered about often; why are we so cruel to people we don't even know?  I question it most when a person isn't known at all, but even I've said mean things about famous people.  I guess it's because you can be more honest in terms of criticism (whether it's of a performance or just how someone looks) when you don't have to take a person's feelings into account.  It feels freer.  But that doesn't make it right.

Some of my favorite comics, actors, and others speak in this film.  Even the people I didn't know or like, though, made me listen.  I know how it feels to be hurt and criticized, and yes, you have to expect it, especially if you get into show business, but I'm glad Kennedy made this film.  Entertainers, filmmakers, comics, and actors all have feelings, too.  And some of them have great zingers to heckler's noise.

I do wish there had been more female comics (or other entertainers), but I was glad to see Maria Bamford and Jewel among the ladies who appeared.

HECKLER is one of the better ways I've spent an hour and a half, and it's nice to not wish I could get the time back after watching a film.  That happens too often these days.  I have to say, Jamie Kennedy impressed me and I'll be more open to his work in the future.",1238976000,,1702,4.30503144654088

Maybe critics who see this might just take a little edge off of their mean spirited remarks now?  I hope so.  performer's don't need to be lied to, we need truth, but certainly not mean truth.  Jamie has done a great job on this film, I can highly suggest that you buy it, watch it, as it was really worth the time, and then some.  The number of performers in this is amazing too.  It was presented very well, edited very well, and took us on a great ride through the performer's world of emotions.

First off, I am not a J.K. fan nor a detractor.  As far as I'm concerned he has not ruined a movie for me.  Nor has he made a movie great for me.  Though he was one of the best parts of Scream.  And though THE WRITERS ruined his charachter in the later movies by milking it, that was not his fault.  And he was still good.  The other movies I have seen him in were hit or miss for me.  Either way, nobody deserves reviews like he has gotten.

That being said, a heckler is far more unwanted than anything he has given us.  I have never seen his stand-up, but my guess is that he didn't make it this far if some of it wasn't entertaining.

Now as for this movie, it's a great commentary on what it's like to be criticized negatively and how it affects people.  It seems the world forgets these are still people with feelings.  I think people review based on personal feeling towards a person too often (Tom Cruise deserves that), but for the most part that's not fair.  This points out the faults of these reviews and the characters that write them.

This was a good documentary.  It never showed Jamie Kennedy being hilarious and then said ""See, I'm funny.""  It showed just who he is and what he did and then what people said about him.  Then asked you to decide what is right to do.

You may not think he's funny.  But maybe you will think twice before trying to hurt the person when reviewing them.  Especially the internet slams.",1226016000,,1612,4.182410423452769

The interviewees include everyone from the Fonz to Princess Leia to Doctor Drew to Andrew Dice Clay to Bill Maher to Andy Kindler to Craig Feguson. And all of the above have interesting opinions on the subject of hecklers.

It was a bit of a stretch comparing film criticism to heckling, and the only way Kennedy could make the point work was by ignoring film criticism that celebrates good filmmaking.  There's still plenty of that around, and presumably Kennedy is well aware of this, as he's been associated with a number of films that have gotten good reviews.  Also, his point about critics giving snider reviews than necessary is a valid one, but it's nothing new.  Bosley Crowther and Paul Kael were capable of eviscerating crap way back when.",1223856000,2,859,4.8231292517006805

As for the thumbs up reviews, I'm with them...I give credit to Jamie Kennedy along with the other comedians who contributed to this film for taking a stand against hecklers and shedding a different light on a subject that really is often overlooked. I loved all of the different commentaries from all of the different performers ranging from Carrot Top to Louie Anderson to Roseann Barr..this is a film definately worth watching especially if you love watching comedy...it will make you think twice before heckling an onstage comedian ever...definately CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT...it is very entertaining..",1222214400,4,956,5.214285714285714
3402058,4,B0017600EW,"I liked this documentary.  There were a number of really great ideas touched here, but there were problems with it as well.

First the good.

This is a topic that is not talked about too much yet to me is very fascinating. I really enjoy looking behind the scenes of the standup comic world.

The documentary in a blunt way gave the critics a little bit of ""the golden rule"".

There were numerous interviews with comedians that I really admire who said some very interesting and insightful comments, such as Lewis Black, David Cross, Dave Atell, and Patton Oswalt to name a few.

There were psychologists and other professionals interviewed who also made interesting points.

The bad..

This documentary did not really make its points clearly and concisely.  There were many good ideas touched on, but not investigated as they should have been. Such as the egos in both performers and in critics.  If Mr. Kennedy is sad about being Heckled than maybe he should consider another field of work, obviously his ego is really tied into showbiz and showbiz is not for the thin skinned.

Yet, much of the heckling and criticism is very mean spirited, cruel and self-serving. Heckling is just rude.  There is usually just a drunk person who wants attention or has a personality disorder.

Criticism, in my opinion, should explain why one does not like something.  Though critics are often correct in their assessments, it is not fair just to say that one does not like something, then get mean spirited about it. If one is not able to give a good reason for not liking something, then one should not be a critic.  A critic has to know what makes things good or bad, not just be intuitive about it and being mean spirited seems to be the replacement for that knowledge and it is self-serving to the critic only and does nothing to change or improve the entertainer.

There were also some of the interviews which were pointless and did not add to the documentary or were redundant or tangential.",1221696000,4,1985,4.677233429394812
3402059,1,B0017600EW,"Ok, my bias is upfront. I have had the displeasure of watching multiple movies 'starring' Jamie Kennedy and all are the same. He plays a white man who thinks he's black who is either mentally retarded or is 'young in his mind' (not naive, but stupid). Each movie he makes is faced is a barrage of bad reviews (because they are bad) and this is his triumphant battle call....

Of ""shut up!"".

The gull Kennedy has is amazing. He compares critics with hecklers as if they are the same. Hecklers halt performances whereas critics write about an item AFTER the performance is done. Not only that, he seems to think that critics have nothing good to say. The fact of the matter is that the general public has a set amount of funds and have to decide whether or not to see a movie. One good place to find info is rottentomatoes or other sites with multiple reviews, highlighting the good and bad opinions. Jamie is just pissed that his page holds a miserable rating because he makes miserable movies. Rather than learn from the critics, like many wiser comedians (I can't morally call Jamie a comedian though) and many film makers. The last scene shows it all. Rather than take constructive criticism, Jamie lights his reviews on fire and dances like a moron around them.

What's even more horrible is that the heckler in Jamie's audience is FUNNIER than Jamie is. Here, right in the trailer with no shame...
Heckler - ""Why don't you make like a Kennedy and drop dead!""
Kennedy - ""You know the difference between you and me? I came here in a limo.""

How is that funny, Jamie? How did that put him in his place? But this is coming from an untalented, unfunny, liar. (On his personal youtube he claims he punk'd Penn and Teller on their own show by providing a short clip. If one is to watch the whole episode Penn clearly calls Kennedy and his pal out as performance artists....but hey, if you fail constantly I guess you need to create a mystical word of fantasy to think you matter)

Great Job, Kennedy. Since I was so mean to you in this review allow me to make it up to you by writing some words you'll never see albeit in this review...

3402060,3,B0017600EW,"This movie isn't so much about hecklers as it is about Critics. All of the funny comedians are reduced to very brief clips, and don't nearly distract from the obvious focus of this dacumentary: Jamie Kennedy's inability to accept the fact that his body of work is the subject of criticism.
  To be fair, Mr Kennedy wanting to confront internet debasers who mearly sling hurtful and often violent insults is admirable enough. After a while though it becomes evident that Jamie has some serious personal issues, and his valid hurt gives way to a full on pity party. With the likes of none other than Carrot Top commiserating with Jamie Kennedy about how negative reviews have hurts their feelings beyond repair.
  This movie really lost me though when it championed Ewe Bolle's ""put up or shut up"" campaign against his critics. It shows highlights of the boxing matches, playing triumphant music while Bolle pummels those who dare speak ill of the likes of House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark. As a movie watcher I cannot suspend disbelief to the point where I root for Ewe Bolle. People can fly, be named Hellboy, the dork gets the girl, but Ewe Bolle is not a due any amount of sympathy.
  In the end, I did take some of this to heart. The internet does make it easy to namelessly efface the work of others ( hell, I'm doing it right now ) and it's important that reviews be informative and not simply an opportunity to make yourself look smart by trashing someone else. Was it Jamie Kennedy'd fault his movies weren't very good? No, and his e-critics would have done well to point the finger at the individuals higher up the chain. It is, however, important to remember than Jammie Kennedy was paid more than several years worth of most peoples salaries to make his movies, and the public has only limited funds/time to spend on entertainment.

Then the long drawn out discussion of critics which had nothing to do with the act of heckling other than it too offends the performers.

He is invited to a workshop comedian group but cant understand why telling jokes hes found on the Internet isn't acceptable and feels humiliated by Steve and the students.  He then decides to yell out the punchlines to Steves act the next night which Steve poorly handles by humiliating him.  They have an altercation in the toilets after which leaves Mike dead.  However Mike isn't gone, his face and voice taunts Steves next performance, and when his agent sends him to visit Dr Seinfeld, or hell be pulling him from a nationally televised gig, he receives a help CD to listen to in his sleep.  The next day Steve awakes outside of his body, he cant touch, communicate or move anything.  To make matters worse his body is walking around and his heckler is inside.

Its a fairly enjoyable movie.  I was expecting maybe a few more stand up lines from a variety of comedians but the movie more focuses on the girlfriend, ex wife and father parts of Steves life.  The ending was a bit of a letdown and I don't think one of the characters would go where they did.  By the way if you don't understand the Logies reference in the film, Logies are Australias equivalent of Emmy Awards.

With the advent of the internet, like myself, everyone has an opinion these days. All forms of art suffer from criticism however; art itself, music, movies, photography. There are message boards galore on ratings for a good plumber in your area, doctors, contractors and so on. If you're going to put yourself out there, in any form, there are going to be haters. It comes with the territory. We judge everyday without even being aware of it. In Jamie's defense there are some very harsh people out there. It's perfectly okay if you don't like someone or what they put out there as entertainment or art or whatever. It is just my opinion that there are too many people crossing into this extreme territory of hate and other forms of extreme criticism.

You're a performer who people pay to see make fun of others...  You can't be so thick skinned when it turns on you.

The video briefly starts with hecklers, and then moves on to critics who didn't like his B movies.  (How can you be offended when people like the Mask better than a cut-rate sequel?)  It starts with a bunch of folks calling critics people who have never done anything relevant in their lives.  Then it moves on to accuse critics of trying to be performance artists on their own.  Umm...  For the same reason that comedians have to shock as entertainers, critics have to also...

But halfway through, the movie just stops being about hecklers, and then tries to draw a parallel between hecklers and critics.  Apart from the fact that this just seems tangential and weirdly preachy for the duration of the film, the movie kind of undermines itself and fails to prove its own themes.  For one, the film's negative stance on critics is really poorly supported by the fact that they primarily interview comedians, who are some of the harshest and most outspoken critics of other artists and celebrities.  Patton Oswalt, for instance, has talked about Paris Hilton being eaten by wolves.  It's also unclear what we're supposed to take away from the movie.  Yes, some critics, like hecklers, are just selfish bullies, but does that mean that no one has the right to criticize anything or anyone because sometimes people get their feelings hurt?  Many critics, especially artists who criticize other artists, do so because they care about their art form.  Dave Grohl has ripped into Nickelback because he believes they're ruining music.  Sometimes criticism is mean for the sake of being mean, sometimes it's unsubstantiated or uninformed, sometimes it's used to bolster insecure egos, but other times it's constructive and even necessary.  Nevertheless, there's some really interesting, thought-provoking stuff in this documentary, whether you agree with the film or not.

Some people just want attention, some are jealous, some critics are creative and deeply dedicated. The internet certainly makes it easy for people to just say, you suck. They don't edit themselves 100 some times like a letter writer might. They don't ponder or do deep analysis.  Many just do character assassinations.

I once thoughtlessly wrote a lazy analysis of a poem which was written long ago, and had  imagery that simply turned me off.  I more or less said that the poem sucked.  The teacher let me know that I didn't even comprehend the poem.  He was right.  I had to read that stinkin' poem hundreds of times before I actually understood what the poet was saying (my problem, not his). I still don't like the poem or this particular poet because I don't like his style for many reasons.  But I liked what I came to understand he was saying, found it profound, and understood that I sucked on first analysis, not him.

There is much to be gained from thoughtfully disliking or liking something.  I got so much out of this documentary that has me still thinking on it.",1371859200,4,1438,4.784552845528455
3402080,5,B0017600EW,"This movie's premise is to indict hecklers and critics for standing in the way of art and expose them for the pathetic sad sacks that they are. The editing and production are slanted in a way that we are supposed to appreciate the likes of Jamie Kennedy and Uwe Boll as gifted people and all who oppose this point of view are irrational haters and failures as human beings with no valid points or criticisms. The finished product fails at this premise because everyone heckling Jamie Kennedy have, far and away, have the most entertaining lines.  They try to endict critics but yet they have the best diggs. It didn't help the cause when JK's opening comedian keeps laughing at everything these aleged haters had to say. They try to have some of the most undefensible people like Eli Roth and George Lucas to represent proud visionary entertainers. Then they feature some of the most hilarious hecklers soundly destroying some of the most dispicable comedians. All this comes off as satire to me. It feels ironic and silly like ""This is Spinal Tap"" but I know the makers of this documentary where going for a more serious tone.

To put it in another way; its like say you wanted to do a documentary about oppressive government trying to muffle free speach. In your mind, you are thinking about people like Nelson Mendela or Ghandi and you say,"" yes, I want you to tell that story"". Then the producers go out and film someone like Adolf Hitler from his pre ""Mine Kampf"" days. Yes, I am comparing Jamie Kennedy to Adolf Hilter, but only as an analogy to how damaging they are to the world and how big a douche bags they must be. I'm sure they only selected a hack like Jamie Kennedy because a hack like Dane Cook would have wanted too much money. If you need evidence of Jamie Kennedy being a douche, look up anything on youtube that involves him at E3. This dude seems like he is always drunk or doped up or something. The least he could do is comb his hair or actualy tell a funny joke. I cannot take this movie very seriuosly because they try to silence too many valid criticisms and portray some irreprehensible celebrities as martyrs. Go and watch that Jamie Kennedy E3 hosting footage on youtube and tell me if JK is the Jesus this movie makes him out to be.

Aside from the vile aforementioned, there are alot of appearances from other big names in comedy such as; Louis CK, Patton Oswalt, Louis Black speaking, Joe Rogan and many other actualy funny people talking about their own experiences with heckling. Then you have the sweet Henry Winkler talking about how hurtful criticisms can be. I think these people all thought they was in some different documentary. People like Andrew Dice Clay and Jamie Kennedy have no place speaking alongside real talented comedians like Dave Atel. This is why the premise of the movie falls apart and you begin to side with the demonized Hecklers. After watching this movie, I asked myself a question that the movie asked,""what kid wants to grow up and be a critic""? This guy, right here. This movie had the oppesed effect it set out to create. Now, I think I would actualy pay money to tell certain people off. This movie is actualy encouraging me to do mean things I had never contemplated.

Bottom line, movie was the hilarious. I completely enjoyed myself. This will easily be the most funny, if not only funny thing that is tied to Jamie Kennedy's name. I recommend you watch it today with a friend who has a sense of humor and knows good things from things that are whack, so you don't feel isolated or alone for having normal tendancies to look at people like Louie Anderson sideways.",1363564800,,3633,4.567484662576687

3402082,1,B0017600EW,"The blatant bait-and-switch that this film attempts to pull is just astounding. It starts off as supposedly a film about hecklers, and how public performers, mostly standup comedians, react to them as a phenomenon.

Then 25 minutes in, it complete veers off into talking not about hecklers, but about CRITICS. Director Michael Addis tries to justify this threadbare analogy by asking what the difference is between the two, and showing one or two interviewees who entertain this notion, like Craig Ferguson, who says that both are usually drunk and stupid, or author John Ridley, who compares the heckler's ""You suck"" to the critic's ""The performance wasn't that good.""

Um, no.

The former is obnoxious, and comes from someone who is not an articulate writer paid to present his or her views in a forum that people pay or click on to read of their own volition. Hecklers merely disrupt a performance that many others paid to see, and do nothing but annoy others. By contrast, when a critic writes reviews you do not agree with or dislike, you can choose not to read them. The mere existence of a review by a critic you dislike doesn't disrupt your ability to read other parts of the paper.

I could've enjoyed a good documentary examining the practice of entertainment criticism, but this should've been a separate film, one distinct from one about hecklers, and which could've led to a discussion of the distinction between which critics are articulate, polite and thoughtful in their analysis of whether a film set out to do what it intended to for its targeted audience. Instead of focusing on that from the outset, Addis engages in what is either the worst narrative con-job I've ever seen in a documentary, or the worst instance of a filmmaker's inability to decide upon a consistent subject for his film.  One clue to this is that during the outtakes that are shown during the closing credits, when a band called The Used is solicited for an interview, the film is described to them as ""a documentary about critics"". So why wasn't the movie simply called ""Critics""? Draw your own conclusion from this.

Even as a film about critics, there seems to be, in the ""critics suck"" portion of the film, a preponderance of those who merely whine about receiving bad reviews, even when those are reviews are restrained, if critical. Jamie Kennedy makes an fool of himself when he confronts one critic and argues, that he would've liked ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" more if he had better sex prior to watching it, or denigrating another as attending a Trekkie or Comic-Con nerd. Yeah, Jamie. YOU'RE the cool one. I guess in Kennedy's view, ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" is good as a question of fact, and therefore, anyone who disagrees must therefore, ipso facto, be operating from some ulterior motive or personal problem coloring their reaction to it. It's almost as if Kennedy feels entitled to not get bad reviews. Similarly, Rob Zombie characterizes critics who give bad reviews to Spielberg films as sexless losers living in their parents' basement. Sure, Rob. That's the reason critics said that ""Jurassic Park II"" wasn't that good. It's not because the film wasn't that good. No, it's because of the critics' problems. This is par for the course throughout the film, with everyone from to Perez Hilton to Uwe Boll jumping on the argumentum ad hominem bandwagon, completely failing to distinguish between gratuitous vitriol and dismissal of any and all legitimate criticism.  If there is any credence given to the idea that criticism is a valid form of writing, and that some critics are talented, insightful essayists who indeed serve the audiences who come to appreciate them as good gauges based on their simpatico tastes, it's almost completely absent from ""Heckler"". Some brief lip service paid to Roger Ebert as one exception, but it is used as a springboard to dismiss even  him by pointing out the poor quality of the one film whose screenplay he did write, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"". Criss Angel is shown saying that he listens to critics in order to improve his work, but the film abruptly cuts away from him before he can elaborate.

The film eventually broadens its scope to criticism of ANY TYPE, as when Eli Roth whines about focus groups, which he calls the death of cinema. He makes the point that those in focus groups should not necessarily be taken as accurate barometers of the national or global audience for a film, but then undercuts this argument (which could've set a respectable tone for the film, and provoked dialogue among the film's subjects and its viewers), by referring to a focus group attendee as a ""fat girl from Cleveland"" and a ""f***"". I'm not sure what's funnier, his hypocrisy in decrying polite criticism by moviegoers by criticizing them impolitely himself, or his referring to his work as ""cinema"".

Even criticism itself is thrown out the window as a unifying theme, when instances of Jewel, Jim Everett and Andrew Dice Clay being denigrated by obnoxious interviewers are included as relevant cases. So undiscriminating is Addis about what he is willing to throw into this chop suey of a film, that he even profiles actress Nicole Madich, who talks about being bullied as a teen for being small-breasted (which she proves to us by showing us her bare breasts), and Jody Vaclav, who talks about reaction to her being a transsexual. If Vaclav is an actress or comedian, I don't know, since the film only identifies her as ""transsexual"". What these two interviews have to do with critics, much less the film's title, is anyone's guess.

Yes, there are critics who are nothing more than obnoxious nihilists with who simply revel in negativity and are about as thoughtful and balanced in their assessments as Joseph Goebbels reincarnated as a rabid snake, like the utterly obnoxious blogger that Kennedy confronts while on G4'th ""The Live Feed"", but the film not only lacks balance, and a desire to ask its subjects what the criteria are for good reviews and bad ones, it lacks any cogent thesis. It simply either doesn't know what it wants to be about, or tries to fool the viewer into believing it's about one thing that's actually conflated with several other things, and beyond the first 25 minutes, just resembles a pityfest by Jamie Kennedy and other performers grumbling in indiscriminate fashion over anyone who doesn't provide them with uncritical adulation.",1352937600,23,6404,4.887661141804788
3402083,3,B0017600EW,"I watched this documentary over the weekend and it was just ok.  It starts out being pretty good.  It shows people heckling comedians and how the comedians react and then interviews them on their view point on hecklers. This part of the movie was really good and shows you how big of idiots people can be.

Then it takes a turn for the worse.  The rest of the movie is Jamie Kennedy confronting ""critics"" and demanding to know why they did not like what ever he did, be it stand up or a movie.  I understand Mr. Kennedy's feelings that sometimes these critics are not critiquing his film or work but him personally but he really must understand that that is what comes with the career he choose.

Being criticized by drunks trying to get attention is a form of bullying and it was refreshing to see so many artists talk about it.  There are some great interviews with some of my favorites: David Cross and Patton Oswalt, for example. However, I started to realize this documentary was centered around Kennedy being upset for the mostly terrible reviews he was getting for his movies.  Many of the reviews were done by non-critics and Kennedy spends time trying to figure out why they said they things they did. Personally, I'm not a fan of his stand up but I do think the message of the documentary is important and timely.",1351728000,,763,4.637037037037037

I was expecting something along the lines of this...however, I could only get through thirty minutes of it before I was simply fatigued and bored with whining.  The documentary overstates the obvious -- people on stage hate being heckled, have feelings, hate getting bad reviews, etc.  I understand that -- but the fact of the matter is that comedians, and for that matter, most people who have put themselves on the stage or in the public eye, should expect nothing else but be at the mercy of their crowd.  I feel as though it's part of the job description -- being extroverted as such, you'll have to deal with critics, detractors, show-boaters, and drunk people.

Act two however was a lot of Kennedy interviewing internet critics and then trying to make them look bad by acting like a child in every confrontation he would have with these geeky bloggers who fancy themselves writers. Jamie Kennedy made these people look like welcome company.

If he is going to whine about bad criticism then whine about the good too. He could go on about how unfair it is that people from the Oscars are recognized for their talent.

People have their own opinions about music, movies, tv, food, wine, virtually everything you can think of. If a lot of people say you are bad and your movies bomb every time and that bothers you so much, then maybe it's time to step back and look at the content you are putting out.

All in all it is an interesting look at hecklers from the perspectives of comics, and a reminder that those people that we have put upon pedestals are, in fact, human.

It lumps crowd hecklers together with movie critics and online reviewers. I think this is a mistake. A crowd heckler is disrupting a show that people have gone there specifically to see. These people are being rude and inconsiderate. An online critic or a movie critic is not interrupting anything. They have an audience that they are writing for and while what they write may be rude, it is not inherently more wrong than a comedian making rude jokes. I think Kennedy does get that you can't do anything about hecklers. People will have opinions and you just can't allow yourself to get upset every time that happens.

GREAT AT COVERING THE TOPIC - AWFUL LANGUAGE BY COMICS TOO!! - AND I'M A COMEDIAN - WHO DOES NOT SWEAR!!
This DVD is very interesting!! - Especially the 1st half - and worth it just for that.  At 49:02 minutes a woman comic flashed her self (topless) I don't need to see nudity to understand heckling.
The language starts off bad and gets much worse. (I'm tried of swearing and vulgarity).
There are many short interviews - with many well known celebrities - and it seems Everyone gets dumped on and heckled at some point in their careers.
I read some of the other reviews here on Amazon - and now that I have seen this documentary - I'm thinking - well Duh!! - Of course it highlights Jamie Kennedy - He Made this video!! - Do you expect him to make a video and Not highlight himself!
This video shows highlights (or should I say lowlights?)
Early in the film - it shows Jamie being pelted by like water balloons or drinks - and there is NO explanation as to what is going on. I'm still curious.
Louie Anderson has a great line in here, and I can only paraphrase it at the moment:
""Resentment is the only product - that consumes it's own container."" I love that.
Again, the swearing and vulgarity - and brief nudity - are what brouht this film down from a 5 star to a 4 star. And I would give the swearing a Minus 5 star.

If you are worried about the ""complainers"" type comments read on.

This movie deals with the suffering of famous, successful, and sometimes wealthy people.  Not the most sympathetic crowd which is why some people call this a movie about ""whiners"".

I didn't feel the movie was asking the audience for sympathy.  Rather the message was, it's disturbingly easy for people to be cruel to another group of humans they cannot relate to.

Think about how much of sadness is caused in this world because it is so easy think in terms of other groups of people is some disconnected way almost as if they are another species.  At a minimum didn't most of us get hit with this at some point growing up or in school?

Maybe I'd rather be a rich hated celebrity than a kid who gets made fun of in school.

Forget that this happens to celebrities - Lets just let it remind us of how often it happens everyone.

3402097,1,B0017600EW,"The difference between a poetry reading and a comedy show is that a poetry reading is supposed to be a ""safe and supporting"" show where everyone comes out and helps the artist to achieve his potential and people actually pay to see a comedy show. Why do people actually watch comedy shows? Because theoretically, only the bravest and best survive in a continual battle with audience's expectations. Comedians need to make people laugh and sometimes they not only make the audience hate them but they also get hecklers.

This movie should have been a great examination of the relationship between comics and the people who hate them. Instead its a whine fest starring Jaime Kennedy as the nastiest human being on the planet. Did you think that he was merely a mediocre comic, the dumbed down equivalent of Seth Green? Guess what. He's a terrible loathsome human being and he is out to punish everyone. The comics who talk about hecklers begin to take a second seat to Jaime Kennedy complaining and turning it around on the hecklers. He invites the hecklers backstage and he yells at them. However, if he wanted sympathy maybe he shouldn't have shown them heckling him when he was telling a lame joke about how country music sucks. There's even a comedian telling a ""she had it coming"" joke about the woman that Robert Blake killed and then just as you think he can't get any less funny, he screams at the audience.

Even better, the movie quickly abandons the conceit of talking about actual hecklers and moving on to movie critics. And then just to make matters more pathetic, he has a cartload of talking heads saying that critics don't know anything. Sure, Perez Hilton and TMZ are awful and terrible creeps but every actor and director is out to get most of the critics as know nothing idiots. In fact, the critics are even saying hateful things about each other (Chud.com and Leonard Maltin take turns hating on each other) and the directors can be even more ironic since Joel Schumacher is saying that no one wants to be a critic and that Batman Forever shouldn't be criticized so much because it's a comic book and what do the critics want anyhow? Gone with the Wind? No, the critics want a movie that doesn't plod along like a glacier.

Of course, the saddest part about this movie is the fact that Jaime Kennedy brings up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Mask-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B00080ZFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Mask (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;over and over again. He even invites over movie critics (online or otherwise) in order to complain about their hostile reviews of his terrible terrible movies. He's nasty and hostile and full of himself. He claims that he's ""talented"" and he quickly goes to the ad hominem jokes like ""You live at Comic-Con"" (because I guess he thinks that the critic is a nerd or something). He keeps asking the question ""why are you being so mean to me?"" as if they didn't force themselves to sit through his awful movies. He should be apologizing to these critics, not trying to get them to apologize to him. He even tries to make a case for critics being terrible human beings because a movie that his friend made starring him was never released and his friend hasn't made a movie since 1998. THen he undercuts his point by showing a scene from that movie and it's even worse than The Son of Mask.

If you want to know how pathetic this movie is just note that Dr. Drew is the resident ""mental health expert"" because apparently Jaime Kennedy telling people that he has feelings isn't proof enough that Kennedy is hurting. He needs Dr. Drew to make him sound like less of a creep.

THe only good points of the movie are when Jaime interviews critics who hate Son of the Mask and they don't back down. That's pretty awesome. But it's not awesome to give this movie any more than one star since the next scene is a comedian comparing critics who give bad reviews to Lee Harvey Oswald.

Jamie Kennedy personaly attacks one critic saying that he's a nerd because he enjoys watching star trek and that he must go to comic book conventions all the time.  Others talk about how these critics must be losers who never get laid and live in their parents basement etc.

When they try to make more valid arguments against critics they don't do any better.  There is one part where they go off on how focus groups are pointless.  John Luvitz tried to use the analogy to explain what focus groups are like: if someone watched every lakers game for the last 20 years that doesn't qualify them to coach the lakers.  That's true but these focus groups aren't saying they can know direct and star in their own movies.  A focus group is when a studio wants to see how the target market for a certain movie will react so they go get this demographic, show them the movie and ask them what they think.

It's mostly just testimonies from people in the public eye who think it's unfair that others can openly criticize their work. All hecklers may be critics but few critics are hecklers. A heckler is someone who intententally wants to unnerve a live performer during their ""act"". A critic is simply someone that's has an opinion and informs others of that opinion. Everyone has opinions. They should be allowed to vocalize them. That's the whole concept behind freedom of speech. From the perspective of several people interviewed in this movie, only comedians should be allowed to criticize other comics, because only comics know what another comedian is going through. Well, if that's the case, then comedians shouldn't be able to criticize anyone but other comics. Now if they adhered to that concept, it wouldn't leave most of these humourists with a lot of material to work with, now would it? If you put yourself out there expect to be criticized. That's life and no amount of crying is going to change that. There's a couple points in the movie where Jamie points out that someone out there compared him to Pauly Shore and he takes it as an insult. By him admitting that he's hurt by that he's openly criticizing Pauly Shore. How could he not realize this? It's blatantly obvious. It does hurt to put effort into something just to have it shot down by others but if it wasn't for critics no one would ever get better at what they do because everybody would believe that what they are currently doing is good enough because no one has told them otherwise. We're hard-wired to be critics. That's how we learn, that's how we evolve. If it wasn't for critics, people would make more unsatisfying purchases then they currently do. I usually try to take someone else's opinion into consideration before I buy anything. I might end up not agreeing with those opinions after my purchaces but at least I went into it with some guidance. Should everyone just ignore what everyone else thinks? You should make up your own mind about things but none of us have infinite time to investigate everything to the fullest extent. I turn to critics I trust who I have repeatedly ended up agreeing with. I also give consideration to opinions from ""complete nobodies"" because I'm nobody special either. Should I just let comedians decide for me which other comedians are funny? I've heard repeatedly that the majority of comedians are inclined towards bitterness when one of their peers has more success than they do. They probably laugh less then the rest of us do.",1278288000,12,2710,4.74364406779661
3402103,5,B0017600EW,"""Heckler"" is a look behind the velvet rope, but it's an uncensored, unattractive, blunt and blatant look that some may even find shocking because it's really a topic that has never been taken so seriously; until now.

Until I saw Jamie Kennedy's awesome flick, ""Heckler"" I didn't know that there are some critics who consider him unfunny. I have always been a huge Jamie Kennedy fan because he's original and so relatable. He's also a very talented writer, actor and is great with slapstick. Why someone would want to tear him down is a question that I am sure we will never get a lucid answer to.

This film is about the man behind the laughs. And it's not just about Jamie, he takes a step back and we see the entire view. ""Heckler"" is a very real film that is both funny and even somewhat tragic because it shows how far our society will go to both raise people up and then tear them down out of a devious pleasure.

The film includes interviews with some of the biggest entertainers including: Arsenio, Rob Zombie, Henry Winkler, Roseanne Barr and George Lucas. The film even includes rare and archival clips of President Reagan (of all people, being heckled) and even Barbra Streisand responding to a heckler at an '06 concert.

There is also a lot of comedy mixed in for good measure (I love the joke Ron Jeremy said that one critic once said he had an ugly penis.) The basic message of this film is that we all have a responsibility; be it at a concert, a sporting event, a comedy show or in the anonymous world of the Internet (where it seems that the claws are sharpening just as fast as the axes are grinding), and that is to show respect to others. Because words can hurt.

Included are some fascinating and informative interviews with some of comedies best men, including: Andrew 'Dice' Clay, Tom Green, Paul Rodriguez, a very unabashed and rather prolific Louie Anderson, and Jon Lovitz. I also especially enjoyed Carrot Top (the reigning poster boy for the hecklee). Carrot Top was able to provide a real prospective on what it's like to be drug through the trenches for years on end, for no other reason than viciousness. To me, someone like Carrot Top, (like Jamie Kennedy) is a true survivor because he's able to let his talent stand alone without letting the haters/hecklers/critics/bloggers/reviewers affect his art adversely.

""Heckler"" is for anyone who enjoys comedy or true-to-life films that have an extraordinarily comprehensive message. Right now the film is in rotation on Showtime (good luck trying to find anything halfway decent on Home Box), but you may just want to pick up the DVD since it's priced so low (and well worth it).

I never realized how sensitive Jamie Kennedy is; it must have taken a lot of courage to show this side of himself because I am sure there are some haters out there looking to sink their fangs into anything he does (no matter how artistic and creative it is). Jamie even interviews some ""professional critics"" who have gone out of their ways to bring him down. It was fascinating because all he wanted to know was ""why"" do they do it? We don't get an answer, but sometimes we really don't need an answer to a question to find the cause (envy, jealousy, resentment and self-loathing all have the loudest ring of truth). It was also fascinating watching Jamie speak to some of his other ""commentators"" (those hateful people who spew vitriol over the Internet); trying to find out why they have so much rage, and perhaps not surprisingly, none of them could articulate himself to the point of comprehension. It was like watching a doped-up deer caught in the headlights of a stretch limo.

The film is loaded with personal stories from comedians who share their experiences about being heckled or receiving reviews that tear them apart.

I have always found it interesting how emotional some people get even when reviewing on Ammie! It's only an opinion folks and this stuff should not be taken seriously. Most reviewers on this site have your best interest in mind and are only trying to help you find the right products. Of course there are always a few who want to spoil everyone else's fun and leave nasty comments on reviews just because the review disagrees with that person! I feel sorry for these people that their lives are so bad, they find it necessary to ruin it for everyone else.

It is about criticism and unintended  cruelity and intentional cruelity in the relationship between Hollywood and movie critics but it is much more. Its message speaks to all, on many levels, about the golden rule, and our social interactions but Heckler is in no way heavy handed or preachy.

3402115,4,B0017600EW,"If I were ever provoked to write reviews about Jamie Kennedy's widely criticized work in film (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Mask/dp/B00080ZFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Mask</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malibu-s-Most-Wanted/dp/B0000AGQ6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malibu's Most Wanted</a>) I'm really not sure I would've been so hateful and intentionally provocative.  Maybe that is what separates a guy like me, who writes as a hobby and simply because I love movies, from guys who write to make their employers money and get attention.  That however does not excuse the fact that his films are solid examples of how to make a movie that the mainstream will most likely ridicule.

Heckler is Kennedy's reaction to his own failures and the backlash that he has suffered for finding a niche in entertainment just large enough to afford him the opportunity to capitalize further on his fame. That isn't to say Kennedy deserves to be attacked as a person.  Heckler covers three groups of hecklers and interviews moderately famous comedians that all react to the dynamic of public criticism.  The first group is the classic comedy heckler, which is the least controversial simply because most of the time the average person will find themselves rooting against the heckler who is ruining a live stand-up routine.  The second group is the film critic, and that segment shows examples of film critics perhaps going a bit too far and taking their reviews into very personally insulting territory.  The third segment covers internet criticism, which in my humble view can be a most vile domain for hatred and dishonesty.  Kennedy goes from scene to scene in a very self-deprecating way and in the end I found myself actually laughing right along.  There is some irony there of course, as I only finally find Kennedy's strengths as he attempts to direct fire at those who criticize almost every other move he has made throughout his career.

The moments with celebrity personalities range from genuinely eye-opening and fresh, to incredibly blunt and humorous, and finally to shockingly egotistical and hypocritical; even for Hollywood.  One scene has Kennedy with fellow heckler target and prop-comedian Carrot Top.  Kennedy reads something to Carrot Top about his film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chairman-of-the-Board/dp/1573623989/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chairman of the Board</a>.  The blurb is insulting and personal and Kennedy, both frustrated and empathetic, asks Carrot Top how he should respond to someone like that.  Carrot Top simply says that he would ask them to come see his show.  I was actually impressed because I then realized that Carrot Top does his thing and people go and pay to see him, for better or worse.  On the other hand, celebrities like Bill Mahr and Roseanne coming out to attack critics as unqualified or untalented ego-maniacs, and voicing their opposition with rage and personal attacks was so transparently hypocritical that I had to think Kennedy and the others behind the scenes were playing both sides.  Nevertheless, this is a very entertaining film about a surprisingly interesting topic.  I definitely recommend it.",1239580800,2,3321,5.7566462167689165
3402116,5,B0017600EW,"I have only a fleeting knowledge of Jamie Kennedy's films, and this review of Heckler is based solely on that film's content. Apparently, there is something about Kennedy that inspires outrage in an audience that is simultaneously attracted to his comedy, yet bitterly resentful of his success. Some of these detractors are marginally in the public eye and devote way too much effort and time to heaping criticism on something they allegedly care so little about.

The subject of Heckler goes way beyond the experiences of Jamie Kennedy and shows endless samples of moronic audience behavior leveled at other entertainers. The examples cover a broad range, but some are no more than playground obscenity with no real commentary offered. To balance it all out, however, we're even treated to the sight of a guitar-playing comic who went out of control and bashed a heckler over the head with his instrument. (God only knows how much he had endured before he was driven to that lapse in judgement.)

But it's always the attacks against Kennedy that are the most fascinating. Watching him read some of these viscous ""reviews"" out loud to their authors was fabulous. Their floundering efforts to justify gross personal insults were laughable and adolescent. However, in another case the intense smirking of a relentlessly insulting ""critic"" was disturbingly flirtatious and, frankly, nauseating. Mr. Kennedy is obviously a man with tremendous self-control. A lesser man would have knocked him out of his chair.

Mere hecklers shout out whatever they can to instantly take attention away from the performer and put it on themselves. Are so-called professional ""critics"" any different from hecklers? In an era of sound bites, critical analysis with real content has been replaced by the clever quip with the potential to destroy the prospects of a project that took years to complete.

Heckler is tremendously thought-provoking and provided real insight into the world of performers subject to this abuse. Don't miss it!",1239580800,,2014,5.187692307692307
3402117,5,B0017600EW,"I really never thought I'd say this about a Jamie Kennedy film, but this one is superb.  I admit I've never been a big fan of Kennedy (although he did make me laugh sometimes on THE JAMIE KENNEDY EXPERIMENT), but after seeing this, I have a whole new respect for him.

I related to some of the people in HECKLER, having been the victim of criticism myself.  The movie isn't just about ""hecklers,"" but about how cruel people can be, which is a topic I've wondered about often; why are we so cruel to people we don't even know?  I question it most when a person isn't known at all, but even I've said mean things about famous people.  I guess it's because you can be more honest in terms of criticism (whether it's of a performance or just how someone looks) when you don't have to take a person's feelings into account.  It feels freer.  But that doesn't make it right.

Some of my favorite comics, actors, and others speak in this film.  Even the people I didn't know or like, though, made me listen.  I know how it feels to be hurt and criticized, and yes, you have to expect it, especially if you get into show business, but I'm glad Kennedy made this film.  Entertainers, filmmakers, comics, and actors all have feelings, too.  And some of them have great zingers to heckler's noise.

I do wish there had been more female comics (or other entertainers), but I was glad to see Maria Bamford and Jewel among the ladies who appeared.

HECKLER is one of the better ways I've spent an hour and a half, and it's nice to not wish I could get the time back after watching a film.  That happens too often these days.  I have to say, Jamie Kennedy impressed me and I'll be more open to his work in the future.",1238976000,,1702,4.30503144654088

Jamie has done a great job on this film, I can highly suggest that you buy it, watch it, as it was really worth the time, and then some.  The number of performers in this is amazing too.  It was presented very well, edited very well, and took us on a great ride through the performer's world of emotions.

First off, I am not a J.K. fan nor a detractor.  As far as I'm concerned he has not ruined a movie for me.  Nor has he made a movie great for me.  Though he was one of the best parts of Scream.  And though THE WRITERS ruined his charachter in the later movies by milking it, that was not his fault.  And he was still good.  The other movies I have seen him in were hit or miss for me.  Either way, nobody deserves reviews like he has gotten.

That being said, a heckler is far more unwanted than anything he has given us.  I have never seen his stand-up, but my guess is that he didn't make it this far if some of it wasn't entertaining.

Now as for this movie, it's a great commentary on what it's like to be criticized negatively and how it affects people.  It seems the world forgets these are still people with feelings.  I think people review based on personal feeling towards a person too often (Tom Cruise deserves that), but for the most part that's not fair.  This points out the faults of these reviews and the characters that write them.

This was a good documentary.  It never showed Jamie Kennedy being hilarious and then said ""See, I'm funny.""  It showed just who he is and what he did and then what people said about him.  Then asked you to decide what is right to do.

I'm not sure I've seen a Jamie Kennedy performance, so far.  It appears that a lot of heckler/critics take issue with him, the films he's been in, and/or his performances.  This film, in my opinion, was nuanced, thought provoking, and interesting.

By  nuanced, I mean that this was not some one sided hate, or love, manifesto on the heckler/critic.  I wouldn't say that they are viewed in an entirely  neutral way, through watching this, but the point is made more than once, that there have (and may still), exist critics, who have the ability to rate things in a constructive, insightful and meaningful way.  Too often, a review is just a puffed up piece of ""You suck.""

By thought provoking, I think that it is an ongoing struggle for artists of all types, to continue to make things, despite the relentless negative opinions that abound.  Van Gogh was not appreciated when he was alive.  Can you imagine if he was trying to create, whilst struggling in poverty, with mental health issues, these days?

The 365 and 24/7 of the current world, along with the internet, has a yin/yang effect on life.  The ability to discover amazing and brilliant things is an amazing gift, but the shadow realm of this, is that trolls and their websites, get to wreak havoc on both individuals, as well those in the public eye.  I found it interesting, when the why of such, along with critics and hecklers, was posed, along with what one could (or would like), to do about them.
