201158,3,160529893X,"I like this DVD. It has enough variety to be interesting, but it's not face-paced, so if you want a workout that will get your heart really pumping and have you sweating, this is not for you.  I think it's a good workout for someone between the ages of 40-60 - one that you can do every night.",1233619200,19,293,4.051724137931035
201159,5,160529893X,This is a great workout for someone who doesn't like to workout.  I am 64 years old and don't get out and walk as I should.  I pop this CD in my recorder and off I go in the safty of my livingroom.,1381708800,,197,3.558139534883721
201160,5,160529893X,"Got this for my wife and she said ""Easy pace but works up a good sweat and elevates heart rate.  She is so easy to follow"".",1377734400,,123,3.730769230769231
201161,5,160529893X,"If your answer is Yes, then this workout is for you.  I have several Ellen Barrett workout DVDs and I am glad I added this one to my collection.  Her instructions are precise, the music is great, and she doesn't try to oversell the ""Flat Belly"" diet.  I love the ""Stop and Tone"" and ab workout.  Every time I workout to this DVD I am always sweating at the end.  A really good buy to add to your workout collections.",1372118400,3,416,4.15
201162,4,160529893X,Anything Ellen Barrett does is great.  This was is intermediate and perfect for me.  Good to use when the weather not good outside and you still want to exercise.,1367280000,2,162,4.551724137931035
201163,3,160529893X,"This DVD is perfect for beginners that want to ease their way into exercise.  Ellen Barrett is excellent (as she always is).  I was hoping for a little more of a challenge.  I gave the DVD to my 62 year old Mom and she loves it, its perfect for her.",1366934400,,249,3.94
201164,4,160529893X,I love the instructor she is easy to follow. I am 51 and this workout pushes me to my limits but yet is is low impact.,1365033600,,118,3.576923076923077
201165,5,160529893X,Awesome video!  Enjoying it very much.  It is something you can do everyday or when you can't make it to the gym.  Thanks.,1363737600,,122,4.217391304347826
201166,5,160529893X,I enjoy the free support I get from Spark People for diet and exercise and the people that work there.  Ellen Barrett does a great job of having exercises that can be done by those that are aging.,1363737600,,196,4.157894736842105
201167,5,160529893X,I bought this DVD because during the winter months I do not go out for walks as much I have purchased many of Ellen Barrett work out DVDs she has excellent queues and has a bit of a ballet & yoga flare to her workouts. This DVD flat belly workout is a bit different from the others she has an effective work out on this walk with many other exercises added to the walk I love it.,1360454400,,379,3.935064935064935
201168,5,160529893X,"This workout was easy enough for me as a beginner (granted, I would have to go at my own pace & maybe skip a few moves) and challenging enough for me as an intermediate.  I sweat every time I do it!",1359417600,,198,3.8292682926829267
201169,5,160529893X,"This is such an easy workout to follow. Alternatives are given to accommodate many different levels of fitness. If you can walk, you could start the routines today.",1357689600,2,164,4.892857142857143
201170,5,160529893X,I really liked this walking DVD. It was fun. It had a couple of moments during the last set I got bored but all in all it really worked your body.,1353110400,,146,3.7419354838709675
201171,3,160529893X,"this one I could only do once. It seems kinda boring.....the moves are repeatful and it doesn't provide enough of a challenge. The woman is fun though, very upbeat and encouraging. I wouldn't buy it.",1350086400,,199,4.714285714285714
201172,5,160529893X,"This is a great exercise program.  I've been loosing 2#/week using it. Not all the fat is coming off my belly, but then that's what you pay for putting it on!
At least it IS coming off, and I'm feeling so much better lighter.

It's fun and easy.",1334880000,,245,4.083333333333333
201173,5,160529893X,"Easy to follow workout that does flatten your belly and encourages weight loss. I'm hooked. It's quite a thorough workout if you're not in such great shape, like me, but by sticking with it, I've really tightened up my mid-section.",1324598400,,231,4.8
201174,2,160529893X,"I work out seven days a week, alternating between intense cardio/strength regimens (Prevention, The Firm, Jillian Michaels) and the lower impact walking workouts of Leslie Sansone. So you could say I'm an intermediate to advanced level ""exerciser.""

I bought this DVD wanting a break from Ms. Sansone. And although the hostess here serves as a nice alternative to the shrill, ""You betcha!""-ness of Leslie, I didn't find the exercises to be as effective as Sansone's workouts, particularly the 12-minute mile activities.

I did like the ""Stop and Tone"" segments, all of which left me breathless and break up the monotony of the walking better than Sansone's ""knees,"" sidesteps and ""kicks."" But there's a combo in the latter half of the program that just lets all the steam out of the workout. She has you walking and, eventually, ""shuffling"" in a rectangle (you'll need a LOT of space for this) all while doing various low-impact arm movements. You go front to back, side to side for quite a while. But every time I do this portion of the workout, I find that whatever sweat I had just dries right up. Plus, they're playing this really intense music while you're essentially doing the hokey pokey. It was odd.

After the main workout, which is about 32 minutes with warm-up included, you can stop and cool down or move on to an eight minute belly workout, which is basically just ab work on the floor. I thought that was good, too, and found it quite easy thanks to my experience with Jillian Michaels' DVDs.

In all, I would say if you're new to exercise (and particularly if you're obese) I would start with Leslie Sansone and leave this DVD until about a month or two in for something more varied. But, if you're experienced like me, just leave it alone.",1320364800,27,1756,4.710097719869707
201175,4,160529893X,"I've been doing the flat belly diet for some time and I was excited to find that they had workouts to accompany the eating plan, so I got this one and the other one (Express Belly Blast)to try out. This one (Walk off Belly Fat) consists of 25 minutes of intervals- you do a walking series and then you ""stop and tone"" in between the sets of walking. At the end you do about 8 minutes of ab work and then there is a cool down at the end. I think this video is pretty effective, it didn't get my heart pumping as much as the other one though and I have 2 left feet, so I found the walking footwork a challenge at first, but now that I've done it several times I have it down. I would say this workout is good for beginners through intermediate exercisers. Advanced exercisers would be bored with this workout. I really enjoy the instructor, Ellen Barrett, she cues really well and is energetic and motivating without being irritating. I also enjoy that there are modifications to most of the exercises that are demonstrated by one of the background girls in the video. Overall I think this is a good workout, it just isn't as good as the other one in this series, so that's why I only give it 4 stars.",1312416000,5,1199,4.240174672489083
201176,5,160529893X,"I really like this workout dvd.  Ellen Barrett is a good leader, the workout is easy to follow and effective - you will sweat.  There is variety and the interval training works the best for me.",1301097600,4,193,4.333333333333333
201177,2,160529893X,"I bought this DVD to add variety to my regular workouts.  I do at least 6 mies per day and love  walking as it is effective and easy on my joints.  The title of this DVD is certainly intriguing and who does not want a flat belly?  I realize it is connected to a book and diet, both of which I have read and think just using common sense and eating healthy will accomplish the same thing.  However, back to the DVD.  It was easy to do, but I found it somewhat irritating.  It seems just as you get going you have to stop and do intervals of specific ""belly"" exercises.  I would have preferred to continue with the aerobic portion, then do the other targeted exercises.  It was pretty short too so I did it twice...twice the irritation.",1295568000,9,734,4.223021582733813
201178,5,160529893X,I heard about this DVD as I am currently doing the Flat Belly Diet. The Walk Off Belly Fat workout is not too challenging but you can feel yourself getting a decent work out at the same time. Ellen Barrett is an instructor I had not heard of - apparently more well known in the USA than anywhere else but I find her easy to watch and can follow her instructions. She's not vague or overly pushy as some instructors can be. She breaks down each exercise and then explains what that exercise is doing... Thoroughly recommend to anyone new to exercise programs or even for those looking for that easier program to do on days when you're muscles are already hurting from a big workout the day before.,1295049600,8,696,4.403100775193798
201179,5,160529893X,I love the variety and the different exercise levels included in this dvd. The pace is quick and  Ellen is a good instructor.,1286150400,6,125,4.434782608695652
201180,5,160529893X,"I have used lots of tapes (started with casette tapes way back when), CDs, and DVDs for exercising.  This one is nicely paced, contains additional information should you want it and acceptable music.  It's a nice accompaniment to the book which I have also.  Lost nine pounds and still going!",1279670400,27,292,4.8
201181,4,160529893X,"This is an enjoyable walking workout that combines standing core work. The low impact walking choreography is simple to follow and the instructor does a great job of explaining each move in advance. Even though this is a walking workout, there are enough different moves to keep you from getting bored. This DVD is for everyone - there isn't anything jarring or high impact that could hurt any injuries.

Workouts: There is a warmup, 25 minute walking routine with ""Stop and Tone"" segments that target the core, an 8 minute ab/core floor routine and a cool down.

Setting: The set is a large, open workout studio with hard wood floors.

Music: Instrumental background music. If exciting music is your thing, this is not it; however you can do this DVD many times and not get tired of the music.

Crew: There are 2 women working out with Ellen. One person shows easier modifications and one shows more challenging modifications.

Equipment Needed: No equipment needed for the walking workout - just a little space in front of your TV. I use a yoga mat when doing the floor work, but it really depends on the surface of your workout space.

Instructor: Ellen Barrett is pleasant and encouraging. Her cueing is excellent.",1278115200,78,1218,4.776190476190476
201182,4,160529893X,I really enjoy all of Ellen Barrett's workouts.  This is an enjoyable walking workout that has some added moves in addition to the walking to keep the interest up and add to the abdominal workout.,1277164800,16,196,4.6
201183,5,160529893X,I really like this DVD. it's a 45 minute workout and very easy to follow.,1276560000,7,73,3.933333333333333
201184,5,160529893X,This product is really suited to mature women.  It's not too strenuous or energetic.  Just about anybody can do it and it really works.  I'm on my way to a flat belly!,1273363200,12,167,4.15625
201185,5,160529893X,"I purchased this DVD for variety in my workouts. Ellen does a great job with the walking and core work. Not a good one for beginners, but those who have been exercising for a while and just want a good walking workout, this one is good.",1268524800,4,236,4.1521739130434785
201186,4,160529893X,Walking & (standing) toning intervals.  Nice change from Leslie.  Ellen Barrett is fun & creative.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars - the music is not very good.,1265328000,3,169,4.387096774193548
201187,5,160529893X,"I bought this Flat Belly Workout dvd to help me lose some weight or at least to keep from gaining some over the winter since I can't get out and walk now..I am a novice at this work out stuff and found that I could actually ""do"" this workout, and not kill myself..I worked up a sweat and feel it was beneficial, and feel anyone who is new to working out or has health issues could use this workout. I am pleased to have it.. I am ordering one of the more stringent workouts since I've worked myself up to a more strenuous routine..I would recommend this for a novice to start a workout program..It's not for the advanced buffs..",1265328000,4,628,4.241666666666666
201188,3,160529893X,"This is an okay workout and a nice change of pace. This instructor is not quite as stiff as Freytag, but still a bit too bouncy with her unnatural walking moves. The bonus workout at the end is worth the purchase on it's own. You should be able to complete the 8 minute toning on your first try and really feel the results. The walk workout crosses the line and has just a few too many fancy dance steps, but if you can get through that five minutes, it's worth the effort. This is the first Prevention workout that I have purchased that is actually worth keeping in my collection.",1237075200,19,581,4.290909090909091
