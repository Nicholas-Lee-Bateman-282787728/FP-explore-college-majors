1369436,5,B00004XPOH,Our four year old daughter loves this story! Although she has viewed it several times she still asks for it first during our designated childrens viewing evenings. This film teaches the importance of individual  responsibility. A princess is really more than a crown. Action speaks more  than words. A young lady is expected to be more than an ordinary kid. The  reward is two fold in that she will be respected by all who know her. We  are looking forward to more videos based on the Jewel Kingdom books! We now  have ten in our library.,946425600,3,538,4.5625
7926296,5,B00004XPOH,"I ordered this with my brother and sister one afternoon as we were feeling nostalgic. This product arrived promptly, was well-packaged and functioned well! The film itself is great, I still get some of the songs stuck in my head.",1481932800,,229,4.75
7926297,5,B00004XPOH,"This was a favorite at my house growing up. Between the odd costumes, hilariously clunky puppet-like characters, and the dialogue that's just slightly off in some way, this is a winner for cheeky nostalgia.",1480464000,,206,5.088235294117647
7926298,4,B00004XPOH,It was great and worked fine. I was little and loved it butits ddifferent now being older. Still enjoyed it and now passing it on to my baby sister.,1371600000,,148,4.137931034482759
7926299,5,B00004XPOH,DVD came as advertized. Our grandchildren love the story. Thanks for delivering as advertized and on time. We're quite pleased.,1368057600,,127,5.4
7926300,1,B00004XPOH,"I'm 21 years old.  Why oh why did I ever watch this as a kid.  Sometimes I really question the sanity of my childish brain.  I am in utter shock as to how I ever enjoyed it.  Sure I can understand what the movie is trying to teach about friendship, family, courage and loyalty but still.  I'm gonna have nightmares for a week now.  Thank god I couldn't find this anywhere online to watch, though I was really only looking for the Darklings' song when Roxanne gets captured by them.  This movie probably could've worked better too if they hadn't made it into a stinking musical.  Why must they always do that with books?  Yes it's cute after awhile, but honestly it just gets old and boring.  This movie is just one of many many movies that I've seen fail in this department.  I know I know, I'm an adult now, but still.  They practically butchered the book(s).  But I guess because I was a kid I didn't have a clue as to why this movie is so terrible.  That's how it is with younglings.  You can go ahead and buy this if you really want to, but really?  A VHS?  If you're going to get it I suggest at least waiting to find out if they're ever going to put it on DVD.  Though it unfortunately seems likely because it did not do that well from what I remember when it first came out.  Oh well.  Spend if you must, it's your money after all.",1335830400,,1338,4.15234375
7926301,2,B00004XPOH,"I was deeply disappointed in this video especially because all the other reviews were 5 stars.  The acting and make-up left alot to be desired.  The Ruby Princess sang well, but others in the cast did not.  My husband left the room because he found it so nauseating.  My 9 year old daughter seemed to enjoyed it, but fast forwarded through most of the musical numbers.  She said that the video did not give as much background on the story as she would have liked.  The story taught a good lesson and did not contain anything offensive or controversial, but I don't this makes up for the poor quality of the production.  In the future we'll stick to the books and let her imagination draw the pictures.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1016582400,,738,4.455223880597015
7926302,5,B00004XPOH,"My daughter is a longtime fan of the Jewel Kingdom books and I thought we'd try out the movie version of one of them. She absolutely loves it!!  I think it's definitely more for children than for adults as I found it a little tiring to watch over and over again, but if there's a child you know who loves this book series, grab this movie!",982540800,2,339,4.136363636363637
7926303,5,B00004XPOH,My daughter loved the video.  She has all twelve of the books in the series and couldn't wait to see the movie.  The values and lessons in the  story are just another way to re-enforce positive behavior.  I would buy  all of them if there were more!,968976000,3,249,4.212765957446808
7926304,5,B00004XPOH,"This video is so pure and delighful... my six  grandkids watched it 12 times this week-end and cried when they had to go home! My three 2 year old girls all wanted to put on their ""ballerina dresses"" and dance  around the room with the Ruby Princess! It has everything, except violence.  What a concept!",946944000,5,303,4.472727272727273
