8700665,2,B00T6XDGQM,"Blood Diner was one of those movies that was always visible at the local video store but I just never got around to seeing. The VHS cover always intrigued me.

 Anyway last night I saw it and really wished I hadn't. It was one of the worst 80's horror movies I've ever seen. The acting, the plot, the gore the lot. Oh well at least I've finally seen Blood Diner now.",1463702400,,366,4.140845070422535
