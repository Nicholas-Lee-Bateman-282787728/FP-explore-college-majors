4489055,3,B004WQKKJY,Ok movie. It was entertaing to watch but defenitely a B movie. The acting was not ver good especially the female lead but i didn't  rent the movie expecting more than I got.,1355097600,,173,4.242424242424242
4489056,2,B004WQKKJY,"The acting was horrendous and the story didn't make much sense.  Some of the parts had no relation to one another and seemed to be thrown in just to make the movie longer.  Also, there were critical mistakes made like the relationship the boxer had with his side piece, mid movie there was an obvious change to the side jawn like the viewer wouldn't notice that it was clearly a different person. The story and the characters were underdeveloped.",1352851200,2,446,4.632911392405063
4489057,1,B004WQKKJY,"This has to be the worst movie i ever saw, poorly acted ,horrible music ,and poor plot and character development.!!! a giant snooze fest.",1342051200,,137,4.75
4489058,4,B004WQKKJY,"I got this movie not knowing what to expect. It seemed like a low budget film which it is, but it's actually quite interesting.

The plot was a really good plot, although, certain characters should have been played by different actors/actresses.

There was a little comedy in the fight scene with the baby mama showing up to the cookout. Should have been a little longer.

The scene with the boxer and his secret boyfriend of 5 years was possibly the realest and best acting out of the whole movie. The guy who plays the boyfriend that's on the sideline is SUPER CUTE! He seemed natural at acting and his scenes should have been longer and his character should have been extended. Would love to see him do more movies.

But overall, the movie is good for what it's worth. It's better than alot of low budget crap out there. The message is really good.",1331769600,2,851,4.5064935064935066
4489059,2,B004WQKKJY,"From other reviews I thought it would be a good movie. They don't tell you the movie has sex, language, trashy, slutty. If you are a christian, you want to know these things, so you don't buy this trash and throw away your money.

I'm angry that reviewers don't tell the truth about movies and don't say that there is drugs, sex, sex scenes, foul language, some indecent scenes, too much violence. Then we can read their reviews and make a intelligent decision NOT TO BUY.

REVIEWERS... tell us the truth in your reviews so we can get a clear picture of whether the moview is decent enough to buy or not. If you are a christian, then tell us...you will not like this movie.  It has D, S, L V.",1315958400,4,692,4.267175572519084
4489060,3,B004WQKKJY,"This society judges people far to much, if people were not so homophobic movies like this would not have to be be made. I say watch the movie for the message.",1314403200,3,158,4.129032258064516
8445594,5,B004WQKKJY,"THE ACTORS COME OFF THE SCREEN REAL.  (''KEVIN'' REMINDS ME OF JAMIE FOXX) (THE LEADING LADY WAS LOVELY AND DID A 3.75 PT JOB.)
THE SCRIPT IS PRODUCED BY THE ACTORS AS MATURE BUT IT IS SHORT ON DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF THE LOW BUDGET, I guess.  BUT THIS STORY-LINE IS SURELY LIKED BY AUDIENCES AND WITH FULL-DEVELOPMENT IT COULD DO WELL AT THE BOX-OFFICE.  (NOTE:  I WATCHED ''''DE-LOVELY'''',THE COLE PORTER STORY, AFTER VIEWING THIS MOVIE AND IT HAS A SIMILAR THEME BUT WITH ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE: IT PAINTS A PICTURE THAT THE COUPLE ACTUALLY LOVED AND RESPECTED EACH OTHER.  THE WIFE HAD POWER IN THE RELATIONSHIP.  THE WIFE AGREED ON HIS SEXUAL DEFERENCE BECAUSE HE TOLD HER THE TRUTH AND HE WAS A MAJOR ARTIST.).....This question comes to mind:  Is the difference here ''''the depth of the story-line'''?  I venture to say: the Cole Porter Story has many versions but they always show a large amount of depth, development of the characters and paints a picture of the characters and the story.  *The depth in this story was.....?*  I won't say. That would be a spoiler.

  5-STARS BECAUSE I WAS HELD AND INTERESTED AND I WAS DRAWN TO THE ACTORS: I LIKED THEM, esp. KEVIN.  HE WAS SEXY AND LOVING.  ALL OF THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES DID A GOOD JOB..",1505520000,,1248,4.609090909090909

8445596,3,B004WQKKJY,"For what it's worth, the movie is ok.  For an independent film and a lower budget, I think they did a good job.  The storyline is great, the lines however could have used more work.  The actors were good.",1485043200,,204,4.17948717948718
