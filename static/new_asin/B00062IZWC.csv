2162571,5,B00062IZWC,"I just got this DVD and it is amazing! If you are a fingerpicker or a fan of country jazz fingerstyle guitar you will love this. There are not only footage of Merle playing 'Lost John', 'John Henry', Nine Pound Hammer' (my favorite),'Muskrat' and a very entertaining duet on 'Too Much Sugar For A Dime'(the combo is hot: guitar, standup bass, fiddle and Trumpet and Merle soloing flawlessly). It is evident that this project is a labor of love and that guitarist Marcel Dadi has spent lots of time perfecting the Travis Style of picking. He displays a detailed knowledge of Travis' style: the two-finger approach with the use of thumb in chording as opposed to bar chords. Marcel is a great teacher too! He explains the songs and plays them at regular speed then slow with split screen. He teaches songs such as Memphis Blues, Walking The Strings and of course 'Cannonball Rag' (this alone is worth the price of the DVD!). I learned this song note for note from this DVD as well as gained a new respect for Marcel Dadi as a guitarist and teacher and deepened my fascination and respect for Merle Travis! Buy this DVD! You will fall in love with the music of MT, and your feet won't stop tapping!",1192147200,10,1195,4.537037037037037

8037424,5,B00062IZWC,Marcel sure did make that Ovation sound great!,1449273600,,46,4.875
8037425,5,B00062IZWC,"I found this DVD really easy to work with even though it was well above my current level, but I am slowly improving and I found Marcel's low key reaching approach perfect. What a shame he died in the plane crash so young. I liked the new chords made by wrapping the thumb over the neck and found them easier than. Thought after some regular practice",1418860800,,349,4.303030303030303
8037426,2,B00062IZWC,"My order came without the 60-page booklet mentioned in the description. I'm not sure if this has happened to others ordering the item, and it seems like it hasn't, but it was a disappointment to me. Aside from that, Marcel Dadi is a great player and a great teacher with a nice French accent, but his accent and teaching style will get old if I have to rewind and try to work out the songs by ear.",1417392000,,397,4.1688311688311686
8037427,5,B00062IZWC,"Exactly what I was looking for, and as recommended by a good Travis style guitar man.  Happily, the DVD presumed the viewer already knows how to play guitar and quickly homed in on the peculiarities of Merle's style.  Now if I could only REMEMBER this stuff!",1398729600,,258,4.586956521739131
8037428,5,B00062IZWC,"I first got this instruction video in the early 2000s and it was good I got it before I tried any of the other material available, since it is still the best.

A few important things to point out though:

Marcel Dadi plays mostly the original arrangements of Travis, but he adds a some touches of his own that doesn't match the tablature. Dadi also sometimes uses other fingerings of the 'chords' than how Merle would have done. I think he points this out at one time in the video.

The tablature instead matches exactly how Merle played the tunes in specific recordings (I include those album titles at the end of the review).

He pays extra attention to most of the unique techniques Travis used and the video includes several complete ""Snader Transcriptions"" (short films) from the 1950s and the tabs for all of them but the ""Mus'Rat tune"", which is an easy tune 'if' you compare to the rest of the songs here.

The tune 'Walkin the Strings' uses a special intro roll, that Merle was interviewed about later in life:
 Here he actually used 'thumb and three fingers', but he said it was only used for specific tunes that required this like the above & 'Blue Smoke'... Otherwise, I can say that mostly any technique used only requires 'thumb and index' and practise.

A note on other videos and books on Travis' guitar style:
I think Thom Bresh's video and Tommy Flint's book are really good in their own right, but neither of them feels so complete as this video. Tommy Flint's lesson goes more into the different styles from Muhlenberg County, but doesn't go so much in depth on the Travis' technique.

  The Thom Bresh lesson gives much details on the style, but includes no specific version, instead it teaches many of Travis's techniques through the tunes. I can recommend that video for the reason that it teaches the style, not specific versions. Combine this with listening to the originals and your own arrangements will probably end up much different, although it will sound familiar.
 There is also numerous books on the style called ""Travis Picking"", but that term stands for a much more general description for playing tunes with an alternate bass & melody. Most of the elements from Merle's style is gone there, if the author doesn't specifically include a section on how Travis played.

That said, I think this Marcel Dadi lesson is the best way to start learning his style, but it is best to focus on a few or one tune at a time, because it is all too easy to get overloaded with details and then end up learning very slow indeed ...
(easier said than done).
--------------

Here follows where the Tab-versions were recorded:

Fuller Blues &
Cane Break Blues

...are from 'Walkin the Strings' album (first released in 1960, now on either 1 CD or on the Raven label 2-albums-1-CD)
(this one was recorded for Capitol Transcriptions in all-acoustic solo sessions, probably in 1947)  (the album cover was himself with his electric guitar)

Bluebell
Saturday Night Shuffle
Memphis Blues
Walkin' the Strings

...are from the 'Merle Travis Guitar' issued in 1955, electric guitar solos)  -the cover was in this case with an acoustic guitar.
(this was reissued on the above Raven '2-albums-1-CD. I think there also was an earlier single CD variant by another company.

Cannonball Rag

...is the version from his 'Strictly Guitar' album (1968) (mostly electric solos)
 He recorded this tune on several other occasions, among them the above 'Walkin the Strings' , Live Radio and TV.
 The tune was probably composed by Kennedy Jones (b 1900) who showed many to-be thumbpickers how to play, including Mose Rager & Ike Everly. According to interviews Merle Travis also visited Jones's home.",1389225600,2,3694,4.791798107255521
8037429,3,B00062IZWC,"This DVD lesson by the late great Marcel Dadi has a lot for it going. Marcel Dadi really nailed down the guitar style of Merle Travis. His arrangements of some of Travis' most famous hits are overall right on the spot. He presents a wealth of information on how to master the Travis style, from playing the rhythm with the heavy thumb to fingering the unorthodox chord shapes that Travis used.

There are, however, some technical flaws which need to be mentioned. The split-screen view of the right hand was filmed at a less than ideal angle, so it's hard to see what the index finger is doing on the melody. Stefan Grossman modified the right hand perspective in his later video/DVD productions, but that doesn't help us with this video. Another problem is that the tabs are fairly inaccurate. If you had trouble figuring out how to play a lick, don't count on the tabs, because most likely you won't find it there. It surprises me a little that Marcel Dadi didn't care about transcribing his split-screen versions more accurately; normally with Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop lessons, the tabs are supposed to be exact transcriptions of the split-screen versions. This is definitely not the case here.",1374537600,4,1206,4.826086956521739
8037430,5,B00062IZWC,"I knew this would be a great Merle Travis tutorial given that it was done by the legendary Marcel Dadi.  Marcel was a great picker - too soon gone and much missed.  I was afraid I would have trouble with his accent, but he spoke very clear English.  This video did not disappoint in quality.  The surprise though is int he value!  I thought I was getting 7 tunes, 3 of which I already learned from Thom Bresh's Homespun video.  However, not only does Marcel give a slightly different version of each (Travis never played the same way twice, so this is in true Travis tradition) but, in true Marcel tradition, he includes a tab of every tune on the video!  That means, not only do you get the rare footage of Travis playing 5 tunes (one with the great Eddie Kirk on rhythm, and you can learn a lot just by studying his great rhythm chord break - like like Eldond Shamblin used to use to punctuate all those great Bob Wills tunes) but you get the full tab - so, you really get 12 full tunes!  That makes this lesson the best value ever.",1349395200,,1034,4.239795918367347
8037431,5,B00062IZWC,"Marcel Dadi was a great guitar player and appeared to have mastered the Travis style of thumbpicking guitar.  Here he presents an collection of Merle Travis' hit songs.  I found the song selection to be excellent.  However, the beginner or intermediate student (and you get to pick where you are at), will find this dvd lesson to be a bit of a challenge.  The instructor assumes that the student already knows the basics of thumbpicking and has more than a passing familiarity with chord forms that are outside the norm for individuals who are used to country blues or ragtime blues or ragtime.  In addition, due to language issues the instruction at certain moments leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Despite this, the dvd gives you access to some beautiful guitar playing and exposure to a master of the thumbstyle genre.

If you are new to thumb picking - as opposed to fingerpicking country blues or even ragtime or ragtime blues - you would be better served to purchase Pat Kirtley's ""Introduction to Thumbstyle Guitar.""  If you are just starting out in learning acoustic guitar, Fred Sokolow has an introductory lesson for thumbstyle guitar that would provide an strong foundation on which to build on.

Once the basics are firmly under you, then Mr. Dadi's lesson will be much easier and a great place to add some variety to your repertoire.

Highly recommended...when your ready!

All three of these products can be found on Amazon and also from Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop.",1295049600,,1488,4.841897233201581
8037432,5,B00062IZWC,"Just got this video in a few days ago.  Marcel teaches Merle's instrumental pieces which consequently are the hardest ones to play.  I like this approach though because if you can master the tunes on this DVD you'll be an expert.  If you've never done any Travis picking before this DVD would not be a good place to start, however it would still be great to watch so you can get an idea of what's ahead.  I'd suggest a beginning Travis picking course first, Fred Sokolow has a good one.",1266537600,3,486,4.366666666666666
