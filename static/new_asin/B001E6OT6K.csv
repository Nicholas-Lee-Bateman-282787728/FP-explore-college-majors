3546470,3,B001E6OT6K,"I got this to test out my DTS HD 7.1 sound system and my new Panasonic DMP BD55 player (great -- from Amazon).  The packing looks like something you would buy on the street in Shanghai.  The paperwork liner is sketchy and cheap.  What intrigues me is the phrase (which IS included in the Amazon ad info -- and I missed): ""PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS RECORD WAS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED FOR 5.1 AND PRESENTED FOR 7.1 SURROUND SOUND REPRODUCTION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH UNIQUE ACOUSTIC REALITY EXPERIENCE.""  The music is fine and it drives all 7 speakers and subwoofer but I have a feeling this is an ""upconverted/remastered"" recording.  I also got the similarly packaged and documented Mozart ""DTS-HD Master Audio Disk"" recording for a total of $45. Is there any ""native mastered DTS-HD"" (my terminology) available?  Three stars because I am suspicious.",1231459200,6,837,4.859154929577465

This HDDVD is a mere slideshow with the classic masterpiece accompanying. If I wanted this, I would buy a dvd-A. I was also annoyed by the fact that they are mentioning that the visual os 1080p. High definition my a_s.
Amazon should stop selling this crooky product. Thanks/John.",1208908800,3,329,5.111111111111111
3546472,1,B001E6OT6K,"With a proliferation of Vivaldi Four Seasons recordings in CD, SACD and DVD-Audio formats, this HD-DVD should have been the standout item in ones collection that is already brimming with multiple versions of the same. With the cover offering a tantilising glimpse of the orchestra, I bought this on the premise that it would be a video of the concert performance. I am most unhappy that this is not the case. The scenery slideshow is pretty enough but like most people who will buy this disc based on what is on the cover, they will be disappointed.",1205712000,6,549,4.670103092783505
3546473,3,B001E6OT6K,"I purchased this title in the hopes of seeing a live symphony orchestra playing the ""Four Seasons"". What I got instead was a slide show. If the visuals were actual film of the countryside subjects presented it might have been pretty good. However the images are static and not very involving. The music one the other hand is quite good. The soundtrack is in surrond (they used a double orchestras) and it does a good job of giving a sense of being at the performance. Too bad the visuals don't match up with the music.",1205280000,5,518,4.463157894736842
3546474,1,B001E6OT6K,"LG BD390 would not produce any sound from this disc even with the latest firmware 529B. I tried PCM stereo, PCM multi-ch, Recode to DTS and Primary pass through, no luck. The disc was recognized and played as AVCHD with 1 DTSMA audio stream and 1 blank video stream. On my desktop, the disc could only be read from my BD-ROM, not my DVD-ROM, so I guess it is indeed blu-ray media. The extracted audio stream is about 5GB, even smaller than the size of a DVD-9.

Maybe the disc will play in your blu-ray player, but my LG BD390 can't. Also I don't see the point using blu-ray media because everything on the disc can be authorized in AVCHD format, fitting on a normal DVD.

Recently I've bought the BluRay media Vivaldi The Four Seasons Concert for double orchestra.

It is not playing in the BD-P1600, but it is playing in my playstation 3.
It is supposed to play in backward compatible 5.1 DTS system exactly as the playstation 3 does.

I have sent a suggestion to the Samsung development team to make a compatible firmware version.
I'm waiting the answer from Samsung.

3546478,5,B001E6OT6K,"This disk still has to be one of the best sounding recordings of this piece ever. I'm certainly not a music critic, so I'll simply say that this performance is the most disciplined yet passionate I've ever heard. What particularly impresses me is the 7.1 engineering. The clarity and balance is incredibile. In other recordings I've heard, the harpsicord sounds like it's buried under a quilt. Here it is perfectly articulated. The bass is full yet never boomy and the strings are crisp but never raspy. It doesn't get any better than this.",1244332800,4,540,4.817204301075269

3546480,1,B001E6OT6K,"I bought three of this company's Blu-rays ... save your money and get the CD. Better yet, get an SACD version for real high-quality sound. I have ""Tchaikovsky Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 3,"" ""Bach Orchestral Suites No. 1, 2 & 3,"" and ""Vivaldi Four Seasons"" in these discs. None will play in my Samsung Blu-ray player with the latest firmware. All play in my Panasonic. The sound quality is no better than standard quality 5.1 surround; in fact, I suspect they just copied the material from a standard 5.1 version. There's very little sound in the rear channels and virtually no separation. Sounds like stereo. Save your money, these are a rip-off.",1238025600,15,644,4.707964601769912
3546481,4,B001E6OT6K,"I purchased this disc to give my new 7.1 receiver a test run, as I had no other 7.1 source material.  Unfortunately, it did not play on my PS3.  I was using the latest firmware, rechecked other blu-ray discs, DVD's, SACD's and all worked flawlessly except for this disc.  I decided to have Amazon exchange the disc to give it a second try.  I'm glad I did.  The second disc worked perfectly.  The PS3 recognizes the DTS-HD and all seven of the speaker indicators light up on my Pioneer receiver.  As someone else commented regarding this recording vs. SACD, I would have to agree. While there is definite separation between the right-front, left-front, center, right-surround and left-surround; the rear channel does not seem to have much distinction from the right and left surround.  It is still an excellent recording, and worth the price, I just don't know that it is worth an extra $4-5 over the SACD price.",1235001600,3,912,4.727848101265823

8296721,1,B001E6OT6K,"The other reviews mentioned some of the technical problems of this production, I will focus on the sound only.

Even though this product is sold as 7.1 (which technically is true), the producer mentions in an online forum, that it is actually an 5.1 to 7.1 upmix. Several other reviewers also repeat that.
But even this is not quite true.

On the disk there are indeed 8 Channels per Track, but the real problem is, that these channels were not separately recorded. Not only is the 7.1 production an 5.1 upmix, but the original 5.1 production (should it be the source for this upmix) is in fact an 2.0 (stereo) upmix.
The source material appears to be a 2.0 mix in 96 bit and 24 kHz, so the quality is solid and above your average CD production. However, claiming that this is surround in any way is clearly untrue.

Center: the Center Channel appears to be a mix of both, the left and the right stereo channels. It does not carry any additional or any less information, so if you play the Center alone, you can hear the full piece. The loudness however has been slightly reduced.

Rear Channels: The rear channels are also stereo, but clearly derived from the main stereo tracks. Neither of them carries any less or more information than the main stereo track. Here too, the loudness has been reduced (even more so than for the Center).

Side Channels: The side channels are stereo as well, but 100% identical to the rear channels. They are completely redundant and therefore unnecessary.

LFE: The LFE (aka sub-woofer) channel is poorly produced as it carries way to much information. It appears to be derived from the stereo channels as well. Even though its loudness has been reduced and some heights seem to be removed, you can clearly hear most of the instrumentation including violins and even high notes if you play it on normal speakers. A proper sub-pass-filter will probably remove most of it, however this clearly shows how bad this production is.

So you don't have to take my word for it, I attached a waveform diagram in the pictures section (sorry, Amazon wouldn't let me attach a full sized one, but all tracks and all parts of all tracks show the same production method).

Conclusion:
This is not a 7.1 production, nor is it a 5.1 production - it is not even an surround production at all. This is a stereo CD which has been upmixed - your bluray player or computer can easily do this itself, there is no reason to pay the huge premium for it.
Do yourself a favor and get a proper CD or SACD. Cheaper, works everywhere and sounds the same.",1329091200,4,2557,4.555555555555555
