5254025,4,B00938UVC2,"John Connor is a loose cannon.  He has a very volatile personality, but also possesses exceptional survival skills and a willingness to act when others would simply look the other way.  Christian Bale screws things up once again, looking like a super soldier-type character, tearing through each scene without the indecisiveness and fear that defined earlier Connor characters.  Not to say that his ridiculous performance drags this collection down; it just makes me wonder how he continues to find work, much less be given the feature role in a big release time and time again!  Of course when the director has a name more conducive to that of a chat room/message board moderator bot, the results aren't going to be pretty.  Terminator 2 is the highlight here.  Featuring unrivaled fidelity in picture and sound, all 3 versions of the film are included.  Plus, all the extra behind the scenes shorts and featurettes from the Ultimate Edition DVD are present, as well.  Anyone who remembers the Ultimate Edition from way back knows that there was an insane amount of content-probably the most of any DVD to date!

The Terminator is a standard up-convert, with a few deleted scenes, etc, etc.  Terminator 3 is what it is:  all the usual extra stuff, with the best possible definition in both video and sound.  It's important to note that while this is the definitive collection in HD, the fair market value of these movies should not be forgotten.  Always the thrifty shopper, I would advise to not over-spend on this.  I got an exceptional deal elsewhere, sweetening the cyborg-infested, pre- and post-apocalyptic, emotionally-charged, cocking the Model 1887 with one hand pot even furthur!",1359849600,5,1690,5.010752688172043

Being a HUGE Terminator fan, when I saw this I simply could not pass it up! Of course T2: Judgement Day will always be my favorite and is a true classic, but ALL 4 Films are very entertaining and thrilling! I was impressed with McG's take on the series with ""Terminator Salvation"". Well done!

I honestly hope that they don't make anymore movies because it's a wonderful series but the main story has been exhausted at this point! This excellent collection is a fine way to say farwell to the story of John Connor!

5254034,4,B00938UVC2,"Something I've heard people ask is why the ""Terminator"" movies haven't been released in a box set all together. The answer used to be simple: they were owned by separate studios. No longer will I have to throw that disappointing answer out at disgruntled fans. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment has taken possession of and released the 5-Disc collection ""The Terminator Anthology"" on Blu-ray.

""The Terminator Anthology"" is everything an enthusiast of the franchise could ever want. You get the original classic in high-definition, the special edition and theatrical versions of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" and ""Terminator Salvation's"" director's cut and theatrical version. They're all presented in stunning high-definition transfers that make you feel like you're seeing the movies for the first time all over again.

I enjoy all the films with Arnold Schwarzenegger about the same. In retrospect, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a bit tedious at points and seems overlong and bloated. People couldn't get enough of ""Liquid Metal Man"" when the movie came out, so I can see how 137 minutes of different appearances by him kept an audience alert in 1991. It doesn't hold the same dazzle today that it did 21 years ago.

""Terminator Salvation"" is an entertaining movie even without Schwarzenegger's presence throughout. You have Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Anton Yelchin adding star power to it. The surprise appearance of Arnie's CGI face gave fans something to smile nostalgically about.

There are plenty of special features for consumers to be excited about. They include deleted scenes, ""Making of"" and ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, audio commentaries, and ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" contains an introduction by Arnold Schwarzenegger and a gag reel. Maximum Movie Mode for ""Terminator Salvation"" provides storyboard comparisons and a Terminator Mythology Timeline. Not to sound like a car salesman, but that's not all!

""The Terminator Anthology"" Blu-ray collection comes housed in a cardboard sleeve which features the metallic face of a T-800 peeking out from behind a ""T"" on the cover. The movies are on four different discs. The fifth disc features the special features for ""Terminator Salvation."" This is the ideal way for consumers to get these classic films in one handy set. For many fanatics, it's a dream finally realized thanks to Warner Bros.",1348099200,171,2439,5.324675324675325

But I would also like to explain why Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation do not match The Terminator and T2; this is because, The Terminator was previously distributed by MGM and T2 by Lionsgate, while Terminator 3 and Salvation by Warner Bros. Which distributes this box set. Therefore, the first and second films discs had to be created specifically for this box set. Never before has a complete collection been released of the fanschiae because so many distributors held rights to each film. We should be grateful that not two but THREE studios came together to release all four films in one box set. Also, regarding the Terminator 3 disc; yes, the movie starts right away without any previews or a menu. And no, you cannot get to the menu while the film is playing. BUT, there IS in fact a menu AND special features. You're taken to the menu after the film is over, and there is actually quite a decent amount of special features, they're all listed on the back of the box.

With that being said, this Anthology is an awesome addition to my ever-growing Blu-ray collection. I am a little confused, and disappointed by something, however: I was surprised to find that when I popped in the Disk for T2, I was presented with an rather astounding menu, with LOTS of features, but the best part was that I could choose between the theatrical, or Special Edition versions T2 - what was disappointing, and confusing was that the Special Edition of the original Terminator was not included with this anthology - why put one special edition, without including the other? So, it is with some regret that I am knocking a star off due to them not including the Special Edition of the original Terminator; were it not for that, I would give this set 5 stars with no qualms, and it still gets my highest recommendation to buy, as long as you can do without the Special Edition of the first Terminator.",1490486400,4,1025,4.545945945945946

5254073,2,B00938UVC2,"This is an outdated set. I purchased this, assuming that it would contain the best possible quality releases of the Terminator films. I quickly found out that the Terminator 1 disc is the 2006 mpeg 2 release and not the remastered disc with much better video quality which came out recently. Also, the T2 disc is the Skynet edition, which was improved upon a few years back as well by a new release.

With T3, the first release was actually in 1080i by mistake (back in '08) and was quickly pulled from the shelves and replaced with 1080 versions within a few months. If buying new, I'd imagine 9 years later this is not an issue. But buying used on amazon where you cannot check the upc (the only way to tell if its the 1080i or 1080p release), be wary. FYI, the 1080p release has UPC 883929016938, so if possible, check for that.
And do yourself a favor, and don't bother with that poor excuse for a movie called Terminator Salvation. But if you must, all blu-ray versions are the same of that film. Overall, buying all the films separately (especially if you don't want the dreadful Terminator Salvation) should cost about the same as this set.

5254080,2,B00938UVC2,"Seeing a nice collectible set for the Terminator franchise, getting this was a no-brainer. but upon receiving it, it's not what was pictured. if I get a collectible box set, I expect it to look collectible, not thrown together from various sources.the first two films are obviously custom made for this set, the texturing on the disks matches the packaging, then the third one is a silver disk, and the fourth,and bonus disk, solid black. it's very obvious the last two films weren't made for this set and after looking on youtube, discovered that when they first started making this set, they used surplus copies of T-3 and Salvation to fill the box. Not impressed. now the videos stating this were a few years old, so I'm surprised they still have these mismatched sets laying around to ship.

Maybe it's my personal OCD, maybe I just want what was pictured and what I paid for, but the menus for the first two match, the last 2, not even close. again drawing away from the ""Set"" aspect and emphasizing they don't belong in this box. it looks like I'll be shopping around to try and find the actual matching disks to complete this set, or buying it again elsewhere, but it looks like a homemade set, not a collectible box set.

Also, while the T2 disk DOES work for the film, it has a ""Connect to the internet"" startup feature that doesn't despite my player being permanently connected to the net. More of an annoyance than anything, but everything is updated with the latest firmware (checked weekly) so it's obviously a software problem on the original disk. (Did it ever work? who knows....)

**And after watching the ""set"", discovered the third one doesn't even HAVE a menu. pop the disk in and the film starts playing like the cheapest DVD you've ever seen. no bonus features, no setup, no menu AFTER the film finishes, seen that a few times... clicking the ""Disk menu"" button on the remote brings up a pop up ""Not available"" I expect more from Blu-Ray.",1477699200,63,1960,4.626436781609195

I was already connected to the Internet via my PS3 and have always been able to upgrade and download content with ease via my connection. I tried both options: cancel and retry. Neither worked. I got to a black screen and froze there. The menus and/or the movie never loaded. I tried for over 20 min. It's a worthless disc. I just bought this anthology a few months ago, so I'm surprised they are still selling it with a known defective disc. If you do searches (which I regret not doing in advance), you will see a forum board discussing this very issue with similar problems on various players. Such a shame they continue to sell a defective product! Unfortunately, I didn't play T2 within my 30-day return window at Amazon, so I'm stuck with a worthless disc.

UPDATE: I am raising my rating up to two stars (from one) because I did finally get the disc to load and play. It took SEVEN MINUTES in my updated PS3, which normally will load even the most script-heavy Blu-ray Discs in a matter of seconds. I read on a forum that if you kept the disc in and waited (up to 10 minutes!), it will finally load. My did ... after seven. The ""SkyNet"" functionality, which was presumably the problem (pulling personal data from your player so that it loads in your Zip code and gives you a current weather report---and who really needs that even if it sound ""cool""), it never worked. I played the disc off-line with no SkyNet connectivity. I would hope that after all these years, Fox would have mastered a new, reliable disc instead of repackaging the old one with so many known and noted playback issues.",1472256000,4,2138,5.0710227272727275

As for the movies themselves, I have to say that I have a new respect for Salvation, both from my disappointment with Genisys and from watching Salvation again. Salvation isn't not one of the better movies in the series, but it's still pretty good, and I'll take Christian Bale as John Connor over Jason Clarke any day. What were they thinking when they casted Clarke? The giant terminator is a bit out of place, but it's neat to see T-600s and T-700s, a young Kyle Reese trying to scrape by, an awesome digital double of young Arnold, and an explanation for how John got the scars on his face.

I know a lot of people didn't like T3, but I don't get why. I liked how T3 explored how things might play out if there is actually fate in the world of Terminator, as well as John's reluctance to accept his role as leader of the human resistance. Whereas Genisys tied my brain into a pretzel and left me with a bunch of questions, T3 was a straightforward story about an alternate timeline from the one we had seen in the first two movies.

Much has already been said about how awesome T2 is; all I can say is that I agree that T2 is the best movie in the series, and I like its open ending that leans towards the possibility that the Connors succeeded in stopping Judgement Day (with help from Miles Dyson and a reprogrammed terminator).

I used to not be that into the first movie, but as I've seen it a couple of times as an adult, I have more of an appreciation for it. In particular, the supporting characters seem more fleshed out, rather than simply being part of the background.",1470096000,,1837,4.362573099415204

My box was delivered damaged, dented and creased. The T-3 disc is silver, not black like the others -I despise inconsistency.
I paid the $79 As I LOVE these movies, yet my box came with a $16 price sticker.
I will be willing to keep the product for a partial refund - at wich time I will also raise the product rating.",1430697600,3,432,4.216867469879518

I am giving it 4 stars because Genisys is coming out so you might as well wait to get a collection with all 5 movies (or get this on the cheap at least - i paid 20 = $5 per movie is a steal) And add the others as they come because it looks like this franchise will be around for a while!) I don't care what anyone says the trailer for Genisys looks amazing and the crazier they make these movies the better - don't pretend you want a sequel that holds more closely to the original.

5254234,5,B00938UVC2,"OK Amazon. Today, 4 days into 2015, have heard that another Terminator may be forthcoming... Just when we thought it was over, another byte of the cherry to be 'pipped at the post' by. The extrication of John Connor from the evil that the internet can bring, could possibly have been posted by any of the forums available online.  John C. could write his own cyblog, cancelling out the premise for the continuum of said franchise The existing  anthology may be brought undone by another episode similar to that of 'Expire Unyielding', wherein the franchise has been neatly shelved. If this be the case, it will certainly have a lot to live up to in conspiring a belief that like Oliver, there is more to be had from a franchise which had ended  on a satisfactory diminutive. However, the desire to have another fusillade should warrant the packaging to be provided with double sided tape for affixing to the anthology already acquired. Yes alright, am behind the times! The scheduled release is forecast for June 2015, and may turn out to be a remake of the original. What will they do? Spoil it for that first time round adventure!! That has been done before with remakes. Another 20 years into the future, there may be a 16 disc release of all versions, plus directors cuts, hologram projection & sonic soundtrack aurally enhanced for your inner ear.

The rest of the movies are OK. Even though I enjoyed them I couldn't help but feel they ruined what was a perfect ending with T2.

1. The package is so cool, high relieve on the terminator's face and the discs have a match color with the environment of destruction that the series have.
2. The Terminator, the quality is fine, sound not so much, besides that you enjoy the film as you're on the but the movie theater, cut scenes are interesting specially for those that haven't seen it.
3. Terminator 2 - Judgement Day, this is the best movie of the saga in my opinion, FX, story, cast, sound etc. The set comes with the Skynet Edition of the film so this is a lot of new content in the disc, the remastered of the image and sound are so well done, and the special edition of the film is much much better that the theatrical edition.
4. Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation, the most recent films so the quality and sound are more modern that the other films, extras are so well.

A must buy for the hardcore collector of movies.",1407369600,2,978,4.309782608695652

I love the additional footage in the directors cut and never realized some of the theatrical version references footage only found in the director's cut.

I also enjoyed the original Terminator behind the scenes special features.  Like the fact the Arnold was originally cast to play Kyle Reese, and both Arnold and James Cameron had epiphanies that Arnold should be the Terminator instead.

5254318,2,B00938UVC2,"Recommend READING advertising FINE PRINT & other reviews if you're NOT absolutely sure EVERY DISK of this anthology will run on your equipment.  (1.5 DVDs out of the 5 don't work w/mine.) I checked more reviews after I discovered that disk 2 & part of disk 5 won't work on my system.  I'd previously seen T1, T2, and T3 (theater versions.) I'd not seen T4 before, and really enjoyed it.  Some of the editorial comments re comparisons to the Wizard of Oz were a little lost on me since I never did figure out which Oz character Marcus was--he has a brain. heart & courage.  He gains & looses some of each as T4 progresses.  Sam Worthington is outstanding as Marcus.  Christian Bale going head to head with Sam Worthington was best part T4--maybe best of entire series.  A lot additional material has been included in this anthology.  It adds much texture and depth.  I didn't rate the anthology higher because I could not watch one DVD (T2) or a portion of the bonus disk on my equipment. The T2 DVD is SKYNET ed which does NOT work with my equipment.  The advertising lists it that way, but doesn't clarify what is meant (or provide warning about needed system requirements) to play DVD. Part of the bonus DVD also needed equipment I don't have. Had I known more about Skynet ed & it's hard/soft ware issues w/2 of the disks, I would have purchased DVDs compatible w/my equipment.  1 DVD has the set up near the end of the movie--very annoying since I like to add subtitles for the hard of hearing before I actually watch the movie.

All other disc have a nice elaborated cover (black and gray, like some sort of granite style) but in the collection I received, Disc 3 Rise of the Machine is just a simple disc (silver cover style)

It looks like, when the product was packed someone made a mistake and the disc 3 included does not belong to the collection.
I do not know if this is supposed to be like that or if it was a human error.

But I wanted to share this review, in case this could happen to other users in the future.

I wanted to make an update in this review, I checked yesterday disc 3 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and I am very disappointed, as noted the disc included in this Anthology is just a sloppy version, it doesn't even fit in the collection, it's like a regular release was placed instead, the audio is not even - DTS Surround Sound - but - Dolby Digital 5.1 - It's like watching an upscale DVD version of Terminator 3, despite of the price I got this product, I can tell I am very disappointed with it at this point.

5254408,5,B00938UVC2,"This is an outstanding Blu-Ray box set of one of my favorite movie franchises. I already own earlier DVD versions of these films, and have seen them several times over the years, but not lately.  So when this set arrived, my wife and I set aside a rainy afternoon to enjoy a Blu-Ray Terminator Marathon.
Be advised- The first movie ran perfectly, but we got to T2, the disc refused to load up.  I Googled the problem and found that we needed some sort of firmware update on our Blu-Ray player. I didn't even try to fix the problem via the internet. Instead we skipped ahead and watched T3 and T4, then later I put the T2 disc back in and managed to scroll through the menu and got a version to play.  So, after some frustration we did finally get to see the movie.  I ordered the firmware update DVD from Sony for $6, installed it a few days later, and now the player (and T2 disc) work fine.
If, like me, you love the Terminator movies, I'm certain that, T-2 frustrations aside, you'll love this box set.  The packaging is beautiful and the classic movies (especially T1 in my opinion) are spectacular in Blu Ray from start to finish.  I look forward to another Blu-Ray Terminator Marathon next year, and this time we'll watch all 4 movies in order!",1378080000,121,1250,4.3896103896103895
5254409,4,B00938UVC2,"I am rating the entire set here of the Terminator movies collection. As for the individual movies, I rate them all 5 stars except Terminator Salvation which I rate 4 stars...not enough Arnold! Plus, the story line lacks redeeming qualities. You can see reviews for each movie if you want to know more specific details.

As for this entire movie set, it really is a great collection of the Terminator movies including the director's cut and extended versions. There is also a cool commentary version showing the making of the movies and how the special effects are incorporated in the movies. If you like the Terminator movies, you will probably (most likely) want to have this set in your DVD collection. I know I'm really happy to have it.

The few things I didn't like about this movie set is the first Terminator movie was not as clear (sharp) as I had hoped for a Bluray release. This may be unavoidable due to original production limitations. I also didn't like that the other movies started with (advertising) movie previews. When I buy a movie to watch, I expect to be able to start watching my movie immediately. Also, Terminator 2 includes an online interactive mode which I found slow and really was just more advertising.

Overall, even with these (IMO) minor annoyances, I believe this is a ""must have"" Terminator movies collection nicely packaged with cool graphics. Plus, the folding design of the DVDs holder is unique with each movie individually snapped securely and safely into place.",1377820800,4,1502,4.836575875486381

The picture quality is good but the audio is average (the original seems aged). There is about 2 hours of extras on here which is fairly light for 4 films. Bonus material includes deleted scenes, James Cameron interviews, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes videos, and multimedia galleries. This anthology lacks a truly comprehensive documentary on the making of the franchise. There is some exclusive HD content but it's all interactive trivia games.

If you are looking at this you have definitely seen these movies before. If you don't own them then this is a great opportunity. This is the first time that this set is available as a single box set. There had been some issue with different companies owning the rights but it looks like they are finally under one roof.

For me I spent my life owning the first one in VHS and the second on DVD. This box set is a nice thing to have. Even though I have purchased these movies before it is nice to have an upgraded image and sound while getting the two newer movies as a bonus.

I also consider this a deal as for much of the time on amazon this product cost 45 dollars with only occasional dips to this price. I also feel like I am getting a steal since I probably paid more than 25 dollars to get the original movie on VHS 25 years ago.

These movies are a great deal for me because of the nostalgia they provide but the movies also stand up through the test if time. If you are considering this deal I would pull the trigger and enjoy life a little bit more.",1376524800,4,1085,4.07981220657277

The original soundtrack theme has been changed and does not sound punchy and dramatic like the original. Almost all of the sound effects have been changed. During the truck scene just before Kyle uses the bomb to destroy the large truck the Terminator is driving, as Kyle's stolen truck tumbles over that scene is cut short and Sarah screams twice in the original version, not once as in this version.

All the gun shot sound effects have been altered. No longer are they the original BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM-BOOM but piff piff piff piff-piff. I am not a gun or violence fanatic but an original movie fanatic (perhaps nut) trying to make a point - the sound effects are all a part of the original film and they create the atmosphere of what made the original film what it was.

I had purchased this set awhile ago and sat down tonight looking forward to watching ""The Terminator"" as I remembered it. Not so with this set. If you're looking for the original version, I would pass on this blu-ray release unless you don't mind the edits. I hope the other versions of the Terminator films have not been altered, and that there is an Easter Egg opportunity to at least view all the deleted scenes together in Terminator 2 like in Terminator 2: Extreme Edition.",1367107200,197,1338,4.570833333333334

5254438,4,B00938UVC2,"""The Terminator Anthology""  is a five-disc Blu-ray set containing seven versions of the four ""Terminator"" movies -- the four theatrical versions, two additional ""Terminator: Judgment Day"" editions, and the R-rated Director's Cut of ""Terminator: Salvation.""  The first three star Arnold Schwarzenegger, the fourth stars Christian Bale.  These films were released previously on Blu-ray, but this set bundles them together with a neat collection of bonus extras.

The original 1984 feature still ranks as one of the cleverest science-fiction movies of the last 30 years.  The script combines the tried-and-true sci-fi ingredient of robot-run-amok with time travel, and is well served by the solid performances of Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn, cool special effects, and plenty of action.  Many films over the years have tried to duplicate its success but paled by comparison.

""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" gave us the unforgettable images of an evil robot (Robert Patrick) morphing into different objects via a silvery, metallic liquid -- a real eye-opener at the time.  Those scenes still pack a wallop.

The fourth picture has a pretty good script and Christian Bale does an acceptable job, but Schwarzenegger is sorely missed.

8535094,1,B00938UVC2,This review is just about the presentation. The movies are fine but be aware that this item pictures all discs the same color and pattern as a set but what I received from Amazon  was the version with the 3rd movie having a silver disc instead of a black with patterns one. It looks like this disc doesnt belong to the whole set. Items should be as pictured..,1529539200,,359,4.279411764705882
