8208145,5,B000T9D64Y,One of the very few true pilates programs on the market designed and done as Joseph Pilates intended . Great for a beginner. I buy them for fitness clients as gifts all the time,1419984000,,177,4.235294117647059
8208146,3,B000T9D64Y,"I think this DVD is fine for absolute beginners but for anyone who has done pilates with a personal trainer or taken mat classes with a good teacher for a long time, this DVD is simply too easy.",1297296000,,194,4.131578947368421
8208147,1,B000T9D64Y,"This is a very basic introduction and not really a workout. It is also very short, maybe15min. max.  Explanations not helpful. Don't waste your money.",1295222400,5,150,5.0
8208148,5,B000T9D64Y,Because I have enjoyed Stott Pilates for over a year now - the results are in... and my clothing fits as if I had a body shaper underneath! -- Pilates has been the best for my posture and I receive many compliments.  Because I have so many - I am selling my extra brand new Standing Tall that I just received from my Aunt this past Christmas for a low price,1294876800,,357,4.028169014084507
8208149,5,B000T9D64Y,"I have fibromyalgia, and go in and out of feeling good enough to exercise.  Lately, I have been on a 'spurt', and tried this tape.  It made me feel so good, because even though my core isn't much, it was worked over, without feeling totally drained by the end of it!  Something I really can do, and I've made it my every other day workout, for as long as my body will let me.  I think it's going to help make me get stronger fast.  I also tried many other of her tapes recently, and love them all.  I haven't tried any 'challenge' one, because I'm lucky to do any right now!  The bands workouts are terrific for my in between days.  Thanks for the real uplift Ms. Merrithew, and for making me feel stronger every day too!",1277337600,3,721,4.173913043478261
8208150,4,B000T9D64Y,"If you're new to Pilates, this is a great place to get started. It covers the basic movements you need to master. However, with that said, I think it's best to start one-on-one with a Pilates instructor. Many of the movements in Pilates are very subtle, so it's helpful to have a professional instructor guide you if you're just starting out. Once you have worked with an instructor, this video makes a nice supplemental work-out for those ""off"" days. Let's face it, one-on-one sessions can be expensive. I find working with an instructor 1-2 times per week, and then using videos on other days, is a great way to stretch my dollar.",1265500800,3,632,4.651785714285714
8208151,3,B000T9D64Y,"The workout is easy enough to follow. It covers an overall body workout for around 30 minutes - abs, back, thighs.

I did, however, find myself relying on my previous experience with pilates elsewhere in order to get the most out of the workout. The instructor, Moira, does a good attempt reminding when to breathe and which body parts to take note of, but it is really nothing like having an instructor on-hand to correct your posture, etc.

Bottom-line, I would buy it for someone else - but only if the person had tried pilates before. Still, this DVD matched what I was looking for - which was a supplement pilates regime I could do in the comfort of my home. The wonderful thing about being a DVD is that i could pause to re-do certain exercises, or simply double-up and do 2 sessions of the workout for a longer workout.

I read some other review about the sing-song voice but it didn't bother me at all. Besides, there is an option to do the workout to music only.",1260230400,13,971,4.41340782122905
8208152,2,B000T9D64Y,"I wanted a video to supplement what I've learned through private lessons.  This one was awful!  The instructor doesn't give sufficient detail as to what you actually need to do - she seems more caught up in perfecting her performance of chanting the commands in a singsong voice.  I could have tolerated the voice had she been actually telling you what to do.  I would not recommend this for beginners, nor anyone else.",1214352000,3,419,4.698630136986301
8208153,1,B000T9D64Y,"I'm a pilates novice but even i noticed that this video lacked instruction to good form (like when to ""imprint"") or proper breathing which are KEY to a good workout. For those who've done pilates before: The ""hundred"" was shown with both feet placed on the floor - it wasn't even worth it. When the video ended I was still waiting for the workout to begin. I was very surprised that I was this disappointed, but I'll never use this video again.",1214179200,9,444,4.426829268292683
8208154,5,B000T9D64Y,"This beginner level DVD is perfect for the newbie or those getting back into shape after taking time off from fitness. It is a no-nonsense, basic, easy-to-follow 30 minute pilates routine that for me produced a light burn (which I hadn't expected!) The teacher is calm and pleasant and easy to understand, the music is not overwhelming, and there is no hippy dippy BS to roll your eyes through. MY only wish is that there were more than one workout available on the DVD. It is what it is, which is a wonderful thing!",1212019200,15,516,4.5
