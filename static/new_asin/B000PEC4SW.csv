- Alexandre Dumas (un petit caf): ""Bonjour, M. Derek. Comment a-va?""

- John Derek (tall, half-skinny, half-1 percent, extra hot, two shots decaf, two shots regular latte with whip): ""I'm sorry, old dude. I don't speak Spanish.""

- Dumas: ""...""

- Dumas: ""Er, c'est d'accord, let us then converse in English. I congratulate you, monsieur. I note that you will soon be starring in this minor swashbuckler.""

- Derek: ""That's right, old dude. MASK OF THE AVENGER, 1951, from Columbia Pictures. And you're pretty stand up for letting us reference the Count of Monte Cristo. You're swell, froggie.""

- Dumas: ""Do not thank me, sir. That property lies in the territory of public domain. I have no say. Also I am long dead. But how do you intend to follow in the footsteps of Robert Donat and Louis Hayward? I understand they were both memorable in their roles.""

- Derek: ""I don't know about those cats. But I'm not at all playing the infamous Count.""

- Dumas: ""I beg you, monsieur, even as you partake of your weak caf americain, perhaps you may set the stage? To my shame, I profess ignorance with regards to the thrust of your picture's narrative.""

- Derek (waving at a mosquito): ""Huh?""

- Dumas (politely): ""S'il vous plait, what is the story about?""

- Derek: (still waving at a mosquito): ""Oh. Well, it's set in 1848, in the tiny Italian village of Calamari, no, Casamare, where in the town square sits a statue of your Count of Monty Python--""

- Dumas: ""Pardon. Monte Cristo.""

- Derek: ""Whatever, dude. There's this corrupt but cultured cat, some sort of military governor, Viovanni Larocca, played by Anthony Quinn, and they're saying he's very good here, but whatever. Well, he's the big bad.""

- Dumas: ""Er, big bad what?""

- Derek: ""Wow, you don't watch Buffy, do you?""

- Dumas (blank stare)

- Derek: ""Okay, Anthony Quinn murders this aristocrat who accused him of corruption. Quinn frames the poor guy as a traitor. Anyway, the plot really takes off when the bumped off guy's son, Captain Renato Dimorna, played by me, returns home on leave. I'm immediately reviled by the villagers for being a traitor's son and I'm outraged and get all up in their faces and I get beat up bad.""

- Dumas: ""My condolences, sir.""

- Derek:  ""Hey, did I tell you I married three total babes?""

- Dumas: ""That is disturbing.""

- Derek: ""Anyway, I vow revenge on Larocca. But I pretend to buy into his being a stand up fella. I take advantage of an injured right foot to pretend I'm an invalid, but in the darkness of night I put on a mask and a cool black cloak that flares out sweetly and ride horses and have sword fights and stuff. Hey, I'm out of coffee and I have to use the bathroom.""

- Dumas (minutes later): ""I understand there is a political undertone to the film? In 1848, was Italy not engaged in conflict with Austria?""

- Derek: ""I guess. I didn't see one kangaroo, though.""

- Dumas: ""...""

- Dumas: ""Who is Jody Lawrance?""

- Derek: ""This babe making her film debut. She's my love interest named Maria, and she's smoking hot. She's got the makings of Wifey #4.""

- Dumas: ""Word has it that the spirited Mlle. Lawrance also, em, how to put it, swashes her own buckle?""

- Derek: ""No, she likes men, but her character swings a mean sword and she does take a turn playing the Ghost of Monte Cristo, which is what they call me when I'm in my mask and being all dashing and mysterious.""

- Dumas: ""C'est bien, MASK OF THE AVENGER seems promising. Is there more to divulge about this film, monsieur?""

- Derek: ""There's secret messages hidden in oranges. Ooooooh.""

- Dumas: ""...""

- Derek (getting up): ""Well, it's been swell, Maurice Chevalier. Here, let me get the check. Hey, gargoyle!!""

- Dumas (under his breath): ""Espce de sale enfoir d'encul de fils de pute, je t'emmerde, j'encule ta mre et je te chie  la gueule.""",1383696000,,3898,4.567723342939481
8190850,2,B000PEC4SW,"I liked this movie when I saw it on television, but the vhs tape contained colorant which is a product so the tape can not be reproduced. John Derek was excellent in the part but the vhs tape played very poorly so I can not recommend it to anyone.",1312588800,,247,4.061224489795919
