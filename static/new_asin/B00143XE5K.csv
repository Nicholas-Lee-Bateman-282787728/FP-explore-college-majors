Looks like only 4 or 5 episodes will be on each disc for this set. Why not do a 4 disc set and make it cheaper? I bet the next set will have 3 episodes per disc. Great show though!",1206921600,2,253,3.7037037037037037

3122039,5,B00143XE5K,"After years of suffering through having to get 2 boxed sets to watch all the complete Cell saga. Its now on 1 dvd boxed set.
The Cell Saga is the best Saga in the DBZ Universe.
Trunks, Vegeta, Goku asend past super saiyan but before super saiyan 2 and Gohan goes super saiyan 2.
If you get only one dbz boxed set this is it. Nothing else matters

Now i have edit this cause people are saying it doesnt include the cell games. Which we don't know that funimation can add more episodes on each dvds.
With Yu Yu Hakusho they were able to fit 7 episodes pre dvd. So we will have to wait and see",1204848000,,590,4.042735042735043
3122040,5,B00143XE5K,"I zipped through the Season 4 DVD box set so fast!  The series really picks up speed during these sagas as the Z fighters are all really becoming very powerful, turning into Super Saiyans and what not- I know this doesn't include the Cell Games saga (*sigh*), but that's ok- the imperfect and perfect cell sagas are very cool as well- watching the Z fighters getting so strong is so slick- May 27!? That's so far away!",1204675200,,418,4.428571428571429
3122041,5,B00143XE5K,"like what everyone else says. I can't wait till this set comes out.
I already have it ordered. i'll do that with all of them.

okay the first favorite saga is the freiza saga. ( reason why ) well it has to be the episode (Transformed at last) that is a emotional episode, losing a friend right in front of you. man that's is my favorite part when Goku becomes a SUPER SAIYAN for the first time. But that's not the full reason. this set has the best fight scenes in it.

All Z warriors are my favorite. but my #1 favorite character has to be GOKU!. went through all transformations minus the mystic saiyan.

enough of that.

dragonball z by far the best anime series watched on TV.

I'm wandering if thier going to do the same with the original dragonball series?",1204588800,,762,4.300699300699301
3122042,5,B00143XE5K,"This is probobly one of the more action packed boxes you will find. My only complaint is the fact that it has less than 30 episodes, but its understandable. Like the previous boxsets, it is completely uncut and remastered, and still has 3 audio options. but honestly, would it kill funimation to have some actuall dvd extras? trailers are fine, but interviews with the voice actors would be nice, or some old toonami promos would be even better! once again the image is cropped, which you would only notice if youve seen the episodes previously and are very familiar with the product. if your new to dbz, you probobly wouldnt notice that the feet and hair is cut off. but i will continue to buy these boxsets, and i definitly reccomend buying it, if your new to dbz though you should get the first season first. but you owe it to yourself to buy these action packed episodes!",1204416000,,875,4.544303797468355

The DVD set unfourtunitly ends at the start of the Cell games and doesn't get into any of the actual fighting between Cell and Gohan. Other than that, it's an improperly titled season, do to the fact that there were orionally 8 seasons and the cell saga was season 5, not season 5 and 6. Because if you purchase season 6, which by all rights is the beginning of the Boo saga. The season 6 disc starts off with the Cell Games tournament. Where they made the Boo sage start out with disc 7. Now being a life long, royal fan of DBZ and Funimation, this urks. I personally feel they split these episodes up by the number of episodes so every set had the same number of episodes.

3122196,5,B00143XE5K,"One of my personal favorite seasons, this season of course covers the Perfect and Imperfect Cell Sagas. It highlights interesting developments among the Z-fighters, namely Piccolo, Trunks, and Vegeta. The first three-fourths of the episodes lack much filler episodes, making this great for viewing if you want action and story. However, the last few episodes are incredibly full of filler, making the last few episodes a bit exhausting to watch. I mean, Trunks just never stops talking!!!!!!",1397865600,,491,5.3896103896103895

The first few seasons did, but I couldn't find a single one of the newer seasons with it. Other than that, I'm very happy to finally have my collection complete. :) Now I move onto collecting all the movies that were made. Just 3 more to go!",1386547200,,407,4.1645569620253164

3122210,5,B00143XE5K,"If your looking to buy the Dragonball Z seasons this is the best choice for your dollar. This is the full on UN-CUT original Japanese anime the way it was meant to be seem, Blood crude humor cussing in some seasons. This is the best choice if your an adult collector looking for the best anime if your looking for the cut and edited stuff to buy for your kids then look up dragon ball z KAI those are the seasons meant to be viewed by kids of a younger age group. But if your adult looking for this series buy these versions.",1378857600,,525,4.106796116504855
3122211,5,B00143XE5K,"Bought as a gift. There is implied nudity at times, nothing bad obviously as it is a children's show, and a lot of yelling and fighting. Gender roles are very strong-the men and boys both train and fight the evil dudes and the women are mostly pretty and motherly. Don't have any complaints about the show, and would recommend buying the full seasons.",1378598400,,351,4.587301587301587
3122212,4,B00143XE5K,Bought these for a nephew who really liked the show so he could watch the whole show all the way through.,1377734400,,105,4.0476190476190474

3122221,5,B00143XE5K,"This DVD is perfect. It contains 26 episodes and a marathon mode so that you do not have to sit through the opening credits that are LONG. It is not heavily editted like the DBZ Kai that is played on television. You get to enjoy the full episodes. I am halfway through and ready to order the next dvd. At 15 bucks, you cannot beat it!",1374364800,,334,4.075757575757576

3122224,5,B00143XE5K,"I feel kinda silly writing a review of this. My guess is you either love DBZ and have to have every season, or you don't like it and have religious issues. At any rate this is season five and perhaps the darkest chapter of the Z series simply because Cell goes around turning everyone inside out. I just thought he was a disgusting creature and wanted to see him get his just desserts throughout the entire thing. It has a cliff hanger ending with all the Z warriors training to battle Cell. That's about all, I think other than that I will stick to my initial statement above.",1369526400,,577,4.351851851851852
3122225,5,B00143XE5K,"Great price, great show. Its friggin Dragon Ball Z, guys. How can you go wrong for $20? the answer to that is... you cant.",1369180800,,122,4.125
3122226,4,B00143XE5K,i liked the one episode of say good bye android 17 i did not like the long time to get to that episode with the commercials and i would like a direct way to view episode,1368403200,,169,3.7222222222222223

3122229,5,B00143XE5K,"I love all DBZ movies and episodes plus DBGT, I wish I could rate this higher.  I bought all the movies and all the sagas and I thought they were cheap especially since they do not make them anymore.",1365033600,,199,4.102564102564102
3122230,5,B00143XE5K,It was nice to find this was almost half off. It never goes on sale in my local stores. Also nice having an HD remastered version of the show.,1363910400,,142,3.9310344827586206
3122231,5,B00143XE5K,bought it for a present and my husband has been wanting these for awhile. he loves it and wants the rest,1362268800,,104,4.0
3122232,5,B00143XE5K,absolutely perfect exactly as i remember the original dragon ball z but obviously in better quality now :) :) :),1361750400,,112,4.65
3122233,5,B00143XE5K,"The presentation of the Dragonball Z series is brilliant. It is well worth the money and I would suggest it to any DBZ fan.

The remastering quality is good, just the cutting of the frames that really irritates me. Having been moved aspect ratios, the top and bottom have both been cut off leaving you with a lesser image. It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!

Other than that, the marathon feature is  a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf.",1361232000,,675,4.299212598425197
3122234,5,B00143XE5K,Perfect for a fan because you don't have to worry about it being censored and you have every episode at you fingertips.,1360972800,,119,4.454545454545454

3122236,5,B00143XE5K,This to me is one of the best seasons. Cell gains his ultimate form and beats the crap out of Vegeta and Trunks. It was also funny when he knocked out Krillin.,1360886400,,159,4.0
3122237,5,B00143XE5K,I own all of the sets because this is one of the greatest TV series ever. I also plan on buying the GT saga.,1360713600,,108,3.5416666666666665

Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.

3122255,4,B00143XE5K,"First of all, there are some very good episodes on this disk. In this season, we are introduced to Cell, and the season consists of him absorbing people to get stronger. Cell is a very creepy villain and he gives DBZ a ""horror movie"" feel. This is the season where Goku gets better, and as the threat of Cell grows stronger, he decides to train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber with Gohan, and Vegeta trains with Trunks. This season really feels like a buildup to season 6, the Cell Games Saga, and that's a good thing, because (without giving the ending away) you get the feeling that the Cell Saga is really heading for an epic conclusion.

As for the actual set, the packaging is nice visually. The remastering process is a bit flawed, unfortunately. Not only has the image been cropped to 16:9 when it is meant to be 4:3 (resulting in some of the top and bottom being cut off), but some of the details on characters is lost from the remastering. The film was put through a machine that not only ate up the grain and dirt, but it took off some of the lines as well. Also, the image can be a bit blurry at times. However, I'd still say that overall it looks good, and this is the best DBZ has ever looked, with the exception of the Dragon Boxes of course. Other flaws with this set is that the Japanese dub is in mono, not stereo, sound. So for fans of the Japanese dub, I would recommend shelling out a bit more cash for the Dragon Boxes instead. Also, if you want to see remastered DBZ looking it's best, buy the Dragon Boxes.

If you're a fan of Bruce Faulconer's music, however, pick these up. The good thing is that these sets give you the option of watching the English dub with the Japanese music (the Dragon Boxes also have that option). The bottom line is, if you're a fan of DBZ who simply wants the episodes, get these for the cheaper price; they're still a very good way to collect the series. If you want DBZ remastered to it's best (and if you don't care about Faulconer's music), get the Dragon Boxes.",1309651200,4,2016,4.316622691292876

3122261,3,B00143XE5K,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Five DVD box set includes six DVDs that contain twenty-six episodes.  The first two discs contain six episodes, the third disc contains five episodes, the fourth and fifth discs contain three episodes, and the sixth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.

The special features really aren't all that special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which is a feature that was already included on the previous four DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for xxxHolic, Glass Fleet, Black Cat, Fullmetal Alchemist, Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Baki the Grappler, and Samurai 7.

Another issue I have with this set is with the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's opening splash screen, the trailers at the beginning of the DVDs, and the menu were mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes on the discs were mastered with a very soft audio level.  It's rather frustrating to have to sharply turn the volume down when you put the DVD into the player, and then having to sharply turn the audio back up in order to hear the audio for the episodes.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.  This 26-episode set sells for anywhere between $30 and $50.  The price is a little disappointing for this set, since you paid the same price for the previous four sets but you get more episodes on the previous volumes.

I bought the complete collections about 20 days ago. its amazing & awesome. the only problem i had is the English subtitles doesn't work with English 5.1 & 2.0. its only work with the Japanese audio. rather then that every thing else its good. PQ & SQ spicily the Japanese music. Highly recommended",1273363200,,322,4.75
3122263,4,B00143XE5K,"I'll start this review by stating the only thing that really needs to be reiterated, because so many other reviewers get this wrong. The image is not flat out cropped, some is cropped but new picture is also shown just as much. The original transfers were all cropped generally so they could `pan' certain shots across a scene. Therefore you aren't losing as much picture as many reviewers falsely claim. People should really do their research before they pretend to know about something.

Okay, moving on this box set is more of the same. English dubbing with original Japanese music in surround sound, English dubbing with English soundtrack in stereo, and original Japanese mono are the audio choices presented as usual. The redubbing that Funimation had done has mostly stopped by this point. Vegeta and Krillin now use their original audio, and only Dende remains to be redubbed since his VA changed. Some parts of this saga should be redubbed, however. For starters, Master Roshi gives a history lesson on the Red Ribbon Army that is entirely wrong. When Funimation originally dubbed the series they had not yet done Dragon Ball, just the movies. As such it was in the movies that Tao was a General with the Red Ribbon Army character (though it wasn't in the Red Ribbon Army). Roshi's English dub states that Tao was a high ranking general in Red Ribbon. Of course, anybody who's seen dragon ball knows this isn't true, and that Tao was a mercenary hired to kill Goku. They tried to consolidate the movie into the timeline which was well enough all those years ago, but Funi really should've taken the time to fix errors like this.

As for the story itself, the imperfect and perfect Cell Sagas were among the most intense action-packed sequences in the series' history. It starts off with the startling new revelation of another android from the same future Trunks is from who's come back in time in order to absorb the androids and obtain his perfect form before he destroys the world. Piccolo finally merges back with Kami and the two of them prove to be too much for the new genetically engineered android to handle, but Cell manages to elude them all the same. The series slows down a bit as the Z-Fighters pointlessly chase Cell around while the other Androids go on sight-seeing on their way to Goku's house. Finally Goku wakes up and takes the other saiyans Vegeta, Trunks, and his son Gohan to the Lookout. The plan is to use a special room to complete an entire year of training in a single day so that they can achieve a level beyond that of a Super Saiyan.

Everything comes to a head when the other three androids arrive at Roshi's island looking for Goku, and instead find Piccolo waiting for them. The proceeding fight between Piccolo and Android 17 is one of the best in the entire series, but unfortunately is the last really great fight. Both fighters are incredibly powerful and skilled fighters. Their battle is far more dynamic then the simple light shows, excessive transformations, and cheap abilities that would plague the rest of the series. It's also the last time Piccolo manages to be relevant in the series. A bummer for Piccolo fans.

But the fight doesn't stop there, the action continues right up until Cell's arrival. Seeking to absorb the androids, Cell makes short work of both Piccolo and 17 before 16 interferes. The large android has a short, one-sided skirmish with Cell but is unable to stop him from absorbing 17 and transforming. Things start to get somewhat uniform from here. In his new form Cell easily defeats 16 and goes to absorb 18 but is stopped by none other than Tien. In his last moment of relevance, the veteran human fighter almost kills himself using his Tri Beam to restrain Cell while the Androids escape. Both Piccolo and Tien are rescued by Goku, but Cell resumes his quest.

With the androids cornered on an island, Vegeta and Trunks emerge from their training and are ready to face Cell. Vegeta undergoes a new transformation and ascends past the level of Super Saiyan, from there he has a one-sided fight with Cell, but the biological android convinces the saiyan prince to let him absorb 18 and become complete. He does so and after his final transformation to his perfect form, Cell easily defeats Vegeta and Trunks. You see the pattern now? Cell transforms and dominates 16, Vegeta transforms and dominates Cell, Cell transforms again and dominates Vegeta. So on and so on, this is basically how the rest of the series progresses.

Moreso, Cell manages to be a rather cheap villain. While he is very strong, his only attacks are ones he's copied from the other Z-Fighters and previous villains whose genes he's inherited. He has no attacks or fighting style of his own. Vegeta actually manages to hit Cell with his new Final Flash attack that maims the villain but Cell effortlessly regenerates the damage. Even Piccolo needs time and energy to regenerate, and even so he can regrow limbs but cannot repair all the damage done to him. Cell takes his regeneration to newer and cheaper levels. The fight would've ended when Vegeta nailed his attack, but Cell's genetic makeup allows him to survive and thrive. However instead of killing his victims, Cell decides to release them, for the moment.

But as much as I find Cell to be unappealing, it's hard to deny that the nonstop action presented in this saga is pretty epic in anime scale. From the moment the fight between 17 and Piccolo starts, it doesn't end until Cell defeats Trunks after becoming perfect. It spreads across several islands, involves a modest cast of characters, and crosses several tiers of power.

Continuing from where the Androids Saga (from the Season Four set) left off, eventually, Trunks and the rest of the good guys find a discarded exoskeleton that Imperfect Cell, another of my favorite villains from the show, and Dr. Gero's greatest creation, had when he was in his larvae form, after coming from Trunks' alternate timeline, and the good guys soon find out that, Cell, with his scorpion-like, needle-like tail, has been absorbing people in cities across the world, trying to absorb Androids 17 and 18 so he can get his perfect form, become Perfect Cell, and rule the world/get rid of all people living in it, so the good guys find and eventually battle against him. Throughout the sagas, Goku becomes affected by the heart virus Trunks told him he was going to get from his saga in the second-to-last saga from the other boxset, he recovers from it eventually, Imperfect Cell absorbs Android 17, becomes his second form, Semi-Perfect Cell, then after a while, absorbs Android 18 and becomes Perfect Cell, and near the end of the Perfect Cell saga, announces his Cell Games Tournament, which leads up to the next boxset, Season 6 (Cell Games Saga). You get all of the episodes from Season Five(Imperfect Cell and Perfect Cell Sagas combined), such as the one before it and ""Piccolo's Folly"", where Piccolo battles against Imperfect Cell and tricks him into telling him where he came from and how Dr. Gero made him so Piccolo can regenerate his arm that Cell had absorbed, the one where Android 16 battles against Cell and Cell absorbs Android 17, and the one where Perfect Cell announces his Cell Games Tournament.

3122279,4,B00143XE5K,"One of my favorite episodes in the ""DRAGON BALL Z"" anime series was the Cell saga.  The toughest enemy that the team has fought yet and the series focuses on everyone trying to prevent Cell from absorbing the androids while the Saiyan's Goku and son Gohan and Vegita and his son Trunks (future) train to get stronger, so they can prepare to fight Cell.

With each DVD season box set release of ""DRAGON BALL Z"", as a hardcore fan of the series, it's just incredible to get over 30 episodes for almost the same price or less than most American television box sets.

Season 5 surprisingly in duration wise, shorter than the previous volumes.  Where each DVD had around 5 or more episodes, on disc 4-6, there are only three episodes on each disc.

I was surprised and I have to admit that I would be upset if Funimation did this from here on in but I understand that it's business and with everyone buying these box sets because it's awesome price for a large number of episodes, you can't beat it.  But I'm just hoping that this is not a permanent decision.

VIDEO:

The video looks great on DVD and for those of us who have multi-generation fansubs or fading VHS tapes, just having these episodes on DVD and everything looking great. I know some people have a problem with the show receiving some cropping but for me it's quite miniscule.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features include trailers and open and ending themes. If there was one thing lacking, it's the fact that there are really nothing in terms of special features.

Season 5 ends with a cliffhanger to the upcoming Cell games chapter and at the time of writing this review, Season 6 is now available in retail.

There is a lot of action in this series and no filler episodes.  It's straight mayhem as Cell continues to absorb people and the heroes can do nothing but just hope they can hang on for a day or more while the Saiyans complete their training and hope to defeat Cell.

The Cell series was quite popular back then when I was watching the series in straight Japanese and the whole android storyline was just exciting to watch (especially the special episode in Future Trunks world which pits him and an older Gohan against the evil androids).

Speaking of the special, the special is not included and I assume that they will hopefully release it with the movie collection re-release.  But for those who have never seen it and don't intend to buy it, there is an episode that shows footage from that special.

Overall, Season 5 is a very good box set.  I was put off by the sudden drop of episodes when you reach disc 4 and noticed every disc thereafter only has three episodes.  Again, I hope this is not where the future of the box sets are going.  But with season 6 now available, I guess I'll find out.

Nevertheless, you still get over 20 episodes but after being spoiled with 30 or more episodes per box set, it just sucks to get this drop.  But I understand it's a business decision that probably will work since people are hooked on this DVD box set for its sheer amount of episodes and great price.

While the visual quality isn't necessarily HORRIBLE to the naked eye, it is nowhere near as pretty as it's supposed to be (as seen on the official Japanese DVDs). The Japanese audio is also improved on those releases, I really recommend buying some of those if you can afford it.  You will NOT be sorry.

One of the main reasons I love the Imperfect/Perfect Cell saga is because it glorifies a very strong Vegeta in all his stubbornly snooty insufferable greatness before he once again sets himself up to be torn down. [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER] The Final Flash is probably my favorite attack in the entire series, words can't describe the power behind it, it's cool-looking and scary. I've noticed that Vegeta has the best ki attacks of anyone when he thinks it's his last resort (the HUGE red-hot energy ball on Namek that Freeza deflected, the Final Flash, and Final Explosion.)  Vegeta/Trunks vs. Cell is the main focus of Perfect Cell saga, if you like any one of them you will be more than satisfied with this batch of episodes--if you don't mind the cropping, that is :/",1219968000,,1337,4.656779661016949

3122290,5,B00143XE5K,"This season of DBZ brings us to the Perfect and Imperfect Cell Sagas.  Overall, the product is as good as the four seasons before it.  I was a little disappointed paying the same price as the other seasons though for what amounted to be six less episodes than the season before it was.  Actually, each season seems to be getting shorter and shorter.  I know it's because they're trying to stick them into seasons correctly and have it all fit with the season it's being released with...  Still, it would have been nice to knock at least a couple bucks off the price.  Anyway, I still enjoyed it, and it's well worth getting anyway.",1214611200,6,631,4.491228070175438
3122291,3,B00143XE5K,"this season set is as good as the previous sets as far as quality and audio are concerned, but there is one big difference. Funimation go back to their money grubbing ways and from discs 4-6 only add 3 episodes per disc rather then 6. it's still a lot better then 3 eps per single DVD of course but I can imagine Funimation will drag this series out as long as possible. could be a sign of things to come, I wouldn't be surprised to see only 2-3 eps per disc in the next set...",1214006400,2,477,4.031578947368421
3122292,4,B00143XE5K,"This is a great buy finally a cheap way to watch your favorite sagas.  I was disappointed that this set didn't go through the Cell games though and also that they seemed to cheats us a little on this one.  I say this because it is a six disk set cool huh, but wait on the 5th and 6th disk maybe the 4th too I can't remember any way they only put three episodes on them while the other disks have 5 or 6 episodes on them WTF ? sounds to me like they didn't want to stop the next saga mid way through or they wanted to screw us.  Either way this is a great buy !  great quality and just plain awesome try picking up DBZ burst limit on Xbox 360 or Ps3 after watching this and give it a play both are fantastic and complement each other nicely. By the way the episode thing is why I gave it 4 stars not 5.",1213920000,,801,3.8072289156626504
3122293,2,B00143XE5K,"I am very satisfied with other season sets.  But compared to the first 4 seasons, you can tell from the opening theme song that the japanese audio is poorly done.  The opening theme song sounds like it's being played by speakers covered in a heaping pile of blankets (just get some blankets, throw it over your speakers and you should probably get the same sound quality).  As I listened to the opening theme song of what I can vividly describe as the muffles from my neighbors tv down the hall, I had to double check the box, try to google what the heck 'dolby digital 2.0' meant, and whether that was considered worse than mono.

In season 4, I had noticed that the timing for the opening song had also been off (delayed compared to the animation) but this ... there's no excuse for this.. if they had a clean clip of it for 4 seasons, what happened with the fifth?  Whoever reviewed the dvd before it hit the shelves... good job and good luck with your future endeavours..

The japanese dialogue and audio in the episodes are fine.. but it just makes it SEEM like its worse than before, all because of that poor opening sound clip that could have easily been nipped in the bud but it's too late now since it's out on the shelves.. 'no ginger' (translate that literally in japanese and you'll get what i mean)

Of course, if you don't listen to it in Japanese or care for that part.. I guess you're good to go but don't take my word for it because I didn't bother listening to it in English.",1213401600,2,1493,4.348920863309353
3122294,4,B00143XE5K,"It seems that nothing ever seems to slow down for the heroes of Dragon Ball Z even when it is a slow time. Not only is Goku out of commision recovering with 3 killer androids looking for him, but there is another THING out there! It seems that not only good guys can travel back in time and this is where we meet Cell. Cell is a bio-engineered android created from cells of the worlds greatest fighters including Goku and Frieza just to name a couple. Still Cell is not interested in Goku he is looking for the androids 17 and 18 to complete his perfect form and destroy the world. Besides that what else is new? Now its up to Goku to recover and gather his Saiyan brothers Gohan, Trunks and Vegeta because in order to beat Cell they have to become stronger than even a Super Saiyan!

Again this season is just another calm before the next big action packed Saga which is the Cell Games. In season 5 you get alot of important back story on Cell and Trunk to understand a little more about the whole time travel craze that DBZ hooked us up with in Season 4. You also get a little understand of what Android 16 is all about and you will be in for a big surprise. So swallow your pride and be prepared for another prelude to the next huge battle in the world of Dragon Ball Z!",1213228800,,1273,4.17479674796748
3122295,4,B00143XE5K,"My biggest problem with this set is that they felt the need to spread 26 episodes over six discs. Five would have been enough. The last three discs only contain three episodes on each, which isn't really that big a deal, but it kind of puts a damper on marathon viewing.

I was also a bit disappointed to see that, like season 4, the dub had barely been altered. I don't really have a problem with the voice-actors themselves, my main beef is the dialogue. To put it bluntly, it's terrible. Full of cringe-inducing lines that may amuse younger audiences, but not older fans.

Those few minor grievances aside, this is another great installment in the series, and I can't wait for the next one.",1212624000,,693,4.536

The Season 5 box set is shorter than most other releases, only 600 as compaired to 700 with the last releases.  I was exited for this season because I assume that it would the end of the cell games.  Gohan's ascention to SSJ 2 is my favorite part of the series and I am disappointed I have to wait another 4-5 months to wait for anothe dvd release.  That is the reason this is getting a 4 star and not a 5 star.",1211846400,,490,3.919191919191919

3122299,4,B00143XE5K,"I'm actually quite saddened by the fact that the COMPLETE Cell Saga should have been released on this set... One of the DVDs (Disc 5) for example, only has 3 episodes (160-162)... as opposed to the first season's Disc 3 that had SEVEN episodes. FUNimation could have done a lot better and gotten the Cell Saga out of the way the way the Freiza Saga had gotten he full treatment. I'm wondering if this is FUNimation's way of getting the consumer to dish out the cash, or the layout of the disc sets are preplanned this way.
With all said, I do enjoy this saga the most... Vegeta and Trunks are Ascended Saiyans, the nice battle between Piccolo/Kami and Cell. There are a few moments the fighters are sharing their ""moments""... but the fights are great and nothing blown out of proportion the way the Buu Saga have displayed in the early 90s.
I am not basing my ratings on the fact that this is DBZ (the all-time greatest action anime of all time), that this is an original show that relies heavily on fighting, flashbacks, and more fighting... or the simple fact that the video was cropped...

...because that's not the case. Watch it in standard and you'll notice 98% of the footage is there... and 100% of the action is uncensored anyway. So you basically get 100% Dragon Ball... with 70% of the CELL SAGA.

Fortunately for Wal-Mart's dumb employees... I managed to get my copy 2 weeks prior to the release.

In the previews on EXTRAS tab... it is mentioned that SEASON SIX will have over 700 Minutes, and 6 discs. So I will take it that not only the end of the CELL SAGA will come about, but the Great Saiyaman saga as well.",1210809600,,1626,4.449664429530201

If you get only one dbz boxed set this is it. Nothing else matters

I already have it ordered. i'll do that with all of them.

okay the first favorite saga is the freiza saga. ( reason why ) well it has to be the episode (Transformed at last) that is a emotional episode, losing a friend right in front of you. man that's is my favorite part when Goku becomes a SUPER SAIYAN for the first time. But that's not the full reason. this set has the best fight scenes in it.

All Z warriors are my favorite. but my #1 favorite character has to be GOKU!. went through all transformations minus the mystic saiyan.

enough of that.

dragonball z by far the best anime series watched on TV.

The DVD set unfourtunitly ends at the start of the Cell games and doesn't get into any of the actual fighting between Cell and Gohan. Other than that, it's an improperly titled season, do to the fact that there were orionally 8 seasons and the cell saga was season 5, not season 5 and 6. Because if you purchase season 6, which by all rights is the beginning of the Boo saga. The season 6 disc starts off with the Cell Games tournament. Where they made the Boo sage start out with disc 7. Now being a life long, royal fan of DBZ and Funimation, this urks. I personally feel they split these episodes up by the number of episodes so every set had the same number of episodes.

At any rate this is season five and perhaps the darkest chapter of the Z series simply because Cell goes around turning everyone inside out. I just thought he was a disgusting creature and wanted to see him get his just desserts throughout the entire thing. It has a cliff hanger ending with all the Z warriors training to battle Cell.

It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!

Other than that, the marathon feature is  a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf.",1361232000,,675,4.299212598425197

3356746,5,B00143XE5K,"I love DragonBall Z since I was little. To have this collection in my procession is amazing to me because for a long time I couldn't find the shows for DBZ. Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.
Its a WONDERFUL collection. I just love it. If you are a DBZ fan, you must get it!!!!!",1332633600,,1052,4.136585365853659

3356752,4,B00143XE5K,"First of all, there are some very good episodes on this disk. In this season, we are introduced to Cell, and the season consists of him absorbing people to get stronger. Cell is a very creepy villain and he gives DBZ a ""horror movie"" feel. This is the season where Goku gets better, and as the threat of Cell grows stronger, he decides to train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber with Gohan, and Vegeta trains with Trunks. This season really feels like a buildup to season 6, the Cell Games Saga, and that's a good thing, because (without giving the ending away) you get the feeling that the Cell Saga is really heading for an epic conclusion.

As for the actual set, the packaging is nice visually. The remastering process is a bit flawed, unfortunately. Not only has the image been cropped to 16:9 when it is meant to be 4:3 (resulting in some of the top and bottom being cut off), but some of the details on characters is lost from the remastering. The film was put through a machine that not only ate up the grain and dirt, but it took off some of the lines as well. Also, the image can be a bit blurry at times. However, I'd still say that overall it looks good, and this is the best DBZ has ever looked, with the exception of the Dragon Boxes of course. Other flaws with this set is that the Japanese dub is in mono, not stereo, sound. So for fans of the Japanese dub, I would recommend shelling out a bit more cash for the Dragon Boxes instead. Also, if you want to see remastered DBZ looking it's best, buy the Dragon Boxes.

If you're a fan of Bruce Faulconer's music, however, pick these up. The good thing is that these sets give you the option of watching the English dub with the Japanese music (the Dragon Boxes also have that option). The bottom line is, if you're a fan of DBZ who simply wants the episodes, get these for the cheaper price; they're still a very good way to collect the series. If you want DBZ remastered to it's best (and if you don't care about Faulconer's music), get the Dragon Boxes.",1309651200,4,2016,4.316622691292876

Four kinda drags along and extends stuff longer than needs be especially at the end. 5 messes around much less and right from the start. I HATE Cell, which just goes to show that he is a great character and the Z fighters really have their work cut out for them.

3356757,5,B00143XE5K,"The Marathon Feature almost eliminates the old argument of DBZ dragging on too long with nothing happening by eliminating the OP/ED and recaps. Scenes and dialogue are uncut with original Japanese audio. As with all anime purists, I cannot recommend the English audio in any scenario.",1282694400,,284,5.195652173913044
3356758,3,B00143XE5K,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Five DVD box set includes six DVDs that contain twenty-six episodes.  The first two discs contain six episodes, the third disc contains five episodes, the fourth and fifth discs contain three episodes, and the sixth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.

The special features really aren't all that special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which is a feature that was already included on the previous four DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for xxxHolic, Glass Fleet, Black Cat, Fullmetal Alchemist, Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Baki the Grappler, and Samurai 7.

Another issue I have with this set is with the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's opening splash screen, the trailers at the beginning of the DVDs, and the menu were mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes on the discs were mastered with a very soft audio level.  It's rather frustrating to have to sharply turn the volume down when you put the DVD into the player, and then having to sharply turn the audio back up in order to hear the audio for the episodes.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.  This 26-episode set sells for anywhere between $30 and $50.  The price is a little disappointing for this set, since you paid the same price for the previous four sets but you get more episodes on the previous volumes.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1273536000,2,1665,4.606779661016949

I bought the complete collections about 20 days ago. its amazing & awesome. the only problem i had is the English subtitles doesn't work with English 5.1 & 2.0. its only work with the Japanese audio. rather then that every thing else its good. PQ & SQ spicily the Japanese music. Highly recommended",1273363200,,322,4.75
3356760,4,B00143XE5K,"I'll start this review by stating the only thing that really needs to be reiterated, because so many other reviewers get this wrong. The image is not flat out cropped, some is cropped but new picture is also shown just as much. The original transfers were all cropped generally so they could `pan' certain shots across a scene. Therefore you aren't losing as much picture as many reviewers falsely claim. People should really do their research before they pretend to know about something.

Okay, moving on this box set is more of the same. English dubbing with original Japanese music in surround sound, English dubbing with English soundtrack in stereo, and original Japanese mono are the audio choices presented as usual. The redubbing that Funimation had done has mostly stopped by this point. Vegeta and Krillin now use their original audio, and only Dende remains to be redubbed since his VA changed. Some parts of this saga should be redubbed, however. For starters, Master Roshi gives a history lesson on the Red Ribbon Army that is entirely wrong. When Funimation originally dubbed the series they had not yet done Dragon Ball, just the movies. As such it was in the movies that Tao was a General with the Red Ribbon Army character (though it wasn't in the Red Ribbon Army). Roshi's English dub states that Tao was a high ranking general in Red Ribbon. Of course, anybody who's seen dragon ball knows this isn't true, and that Tao was a mercenary hired to kill Goku. They tried to consolidate the movie into the timeline which was well enough all those years ago, but Funi really should've taken the time to fix errors like this.

As for the story itself, the imperfect and perfect Cell Sagas were among the most intense action-packed sequences in the series' history. It starts off with the startling new revelation of another android from the same future Trunks is from who's come back in time in order to absorb the androids and obtain his perfect form before he destroys the world. Piccolo finally merges back with Kami and the two of them prove to be too much for the new genetically engineered android to handle, but Cell manages to elude them all the same. The series slows down a bit as the Z-Fighters pointlessly chase Cell around while the other Androids go on sight-seeing on their way to Goku's house. Finally Goku wakes up and takes the other saiyans Vegeta, Trunks, and his son Gohan to the Lookout. The plan is to use a special room to complete an entire year of training in a single day so that they can achieve a level beyond that of a Super Saiyan.

Everything comes to a head when the other three androids arrive at Roshi's island looking for Goku, and instead find Piccolo waiting for them. The proceeding fight between Piccolo and Android 17 is one of the best in the entire series, but unfortunately is the last really great fight. Both fighters are incredibly powerful and skilled fighters. Their battle is far more dynamic then the simple light shows, excessive transformations, and cheap abilities that would plague the rest of the series. It's also the last time Piccolo manages to be relevant in the series. A bummer for Piccolo fans.

But the fight doesn't stop there, the action continues right up until Cell's arrival. Seeking to absorb the androids, Cell makes short work of both Piccolo and 17 before 16 interferes. The large android has a short, one-sided skirmish with Cell but is unable to stop him from absorbing 17 and transforming. Things start to get somewhat uniform from here. In his new form Cell easily defeats 16 and goes to absorb 18 but is stopped by none other than Tien. In his last moment of relevance, the veteran human fighter almost kills himself using his Tri Beam to restrain Cell while the Androids escape. Both Piccolo and Tien are rescued by Goku, but Cell resumes his quest.

With the androids cornered on an island, Vegeta and Trunks emerge from their training and are ready to face Cell. Vegeta undergoes a new transformation and ascends past the level of Super Saiyan, from there he has a one-sided fight with Cell, but the biological android convinces the saiyan prince to let him absorb 18 and become complete. He does so and after his final transformation to his perfect form, Cell easily defeats Vegeta and Trunks. You see the pattern now? Cell transforms and dominates 16, Vegeta transforms and dominates Cell, Cell transforms again and dominates Vegeta. So on and so on, this is basically how the rest of the series progresses.

Moreso, Cell manages to be a rather cheap villain. While he is very strong, his only attacks are ones he's copied from the other Z-Fighters and previous villains whose genes he's inherited. He has no attacks or fighting style of his own. Vegeta actually manages to hit Cell with his new Final Flash attack that maims the villain but Cell effortlessly regenerates the damage. Even Piccolo needs time and energy to regenerate, and even so he can regrow limbs but cannot repair all the damage done to him. Cell takes his regeneration to newer and cheaper levels. The fight would've ended when Vegeta nailed his attack, but Cell's genetic makeup allows him to survive and thrive. However instead of killing his victims, Cell decides to release them, for the moment.

But as much as I find Cell to be unappealing, it's hard to deny that the nonstop action presented in this saga is pretty epic in anime scale. From the moment the fight between 17 and Piccolo starts, it doesn't end until Cell defeats Trunks after becoming perfect. It spreads across several islands, involves a modest cast of characters, and crosses several tiers of power. This is really the epitome of Dragon Ball Z, lots and lots of action!",1272931200,,5709,4.748991935483871

The Cell imperfect/ perfect sage is a welcome addition to any DBZ collection. Calling Mr. Nature is real name, Mr. Satan, is a welcome relief. Sme goes for the blood that we suspect was there, but didn't see it.
The greatest feature in this collection is the marathon selection option. This is great, you can see one episode after antoher without the end and begining titles! Be warned. You can view a whole disc this way before you know it.

3356766,5,B00143XE5K,"I've been a diehard ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this DVD boxset! Continuing from where the Androids Saga (from the Season Four set) left off, eventually, Trunks and the rest of the good guys find a discarded exoskeleton that Imperfect Cell, another of my favorite villains from the show, and Dr. Gero's greatest creation, had when he was in his larvae form, after coming from Trunks' alternate timeline, and the good guys soon find out that, Cell, with his scorpion-like, needle-like tail, has been absorbing people in cities across the world, trying to absorb Androids 17 and 18 so he can get his perfect form, become Perfect Cell, and rule the world/get rid of all people living in it, so the good guys find and eventually battle against him. Throughout the sagas, Goku becomes affected by the heart virus Trunks told him he was going to get from his saga in the second-to-last saga from the other boxset, he recovers from it eventually, Imperfect Cell absorbs Android 17, becomes his second form, Semi-Perfect Cell, then after a while, absorbs Android 18 and becomes Perfect Cell, and near the end of the Perfect Cell saga, announces his Cell Games Tournament, which leads up to the next boxset, Season 6 (Cell Games Saga). You get all of the episodes from Season Five(Imperfect Cell and Perfect Cell Sagas combined), such as the one before it and ""Piccolo's Folly"", where Piccolo battles against Imperfect Cell and tricks him into telling him where he came from and how Dr. Gero made him so Piccolo can regenerate his arm that Cell had absorbed, the one where Android 16 battles against Cell and Cell absorbs Android 17, and the one where Perfect Cell announces his Cell Games Tournament. The only things that I miss from this boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and that the American music that Bruce Faulconer made isn't there, but the show is still amazing!

3356776,4,B00143XE5K,"One of my favorite episodes in the ""DRAGON BALL Z"" anime series was the Cell saga.  The toughest enemy that the team has fought yet and the series focuses on everyone trying to prevent Cell from absorbing the androids while the Saiyan's Goku and son Gohan and Vegita and his son Trunks (future) train to get stronger, so they can prepare to fight Cell.

With each DVD season box set release of ""DRAGON BALL Z"", as a hardcore fan of the series, it's just incredible to get over 30 episodes for almost the same price or less than most American television box sets.

Season 5 surprisingly in duration wise, shorter than the previous volumes.  Where each DVD had around 5 or more episodes, on disc 4-6, there are only three episodes on each disc.

I was surprised and I have to admit that I would be upset if Funimation did this from here on in but I understand that it's business and with everyone buying these box sets because it's awesome price for a large number of episodes, you can't beat it.  But I'm just hoping that this is not a permanent decision.

VIDEO:

The video looks great on DVD and for those of us who have multi-generation fansubs or fading VHS tapes, just having these episodes on DVD and everything looking great. I know some people have a problem with the show receiving some cropping but for me it's quite miniscule.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features include trailers and open and ending themes. If there was one thing lacking, it's the fact that there are really nothing in terms of special features.

Season 5 ends with a cliffhanger to the upcoming Cell games chapter and at the time of writing this review, Season 6 is now available in retail.

There is a lot of action in this series and no filler episodes.  It's straight mayhem as Cell continues to absorb people and the heroes can do nothing but just hope they can hang on for a day or more while the Saiyans complete their training and hope to defeat Cell.

The Cell series was quite popular back then when I was watching the series in straight Japanese and the whole android storyline was just exciting to watch (especially the special episode in Future Trunks world which pits him and an older Gohan against the evil androids).

Speaking of the special, the special is not included and I assume that they will hopefully release it with the movie collection re-release.  But for those who have never seen it and don't intend to buy it, there is an episode that shows footage from that special.

Overall, Season 5 is a very good box set.  I was put off by the sudden drop of episodes when you reach disc 4 and noticed every disc thereafter only has three episodes.  Again, I hope this is not where the future of the box sets are going.  But with season 6 now available, I guess I'll find out.

Nevertheless, you still get over 20 episodes but after being spoiled with 30 or more episodes per box set, it just sucks to get this drop.  But I understand it's a business decision that probably will work since people are hooked on this DVD box set for its sheer amount of episodes and great price.

All in all, another cool box set release from Funimation, just a bit sour about the drop in episodes though.",1224460800,,3185,4.481802426343155

I do find that 3 discs with 3 episodes is pretty lame, they could've just saved some resources and made 1-2 less discs. This is just in comparison to the road they tread with these DBZ sets. In a wider prespective, think about other anime dvds, most of their dvds are about 3 eps/disc! And their season sets are typically 26 eps! Not THAT big a deal alright guys :)

3356781,4,B00143XE5K,"DBZ is absolutely amazing (in Japanese), if you're here reading this review you don't need me to tell you that. I bought Vol. 1-5 remastered... I can honestly say I won't buy any more of these sets. I really don't like the cropping or the supposed remastering. While the visual quality isn't necessarily HORRIBLE to the naked eye, it is nowhere near as pretty as it's supposed to be (as seen on the official Japanese DVDs). The Japanese audio is also improved on those releases, I really recommend buying some of those if you can afford it.  You will NOT be sorry.

One of the main reasons I love the Imperfect/Perfect Cell saga is because it glorifies a very strong Vegeta in all his stubbornly snooty insufferable greatness before he once again sets himself up to be torn down. [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER] The Final Flash is probably my favorite attack in the entire series, words can't describe the power behind it, it's cool-looking and scary. I've noticed that Vegeta has the best ki attacks of anyone when he thinks it's his last resort (the HUGE red-hot energy ball on Namek that Freeza deflected, the Final Flash, and Final Explosion.)  Vegeta/Trunks vs. Cell is the main focus of Perfect Cell saga, if you like any one of them you will be more than satisfied with this batch of episodes--if you don't mind the cropping, that is :/",1219968000,,1337,4.656779661016949

Actually, each season seems to be getting shorter and shorter.

Either way this is a great buy !  great quality and just plain awesome try picking up DBZ burst limit on Xbox 360 or Ps3 after watching this and give it a play both are fantastic and complement each other nicely.

3356790,2,B00143XE5K,"I am very satisfied with other season sets.  But compared to the first 4 seasons, you can tell from the opening theme song that the japanese audio is poorly done.  The opening theme song sounds like it's being played by speakers covered in a heaping pile of blankets (just get some blankets, throw it over your speakers and you should probably get the same sound quality).  As I listened to the opening theme song of what I can vividly describe as the muffles from my neighbors tv down the hall, I had to double check the box, try to google what the heck 'dolby digital 2.0' meant, and whether that was considered worse than mono.

In season 4, I had noticed that the timing for the opening song had also been off (delayed compared to the animation) but this ... there's no excuse for this.. if they had a clean clip of it for 4 seasons, what happened with the fifth?  Whoever reviewed the dvd before it hit the shelves... good job and good luck with your future endeavours..

The japanese dialogue and audio in the episodes are fine.. but it just makes it SEEM like its worse than before, all because of that poor opening sound clip that could have easily been nipped in the bud but it's too late now since it's out on the shelves.. 'no ginger' (translate that literally in japanese and you'll get what i mean)

Of course, if you don't listen to it in Japanese or care for that part.. I guess you're good to go but don't take my word for it because I didn't bother listening to it in English.",1213401600,2,1493,4.348920863309353
3356791,4,B00143XE5K,"It seems that nothing ever seems to slow down for the heroes of Dragon Ball Z even when it is a slow time. Not only is Goku out of commision recovering with 3 killer androids looking for him, but there is another THING out there! It seems that not only good guys can travel back in time and this is where we meet Cell. Cell is a bio-engineered android created from cells of the worlds greatest fighters including Goku and Frieza just to name a couple. Still Cell is not interested in Goku he is looking for the androids 17 and 18 to complete his perfect form and destroy the world. Besides that what else is new? Now its up to Goku to recover and gather his Saiyan brothers Gohan, Trunks and Vegeta because in order to beat Cell they have to become stronger than even a Super Saiyan!

Again this season is just another calm before the next big action packed Saga which is the Cell Games. In season 5 you get alot of important back story on Cell and Trunk to understand a little more about the whole time travel craze that DBZ hooked us up with in Season 4. You also get a little understand of what Android 16 is all about and you will be in for a big surprise.

I was also a bit disappointed to see that, like season 4, the dub had barely been altered. I don't really have a problem with the voice-actors themselves, my main beef is the dialogue. To put it bluntly, it's terrible. Full of cringe-inducing lines that may amuse younger audiences, but not older fans.

3356796,4,B00143XE5K,"I'm actually quite saddened by the fact that the COMPLETE Cell Saga should have been released on this set... One of the DVDs (Disc 5) for example, only has 3 episodes (160-162)... as opposed to the first season's Disc 3 that had SEVEN episodes. FUNimation could have done a lot better and gotten the Cell Saga out of the way the way the Freiza Saga had gotten he full treatment. I'm wondering if this is FUNimation's way of getting the consumer to dish out the cash, or the layout of the disc sets are preplanned this way.
With all said, I do enjoy this saga the most... Vegeta and Trunks are Ascended Saiyans, the nice battle between Piccolo/Kami and Cell. There are a few moments the fighters are sharing their ""moments""... but the fights are great and nothing blown out of proportion the way the Buu Saga have displayed in the early 90s.
I am not basing my ratings on the fact that this is DBZ (the all-time greatest action anime of all time), that this is an original show that relies heavily on fighting, flashbacks, and more fighting... or the simple fact that the video was cropped...

...because that's not the case. Watch it in standard and you'll notice 98% of the footage is there... and 100% of the action is uncensored anyway. So you basically get 100% Dragon Ball... with 70% of the CELL SAGA.

Fortunately for Wal-Mart's dumb employees... I managed to get my copy 2 weeks prior to the release.

In the previews on EXTRAS tab... it is mentioned that SEASON SIX will have over 700 Minutes, and 6 discs. So I will take it that not only the end of the CELL SAGA will come about, but the Great Saiyaman saga as well.",1210809600,,1626,4.449664429530201
