1084464,5,630587073X,"I decided to revisit H.G. Lewis recently. Not a big deal, actually, although I knew I was in trouble from the start with ""Something Weird"". Since I've already viewed and reviewed all of his horror films, at least the ones that really matter, I suspected I would find little to like with this decidedly non-horror entry. How could a non-horror film from the Godfather of Gore match up to the sinew-ripping atrocities committed in ""Blood Feast,"" ""The Wizard of Gore,"" and ""Gore Gore Girls""? I knew I would never see another tongue pulled out of a woman's mouth, nor would I witness Montag the Magician hypnotizing his audience so he could perform unspeakable acts of gory mayhem on unwitting young ladies. No more faces dipped in a deep fat fryer, no more heads crushed under a car's wheels. Sigh. I really miss the experience of watching an H.G. Lewis gore flick for the first time. I'm hurting over here! Maybe ""Something Weird"" won't be such a bad experience. Maybe I'll see a film overflowing with excellent performances from a talented batch of actors, lavish set pieces, and top-notch direction, lighting, and editing. What am I saying? This is an H.G. Lewis flick! He doesn't know the first thing about movie making!

""Something Weird"" tells the story of an unfortunate wretch named Cronin Mitchell (Tony McCabe). In the opening sequences of the film, we see Mitchell dutifully performing his electrical engineering job as he tries to repair a power line. Tragedy strikes when he receives a jolt of electricity, falls to the ground, and then receives another blast of high voltage to his face from the fallen wire. The movie immediately switches focus at this point to the hospital, where we learn that the accident permanently scarred Cronin's face. On the up side, the electrical discharge gave our hero strong psychic powers. He can read minds and tell the future, traits that come in handy when he starts talking about one of his nurse's private life. Ooops! After Mitchell has a good cry in his hospital room--he isn't happy about his disfigurement, don't you know--he reconciles himself to a life where the best he can hope for is telling people their fortunes for pocket change. It's at this point in the narrative where a nasty looking witch (!) makes Cronin an offer he can't refuse. She promises to restore his face to pre-accident condition in exchange for companionship. Hmmm. Considering the ugliness factor we're dealing with here, it's a tough choice.

Mitchell eventually gives in and strikes the deal. Presto! His face returns to normal, and the witch transforms herself into a strikingly beautiful young lass named Ellen (Elizabeth Lee). It's at this point that the movie starts to become a bit hazy. Cronin tries to bail on his deal with the devil and becomes enmeshed in helping the police hunt down a serial killer. There's also serious nonsense about expunging a ghost from a church. At some point, Ellen/Witch tracks down Mitchell and tries to remind him of their deal. Matters become complicated, however, when one of the cops working with Cronin falls in love with the comely Ellen. Hilarity ensues. Not really, but the movie does treat us to a chase scene that seems to last forever. Remember the foot chase at the end of ""Blood Feast,"" the one that saw Fuad Ramses receive his just rewards in the garbage truck? This chase is sort of like that, except longer and less fruitful. We also see the horrific effects caused by a killer blanket, and a scene in which Mitchell imbibes a significant dose of acid in order to increase his psychic powers. The end.

""Something Weird"" definitely lives up to its name. LSD, ESP, a witch, and a hunt for a serial killer all combine to make a movie that is supremely inept. The acting tanks. Witness Cronin crying into the mirror at the hospital for proof of this assertion. That's the lamest crying I've seen since...well...since that kid cried on the beach in ""Blood Feast"". Then there's the over the top histrionics from the lady that plays the witch. She must have watched ""The Wizard of Oz"" for inspiration and then ran with it. The ham fisted editing and lazy lighting just enhance the general awfulness of the proceedings. I did see a couple of things I liked. One, the pair of lips painted on one of the witch's knees. What in the heck did that mean? It's never explained, but it's a nice touch in an otherwise dreary picture. Two, I had to laugh over the haircuts we see in the movie. Most of the male authority figures look like they're wearing black, molded plastic helmets. The movie achieves this inadvertent effect partly through lousy lighting and partly through lousy film stock. It's hilarious anyway, and it makes the movie look like one of those old educational films from the 1950s.

As one would expect, the Something Weird release of ""Something Weird"" (the company named itself after this very film) has something for everyone. The commentary track is pure gold. H.G. Lewis talks for a few minutes and then turns the floor over to company founder Mike Vraney, who then proceeds to talk about the genesis of his movie empire! It's so comprehensive, informative, and just downright fascinating that we never miss listening to Lewis talk about the film. Too, we get the usual collection of several short features. On this disc and with this movie, that means LSD themed, psychedelic madness in the form of bizarre fare entitled, ""Psyched-Out Singalong with the 4-D Witch!"" Uh huh. The 1960s must have been something to behold. Ultimately, I had a lot of fun watching this disaster. It turns out that I didn't even miss the gore!",1179014400,7,5614,4.790505675954592
1084465,2,630587073X,"Although it has been noted by other reviewers, I just wanted to note how unusual the commentary track is on this disc. For the first 10 minutes, you get a pretty standard HGL play by play. Then, he leaves and the founder of Something Weird Video sits around with David Freidman and a few other (hard to hear) people and discusses the history of the company. They finish their story early, however, so for the last half hour or so, it is all filler! You would think this would be terrible, but in truth it is pretty entertaining. The SW guy actually makes a point to say that the commentaries are usually much more professional than this--right before he gets a phone call from his wife! As far as the movie goes, no nudity, not much violence to speak of, and only really notable for a scene where a man is attacked by his bedsheets. That's pretty brilliant, but the rest is dull. Think of the exposition scenes in Blood Feast, if you need an example...",1167091200,,952,4.4147727272727275
1084466,5,630587073X,"Come on past reviewers!!!

Where is your sense of adventure, and your sense of humor??  This isn't a movie that would win any awards.  This is pure fun!  I've watched it 5 times and still haven't tired of it! It's so bad, it's good! That witch is hilarious!!! What sarcasm, what wit! And the makeup!! She's worth the price of the dvd alone!!!  Loved when she's sitting on the couch laughing at her new lover!!! She has a tattoo of lips below one of her knees! A real 21st century business-woman stuck in the 1960's.  I really want to go drinking with her, bet she'd really put me in my place!!!

I agree that the acting is something out of a high-school production,  I mean, killer bedsheets??!!....this has got to be a stroke of genius, whoever thought of it deserves kudos!  The cheap looking ghost!!! the cheap sets! the bad music! Which reminds me, can anyone tell me if Janet Charlton, who plays the sexy secretary, is the same journalist Janet Charlton from the E channel??  Hmmm, she looks an awful lot like her.  Same name too! I'm very sure she doesn't put this film on her resume!! What a way to start a career! LOL!  Janet you rock, you haven't changed a bit since 1967!

This film is also packed with subliminal messages, moral themes, and extras from the 60's.  It really is dated material, but lots of fun!!

Something Weird is not for all tastes, but give it a try, the used copies here on Amazon are only $3.99. Very affordable. You won't be sorry, I promise!",1107820800,13,1475,4.431226765799257
1084467,4,630587073X,"Okay, where have we heard this before?  A man gets into an accident; when he gets out of the hopital he is gifted with psychic powers.  Later, his powers take him to a small town (in Wisconsin but not really) to try to solve a series of bizzare murders that have the police stumped?
I like to imagine Stephen King saw this movie while in college and forgot about it, then later it grew into the Dead Zone.  But that probably never happened.
I don't know, I like this movie.  You have your psychic, your witch who is beautiful to the world but ugly to her lovers, your serial murderer, your inept police detectives, and LSD.  What could possibly go wrong?
Oh yeah, you even have a ghost.
If you had to take one movie to a desert isle where there's no electricity to run your DVD player (or TV) anyway, you might as well make it this one, because, while it might not have everything, it has quite a bit packed into it.
Buy it now!
The DVD has the usual assortment of delightful extras that Something Weird has accustomed you to.  Plus, the commentary track is the history of Something Weird Video!  There is no way you can pass this DVD up and still look at yourself in the mirror!",1058832000,25,1179,4.283783783783784
1084468,2,630587073X,"I gave this turkey 2 stars because it made it after 36 years to
dvd. Being one of the bit actors-stuntmen in this film (I'm the bad actor blonde thug in the bar scene with those awful lines.),
I would put it on a level just above ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"".
The acting,and cutting left a lot to be desired.
  I did, however, find one thing that might add some redeeming
 value to ""Something Weird"". I loved the ambulance.",1055635200,5,419,4.2784810126582276
1084469,2,630587073X,"First thing,As a big fan of all the Herschell Gordon Lewis films I have found so far,I could barely wait to see this one,it sounded real interesting. Well...it is interesting,and funny. But it does bring a new  meaning to the term ""wooden indian acting""(and sometimes  overacting).It's the story of a guy with ESP and his deal w/a witch to  restore his beauty,and a psycho on the loose...ah what else? Oh yeah  LSD.Anyway it's all a bit of a mess,but fans of this stuff expect that,it's  just not as good as the Blood Trilogy or The Wizard Of Gore. And now to the  rest of the DVD.Something Weird Video usually does a great job w/their H.  G.Lewis special editions,but this time the whole thing is sunk by a LOUSY  adio commentary where Lewis only speaks for about 10 minutes and is brushed  aside so you can here the riveting and terribly recorded story of SW  Video. A total bore. There is some pretty good old cheap short subjects about  acid,but all and all,a letdown for only the most die hard fans.",963619200,14,1004,4.522222222222222

7896677,5,630587073X,"For those with a very limited budget, the following is a recipe for making the movie ""Something Weird.""  Assemble a no-name cast with limited acting abilities, and get the great Herschell Gordon Lewis to direct.  Take LSD, ESP, a witch, a ghost, a murderous blanket, a psycho killer cop (as opposed to a psycho cop killer), and mix them all in a blender.  When everything is blended together, drink a small portion.  Drinking the entire concoction can give you a headache, or even send you on an acid trip.  After ingesting this mind-bending movie, write or call the National Film Preservation Foundation.  Demand that this movie be preserved for study, film education, and exhibition.

7896679,1,630587073X,"Even by HGL standards, this movie is a complete disappointment.  It is all  bad in every respect - it even fails to be amusing in its badness. If by some bizarre magic, one were actually able to consider BLOOD FEAST to be the pinnacle of movie-making, SOMETHING WEIRD would fall at the very bottom.  The basic plot concept has some promise, but the acting throughout sounds as if the actors were reading their lines for the first time after a night of no sleep. In fact, the best thing about this DVD is the cover.  Unfortunately, actress Elizabeth Lee never looks so pretty at any point in the film, not even in the scene from which the cover is taken.  This is mainly the result of horrible, garish makeup, especially around the eyes.  The potential viewer should pull a copy of the cover off the internet and avoid a waste of money and time.

If you are into strange movies from the 60's then you will like it, if not then you will not understand why anyone watches it. It is a dumb but in a good way and does have a B movie plot. This is the movie(and logo and sound effect) that the Something Weird company ripped their logo etc from. It also has a commentary track which is great to listen to Friedman on. There is a related movie called the Psychic that makes a good pairing to watch together. It is explained in the commentary.",1327276800,3,607,3.9836065573770494

7896682,5,630587073X,"Yes the 60s were awesome during which I did not know I was one degree of separation and three thousand miles from the cinematographer of  ""Something Weird"". The film was shot straight to 35 mm in two weeks for $35,000. I concur with Jeffery Leach that the movie has everything but that's not it.

It's the commentary that puts it over the top.  Turn it on and listen to men totally in the moment talking about the movies I watched every summer Saturday - 5 cents when I was a little person. Too bad I can't be in Nova Scotia today and partake in conversation with two of the old movie makers.  One, the first knight of ignorance, the other, the cinematographer of something weird.  I understand one is sailing and the other is returning to Hollywood to the good fight.  It's all flux and movement.  Film is on the way out but not till these cinematographers die. I wish I could have joined them, told some lies, heard some truths, I did what I could - I watched the video.  I recommend you do the same.  At least once turn the COMMENTARY ON.",1287446400,5,1041,4.324742268041237

It's a pretty great movie if you want a laugh; not so great if you're seeking a beard-stroking paranormal flick akin to the X-Files. As usual, Something Weird Video gives us some neat extras and they have thankfully chosen to present their namesake film in widescreen.

Everybody else in the world sees the witch as a pretty woman named Ellen. Mitchell is asked by the police to help stop a killer in the streets.
