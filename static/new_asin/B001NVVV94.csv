8327970,5,B001NVVV94,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Like the first Powerstrike, this has primarily karate moves as the basis of the workout.  Unlike the other workouts, instead of building all the short routines into an overall single routine, this just keeps the short routines separate.  I actually liked this format better than the long routine (I did not have to work as hard to remember the routine in it's entirety.)

This workout has minimal music with a strong beat, is low impact, and emphasizes form.  The music is a great match to the moves which build progressively in complexity, the rather quiet and serious instructor mostly speaks to cue and remind you about form and only gives encouragement to get you past the hardest parts.  So much preferable to the usual cardio workouts with unnatural perma-smiles and constant fillerpeptalk (good job! perfect! good job!)  I can easily see how others may find Ilaria's workouts dull but, for me, this is what I consider a good workout and fun, too.

Coming from a martial arts background, I prefer serious for a martial arts based workout because I feel rather grrrr and need to concentrate on form when I do any martial arts and --- for any workout --- really dislike empty praise for every simple move (I roll my eyes when you get a ""good job!"" for stretching your arm or other routine move.)  So if you prefer the non-stop peppy, smiley workouts, these dvds probably aren't for you.

There are 6 of her instructors plus Ilaria which I think is way too busy and distracting but is not a major detractor from an overall solid workout that makes you work up a decent sweat.  Hands down my favorite instructor.",1289520000,,1670,4.70446735395189
8327971,4,B001NVVV94,"Don't be swayed by the reviewer below who claims that the video is horrible and does not raise the heart rate. I am an advanced exerciser (Cathe Friedrich, Amy Bento and Jari Love make regular appearances in my routines), and although I would not call this routine advanced, it is solid intermediate and can provide anyone with a decent cardiovascular workout.

The reason? It's almost pure kickboxing- you get from this ONLY what you put into it! Perhaps the reviewer below is comparing this workout to the hordes of aeroboxing videos available that have you hopping around and doing jumping jacks to get you into an aerobic zone. In contrast, this workout's intensity is derived solely from the power that YOU put into the moves. It is completely low impact, so you get a good workout by punching and kicking powerfully, squatting deeply, and pivoting into your kicks and punches. There is something very empowering about that, and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Will it top the list of my intense cardio workouts? Definitely not, but I enjoyed doing it, and I found that my heart rate was in its target zone throughout most of the workout. I recommend it to intermediate exercisers in particular, but there's also something there for advanced exercisers. It's a welcome change from the frenetic pace of many advanced kickboxing workouts, in which technique is secondary to intensity.

The criticism I have is that I'm not sure it'll have staying power in the sense that it is repetitive and might get boring if done regularly. But then again, I found the Tae Bo videos much more repetitive and I stuck with those for at least 6 months, so who knows.",1271289600,22,1660,4.7770034843205575
8327972,4,B001NVVV94,The workout itself is fun and makes you work.  I love doing this workout.  My one complaint is that the audio for her voice is no louder than the background music.  It is sometimes really hard to hear what she is saying.  I wish there was an option to turn off the music.,1250985600,3,271,4.056603773584905
8327973,5,B001NVVV94,"i hate cardio & kickboxing videos that rely on jumps - ilaria's routines are great b/c they incorporate great moves w/ great music.  the arms get a workout too, the pace gradually ramps up so that before you know it you're sweating a lot. i'm advanced (cathe, jari - and LALOFIT - really great) & i always put this dvd in when i need dependable cardio.",1241654400,3,352,4.333333333333333
8327974,2,B001NVVV94,This was a horribly boring video that did nothing to raise my heart rate. I can't believe they call this advance.  Even the people in the video looked bored.  I am sad I can't return it.,1239235200,2,186,4.138888888888889
