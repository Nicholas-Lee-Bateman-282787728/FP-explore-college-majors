2750488,2,B000MV9O7C,"I just watched it and the picture/sound are terrible, even making the obvious allowances.  Another company's DVD is said by a reviewer on this site to be superior to this one, so you should take a chance...it certainly can't be worse than this one.",1214265600,4,248,4.636363636363637
2750489,4,B000MV9O7C,"Glorifying The American Girl turned out to be much better than I expected. The acting and dialogue at times weren't the best although the last 30 minutes of the film provides us with a superb idea of what Flo Ziegfeld's stage show must have been like before he was financially ruined in the stock market crash of 1929. Look for some great performances throughout the film from Mary Eaton as Gloria Hughes, Dan Healy as Danny Miller and Edward Crandall as Buddy Moore.

When the action begins, Buddy, Gloria and Barbara (Gloria Shea) work in Heimer's Department store as clerks in the music department. Gloria sings the songs for the sheet music that the store sells; and she's got a crush on Buddy who is very much in love with her. Barbara has hidden feelings for Buddy; but Buddy is too distracted with Gloria to even notice Barbara very much.

At a company picnic, Gloria is noticed by a sleazy unappealing guy named Danny Miller; and they eventually go on the road touring together as a dance duo. This pleases Gloria's pushy stage mother (Sarah Edwards) but Buddy Moore, stuck back at the department store, feels sad that Gloria left him for a show business career. Eventually Gloria gets noticed by one of Ziegfeld's talent scouts and Danny Miller claws his way into Gloria's profits when he signs her to a five year contract--before she finds out that Ziegfeld wants her and not him. Danny's now wealthy for doing nothing but keeping his eye on Gloria to make sure he gets his share of her earnings.

Of course, there's the unfinished business with Barbara and Buddy essentially living the same lives they always did before Gloria left. Barbara is critically injured when a car hits her; and that also creates even more of a mess for all involved.

But this is life, so the plot can still go anywhere from here. Will Gloria make it with Ziegfeld--he has pretty high standards? What happens once Barbara is injured--how does it affect their lives? Will Gloria ever come back to Buddy or will she stay in show business? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the film to find out! One thing I will say, though--you do get the firm message from this film that fame comes at a price.

They note that this is an early ""talkie"" musical; and wow, are they right! The sound quality isn't always so good; and the quality of the print could still use more restoration. However, the camera plays some good tricks; the cinematography is especially outstanding. There are very brief cameos by then New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker, Billie Burke and others as they enter the theater the night of Gloria's opening with the show. Eddie Cantor also does an excellent skit as part of the show.

The DVD has next to nothing in the extras department. You can pick scenes and look at the catalogue of the other movies sold by Alpha Home Entertainment but that's about it.

In short, Glorifying The American Girl is, despite its flaws, a strong example of an early musical filmed just after sound was truly introduced into film. I highly recommend this for film buffs; and classic movie aficionados will appreciate this one, too.",1208908800,34,3131,4.681818181818182
2750490,4,B000MV9O7C,"This DVD (Synergy Entertainment) is a higher-quality version than expected of this public-domain film.  The video is quite crisp for an un-restored film and the audio rings clear.  The film itself is a delight, giving us our only existing opportunity to glimpse an actual Ziegfeld Follies show.  Mary Eaton is delightful in the lead - so beautiful and such a lovely dancer!  Rare footage of the young Eddie Cantor, Helen Morgan and Rudy Vallee as they appeared on stage are gems.  While this is an absolutely no-frills disc, its audio/video quality is quite good and I would definitely recommend it above the slightly cheaper (but always lousy) Alpha Video version.",1201737600,22,665,5.009090909090909
2750491,3,B000MV9O7C,"Two factors drew me into purchasing this product: that this film is an early talkie and Flo Ziegfeld.  The film, like the curate's egg, is good in parts but has problems with long and boring dialogue, especially the speech made by the boss at the firm's outing. That said, it is a very interesting period piece showing life as it was for ordinary people in the late 20s.  There are set pieces towards the end of the film of the Ziegfeld Girls arranged by Flo Ziegfeld himself (which are less spectacular than legend would have one believe) plus a rather over-long sketch by Eddie Cantor, probably hilarious in its day, but which is now very dated. The biggest disappointment of all is that the film is black and white throughout, whereas the opening credits promise the staged scenes in Technicolour. I think that had these colour scenes been restored, the DVD company could have charged that little bit extra and we would have been given a superb window on our cinematic heritage and I, for one,would not have been so stingy on the star rating!",1176336000,6,1045,4.643243243243243
2750492,4,B000MV9O7C,"Just because I gave this movie four stars doesn't mean it will be entertaining to everyone or even most people. Its main value today is to get a rare glimpse at one of the earliest talkie musicals, and also see and hear what a Ziegfeld show might have been like right before the famous showman went broke in the stock market crash of 1929. Florenz Ziegfeld himself actually produced this film, which features his Ziegfeld Follies girls. The movie actually does have a plot of sorts, although its purpose in this film, as in many of the early talkie musicals, is mainly to set up the singing and dancing numbers. This film, though, is unusual in that the plot does actually teach a little unexpected lesson on the price of fame.

The film opens with Gloria, Barbara, and Buddy selling sheet music in a New York City department store. Gloria and Buddy have been sweethearts since childhood, but Gloria wants a career before she settles down. To complicate matters, Barbara is secretly in love with Buddy. A vaudeville hoofer sees Gloria dancing at a store picnic and wants to take her on as a dance partner. They take their act on the road and are spotted by one of Ziegfeld's talent scouts. Back in New York at the audition, the Follies want Gloria but not her partner. Unfortunately for Gloria, though, she signed a five year contract splitting all her earnings with her partner. Gloria becomes the star of Ziegfeld's new show, and this sets up the lavish production numbers of the last third of the film.

The movie contains very brief shots of Irving Berlin, Billie Burke, and NYC Mayor Jimmy Walker, supposedly as they are entering the theatre to see the show. Particularly entertaining in the Ziegfeld production part of the film are performances by Helen Morgan, Rudy Valee, and Eddie Cantor. If you look closely you can spot Johnny Weissmuller wearing nothing but a fig leaf. You have to remember that this film was made before there was any effective production code, so you'll likely be shocked at the revealing nature of some of the costumes in the production numbers. Also, at one point of the film, Gloria's mother actually utters the D-word quite clearly and without any implied effrontery when she is trying to open up her reading glasses. This is a full ten years before such a big deal was made of Rhett Butler using the same word in ""Gone with the Wind"". Unfortunately, although the last third of the film was shot in Technicolor, the DVD version is in black and white. Also, because of the limitations of technology and the age of this film, there are many long shots of the production numbers with the Ziegfeld Follies girls that make it impossible to see the details of the lavish costumes and sets. However, in spite of its flaws, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in this period of history and these very early talkie gems of which so few are remaining in any form.",1174089600,13,2890,4.653620352250489
2750493,5,B000MV9O7C,"This film is available by a number of public domain distributors, and viewers of each say their copy is the best. I have the Alpha copy, and last night I watched it on my flat-screen, HDMI upgraded on my BluRay player, and it too, looks better than average. Of course, the final 34 minutes of the film is still in grainy black-and-white, but this is all we film buffs will get, since there are no plans that I know of to release the restored Technicolor version. The film is of great interest to film buffs as it includes a pretty good idea of a Ziegfeld show, replete with turns by Helen Morgan, Rudy Vallee and Eddie Cantor. The story is a rags-to-riches tale of a sheet music sales girl, who dreams of Ziegfeld glory. In the old days, the popularity of a given song was measured by the number of sheet music copies that were sold, rather than popular recordings sold. There is some good outdoor photography in Central Park, and on the whole, this will be enjoyed by film buffs.

2750496,3,B000MV9O7C,"The original movie included segments in Technicolor. This is the censored version, all B&W, with around 9 minutes of footage cut. Most of the Technicolor footage came during the Follies show portion of the movie, so we not only miss the color, we also miss a lot of the spectacle. Moreover, the existing commercial versions offered on DVD are made from degraded film, not the original masters. As a result, video quality suffers. There is a restored version of the original masters in the archives at UCLA, but to my knowledge, it has not been released commercially. In the meanwhile, this DVD offers a good watch, albeit with less Follies than hoped for.",1354233600,5,655,4.8053097345132745
2750497,4,B000MV9O7C,"During the advent of synchronized sound in movies during the late '20's, Hollywood produced many musical revues showcasing some of the most popular stars of the day. While their entertainment capacity may vary, all of these films serve as valuable historical and cultural time capsules of America's past.

GLORIFYING THE AMERICAN GIRL, a 1929 Paramount release, is notable because it manages to deliver a fairly decent story along with the vintage revue performances. Add the fact that it was produced by the era's greatest showman, Florenz Ziegfeld, and we get a film that's quite representative of its genre. Mary Eaton, a Ziegfeld Follies girl herself, is the featured star and she's not only pretty, but dances well enough too. That same year Eaton appeared in The Marx Brothers' first film, THE COCOANUTS. Other top Ziegfeld stars - Eddie Cantor, Helen Morgan, Rudy Vallee - appear in the final revue portion of the film, and Ziegfeld himself makes a brief appearance with his wife, Billie Burke. Of course, there's plenty of femenine pulchritude on display in order for the film to live up to its title.

For anyone interested in the '20's, Ziegfeld glamour, and that brief, fascinating transitional period from silent to sound films, GLORIFYING THE AMERICAN GIRL will fill the bill. It's well acted in that it captures the typical jargon and attitudes of people from that era. The use of exterior location photography with sound  is also interesting, as this was technically challenging when talkies first came in. I was particularly impressed with the POV shots taken from the front seat of an ambulance speeding through traffic. Again, this is noteworthy because it shows not all early talkies are as static as many historians claim.

So far, the best quality on GLORIFYING THE AMERICAN GIRL is on Synergy Entertainment's DVD-R.  The image is sharp with good contrast and the sound is clear, allowing for the usual imperfections associated with early sound movies. While some sequences were originally shot in two-strip Technicolor, the film is only available in black and white.",1344988800,8,2088,5.093567251461988

Other input indicated maybe as much as 50% performance, but it seemed less than 20%.  And while the remaining non-performance footage was remarkably fine definition - especially for such an old film, the performances themselves were for the most past pretty fuzzy, or washed out by over- or under-exposures of light. So from ""performance"" standpoint it was much less than I was led to believe from other reviews, and less than hoped for. Big disappointment.

I am interested in Ziegfeld and his ""Follies"" and early talking pictures, but this was a tough one to sit through.  I almost never fast-forward through films, but the endless and unfunny ""comedy"" sketch by Eddie Cantor was painful.  Many of the stars/celebrities listed as being in the film only appear for seconds in some newsreel footage of the opening of the 1927 Follies that the filmmakers awkwardly worked into the plot.  Speaking of plot, what begins as a reasonably interesting backstage melodrama, derails about two-thirds of the way through, the rest of the movie suffering from a serious plot shortage.

All the production numbers that were filmed in the early two-color Technicolor process now appear in black and white, and since they were shot for color, are badly over-lit and bleached-out.

Fashion historians will discover a treasure-trove of late 1920's fashions.  The costumes of the ""Follies"" girls would be of great interest to such viewers.  If there are any Rudy Vallee fans out there, you can watch him sing one of his biggest hits, ""Vagabond Lover"", in a manner even more anemic and stiff than you might remember. He looks like he was badly constipated and trying to pass something enormous and hard.

The sound quality of the film is poor - to be expected from a bad print of an early talkie - and left me suffering from ""ear-strain"" after the 93 minute run.

Serious film buffs be warned! Do not make someone who is not into old movies watch this one!  They'll never forgive you!",1286323200,,1696,4.767123287671233
2750506,5,B000MV9O7C,"This nearly l00-year-old film antique from 1929 simply fascinates me on several levels.
My five-star rating isn't really for the production that was filmed under the supervision of legendary stage musical master, Florenz Zeigfeld.
My rating is for the time capsule frozen forever on film when movies were still trying to learn how to cope with the new ""talking"" feature now added to a movie entertainment.
We see the long forgotten Mary Eaton as the big name star, a name unknown today by only the most serious film enthusiast. In reality, she really was Zeigfeld's most celebrated star and beauty in 1929 and is rumored to have been his mistress. She was hired as a threat to the mythical Marilyn Miller, one of the most celebrated musical stars of that era. Off-stage, Miller was found by many to be hard, tough and enjoyed using profanity, although her magical stage charisma appeared to make up for her dark side. Ironically, like Eaton, Miller's stage magic didn' translate into movie sucess. The camera recorded a flat, shrill performer who made a few musical bombs before giving up.
Watching Mary Eaton today and from the distance of over 80 yea rs, it's difficult to understand her celebrity. Her piercing and wavering soprano, her dancing which consists mostly of endless whirls induces yawn from a modern viewer.
She also diplays--as she did in her first movie, 1929's The Coconuts with the Marx Brothers--the distracting penchant of having her eye brows dancing relentlessly whenever she talks. She can barely utter two words without her brows dancing up and down. Various internet sources agree that this movie was such a disastrous bomb that it literally killed Eaton's movie career.
Movie-goers found the glorification of this particular American girl so sordid and grim, that they stayed away by the thousands.
Indeed, the movie is surprisingly dark, cruel and downbeat.
The heroine has a stage mother from hell. We first meet her when she visits her daughter in a music department of a large store and demands spending money. Throughout the movie she snarls at her daughter for not making enough money to support them both ""in style.""
When Eaton is tricked into signing a five-year contract with her unscrupulous dance partner who is aware Mary is wanted by a big name producer, the poor child merely shrugs. She shows no fight at all againt either her mother or skulking partner.
Her dressing rooms are nearly almost shabby and cramped and dimly lit. All the stage scenes have a sweaty, crowded feel. You can almost smell the old perspiration drenched costumes.
As to the production numbers themselve, we watch performers unmoving in tableus, all attired in bizarre costumes--from nuns and Roman gods to party girls.
We're treated to hideous performances by some of the golden entertainers of that era--a languid, nasal Rudy Vallee singing ""Vagabond Lover"" as if he wants to hit the sack. A tremulous, tear-filled Helen Morgan who sobs out her lyrics and suggests that she will soon collapse in a puddle of convulive hyteria. And probably the worst comedy routine ever filmed in those days: a l5-minute comedy routine with Eddie Cantor that stops the show dead in its track and which which would destroy an evening of entertainment for any hapless audience member. The routine goes on minute after long minute and confirms again what a disastrous hand Zeigfeld had in indulging his personal favorites over the interests of movie audiences..
Then there's the weird insertion of a fake radio host greeting 1920s celebrties, who are actually inserted from news reels. We even see Florenz Zeigfield with a woman who isn't his wife, Billie Burke. She probably wouldn't want to sit throughn entertainment that stars his possible mistress.
The much ballyhooed Technicolor sequences do not exist on any of the numerous versions I've seen.
I saw a revival of this movie several years ago in Broadway's wonderful old Regency Theatre and the packed theater was furious that the color sequencs was missing.
My public domain version has a ghostly parade of girls hurrying across the screen in the introduction, as if suggesting that at this time in American history no greater glory could befall a girl than to be picked as one of Zeigfeld's magical beauties.
But as the story points out, if you are selected for the glorification process, expect a dismal payoff.
This is spotighted in the very last shot. When Mary Eaton--who died unknown and forgotten in l948--approaches the edge of the stage, she magically manages to balance the biggest feathered head dress in movie musicals. It cascades high in the sky and foams to her slippers.
Mary Eaton looks out at the applauding crowd--where her former boyfried sits happily with his new little wife, both who had been co-workers of Mary in her music department position.
A strange expression crosses Mary Eaton's face--one of confusion and hurt, or perhaps its a foreboding of what this movie disaster would do to her own life.
For after this megabomb, Mary Eaton vanished forever.",1276905600,2,5033,4.985731272294887
2750507,4,B000MV9O7C,"This DVD will not impress you with the transfer quality.  Indeed, some scenes seem to be pretty well washed out.  The plot is hokey, the leads unbelievable and the song and dance routines are way outdated.  So why the 4-stars?  This is the only film I've heard of with real clips of the original Zigfield Follies.  It's pure Americana, they way we were in the 1920's.  It's well worth the price and time to view the DVD.

All the Zigfield scenes are shot as performed on Broadway and some appear to be the actual live performances (which may explain some of the problems with the quality of the presentation).  The base story concerns a very talented young female performer (Mary Eaton) as she climbs from company picnic dancer to the Follies.  That's the whole plot.  The rest is entertainment.

The cast is a veritable who's who of American musicals of the 20's with Eddie Cantor, Helen Morgan, Rudy Valllee, Irving Berlin, Billie Burke (Flo Ziefeld's real life wife), Johnny ""Tarzan"" Weissmuller and Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. showing up on camera.

Unfortunately, although the last third of the film was shot in Technicolor, the DVD version is in black and white. Also, because of the limitations of technology and the age of this film, there are many long shots of the production numbers with the Ziegfeld Follies girls that make it impossible to see the details of the lavish costumes and sets. However, in spite of its flaws, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in this period of history and these very early talkie gems of which so few are remaining in any form.

There are several other versions of this public domain film floating around. I'd say this is the best version that is commercially available. However, there is a fully restored version - I believe it is at UCLA - that has the Technicolor footage this version does not have.",1238198400,8,2832,4.669338677354709
2750509,1,B000MV9O7C,"The movie starts off promisingly enough, but a few minutes into it, it apparently suddenly occurred to the folks at Reel Classic Films, the manufacturer of this DVD, that maybe a widescreen format is just what this picture needs. So, shortly after the opening credits have rolled, they change the format to widescreen by shrinking the picture and then stretching it across the screen so that the original image is distorted. The movie itself is nothing too special, although it does provide a glimpse of Mary Eaton in one of her few film appearances, in addition to songs from Helen Morgan and Rudy Vallee and a comedy routine featuring Eddie Cantor. Who knows, though? I might have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't been so preoccupied with the problem with the picture. This review concerns the edition of this DVD that comes in the case with a black cover; I see that there's another edtion of the same movie from the same manufacturer that comes in a case with a red cover, and maybe the problem has been corrected on that edition, but I was unable to find a way to contact the manufacturer of this abomination to ask them about the other edition. You'd do well to avoid the black-cover edition like the plague, and it would probably be a good idea to pass on the red-cover edition, too, unless you have some way of knowing how the movie is presented in it.",1233964800,5,1362,4.563265306122449
2750510,5,B000MV9O7C,"Glorifying The American Girl turned out to be much better than I expected. The acting and dialogue at times weren't the best although the last 30 minutes of the film provides us with a superb idea of what Flo Ziegfeld's stage show must have been like before he was financially ruined in the stock market crash of 1929. Look for some great performances throughout the film from Mary Eaton as Gloria Hughes, Dan Healy as Danny Miller and Edward Crandall as Buddy Moore.

When the action begins, Buddy, Gloria and Barbara (Gloria Shea) work in Heimer's Department store as clerks in the music department. Gloria sings the songs for the sheet music that the store sells; and she's got a crush on Buddy who is very much in love with her. Barbara has hidden feelings for Buddy; but Buddy is too distracted with Gloria to even notice Barbara very much.

At a company picnic, Gloria is noticed by a sleazy unappealing guy named Danny Miller; and they eventually go on the road touring together as a dance duo. This pleases Gloria's pushy stage mother (Sarah Edwards) but Buddy Moore, stuck back at the department store, feels sad that Gloria left him for a show business career. Eventually Gloria gets noticed by one of Ziegfeld's talent scouts and Danny Miller claws his way into Gloria's profits when he signs her to a five year contract--before she finds out that Ziegfeld wants her and not him. Danny's now wealthy for doing nothing but keeping his eye on Gloria to make sure he gets his share of her earnings.

Of course, there's the unfinished business with Barbara and Buddy essentially living the same lives they always did before Gloria left. Barbara is critically injured when a car hits her; and that also creates even more of a mess for all involved.

But this is life, so the plot can still go anywhere from here. Will Gloria make it with Ziegfeld--he has pretty high standards? What happens once Barbara is injured--how does it affect their lives? Will Gloria ever come back to Buddy or will she stay in show business? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the film to find out! One thing I will say, though--you do get the firm message from this film that fame comes at a price.

They note that this is an early ""talkie"" musical; and wow, are they right! The sound quality isn't always so good; and the quality of the print could still use more restoration. However, the camera plays some good tricks; the cinematography is especially outstanding. There are very brief cameos by then New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker, Billie Burke and others as they enter the theater the night of Gloria's opening with the show. Eddie Cantor also does an excellent skit as part of the show.

In short, Glorifying The American Girl is, despite its flaws, a strong example of an early musical filmed just after sound was truly introduced into film. I highly recommend this for film buffs; and classic movie aficionados will appreciate this one, too.",1231804800,4,2956,4.696911196911197
2750511,3,B000MV9O7C,"Gloria Hughes (played by Mary Easton), our glorified girl herein, perseveres through this film, going from a gal singing sheet music in a department store to a leading dancer on the stage. Just before she goes on at her biggest venue thus far she runs into Eddie Cantor backstage. Cantor tells her, ""Don't be scared now. You'll make good. I was frightened a little too when I first came with Ziegfeld , but I'm over it now. Besides, they're a great audience. I've got all my relatives out there, and a few gentiles, too. Now, go after it kid. You'll make good."" Then she goes and dances, but, as a viewer, one is more interested as to when Cantor himself is going to perform in this film, than in paying much attention to Gloria's dancing. There frankly isn't much in this ""film"" to hold one's interest. I used the quotes just now because this ""film"" is less a story than a vaudeville show of various performances. Helen Morgan and Rudy Vallee, who both have nothing to do with anything herein, do songs, for instance. A lot of what we see, actually, has the look, moreover, of ""Movietone News,"" as if we are watching snippets of various doings that aren't really connected to one another---a Ziegfeld show, you could say, but then I'd argue that the ""story"" herein just gets in the way.

Finally, just before the last scene, we get Eddie Cantor. A portly guy and Eddie Cantor are working a suit store. A sap walks in and they go into their routine.
Cantor to the sap: ""Don't listen to him, he's a damn fool.""
Cantor's partner: ""Don't you tell anyone I'm a damn fool.""
Cantor: ""I didn't know it was a secret.""

This goes on for almost 12 minutes
Partner: ""This is what I call a hunting suit, the finest hunting suit I've ever seen.""
Sap: ""A hunting suit? Why do you call it a hunting suit?""
Cantor: ""We've been hunting for the pants for two years.""

The scene is funny, but has absolutely no relevance to anything preceding, yet when it's over one is tempted to wish nothing will follow it either since it's the highlight of ""Glorifying the American Girl."" Gloria had a beau at the department store, but neither her nor him had any money. When she went on the road her guy began to feel he was being left behind and began seeing another gal. The two of them are in the audience during the final scene. The guy says to his new wife, speaking of the show, also called ""Glorifying the American Girl"": ""You're glorified."" To which she answers, ""Not glorified, but happy."" A final shot of our star makes it evident that such is a position Gloria would have preferred to be in herself.",1214524800,,2579,4.471337579617835

8173003,5,B000MV9O7C,"I was in the midst of reading 'The Days We Danced' by Doris Eaton Travis, when I thought to do a search of amazon prime video to find a film with an Eaton (of the 7 Eatons, the showbiz family). I was surprised to find this one excellent film starring Mary. Doris, the author of the 'Days' book wrote so much about Mary in the book. And now, here she was - along with Texas Guinan (Doris wrote about her also), Flo Ziegfeld (Doris wrote about him, of course!) and other celebrities of the time.

The plot may be thin for this film but the pace is brisk and the actors perform well. Mary DOES pirouette nicely, as mentioned in Doris' book. The costumes and musical productions are as lavish as you imagine they would be. This authentic look at a Follies-type production beats the technicolor glamour of 'Funny Girl' by a country mile!

I read 'The Ziegfelds' Girl' by Patricia Ziegfeld (Stephenson) before Doris' book. I can't recommend that book highly enough, although it is really about growing up a Ziegfeld, not so much about the show business aspect of life with a Ziegfeld. Ziegfeld was not Jewish, I was have been surprised to learn - a surprise as great as finding out George M. Cohan was not Jewish (I guess I thought the name 'Cohan' was pretty close to 'Cohen' and there the confusion lies... - both men were baptized in the Roman Catholic Church and came from that religious background.)

The Cohans and the Eatons have something in common: they were families with children 'hoofing' it on the stage almost as soon as they could walk. And living the tough show biz life of traveling the vaudeville circuit, going from big town to small town, living in one rented room or apartment or even boarding houses. Who's the ringleader of this circus? Mom! Just as the mother in this film guides her daughter, supports her, counsels her, and takes part of her money.

Doris' book about growing up Eaton is fascinating. Working all night dancing in a speakeasy, dancing on the stage during the day, throwing money into the family money fund used to pay everyone's rent and feed the family - you see this could easily have been the history of the character Gloria played by Mary Eaton in this film.
