2793590,5,B000OCXLQO,"I love Peter O'Toole and after his recent death decided to watch one of his films.  This one was an excellent choice and Im
glad I purchased it because I will watch it again and again very likely.  A moving story will very human characters.. sometimes
disturbing, then next moment beautifully touching and emotionally charged at times.  Great flick",1387411200,,348,4.864406779661017
2793591,5,B000OCXLQO,"One of the best films about men's fascination with women. Peter O'Toole is outstanding, and he is just a hair better then the supporting cast.",1384732800,3,142,4.72
2793592,4,B000OCXLQO,"Peter O'Toole is an old actor who hangs out with his old-actor friends, making what they can of their days while awaiting the inevitable when his best friend's teenage grandniece (a convincing Leslie Phillips) comes to stay.  His age seems to preclude a full dirty-old-man moment, but O'Toole's character is taken with her in a not-entirely-pure way.  She, in turn,  is cold and distant, disrespectful, ignorant, self-centered and mean.  Otherwise things are fine, and O'Toole lavishes attention on her.  We are on our way to a poignant ending, but we must first endure his almost repellant physical affection for her and her truly nasty and manipulative responses.  O'Toole and his buddies are a joy to watch.  The story is quite original and interest never flags.  So, if you can overcome the slight queasy factor, this is a good flick.",1377216000,2,838,4.9784172661870505
