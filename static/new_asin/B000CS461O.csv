2472646,4,B000CS461O,"This History Channel produced documentary provides a nice, overall view behind the scenes at one of the world's most popular tourist attractions, Walt Disney World.

For those who have watched these specials before, there are going to be a number of things presented that you're already familiar with. The history on Walt Disney's purchase of the Florida land is here along with the building of Magic Kingdom, as well as construction on the other three parks: EPCOT Center, Disney-MGM Studios, and Animal Kingdom.

The documentary does go underground to show you the underground tunnel system used by cast members and park management that keeps the show running above. You see the control room that ensures the functions of many popular attractions such as The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean.

A nice attribute to this documentary is how it shows the inner workings of WDW's famous daily parades. While seemingly simple, you get a taste of how these parades are, in and of themselves, a technological wonder.

You're also treated to a limited first look at Expedition Everest and the first free walking animatronic, Lucky the Walking Dinosaur. If you were unable to see this invention at Animal Kingdom last year, you can get a taste for the amazing piece of work this animatronic is (so amazing that it was featured in Time Magazine as one of the best inventions of 2003).

All in all, this DVD is a great way to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of the resort with a lot of new (as well as some old) material for Disney fans.",1139011200,87,1552,4.819548872180451

I tried messing with settings on my PS3 but that's just the way it was released. It's Where the picture is right in middle of screen but only takes up half of it or so. I have no idea as to why anyone would think this is a good idea. Normally I would curse a lot and return it. It was so interesting that I had just dealt with it.

2472711,5,B000CS461O,"I'm a HUGE roller coaster and theme-park fan, so shows like this instantly capture my attention.  ""Modern Marvels"" is the best show on the History Channel (in my humble opinion), and this episode doesn't disappoint.  It takes you through the construction of the Magic Kingdom up to the most current WDW park, Disney's Animal Kingdom.  While it can't take a super in-depth look at all of the parks and their attractions, it gives a wonderful ""behind-the-scenes"" peek at some of the most popular attractions at the resort, as well as how they were made.  I would have loved to get a closer look at the ""Test Track"" and ""Mission:  Space"" attractions at EPCOT, but they just didn't have the time.

Top-notch.  Very enjoyable program and VERY-VERY ""rewatchable!""",1356739200,,757,4.913385826771654

It also goes into the planning and financial considerations, the Disney philosophy of how to treat visitors to the theme parks, and the things they learned from the limitations found in Disneyland.

2472717,5,B000CS461O,"Yes, I think Disney World is one of 7 wonders of the world. The place is incredible and I'm even more impressed since getting the behind the scenes look I got in this documentary.

It begins with a brief history of Walt Disney himself and his vision for Disney World. They get into the impact his passing had on the efforts. It was his brother and the team he had assembled who decided they could see the dream through to completion.

The documentary then takes the time to go through each of the four major parks: Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom. It was fascinating to see the development and the inner workings of some of my favorite attractions and rides like the Rock n' Roller Coaster and the Tower of Terror. Of course, at the time this documentary was filmed, Everest was still under construction. If you haven't been on it, it's an awesome ride.

You will be fascinated by the underground tunnel system, the animatronics, and the  whole host of other things that go into the inner workings of Disney. Definitely an interesting time, especially for this Disney fan.",1303516800,,1100,4.683937823834197

We visit the Disney World parks about 2 times a year and know quite a bit about Walt and the parks. However, there is always more to learn.  My 13 yo daughter is a treasure trove of Disney trivia and she adores this dvd. It has a nice overall view of Walt and how he got started in movies as well as starting Disneyland, then it moves on to Disney World, it's planning and building and running.

I love the theme parks, though the only 1 I have ever been to is the 1st & the original Disneyland.  I always want to watch any program about any of the Disney theme parks/resorts.

This program is very interesting.  Filmed when Everest was being built.

At 100 minutes you do get to see a lot of different items.  More varied featuring of the attractions should have been done.  They just center on a few attractions.

Disneyland is mentioned/referenced/shown several times in this program.  So, I have this question-where is the Disneyland version of Modern Marvels?

The kids, ages 7,9,11, and 13 were totally amazed at the information presented.  They were intrigued by the behind the scenes look at the place they will be visiting and now have a much better appreciation for Walt Disney, his vision, and the imagineers and engineers that made it possible for them to have an awesome experience on vacation.  I extracted words from the video to compile a spelling/vocabulary list for the kids.  At the end of the week, they made a one hour presentation to their parents about what they had learned.  I was AMAZED.  I would highly recommend this for anyone (child or adult)who will be going to or who has already visited Disney.

Aside from that technical glitch, it is a wonderful look into an amazing place.  It has all sorts of interviews with original designers, technicians and executives about the planning, design and unique attributes about all the old and new attractions.

I lent my copy to my best mate who was there in 1994 and he's so excited, he's plannning to come with us next year.
Basically, whether you're a Disney fanatic (like me) or not, this documentary provides spellbinding viewing.  When you see the effort and imagination that goes into making this one of the most visited places on the planet, you can't help but want to experience it.

Besides showing images from rides that are not on Disney DVDs, they present much information about the construction of the parks and the backstage of WDW. The DVD presents everything in a chronological order, separated according to the theme parks and it includes the uptodate information, like the Expedition Everest ride.

It's a pity not having subtitles. But I really recommend it.",1169769600,2,417,5.043478260869565

I have passed it along to friends to see as well since the information was exceptional.  I would recommend it to anyone who has been to Disney as well as to those who have not been.",1168300800,,302,4.0
2472741,4,B000CS461O,"I rated this only four stars because the audio track on my DVD was out of sync with the video.  It appears that the film to DVD transfer didn't compensate for the film audio being several frames ahead of the images.

On the other hand I now have images of the Utilidors.  I managed to take two backstage tours of Walt Disney World during the 1990's.  The Keys to the Kingdom tour and the three-park Backstage Magic tour were expensive and took up an entire day--but I thought them worth the trouble and expense.  It took me three years to book the Backstage Magic tour, and for several good reasons I didn't get to take home photographs of the backstage areas such as the Utilidors.  Modern Marvels provided me video images to keep these vital infrastructure of Walt's utopian village fresh in my mind.

I learned about the new Expedition Everest ride, and how the Tree of Life was grown by the Imagineers.  I love the Monorail system and the Contemporary Resort--featured!  This DVD lets me tour Walt Disney World and its secrets in the comfort of my home, without flying cross-country and putting up with crowds.  It isn't ""the real thing,"" but this DVD allows me to scratch my Walt Disney World itch until I get the time and a couple of thousand dollars to return to Orlando.",1160438400,23,1278,4.541484716157205

2472744,5,B000CS461O,"With not even being a big theme park fan, I found this program to be SO interesting.  I actually saw it on TV but am now buying the DVD as a gift.  It is fascinating to see Disneyland and Disney World come to life and all the thought and creativity that produced it.  Anyone who has that curious streak and always ponders ""How'd they do that?"" or ""I wonder how that works??""  will LOVE this show.. it is SO COOL!

8101670,5,B000CS461O,This shares the history of Walt Disney and his desire to create an amusement park to allow people to physically enter an animated-type existence. He creates Disney Land then secretly buys up land in Florida to create more but his plans are stopped by his passing. Eventually others continue with his ideas and this shows the massive amount of effort put into creating a make believe world as it examines each of the four different parks. Insightful. Made me want to visit. A good promotional product.,1492905600,,500,4.825581395348837

8101674,5,B000CS461O,"Very entertaining extra-length episode of Modern Marvels.  Gives the story of Walt's insistence on correcting the ""flaws"" at Disneyworld in a bigger, better version.  Also goes into great length on the construction of the parks, from (below) the ground up.  Also touches on some of the more popular attractions within the parks.  One caveat: bear in mind that this episode is over ten years old now, and anything built since then will not be seen.  In fact, the ""new, coming attraction"" was Expedition Everest when this came out.

So if you are a Disney fan, I'd say this is a must-buy.  If you are interested in how the premiere theme park was constructed, it's also a must-buy.",1483833600,4,679,4.752136752136752
