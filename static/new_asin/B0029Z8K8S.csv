8358597,5,B0029Z8K8S,"Terrific video of a very young, vulnerable Elvis in his first year of real fame.  It was shot in the mid 1950's, in black and white,  but even as old as these films were, I was shocked at how talented he was and hypnotic to watch.  He simply stepped out on a stage, no frills, no special effects,  and  started singing with that deep, snake-charming voice, that he never lost from the  beginning to the  end of his life.

I was stunned by how  dangerously beautiful and raw he was back then.  Yet he was sweetly  gawky and didn't know what to do with his hands.  Those smoldering good  looks of his made up for any lack of stage experience.  He twitched a little, threw the crowd that shy,  crooked smile and the women went wild.

With a few wardrobe tweaks, the Elvis in these films could walk out on any global stage today, 2017  and knock 'em dead!  This is a real keepsake for any Elvis fan....a little bittersweet, such a long view into the distant past....but well worth having.",1508716800,,984,4.342541436464089

8358602,5,B0029Z8K8S,"He was young, he was thin, and he was good. The recording lacked a lot as did the video, but considering when they were made they were all right!",1359244800,4,145,4.0344827586206895
8358603,5,B0029Z8K8S,"As I grew up, I remember watching most of these performances as they aired, enough in 1956 to ask for a record player w/Elvis records and a guitar. For those that are so time-burdened that they have no time to watch the full shows (also available on DVD), this DVD of just the songs that Elvis did on the Sullivan show is great. One can see, over his three appearances, that Elvis was maturing from his ""rougher"" look to that of a sauve and extremely handsome young man, whose vocal talents were getting better all the time. All Elvis fans will love this DVD.",1352592000,2,559,4.384615384615385
