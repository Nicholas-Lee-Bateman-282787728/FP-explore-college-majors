6262031,5,B00IF0KASY,"Ten movies from Bob Hope's prime period: 1938 to 1949.
They were made by Paramount, whose pre-1950 catalog is now owned by Universal.
All titles have been previously released. Some as long ago as 2002.
Five of these films were in the expensive ""Thanks for the Memories"" box set - sold by Turner Classic Movies.
The appeal of this new box is the low price.
Nothing to sneeze at.

1)The Cat and the Canary
2) Ghost Breakers
3) My Favorite Blonde
4) The Paleface
5) Sorrowful Jones
6) Thanks for the Memory
7) Give me A Sailor
8) Never Say Die
9) Caught in the Draft
10) Nothing But the Truth

The last five ttitles are not on quite the same level  as the first five, but ""Thanks for the Memory"" has one of my all-time favorite movie moments:
I can't help crying at the end of the film when Bob Hope and Shirley Ross sing the title song. *
Sigh....

Missing from this collection are the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby Road Pictures (1941-53), the greatest comedy series of all time. We are still waiting for all six films to be released in a nice boxed set here in the U.S. (its available in the UK - check the Comment by A. Roberts dated April 10, 2014).
The first four are available inexpensively:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bob-Hope-and-Bing-Crosby-Road-to-Comedy-Collection/dp/B008M4C1BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road to Comedy Collection</a>
- for the convoluted history of these films on DVD, read my review of that set, ""How to Buy the First 4 Road Pictures"", dated June 2, 2013.
Films five and six cost a bit more:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bob-Hope-Collection-The-Lemon-Drop-Kid-Road-to-Bali-Road-to-Rio-My-Favorite-Brunette-The-Seven-Little-Foys/dp/B0042FUHV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bob Hope Collection (The Lemon Drop Kid / Road to Bali / Road to Rio / My Favorite Brunette / The Seven Little Foys)</a>

There are additional Bob Hope movies from this era worth investigating.

Sadly, Casanova's Big Night was Hope's last really satisfactory film comedy. He was basically going through the motions in his later films.
Nevertheless a wonderful body of work from 1938 to 1955

* Bob Hope and Shirley Ross actually introduced 'Thanks for the Memory' in the previous year's ""Big Broadcast of 1938"" (thanks to LA MovieGuy for reminding me).
I shed a tear when they sang it in ""Thanks for the Memory"".
I sobbed uncontrollably when they sang it in ""Big Broadcast of 1938"".
Composed by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin.
Its on You Tube video: ""Thanks for the Memory""

So, thanks for the memory
And strictly entre-nous, darling how are you?
And how are all the little dreams that never did come true?
Awfully glad I met you, cheerio, and toodle-oo

And thank you so much.",1396224000,64,5107,7.209339774557166

The ten movies are spread out over four single-sided discs with all of the bonus material showing up on the fourth disc. All ten films are in full frame format (1.33:1) and subtitles are available in English. Here's the full breakdown:

Disc 1
Give Me a Sailor (1938, black-and-white, 1 hr. 17 min., IMDB rating 6.9)
Thanks for the Memory (1939, Black-and-white, 1 hr. 18 min., IMDB rating 6.7)

""Entertaining the Troops"" (2001, color & black-and-white, 6 min. 20 sec.) - This is a brief documentary on Hope's involvement in entertaining the troops, focusing primarily on WWII. The film is narrated by Richard Grodens who wrote the book ""The Spirit of Bob Hope."" Phyllis Diller also makes some onscreen commentary.
""Command Performance 1944"" (black-and-white, 6 min. 48 sec.) - During WWII, these shows were filmed and recorded in Hollywood and then sent overseas to be aired for servicemen in the field. This is not a full show, but it does include a routine with Hope and Lana Turner where they grill a porterhouse steak for the enjoyment of the troops. (Meat WAS, after all, being rationed and this was one of the requests sent in to the producers of the program.)
""Command Performance 1945 (black-and-white, 5 min. 6 sec.) - This segment includes a routine with Hope's longtime sidekick Jerry Colonna.
""Hollywood Victory Caravan"" (1944, black-and-white, 19 min. 45 sec.) - The plot of this short feature involves a young lady trying to get on a train to visit her wounded brother. It is essentially a promotional film to encourage Americans to by War Bonds. The film includes appearances by Barbara Stanwyck, Alan Ladd, Bing Crosby, Humphrey Bogart, and (of course) Bob Hope, among others.

6262140,5,B00IF0KASY,"The first 5 are not very funny, but good non the less. The 6th with him in the service is hilarious. Martha Raye in the first and third movie is wonderful. She is just amazing. Though, she is better in the first as an ugly duckling in love with someone whom she can't have, not knowing she is really in love with the someone helping her to get the one she can't have. Movies 4 and 5 have similar themes. They both take place in supposedly haunted out of the way house/castle. Both are good, just not very funny. There are racist overtones from the time period in both 5 and 6. Movie 5 has an african american actor you may recognize from a Charlie Chan film (not Birmingham Brown, but Chattanooga Brown played by Willie Best), he plays a controversial role and part, racist by todays' standards. Bob Hope lands in mud in the 6th and makes a racist(by todays' standards) joke.  I will update this after I have seen the rest of the films. Willie Best is in the 7th film as well. He is funny, but again stereotypical for African Americans by today's standards. The 7th film is a great film in which Bobs character bets 10 grand of someone else's money that he will not tell a lie for 24 hours. Well, of course the fun begins after that. The next 24 hours are filled with schemes, and foibles, and what not. It's a great film, I just wish that it was more politically correct. So far, the movies I have seen are good, but not so funny, but more like comedy/drama or dramady's films. The 8th represents what Bob Hope does best, the comical genius that is Bob Hope. Here is a spy thriller, comedy. Hope is accidentally dragged into a situation with a beautiful blond involving spies, microfilm, well you get the gist. He ends up wanted for a murder he did not commit, with spies all around trying to kill him. And then there's the penguin, part of his act on the stage he was performing on, when the spy entered his life. That penguin gets more laughs than Hope in this comedy. You see him in a tuxedo, pajamas, etc. If for no other reason, you should buy this set for this movie alone. The ninth was a true surprise, a true classic, and in color. The 9th is Paleface, yes you read this correctly, the original Paleface is in this set. In Paleface, Hope is a dentist from the east who gets caught up in a situation with Calamity Jane played by Jane Russel. The show is not only good, it's funny. This movie alone makes the set worth the price. The tenth and last movie has Hope with Lucille Ball, Hope plays a bookie and the title role. Here he is a money hungry person who cares for nothing but money. Enter a little girl into his life, add Lucy and you have quite a movie. And, who knew that Lucy could sing? I sure didn't. The movie is more of a dramedy than a comedy. Hope is out of place in this environment and just doesn't fit the role. Still all and all, the movie is a good entry into the set and enjoyable in it's own rite. Remember this set also has Paleface.  Imagine getting Paleface and 9 other Bob Hope movies for under $20, along with extras. What a bargain. All in All, I would say this set is a steal, but lets stay honest, stealing will get you into trouble. My advice buy it before the sellers realize what a gem they have and raise the price.

6262142,3,B00IF0KASY,"Good to finally get CAT AND THE CANARY and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH on dvd.  These, because of rights problems, were not in the initial rush of Hope films to be released to home video. They  were on tv, briefly in the the 90s, but then disappeared, until they showed up, fairly recently,  in an  anthology of other films, which any Hope fan would have already purchased earlier, in a too expensive composite set. This time, those two, and another rarity, the pretty minor, unfunny, THANKS FOR THE MEMORY, showed up, mixed with a seven older, already released, titles, but  at a most attractive price. Apparently, Universal is redistributing a lot of it classic comedy sets (WC FIELDS, the ""ROAD' pictures) in different packaging, at far better prices.  The two rare items are most enjoyable, while things like GHOST BREAKERS, MY FAVORITE BLONDE, CAUGHT IN THE DRAFT and THE PALEFACE still are fun. The other three are ok, too.",1406505600,20,923,4.773584905660377

6262147,4,B00IF0KASY,"When most people think of Bob Hope and the Golden age, they think of his ""Road"" movies that he made with being Crosby, and while those are consistently good, this collection of 10 movies actually show him at his best with a variety of wonderful leading ladies, namely Martha Raye (""Give me a Sailor,"" ""Never Say Die""),  Paulette Goddard, (""The Cat and the Canary,"" ""The Ghost Breakers,"" and ""Nothing But the Truth""), Jane Russell (""The Paleface"") and Lucille Ball (""Sorrowfull Jones"").

With each movie, you can almost hear the movie executive thinking, ""Establish a pretense and let Hope run with it,"" e.g. ""Hope and others in haunted house await the reading of an eccentric relative's will,"" for ""The Ghost Breakers.""

Several of the movies, like ""The Ghost Breakers"" will seem familar because the plots have been used often, but seldom were those made since as funny.

These movies are Bob Hope at his best when he was ""king""  of radio. If I was to rate the movies individually, I'd give 8 of them a 4 out of 4 Star rating and 2 of them a 3 out of 4 Star rating, but which got which might change, depending on my mood the day I watched them.

If you are a Bob Hope fan, or know one, this collection of movies is one you, or they, will really enjoy.",1402272000,2,1251,4.464912280701754
