8733550,1,B015GUL732,"Fixed camera images with no audio. The ""lava flows"" is just like staring at dirt.",1503187200,,81,4.466666666666667

8733552,4,B015GUL732,"This a great DVD. I play it at my dual screen computer at work. There are only two things I don't like: 1. There is no option to loop your favorite scene (the waterfall is my favorite), and 2. I don't find the lava field relaxing and it's not appealing to my eye. Other than that, I'm please with the DVD.",1468368000,7,305,4.016393442622951

8733554,5,B015GUL732,"I work long stressful hours, so wanted to break the habit of coming home and switching on the TV for company. Have a big HDTV, so TV is a blank canvas in the middle of my apartment. Bought the relaxing and calming video to fill that canvas, and create some tranquility. Initial impression...outstanding video. Indeed calming, beautifully filmed and fit for purpose as an audio background for meditation, or just a nice visual to accompany a glass of wine. Will be buying more.",1447027200,13,476,4.746987951807229
