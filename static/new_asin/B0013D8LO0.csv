8250012,5,B0013D8LO0,"Dallas has 5 Seasons left to release on DVD, after Season 9 is released this July.  As I said before, Dallas Season 10 (1986-1987), would be a perfect DVD release this December.  Season 10 introduced a character named April Stevens, so why not release Dallas Season 11 (1987-1988) Sometime in April 2009, in honor of her name?  I hope Warner Bros. agrees with that idea.",1213747200,,370,4.661538461538462
