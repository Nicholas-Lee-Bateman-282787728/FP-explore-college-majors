A thoughtfully written family drama, there are a lot of 4 letter words in the first 5 minutes or so, but then that tapers off and we get to know this farmer and his two almost grown boys trying to keep a farm going in rural Nebraska in the late 90s/early 2000.  Kind of like ""The River"" or ""Tex"" or even ""August: Osage County"".  It's a good one to rent with the hubby if you're looking for a decent flick to watch.",1400889600,,499,4.123711340206185

That I've seen Anson mount who plays (Tully Coats Jr) in this film, always does a excellent job. I never watched very many Indy movies before but, I have began to grow a more liking for them.

1882570,4,B00009AV8C,"This coming-of-age film about two young bucks and their dad on a foreclosed farm hits a nail on the head. Directed
with simple eloquence and finely-acted, the film contains a parallel theme of young love, sealed by loss. A youthful
Anson Mount (Hell On Wheels) holds the title role, and is perfectly cast as the cocky, gods-gift-to-backseat-girls,
and his flipside, the stoic and troubled heir to a failing farm business. Julianne Nicholson lights up the screen as
the ingenuous girl-next-farm-over. This quiet little film will continue to break hearts and stand the test of time.",1366934400,,580,5.11578947368421

the bright and shining star in the constellation of obscure, savagely underated movies. One watches this movie again and again
as though stealing away from a noisy bar room crowd to gaze and savor the starlit skies. It deserves a poem. So let me translate how the Russian poet,TYUTCHEV
would put it in dear, dear MEMORY of Tully senior, "" Watch this movie and be silent.
  Be still and hide yourself,
  And conceal your feelings and your dreams.
  Let them rise and set in the depths of your soul,
  Silently like stars in the night.
  Contemplate them with admiration and be silent.
  How will the heart express itself?
  How will another understand you?
  Will he understand what it is you live by?

  A thought spoken is almost a lie;
  By stirring the springs you will cloud them.
  Drink of them and be silent.

  Know how to live within yourself:
  There is within your soul a whole universe
  Of mysterious and unexpressed thoughts;
  They will be drowned by the noise without,
  Even daylight will drive them away;
  Listen to their singing and be still.",1356739200,,1185,4.58252427184466

1882579,5,B00009AV8C,"Ignore the one star and two star reviews - the one guy was looking for nudity and the others wanted a fast pace...life is not a video game.  I found this movie thoughful in its pace and outlook.  I think it helps to be a deep person or at least thoguhtful one.  If you are just skimming along the surface of life caught up in the distractions that a consumer society excells at and woried about what color your cell phone is then skip this movie or on second thought maybe not - it might be nice to be reminded why we are all here...

Here's my review:
If you are tired of what passes for thoughtful, introspective, heartfelt movie making, tired of the shoot em up or same old same old situation comedies or dramadies, if you want a movie to remind you what exactly character development and movie making is supposed to be about, if you have an attention span more than a nanosecond, if you like the slow unfolding of life and love then I highly recommend this movie. If you don't like any of the aforementioned you quit reading a few syllables ago.

Julianne Nicholson is the moral center of this movie and I can not gush enough about her role, what the writers wrote for her and her delivery. The story centers on a father and his two sons and their Nebraska life on a farm, in a small town. There is something at the root of all of us when it comes to living off the land something in the DNA that just connects. Its part of our being. Careful not to romanticize that reality Tully distills the feeling and the mood and wraps it all up in simple truth and the complexities that can be fall us all. How you deal with what life throws at you is after all the journey. I just loved the last scene, line and shot of the movie.

This is a good one - I loved it the first time I saw it years ago in 2000 and yet again a decade later last week. It's rare that I watch movies more than once.",1286928000,,1886,4.125340599455041
1882580,5,B00009AV8C,"Neither high budget action adventure film nor overwrought melodrama, ""Tully"" is just your basic well-directed small movie that will leave discerning folks with the feeling that the viewing experience was time well spent.

Think ""East of Eden""; with a father (Bob Burrus) who has still not gotten over the wife who walked away from the family years ago, and a pair of unmarried sons.  The James Dean part goes to Anson Mount who plays the title character Tully Coates Jr. (maybe, I suppose the title could refer to Tully Coates, Sr.).  The two title characters operate a Nebraska farm with the help of younger brother Earl (Glenn Fitzgerald).  The Abra role goes to Julianne Nicholson who plays Ella Smalley, a veterinary student home for the summer.

The harsher Cain and Abel elements are somewhat filed down as Ella starts out as Earl's best friend; he is sincerely protective as she and Tully Jr. tentatively produce romantic sparks.  There is only mild tension between the three men during the story.

""Tully"" at its most basic is a coming-of-age story for Mount's character and probably my favorite on-screen romance.  Best scene for us film language nuts is when Ella discovers some dirt on her face after getting into Tully's car and discretely wipes it off; nonverbally telling us more than could have been communicated in several pages of dialogue.

Tully Sr.'s financial problems provide the main side story, which meanders around, occasionally touching the main story, until both storylines intersect at the end.  Unlike a lot of parallel storylines, these two have a nice unity, as the tentative progress of the romance is a nice match for the elliptical way in which the side story is slowly revealed.

Tully Jr. is the local rou, hard for girls to resist and not inclined to resist the opportunities that come his way.  And apparently until this summer Ella has merely been bemused by her friend's brother, even asking him early in the film: ""What's it like to drive women crazy?"" But then director Hilary Birmingham begins to subtly show Ella picking up on a deeper side of Tully at the same time that he is discovering a vague dissatisfaction with his shallow conquests.

The supporting performances are excellent and nicely complement the three main roles.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1259712000,,2321,4.900255754475704
1882581,4,B00009AV8C,"The Coates family owns a small farm somewhere in rural Nebraska.  Oldest son Tully (Anson Mount) is a bit of a lothario and is currently involved with an older woman who strips for a living (she calls it ""burlesque dancing"").  His younger brother, Earl (Glenn Fitzgerald), is a bit more naive and impressionable.  Their father, Tully Sr. (Bob Burrus), is an emotionally repressed man who was tasked with raising his two young sons following the death of his wife in a car accident.  When their father receives notice that a lien has been placed against their farm, their world begins to unravel and long suppressed family secrets come forth.

""Tully"" is the kind of small indie gem that makes the genre so worthwhile.  I was expecting a likeable film, but I was surprised by the emotional wallop it packs. Despite its small scale, the film tells a story that's universal, focusing on how the lack of communication between family members can be so devastating.  Although the main plotline could take place anywhere, setting it on a Midwest farm greatly strengthens the emotional impact of the story by grounding the story and preventing it from spinning into melodrama.  Based on a short story by Tom McNeal, ""Tully"" is a film that takes its time, and some viewers may be bored by the molasses-paced plotline.  However, patient viewers will be greatly rewarded.  Indeed, the small details help make ""Tully"" such a pleasure, such as the flirtatious relationship between Tully Sr. and the grocery clerk.  Every scene rings true, even when the storyline starts to become a bit too much.

To date, director Hilary Birmingham has not made another film, which is a real loss, as she is in full command of this story and her actors.  The film was nominated for Best Feature at the Independent Spirit Awards, along with ""The Good Girl,"" ""Lovely & Amazing,"" ""Secretary,"" and eventual winner ""Far from Heaven.""  Although it's the least known of these nominees, ""Tully"" can more than hold it's own in this field of fine indie films.  Finally, I should note that the DVD box, which makes the movie look like some kind of crime thriller, is just terrible and does not reflect what the movies is like.",1242000000,,2186,4.807486631016043
1882582,5,B00009AV8C,"I wonder if this ever showed up in theaters? It's a very well done coming of age drama with a cast of unknowns who make the best of an intelligent script. No shooting. No violence. Two brothers knock heads, discover uncomfortable details about their pasts and it's all set in a dreamy farmscape somewhere in the midwest. Emminently entertaining.",1234396800,,345,4.864406779661017
1882583,4,B00009AV8C,"A perfectly put together film about love and growing up. Tully Jr sees love as an endless series of sexual trysts. He learns that there is way more to love than this.  Among the many beauties of this tale is the contrast between the free-spirit mom and the boring, trudging dad. Most Hollywood tales, encouraging us to follow our hearts and put ourselves first, never show the broken lives, crushed dreams, and shatttered relationships all too often left behind. But in Tully we see that love is not genetic, not something that happens to us, or something we fall in to, but spiritual, a choice made and honored. The painful difference between those who love others and those who love themeselves is exquisitely done. This is a film that had to be set in the Heartland; no one in Hollywood believes any of this stuff.

Well done in every respect. See it.",1210550400,,854,4.6118421052631575
1882584,5,B00009AV8C,"Probably the single most important reason that a drama fails is because the actors are unable to adequately express the appropriate emotions.  Therefore, it is truly a delight to find a movie with such fitting and intensely expressed emotions.  Maybe I should add that I watch as many as thirty to thirty-five movies a week when I am working on my book at my cottage, and it is extremely rare for me to find a movie where I have to put everything aside to watch a movie.  The feeling in Tully is so intense that I was transfixed, almost hypnotized, by what was happening on screen.

The film had not gone very far when I told my wife that Tully, Sr. was the most believable farmer I'd ever seen on screen.  I know that he acted with the Actor's Theater of Louisville, KY for fifteen years, but I still think he must have spent quite a bit of time farming for real!  I grew up in the hog capital of the world in Illinois, surrounded by relatives and friends who were farmers, and he would have blended in with any group of old farmers discussing their crops and 'the old days.'  His emotions in the scene where he finds out the truth about his long-gone wife is so real one has to wonder if it didn't really happen to him!  For that scene alone it is worth watching the movie.

Of course, the movie is about the younger Tully.  The expressed relationship between him and his father, his brother, and Ella is also extremely believable.  All these younger generation actors are also extremely gifted in expressing the appropriate emotions at the proper times.  Indeed, this whole movie should be seen by aspiring actors to observe outstanding expressions of emotions.

If there is anything I would consider negative about the movie, one would be that I didn't find Tully's 'arms-length' sexual affair with the town slut to add anything to the story.  A second one would be when Tully began to realize the truth and Ella went to him to offer him a sympathetic and understanding ear, instead of having a serious talk they end up with their clothes off in the back of his car.  It would have been more appropriate for Ella to let Tully know she was interested in him sexually, but that then was not the appropriate time.  Also, there is a modest amount of coarse language that wasn't really necessary.  These are minor drawbacks, however, in an otherwise outstanding movie.

To conclude, it you are interested in fast-paced action films, pass this one by.  But, it you can appreciate the slower life of the Midwest farming country, this is a realistic portrayal of that life.  No matter how idyllic such a life looks from the outside, this movie shows that life's twists and turns affect farmers just as much as anyone else.  And, it does it with such an accurate depiction of the emotions involved that you'll probably wish you could be there to offer your advice and support.",1208131200,,2871,4.557504873294347
1882585,4,B00009AV8C,"Life for a father (Bob Burrus) and his two sons (Anson Mount and Glenn Fitzgerald) on their Nebraska farm is disrupted by an unexpected foreclosure notice that causes the opening of family secrets concerning the absent mother.  This quiet but powerful drama has a deliberate pace that matches the long, slow summer days and nights of a rural community.  Deceptively uneventful on the surface, the film seethes with repressed emotion underneath, and the end is heartbreaking.  A cast of unknowns make these honest, hard-working characters into people that you could expect to meet on the street.",1198108800,,594,5.166666666666667

1882600,2,B00009AV8C,"This indie movie about two brothers in a rural landscape has a couple of interesting elements (competent acting, solid direction, worthwhile characters) but ultimately it suffers from an average and rushed plot that doesn`t make this cinematic experience work all that well. I still think that Hilary Birmingham is a director to watch, since her first film is still a decent and meritory effort, yet one hopes that her next work will show a bit more energy and courage.

This story line of mid-western farm people from a vague time period, I'm guessing the late 1980's or mid-90's, is well developed. We care about young stud Tully,his dorky brother, and weather beaten dad. The farm is in danger from a mysterious debt and Tully is gradually falling for the freckled good-girl neighbor back from vet school. These are people that work. How many movies are about real people that work? No detectives or super-models here, no; these are rural folks that honky-tonk on a Saturday night and swim in the local water hole with their girlfriends, or make love down a lonely road on top of the hood of a 82 Cadillac.

Art-film from beginning to end, this soft-spoken story comes alive and envelopes you in the realities of small town life. There are no ""villians"" or ""Heroes"" and the story has nowhere to go other than to chronical the lives of these people for a short time. It is so easy to care for these people.
  Afterwards, I took another friend to go see it as an ""emergency movie"" to a tiny little theater in Berkley (the only place that was still showing it, 48 miles away). After the film he stood up and said ""That was pure quality.""

1882607,4,B00009AV8C,"Based on my memory of reviews when this film was first released, I expected a kind of comedy-drama-romance, which it is not. It can best be described as a family melodrama, set on a small farm in Nebraska (actually shot in the rural community of Ft. Calhoun, near Omaha). The elements are somewhat familiar: an older man raising two sons, of somewhat different temperaments, all haunted by the memory of a mother who had aspirations beyond the narrow confines of the farm (she names a horse Jackie, after Jackie Kennedy, because she ""liked famous people""). During a summer, as the boys have grown into young men, the truth of their mother's past begins to make itself known, and all are deeply affected.
The story has a leisurely pace as it unfolds, and for a time it seems to be about the growing attraction between womanizer Tully and Ella, a college-educated friend of his younger brother. But this becomes a thread in the larger story of a family's secrets and loyalties surfacing after years of silence and half-truths. For its length, it's a small film, and its strength is not in big effects, sex and nudity, or heavy plotting. Instead there are well-acted scenes between people in muted conflict who struggle with emotions and the difficulty of trusting others with the truth about themselves. This will not be everyone's idea of entertainment, but as indie movies go, I found that it rewarded my patience.
The cinematography captures the deep greens of mid-summer, and scenes are often shot in early morning or late afternoon, so the golden, glancing sunlight lights characters with a rich glow and casts cool shadows. Night scenes are played against a textured fabric of insect sounds. Always the camera captures the isolation and solitude of country living.
Perhaps the only real ring of inaccuracy in the film is the fact that so little of the dawn-to-dusk work of actual farming is reflected in the lives of the characters. These boys have an awful lot of time on their hands; the farm seems to take care of itself. The film is based on a story by writer Tom McNeal, whose novel ""Goodnight, Nebraska"" has similar characters (a young couple), a rural small town setting, and touches on similar themes. For fans of the film, I recommend McNeal's book.",1058313600,,2262,4.817480719794345
1882608,5,B00009AV8C,"Tully (Anson Mount) and his brother Earl (Glenn Fitzgerald) live and work on their family farm with their Father (Bob Burrus), their Mother having died when the boys were children. While Tully is an outgoing, sometimes overbearing, ladies' man, Earl is introverted, shy and often the object of his brother's teasing. When their Father receives a foreclosure notice from a collection agency over money that he didn't know that he owed, a series of events are set into motion that change the relationship between Father and sons and bring the family's past into the forefront of their present lives. The tension created by old secrets and new problems causes Tully to abandon his womanizing ways and puerile demeanor and seek the friendship of Ella (Julianne Nicholson), a young woman who is a good friend of Earl's. Ella's friends fear for her feelings when she becomes friendly with Tully, and Tully himself tries to drive Ella away when he realizes that he has strong feelings for her at the same time he must deal with family crises. But Ella and Tully fall in love in spite of these things and cope together when an unexpected tragedy brings an end to the family's crisis.

""Tully""'s quiet tone and measured pace beautifully reflect the midwestern landscape which is not only the setting for this film, but often seems to be a character in it as well. It would be accurate to say that the pace of this film is slow. But its leisurely pace is deliberately and meticulously crafted, and it never drags or bores. The family crises in ""Tully"" could easily be construed as the stuff of melodramas, but there isn't a bit of melodrama in this film. The characters seem so real that you might think to reach out and touch them, and they cope with revelations that strike at the heart of their self-images the way that level-headed people do: Mostly privately, quietly and effectively. I cannot praise director Hilary Birmingham, cinematographer John Foster, and the principal actors enough for being able to sustain ""Tully""'s even, quiet lyricism throughout the film. Impeccable pacing, exquisite cinematography, an excellent script, and great understated performances, so rarely seen together, combine to make ""Tully"" a true gem of a film. I expected this to be a decent midwestern drama, which inspires limited enthusiasm. But it turned out to be one of the best films of 2002. (It was actually made in 2000.) ""Tully"" isn't a movie for those who like their films frenetically-paced, but it is a beautiful film with astonishingly good and touchingly subdued performances. I look forward to future projects from director Hilary Birmingham and this excellent cast.

Note: On the VHS version of this film, there is a short film entitled ""The Third Date"" that precedes the main feature. It takes place on Coney Island, features a cameo appearance by Sandra Bernhard and has no relation to ""Tully"". Don't think that you have the wrong tape if, at first, you see ""The Third Date"".",1057881600,,2970,4.90258449304175
1882609,2,B00009AV8C,"My wife brought this home from the video store on a whim after hearing on TV that Roger Ebert liked it. To each of us, however, this was boring and slow and slow and boring. An arty film in which every single camera shot or scene seems to last too long. One of the sons has sex twice with a trampy but pretty girl, and twice with a nice but less attractive partner. No steamy love on screen, however. We join them only when the action is over, and most clothes are back on. This is the kind of script that could have benefitted from nudity and sexual content. It is a downer, and for some movie fans, any film that's not a downer isn't really ""art."" If you are like that, perhaps you will like this. I think the director may have some talent but needs a better sense of pace and action.",1056844800,,786,4.1103896103896105
1882610,5,B00009AV8C,"The acting in this movie is excellent. Understated but poignant. It is one of those ""first"" movies that reveal the exceptional talent of the director. Julianne Nicholson and Anson Mount give particularly heartfelt performances. It is about feelings that lie below the surface in relationships. It is about people learning and growing. It is slow paced but so is the life it depicts. But when the secrets start to unravel you feel a rush of emotion along with the characters.
Don't let this small movie get lost in the shuffle. Watch it and cherish its beautiful simplicity.",1056585600,,573,4.917525773195877
1882611,5,B00009AV8C,"This tale of two brothers and their father on a farm in the summer is deceptively simple.  Their relationships with each other and others in the small town work themselves out as they should, but with a number of surprises along the way.  Cast with total unknowns, each says far more with a facial expression or shoulder  than with words.  I cared about these people and their lives and I think you would too.  Enjoy.",1056153600,,417,4.506666666666667
1882612,5,B00009AV8C,"Hilary Birmingham makes a stirring directorial debut in this realistic, family drama, which I rank, next to Billy Elliot and In the Bedroom, as among the best. The characters are both believable and three-dimensional as they try to work through their tremendous character flaws to find what they are each searching for; and down to the last line Birmingham displays an amazing understanding of human nature. It won the Audience Award for Best Director and Critics Award at the 2000 Los Angeles Film Festival, Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2000 Newport International Film Festival, and Audience Award for Best Feature at the 2000 Gen Art Film Festival. Like the films I compared it to, Tully takes a few hours to sink in before you realize how deeply moving it is, but this long overdue release belongs in every great film library.",1054598400,,849,4.902777777777778

7990455,5,B00009AV8C,"[Rounded up from 4-1/2 stars]  I love when little movies surprise you that you know were made on a shoestring budget but still restore your faith in great movie-making.  I had never heard of this movie about two brothers living with their Dad on a Nebraska farm (and a female friend from their childhood who's come back to town and can't decide who she loves), growing up without their Mom, and the secret that'll turn everyone's lives upside down, with an ending that packs an emotional wallop that you won't see coming and would even make a grown man cry. Stars Anson Mount (TV's ""Hell on Wheels"") and Glenn Fitzgerald as the brothers (and Natalie Canerday, who played that boy's Mom in ""Sling Blade,"" has a supporting role). Filmed in 1999 in Nebraska, Iowa, and Massachusetts, released in 2000, with an oh-so-sweet little ode to ""Misty Blue"" by Dorothy Moore and discernibly pleasant background sounds from the countryside.  This one is extra special and very highly recommended! [I just wondered why the brothers and Dad wore Levi's jeans and not the more typical Wrangler's for the setting, and, to note, the DVD transfer leaves something to be desired, resembling VHS.]",1472342400,,1176,4.87
