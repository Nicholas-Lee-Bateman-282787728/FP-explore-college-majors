4104316,5,B003AOB41C,"I've waited a long time for Invader ZIM to show up on an affordable box set. Nickelodeon, I believe, released it on DVD to go along with the March special they were having on TV and it was a very smart move. I know my friend and I both took advantage of the opprotunity to purchase this DVD without hesitation. It is compact (no huge box to keep disks together) and exactly what a true ZIM fan needs. I recommend anyone with a fetish for green, red-eyed aliens who have a desire to destroy Earth to go ahead and get their hands on the two DVD sets!",1273190400,3,548,4.130841121495327
4104317,4,B003AOB41C,Great picture and quality but sadly missing sound some in a small part of one episode and has no special features.,1273104000,5,114,4.476190476190476

4104319,2,B003AOB41C,"The latest in a long line of attempts to cash in on the Invader Zim license, it seem like these DVD sets omit many of the great special features included in the initial DVD's that garnered the fan base they have now.  Invader Zim is a quirky, dark cartoon that never got a fair shake from Nickelodeon because of shows like Rugrats clogging up the airwaves.  Anyone who's wandered into a Hot Topic in the past few years knows what a cash-cow Viacom missed out on by cutting this series short.  That being said, these DVD's don't do the show justice. Do yourself a favor, and track down the initial three volume DVD release (used) to enjoy all the extras, commentaries, and animatics for episodes that were never completed.",1271030400,42,721,4.573643410852713
4104320,5,B003AOB41C,"I love this show!!!!! I am so glad that they started to put the episodes back in production and make the old episode available again on DVD! These are of DVR quality (which is recorded) but you can't tell the difference. Sure its not as great as the complete box set, but its better than nothing! I would recommend to anyone who is searching for the episodes at an affordable price. Buy this you filthy humans! Also available is season two! Buy both or face your doom!",1270252800,4,468,4.390804597701149

Buying this kind of immortalizes it. Share it with others to change their lives ;)",1460851200,,174,4.645161290322581
4104328,5,B003AOB41C,"I am a fan of Invader Zim from way back when it first aired.  I had the original release of the DVD's but one disc was lost in moving.  (I think the ex ended up with it somehow)  Finally getting around to replacing it, I purchased this set.  They episodes are all there.  They play just fine with no issues.",1458777600,5,307,4.05

4104331,5,B003AOB41C,"A classic, morbid cartoon from my childhood. Bought this for my brother who still loves to watch this at 20 years old--we even watch it together with my mother sometimes, who now thinks Gir is the cutest thing! Lol",1456099200,2,214,4.512820512820513

4104335,5,B003AOB41C,Loved it since I got it and now all my childhood memories are back. But some episodes have the intro/outro song with the credits cut off if some of you care about that. Personally I don't but that could possibly be the only down side to this dvd. Still 100% worth the buy!,1442707200,,272,4.150943396226415

Just wish Zim and his slightly manic robotic side-kick were still on the air, lets all sing the doom song!!!

Doom doom doom, doom doom doom . . . etc.

4104338,5,B003AOB41C,"This is great to add to my collection! The show is hillarious and well written. Definately a dark comedy, with an excellent script, memorable characters, fun music, and who doesn't love Gir?

4104344,5,B003AOB41C,"DVDs all look to be in new condition as promised, package still shrinkwrapped, good sign.  Arrived sooner than anything else I ordered at the same time!  Seller's return policy seemed very accommodating - not that I think I'll be needing it - and was printed out in plain English on the packing slip.  I miss this weird little alien guy spazzing out on TV, I'm excited to have him back in my living room!

""'You can't make me look! I'll just shut my eyes.'
'Oh, you'll open them. You have to breath sometime.'""",1393027200,9,510,4.451612903225806
4104345,4,B003AOB41C,"The cartoon was amazing because it was DIFFERENT! That's what made it loved by all.  I've loved it since ever and am somewhat disappointed with the reviews stating how crappy the ""commentary"" or ""special features"" are in this version.  But that's not why anyone loves Invader Zim.  They love it because of the charm, the characters, because you can root for Zim and Dib simultaneously yet still want neither to win.  The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of the first episodes creeped me out for all eternity.  Zim tears a child's eyes out (only shadows are shown on camera) and replaces them with new ones that will make the kid not like Zim anymore.  Instead the child is brought into a false sense of reality and believes a squirrel is Zim and the episode ends with the kid climbing up a vertical wall exorcist style climbing up chasing the Zim squirrel.  If you have small kids, let them watch the hell out of this show.  Just make sure that they can understand the humor and ridiculousness and watch the episodes beforehand to make sure that they aren't the one I just described.  The episode is in vol. 1 so everything else after that is GOLD!!!  Trust me, any kid will get psychologically damaged at some point in their life.  Why not let Zim handle it?  He knows the sweet spot to damage their brain to the point where they will make random references to it randomly but not so much to make them Dib-crazy.  They will grow up knowing the difference between STUPID myths and LESS STUPID myths.  Like aliens and Bigfoot.

FYI almost this entire review was a reference to Invader Zim so buy the thing, watch ALL OF THE EPISODES EVER!!! Then come back so you can appreciate my review.",1390003200,,1721,4.488745980707395

4104350,2,B003AOB41C,"The show is great and entertaining.
This review is specifically about the poor quality of the actual product received. The DVD's skip, get stuck and pixilate. I'd recomend buying from another source. Maybe other copies were better. Wish we'd found out and returned within the return window but didn't think to try them immediately upon getting them to check for quality. Disappointed. Go find the originals instead or if you don't care about DVD ownership you can watch these episodes on Amazon On Demand for a lot less and hopefully better quality.

8393074,2,B003AOB41C,"The show is fantastic and worth watching. It is perfect for those who like dark humor (organ harvesting being a frequently used example). Well thought out, often times plain silly humor.

This being said, there needs to be a Blu Ray version of the show. DVDs are terrible quality, and there are a large number of visual artifacts during screen panning and motion of objects in general.",1511827200,2,385,4.746268656716418

Wonderfully awful, if those two words could ever go together, is the best way to describe this show. It's worth a watch if you like disurbingly funny things.",1501718400,,302,4.826923076923077
