8535462,5,B00798MA2W,"Can you imagine being told that your only grandchild would be born with only ""half a heart""? That's the message I received 20 weeks before our little Emma was born. Her condition, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, was something our family had never even heard of, but it meant that Emma had only a slight chance of survival. Our education about congenital heart diseases began that day.

Those who watch ""SILENT CRIES"" can follow Emma and her parents, as well as other CHD families, as they deal with their newborns' heart diseases. Viewers can also encourage federal funding for the completion of the ""Silent Cries"" project. We grandparents are selfish in asking you to share Emma's story with us. Why? Our selfishness is in wanting to keep our granddaughter alive, and her future remains uncertain. More research is needed now if the little babies born with ""half a heart"" but ""twice the fight"" are to survive long-term.

Emma's cries were indeed silent as she lay in a hospital crib on a vent for months, struggling for each breath. But thanks to research and dedicated physicians, Emma laughs aloud today. Please help us keep that laughter alive!",1333324800,10,1149,4.887179487179488
