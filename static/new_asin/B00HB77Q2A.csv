8631473,4,B00HB77Q2A,"Just finished watching ""Fujimi Orchestra: Cold Front Conductor"" released on DVD by Ariztical Entertainment.
""Fujimi Orchestra: Cold Front Conductor"" was adapted from the top selling YAOI manga novels - or so says the DVD cover, and there is indeed a series of manga novels which chronicles this ""interesting"" love[?] triangle which centers on violinst and concert master Yuki Morimura, conductor Kei Tonoin, and principal flautist, Natsuko Kawashima.
While I was watching this live-action movie, I kept thinking of a conversation Mom and I had nearly fifteen years ago when the Boy Scout scandal began making the rounds in the national news. Mom asked me if anything like that had ever happened to me when I was a Boy Scout. ""There was a hand ax in reach and I used it to prevent anything from happening,"" I replied. [Note: the sorry SOB who tired to rape me when I was 12-years-old committed suicide two weeks later.]
""Why didn't you tell me,"" Mom asked. She was upset. ""Because you and Dad would have killed him and I never would have become an Eagle Scout,"" I told her.
Mom was visibly shaken and upset by my answer. She remembered that I had lied about my pants being torn by my bicycle chain.
So the question of ""What would you do to fulfill your dream?"" kept running through my mind as I watched ""Fujimi Orchestra: Cold Front Conductor.""
Avoid wanting to have a young woman such as Natsuko Kawashima in any part of your life, is the answer that best comes to mind.
Poor Yuki is deeply in love with Natsuko. He composes and plays a simply beautiful and lovely violin sonta in her honor; but has yet to play it for her. Despite never having even been on a first date with her, he does buy for her, but doesn't give, an engagement/wedding ring combination.
Both Yuki and Natsuko play for the amateur Fujimi Orchestra.
Enter professional conductor Kei - who loves no one until he hears Yuki playing in the park one night.
Kei falls deeply in love with Yuki, and Yuki has absolutely no clue.
Kei volunteers his services to the amateur Fujimi Orchestra, and naturally, Natsuko falls in love with him and asks him out, much to Yuki's devastation.
Here's where it gets interesting. Kei confesses to Natsuko that he's gay and is love with Yuki. Natsuko understands and then proceeds on a plan to help Kei get Yuki alone because ""its better to be loved by someone than have no love at all."" Interesting sentiment when she confesses later that she knew Yuki loved her, but she doesn't love him.
Guys and gals, if there's anyone like this in your life, run far, far away from them.
In true YAOI fashion, Kei eventually rapes Yuki as a Wagner CD is playing in the background. Yes, the rape and it's aftermath is shown. It turns out that Natsuko is happy that Kei raped Yuki because Yuki has found someone to love him. [With friends like her....]
Yuki suffers from what I call Luke-Laura syndrome: ""You raped me! I hate you! But I can't stop thinking and dreaming about being in your arms....""
So what will Yuki do next? Will he report what Kei did? Will he continue to try to win Natsuko's love? Or will he put the experience behind him in order to become a professional musician?
Reluctantly recommended because it's an extemely well done magna adaptation.
Four stars.",1392336000,2,3262,4.625862068965517
