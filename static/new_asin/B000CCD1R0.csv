8096985,3,B000CCD1R0,"Camara Oscura (2003) is a Spanish production, with English subtitles.  The title translates as 'deadly cargo', which is rather ambiguous for this film, that sets up an interesting and suspenseful premise, then turns very dark and confusing, before going completely overboard in the last act.  At the conclusion, you may have been entertained, but you could be a little unclear about what you have seen.

In Senegal, Sara (Silke) a journalist, and tourists Victor (Adria Collado) and his pregnant wife Thais (Diana Lazaro), board a small boat for a scuba diving tour.  The crew consists of Edgar (Andres Gertrudix), Ivan (Unax Ugalde), and Drui (Mustafa Jawara), a young boy.  While far out at sea, the group find a body floating in the water and haul it aboard.  Through an idiotic accident, the boat explodes, leaving everyone treading water, approximately six hours from the nearest land.  As night falls, they spot a ship and swim towards it, but as they approach, they witness a man being murdered, and his body tossed into the sea.

They survivors, crawl up at the bow of the ship, and sneak down below to hide in the hold.  It's a tense and scary situation, and the group remains in hiding, until Thais is bitten by a rat, and Sara and Victor go up top to look for medical supplies.  While prowling around, they find the crew's quarters, but before they can get back to hiding, Victor is spotted by one of the crew.

Since Victor was the only one seen, he decides to turn himself in, to protect the others.  He is taken by the crew to meet the Captain (Lluis Homar).  Victor is carrying a transceiver radio with him, so those in the hold can hear what is happening, when the crew start to question him and then beat him.

The first half is quite well done.  They action is fast paced, and the film is atmospheric, with a high level of tension.  It is a scary situation that escalates to violence, but the story starts to unravel a bit soon after the crew comes into the picture.  Precisely what is happening on the ship is hard to fathom, as the crew is keeping secrets from the Captain, a man with a moral compass, that swings quite wildly.

Certain things are baffling, like risking safety to treat a rat bite.  The radio ploy is clearly insane, but is highly effective as a dramatic tool.  Somehow it remains undiscovered, and later still works after being submerged.  Damn good electronics.  Sara the journalist, has a mania to take photos at the most dangerous of times.  Her camera must be waterproof, and capable of shooting in extremely low light, with a short fixed lens.  Photography is rarely portrayed accurately in films, and this one is no exception.

The ship is huge, yet everyone keeps passing by the same set of cabins, for most of the film.  The ship's cargo seems to be exotic animals, including primates and snakes, but the crew seem to have little to do, besides eating and sleeping.  Only at the very end, does action move to other areas of the ship, and the film suddenly goes into action overdrive, and Ivan proves to be an Olympic level swimmer.

Camara Oscura is not a bad film, but it is disappointing that an interesting concept with potential, did not have a better story to go along with it.  The acting is fine, and there is ample suspense, and sudden unexpected violence.  The issue seems to be more with tightening up the script, and improving the staging for a better result.  The overdramatic ending would do Hollywood proud, so if you don't mind subtitles, this thriller does have merit.",1272758400,,3530,4.627009646302251
8096986,4,B000CCD1R0,"I watched this with my family on German television and it did for us what we expected it to do. A bit of thrill and suspense, interesting atmosphere and the urge to watch it until the end because you want to know who makes it out of the mess.

If you expect an original, cleverly constructed plot, absence of clich and blood and gore, this might be the wrong film for you.

The plot is clearly constructed at times to create the situations the filmmakers were aiming for. Clichs are waiting around pretty much every corner of that creepy ship. And the violence is almost never shown directly, a benefit for someone like me who is not into that kind of thing. The main element of horror is the ship and the inhumanity.

Another letdown are the underdeveloped characters. If you follow the Spanish movie scene a bit you will recognise some of the actors and know that they are in fact quite excellent. Especially the wonderful Llus Homar (the captain, 'La Mala educacin') and charismatic youngster Andrs Gertrdix (Edgar, 'The Orphanage') are severely underemployed by the scrip and direction. Just rare intimate moments like Edgar's tearful look of sadness at his friend Ivn who is about to face up the ship's crew, which probably means certain death as shown earlier in the movie, give you a hint at how interesting the exploit of emotions and relationships between the characters could have been.

Which leads to another letdown, which would be the unconvincing 'relationship' the filmmakers want to force Ivn and Sara into. Yes-yes, we know the heroine and the soon to become hero need to end up with each other but do we really want them to? No. Because there is zero chemistry between the actors. You don't even know why on earth these two should fall for each other. The only convincing connection of friendship and love is between the young couple, Victor and Thais, and between Ivn and Edgar. In fact we all ended up rooting for Ivn to end up with his friend Edgar instead of with Sara. A theory that is not even that absurd given the level of homoerotic vibes between the two characters (something for the ladies who are into that kind of undertones. If you think of the conversation going on right before Edgar's declaration of love you might wonder as well if the writers were cackling to themselves in a corner about that little twist).

Additionally there are logical flaws like the walkie-talkie suddenly being on reception-mode but I have to correct one of my fellow writers who said the movie was suddenly switching from night to midday. It begins on midday and ends in the morning of the following day. There is clearly some dawn/early morning light situation towards the end before the sun comes out.

And I liked that the movie does not follow the rules of who should die first and how likable or dislikable the villains, victims or survivors should be. Nor do I mind the characters changing their attitude without the usual Hollywood movie in-the-face explanation and monologue. That is how humans are. They are irrational and don't necessarily announce to the world when they experience a change of mind, just to let the movie audience know. So in a way the characters are acting more natural and human than those in your usual teeny horror flick that leaves no room for surprises, where you always know what kind of character you are dealing with.

Overall an average thriller with a good atmosphere which makes you mourn for all it could have been because it gives you glimpses of all its wasted potential.",1215302400,2,3527,4.706645056726094
