4893110,5,B005TZFYWU,"Bought this for xmas, and we watched it straight thru.  Insider's look at the trial mostly from the perspective of the defense.  A very odd story that is still ongoing....",1388534400,2,171,4.666666666666667
4893111,5,B005TZFYWU,There were many coincidences in this murder mystery and twists and turns.  I enjoyed it so much I bought an extra copy for my sister.  I am hoping to hear more of the owl theory that now is talked about in Margaret Peterson's death.  What a tragedy for the family.,1366675200,2,264,4.24
4893112,5,B005TZFYWU,"Very satisfied with this documentary. Revelations and twists throughout, make this a ""page turner"". Insights into court proceedings are also greatly appreciated.",1366502400,2,161,6.363636363636363
4893113,5,B005TZFYWU,While other documentaries offer the directors opinion of  guilt or not. Staircase remains skeptical and builds up as the trial unfolds.,1361059200,,135,5.428571428571429
4893114,5,B005TZFYWU,I'm an attorney and I would recommend this to anyone.  Very informative.  It's a must see for anyone with an interest in criminal justice.,1349827200,,138,4.708333333333333
4893115,5,B005TZFYWU,"This is  the very best of any viewing experience  Of my life.  Another  outstanding experience was the 'Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes' documentary about subtle and pernicious black racism,  a  brilliantly compelling dock that really shakes you up, and guided by a equally brilliant facilitator, a true expert, who gave astounding insights and examples  that confronted you extraordinarily. The Staircase Murder was different, it was another viewing for the sheer complete drama and entertainment it gave me; but to me it was perfect; Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes tested you, showed you how racism was displayed, and alarmed you about what prejudice can do to someone, how nasty, how destructive it was to black people, how it could totally ruin and destroy self esteem of not just a young and frail person, but an adult, any adult. - it was absolute top self viewing. Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes was close to The Staircase for a top viewing, but the Staircase Murder was truly 'complete entertainment', it was consummately directed by Le Strade, it is a masterpiece as the back cover of the DVD says. I do agree.
The Staircase Murder is panoramic - you get real entertainment here - drama, intrigue, interspersed with humour; you get 'more of a lot of things' here. You see actual footage of a murder trial, including many close ups of the alleged murderer, his children, his attorney, his team and the prosecution. Its vivid, its real,it's detailed, you become addicted to this 6 hour epic, you actually get to like his attorney a lot, a real lot, as you see him and accused as if they are really in a movie, and it is so good, it appears to be so - but is real, it is not a movie, they are talking about the case, the alleged murder by Michael Peterson of his wife - in other words, you have the fantastic combo of a real murder case, and natural acting, very natural acting, indeed Peterson's lawyer is so natural you think gee, this is fantastic, he's great - he is, and and it is. You see natural images and footage of lots of people, and the alleged murderer, in the murder home talking about the case in detail with all the forensics exposed and unpacked. But even more, you get very many close ups of the alleged murderer in particular, not just in court, but in the home, and you are completely riveted to that face all the time, for every millisecond (well I was anyway), because you are desperately trying to read the face, the eyes to get a signal, any signal whatever all the time about whether he did it, whether he is going to break down, whether he is innocent or not; you can't make up your mind, or if you do, something else is introduced to question the position you may have taken only minutes earlier. You know you just have to keep watching this, you just have to see it right out. The Director impeccably adds to the drama by the brilliant and gradual collation, sifting and analysis,while at the same time he continually gives you video closes up of discussions - superb, the comments by the alleged murderer, his children, the other member of the legal team, and you try to read into their faces whether they are behind the senior attorney, or whether they really believe the guy is innocent or not; wowee eh?. You get new twists and turns, one of which is amazing.  You get the dry humour of the defendant's chinese forensic specialist who very amusingly answers a serious prosecution question that makes you laugh, and you see others laughing too at the brilliant but totally natural responses he makes - it is truly superb stuff, it breaks the drama, and reenergises you to leaving the DVD to run, even though it's well past your bed time. Don't stuff around with this, yes pace your viewing,don't change channels, and 6 hours is too much in the one sitting, but don't leave a session more than a few days apart.
So to conclude, I would defy anybody not to be completely gripped by this masterpiece, no matter what little questions you may have, ones you might have wanted answers to - I did too, but it matters not.
Don't miss this viewing, it's near perfect TV drama and entertainment

I cannot recommend anything else, any other viewing at all, hat comes even close to this!!!!!!!",1331510400,11,4187,4.594377510040161
4893116,5,B005TZFYWU,"I found this eight-part series intriguing. As the story unfolds, mainly through the eyes of the accused, author Michael Peterson and his defense team, the more fascinating it becomes. Did his wife fall down the stairs or did he kill her? As more and more information is uncovered, fact really does seem stranger than fiction. I couldn't wait for each episode on TV.",1328745600,8,365,4.809523809523809

4893120,5,B005TZFYWU,Remarkable documentary.  A must see for true crime buffs.,1454457600,,57,5.333333333333333
4893121,2,B005TZFYWU,"Entertaining (if not a little too drawn out), but VERY one-sided (Peterson's). Also found the ending to be very anti-climactic after 6.5 hours of documentary. What came after the verdict is also not satisfying and really quite disturbing. In short, watchable, but no means a great dramatic documentary.",1452211200,4,302,5.3125
4893122,5,B005TZFYWU,"A careful and patient unfolding of the story that parallels what it would have been like for the participants in real time.  This results in some jaw dropping twists so watching 'The Staircase' you realise why the producers saw the potential for the story to be made into a serial.  I love the artful storytelling, I'd seen this years ago on TV and loved it but hunted the DVD up as I'm now showing it one episode a week when our family get together for Sunday dinner == it's a big hit.
I'm very grateful I saw this version first. I've seen it told several times since in the more traditional 1hr format e.g. on Dominick Dunne's ""Power, Privilege, and Justice"" but like with ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"" the slow reveal style is far better.",1449273600,5,759,4.414285714285715

4893125,4,B005TZFYWU,"I watched all 6ish hours of this documentary in one day. There went that Sunday. The thing I found fascinating is how often my allegiance switched to/from the defendant, Michael Peterson. I can't even think of a person in my real life who comes even close to this man's personality.

Peterson's team gave the documentary crew unrestrained access to Peterson, his legal team, Peterson's home (the crime scene), his family and all points in between. The Prosecution also gave access but, as the case wore on, the access to the prosecution became less and less.

Michael Peterson is the proverbial onion. Layer upon layer and, as each is peeled away, you're either for him or against him, it's fascinating. He comes across as thoughtful, intelligent, homely but, you can't help feeling there's something bubbling under in there, almost sociopathic. The kind of person who believes their own lies and lacks empathy for others. Maybe I'm being harsh but ...

His wife was discovered, by him, lay in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. She's still barely alive as Peterson calls 911 and by the time help arrives she's dead. Pretty straightforward right? Well, no. Way too much blood, way too many lacerations to the head. Something doesn't add up and the state files a murder charge. So starts the investigation and the trial.

More and more elements about Peterson come into play as his defense team prepare their defense. How about Peterson, while based in Germany, was the only other person and, therefore, the last person to see alive, another female found dead at the bottom of a staircase? Coincidence ? Tough one to swallow. This is just part of the astounding nature of this case. One after another after another curve balls thrown at the defense that they bat away as best they can.

You'll find yourself riveted for the duration and switching allegiance just as I did. There's something about Peterson that you just can't put your finger on. I keep using the word fascinating as that truly is the best way to describe this documentary and Peterson himself.",1440547200,10,2069,4.816901408450704

4893127,4,B005TZFYWU,"Not a huge ""true crime"" fan , but this is an eye opening look into a court case with amazing access to the defendant, the lawyers and the family as they though the entire court process.  You get to see their feelings as all the ""twists"" come out and how they need to prepare a defense in the face of all the evidence.  I finished the 8 part series in 2 days.  It's about 6 hours total (8, 45 min episodes).",1428796800,3,406,3.9876543209876543
4893128,5,B005TZFYWU,"Very intriguing documentary of the life and lies of Michael Peterson. From his early life to the trial for the murder of his wife "" in the staircase"" literally.. You can't stop watching!",1427932800,,186,4.666666666666667
4893129,5,B005TZFYWU,"If you like this kind of thing, you'll love this. By ""this kind of thing,"" I mean true crime stories. This is an 8-part documentary of an actual murder case, largely seen through the point of view of the defense team, but including significant excerpts from the trial as well. All done with no narration, and no sensationalist reenactments-- you're just watching actual footage of the participants. Including, in the 8th and final episode, the actual verdict. If you're used to fast-paced American cable TV type true crime stories, you'll find some of this slow going. But if you're like me, you'll find it riveting. If you watch it, I strongly suggest not reading anything else about it -- most certainly, don't ""Google"" or ""Wiki"" the case to find out what happens. There are a number of surprise revelations throughout the episodes that kept me engaged.  AFTER (but only after) you see all 8 episodes, it is quite intriguing to search the 'net for further info on the case, alternative theories, etc.",1426464000,4,1002,4.825581395348837

8486678,4,B005TZFYWU,"I think he could have had a better lawyer. He should have hotly debated in several areas and he did not. Even though, I've no doubt Rudolf believes he did a good job, if you look at certain things about the trial, it seems he missed a couple of opportunities to make certain points, or at least beleaguer the ones that couldn't be easily answered by the prosecution. For one, when Deaver began to falter, it stood out to me that nothing had been discussed about DNA on the clothes. As an attorney, shouldn't he have at least brought it up? Also, those stupid lab tests Deaver was conducting as if that was the standard for plausibility. It was brought up that Deaver didn't test the shirt for blood, but that was it. If only to put doubts in their minds, I think there was a lot of things he could have said or done to influence the jury, but he didn't. It also appears that they didn't want to considr that may an intruder could have entered into the house and surprised Kathleen. Instead they went with the idea that she fell from a few stairs up and bled out from her wounds. I also couldn't understand why they didn't consider the possibility that she might have actually fallen from a bit higher...which made it more likely that the jury would be locked into the idea that there was NO intruder, in other words, nobody else in the house, and that she fell from a few steps up and hit her head. The other thing ... the attorney handled the shorts with his bear hands, thus, contaminating it very publicly. I also thought it was very telling when Henry Lee, the forensic specialist told him at the table, that he should build up to the point and not try to slam it down too quickly. From the footage, which I understand was edited, that's exactly what I was thinking too...that Rudolf tended not to flesh out his points long enough as to clarify things to the jury.  He should have kept Lee on the stand much longer, clarifying his position particularly with the video graphic re-enactment which did seem to be plausible, once you see it through the experts eyes. I found Rudolf lightweight and he really did make a huge mistake in his opening statement about this being an ideal family and happy relationship. The guys bisexuality wouldn't matter if he wasn't being accused of murder but it does if you're cheating on your wife and trying to hide it. I really feel Rudolf was extremely short sighted on that point. Then the blow-poke...I felt like he could have made much much much more of a big deal about it being found after the police had searched high and low for it. Yes, it was discussed, but there should have been a lot more emphasis on condemnation toward possible police collusion. I mean this guy got hundreds of thousands of dollars for this defense and I don't think he did a good enough job planting doubt in anyones minds..Bottom line, I don't feel like him and his team really punctuated the finer details, where they could have. This was a 5 month trial I think. Im sure we don't see everything in the film, but of what I saw, I think the defense just really wasn't that good.
Now, did Michael Peterson kill his wife? I think he did. I think he attacked her on the stairs, strangling her and bashed her head several times into the steps and that's how she bled out. I don't think it was really planned, maybe an act of rage as things were falling apart especially financially in their lives. But I think Peterson's own words in his writings give hint of a person struggling with a very dark side of himself. I also think there is a very good chance that he killed Elizabeth Ratliff in Germany because his ex wife who was there said there was NO blood and then all the others who came after to the scene, said there was a lot of blood. Apparently, even his ex, who is the mother of his sons, continued to be swayed by him.",1528761600,,3843,4.389901823281908
8486679,4,B005TZFYWU,"I came here from the MFM podcast because I was interested in learning more about this case. This documentary is pretty long and filled superfluous details. It's also pretty clearly leaning towards the idea that Michael didn't do it and it feels like it's pushing that pretty hard.
Overall not terrible, but I did get bored several times.
I think I was hoping it would be a bit more like forensic files. Oh well.",1522195200,,411,4.5675675675675675

8486683,2,B005TZFYWU,"I watched this after reading a book about the case.  I wanted to see a lot more of the evidence.  I found that this favored the Peterson side and made the state look like they did their jobs poorly.  (It wasn't perfect but they did a lot better than was portrayed in this documentary).  Many times it was like Michael Peterson wasn't on trial for murder. He thought from the beginning he'd be acquitted so he just smiled and told jokes a lot.  Maybe that's his personality normally,  but it didn't seem appropriate for a man on trial for murdering the love of his life.  It definitely wasn't appropriate for a man who was mourning the loss of his wife.  Many times it seemed as though he and his lawyer were trying to make up a scenario that was for their liking.  They sounded ridiculous.  And like a bunch of liars. If you want more background information (such as financial troubles that may have been a motive for murder) or a more in depth analysis of the evidence, find a good book about this case and then watch the documentary.",1478217600,4,1035,4.4
