This is, as I stated in the title, one of the most poignant volumes of the Fushigi Yugi series ever.  It begins with the Suzaku Seven's arrival in Hokan, to search for the Shinzaho.  While there, Nuriko finally gets over the death of his little sister (see previous volume), and accepts that he is a man, symbolized by him cutting off his braid.  Meanwhile, they are being followed by the Seiryuu Seven, particularly Ashitare, the beast man.  When he first tries to kill Miaka, Nuriko uses a flare to fend him off.  There is also a startling revelation: Nuriko was in love with Miaka!!  Finally, when Nuriko goes alone to find the Shinzaho, he meets the vengeful Ashitare.  The meeting is fatal for both parties.  As Nuriko moves the stone blocking the entrance to the cavern in which the Shinzaho is hidden, he fantasizes about a date with Miaka in her world.  Miaka and Tamahome come running as he collapses.  After a short time, he dies in Tamahome's arms...
I cried harder watching this volume than I have ever from anything.  Nuriko was always one of my favorite characters.  He was fun, unique, and made for some great gay jokes (^_^').  The volume ""Nuriko..."" evokes some powerful emotions in even the most callous FY fan.",994982400,,1296,4.676991150442478
7921145,5,B00004REGX,"This is the ONLY time I have ever cried in the whole of the Fushigi Yugi series.  I can watch this tape one hundred times and still end up crying when...well, I can spoil the surprise.  A MUST see for ANY Fushigi Yugi and Nuriko in particular fan!

7921146,5,B00004REGX,"This volume contains some of the best, as well as *the* saddest,  episodes  in the series.  A lot of the action focuses on Nuriko (the video's named  for him, after all)--his growing bond with Miaka, as well as his--well, I  can't say.  (What, you thought I would ruin it for you?)  So quit reading  this and buy it, already!",969148800,,325,4.389830508474576
7921147,5,B00004REGX,"this was so SAD! speaking as a nurikoholic, i found this video really depressing BUT it was still one of the BEST Fushigi Yugi videos ive seen! and if u love fushigi yugi or nuriko EMAIL ME! chi-nuri-chan@chichiri.com  now then, i hate to break this to y'all...no wait...spoiler, almost missed  that. and if you love nuriko ep. 30 is also very great XD for no particular  reason...so as one last word BUY THIS MOVIE!",963014400,2,416,4.594594594594595
7921148,5,B00004REGX,This is a great but sad movie for all the Nuriko fans out there. This was one of the most heart breaking Fushigi Yugi videos that I have seen. Even if your not a Nuriko fan I feel that you will feel some sympathy for him.  There was alotta action in this video and as usual the storyline picks up  and gets better. I recomend that all Nuriko fans get this must see video,959731200,,370,3.9864864864864864
7921149,5,B00004REGX,"This video was one of the saddest and one of the best, I'm not going to tell you why however, because you'll have to find out for yourself. Like the title says, this video focuses on Nuriko. You discover that he harbors  feeling for *gasp* Miaka! He doesn't get between Miaka and Tamahome because  he wants Miaka to be happy. The last video has Tamahome discovering where  the Shinzaho is hidden and Nuriko going on ahead to get it. What he doesn't  realize though, is that one of the Seiryu seven is tracking him. What  happens next...you'll just have to see it for yourself.",955756800,3,576,4.5
7921150,5,B00004REGX,"This is the best and saddest tape of one of the best anime of all *sob*  Nuriko-sama... Buy this, people.  It's worth it.  Just have a box of tissues ready.",951264000,,156,4.133333333333334
7921151,5,B00004REGX,"This was by far the most poignant and sad of the Fushigi Yuugi videos, as well as the best to date. Even if Nuriko is not one of your favorite characters, this will definitely tug at the heatstrings, so make sure you  have the tissue handy. The animation is superb as always, the action and  drama riveting, and the storyline filled with tragedy as well as love. This  video is also perhaps the most violent, so a bit of caution if young  children are viewing it.",950227200,,463,4.348837209302325
7921152,5,B00004REGX,My daughter An and I love this video.  It was so sad and disappointed when Nuriko die.  He was so much fun and we him so much.  We are looking forward to the Quest for Shinzaho video.,949881600,,183,3.891891891891892
