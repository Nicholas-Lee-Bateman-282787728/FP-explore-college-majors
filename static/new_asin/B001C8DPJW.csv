8286265,2,B001C8DPJW,"Dull movie. Very little Santo, but has tons of footage of Haitian women dancing in some kind of voodoo ritual. It's like watching a bad National Geographic episode without the narration. Look for the Santo movies where he fights the wolf man, Dracula, Frankensteins monster etc. They are much more fun than this drivel.",1425340800,,319,4.925925925925926
8286266,3,B001C8DPJW,"OK early 70's Mexican/Haitian-made, Spanish-language (sub-titles available) Santo film.  This time he's fighting dark voodoo with the aid of a benevolent voodoo priestess.  Sasha Montenegro as the evil priestess is gorgeous.  The quality of the DVD is good.  Recommended for El Santo fans.",1423612800,,289,5.651162790697675
