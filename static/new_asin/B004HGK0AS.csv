8429516,5,B004HGK0AS,"I found Denise Druce by accident on my Amazon Fire Stick TV.  So I got this DVD set. Her work outs are very good.  Not nazi style aerobics.  (sorry if that term is offensive to some) Choreographed dance moves are easy enough for a klutz like me to manage after a few tries.  She changes up the exercise during sets so you don't get over fatigued.  Encouraging without being obnoxious.  I like her style and the work outs work.  Favorite is the Total Body Make Over sets.  Three routines plus a cool down.  Can do them separately or consecutively.  A good addition for your home ""gym"" .",1422489600,2,585,4.383177570093458
