3089233,5,B0012GVMGM,"As a fan of Classical Baby products, I worried that ""Poetry"" might be too advanced for my toddler.  Nope.  She adores it.  Additionally, she re-enacts the scene on the dvd cover -- she lays on her stomach and 'reads' thick books while quoting the poetry to herself.

""Poetry"" takes a difficult subject and brings it to toddler level, without watering it down.  The segments are interspersed with small children who explain the poems and explain how poetry works.  The animation exceeds industry standards.  As an adult, I've never liked poetry, but now I'm fascinated by it.  This dvd is phenomenal for both toddlers and adults.  I highly recommend ""Classical Baby: Poetry"".",1210982400,23,674,5.0
3089234,5,B0012GVMGM,"My son, who has watched the other 3 Classical Baby DVDs for the past year and a half, absolutely loves the Poetry Show.  He asks us to play it for him all the time and has started to recite parts of it.",1210636800,2,202,3.8095238095238093
3089235,3,B0012GVMGM,Watching my granddaughter enjoy the Classical Baby series has been sheer joy for me.  I was very disappointed in the Classical Baby Poetry DVD.  It did not measure up.  My granddaughter did not enjoy it at all.,1210291200,2,210,4.621621621621622
3089236,5,B0012GVMGM,"This is a MUST BUY item.  We LOVE the Classical Baby series and this one is as good as the rest.  It's poetry is sooo lovely and it's such a wonderful way to expose your little ones (my son is two) to poetry and the beauty of synchronous rhyme.  It's truly lovely, I wish they'd make more!  The only con I see with this item is that I wish it were longer (it's only about 20 minutes total in length).",1208908800,18,400,3.9625
3089237,5,B0012GVMGM,All Classical Baby shows - now including this one - are favorites of my daughter.  A welcome alternative to barely educational cartoons!,1208304000,3,136,5.181818181818182

3089242,5,B0012GVMGM,My 4 month old will watch this DVD all the way through happily. When she hears it on the TV she turns her head. When she is crying in the car and I turn this Poetry Show on she stops crying. She loves the Owl and the Pussy Cat the best. She also enjoys the children discussing Poetry.,1469923200,,284,3.913793103448276
3089243,5,B0012GVMGM,It's one of those dvds where you don't feel too bad about plopping your kids in front of the tv. Educational and engrossing for the youngsters.,1469404800,,143,4.538461538461538
3089244,5,B0012GVMGM,"Beautiful and charming. G'kids love it and so do I ! Presently by children who comment on the ""nature of poetry"". The poems are well chosen representing variety from Frost (""Stopping by Woods...""to Edward Lear's ""Owl and the Pussycat"" to Shakespeare)and each is animated and narrated wonderfully by just the right voice for each selection ! Beautiful introduction to poetry! Highly recommend!",1468281600,,392,5.338709677419355

3089251,5,B0012GVMGM,"Got this for my 20 month old.  It says its for when ""i'm all grown up now."" not sure what age range this is for.  yes it is a little beyond her but she still seems to enjoy some of it.
I myself really like it.  Although I am not a fan  of background TV I totally could have this going in the background and be perfectly happy.  I will say that I'm not so keen on the commentary by the kids interrupting the nice poetry, but maybe if I were still a kid I would appreciate that more.
Baby's favorites are ""Dance"" and ""Music.""
Neither of us is much a fan of ""Art.""",1447718400,,561,3.8859649122807016
3089252,5,B0012GVMGM,This CD was a bedtime ritual between my grandson and I. It is absolutely wonderful. Every infant to young child should have it.,1444435200,,127,4.565217391304348
3089253,5,B0012GVMGM,"This Classical Baby line is clever and artistic. My baby, since around 5 or 6 months, has seen them all many times, and the graphics and music really grab her attention. I, too, am happy to watch these compared to a lot of other children's programs.  The Poetry show seems to be her favorite, I think because she gets a kick out of the children interviewed between the poems.",1440288000,,375,4.434782608695652
3089254,5,B0012GVMGM,This is a delightful DVD.  I love to watch it as much as my toddler does!  Wonderful selections and excellently done.,1437177600,,117,4.523809523809524
3089255,5,B0012GVMGM,Such a clever way to introduce poetry. The celebs who read the poems all do a wonderful job.,1434067200,,92,4.166666666666667
3089256,5,B0012GVMGM,A MUST HAVE SHOW for your kids!!!  We love it!!!  And it has sparked a general love and interest of poetry among our children.  :)  I could do without the comments of the children between poetry.  I wish they just would've added more classic works of poetry.,1426204800,,258,4.404255319148936
3089257,5,B0012GVMGM,I love this whole series,1422835200,,24,4.0
3089258,3,B0012GVMGM,I bought because my 19 month old grandbaby could not get enough of baby one. Truly. Do bought because Amazon posted bought  together. But not a good idea. Would love more like the first baby one.,1419984000,,195,4.416666666666667

3089262,5,B0012GVMGM,"My children loved all of the Baby Classical.  They would sit in front of the TV from infants & be glued to it.  It is also pleasant to listen to while you try to get somethings done while they are preoccupied.  Much better than listening to Dora or Barney.  I would rather get Classical Baby stuck in my head for the day than one of those.  They are now 5 & & YO and if I turn it on, they still sit & watch it.",1412380800,,410,3.776470588235294
3089263,1,B0012GVMGM,"Only half of the film is about the poetry itself, the other half is kids' thoughts in poetry. The poetry part is good but way too short than I expected.",1411257600,,152,4.1
3089264,5,B0012GVMGM,"Very good video, although my least favorite of the 4-series, which is exceptional and one of the best series.  Far exceeds typical baby-kids videos of today.  A taste of arts to be remembered.  Well done, HBO!",1409788800,,209,4.75

3089269,5,B0012GVMGM,"I love it. It is HBOs great production. Baby can listen to it and watch it again and again, and it is so well done, we do not mind repeating it for her, again and again. I love this DVD is excellent.
The only downside it is that if you live in Europe you need the kind of DVD that plays universally all formats.
But otherwise this is an excellent production.",1400544000,,358,4.056338028169014
3089270,5,B0012GVMGM,"What a wonderful way to grow a love for the classics in a young child. This is a beautiful DVD, and it makes a wonderful gift. It is perfectly appropriate for the very young child.",1398643200,,180,4.171428571428572
3089271,5,B0012GVMGM,"This is the best of the Classical Baby series.  The music and the graphics are as powerful as the words.  The combination is exquisite, compelling.  My grandchildren, aged 5 and 3, love this one.",1397174400,,195,4.676470588235294
3089272,5,B0012GVMGM,"When my grandson was an infant, my daughter found ""Classical Baby - Poetry"" on tv and DVRd it.  We watched it often because even though he was so young, my grandson seemed to hang on every word and smiled at the animation.  Two years later, my granddaughter was born and we played this wonderful show for both of them, together.  My granddaughter smiled throughout... and we both were especially enraptured with ""My Valentine"" by Gertrude Stein.  We have a shared love of ladybugs thanks to this poem.  No longer on DVR, I finally found the DVD and gave it to my granddaughter for her 5th birthday.  She loved it... and my grandson remembered very specific points of the show.  I highly recommend this collection of gently spoken, sweet poems with beautiful illustrations.  It's a calming show that holds young children's attention.  A nice change of pace from most of what is available for little ones.  It's a wonderful addition to any library.",1392508800,,946,4.783950617283951
3089273,2,B0012GVMGM,This is more for a toddler age!! It's unlike all of the other Classical Baby's. HBO missed the mark with this one.,1391817600,,114,4.2272727272727275
3089274,5,B0012GVMGM,"Great video. Not too long. Exposes kids to great poetry and beautiful animation. I also love that there are interviews with children, so my daughter gets to see their expressive faces as they talk about poetry.",1389225600,,210,4.861111111111111
3089275,5,B0012GVMGM,"Great illustration, music and poem! My 2.5 yo son can rarely focus on one DVD for too long, but this one just kept him interested from the beginning till the end. Money well spent.",1389052800,,180,4.323529411764706
3089276,5,B0012GVMGM,The music is great and my son absolutely loves the animation. He is glued to the TV screen when I put the classical baby DVDs on. He smiles & happily claps along with the characters. each video is 30 mn and at his age that enough. I,1388016000,,232,3.9574468085106385
3089277,5,B0012GVMGM,We received our DVD classical baby the next day. Our baby loves this video! It is soothing and attention grabbing. It was in perfect condition and prompt delivery! Thank you!,1386979200,,174,4.833333333333333
3089278,5,B0012GVMGM,Great video with wonderful illustrations and music! My son and nephews can't stop watching it.  We purchased the entire series,1386806400,,126,5.3
3089279,3,B0012GVMGM,as the original series...has interviews with kids talking about how poetry makes you feel...very sweet but not in alignment with the others in this series,1380672000,,154,5.2
3089280,5,B0012GVMGM,Really a great addition to the Classical Baby series. Our two-year-old loves watching it. It gives us something to talk about and interact together when watching.,1370044800,,162,5.269230769230769
3089281,5,B0012GVMGM,It's sure hard to beat my kiddo learning words while watching this show.  She loves to dance and giggle while watching.,1368489600,,119,4.666666666666667
3089282,4,B0012GVMGM,"We like all the Classical Baby series. My 4 year old son loves Dance, Music, and Art. The poetry is entertaining, and has children older than my son, but I'm have yet to see a bunch of young kids who are deeply into poetry, meter, etc. But, it's a terrific video. Maybe you can use it to interest your kids in poetry...",1367798400,,319,4.161290322580645
3089283,5,B0012GVMGM,My grandson has been watching them since he was 9 months old and just loves them.  We love them too. Exceptionally well done!,1366156800,,125,4.434782608695652
3089284,5,B0012GVMGM,I love this DVD.  It is not just for children.  I have shared it with triends and family.  Thank you,1365638400,,100,3.9
3089285,4,B0012GVMGM,"2 years old son loves all classical baby collection. he doesn't seem to be interested in this dvd. contents are very good, but not appealing to my son.",1364947200,,151,4.428571428571429
3089286,5,B0012GVMGM,Terrific introduction to poetry for children. My grandkids love it! I recommend this if you would like your children to have some degree of literacy and classical education,1363737600,,172,5.178571428571429
3089287,4,B0012GVMGM,"My baby loves the Classical Baby videos and my husband and I kind of enjoy watching them as well. She doesn't seem to like this one quite as much (it is aimed at an older audience, so she is a bit young for it), but it's still a really good addition to the Classical Baby collection. These videos are both educational and relaxing- the Poetry Show has similar qualities. It differs, however, because there are these super smart young kids explaining the elements of poetry and, at times, reading poetry (I love that my little munchkin will see these kids being excited about it!). I mostly liked the poetry choices, too.
I recommend this to parents.",1363737600,,649,4.603448275862069
3089288,5,B0012GVMGM,I am not a poetry person but I do love this poetry DVD.]I appreciate watching the pictures / art. They are so beautiful and creative. My baby loves watching other children talk. She loves the songs. I wish the DVD can be longer. it feels like 15 minutes long to me.,1361836800,,265,4.215686274509804
3089289,4,B0012GVMGM,"The poetry edition is on par with the originals in nearly all ways.  My only dislike is the departure from animation when they interview kids in a sort of ""Reading Rainbow"" style.  Maybe my kids will like that as they get a bit older, but for now they just want music, words, and pretty colors.",1360108800,,294,4.327272727272727
3089290,5,B0012GVMGM,"It's a calm video that adults won't mind watching over and over. This is a really great series (the art and classical music ones, too). Our son even knows some of the lines of the poems which he says sometimes.",1359763200,,210,4.275
3089291,5,B0012GVMGM,This video includes a good selection of poems read and illustrated in interesting ways. Some of the poems are very beautifully done. Great introduction to poetry.,1357862400,,162,5.269230769230769
3089292,5,B0012GVMGM,"This is the only video that she will watch (besides Caesar the dog whisper, because of all the cute dogs, lol!)
I think it's because:

 music and animation are calm and well made (not frenetic like most cartoons)
 there are short segments with young children (4-9 yrs old) where they speak about poems. IT'S GREAT!
 each poem is animated differently and it's short (2-3 minutes each) KEEPS HER INTEREST
 there's an animated child MC who introduces the poems
 it's less than 30 minutes in total length
 Celebrity voices and authors, singers, readers is a plus for parents.

We don't watch much TV. We are making it a point to avoid TV for our child (16 months old), but this is a wonderful family program, that we all watch together and we talk about it as it's running, so she's not being baby sat by the program.",1357344000,,813,4.52054794520548

But it is new, my kid still like to watch it every so often.",1357257600,,97,3.260869565217391
3089294,5,B0012GVMGM,"We baught the poetry and music dvds after we tried the dance and art. As I said in my other review, we are very pleased with them. I love the children discussing poetry and the selection of poetry on this dvd.",1356912000,,209,4.121951219512195
3089295,5,B0012GVMGM,You can watch it with your kids for holiday time. It makes very peaceful moment and also same time you can introduce about the poetry to the kids.,1355788800,,146,4.25
3089296,5,B0012GVMGM,"My son has loved this since he was 4 months old. He's 11 months now and he will watch it three or more times if I keep playing it for him. He plays on the floor and looks up to watch the children commenting, and he definitely has his favorite ""friends"" in the show. I like it because it's got substantial content in an easy to digest format, and he probably won't develop ADD from this like he might from Sponge Bob. Or so I hear. I think it's great, and I hope there's a sequel. We have the entire Classical Baby set, but the Poetry Show is by far our favorite.",1355184000,,562,4.026785714285714
3089297,5,B0012GVMGM,"We have had the entire Classical Baby series since my daughter was born.  It's really good stuff.  Educational, artistic, fun to watch and really well done.  As an adult, I find myself sucked in every time we watch these.  There are four versions.  The Poetry Show is with out a doubt the most ""verbal"" of the lot with all of the wonderful spoken language brought to life with lovely art work.  All four have a calm manner about them, making them perfect for relaxation time or for watching during long car rides.  I honestly can't recommend these enough.  This is TV you won't feel guilty about letting your kids watch.",1355097600,,620,4.572727272727272
3089298,5,B0012GVMGM,A priceless treasure to be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  I saw The Poetry Show on HBO and just had to have it.  I enjoy it as much as my 3-year old does.,1353369600,,156,3.5588235294117645
3089299,4,B0012GVMGM,"I like ALL of the Classical Baby series!!
Really appeals to our grandson... wonder how much he will retain... without being able to read.
I have probably learned more than he.",1353196800,,175,4.67741935483871
3089300,1,B0012GVMGM,"I bought three copies as Christmas presents for my nephews. None would play on an Australian player, only in North America. So I went back months later and bought 3x again.... this time making sure to select my region. Still no luck. 6 dud copies of this delightful DVD and I can't use any of them. Amazon should not be shipping products that are clearly unusable in my region.",1352592000,,377,4.478260869565218
3089301,4,B0012GVMGM,"This is an excellent product that I wish I found a few years ago as my daughter is now 4 1/2. Initially when I first opened it I watched it by myself, which I often do before handing over to my little ones as it is less of censoring but more to preparing myself for likely questions. When I first watched it I was worried that my daughter might not find it interesting enough as the graphics does feel like it's gear towards a younger audience. However, she watched it for the first time today and she was mesmerized!

Between each poem it showed interviews of little children's view about poetry, I think that makes my daughter feels more interested as the ""I-want-to-know-because-other-kids-know"" syndrome kicks in... Now, I cannot comment on how much longer this DVD can hold her attention as she has only watched it once, I plan to give this DVD to her every morning while she eats breakfast until she asks me to stop!

Each poem is beautifully read by actors, it is not ""dumb-down"" at all, especially the last poem How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning read by Gwyneth Paltrow moved me to tears when I watched it the first time.

One thing that I would love to have with this DVD is to have a booklet with all the poems/lyrics listed out for the parents, and even some analysis on each of the poems, as I have never learnt any of these poetries before (English is my second language) I will not be able to recite or teach my child the contents without the written copy in front of me. Because currently there is nothing, not even a list of the titles of the poetry is listed anywhere in the box except showing at the end of the video. I guess it is time for me to do some home work to make this DVD even more perfect!",1343779200,,1746,4.317073170731708
3089302,5,B0012GVMGM,"I enjoy watching Classical Art, Music, and Dance with two of my grandchildren who visit frequently.  While only 2 and 3 1/2 years old, they barely move or make a sound while the DVDs are playing and always ask for ""one more"".  Classical Poetry is the perfect continuation of the series with the little baby ""grown up"".  My grandchildren seem to love the real children who make an appearance in this series.
In the Classical Art series, there is a Mary Cassatt painting of  a Mother and Child and my granddaughter saw immediately that the little girl looked quite like her.  I discovered that this painting was at the Metropolitan Museum and so I planned a day to visit the museum with her (the perfect follow-up to the DVD).  The photo of her standing by the painting is priceless.

We will be writing poetry next.  The Classical Baby Poetry DVD is such a great introduction to poetry - especially with all the different opinions about just what it is.",1340841600,,952,4.591715976331361
3089303,5,B0012GVMGM,This video is loved by my grandchildren from ages 2to9 and also by me. The children are adorable in the video. Iit inspires you to love poetry and we love the poems and the actor/readers.  We are excited about all of the classical baby DVD's.,1338163200,,242,4.377777777777778
3089304,4,B0012GVMGM,"This is a wonderful addition to the ""Classical Baby"" collection...the poems, for the most part (I love Elizabeth Mitchell, but the ""Grassy Grass Grass"" poem by Woody Guthrie is just a little goofy), are read beautifully, and the children talking about poetry in between each animated segment are adorable.  There's this one kid with an English accent who is hilarious...VERY serious that ""poetry is about YOU!""  I couldn't agree more.  My twins--21 months--go silent and still when I put this on.  Doesn't get better than that!",1332806400,,527,5.093023255813954

But I think this production is more valuable for its contents and the value we might place on it, should we already know a little bit about poetry.  All the reviews on this site about this production are quite pleasant, but this one is written to the person that knows a few names and wants to know more.  How would you like to hear William Carlos Williams read HIS OWN poetry in his high, quavery voice, and then the entire (short) poem is repeated by a little girl - by memory.  Then Andy Garcia, whose Spanish is absolutely perfect, recites a poem about a butterfly.  Langston Hughes recites his poem about rain in April while children are seen playing in the rain - who could forget his voice?  And the finale is a mother rabbit telling her baby rabbit the Browning poem How Do I Love Thee - read by Gwyneth Paltrow!  It is truly a memorable finale for a fine video.  Look how much it costs!  Isn't that a STEAL for some of the greatest poetry ever written? If you have a child old enough to watch this production, you won't be sorry.  But don't let that stop you if you don't have children!

She loved the Classical Baby series so I just bought the Poetry edition without reading the reviews.  Everyone in our house enjoyed the first three DVDs so much that we gave sets away as baby gifts.

The animation and choice of material in the latest edition is lovely but my daughter absolutely HATED the segments showing children talking about poetry.  For that reason, the DVD really got really annoying really quickly.

We travel a bit, and it helps keep the car atmoshpere mellow.  Also, my 10 year old is an avid reader, and she came across a book ""Hate That Cat"" that referenced some of the poetry from the show.

""Poetry"" takes a difficult subject and brings it to toddler level, without watering it down.  The segments are interspersed with small children who explain the poems and explain how poetry works.

It is also pleasant to listen to while you try to get somethings done while they are preoccupied.  Much better than listening to Dora or Barney.  I would rather get Classical Baby stuck in my head for the day than one of those.  They are now 5 & & YO and if I turn it on, they still sit & watch it.",1412380800,,410,3.776470588235294

We watched it often because even though he was so young, my grandson seemed to hang on every word and smiled at the animation.  Two years later, my granddaughter was born and we played this wonderful show for both of them, together.  My granddaughter smiled throughout... and we both were especially enraptured with ""My Valentine"" by Gertrude Stein.  We have a shared love of ladybugs thanks to this poem.  No longer on DVR, I finally found the DVD and gave it to my granddaughter for her 5th birthday.  She loved it... and my grandson remembered very specific points of the show.  I highly recommend this collection of gently spoken, sweet poems with beautiful illustrations.  It's a calming show that holds young children's attention.  A nice change of pace from most of what is available for little ones.  It's a wonderful addition to any library.",1392508800,,946,4.783950617283951

She doesn't seem to like this one quite as much (it is aimed at an older audience, so she is a bit young for it), but it's still a really good addition to the Classical Baby collection. These videos are both educational and relaxing- the Poetry Show has similar qualities. It differs, however, because there are these super smart young kids explaining the elements of poetry and, at times, reading poetry (I love that my little munchkin will see these kids being excited about it!). I mostly liked the poetry choices, too.
I recommend this to parents.",1363737600,,649,4.603448275862069

3323789,5,B0012GVMGM,"This is the only video that she will watch (besides Caesar the dog whisper, because of all the cute dogs, lol!)
I think it's because:

 music and animation are calm and well made (not frenetic like most cartoons)
 there are short segments with young children (4-9 yrs old) where they speak about poems. IT'S GREAT!
 each poem is animated differently and it's short (2-3 minutes each) KEEPS HER INTEREST
 there's an animated child MC who introduces the poems
 it's less than 30 minutes in total length
 Celebrity voices and authors, singers, readers is a plus for parents.

We don't watch much TV. We are making it a point to avoid TV for our child (16 months old), but this is a wonderful family program, that we all watch together and we talk about it as it's running, so she's not being baby sat by the program.",1357344000,,813,4.52054794520548

He plays on the floor and looks up to watch the children commenting, and he definitely has his favorite ""friends"" in the show. I like it because it's got substantial content in an easy to digest format, and he probably won't develop ADD from this like he might from Sponge Bob. Or so I hear. I think it's great, and I hope there's a sequel. We have the entire Classical Baby set, but the Poetry Show is by far our favorite.",1355184000,,562,4.026785714285714

As an adult, I find myself sucked in every time we watch these.  There are four versions.  The Poetry Show is with out a doubt the most ""verbal"" of the lot with all of the wonderful spoken language brought to life with lovely art work.  All four have a calm manner about them, making them perfect for relaxation time or for watching during long car rides.  I honestly can't recommend these enough.  This is TV you won't feel guilty about letting your kids watch.",1355097600,,620,4.572727272727272

3323798,4,B0012GVMGM,"This is an excellent product that I wish I found a few years ago as my daughter is now 4 1/2. Initially when I first opened it I watched it by myself, which I often do before handing over to my little ones as it is less of censoring but more to preparing myself for likely questions. When I first watched it I was worried that my daughter might not find it interesting enough as the graphics does feel like it's gear towards a younger audience. However, she watched it for the first time today and she was mesmerized!

Between each poem it showed interviews of little children's view about poetry, I think that makes my daughter feels more interested as the ""I-want-to-know-because-other-kids-know"" syndrome kicks in... Now, I cannot comment on how much longer this DVD can hold her attention as she has only watched it once, I plan to give this DVD to her every morning while she eats breakfast until she asks me to stop!

Each poem is beautifully read by actors, it is not ""dumb-down"" at all, especially the last poem How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning read by Gwyneth Paltrow moved me to tears when I watched it the first time.

One thing that I would love to have with this DVD is to have a booklet with all the poems/lyrics listed out for the parents, and even some analysis on each of the poems, as I have never learnt any of these poetries before (English is my second language) I will not be able to recite or teach my child the contents without the written copy in front of me. Because currently there is nothing, not even a list of the titles of the poetry is listed anywhere in the box except showing at the end of the video.

While only 2 and 3 1/2 years old, they barely move or make a sound while the DVDs are playing and always ask for ""one more"".  Classical Poetry is the perfect continuation of the series with the little baby ""grown up"".  My grandchildren seem to love the real children who make an appearance in this series.
In the Classical Art series, there is a Mary Cassatt painting of  a Mother and Child and my granddaughter saw immediately that the little girl looked quite like her.  I discovered that this painting was at the Metropolitan Museum and so I planned a day to visit the museum with her (the perfect follow-up to the DVD).  The photo of her standing by the painting is priceless.

We will be writing poetry next.  The Classical Baby Poetry DVD is such a great introduction to poetry - especially with all the different opinions about just what it is.",1340841600,,952,4.591715976331361

There's this one kid with an English accent who is hilarious...VERY serious that ""poetry is about YOU!""  I couldn't agree more.  My twins--21 months--go silent and still when I put this on.

But I think this production is more valuable for its contents and the value we might place on it, should we already know a little bit about poetry.  All the reviews on this site about this production are quite pleasant, but this one is written to the person that knows a few names and wants to know more.  How would you like to hear William Carlos Williams read HIS OWN poetry in his high, quavery voice, and then the entire (short) poem is repeated by a little girl - by memory.  Then Andy Garcia, whose Spanish is absolutely perfect, recites a poem about a butterfly.  Langston Hughes recites his poem about rain in April while children are seen playing in the rain - who could forget his voice?  And the finale is a mother rabbit telling her baby rabbit the Browning poem How Do I Love Thee - read by Gwyneth Paltrow!  It is truly a memorable finale for a fine video.  Look how much it costs!

This video is for kids a little older, as it deals with poetry and words.

We also have Goodnight Moon, bedtime stories with footage of kids in between talking about their concept of sleep and dreams. It's very persuasive.

PLEASE HBO MAKE MORE OF THESE PROGRAMS!! These videos make great gifts for parents and little ones....or try it with the elderly, nursing homes, Alzheimer's units, senior day care centers. My mom loves little kids, so she can't get enough of these videos.",1240963200,6,646,4.6

3323830,5,B0012GVMGM,"We do not own the DVD, but we saved it to our DVR when it aired on HBO Family because our son loved the Classical Baby 2 (also aired on HBO, not purchased), which has art and music.  Though its format is different than the others - if you've read other reviews, you know that it has brief segments throughout with little children discussing poetry - my son LOVES this show as much, if not more, than the other Classical Baby shows.  It is full of animated segments with voiceovers by both celebrities and some of the singers / poets themselves (e.g., William Carlos Williams, Langston Hughes).  While I've never been a fan of the animation in this series, it's not for me, right??  My son really likes the animation.  And the poems are relatively kid-friendly and recited in a soothing tone.

My son has been watching this for so long that at 21 months, he asks for it by name.  ""Want to watch 'The Poetry Show'!""  Now, I'm not proud that he's begging to watch TV, ha... but it sure beats Spongebob Squarepants!",1239321600,5,1011,4.456521739130435

She loved the Classical Baby series so I just bought the Poetry edition without reading the reviews.  Everyone in our house enjoyed the first three DVDs so much that we gave sets away as baby gifts.

The animation and choice of material in the latest edition is lovely but my daughter absolutely HATED the segments showing children talking about poetry.  For that reason, the DVD really got really annoying really quickly.

I think if they'd stuck to the original format without inserting the kids, it would've been more enjoyable.

Maybe we'll have better luck next time.",1225152000,13,629,4.831775700934579

The commentating by the kids on here are absolutely adorable. Very well thought out and intelectual for their age.  Anyway, I love it so much I bought the entire series.  We travel a bit, and it helps keep the car atmoshpere mellow.  Also, my 10 year old is an avid reader, and she came across a book ""Hate That Cat"" that referenced some of the poetry from the show.  She was so excited that she knew who William Carlos Williams was and that she knew some of his poems already.  The Poetry Show has helped to be a part of something special with all three of my kids.

The children interviewed in this DVD are so sweet and cerebral. It truly inspires a parent to introduce their children to the arts at a young age.
