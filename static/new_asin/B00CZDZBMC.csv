8587908,4,B00CZDZBMC,"What is inside:
-1h15m of basic isolations, layered with weight change (horizontal/vertical hip and chest, pelvis up and down) with rather simple yet tricky combinations (essentially the same move, say side slide of chest, is done with varying tempos, and layered with in-place stepping).
-15 minutes layering-Again simple yet tricky combinations, mixing the moves from the isolation section
-A few combinations, namely:
-one entrance combination- no variations, etc, just one single combination
 -one combination with samba step
-one closing combination with Karim Nagi live (quite classical: basically shimmi and finish with spins)
-a gorgeus performance of Sadie to a drum solo- really inspiring.
-Extra performances (you really have to go to the chapter 'Extras' to find them)

MY OPINION: getting some cleaning and extra (tricky, but basic) variations on your basic isolations is always great, no matter where you stand in your dance. I have worked about 3 hours on this DVD and will probably work about 3 more so i think it is obviously  worth the price- I think Sadie designed this DVD with the intention of making the student repeat more that it is actually showcased in the DVD.
Will this DVD  inspire you to dance a  better in a drum solo? I think that there are no way enough combinations and variations of combinations to say so. Of course, it will still make your technique better and the performances are very inspiring. So i think a more truthful title would be
'Essential technique for a perfect drum solo'. I do not think that this DVD  will really give you any idea on how to structure a drum solo, any new ideas on how to dance it, or how to improve your own dancing to a drum solo.",1451174400,,1701,4.848275862068966

8587911,5,B00CZDZBMC,l love the way Sadie clearly breaks down her technique and choreography.  It easy to understand and to follow.  I would recommend the dvd to all  Belly Danceres.,1381881600,2,161,4.678571428571429

play all-Exactly as it states

Chapters: This section is broken down into 3 chapters
Chapter 1:
Posture: I always love a good posture section and I think sadie did a wonderful job breaking down the posture section and what how the body should be aligned.
Isolation's, A small lecture about how to dance to a drum solo. This was pretty much an overview of what the dvd is going to go over. In a very short synopsis.
vertical hips-oblique crunches which reminds me very much of practice for beginners ups
drill 1
drill1 with music
drill2-glute squeezes with an arm pathway. The arm pathways are usually snake arms or going up and coming down in a circle like motion.
drill2 with music
drill3-Hip Locks with a twist and arm pathways with step touch. This was one of my favorite combo to learn
drill3 with music
Verticle chest-Chest ups and downs
drill4-Chest locks -very similar to some of the other chest  exercises in previous videos, but of course the ups and downs are put into a new pattern.
drill4 -with music
drill4 part 2-like drill 4 but with footwork

Chapter 2:
Horizontal chest-Forward, back and side to side chest movement.
drill5-chest slides,marching in place
drill5 with music
horizontal hips-
drill6-twist locks  and ups
drill6 with music
drill7-chest slides/locks,hip twist and head slides
pelvic isolation's
drill8-Chest and pelvic lifts and drops walking- I loved this combination
drill8 with music
timing and layering
drill 9 -hip locks in releve-I loved this comb's as well
drill9 with music

Chapter 3:
Drill 10-step touch/vertical hip movements with chest drops and lifts
drill 10 with music
Highlights-A short statement about also needing stage presence to make you a good dancer.
opening combo
fusion combo-samba step layered with dance moves
pop and lock combo
dynamic closing- a demo of closing in a dynamic way. I loved -demo performed twice.
signature moves-Here sadie talks about making the dance your own.
performance-Loved her black costume. Unfortunately I had saw the entire dance on youtube before purchasing this dvd.
 and credits

Drills
The drill section is the section where you get to drill all the combos and technique learned in the previous 3 chapters. You drill everything up until the dynamic
closing.

Extra's
Live performance with Karim Nagi-Seems to be improvised
Performance by Atlantis-She talks a little about the 9/8 rhythm not in depth and then does a performance with zills. FYI: The actual 9/8 rhythm is not broken down.
Performance by Maria Sokolova: She does a piece using veil and zills.
I was not a fan of this performance section.

  I  was super excited to get this dvd. To moi Sadie is THE best at drum solo's. I know everyone has their favorite dancers but she kills it (IMO) every time. I saw the dvd on presale and waited until it came to amazon to purchase it. Sadie scattered tips throughout the dvd but I won't give those away. Sadie's way of explaining things is ingenious. I thought it was good to actually add a section just for practicing the drills all the way through
The material is given in an easy format. It is super easy to navigate through windows, and get to the content that you want to use. Sadie relates beautifully to her learners. Production and quality of the dvd were good. No weird or unnecessary camera angles. Every movement was easy to see and broken down well. She is teaching in a room that is all white, there are no weird distractions. The focus is entirely on her. The room is well lite. I would not put this dvd in the beginner category though. Sadie's breakdown is nice but a beginner may fair better with pops, locks and shimmies 1 or Thrillin drillin which gives a  more detailed breakdown and practice session than presented. There is no warm-up, so if you are using this dvd you probably will want to warm-up before hand. Her cueing is good.

  I enjoyed the fact that new combo's  and layers were added. I liked the music used for the drills and teaching. I appreciated the dvd even more because the combo's are useful. Sadie is an excellent teacher as usual, one of her trademarks along with her flawless technique. I do however feel this dvd may have come up short after all that. To be completely honest it appears to be a drill dvd more so than a dvd geared toward drum solo secrets. The information about the drum solo was sparse and not covered in depth. The dynamic closing section is more along the lines of what I thought the dvd was going to be about in its entirety.
  This dvd altogether is going to have a very good shelf life as all sadie dvd's do. Not like say.. ranye renee's baladi but good enough to see a difference in your technique. Some of  the extra's' presented added to the dvd. I could definitely see the live drum solo improvised with Karim and I could see where the performance with Atlantis was going. I think it would have been nice if instead of a full choreography Atlantis actually broke down the 9/8 rhythm and demo'ed some basic moves to dance to it. The Performance with Maria??..cool nonetheless. Again a lot of the combo's are new. A very few appear to be variations of other sadie drills I have seen, but they are put into a different sequence and present a nice challenge. I'm not quite sure where this dvd belongs. I think this dvd is  more than excellent as a drill dvd, but I am not sure it was marketed so much as a drill dvd as oppose to a drum solo dvd. No rhythm break down,no drum solo musicality. I wanted some pick your brain, information on the dvd. How exactly does Sadie begin to choreograph for drum solo's, or what is the most common rhythms used on drum solo's or how to make a drum interaction memorable to the audience or...You get the point. It hard to rate this dvd against other drum solo dvd's, usually they are either choreography or in depth about the rhythm breakdown.
  I would love to give this dvd five stars and for a drill dvd it deserves it. I think the concept is beautiful and perfect for someone to teach who has mastered their craft like sadie, but this dvd is not executed to perfection. Since its main purpose was for a drum solo secrets I would have to put it at a 3. The only parts that really touched on a drum solo were some parts of chapter 3. This dvd does not live up to its said purpose. It is basically a drills dvd with a small amount of drum solo advice. If you are looking for a dvd that's concentration is on drum solo's or dancing live to drum solo's-look elsewhere, this will not be in-depth.
Is this dvd worth it? I'm at a standstill for drilling yes, for drum solo-ing no. . Must have dvd? No.

For a more in-depth dvd to use in conjunction with this try Karim Nagi's live music and movement. That is a really good dvd to use for drum solos and dancing with drummer and to live music in general.",1379203200,11,7215,4.531538461538462
8587913,4,B00CZDZBMC,"Another good dvd from Sadie.  Her style is so unique and inspiring.  As usual her teaching is clear and concise.  I thought there might be more in depth information on dancing with a live drummer-there was some indeed, just not as much as I had expected.  The moves covered were similar to her other dvds.  Overall, this dvd is filled with good material.  I recommend it to teachers, more advanced dancers, and committed new dancers.",1379203200,4,433,4.706666666666667
8587914,5,B00CZDZBMC,"Dvd is fantastic! Sadie explains things well, and tells you not just how you're supposed to move but also what ure supposed to feel! What muscles ure working and when to relax, when to contract and with her i see improvements every day. Things that i have been practicing for months such as chest lifts and isolations came to me easy after watching her dvd and doing it in front of the computer! i love it ! you gotta work... but all your work is worthless if ure not practicing with the right technique ! and that's what she offers u..the right technique step by step ! thank you Sadie :)",1373673600,2,589,4.315315315315315
