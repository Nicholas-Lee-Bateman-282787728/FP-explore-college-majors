6568109,5,B00ME8ENL8,"Even though my brother was one of the principals at the Special Prosecutor's office, and I had an insight into some of the lessor activities there I was surprised at some of the video's content, e.g. President Ford consulted with several government executives before he satisified himself that a pardon for Pres. Nixon would be the best thing for the country. And, there were outer insights that I didn't know about and wondered about how much of that was known by my brother. He now has the video but I've not consulted with him about what he thought about some of the specifics/",1417824000,7,580,4.640776699029126

6568111,4,B00ME8ENL8,"A very thorough and entertaining documentary. Cavett's easy going style makes this one of the best videos available regarding the subject of Watergate. The only problem, since it's only 60 minutes in length, is that it leaves you wanting even more.",1416182400,9,248,5.073170731707317
6568112,5,B00ME8ENL8,"In the ""Late Night Talk Show"" competitions in the 1970s and 80s one man stood out among the rest as being the guy who got the best celebrities and newsmakers. That was Dick Cavett. There are a few - not as many as I would like - DVD volumes of some of his interviews on the market. Though not a full volume of his ABC - and later PBS - talk show, this all-too-brief DVD shows how articulate Cavett was (and still is). He rarely had a guest who was promoting a new movie or selling something. They were there to talk - frankly and intelligently).

2014 marks the 40th Anniversary of the Watergate break-in and subsequent investigation and the resignation of Richard Nixon as President of the US. What this show - which aired on PBS but - thanks to PBS Home Video  - can now be made available in schools and libraries (and it should) does in just 58 minutes is to present a summary of the events from beginning to end using clips from Cavett shows as well as include new recent comments from, not only Cavett himself, but from Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -(who broke the story), John Dean  and the former Director of the Nixon Library. Not only did folks like Sen. Ted Kennedy, President Gerald Ford, and author Gore Vidal appear on the Cavett show but he was able to take his show to the Senate investigation room to interview the Committee head, Senator Sam Ervin and others. This is all laid out in the order of the events and there is not a dull moment here.

This is a piece of American history that needs to be remembered and the program is at the right length for both classroom use and anyone who wants to see why Cavett's show was a must see in many homes - including mine.
There are no special bonuses but there is subtitle option.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8671740,5,B00ME8ENL8,"Dick Cavett is a masterful interviewer with a touch of gotcha thrown in.  I especially enjoyed the part that had Dick in the Senate hearing room.
Really enjoyed the part of the dvd that had the Watergate criminals in it",1511308800,,219,4.475
8671741,5,B00ME8ENL8,"For those born too late to have seen Dick Cavett's late-night talk show, this overview of Watergate demonstrates why he was so admired & avidly watched. Smart, thoughtful, witty, erudite, and always entertaining, he also understood the importance of getting out of the way of his guests & allowing them to talk, often simply moving the conversation along with a single point or comment. And as this compilation shows, both he & his audience were eager for real talk about real issues, in-depth & incisive talk with all of the players. Just about anyone & everyone involved in Watergate, on every side, was given the opportunity to appear on Cavett's show & give their thoughts & viewpoints.

If I have one complaint about this disc, it's the same one noted by previous reviewers: it's only an hour long, and should have included much more. Even so, it's an excellent primer on Watergate as it progressed month by month, ending in the necessary toppling of a corrupt President. Sadly, it seems as if that tragedy is now being played out again, this time as horribly grotesque farce -- the pity of it is that we don't have a show like Cavett's to cover it now. This is an invaluable source for history as it was being written in real time, on the spot -- highly recommended!",1502841600,2,1272,4.653333333333333
8671742,3,B00ME8ENL8,I want a more comprehensive DVD set of Dick Cavette's broadcasts during the Watergate era. I see that they are available streaming but that is not good enough. When the issue is controversial information I do not want to merely borrow access to the document from somebody's stream. I want a hard copy for my own personal archives.,1501718400,,330,4.706896551724138

8671745,4,B00ME8ENL8,Following arrests at the Watergate office complex that caught men associated with the Republican Party as the aspired to place recording equipment at the Democratic National Committee headquarters talk show host Dick Cavett begins a one-man crusade to examine the seemingly laughable behavior by interviewing a series of political people and reporters as well as people on the street. Despite this President Nixon easily gets reelected. It is not until much time passes and congressional hearings and the discovery of secret Oval Office tape recordings that the tide turns. Insightful and surreal.,1481414400,,597,5.5
8671746,5,B00ME8ENL8,Amazing info related to Dick's shows. Didn't realize the correlation before seeing it.,1473897600,,86,5.6923076923076925
8671747,5,B00ME8ENL8,"A treasure for someone who saw it all on TV originally.  Even members of his party, namely, Howard Baker of Tennesee, asked the tough questions.
