8221029,5,B000W26VU4,"What an excellent way to be introduced to KDramas -- attractive cast with great writing.  One subplot is a little too teeny-bopper for me, but it gets very little screentime compared to the principal tension: down-on-her-luck girl and charming-but-lonely guy question whether they can be just friends after they accidentally end up living together.

Funny and moving.  Watch it.",1450224000,,378,5.372881355932203
