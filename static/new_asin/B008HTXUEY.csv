8528219,1,B008HTXUEY,"You tube has instructional videos, some are good, some are poorly done. This is a poorly done youtube instructional video only its way too long and horrifically too much money!!! I thought I'd give it a chance, thinking that maybe I'd learn a Tunisian style since I will be going there soon but honestly I felt like I was scammed. I never knew that amazon approved of having sellers like this. The video quality is that of 1990s blare witch project, as she does her cho-cho shimmy the camera shakes a little. The actual dance instruction is very basic, compared to other videos the instructors covers 10 routines in the time Veda tells you how to do one.",1385164800,,654,4.5508474576271185
8528220,5,B008HTXUEY,"I now have Sereem's Moroccan DVD, have recently purchased her Tunisian DVD, and hope to purchase more of her DVD dance instructions.  Even though I am already a dancer, I am sure that beginners would find her very easy to follow.  The costume tips she gives are also concise and helpful.  The choreograpies themselves are worth the purchase price, and I'm hoping that she sees this review, because I truly appreciate what I've learned from her.  She also works showing movements from the front AND the rear, making it much more easy for  novices to follow.  Thank you, Veda Sereem for bringing these dances to us!",1365811200,2,613,4.735849056603773
