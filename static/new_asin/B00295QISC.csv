8357546,3,B00295QISC,"This program presents a good look at U.S. Air Force UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) operations as of May 2009, focusing on operations at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, NV.  It emphasizes how ""pilots"" sitting in trailers in the Nevada desert can deploy ordnance thousands of miles away in Afghanistan.

But I cannot give more than 3 stars to any video that represents such rotten value for money.  $17.95 for 13:16 is unacceptable.  Amazon needs to take $10 off of all of the 60 Minutes video series.  Then I might give it another star.

One other caveat: while all of these videos have sound recorded at a low level, this one is extreme.  I had to raise the volume of my TV to 3 times the normal level; then the sound quality was just fine.  Be sure to lower the level back as soon as the video is over!",1380758400,,811,4.36
