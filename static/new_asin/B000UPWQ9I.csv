8214351,5,B000UPWQ9I,"John Schneider (Dukes of Hazzard, Smallville) shows his extraordinary talents as wise-cracking, seemingly mercenary who owns a charter service flying cocaine from Mexico to US. During the movie, the plot unfolds exposing Cliff (John Schneider) as a DEA agent. There is a lot of extreme violence, graphic usage of carnage and blood-letting and four-letter expletives. Definitely not for young children.

However, on the softer side, once Cliff's one-time girlfriend (Katherine Witt) finds out her lover is not the mercenary she suspected, but is, in fact, trying to prevent cocaine trafficking and save lives, she melts in his muscular arms. Their nude love scene is tender and touching, a great contrast to the harsh realities that lie ahead for the DEA agent. Cliff is offered money to kill a would-be political leader, but instead befriends him and saves the man's life to the detriment of his own physical safety.

A very violent torture scene ensues, which for the 1980s, was extremely harsh. With the kind of James Bond luck, Cliff gets a chance to escape while battling it royally with all the Mexican gang cartel. Cliff even has time to help out an ex-patriot (Royal Dano) to get back to the US. The brothel scenes are quite good and funny as a relief to all the excess violence.

Some reviewers may think this is low-budget cheesy B-movie, but as fan of John Schneider's, I found it to be fast-paced and true to life. Fast and Furious is the real name of the CIA/DEA operation to halt the drug trafficking between Mexico and US, and to this end, this movie is an example of the real dangers that our US agents face everyday.

VICW WARS- PG - is an alternate name for the same movie titled COCAINE WARS which is R-Rated. Vice Wars' harsh language and sex scenes are deleted, whereas Cocaine Wars has all the original language and full sex scenes. I give this movie a high rating and recommend it for people who like a lot of action, and a lot of John Schneider. Enjoy!",1345593600,,1975,4.715942028985507
