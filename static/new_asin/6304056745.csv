769056,5,6304056745,"My husband and I are life-long movie-holics and - at least for us - this is one of those films we come back to over and over again.  The 2 main characters both grew up very shy and, although they are both very good looking, intelligent, competent people with excellent careers, each of them constantly struggles inside themselves with their innate shyness and the toll it takes on them.  For anyone sensitive to the subject, it's a beautiful and very satisfying film.  I highly recommend it.",1491004800,2,491,4.686046511627907

769141,4,6304056745,"With most stalker books and movies, the obsessed one, even though he loves some girl more than most guys do their girlfriends or wives, and has plans to spend every spare second of the rest of their lives together, making her the happiest and luckiest girl in the world, is always hindered by that one little thing.  That she isn't interested in him at all, and in fact is quite mean about it and calls him creepy and all kinds of things. So he has to start killing of her pets and friends and stuff as they are clearly what is going wrong. Bed of Roses is a stalker tale with a difference, it's not really a spoiler because the DVD cover image gives it away, but Bed of Roses is a stalker tale, where Lewis the stalker (Christian Slater) has a real shot of getting Lisa the girl (Mary Stuart Masterson) and proving to the other stalkers out there, that the dream can indeed become real.

Lewis is a flower shop deliverer, who just in case you thought pretends he's not into creepy stuff when he's out in public, also likes to attend storytime at the local library where he is the only adult there without a kid.  Anyway he enjoys looking through windows while walking the streets at night and one night who does he see all lit up but a pretty girl? Granted her hair is sculptured in some weird helmet looking design, but still she's hot to him.  So he delivers her some flowers with a blank card at her workplace (after following her there), you'd think you'd just leave the card out all together, but hey what do I know, I'm not down with Stalker procedures.  She of course wonders who they're from, her deadbeat boyfriend doesn't even pretend he sent them, he just tells her why would I consider doing that?  So being that her boss has forced her to have a few days off (she's a workaholic who's excuse for not dumping her current boyfriend is she doesn't have time for a real relationship), so anyway she decides to do some investigating into who sent them by visiting the florist. Only there's no record of an order being sent to her, so she decides to track down the delivery guy where she is told it's Tuesday, so of course as everyone knows, you can find him at storytime.  He of course doesn't confess he's her stalker, just says he can't tell her who it is, because that wouldn't be ethical.  You can see where the plot is going.

It's not a bad stalker movie at all.  In fact if you're the kind of movie watcher who also thinks Bon Jovi's Always is a love song, or requested The Police's Every Breath You Take to play at your wedding, you'll probably think of this as a nice chick flick romance.  Speaking of Bon Jovi, I was kind of expecting their song of the same name as the movie to appear somewhere playing in the background, but it never did.  But overall the soundtrack is quite good and not nauseating, don't worry there's no Dion or Houston on here.  This film is where a nice stalker guy has a great shot at his superficial girl, (she was kind of creeped out by him until she discovered he was rich).  There's also a side plot where the girl doesn't know what date her birthday is because her foster dad refused to tell her.  Not too sure how she would have got a tax file number to get her job, driver's licence, bank account or anything else that requires a birth certificate or proof of birth but you know it's a love story we don't need facts here!  Also her best friend (who really should have had more lines as she was pretty cool, I particularly liked her answering machine message when Lisa rings to see if she sent the flowers ""Hi! Thanks for calling. If you want you can leave a message, but if you don't... I'll understand).  The film didn't seem to know where to go with the I'm career obsessed angle and pretty much just drops that about half way through for the no knowing birthday childhood ramifications stuff to play out and also didn't really go anywhere with the friend's I like to find ugly girls and cast them as the lead in child actor plays like Beauty and the Beast storyline either.  The latter I would think would create heavier self esteem issues in the years that followed if the now older girl ever became aware of the practice, ""Oh Kym that's such a nice thing to do, hey wait a minute, you asked me to play Belle!"")

My favourite line when he's made a heap of food for her, got her a toothbrush and other things that only would occur to someone who had no idea how that looks to some chick you just met, was something like -  ""I noticed the other morning in the cafe you didn't order any breakfast. I wasn't sure if that was because you weren't a breakfast eater  or because you were worried I was going to kill you.""

Also keep an eye out for Gina Torres (Jessica Pearson -Suits) who has a few lines in the Lisa's office a couple of times in the film.",1454112000,,4804,4.308546059933407

769567,5,6304056745,"I purchased this movie because Amazon recommended it for me after I purchased another Christian Slater film (""Untamed Heart"").  I checked out the movie trailer on YouTube and agreed with Amazon's recommendation.

This is a sweet story with a happy ending.  Christian Slater is wonderful as the ""prince charming"" all women look for at one time or another.  However, this movie is only 87 minutes long and the movie trailer, as well as some fan-made videos on YouTube show scenes that are not in this move.  I would love for this move to go on and on, but the meager 87 minutes seem to be chopped and left me feeling like something was missing.  I checked other movie sites and it really is only 87 minutes long --- I guess it was just really terrible editing.",1397865600,,758,4.536764705882353

769882,3,6304056745,"Last night's bargain-rack DVD was ""Bed of Roses"" starring Christian Slater and Mary Stuart  Masterson. To be brief: it was awful. The movie was badly miscast. Neither of the romantic leads seemed believable or convincing. In my opinion, it was a couple that just didn't work and they were placed in a story that was difficult to believe. Slater played the role of a florist and sometime stalker who spotted Masterson in a third-floor window of an apartment building at night, tracked her down and then delivered her a large and beautiful bouquet of flowers at her place of work. Of course, he left no name tag. Masterson, a career businesswoman and the stalkee, then backtracked the flowers and the two finally met. Come on now, you expect us to believe this romantic nonsense? Well, if you do, the stalker and stalkee then became an uneasy on-again off-again couple for the rest of the show with them ending up together. Not much of a story. Unbelievable and uninteresting. The photography was okay, but the sound on my disc was terrible. All in all, the best part of the movie was when the closing credits made a sudden and welcome appearance.

769960,3,6304056745,"After watching this film a couple of times I can't really decide whether I think this film is a story of romance or one of tragedy.  Slater plays a man who runs a flower shop, and he chooses to take the job of delivering flower orders all day long.  One day he crosses paths with a beautiful young woman (Masterson), and he invites he to join him on his rounds.  Against her basic instincts, she accepts and sees the joy that Slater gains from being the bearer of flowers.

Of course they continue to see each other, but as the story and characters continue to develop, we learn that each of them is bearing an unseen burden.  These are burdens that they are unwilling to share, and perhaps even willing to acknowledge.  The question is whether they can overcome those challenges and have a relationship that survives.

The acting is good, and I have to admit that I like both lead actors, and they make a good screen match.  I really like his flower truck too!

All in all a good movie, well worth a look, but most people will not need to see this film more than once.

769961,5,6304056745,"I am not a big fan of romantic movies or rom-coms for that matter. I find most rom-coms utterly formulaic, unreal and inane. Bed of Roses of course, is not a romantic comedy. I guess it falls into the genre of just romance and in spite of that I do really like this film. Yes, it's certainly not ground-breaking. There are times the film seems disjointed... Could it because of the bits and pieces you see in the movie's trailer which are not actually there in the movie? Possibly... I don't know! I do know that the film got a lot of flak when it was released but you know... at 88 minutes run-time, this film is not going to eat up like half of your day and if you just approach it knowing you're gonna be watching an unabashedly romantic movie (all of whom intrinsically have a flaw or two), you might just enjoy the film, the music, the locations etc...

I loved both Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson in this movie. In fact this was the first movie of MSM's which I saw after which I saw movies like 'Fried Green Tomatoes', 'Digging to China' and 'Benny and Joon' just for her. As far as Christian Slater is concerned, I have only seen him in 3 other films - 'Interview with a Vampire', 'The Name of the Rose' and 'Broken Arrow' but I honestly don't think he has ever looked as beautiful and dreamy as he does in 'Bed of Roses'. Lewis, Christian's character, as has been pointed out by several reviewers here, is just perfect - practically every woman's living dream! I mean a guy who personally delivers flowers to people just to see their happy faces, who is so knowledgeable about flowers that he personifies them with adjectives like ""finicky"", who attends story-telling hours with a bunch of kids at the neighborhood library, who reads a book of poetry by the fire while waiting for you to return home, who makes a king-size breakfast for you in the morning *and* drops your clothes off at the cleaners *and* who has this ethereal flower garden on the rooftop in the middle of New York City! I mean come on! Does such a simple, pure-hearted guy with an almost childlike innocence exist in today's day? The character seem almost too good to be true... But I digress...  The premise of 'Bed of Roses' has been much reviled by critics but I loved it. I see it as a modern fairytale - a florist sees a beautiful woman crying by her window one night and sends her a bouquet of flowers the next day to make her happy. When she probes him to tell her who sent her those flowers, he eventually discloses it was him. They spend the day together at the end of which both fall head over heels in love with another. I didn't find this as ridiculous as some others did. In the scheme of things in which this movie was set - in its own universe so to say - and especially with Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson, I got it... I actually thought they looked good together and unlike some who found MSM's performance a bit weak, I actually thought she did a better job than Christian in the film. He just seemed not ""in"" the moment at times... But besides that, I think he assumed the McDreamy part to a tee!

One of the film's undeniable pluses is the background score given by Michael Convertino. The opening credits montage of `Bed of Roses' is one of the most beautiful I have seen with Adam Kimmel's cinematography elevated to another level altogether because of the music accompanying the visuals. I have the soundtrack of the film and in spite of not having Jann Arden's `Insensitive' in it; it is one of best soundtracks I have heard. Convertino's music just lends an otherworldly aura to the film which makes it so distinctive from all the generic background scores you hear in other films.

Having liked this movie so much, I got the DVD. But those (like me) who purchase a movie's DVD for special features will be left wanting a hell of a lot more from this one... There are no real special features to boast about besides the music video of `Insensitive'. There is no director's commentary which I've sort of started assuming as a staple part of any film's special features. There are no deleted scenes. The trailer contains some lines which aren't in the film and the DVD's sleeve hints at a possible full-fledged scene which isn't there in the film - of Christian and MSM having a picnic in Lewis's roof-top garden. It would've been nice to see what was left on the cutting room floor. What is also missing are Interviews with the Cast and Crew and this exists I know for sure because before I saw `Bed of Roses' for the first time on my TV, the movie channel actually aired a segment which contained interviews with MSM and Michael Goldenberg, the director. They spoke about the story and stuff. I don't remember whether Christian Slater was also interviewed. But this segment could just as well have made it inside the special features section. What they could've also included (considering the superior music given by Convertino for this movie) is an Isolated Music Score. That would've been a real bonus but at the very least they should have had the director's commentary and the cast and crew interviews! As it stands now, the special features don't come across as so special. I hope they release a new edition of the film on DVD with special features that remedy the current oversight! But for now just the movie will do... at least for me!",1290556800,,5371,4.494370522006141
769962,2,6304056745,"I am a sucker for a good romantic comedy and thought I'd enjoy this.  What I realized is that it has to have something pleasant to focus on, since the scripts are all predictable.  I've sat through many with Meg Ryan because she is adorable.  Mary Stuart Masterson is not, even though she shuffles, flatfooted in baggy pants the way that Ryan does.  With Ryan the shtick is very cute because she is basically charming and beautiful...even if it does seem like it was stolen from Diane Keaton.

The most interesting thing about Mary Stuart Masterson is her name.  Perhaps she's a fine actress and does well in more serious roles.  But in this,a love story, she fails.  Christian Slater is better but even his down-and-out personal seems awfully fake.

769968,4,6304056745,"""Bed of Roses"" is one of my all-time favorite romance dramas - it is subtle, bittersweet and poignant, a story about two people who despite different backgrounds and approaches to life, find that they are true soulmates after all. Mary Stuart Masterson gives a finely nuanced performance as Lisa,an emotionally crippled woman who finds it difficult to establish real relationships with people because of the emotional scarring experienced in her childhood. She is focused only on making her mark professionally, and seems quite content with life...that is until, Lewis [Christian Slater] comes into her life. A yuppie turned florist, Lewis beguiles and confuses Lisa with his attentions and sensitivity. This is a guy who sends her flowers just because he felt she needed them to cheer her up, a guy who attends children's storytime at the library [not for any perverse reason, but because he truly enjoys it, losing himself in the wonder of the story with an almost child-like expression of awe].

The closer the pair get, the more perturbed Lisa gets, unsure as to her own emotions with respect to Lewis. Things reach boiling point when Lewis takes Lisa home to meet his family during the holidays, with emotional repercussions for the pair.

I felt the theme of emotional healing through true love was subtly portrayed by the two leads who share a credibly on-screen chemistry without being over the top. Nor was it overly sappy - all the elements of this love story was credibly played out and the pacing was just right. I loved the cinematography, especially with the focus on the flowers, the sights and sounds of things around Lewis and Lisa - it beautifully captured the evolving relationship.

Though this never did hit it big at the box-office, it is nevertheless a well-done romance drama that has always managed to tug at my heartstrings, and I've watched it many times over the years. Highly recommended for the romantic at heart.",1242345600,2,1943,4.95398773006135

The first is the fact that Slater's character is bascially introduced as a clingy, stalker-like person who Masterson's character goes out with after only a minimum of concern. The other thing is that she kisses him early and often which seems a little out of place. Other than these two little issues, this is about what you expect out of a romantic movie. It has the the initial infatuation, the eventual fight/breakup and the happy ending.",1237680000,2,669,4.630252100840337

770226,5,6304056745,"I couldn't disagree with the Amazon.com review more!!  I think both Slater & Masterson were wonderful in this movie.  Face it; most of us have been hurt in this life, and a great deal of us NEED saving!  This is a modern-day Cinderella story, about two people who've both suffered in one way or another, and come together, each helping to heal the other.  What could possibly be wrong with that?  Fine...it's sentimental, some parts are a bit of a stretch, but, what do you expect?? It's a MOVIE, and what do you watch a movie for? To be removed from yourself for a while, and ""live"" someone else's life.  And if the story lifts us up at the end, then I say, ""Well done!""  The music is outstanding; if you like the movie, buy the soundtrack.  There are only two disappointments on the soundtrack...""Killing Time"" and ""Nervous Heart"" are jarring and don't go with the rest of the music, and the song ""Insensitive"" is not on it, and definitely should be.  The instrumental parts are wonderful; it's like watching the movie all over again every time you listen to it!",1045699200,9,1064,4.528795811518324
770310,4,6304056745,"This movie should be shelved under ""Sociological Comedy.""  No movie I've seen before or since details the Prince Charming archetype as thoroughly or with matched zeal.  Men are often accused and portrayed as the superficial gender, shallow, and single-minded.  This movie exacerbatingly shows the rarely mentioned superficiality of women.
Christian Slater starts out as a bohemian good guy and slowly becomes a brilliant, rich, monarchal scientist with material goods to spare.  If the reviews here and the woman who rented Bed of Roses when I saw it are any indication, both sexes include large numbers of small-minded sheep following the shepherd of American dreams and jumping beds of green notes, not roses.  Ladies, somewhere out there is your rich guy.  Guys, somewhere out there is your supermodel(see Shallow Hal, Beautiful Women, ""etc, etc, in the midst of life we are in debt, etc"")
It may have been my state of sleep deprivation at the time, but I've not laughed harder at another movie.  This is the movie I put forward as the worst I've ever seen simply for unintentionally making me cry and hunch over in convulsive laughter.
Required viewing.  Made for the female demographic comparable to the male demographics who truly believe in the work of Steven Seagall, Julie Strain, and Shannon Tweed.
What better way to see this piece, than in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DVD video quality?  Brilliant cover art and some fun extras to finish the aimed-at-female-audience brain dissection.  Buy this DVD!!",1035849600,3,1506,5.085365853658536
770311,1,6304056745,"Wow, is this a rotten movie--it is so sickeningly sweet that it will require toothbrushing after watching it. I give it one star for the presence of Mary Stuart Masterson, whom I've always liked. But it never gets past the leaden load of sentimentality that weighs it down throughout. Slater's character is a nice (if rather obsessive) guy, and Masterson's Lisa Walker is a bland professional, and, of course, they (eventually) fall in love without much thrown in their way beyond some mournful navelgazing in the latter third of the flick.
What really kills this story is the lack of any real conflict; the writer likes the characters way too much, so nothing very interesting happens to them. It's the Village of the Nice, Lonely People. I would have liked it better if Walker's world-weary, not-very-quirky ""quirky single friend"" (I can't even remember her name) was the one who actually sent the flowers, because she was secretly in love with Walker, who doesn't even realize it. Then there'd at least be a bizarre love triangle to add some interest, between Friend and Slater and Masterson.
As good an example as any for why movies should have strong conflicts and strong characters, instead of wishy-washy blandness soaked in syrupy sentimentality. Remember your toothbrushes!",1035158400,8,1282,5.05188679245283
770312,4,6304056745,"This is, by far, my favorite romance movie. I'm not a fan of the ""lifetime"" type movies, but I'm a huge Slater fan, so I had to give it a chance. I first saw it on VHS and it's remained one of my favorite movies. I can't think of a better movie to watch with a significant other. It is corny, has cheesy music and a man that's just too good to be true, but give it a chance. I guarantee you it will produce a tear or two the first time you watch it. Also, men, send your lady friend some of those blue roses after you watch it and you too can be a perfect partner.",1002758400,2,564,3.788135593220339

Great love movie of my entire life so far. Nothing beats this yet.

770314,2,6304056745,"Gag, gag, barf, barf--this movie will make you wretch.  First things first, this guy is a stalker.  It would have made a great premise for a horror movie--like Bed of Bloody Roses.  You know the guy sees the girl through her window and keeps sending her roses and roses and roses, then starts killing off people around her one by one.  Anyone in their right mind knows that a guy that met you in this way would not be normal and you wouldn't be all thrilled to meet him.  My advice, if you need to throw up something that possibly made you sick, rent this movie and watch it.  It shouldn't take long.  You may wonder, why did I give it 2 stars.  Well, it inspired that other great movie about Bed of Bloody Roses and I couldn't have thought of this without it.",995414400,4,760,4.229166666666667
770315,5,6304056745,"I can not say enough about ""Bed of Roses."" I would give this 10 stars if I could. Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson were born to play Lewis and Lisa. There's nothing fake about this story. What's so appealing is that this story could happen to anybody. It's about a flower shop owner named Lewis Farrell(played by Slater) who while on one of his nightly walks comes upon a woman standing at her window crying. Feeling sorry for her he follows her to work the next morning and finds out her name is Lisa Walker(played by Masterson).So he pretends to be a delivery boy delivering her flowers. He leaves the card blank because he doesn't want her to know it was him who sent her the flowers. Wanting to know who sent them, Lisa looks on the card and sees where they came from. So she goes to the shop the next day and asks to speak with the person who delivered the flowers. They tell her where to find Lewis, and she goes to talk to him. Well Lewis refuses to tell her who bought them. So she walks away from him, and the next morning he sees her outside the flower shop. He invites her to breakfast and he finally reveals to her that it was he who bought them. Well they start seeing each other,but what Lewis doesn't know is that Lisa has a secret from her past that has left her scard,and afraid to let anyone get close to her. What Lisa doesn't know is that Lewis has a secret of his own. Lisa finds herself falling hopelessly in love with him, but she has built a invisable wall between herself and her emotions because she feels she is unworthy of recieving his love. So she breaks the relationship off, but she learns that she can't live without him, and that life is all about taking chances, and letting go. So she shows up on his doorstep one day with his favorite flowers, and asks him to take her back. As the movie ends and the picture fades you see them in each others arms. I recommend this movie to anyone who believes that anything is possible, and that together any obstacle can be faced.",993427200,12,2013,4.3
770316,5,6304056745,"A very wholesome story that I can't stop watching. I bought two copies yesterday. One for me and one for my daughter. I fell madly in love with Mary and Lewis. Such a sweet love story-I loved the way Lewis allowed her to do the kissing and didn't demand to much of her. It was refreshing to see a man who respected a woman, who was close to his family.  It's such a uplifting movie that anytime that I'm down I put it on.  this is the first time I've ever watch anything over 3 times and I've lost count how many times I've watch this. I've rented UNTAMED HEART today and it's excellent but BED OF ROSES is way above it.  I got on internet and have read all I could find about Christian and plan to watch all his work except the violent movies.  I was just thrilled to see that he has become a christian and I for one will be praying for him.",990057600,5,842,4.023952095808383

770318,5,6304056745,"In a way I don't know why I like this movie so much... nothing much happens, really.  But sometimes these kinds of movies are the best - they kind of just have a certain mood about them, and of course, in this case, a great chemistry between the two lovers, Lewis and Lisa.
Christian Slater's Lewis is not hard to fall in love with, as he admits to a tragedy in his past that changed him into a better man.  Aa[...] Lisa's childhood had not been the best, which adds a nice dose of psychological disturbance to endanger their unique relationship.
As soon as the movie ended, I wanted to see it again!  It is sweet, it is simple, and it is mine on video!",974419200,5,653,4.208
