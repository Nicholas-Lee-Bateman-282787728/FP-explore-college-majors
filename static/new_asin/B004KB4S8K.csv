8432697,5,B004KB4S8K,"This a a dream of a recording.  David Fray seems to have just the right touch for Mozart, not bombastic yet also not treating his music like some precious porcelain that needs to be handled with the utmost care.  There is plenty of passion here and a strength to his playing which I find marvellous.  The same has to be said for the excellent Jap van Zweden who brings the right amount of weight to these scores and the Philharmonia respond with playing of the highest order.  Listening to these performances against one of those so-called ""period""efforts is like entering a different world where the effete sound of the latter just pales into insignificance.  An absolute must if you want to experience the full genius of these works.",1430006400,,735,4.7109375
8432698,5,B004KB4S8K,David Fray is one of my favorite pianists. I love the collaboration with the conductor!,1424822400,,87,4.866666666666666

8432700,3,B004KB4S8K,Be careful if you get this - mine would not cue up to play the concert performance - just shut off. The documentary played fine. It's a shame - this David Fray seems like a natural with Mozart.,1308700800,2,193,4.105263157894737
8432701,5,B004KB4S8K,"The phenomenally talented young French pianist David Fray has given these two Mozart concertos much thought. It is illuminating to watch him in rehearsal  with Jaap van Zweden, so far unknown to me as a Mozart conductor. Van Zweden has produced a remarkable cycle of Beethoven symphonies with the Den Haag Residentie Orchestra (2003), and he excels here as a first-rank Mozart interpreter and sympathetic, unflappable accompanist with a highly responsive - rejuvenated - and spirited Philharmonia Orchestra. The collaboration is felicitous and the results are wonderful: you get not only the rehearsal excerpts, but also the complete recordings (in the famous Abbey Road studios in London in 2010 in excellent sound and film) of these festive concertos. Needless to say: Fray's readings are technically stunning as well as deeply felt, nuanced and thoughtful in every note. He easily outclasses most other contemporary Mozart pianists. After listening many times to this disk (and its companion piece with the Bach concertos and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen), I can only hope that Fray and van Zweden will give us more of the later Mozart concertos.",1308182400,9,1159,5.333333333333333
