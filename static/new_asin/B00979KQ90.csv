5276078,4,B00979KQ90,I loved this DVD.  It's so fun to watch Dan Dailey Dance.  He is one handsome dude.  I enjoyed the story. It was a breath of fresh air.  Jo,1380672000,3,139,3.689655172413793
5276079,5,B00979KQ90,"You Were Meant for Me is a fine motion picture with some really rather good musical numbers thrown in for a great effect! The acting is most convincing and I liked the choreography, cinematography and the background musical score. True, one or two of the background sets looked like Hollywood sets and not the real thing but this is a minor qualm; overall this film is very well done and the storyline held my attention every step of the way.

When the movie begins, we see Chuck Arnold (Dan Dailey) and His Sophisticates giving one of their usual fine performances in Bloomington, Illinois. In the crowd is Peggy Mayhew (Jeanne Crain) who is out on a date with a guy she really doesn't have any feelings for. When Peggy wins a raffle she gets to come up onstage to collect her prize and the chemistry between Peggy and Chuck begins almost instantaneously! They enjoy each other's company so much that Peggy actually follows Chuck and his band to Peoria the next day and it certainly isn't long after that that they are married much to the shock of Peggy's mother Cora (Selena Royle) and father Andrew (Percy Kilbride). Peggy also gets to know Oscar Hoffman (Oscar Levant), the guy who helps Chuck with his bookings on the road.

However, happiness for Chuck and Peggy doesn't last long. Life on the road with Chuck and his band is unfamiliar to Peggy; she yearns for some quality time alone with her husband who begins to neglect her for his work. What makes matters far worse is the very unexpected stock market crash of 1929 which happens only two months after Chuck and Peggy have been married! The way they and the rest of the family handles this economic crisis and the resulting cancelled bookings for the band is certainly interesting; and we see Oscar's way of handling the problem as well. There's more to the plot that I won't write about so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did and the rest of the film shows how all of the issues play out.

Look also for a solid performance by Herbert Anderson as Eddie. Barbara Lawrence does a great job of playing Louise Crain.

You Were Meant for Me is a must-have film for fans of the actors in it and people who enjoy dramas with nicely done musical numbers will not be disappointed.",1378080000,2,2249,4.518427518427519
5276080,5,B00979KQ90,"I remembered it from when I was about 8or9 yrs. old along with other great nostalgia films:
The Window, The Boy with the Green Hair, The Search and was wondering when some of them would turn up on dvd.",1361404800,,201,4.17948717948718
5276081,5,B00979KQ90,"I am a fan of Jeanne Crain, Dan Dailey, and Barbara Lawrence. There is so much style in Dailey's dancing. Now we need ""Give My Regards to Broadway.""",1356220800,5,148,4.321428571428571
5276082,5,B00979KQ90,"I saw this film as a spiritual, almost religous event. Dan Dailey plays with considerable skill and charm a somewhat successful band leader derailed by  the 1929 economic collapse. Jeanne Crain is his much younger and loving wife. Oscar Levant hangs around delivering  brilliant piano work and acerbic charm. Underlining the light presentation is a set of core beliefs encompassing hope, hard work, and good old American know how. I love the film  and related to it personally and professionally.

The DVD transfer from Fox is quite good.",1354147200,25,538,5.079545454545454
5276083,4,B00979KQ90,"This movie is romantic, and it captures that moment in time when men and women respected each other.  Sweet story.",1354060800,14,114,4.7
5276084,5,B00979KQ90,"The story is very like "" The orchastra wives"". It was enjoyable. The dvd was good, good picture and sound. I wish there where more movies like this. I cant stand all the swearing and nudity in movies today. Hollywood really put out good movies in the forties and early fifties.",1351036800,23,277,4.450980392156863

8537257,4,B00979KQ90,Nice depression era film.  Follows the career and marriage of a bandleader from the good times into the market crash.  Lot's of good music and some decent dance numbers.  If you like Dailey or Crain you will enjoy this one.,1405814400,2,223,4.525
8537258,5,B00979KQ90,"I must confess that I am a fan of May-December romances(especially in the traditional sense with an older man and younger woman).  A far superior remake of Orchestra Wives, that hits melodious, pitch-perfect notes as Dan Dailey and Jeanne Crain discover and re-discover one another after a whirlwind romance leads to marriage.  A wonderful classic film.",1391904000,2,353,5.285714285714286
8537259,4,B00979KQ90,"When I was in school, I no doubt saw this in the local theater and loved the story.  Jeanne Crain and Dan Dailey are very expressive actors, and every word is understood.  The music and dancing are excellent!
People in their seventies will enjoy it.",1388966400,3,249,4.511111111111111
8537260,3,B00979KQ90,"I  ordererd this on a whim- nostaglia from hearing my Mom sing this featured song when I was a child.  It is a trip back to simple happy days of 1940's ... a rather silly story with charming stars.  A far cry from the harsh realities of movies made today.  Enjoyable if you can overlook some of the absolute corniest dialogue , acting and plot...!",1384300800,,347,4.292307692307692
8537261,5,B00979KQ90,Jeanne Crain movies  are always so heart warming.  This is a feel good movie and it speaks to a sweeter time and is very enjoyable.,1381104000,3,131,4.2
