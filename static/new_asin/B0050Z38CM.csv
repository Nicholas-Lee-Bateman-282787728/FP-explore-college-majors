4518828,5,B0050Z38CM,"I was devastated when I learned that Netflix, Turner Classic Movies and other sites that used to stock these wonderful old movies, no longer had a copy of ""Margie"". I went to Amazon immediately and they had a source for this wonderful comedy.  I ordered it and I had a copy in about a week. If you remember an old movie from the olden days and would like to own it, do some research with Amazon and I'll bet you can find it.  Of course, you must be from a ""certain generation"" to appreciate the value of these old classics. Young people today may not be interested in a young girl who had trouble with the elastic in her bloomers.",1349481600,12,630,4.241666666666666

4518830,5,B0050Z38CM,"This is still a great movie, but during the last part very grainy, but I enjoyed seeing this old classic,  wish there were more like it. It is a great family movie, full of humor and and a lot of the old stars.
Takes you to a time that was simpler wth less problems of the world.",1348531200,4,279,3.8947368421052633
4518831,1,B0050Z38CM,"Wonderful Movie, Horrible copy!!! Looks like some just made this at home.  I order this for my grandmother, but her VHS copy is much better quality! Waste of money.... :(",1337472000,4,170,4.666666666666667
4518832,5,B0050Z38CM,"Margie has always been one of my favorite films from the first time I saw it on late night television as a young girl. In 1946, Margie is reminiscing with her teenage daughter about how she met and fell in love with her father in 1928 while still in high school. Margie had a secret crush on Johnny, the popular boyfriend of her flirtatious neighbor, Marybelle, while nerdy Roy had a not so secret crush on Margie. Then there was the handsome French teacher, Professor Fontayne, whom every girl in school was openly crushing on. Problem was that every time she encountered one of her crushes, she ended up doing something stupid and badly embarrassing herself, particularly because of a pair of old-fashioned bloomers that refused to remain hidden. All the while, steady best friend Roy is ever at her side. It is never clear, until the very end, when the husband joins his wife and daughter in the attic, just who Margie married, and that is half the fun. The music is also beautiful, although this isn't a typical musical, as the songs are integrated pretty well into the story, without a lot of breaking into song at odd moments. It consists mostly of popular music from the flapper era, with standouts being ""I'll See You In My Dreams"", ""April Showers"", ""My Time Is Your Time"", and ""Coffee, A Sandwich, And You"". The entire cast is utterly perfect, perfect say I! Jeanne Crain manages to capture the coltish awkwardness of a shy, brainy teenager who hasn't quite grown into her body yet. The three men in Margie's life, played by Glenn Langan - the French professor, Alan Young - dependable Roy, and Conrad Janis - ""Johnnykins"",  are all a lot of fun, but a special kudo must go to Alan Young, who has the most difficult role as the nerdy best friend. Esther Dale as the bumptious Grandma McSweeney and Hobart Cavanaugh as the loving but absentee father, Angus MacDuff, have some of the best lines in the film, and it surely seems as if they had a great time, especially in their scenes together. Surprisingly, this was filmed on location in Reno, Nevada, but it looks very similar to the small towns in Ohio where I grew up, and where the story is set. Margie is a wonderful piece of fluff that is exceedingly entertaining from start to finish. Enjoy! It's special!",1329350400,15,2270,4.618811881188119
4518833,4,B0050Z38CM,"From the roaring '20's, when youth was flaming, girls were flappers, boys were shieks, and the Charleston was the national anthem, comes Jeanne Crain as ""Margie."" This is one of Jeanne Crain's best films, and uses her natural charm and retiscence to great advantage.

Margie is a 20's high school girl. She isn't popular, and has a goofy family life, but through a series of adorable mishaps, largely involving a pair of stretched out bloomers, she manages to catch the eye of the hunky new French teacher. (This is the olden days before high school girls were off limits for handsome young teachers).

Crain is ably supported by 20th Century Fox's  top contract players such as Esther Dale as Grandma McSweeney, Hobart Cavannaugh as Margie's undertaker father, leggy Barbara Lawrence as Margie's romantic rival, and Conrad Janis as the dreamiest racoon coat wearing sheik. It is guaranteed you will come away humming a few of the catchiest tunes from the early part of the last century. Based on Ruth McKenney's (My Sister Eileen )story with a surprise ending, Margie is a terrific family film you'll want to watch again and again.",1325462400,9,1132,4.9162303664921465
4518834,5,B0050Z38CM,"I sure wish I could get this on dvd.  I saw it as a child and once one of the classic movie channels ran it and I got to see it with my 12 year old daughter, who loved it.  She is 25 now and I still haven't been able to get it.  The scene at the skating pond is classic and the kind old grandmother is priceless.",1323302400,21,312,3.5588235294117645
4518835,5,B0050Z38CM,just plain fun. my wife and I first saw it in a real movie theater 1n 1946.  we always remembered it for it's lightness and charm and enjoyed it all the more 65 years later. a good movie for kids of all ages.,1322179200,16,208,3.8372093023255816
4518836,5,B0050Z38CM,"I saw ""Margie"" with Jeannie Crain years ago on Turner Classic Movies on TV.  I can't believe this excellent family movie hasn't been put on DVD yet!!!!!!!  It's one of her very best movies...& beautifully written...& so entertaining!!!
PLEASE HURRY UP & PUT THIS ON DVD!!!!  I have been waiting for YEARS to see this movie again...& to share it with my children & grandchildren!!!",1321833600,34,380,4.815384615384615
4518837,5,B0050Z38CM,I have been searching for this movie for years but had no chance of locating it until I happened to find it by accident on Amazon.com. This movie was a favorite of mine when I was a young girl and so much fun to view it once more.,1314403200,33,230,3.8125
4518838,5,B0050Z38CM,My daughter and I first saw this movie when she was a teenager still living at home.  We laughed and laughed.  I just had to buy it and make it part of my classics collection.,1401753600,2,175,3.9714285714285715

4518840,5,B0050Z38CM,"I am so happy to finally get the DVD of this wonderful movie.  I remember seeing it for the first time when I was a young girl in high school.  I know that I will spend hours watching and enjoying the whole movie again and again.  It's a shame that the shows of today cannot begin to compete with the older movies.  It seems like today the writers only know one subject and that is sex,---- too bad.  Some of us like other subjects, too, and the older movies provide that education.",1399075200,3,482,4.195652173913044
4518841,3,B0050Z38CM,"I was not satisfied with the quality of the movie. Some of the scenes were too dark, it cut characters off.",1374451200,2,107,4.142857142857143
4518842,5,B0050Z38CM,"I loved this movie back in 1946 when I was in high school; I still love it, and was delighted to find that it's now available (after many years when it wasn't.)  It's a good family film, charming, very 40's--and very 20's, when living seemed lots easier--or uncomplicated by technology--than it is now.  Some of today's kids might find the story ""hokey"", some might see it and wish life was that simple again.  It certainly illustrates the vast differences, and some similarities, in the lives of teens and their families then and now.  Jeanne Crain is a delight; I'll never mistake Glenn Langan's voice--it was his asset as much as his looks.  The opening and closing device is good--mother and daughter reminiscing about the past.  How nice that that is still happening between mothers and daughters--and sons, too!",1371513600,5,817,4.884057971014493

8452047,5,B0050Z38CM,"I love this movie.  Jeanne Crain is amazing.  It's definitely dated, especially getting into student/teacher romances.  The high school is the University of Nevada Reno way back in the 1940's.  Some of the landmarks are the same.

My dad and I took in a showing at one of the casinos about 15 years ago and being 30 and 60, respectively, we were the youngest viewers.  There were a lot of cast and crew from the movie that were lost in time reminiscing about how things changed, what buildings were used and how the freeway has displaced the houses.  Ralston Street is clearly visible and still accessible today.",1444176000,3,612,4.663551401869159
8452048,5,B0050Z38CM,"I am a big collector  of all of the old movies and especially the musicals.  I saw Margie on TV probably 30 years ago and I fell in love with the movie.  I would love to find a copy on DVD to add to my collection and enjoy sitting down and watching it again.  Amazon has been the best place to go to find these old movies in print.  I have bought a lot of them here. I like other kinds of movies and have a large collection but my favorites are the old musicals, they usually have a cute story with them but the music is awesome.",1422662400,,529,3.861111111111111

8452052,1,B0050Z38CM,Cheap home made and didn't even play. It was not the real thing.,1413331200,,64,4.0
8452053,5,B0050Z38CM,First saw this years ago. Loved the late Jeanne Craine. The script of a young girl growing up in a small town in the 1920's is full of clean humor. I especially loved her comments about American intervention in Central America and how it encouraged her father to become involved. It helps us see how things were already getting out of hand. Loved it and will watch it again.,1407888000,2,374,4.434782608695652
8452054,5,B0050Z38CM,"Margie was always one of my faavorite movies and I was very happy to see it available on DVD.  However, the quality of the DVD was poor and had glitches after the first playing on my TV set.  I have two TV's with players and it occured on both.  I can play it on a portable DVD player but it shouldn't be that way.",1403740800,2,314,3.875
