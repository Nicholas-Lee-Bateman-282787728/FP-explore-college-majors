2191277,4,B0006Q948W,"This film was a great local LI film that captured life in the late 80s-early 90s for the early twenty something crowd. It pertains to the wealthier southshore in Nassau. There's a bit of the guido element at work here too. The film is well done with a cool soundtrack. The three main characters give us a trinity of characterization.  You have the good guy, and most likable and down to earth, who's gone through a transformation after being in prison. You have the guy in the middle who will be changed in the end. And then you have the big shot guy who bullies everyone around. In only her third film, Mira Sorvino plays a love interest for one of the men.",1362873600,3,658,4.349593495934959

2191280,4,B0006Q948W,"Amongst Friends is an urban classic, especially in the New York area. I cannot believe it has been nearly 20 years since this film was released. It has since become an underground classic that can bring any Generation X'er back to the good old days. This was another film that made me think ""I know these guys"". Director Rob Weiss did a great job on this movie and really created a time capsule for the early 90's in New York. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a gangster film, rather a film about confused young men who think they are gangsters. Absolutely worth seeing and I own a copy of the DVD for my personal collection.",1326240000,2,629,4.294117647058823
2191281,5,B0006Q948W,"Amongst Friends is Rob Weiss' first film, which has had a cult following since it came out in 1993.  I had it on VHS and wore it out.  I was very pumped that is finaly came out on DVD.  It is one of my favorite movies!  Watch it for yourself.",1234656000,2,242,3.78
2191282,5,B0006Q948W,"A great film written and directed by five town native Robert Weiss who now produces and writes for ""Entourage"" and financed partially by the Sorvino family to debut young Mira Sorvino (her first flick); the movie takes place in early nineties Long Island, New York.
A snapshot in time; the movie opens up with a house party blaring ""Brass Monkey"" out of the stereo. Anyone in their thirties will love this movie and three times as much if you are from New York City or Long Island.
The best films don't just make the story and the characters the foundation of the film but also the setting and Robert Weiss was genius in portraying the early nineties living in New York.
Also one of the best and most suited soundtracks I can think of.",1228608000,2,735,4.492537313432836
2191283,5,B0006Q948W,"This original and well made gangster drama works out as a modern urban fable and it tells about the times and lives of three young teenagers seduced by the easy money with the very predictably consequences you may expect.

If ""The wanderers"", and then the famous French film ""The hate""  were if I may two of these new mature films about the led out youth, a sort of self revision and exploratory study in the line of ""Rebel without cause"" , this movie goes much more far, in this sense. You should not never forget the Nineties knew about three giants gangsters movies: ""Goodfellas"", ""State of grace"" and ""Miller's crossing"" . Nevertheless, this film might be included in a reduced list of the ten best films of this notable decade that knew about the reappearance of this genre.

Recommended without restrictions.",1216166400,,814,4.75886524822695
2191284,5,B0006Q948W,Mira Sorvino is so beautiful in this movie .this movie is worth watching. It has a nice soundtrack to. I waited patiently  but finally on DVD.,1119830400,2,142,4.461538461538462
2191285,3,B0006Q948W,"I was refered to this film by a friend, I being a mafia buff, so I went out and rented it back in the stone age when VCR was not an endangered species. The film takes a look at the key elements of most films that have a lot or very little to do with the mob. The Five Burroughs, the breeding ground of many mafia soldiers and leaders, and a group of friends, all of them with different ambitions. You have your power hungry friend, the fool who wants power but doesn't know how to go about getting it, and of course the friend who despises where he comes from and wants to leave it all behind. Throw in your mafia element offering power at a price and then watch the characters scatter. Betrayal, murder, and coming of age all wrapped up in a nice little package. If you end up liking this film check out The Funeral with Christopher Walken and Benicio Del Toro or State of Grace starring Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, and a slew of other known talents. Those films are a lot like this one, maybe even better.",1108080000,,1003,4.2020725388601035

8042383,1,B0006Q948W,"Actually, I hate to say it but I remember this film being ALOT better when I'd first seen it 20 years ago. The fact that they got Mira Sorvino to do it and add some ""Star Power"" was surprising. It just wasn't done well. VERY GOOD idea though to show a bunch of rich long island kids (especially from that area) doing that. You can completely picture that. I would skip this one.",1469577600,,378,4.191780821917808
