3159,5,0740318764,The whole family loves drive through dvd's and this one seems to be endowed with an extra dose of humor. I loan these dvd's out to all my friends. Maybe I should start charging rent?,1397433600,6,182,4.228571428571429
3160,5,0740318764,History should be told and it should be told truthfully.  The kids think these are funny and they are learning at that same time.  What better way to learn then when you are laughing.  My kids laugh and learn at the same time and that is a great way to learn.,1326412800,10,259,4.03921568627451
3161,5,0740318764,Dave Stotts and Focus on the Family hit another home run!  The entire series should be at least shown to school aged kids and it is great entertainment (and informative) for we adults too.,1293494400,13,188,4.529411764705882
3162,5,0740318764,"This video is an excellent supplement for American History studies, or anyone interested in learning about America's history.  It would be ideal for home schoolers.  Dave Stotts is goofy, but enjoyable to listen to and watch, as he sometimes dresses for the occasion or place to which he is visiting or talking about.  Seeing the video will make you want to visit for yourself.",1284940800,16,377,4.859375
3163,1,0740318764,"I ordered several DVDs on early American history for my daughter.  We loved the PBS and Biography ones; this one was not to our taste.  First, the jokes are silly: he can't say croissant, he squeezes canned cheese on a croissant, he takes a call from his wife and asks for his snoopy toothbrush and spiderman underroos, etc.  Perhaps the intended audience is 4-6 year olds.  Second, they do not have the strongest historians on their writing staff.  e.g. He makes fun of Abigail Adams for her poor spelling, when at that time, spelling was not standardized.  You could make fun of the other founding fathers for the same flaw.  If you know American history, this DVD will drive you crazy with all the little mistakes...
p.s. this is presented by the National Day of Prayer.",1283904000,10,773,4.639705882352941
3164,5,0740318764,"I HIGHLY recommend the Drive Thru History (DTH) Discovering America's Founder Video, as well as ALL the Drive Thru History Programs. Dave Stotts has done an excellant job making history come alive, as well as make sense. Dave has a wonderful way of bringing these charaters come to life and how they relate to each other. A couple are relatives of mine, it was fun getting to know them, through this DVD. I've always appreciated history, but never in my 60 plus years of life, enjoyed learning it, until the Drive Thru History Programs. I stumbled across his program, when he first started on TV. His narrative made learning history fun for me, as well as connected history together, which may be the biggest difference. History text books did much to dry up my interest in History, where the DTH series woke up my desire for learning & understanding history. Great Job Dave & your fantastic team! Thanks for also providing a school program that will stimulate children (and adults) to understand our world's past. We have ALL the DTH DVDs and have purchased many as gifts.
Drive Thru History DVD's have always been appreciated gifts...All Programs/Episodes/Series are winners!!",1265414400,27,1178,4.924623115577889

Its difficult to watch in segmented because there is no true ""stopping point"" and is very long.
