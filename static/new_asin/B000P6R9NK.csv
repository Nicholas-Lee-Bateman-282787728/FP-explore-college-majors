2811932,2,B000P6R9NK,"Knowing what will happen never lessens the fun when a protagonist is out to even a score. In fact, that's what makes these kind of films so enjoyable. But this well-crafted and smartly cast thriller never amounts to much. It is so reserved in delivering its payoff that one of the victims is actually left with an achy arm. That's the revenge! Gotcha - your arm hurts! I won't ruin the fate of the principal character, but the delivery of her comeuppance is also wanting. While I'm not a fan of our lack of subtleness here in the States - a remake would probably have Melanie running around with a machete - this thriller could have been greatly improved with a racier denouement. Instead the film walks to a whimper.",1198540800,7,717,4.523076923076923
2811933,4,B000P6R9NK,"Thanks to the people of France--who, by electing Nicholas Sarkozy as their president, have finally come to their senses and reversed the course of national suicide on which they were careening--I can now avail myself of that nation's fine products, which I hitherto had been boycotting. I am now free to gorge on toasted Camembert and to wash it down with my favorite Bordeaux, Mouton Cadet Ros. My little boy Evan can now laugh at the Looney Tunes exploits of Pepe Le Peu. More significantly, I am able once again to treat myself to Gaul's outstanding film exports.

Just in time, too: Writer and director Denis Dercourt's The Page Turner is a brilliant gem of filmmaking. Initially, I anticipated the prospect of watching it with some trepidation, because the poster touted a suspense movie in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock and Claude Chabrol. Usually, such advertising hype bears little relation to what's actually on the screen: hack work by semi-competent directors with only the vaguest understanding of what makes a movie suspenseful, and whose pictures bear only superficial resemblance to the films of such celebrated masters of suspense. Fortunately, such is not the case here. The Page Turner is a brilliantly paced psychological flick that recalls Hitchcock's Marnie; but more than any film by Chabrol, it instead reminded me of Franois Truffaut's revenge thriller The Bride Wore Black.

 Dborah Franois, in just her second leading role (her excellent debut was in The Child in 2005), is icily persuasive as Mlanie Prouvost, an alluring, duplicitous femme fatale. As the credits dissolve, we find her as a young girl of eleven, practicing the piano in the comfortable bourgeois flat above her parents' butcher shop, hoping to win a coveted scholarship to a musical conservatory. Her later audition, however, is rudely interrupted when a classical-music fan rudely asks a jury member, famed pianist Ariane Fouchcourt (Catherine Frot), for an autograph. Unable to pick up where she left off, Mlanie fumbles her way through the rest of the piece. She leaves the audition fuming, returns home, and then puts away the bust of Beethoven that graced her family's upright piano, presumably forever.

We next see Mlanie as an attractive young lady working as a filing clerk at a Paris law firm. Although seemingly demure, she projects intense determination in her hard-set eyes. She quickly obtains a position from her boss (Pascal Greggory) as nanny for his son at his country estate. Soon, we learn the reason why: M. Fouchcourt's wife is the same famous musician whose insensitive autograph-signing a decade earlier had crushed Mlanie's career dream of becoming a concert pianist.

Mlanie insinuates herself into the family's daily life. She goes beyond her job description to help their son Tristan (Antoine Martynciow) with his piano studies and also becomes Ariane's assistant. Unlike the arrogant virtuoso of ten years before, Ariane has been shaken by an automobile accident and humbled by a case of nerves and stage fright. As if on cue, Mlanie volunteers her services as Ariane's page-turner. Because of her pianistic knowledge, she proves herself an adept, sensitive collaborator during rehearsals of the trio to which Ariane belongs, and she quickly wins the older woman's trust and friendship.

Mlanie is as calculating as the title character played by Anne Baxter in All About Eve. Methodically, she exploits the situation through a series of connivances that places Ariane in a desperate state of dependence upon her charge. But, ironically, Mlanie is by now completely oblivious to the bounties of fame and fortune that she once so passionately sought; her sights are set solely on Ariane's demise.

Usually, a revenge tale is meant to instill cathartic emotions, either for a hero who has undone a great evil (such as Charles Bronson in Death Wish) or against a villain who's gone too far (think Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction). However, director Dercourt does not let Mlanie off so easily. There is no catharsis offered here--only stasis.

I found both Franois's portrayal of Mlanie and her visual depiction to be quite unsettling. We witness a young girl bearing a grudge for half her brief life, for a slight that any sane person would have gotten over in a few months, perhaps a year, and then moved on. Now, outside the context of her plot against Ariane, her life is pitifully empty, her lonesome existence preoccupied with quotidian household tasks and perfunctory phone calls to her parents. Fixated upon righting a largely imagined wrong, Mlanie has permanently, irrevocably robbed herself of any semblance of a productive and fruitful future. The pages she turns are only those in a piano score; but the hatred that motivates that activity fates her never to turn over a new page in her own life.

Photography director Jrme Peyrebrune's shots are nearly all static, objective; this tale of deceit is told almost entirely through editor Franois Gdigier's exactingly tight montage of images. Composer Jrme Lemmonier's minimalist score for strings stresses Mlanie's monomaniacal obsession and further notches up the tension. The use of Schubert's ""Notturno"" trio and Shostakovich's agitated Second Piano Trio serves as brilliant counterpoint in foreshadowing her evil intentions: Ariane, her violinist, and her cellist are oblivious to Mlanie's ploy; but by juxtaposing the young protg's fixed stare with the slashing strings and percussive piano beat, director Dercourt skillfully evinces her ruthless cruelty.

The Page Turner demonstrates how placing one's self-esteem at the mercy of another will sabotage any hope of actually attaining it. It's a film that compels thought long after you've left the theater--and it's simultaneously the most tantalizing suspense movie I've seen since David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner. Its particular genius is that in an age when so many directors try to overwhelm the viewer with special effects and cinematic pyrotechnics, Denis Dercourt is able to send a shiver right through us by means of the forgotten arts of dramatic understatement and virtuosic montage.",1190678400,8,6135,5.219289340101523
2811934,4,B000P6R9NK,"""LaTourneuse de pages"" aka ""The Page Turner"", (2006) directed by Denis Dercourt is a clever, elegant, entertaining French psychological drama/revenge/thriller, short but satisfying. It was made by a writer/director who has been a professional musician, both a performer and a teacher, who knows and loves classical music and makes it a very important part of all his movies. Prlude en r mineur by Johann Sebastian Bach and Shostakovich's opus 67, trio in E minor that sound in ""The Page Turner"" are marvelous.

The film brings to mind such excellent and diverse films as ""The Piano Player "", ""Notes on a Scandal"", and ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant"" but it is very good on its own terms thanks to the pitch perfect performances by two main characters and supporting cast and exquisite subtlety in exploring the familiar subject of long awaited and perfectly executed revenge. 19 years old Belgian actress Dborah Franois gives an absolutely stunning performance as Mlanie Prouvost, a self-possessed, attractive, efficient, and well mannered young woman with a sweet quiet smile, refined soft voice, graceful movements, impeccable taste and appreciation for fine quality of things. Mlanie is very observant, smart, and it did not take her long to become an indispensable asset, a trusted page turner for her new boss, Ariane Fouchecour (Catherine Frot). Ariane is a renowned concert pianist who now performs in a trio and is vulnerable and fragile after having survived an auto crash. Little did Ariane know that the girl who had charmed the whole family with her tactfulness, efficiency, and loyalty, has a long memory that goes as far as ten years back when young Melanie (Julie Richalet also gave memorable performance as young Melanie) dreamed of becoming a famous pianist, tried to pass the Conservatory entrance exam with Ariane as a president of the jury. Melanie got distracted by Ariane having signed an autograph for a fan during her performance and failed the exam. She never touched the piano again and she never forgot the day and the person that had changed her life ...

Both actresses were outstanding, and Franois was a revelation in her only second role which is also her second award winning performance in the row. One of the reviewers mentions that she ""almost out-Hupperts Isabelle Huppert"" as the page turner. The gifted young actress justly deserves this praise. I hope that she has a great future ahead of her and I will be waiting for her following movies.",1190592000,2,2485,5.014527845036319
2811935,5,B000P6R9NK,"A first-rate French film certain to be admired by fans of Chabrol and Hitchcock's ""Vertigo.""

When we first meet Melanie Prouvost in director Denis Dercourt's creeptastic ""The Page Turner,"" she's a preteen, daughter of a butcher, who's hoping to get a piano scholarship. As she is playing for the panel of judges, one of them, Ariane, a famous pianist (well played by Catherine Frot), is interrupted by a request for an autograph, and as she pauses to sign it Melanie pauses too. Ariane encourages the girl to go on, but she loses her concentration, fails to get the scholarship, and commits a sudden act of minor violence as she leaves the audition facility (the first sign that she's not wired exactly right). She goes home, puts away her pallid bust of Beethoven, locks up her piano, and that's pretty much the end of her piano-playing career.

We next see her as a young adult about to embark on a legal career. Now played by the fascinating Deborah Francois, Melanie is planning on a legal career. She's summer-interning at a law firm, and soon discovers that the head of the firm, who has an estate in exurban Paris, is in need of a caretaker for his son during the month of November, by which time her internship will be over. She volunteers.

As Melanie arrives at the train station she's met by, mais certainment, none other than Ariane, who of course she still blames for ending her piano career. Ariane apparently does not recognize her. Melanie quickly insinuates herself into the household and manages to get a gig as the page turner for the woman who, as we now learn, was a world-class pianist whose career has been interrupted after an auto accident has left her traumatized. She's trying to get herself back on track by playing a radio concert with her colleagues, a couple who play respectively the violin and cello.

All kinds of havoc ensues as the film shivers on. Melanie, who says little throughout, is determined to get her own back. Deborah Francois portrays Melanie as a coiled snake, always ready to strike (the only time she seems other than foreboding and forbidding is when she encounters one of her old classmates in a clothing store when Ariane buys her a dress to wear for a concert). And when she does strike, she does it quickly and decisively. She never forgives; she never forgets; and she never explains.

Notes and Asides: The accompanying ""making of"" feature is well worth looking at.",1189641600,2,2424,4.721040189125295
2811936,3,B000P6R9NK,"""The Page Turner"" brings to mind the work of French master filmmaker Claude Chabrol, Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher"" and ""The Bad Seed"". It's an odd mixture and ""The Page Turner"" doesn't quite live up to any of them but that's okay, because what it does do it does well enough where the film is entertaining.

 Melanie Prouvost (played as a child by Julie Richalet and as an adult by Deboran Francois) has a love of music. She studies the piano every day. She comes from a moderate income family, her parents are butchers. They do what they can to support Melanie in her piano studies. One day at a competition Melanie will meet fammed pianist Ariane Fouchecourt (Catherine Frot). While Melanie is playing her piece Ariane gives a fan her autograph. This throws the young girl off and thus her playing suffers.

 It is at that exact moments Melanie decides to never again play the piano. Why put all that time and effort into something which she will never excell at?

 Years go by and now Melanie has grown into a beautiful woman looking for an intership at a law firm run by Jean (Pascal Greggory). It turns out Jean is looking for someone to watch his son as he heads out of town and keep an eye on his wife, whom after a car accident has become very sensitive and dependent on others.

 Seeking a chance for career advancement perhaps Melanie agrees and as the fates would have it, Jean's wife turns out to be Ariane. At this point Ariane does not recongize Melanie but there's no mistaking Melanie knows who she is.

 You don't have to be a genuis to figure out where the film is going to go. Melanie wants some revenge on the woman who destroyed her life and took the one thing which gave her enjoyment.

 The film, directed by young filmmaker Denis Dercourt, is tightly scripted and paced. There is not much excess fat to what is on screen. The film runs 80 minutes, so no time is wasted getting to the heart of the story. Yet, somehow I felt cheated. There are big payoffs we expect to happen but the film teases us. We think we are going to go down certain paths and we are never taken down them. Was it a sly move or a rookie mistake?

 If we compared the film to Chabrol's work or ""The Piano Teacher"" Melanie isn't as cold as Isabelle Huppert. It could be because of the age difference the two. Huppert has made a lenghty career playing the cold hearted, blank expressioned woman with murder on their mind. But the film in general isn't nearly as ""evil"" as it should be. Melanie should be inflicking more damage to these people. She isn't as ruthless as I would have liked her to be. She has seeds, glimmering moments when she shows hints of true evilness, but it never becomes full-scale cold hearted vindictiveness.

 The film still is worth seeing. Overall the performances are worth watching. Catherine Frot is convincing has a one time great pianist who now depends on the kindness of strangers and Pascal Greggory plays the upper-class, boring husband quite well. Just as he did in ""Gabrielle"". And Francois is clearly an up and coming talent. She was in ""L' Enfant"" and nominated for a Cesar (France's Oscar) award for ""most promising actress"". The film was also nominated for ""best actress"" (Frot). Plus Dercourt has talent. He's not at Claude Chabrol level yet but with time it will come.

 Botom-line: Nicely made thriller with a good cast. Near the ends feels like a bit of a letdown because it doesn't deliver on certain payoffs we were expecting. Still, whatever the film does it does well.",1185494400,5,3519,4.541139240506329
2811937,4,B000P6R9NK,"French film `The Page Turner' plays at a perfect pace.  Methodically, we get a drama about lost opportunities that have movements of significance in people's lives.  As a composite the story hits all the right notes.

Melanie (Deborah Francois) is a child prodigy.  She awaits her big chance to make it as a pianist.  At a large try-out, she plays beautifully until someone walks in with a photo for one of the judges to sign.  Then, she falters.  From that heartbreaking moment, the film leaps ahead to a movement in her life many years later when she gets a job as a secretary apprentice at a law firm.  Neatly, she overhears that her employer, Jean (Pascal Gregory) needs a caretaker for Tristan, his only son.  He instantly accepts her overture to fill the position, and her whole life changes.  In their countryside mansion outside of Paris, she hooks up with all the charm of being a caretaker and assistant.  Since both of Melanie's parents are butchers, she takes easily to cooking fare for the family.  Her role expands, though.  Luck has it that his wife, Ariane (Catherine Fro) is a concert pianist, and Melanie is able to give Tristan some piano lessons.  From here her meticulousness lends itself to other privileged duties up to and including the entrusted role of page turner for Ariane's consequential radio concert.  Like a fairy tale, they both bond, and Ariane assists Melanie with make-up and perfume.  Melanie has a special touch to encourage Tristan to push himself and help Ariane to get over her trepidation to perform after a car accident two years earlier made her falter on stage.  Can Ariane and Melanie deliver each other from their past?

Everything doesn't always go well, but the development and outcome are meant to be seen.  'The Page Turner' reminded me of the sort of movie that could easily become a hall-of-fame winner for 'The Lifetime Channel'.  With subtlety and understatement, 'The Page Turner' is indeed a classic.",1184025600,20,1958,4.840361445783133
2811938,5,B000P6R9NK,"Tight as a clenched fist ready to bloody someone's eye, intelligent, crystal clear in its intentions and actions, Denis Dercourt's terrific ""The Page Turner"" is wicked, perverse and anti-social in the very best sense. Like the best anti-heroes, Melanie Prouvost (a chilly, single-minded, Deborah Francois) knows what she wants, knows what/who her target is and knows how to achieve her goals. And in this case her target is the famous, though emotionally and professionally fragile classical pianist, Ariane Fouchecourt (sexy, sophisticated, sleek, tragic Catherine Frot) and by extension Ariane's family: husband Jean (Pascal Greggory) and her son, also a pianist, Laurent.
Melanie is out for total annihilation and her methods are as subtle as a Cobra ingesting defenseless small birds: there is no way that her prey can escape.
Director/Screenwriter Dercourt has fashioned a film that is tightly paced (a mere 94 minutes, not one ounce of fat here) and expertly acted but what is particularly impressive in its humanity and its knowing appreciation of the workings of the human mind is the reason, the impetus for Melanie's campaign against Ariane.",1176940800,30,1151,5.3646408839779
2811939,3,B000P6R9NK,"The Page Turner is a typically low-key Gallic thriller. The plot progresses slowly - perhaps a little too slowly at times - but builds to a satisfying denouement. However, I couldn't help wonder if Mlanie isn't too emotionally repressed to be able to maintain the desire for revenge for so long. Maybe I'm misreading the character, but ten years is a long time to let such anger fester and she seems too cold to care for that amount of time. It's also somewhat predictable: you can guess what's likely to happen quite early on. Aside from these shortcomings, the performances are excellent and, despite the slow pace, the film always holds the viewer's attention.",1259452800,,663,4.824561403508772
2811940,3,B000P6R9NK,"I gave 3 stars for the acting and the execution, and because I didn't look at my watch.

Spoiler alert: It's a little hard to believe that a young girl would hold a grudge that long and then act on it against people who never did her any intentional harm.  After all, the girl is from a loving, happy, hard working, well-adjusted family, so the malicious behavior is rather out of the blue -- maybe it was a class thing, a meaningful concept in France.  Besides, I know a thing or two about music and I can tell you for a fact that little Melanie's piano playing was only a cut above chopsticks, and would have been told that by her teacher.  Entering a competition is only done if one has the talent and the confidence, which Melanie did not.

What would have been interesting is to pursue Ariane's transformation once she realizes she's in love with Melanie, including the effect on her marriage and her husband.  The two ladies are perfecttly cast and are clearly highly competent as actresses and could have pulled off portraying a believable relationship, if only the director had let them.  Alas, he decided to go for the revenge angle and leave it at that.  Too bad.

Incidentally, the husband is a big time lawyer in this film, wealthy and powerful.  I'm predicting that Melanie will have a hard time finding suitable employment after this fellow gets done exacting his revenge.  As for the fellow who will marry Melanie, well, dude ...",1252195200,2,1444,4.57976653696498
2811941,2,B000P6R9NK,"Spoiler warning: Why this young lady would hold such a vendetta, including promoting physical damage of a youth, over a slight at a piano competition is proposition that outstretches credulity.  The story has a decent structure, and the choreography of a thriller, but virtually a complete absense of tension and suspense.  Furthermore, the characters are all cold and the audience cannot embrace sympathy.  Thumbs down.",1239840000,2,420,5.430769230769231
2811942,2,B000P6R9NK,"You know, France has made many excellent thrillers with psychological depth underlying its apparently incredible, but still intriguing plot like ""Les Diaboliques.""  If ""La Tourneuse de pages"" had been directed by someone like Henri-Georges Clouzot or Claude Chabrol, it might have been a great thriller As it is, we have to be content with the so-so direction of Denis Dercourt, who knows how to show the details of each scene, but not of the story.

[MILD SPOLIER INCLUDED IN THIS PARAGRAPH] The story is interesting. A young, quiet girl Melanie, daughter of a local butcher, wanted to be a pianist. But her dream was shattered because of the inconsiderate behavior of one juror during the competition. Well, that's how she thinks. Years later, grown-up Melanie shows up before the very person (who herself is a pianist) as a part-time nanny, and then sits by her as ""page turner."".

This kind of story has a certain kind of format, so most people can predict what is coming in the final chapter. That is not a problem at all. What is really important is the way the film leads us to the ending and that is where ""La Tourneuse de pages"" disappoints us. The film suggests Melanie's rather simple plans and Melanie just does what she is supposed to do. Everything goes too smoothly; no twist, no surprise.

Despite several nice touches given to the details of the characters' traits, the film fails to explore the psychological aspects which the seemingly impossible story has: ""What kind of people can hold a grudge against someone for such a long time?"" ""How do such people manage to be trusted by the very person they hate?"" or ""Why do such people rely on such a contrived and risky method?"" and so on. Without insights into these questions, the thriller becomes only an awfully implausible potboiler, which the film actually becomes.

Still I must say the two leading ladies did a fine job. The director is very lucky as he could cast Catherine Frot and Dborah Franois as the leads. They make the detailed descriptions of the characters they play more convincing - Melanie's relation with the juror's young son, which occasionally reveals the hidden side of her personality, is one good example - but as a whole the film is a missed opportunity to create a more engrossing thriller.",1214438400,4,2285,4.789340101522843

2811944,4,B000P6R9NK,"The film begins with 10-year-old Melanie Prouvost's preparations for a piano recital that could win her a place in a prestigious Parisian conservatory.  She informs her working-class parents that she will quit the piano if she doesn't succeed.  During the audition, a judge is asked for an autograph and this distraction causes Melanie to flub her piece.  Angered by this perceived slight and convinced of her lost opportunity, she forever gives up her ambition.  The story fast-forwards to ten years later and Melanie is now an intern in a law firm.  She overhears her boss saying that his son needs a nanny.  Melanie gets the job.  We find out that the boss' wife is none other than the judge who caused her to fumble at the recital, Ariane Fouchecourt, a renowned pianist.  Ariane is a fragile woman whose confidence at concerts eroded after an auto accident.  Melanie ingratiates herself with Ariane and the life of the Bourgeoisie that Melanie can only imagine.  In short order she becomes Ariane's trusted page-turner at concerts and a much-needed source of affection.  We assume Melanie is acting out a part, biding her time, waiting for the opportune moment to exact her revenge.  We don't know when, we don't know how, we just know it'll happen.

""The Page Turner (La tourneuse de pages)"" is not an average revenge thriller.  Sans bloodshed, hysterics and action, the thrills here are tepid compared to what we're accustomed to in American films, but it is the very absence of these elements that makes the revenge itself unique and satisfying.  It is bone-chillingly delivered in an elegant package topped with a creepy bow.  It is the kind of cerebral horror that the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock, would have wanted to make a cameo appearance in...after he's made some script changes and given director Denis Dercourt a few lessons, mind you.

At barely 80 minutes, the film gets to its meaty part rapidly, soon after the few and slow developments that don't necessarily terrify, but do make one nervous.  The young Belgian actress, Deborah Francois as Melanie, is a study in understatement.  Hardly reacting, blonde and cold, she's the epitome of beauty and menace combined.  Catherine Frot, as Ariane, is a quivering bowl of Jell-O that doesn't quite gel, a tad difficult to accept that such an accomplished artist would allow a mere snip of a girl to overtake her life with nary a suspicion.

There is a subtext in this film, which I hope is not revealed as it is upon which the revenge hinges.  Some have seen it as deficient, but it is what warranted my appreciation.  The settling of scores, when it comes, is nothing as mundane as murder, and its effect is more devastating when compared to the quick release of death.

Comparisons to Claude Chabrol's films have been made, particularly to ""La Ceremonie"" (an adaptation of Ruth Rendell's `A Judgment in Stone').  Not quite.  La Ceremonie was a tragedy that fully explored the circumstances behind the perversity of its characters.  The Page Turner does not.  We are left only to accept, without doubt, that a 10-year-old would have the wherewithal to nurse a grievance for so long and plan an annihilation ten years down the road.  That is one messed-up kid.

Second, to give up the piano just because you don't like what ONE judge does or says tells us the kid is ""not right in the head!"" But to stew about a minor slight for 10 years is serious mental illness.

Very lovely eye candy here with a lot of elegant imagery... but I waited and waited for some real drama here or at least some hot lesbian chemistry, but everything is so subtle and these leads are so icy that the whole thing just felt a bit monotone. And yet the promise of something more interesting seems to exist, so I just couldn't turn it off. Despite its shortcomings, I still remained engaged, I suppose.

When the very hardworking Mlanie (Dborah Franois) is a child, she fails a highly anticipated piano test due to a thoughtless and insensitive judge. This is her undoing and she gives up her music entirely. Many years later, Mlanie is a young adult who takes an internship at a law firm. Her boss is the husband of the insensitive piano judge and Mlanie weasels her way into their family to take her revenge. She seems so diligent and responsible, but her presence is truly insidious and she slowly does her bits of evil on every family member.

She takes a special interest in Ariane (the piano judge), of course, a much older woman who's become vulnerable and unstable following a car accident. Mlanie becomes her official piano music page turner and someone Ariane can trust and rely upon. Mlanie also works at seducing her.

But everything is so subtle and slow-moving... not much seems to happen and this revenge plot just unwinds into a very unsatisfying ending. The whole time one is left wondering if she will even bother or if she has truly found some love or is too sweet or who knows what. It is a revenge story, but not a very juicy one. I also had a hard time buying into the initial premise that a judge would be that reckless and the child so focused on revenge. As for the lesbian bits... meh. Don't expect more than a kiss.

8189468,3,B000P6R9NK,"The film is a slowly-gathering-dread thriller.  The premise, that a child's bad experience at a judging of her pianistic abilities (and the thoughtless behavior of one judge) leads to her taking revenge, years later, on the same judge, to near-murderous effect, is ludicrous, of course.  The choice of chamber music is odd, and not satisfying at all.  It is revealed in the ancillary remarks that the director (some sort of musician) chose relatively unchallenging single movements by Shostakovich and Schubert so that the non-pianist actress would look authentic at the keyboard (she had had lessons in her youth).  It does not work, because the actress sits rather casually at the instrument, and has zero concentration.  (I think that she did not use her feet on the pedals at all.)  In fact, all the segments of music-performing are bland and unconvincing.  There is some entertainment value in the quirkiness of each of the characters, and it's nice to see the French countryside.",1407024000,3,985,5.080745341614906

8189472,5,B000P6R9NK,"Denis Dercourt both wrote (with Jacques Sotty) and directed this very low key but very devastating tale of concentrated revenge. It has a tight script, a cast of very fine actors, and a pacing that holds the audience to the story wondering how the 'plan' will work out in the end.

10-year-old Mlanie (Julie Richalet) is a gifted piano student, the daughter of a butcher and his wife, whose studies provide her with the opportunity to enter the academy if she is successful in winning an audition. At the audition the chief judge is the accomplished pianist Ariane Fouchcourt (Catherine Frot) who allows an autograph seeker to disrupt Mlanie's audition, a disruption that results in breaking Mlanie's concentration: she does not win the audition and moreover she gives up the piano altogether.  10 years later Mlanie (the very beautiful Dborah Franois) works as an intern in a wealthy lawyer's office - M. Fouchcourt (Pascal Greggory) - who happens to be married to Ariane, now with a terrible stage fright because of an accident.  When M. Fouchcourt needs a nanny to care for his young son Tristan (Antoine Martynciow), Mlanie ask for the job and moves to the mansion in the country where she tends after Tristan and admires Ariane's practicing. Ariane is preparing a concert in a trio with violinist and cellist  wife and husband (Christine Citti and Jacques Bonnaff).  Ariane fears the performance but finds security when Mlanie offers to turn pages for her.  A strong bond forms between the two, a bond that appears to go beyond music, and the concert results in success.  The manner in which Mlanie works her way into Ariane's need and her response to advances made by the married cellist begin to divulge the intention of Mlanie's involvement with the Fouchcourt family.  How she choreographs her revenge for her childhood disappointment is the direction the story takes to its end.

Aside from the obvious fact that this film is in many ways an intense psychological thriller, the other joys offered are some excerpts from the music of Shostakovich, Bach, and Schubert.  Each of the actors is superb and the manner in which director Dercourt leads us through this maze of belated revenge is truly fine filmmaking.

8189473,5,B000P6R9NK,"This French language film is about a revenge that is as cold as one could imagine short of some kind of physical violence.  Melanie, the 10-year-old precocious child of a butcher and his wife, is set for an audition that will determine whether she gets into a prestigious musical academy.  She is calm, cool, confident and very talented.  All goes well until about halfway through when one of the students comes in to get the autograph of one of the judges (Ariane Fourchecourt played by Catherine Frot).  Melanie is distracted and commits a finger-fault or two, and is not admitted.  She leaves in tears but not before slamming the keyboard cover down on the student's fingers.  Small revenge.

The backlighting as the opening credits roll emphasizes the butcher's trade: the cold, indifferent cutting of dead animal bodies.  This is contrasted with the fine art of classical music.  It is a beautiful setup for what is to come.  My congratulations to director Denis Dercourt who orchestrated this petite cinematic masterwork.  Everything is done with a minimum of explanation and certainly without any talking of the plot.  We see and draw conclusions.  The camera shows; the events reveal; and if we are astute we can guess what is to come.  Maybe.  But the plot plays out in unpredictable ways like a good thriller, and we are surprised by turns.

Some years pass and the preadolescent Melanie is now a young woman played by the bewitching Deborah Francois.  We know she is the same person as the younger Melanie played by Julie Richalet because she affects the same severe hair style and the same cold, almost unfeeling countenance.  By accident she goes to work as a nanny to a young boy whose mother is the very woman who signed the autograph and caused Melanie to misplay her piece.  She is concert pianist herself and the rich wife of a successful lawyer.  However she doesn't remember Melanie nor have any idea that her autograph-signing led to Melanie giving up playing the piano.

But enough of the plot.  It is the kind of story that is best viewed cold without foreknowledge.  Suffice it to say, big revenge to come.  In addition to the denotative storyline there is a kind of satire on male-female relationships as usually depicted in film, on the world of the wealthy versus that of the masses, on the power of status and station versus that of raw animal beauty.  As I watched Deborah Francois at work I kept thinking: she has the power even though Ariane has the money and the station.

Additionally there is a play on the idea of the smooth, nearly irresistible sociopath, usually in the form of a man on the make.  Here that role belongs to a woman.  What she does to Ariane is nonviolent, but we see in a couple of scenes just what sort of physical violence she is capable of.  I should note that some of the plot is a bit unlikely, including the fact of the interruption, which would not have been allowed during a serious audition.  Also the psychology of Ariane becoming nervous when she has to perform because of a traffic accident seems a bit off.  Furthermore the boy is not likely to get a sore arm from playing the piano at too fast a tempo.  Still these are quibbles when compared to the interesting psychology of the film.

Finally, I very much enjoyed Deborah Francois's performance and that of the other players.  Her beauty captured the camera and my eyes.  She intrigued and seemed entirely believable.  If I were director Denis Dercourt I would make a follow up to this in which she again acts out her psychopathic nature, but maybe this time she is not so successful.  However it would be hard to top the crisp, mesmerizing hour and 25 minutes of this film, one of the best psychological dramas I've seen in a while.

By the way, it is said that the popular expression, ""revenge is a dish best served cold"" really means not that the longer you wait to enact revenge the more you will enjoy it, but instead if you wait long enough you will realize the error of revenge and forgo it.  I believe this latter interpretation is correct and wise.

All mental. And unlike other reviewers who called it predictable, I disagree unless you just happened to 'correctly guess' the ending but the direction could have gone anyway. Until the end it was 50/50 if the main character Melanie would have a change of heart, esp because of the relationship with the young son. Nicely done.

8189475,1,B000P6R9NK,"As a musician, and having spent a lot of time around other musicians, I can tell anyone who cares to read on (spoilers ahead) that the premise of this movie is shaky at best.

First of all, no one interrupts auditions.  Not even the most arrogant star soloist would  bend this rule just for an autograph.  Second, if the budding pianist whose future was supposedly ruined by this had really wanted music all that badly, she'd have kept it up no matter what.  And the so-called accident with a cello is awfully  like the death of Lully.

But it also seems that the movie gives a mythical value to the role of the page turner that it doesn't really possess.  Yes, it's important to have a good page turner,  but the page turner is still low man on the music totem pole. And it wouldn't even be that hard to find a good one; all Ariane would have needed to do was ask for an advanced student from the nearest conservatory.  Even the poster shot for the movie is deceptive in this regard; the page turner, no matter how young and pretty, would never dress as strikingly as the performers, and would probably never be an occasion for discussions among members of an ensemble.

The following review of an inept violinist has had the names of several legends of the violin and the piano of the turn of the 20th century attached to it.  I personally remember it as involving Fritz Kreisler and Leopold Godowsky, but in the website on which I found it, it was assigned to Georges Enesco and Alfred Cortot  ""There was a strange concert at the Salle Gavreau last night,"" it read. ""The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played the piano. Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages. And the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.""",1276992000,5,1763,4.421052631578948
