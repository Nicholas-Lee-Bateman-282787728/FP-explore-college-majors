PATTI ROCKS: I was jammin this chick in LaCrosse, Billy (Mulkey) confesses to his old buddy Eddie (Jenkins), and I knocked her up. Hes in deep doodyespecially if his wife finds out. Billy talks the reluctant Eddie into riding down to LaCrosse with him to talk the chick into having an abortion. On their road trip they joke and drink and talk about sex and chicks and other gonadal stuff.

Patti Rocks (Landry), the beef Billy chopped, is none too happy to have the boys invade her place at midnight. Billy cant explain why he doesnt want her to keep the babybut thats why he brought Eddie. Patti turns out to be an unlikely lover for Billy: Shes savvy, insightful, sensitiveand has her act together. She and Eddie talk: about Billy, about men and women, about Eddies divorce, which wounded him deeply. And then things really take a turn for the weird...

Discussion: The slender premise serves as an excuse for the characters to engage in dialogs about love, sex, friendship, sex, divorce, sex, loneliness, sex and other vital topics, like sex. While slight on plot, the characters are key, and they define the tone of the film: half macho misogyny, half sensitive questioning.

Mulkeys Billy is some piece of work, and could best be described as any number of body parts, none of them above the waist. Hes a sleazy weasel, a low-class, potty-mouthed slob; hes dumb and angry; rude, crude and lewd; a jock and a jerk. And it takes the entire film to find out whether or not theres anything beneath his obnoxious bravado. Patti is a pleasant surprise: a strong, smart, adult woman completely comfortable in her sexuality. And poor Eddie is caught between the two worlds.

The emotions are naked and exposed; the dialog down and dirty. Its a raw, raucous, raunchy drama with a razor-sharp edge of angry comedy: original, edgy and unpredictable; a high class low budget film that relies on character and dialog and does not disappoint.",1422576000,3,2188,4.672727272727273
7809270,2,6301055721,"This movie's plot is not worth the time spent watching it.  Bad acting bad, bad plot, bad directing.  I bought it because a friend of mine, Doug Maynard, did the sound track and that's pretty good, but not his best.",1421107200,,215,4.35

7809272,4,6301055721,"This film was made long before ""alpha male"" and ""beta male"" became buzz phrases.  This came out a decade before ""In the Company of Men.""  Still, it's an interesting look at the dynamic between two men.  Men's studies scholars have said that men don't just compare themselves to women, but to other men as well.  Here, the dominant male brags of ""getting the girl"" but the weaker male rules the day.  It's not a religious work, but here ""the meek shall inherit the earth.""  It's a road trip picture; some would say it's a buddy film.  This may bore some, but I found it interesting.  There is male nudity here.  This is not a film for the underaged.  Still, this was an intriguing look at how American men saw themselves and other men in the late 1980s.",1109030400,14,752,4.423357664233577
