7918593,5,B00003ETQP,"It takes a lot for a movie to make me laugh out loud. TAMPOPO is one of those films. It's so fresh and original that just describing the ""plot"" doesn't give you a sense of what the movie is really about. What little story there is involves two truck drivers who help a single mother create the perfect noodle. Sounds really interesting, right?
A more useful description would be that TAMPOPO presents a series of vignettes involving three subjects: sex, food and the movies.
One of the funniest scenes in the movie involves an elderly man ordering his favorite food at a restaurant. The humor builds in such a way that by the end of the scene, your sides will be hurting from laughing so hard.
Still not convinced? Trust me, this is a great film. Mere words can not do it justice.
THE FUNERAL is a darkly comic take on the whole experience surrounding the death of the family patriarch. A TAKING WOMAN follows the adventures of a freckled tax collector that takes a different comedic approach. The latter was followed by the sequel A TAXING WOMAN RETURNS, which is also very funny.
Sure, you could buy all of these three films separately, but since all of them are very good (if not great), why not go for the package deal? If you're tired of formulaic comedies that are predictable, this collection is for you.",1015545600,4,1311,4.559322033898305
