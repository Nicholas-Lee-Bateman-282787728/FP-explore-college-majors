5272383,5,B00962R0EW,"Diehard Mannix fans will be standing in line to buy this release.

Mannix ran for 8 years and 194 episodes.  Only 130 were syndicated in the U.S. after the show went off the air in 1975.  The remaining 64 episodes comprised all of Season 1, most of Season 7, and all of Season 8. Now that Seasons 1 and 7 have both been released on DVD, this release will close the loop on all the ""missing"" episodes that Mannix fans have been talking about and hoping for over the past 37 years.  And since the quality of the first seven releases were superlative and uncut, this edition should prove to be a real treat, too.

5272388,5,B00962R0EW,"What can I say?  It's Mannix.  I always liked Mike Connors's portrayal of Mannix.  Not the heartless all-brain type, nor the slovenly type, nor the OCD type, nor the late 60s ""gotta have a handicapped detective"" type (Longstreet, Ironsides, Jones, etc.).  Just an all around every day type of guy who has learned how to be a detective and is pretty good at it, although he makes mistakes.  (You wonder if he'll ever learn not to walk up to the bad guy too closely when holding a gun on him.  For pete's sake, make him lean against the wall, etc.  Don't wait for him to surprise you.)  But apart from the annoyance, he does get the job done without having to be a hard case.  I like the way that he has compassion on other folks, even ones that didn't hire him, but whom he bumps into and wants to help.",1456358400,,802,4.258278145695364

A Mannix fan since October '67, I had never seen the final seasons' episodes. I knew there were changes- the Camaro hero car for one- and I knew the series was getting a little long in tooth. Having seem most of the discs I know I needn't've worried.
A few observations:
*Some of the episodes seem to ne 'inspired' by earlier ones but after 160+ shows what series wouldn't be?
*Ol' Joe is still getting whacked on the head A LOT. The final whack was delivered by a young John Ritter, trying his hand at villainry. His bottle connected and Connors really did go to his knees from the assault. Time to retire. Ritter was wise to go to comedy.
*The production quality was excellent! There is one continuity problem with a car in an early episode, but the rest was flawless.
*Gotta love the sport coats! A friend owns the '68 Dart used in the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show (google MANNIX DART GTS/C Van Tune) and took it to Mike Connors' home, Connors gave him one of the jackets... he has dozens from the show. Perfect for the era... Loud was in!
*The direction of the episodes was excellent! I'm especially fond of the Bill Bixby ep 'The Empty Tower'... maybe a liiiiittle predictable but still fun.
* Mike Connors ,ay have been a little tired by year 8 but his [performances were solid and dammit, you LIKE the guy! Too bad there wasn't a fitting revival of the show in TV Movies like happened with ROckford and Columbo. Intried... I wrote one with a friend in the '90s that woulda been good!
* Mannix was always a good primer on the Los Angeles landscape- excellent visuals especially toward the final episodes. Hollywood was different then!
* Buy the set, buy the whole series! Show Joe the proper respect!
AND...Happy 90th Birthday Mike Connors 8-25-2015!",1446422400,,1778,4.524844720496894

5272409,5,B00962R0EW,"The MANNIX series reached its perfection in its final season (1974-1975).  However, some here have mentioned that these final episodes somehow did not match the quality of the earlier seasons.  I did not get that impression at all.  In fact, I found it to be quite the opposite.  The final episodes seem more modern, of course, and therefore easier to relate to.  When I actually saw MANNIX on prime-time T.V. when it was still in production, I was just a kid and it was the '74-'75 season.  Since then, I've seen three of the earlier seasons in their entirety on DVD and a few other earlier episodes on cable T.V.  Season Eight features Mannix at his best in episodes which will keep you glued to the screen.  From what I've seen, if I had to recommend just one season of MANNIX it would be this season.",1376352000,,804,4.458904109589041
5272410,5,B00962R0EW,"I am 56 don't know if it is my age or what but TV today is trash, women sleeping with women, men sleeping with men ,women portrayed as whores and shows of kids disrespecting their parents and let's not forget the trash reality shows and news you cannot trust. If I was young and wanted kids I would have to think twice now because no matter how hard you try to raise your kids up right it would be so in possible with all the crap on TV, radio and our sorry ass education system teaching our kids to hate this country. Kids today don't want toys or ride bicycles they want tattoo's and got their hands out wanting something with out working for it. Mannix and many other TV shows back in the 50's, 60,s' and some 70's are so much better then the trash on TV today and Mannix was one of the best it's so good I have bought  ALL EIGHT YEARS.I give this show 5 stars now don't get me wrong we had problems in this country in the 60's 70's during my young years but compared today and I tell kids if they could go back during that time for one year they would stay in that time zone.",1375660800,,1079,4.042056074766355

Get all of Mannix. You will be glad you did.",1375056000,7,225,3.52
5272412,4,B00962R0EW,"I'm not sad that the 8th season is the last for Mannix. Hell, the guy has taken 40 to 50 bullet-wounds, been clubbed over the
head at least 100 times, almost died 4 times, & jumped off enough houses to cause ankle & knee-trauma in any man over 21.

Many of the best episodes in this season are on the first 3 disks. Learning from the 7th season, the producers have Joe go to San Francisco, Palm Springs, the Sierras & Albuquerque to break up the (by-this-point) very familiar LA/Bel Air/Griffith Park/Hollywood Hills locations. (Not to mention over-use of the same studio sets used by Mission Impossible, Star Trek & other shows)

The episode with Larry Storch as the manager of a horrendously-bad folk duo made me laugh until I wanted to cry. Another highlight was the mental deterioration of a criminal who kidnaps Peggy. His downward spiral into madness is frightening, & must have been strong stuff for TV audiences of the time. The Albuquerque episode is excellent. Using Tent Rocks as a showdown spot was brilliant. And like in Season 7, the San Fran episode is a thing of scenic beauty. On the downside, the Bill Bixby episode is slow & predictable. If you don't see the twist coming, you haven't been watching previous seasons. They also overdo the crazy old army buddies from Korea bit. You would think Joe Mannix served in a platoon full of psychos !!

Fashion Notes: I find it sad that due to the mid-1970's dictates, Joe Mannix is often seen wearing a white (or powder blue) shirt/jacket with huge flat collars & epaulets that button at the shoulders. It is SO ""Love Boat"". Compare this to the cool brown suede jacket & dark sports-coats he wore in the first 4 seasons, and you know it's not a change for the better.

It's fantastic to have series like Mannix w/ 200 episodes, or Perry Mason w/ 270 episodes. These mini-movies will provide entertainment for our whole lives.",1374796800,4,1886,4.637724550898204

5272421,5,B00962R0EW,"This is the final round for Mannix and many of these episodes I have never seen or have not seen since their original CBS-TV airing. One of the best PI Shows on tv especially with Mike Connors. A must have set.  There is only one more Mannix episode to find: Mike Connors guest-starred on one DIAGNOSIS: MURDER episode with Dick Van Dyke and he played Joe Mannix in this episode, and Dick Van Dyke of course was his Doctor trying to keep Joe well- as Joe is working on a case. Good episode but you will have to find that one on a  Diagnosis Murder DVD Set.  Enjoy this final season of Mannix which has many great episodes and tremendous guest stars.  ****FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY WHICH MAY BE OF INTEREST:  Way back in the past,there were some film credits where Mr. Connors was cast as ""TOUCH CONNORS""  and later his name was changed to Mike Connors.  ***And before the long-running MANNIX series, Mike Connors starred in another TV series: It was called ""TIGHTROPE"" and it ran on TV from 1959 to 1960 for 37 hour-long episodes for only one season on CBS. I don't know if the shows were in color or black & white-I think they were in B&W. The character he played was Agent Nick Stone. I don't think any episodes are available at this time. I don't know if Mike Connors was a P.I.,an officer, or a spy in this series. All I do remember is that he carried his gun in a belt holster in the middle of his back. It would be interesting to see ""TIGHTROPE"" released to see if the two characters he played are similar to each other or not.

5272423,5,B00962R0EW,I remember watching this show during my childhood.  I love Mike Connors and Gail Fisher!  Great guest stars!! Best detective show on TV!,1358812800,,136,4.869565217391305
5272424,5,B00962R0EW,"I have purchased and watched all 8 seasons of Mannix DVDs, most of which I watched when it was first aired.  For those who are unfamiliar with this fantastic series, you might wonder should you start with the first season or the last?  Although Season 1 offers the added bonus of an interview with Mike Connors, I believe the show really hit its stride about two-thirds of the way through its run.  By that point Mike Connors and Gail Fisher, his costar and African-American secretary, had developed a genuine rapport.  Throughout all 8 seasons Mike Connors remained a credible action hero since he has the athletic ability to carry off the running, jumping, climbing, fighting, and skiing that his role required.  The series is noteworthy among crime shows in that it consistently had a respectful treatment of blacks, Mexican immigrants, and Mannix's Armenian heritage.  While the final episode in Season 8 does not end with a grand finale, it did carry on the show's consistent high quality with direction by Bill Bixby and guest stars William Windom, John Ritter, and James Hampton.",1358553600,13,1086,4.93956043956044
5272435,5,B00962R0EW,"Same great quality as seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. I only watched a few episodes from 8, thus far. I want to watch them in order. Great series!!",1358294400,,138,3.4838709677419355
5272436,5,B00962R0EW,I am a Mannix fan so I have the whole collection. When I was young it was my favorite TV show. So glad CBS decided to release in on DVD.,1358035200,,136,3.566666666666667
5272437,5,B00962R0EW,"I own the entire Mannix series.  It is in my opinion one of the best tv programs of that era.  There is absolutely nothing disappointing about Mannix from season one to the final season.  If you enjoyed watching this show back in the late sixties and seventies for the first time, then this is a must have.",1358035200,2,306,4.333333333333333

5272440,5,B00962R0EW,"It is hard to imagine that when ""Mannix"" was brought to syndication in the late 1970s, the first and final seasons were never shown for reasons unknown.  But this classic detective series gets the greatest sendoff with final season and I was happy.  I never saw this final season until I got this DVD and I was not disappointed.  Mannix is by far, one of the greatest detective shows of all time!",1356998400,5,396,4.472222222222222
5272441,3,B00962R0EW,"I am watching the last season now.  I have enjoyed the seasons before this and couldn't wait for more.  But now I have 2 more discs to go.  But so far I think that this season was off somehow.  Either the enthusiasm of the actors was gone, or the writers were different, something that I can't put my finger on.  After I watch the last two discs I might change my mind.",1356998400,2,369,4.069444444444445
5272442,5,B00962R0EW,"By far, Mannix was one of the best tv shows of the 20th century. For those that liked well written action and adventure this was your show. The chemistry between Connors and Fisher was incredible, the perfect pairing. Too bad this show only ran 8 seasons. I have seen a lot stupider shows last a lot longer. At least thankfully, they are not thinking of a remake like the stupid new Hawaii Five-O. Some things are better left untouched and this show is one. At least now I can enjoy every season and episode at my leisure. Perfect way to spend a Sunday night I think !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1355961600,2,583,4.457943925233645
5272443,5,B00962R0EW,My husband and I are such great fans of Mannix we have every season and hate to see it end.  I guess we will have to just start all over with season one.  The sound and picture quality is excellent.,1355875200,,198,3.925
5272444,5,B00962R0EW,"As I write this review I'm in the middle of watching the episode ""Hardball"" which not only is the final episode of the season, but puts a seal on the entire series as well. This is it-unless you count ""Hard boiled murder"" but that's really part of the ""Diagnosis Murder"" series. At the end of every review for this show I used to request Paramount to release the next season--regrettably this time that's not possible, unless, of course, in a rather very unlikely event we can convince a now 87-year-old Mike Connors to revive the show for a 9th season (don't count on that!)this is it. John Ritter makes a guest appearance in this last episode. Most of the action takes place at a court house w/ several folks held hostage,a wounded Art Malcom among them. Gail Fisher is not in this one, in fact no scenes at 17 Paseo Verde either. Other familiar faces are guests here. Rue Maclanahan plays the mother of a kidnapped daughter in ""Game Plan"". Pamela Franklin plays the victim of a hit & run, coming out of a coma in ""A Fine Day For Dying"". In ""Portrait of the Blues"" Larry Storch (remember him from F-Troop)plays a crooked manager for a folk duo. In ""Green Men"" Mannix searches for a counterfeiter  & Russell Johnson plays one of the hoods in this one. Oh, & here's a nasty one! ""A Word Called Courage"" & another one of Mannix's fellow Korean War vets is at it again--this time locking him up & torturing him. Some of those guys who served in Korea with Joe are exactly the reason vets need to be treated for PTSD. Bill Bixby appears in the ""Empty Tower"". Another cool one is the 2-part ""Bird Of Prey"" where Mannix is is in South America & almost framed for a presidential assassination. That episode by the way was based on a Victor Canning novel ""Birds Of Prey"". And just only moments ago I finished watching season 8 & guess what-I put season 1 back in (Intertect) showing the 1st episode ""The Name Is Mannix"" with a somewhat younger looking Mike Connors-that's right I'm starting to watch the series all over again. Few episodes from season 8 I ever saw before but most I've never seen until now, as everything from the first 7 seasons I've seen multiple times. Now I sure hope Paramount moves on to releasing later seasons of ""Cannon"" & ""Barnaby Jones"".",1355097600,3,2258,4.4939172749391725
