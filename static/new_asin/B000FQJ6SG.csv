8608280,4,B000FQJ6SG,"My son was right at the upper end of the age spectrum for this DVD (11mo when we bought it). He really enjoys the songs and finger plays...but he enjoys anything if mom is paying attention to him! This is not a sit and watch DVD...you follow along with what the video is doing so you are interacting with your baby. I couldn't sing Itsy Bitsy Spinder one more time, so this DVD really helped my come up with some new ideas to play with my son. It feels a bit amateurish and cheaply produced, but again...he doesn't care :-)",1172275200,2,523,4.24
