8169566,3,B000063CJV,"I grew up watching Asian movies and this is one
I actually remember seeing on the big screen.
'Big screen' would've been a good idea for the
DVD, as the full screen cropping here renders
much of the already incomprehensible action in
this film even more so. It's a kind of a shame
really, as this is one of the few benchmarks in
the early Hong Kong career of martial arts star
Bolo Yeung, who started out as Yang Sze for the
Shaw Bros. and who here makes what I believe is
his only venture behind the camera as co-author,
producer, fight choreographer, and director - as
well as playing one of the two leads. The plot is
akin to a western, as two shiftless no-accounts
are taken out of jail and forced to become the
'law and order' of a small corrupt town, with
comic results - and some decent fight scenes.
Yang Sze adopted the 'Bolo' name after his most
famous character, the back-breaking bodyguard he
played in Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon'.",1287705600,,946,4.411428571428571

8169568,5,B000063CJV,This is an action - comedy not to be missed! A lost classic. You'll bust a gut when he thanks Jesus for his kung-fu. There's even a crossdressing hooker that attacks him with chicken style kung-fu... of course my fav is american hot dog style...,1105920000,5,245,4.466666666666667
8169569,5,B000063CJV,The movie rocks!  One of the greatest old-style Kung-Fu films ever made.  The plot is typical of this genre of film; not much needed when the fighting rocks!,1025654400,2,157,4.571428571428571
