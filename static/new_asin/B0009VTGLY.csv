8067636,1,B0009VTGLY,"These two Tex Ritter films are being sold for one dollar by retail chain stores in a cardboard sleeve without shrinkwrap. They can be identified by the ""Treasure Box"" logo on the bottom, left corner of the sleeve backside.

These films would be great entertainment if the source material was good. Trouble in Texas is better than Arizona Days which looks like it was taken from a VHS copy. Arizona Days is fuzzy and there are missing frames plus occassional out-of-sync audio. Trouble in Texas is sharper focus and appears to be from a 16mm print.

While you can purchase this disc for $1.00 at Walgreen's and other chain stores, it is only worth buying if you want to watch Trouble in Texas. My low rating is not a reflection of the films but this release of such.",1153958400,2,765,4.536231884057971
8067637,1,B0009VTGLY,"I picked this one up at the Dollar Store and it was still overpriced. These Tex Ritter Grand National B westerns are about average for poverty row oaters but ""Arizona Days"" is missing the middle 15 minutes or so (probably one complete 35mm reel). There is an abrupt cut 20 minutes into the film that makes you say ""Huh?"". Running time is 42 minutes instead of claimed 57 minutes on packaging. The print is also horribly out of focus and splicy and looks like it was sourced from a VHS tape at EP speed. Maybe it's best those 15 minutes are missing. I don't know if my eyes could have taken 57 minutes of such poor quality video! ""Trouble in Texas"" is complete at 63 minutes and the print is barely passable. Young, beautiful Rita Hayworth (billed as Rita Cansino) is the highlight of this one. Lots of stock rodeo footage pads what little plot there is. Don't expect very much...and you'll probably still be disappointed!",1119312000,8,921,4.554216867469879
