There is potential here. The story has enough interest that it could have been a half way decent film. It has a similar story line as ""the final girl"". Unfortunately, stilted speech and unfortunate acting just make this film so boring. Most of the cast sound like they are still learning to speak english and are so focused on pronounciation, that they lose the ability to emote. The script sounds like it is the work of an amateur writer. This movie is a plot wasted. The filming isn't awful. It's just not good. With some changes to the cast and script, this movie could have been a really interesting action/horror movie.
Although, the ending is just stupid.",1465516800,2,728,4.564885496183206
