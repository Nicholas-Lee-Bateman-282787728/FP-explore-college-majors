8747551,3,B001DDBD2C,"These are all fairly old (50's) movies and are not remastered in any way. So, my expectations were limited to being able to view them from start to finish.
Unfortunately, the Submarine X-1 movie froze in several places throughout the DVD.
The movies were labeled (used), but I would at least expect playable.
All in All, still a very good buy. The movies: Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep are excellent adventures.",1357084800,,418,4.739726027397261
