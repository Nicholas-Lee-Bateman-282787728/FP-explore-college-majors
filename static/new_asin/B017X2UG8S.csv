7536348,5,B017X2UG8S,"As a more recent discoverer of the cultural importance of the NY Worlds Fair, ""After the Fair..."" just increased our appetite in learning more. The impact on Disney theme parks (especially Epcot) was my original reason for exploring, but discovering that Jim Henson, Sid and Marty Kroft, and the Beatles had a part in the story and that a relocated pavilion was a part of my childhood (the Parker Pen Pavilion relocated to the Lodge of the Four Seasons in Missouri) just whetted my appetite for more information. The video reports the stories with spectacular videos of the attractions, but I wish there was more done to consider the impact of this microcosm of modern corporate America juxtaposed to international relationships. What a good college class that would be! The video was so engaging it caused my wife and I to make the visit to Queens this last year just to visit Flushing Meadows to witness the triumph and tragedy of this urban history. I value this DVD in my collection of Disney/Cultural History.",1452038400,,1014,4.833333333333333
7536349,5,B017X2UG8S,"Full of information about where some 64-65 NY World's Fair remnants ended up, perfect for planning road trips to visit these items/places, so that it is almost like the fair isn't over!",1447891200,,185,4.8125
7536350,5,B017X2UG8S,Very interesting video about my favorite place in Queens.  I was 7 years old when the fair first came to Queens.  Unfortunately I was too young to remember very much of it but I do remember my favorite pavilions.  This video is great in that it shows clips from the fair and what happened to many of the pavilions that had been dismantled and moved to other locations.  It makes me want to take a road trip and find my Sinclair dinosaurs and the other remnants.  I highly recommend this video not only for people who went to the fair but for the people who spend time in Flushing Meadows and who don't have any idea of the history of the place.,1447718400,,644,4.245901639344262

This movie has great footage and great interviews from the people that built the Fair as well as people that were there. It focuses in the end on what happened to many of the Pavilions after the fair ended. Very entertaining!,1536537600,,321,4.193548387096774
8740921,5,B017X2UG8S,"Great memories!  People who enjoy theme parks today should realize the 1964-65 World's Fair in NYC was the precursor.  In fact, Walt Disney took some of the rides down to Florida when he created his park.  Great bit of history.",1513209600,,227,4.625
