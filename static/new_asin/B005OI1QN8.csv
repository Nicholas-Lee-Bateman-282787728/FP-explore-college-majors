4852330,5,B005OI1QN8,"Usually I do not see the new seasonal movies that air on Hallmark channel (or any ""cable"" network) until the following year when - and if they release to DVD. This year, this film was released in the U.K. and Canada, and was one I really wanted to see, it was my one ""guilty pleasure"" buy. Turns out I was really pleased at the results...

""A Princess for Christmas"" (the American/Hallmark Channel title but A.K.A., ""A Christmas Princess"" or ""Christmas at Castlebury Hall"") revolves around a woman (Katie McGrath) who takes her niece and nephew to visit their British grandfather who just happens to be a duke. During their stay, Jules learns to let go of the past and forgive the man who rejected his son for marrying a commoner and there is, of course, a fairy-tale ending. The acting in this one was actually nothing to scoff at - Katie held her own against veteran Roger Moore (part of the James Bond fame) although as an Irish actress, there were occasions where ever the slightest hint of her accent slipped into her American dialogue. Still, she was great, plus she and Sam were really cute together. If there are any really faults or clichs, it is in the script which can sometimes take its talent for granted. Nevertheless this is a wonderful little family film - all warm and fuzzy as it finds just the right moods of festiveness, and yet, captures a real emphasis on family and its importance. ""Christmas at Castlebury Hall"" (which is what it released under in Canada), this film is available in Katie's home land and will likely appear on DVD here, in America fall 2012 (if tradition dictates). If you didn't catch it on Hallmark, watch for repeat showings or the DVD, because it is a sweet princess story.

O.K., it's confession time: I absolutely adored this movie. For practical reasons, I can't say it was because this is a sweeping epic based off a true story or because it has a beautiful spiritual bent, but because there is a fairy-tale quality that I couldn't help but love. To be honest, the movie starts out a bit rocky but... I thought the ending was adorable and I liked how the characters interacted - including the servants with Jules and the kids. In that way, this movie actually reminded me (albeit very loosely) of ""Downton Abbey."" This is definitely one of my most loved Christmas films from 2011 - I am so glad I was able to see it; A Princess for Christmas is just another charming `hallmark' of why this channel is oh-so-popular.",1325030400,13,2464,4.597727272727273
8481275,5,B005OI1QN8,"Anything with Roger Moore in it has to be good!  I haven't watched it because it's off-season, so I will wait til the Christmas season arrives. It also features Sam Heughan as Mr. Moore's son.  I am a fan of Sam Heughan, and collect any DVDs in which he appears.",1524182400,,262,4.22

8481282,5,B005OI1QN8,I have this on DVD but when I found that it was also available on BLU-RAY I jumped at the chance of ordering. I'm glad I did because it is GREAT improvement. The picture is brighter and the sound is out of this world. This movie is truly a classic. I was surprised to find that the default language is ENGLISH although there are many other languages available on the disc.,1461628800,2,372,4.253521126760563
