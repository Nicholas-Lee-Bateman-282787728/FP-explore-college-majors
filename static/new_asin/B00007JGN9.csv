7976713,5,B00007JGN9,"The story of ""The King's Beard"" revolves around three protagonists: an idealistic and ambitious young man, a brave and kind fairy, and a noble but cursed king.  The King's brother, who was envious of the thrown, cursed the King with an amazingly large beard that grew to cover the King's entire city.  The townspeople have learned to live with the beard, but it has immobilized the king and prevents him from leaving his throne room.

The King's brother used a fairy's wand to complete the curse, but the wand is now out of magical power.  He sends him minions to steal another wand from another fairy.

The young man is an outsider who has purchased the only barbershop in the King's kingdom.  It is only when he arrives in town that he realizes that no one in the kingdom actually cuts their hair or shaves out of sympathy (and emulation) of the King.

The paths of these three characters cross through a sequence of accidents, and they unite to defeat the evil brother.

The story sounds both bizarre and clich?, but it works extremely well. The story is pleasantly unpredictable and fast paced while still being appropriate for small children. There are several musical numbers that are fun, and the voice acting is very good.  The story is a morality tale that emphasizes bravery, loyalty, a healthy skepticism along with idealist notions, individual hard work, and team work.  It was ideal for my 4 year old son, and was fun for me too.

I highly recommend this video for young children and families.  You will be pleasantly surprised.",1145318400,,1541,4.708955223880597
