3792485,4,B001TNGOXE,"Heavy attracted to a classmate Steve, Christian had been placed in a modern UK madhouse after killing a Steve's girlfriend in a school toilet.

In a couple of years, a female journalist's visit triggered a tragedian line of psycho-murders to fulfil Blake's desire to commit suicide before Steve's eyes.

I would not be interested in this British film if I knew a plot in advance, also performance is really nice.",1244851200,2,412,4.871428571428571
8342114,1,B001TNGOXE,"Under the care of a suspicious doctor, Christian Blake (writer/director Eoin Macken), confined in a mental institution has to deal with the repercussions of his actions taken with his ex-best friend Steve whom he feels betrayed him. We also learn more of the story within flashbacks.

This low budget film started off badly and just rapidly degenerated right before me eyes. The first part of the film is bad but passable (barely) but once the film comes back from the flashback it's mind-blowingly awful. Macken's poor POOR mans' Hannibal Lecter-esquire Christian, illogical plot, & horrid direction all combine into a putrid concoction that is hard to sit through.",1516406400,,666,5.166666666666667
8342115,2,B001TNGOXE,"I kept watching, because they seemed to be leading up to some sort of reveal that would make everything come clear. But there was nothing but vague plot points and a lot of running and fighting. While it did have an ending of sorts, it was not satisfying at all. I give one extra star for the nice music - and some of the running and fighting was entertaining. Otherwise don't waste your time.",1451952000,,393,4.324324324324325
8342116,1,B001TNGOXE,"I was very confused about the plot; no idea what the point of this was.
could only watch about 15 minutes of this........it's really boring and convoluted.",1441929600,,155,4.777777777777778

8342118,1,B001TNGOXE,"I had a really hard time getting into the plot of the movie. I got bored and turned it off. It needed to entice the viewer more, so that they can't leave the television until they have figured out the whole movie",1389830400,,212,4.071428571428571
8342119,1,B001TNGOXE,"Didn't like it.  Just could not get into it, sorry to say that but I watched until it was painful",1378166400,,97,3.85
8342120,1,B001TNGOXE,Christian Blake was an incredibly boring movie. They give no time for character development. There is barely even a plot. It was a complete waste of time.,1377475200,,154,4.7407407407407405
8342121,4,B001TNGOXE,"The acting was very good and the story,very believable.when I see a movie like this I can't wait until someone else watches it so we can talk about it together.",1376006400,2,160,4.366666666666666
8342122,3,B001TNGOXE,This is an okay movie. The movie was poorly made but it did have an unexpected interesting twist. I've seen worse.,1372118400,2,114,4.476190476190476
8342123,4,B001TNGOXE,"The movie is a great watch if you enjoy good cinematography and chemistry amoungst the actors. The plot is intresting enough and has a few good twist. Though it is a suspense or intelectual thriller i found alot of it to be hillarious at times.

Although its no Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg it does show amazing talent.",1364860800,,324,4.586206896551724
