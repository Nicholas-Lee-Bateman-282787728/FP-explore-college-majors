7602941,1,B01AIXA0EE,"WHO on God's green earth greenlit this project? Because THAT guy owes me the 99 cents I wasted on this drek. This waste of time nonsense makes an As Seen on TV infomercial seem like an Academy Award-winning blockbuster. ""Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!"" makes more sense than this drivel does.
I'm not sure even getting wasted before watching it would make it tolerable.
Consider yourselves warned. Now I'm off to do something more fun...like getting a root canal sans novocaine.",1468454400,,472,4.839506172839506
7602942,4,B01AIXA0EE,"This movie is a good, ""car broke down and friendly small town mechanic invites you to stay at his mother's house,"" movie.  There aren't really a lot of surprises, but the good old gags are very well done with a few new ideas thrown in.  I rated a four star because the movie was fun and had good timing on the jumps and scares.  It was well filmed and professionally produced.",1468368000,,376,4.267605633802817

7602944,1,B01AIXA0EE,"This movie would have to get better to be put on the bad list. If you pay more than $1.00 for this movie, you have paid too much",1464480000,,128,3.607142857142857
7602945,4,B01AIXA0EE,Surprisingly good for a lower budget teen screen flick.,1463356800,,55,5.222222222222222
7602946,5,B01AIXA0EE,Excellent movie really enjoyed,1462924800,,30,6.75
7602947,5,B01AIXA0EE,"I bought this movie solely because JOHN SCHNEIDER was appearing in it. The movie was filmed at John Schneider Studios in Holden, LA. Having been there, I recognized so many of the scenes in and round the houses and out buildings. The beautiful Louisiana picturesque grounds are featured during many of the outdoor scenes. The plot of spring breakers getting off at the wrong exit sets the movie for horror fans. Tom Sizemore is the creepy gas station attendant who befriends the kids, then takes advantage of his position to kill them off. Low-budget movie but well done for a film without heavy CGI and special effects. Abrupt ending could be set up for a sequel. Fun for a drive-in date.",1461715200,3,689,4.702479338842975
7602948,1,B01AIXA0EE,HORRIBLE CHEAPLY MADE MOVIE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.,1461283200,4,51,5.5
7602949,2,B01AIXA0EE,"This movie took way too long to get off the ground and ended poorly; clearly for the the 18-34 crowd, not my cup of tea, sorry!",1461283200,,127,3.923076923076923
7602950,5,B01AIXA0EE,It was scary,1461283200,,12,3.3333333333333335
7602951,1,B01AIXA0EE,"WOW...WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?!?
Okay first the sound... I could BARELY hear in some arts! I had to put in my headphones and turn it up almost all the way.
There was BARLEY any blood! If you are shooting a horror movie you need that and this movie totally lacked it! The actors playing the parts sounded almost bored, like they know the movie sucks and they could do WAY better. It doesn't really help that the only good one is a girl with a big rack.
I wasn't impressed at all...then i saw the ending and groaned... REALLY? I MEAN REALLY?!? The guys DAD comes in tries to find him!",1460937600,2,580,4.1875
7602952,1,B01AIXA0EE,"Tom Sizemore was the only good thing about this movie, but he's only in a few scenes!",1460246400,,85,4.0588235294117645
7602953,3,B01AIXA0EE,"This movie was entertaing and had it's good points.  It is not the best movie out there but with Amazon I have learned you have to seriosly lower your standards or it will be about impossible to find anything to watch.  The one really intolerable part of this movie is they loved showing them going to the bathroom.  It starts with one guy taking a dump ""seriously we can all do with not hearing and seeing that.""  After that it seemed to take turns that each of the coeds got to have a turn being filmed sitting on the toilet.  Why would they think anyone would want to see a whole bunch of that.  It probably should be given no more than 2 stars for that alone.",1460246400,3,663,4.181102362204724
7602954,1,B01AIXA0EE,I don't rate movies however I am for this one as the 3 stars fooled me and I am hoping mine will bring the rating down. Very bad! I agree with all the negative reviews,1460160000,5,167,3.8
7602955,1,B01AIXA0EE,Sound quality was horrible as was picture quality.,1460160000,,50,5.375
7602956,1,B01AIXA0EE,very bad. so amateurishly shot and edited that you feel sorry for the few decent actors in it trying so hard.,1460160000,2,109,4.238095238095238
7602957,2,B01AIXA0EE,"Two college couples are headed to Panama City for Spring Break. They get lost and have vehicle trouble, forced to spend the night at the hospitality of Roy (Tom Sizemore) a nice man who knows how to fix cars, but knows nothing about plumbing. To create some drama, two of the people who aren't couples had a one night stand, and Faith (Ashton Leigh) wants to confess to Laurie (Laura Flannery) she scored with her boyfriend Mick (Jamie Nocher). Roy tells them a story about the resurrected dead etc. etc. and keep the mirrors covered...which they did so it never played into the film in a clever way. In fact nothing really played into the film in a clever way. Oh wait that necklace thing, maybe.

The film was boring, the dialogue was rough, and the female actresses were apparently couch cast. What made the film worse than what it seemed was the awful soundtrack. What was that stuff? Riffs from an old ""Planet of the Apes"" film? And who the heck decides to name themselves ""Elvis & Nixon'? What a sad cry for attention.

Guide: F-word. Brief sex, Almost a frame of side-breast. Kids puking and taking a dump.  1 1/2 stars.",1459987200,4,1127,4.541871921182266

7602960,5,B01AIXA0EE,"I saw the trailer for this movie and it looks very intriguing.  Several promising up and coming performers are in it plus Tom Sizemore, and he is great.  So I pre-ordered the DVD.",1454198400,,179,4.393939393939394
8747513,1,B01AIXA0EE,"They couldn't have done a worse job if they tried... reminded me of ""All The Boys Love Mandy Lane."" Real waste of two good actors, Tom Sizemore and John Schneider.",1516147200,,163,4.466666666666667

8747519,4,B01AIXA0EE,"Not bad.  I watched it because John Schneider (from Dukes of Hazzard fame) produced it and he is even in it a little.  There were some unanswered questions for me and the ending kinda sucked but still, all in all I like it.  Good story line, good acting, so thus the 4 star rating.  :)",1473811200,,285,4.127272727272727
