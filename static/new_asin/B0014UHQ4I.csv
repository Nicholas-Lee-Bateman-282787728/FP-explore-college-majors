8256340,4,B0014UHQ4I,"The always controversial and incomparable Eloy de la Iglesia, once again delivered. In ""El diputado"" (AKA ""Confessions of a Congressman"" from 1978), we have a frank and honest portrayal of a closeted-gay Socialist politician during the post-Franco era in 70's Spain. The film may be a bit dated by today's standards, but it offered a realistic picture of what things were like during those turbulent times in Spain. The lead actor Jose Sacristan 'Orbea' was very good and believable, as the idealistic lawyer turned politician fighting for ""liberty and justice"". So was Agustin Gonzalez 'Carres', as the leader of the paramilitary right-wing group that recruited the street-kids that compromised and tried to blackmail 'Orbea'. The young actors were very good too (probably non-professional), as was Maria Luisa San Jose as 'Orbea's' understanding and supportive wife---'Carmen'. The sex-scenes were somewhat graphic and suggestive (probably done for a little shock-value too), which when considering the political climate in Spain during those days (the film was released in 1978), was nothing short of revolutionary. Especially when you consider the slip back into a form of ""puritanism"", in today's films. Eloy de la Iglesia never enjoyed real commercial success, which was a credit to his artistic integrity. Although his films were far from technical masterpieces, they stood out for their vivid portrayals of the marginalized classes and in stripping-off the veneer of hypocrisy on the Spanish Establishment. The quality of the film, though not restored for this DVD release is still very good and the English subtitles were adequate. Eloy de la Iglesia has left an indelible void and his contribution to Spanish and World Cinema is unquestionable. His films should be examined in a new light and given a full complete restoration and release too.

Love and Peace,

8256341,4,B0014UHQ4I,"If you're familiar with Eloy De La Iglesia's film work then you'd know that he's a hit or miss. I believe El Diputado is a hit despite feeling at times the movie to be a bit outdated for the current climate. The story itself doesn't really stand the test of time. But since the movie was well done, it can be appreciated by those who would remember that this movie was made in the early 80's.
It's a simple blackmailing story about an important figure with a ""dark"" secret who is active in a controversial political party. If that secret is exposed then he can kiss his political career goodbye. Interesting enough, now that I think about it, it's something that can still happen nowadays. But the reaction overall I believe wouldn't be so negative as it would've been back in the time period the film takes place in.
I have yet to see other films from Eloy De La Iglesia. But I'll definitely say that this is one of his best!",1236729600,3,926,4.3895348837209305
