Marquez,Miguel Cotto,and Ricardo Mayorga. Very entertaining from Start to finish. Manny Pacquiao showed blitzing speed and a high level of overwelming talent that is rarley seen in the prize ring. Kuddos to David Diaz who showed great courage in the face of being so outclassed. The Cotto vs Mayorga fight was action packed and very entertaining with Mayorga showing alot of attitude and toughness. Cotto also showed great skill and punching power. Katsidis vs Marquez was an absolute barnburner. This is a great Dvd and a good addition to any fight libary.",1342483200,4,717,5.243478260869566
8453741,5,B0052AYDNI,"In the aftermath of the Mayweather/Ortiz bizarro act, I wanted to watch some boxing that wasn't mired in controversy. Because while the undercard bouts on last night's pay-per-view event were solid, how Floyd, Jr. and Vicious Vic ended their contest left a sour taste. GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 48, offering four fighty fights untainted by egregious fouls, happened to be the fix for this boxing fiend.

- Manny Pacquiao vs. David Diaz (June 28, 2008)

There was a time when Manny Pacquiao's repertoire consisted only of jab, jab, left hand, rinse and repeat. When Pacquiao finally developed his right hand - a.k.a. the ""Manila Ice"" - that's when he ascended to the stratosphere. People bring up Oscar de la Hoya as the first victim of the new and improved Pacman, but I instead submit his masterful pasting of David Diaz. But, heck, you can even bring up his earlier third fight with Erik Morales, and I won't argue.

David Diaz was considered a tough and durable opponent with a granite chin, and he was the reigning WBC Lightweight Champion when Pacquiao took him on. From jump Pacquiao looked natural as a lightweight, his frame naturally comforming to this new division. And David Diaz, plodding come-ahead brawler, was made for Manny's combative style. All night long, Pacquiao strafed Diaz with sensational right hands and jackhammer lefts, and Diaz, prone to cuts, soon exhibited his quota of claret, nicks, and swolls. In his corner Diaz remarked that he could handle Manny's power, that it was the speed that confounded him. And that's no lie. David, gutty but overwhelmed, just couldn't mount his own offense since Manny hardly ever eased off. The nonstop potshotting finally paid off for Pacquiao in the ninth round, as his short left hook tested the wilting Diaz's chin and found it wanting. And that was all she wrote.

But I wish Diaz's hilarious, gracious, and profane post-fight interview had been included here.

- Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez vs. Matthew Hatton (March 5, 2011)

Coming into the fight, if Matthew Hatton, a second-tier type fighter and the Hitman's younger brother, thought he could beat boxing's latest heartthrob, Saul Alvarez, like a red-headed step-child, that notion soon vacated his brain. Even before the bell sounded to herald round one, it seemed obvious that Canelo had all the advantages. Bigger. Younger. Stronger. More hair. The only thing that Hatton may have edged Canelo over was in the category of pastiness, and that not by much.

Ultimately, Alvarez's firepower and constant aggression were too much for Hatton. If Hatton was waiting for Alvarez to tire or to lose his poise, well, he's still waiting. Canelo is a formidable young pugilist, composed enough to not get wild, brutish enough to impose his will, focused enough to fire off his artillery with precision. He touched the pillow-punching Hatton early and often, and it wasn't long before the  Brit was rendered discouraged and settling for surviving to the final bell and occasionally resorting to low blows. There may be only one Ricky Hatton, but his brother, sad to say, is a dime a dozen. Saul Alvarez earned himself a fairly easy shutout victory, and he looks to be more and more legit each time I see him (the latest being last night as he took out a game Alfonso Gomez). I'd try to jump on Canelo's bandwagon, only I think all the screaming, swooning girls would just shove me off.

- Miguel Cotto vs. Ricardo ""El Matador"" Mayorga (March 12, 2011)

It's no secret that El Matador is as technically savvy as a banjo strummer from the Ozarks. But a fully engaged Ricardo Mayorga usually translates to pleasing action, and so it was, on this night in the MGM Grand. The wildman from Nicaragua is so mouthy and insulting that it's easy to paint him as the villain. But he's also been one of the most consistently compelling characters in the Sweet Science for a while now. He's an undisciplined brawler with power in his chopping right hand, but he's also vulnerable. Boxing commentator Jim Lampley once dismissed him as ""the sport's most willing target."" Miguel Cotto, cool and emotionless, Mayorga's opposite in demeanor, exploited Mayorga's shortcomings.

Cotto and Mayorga treated the crowd to exciting heavy exchanges, although the most entertaining moments were whenever Mayorga made a beeline to a corner and animatedly exhorted Cotto to come in and brawl with him. Except that Cotto, perhaps mindful that this is only his second fight at light middleweight, would have none of it and stuck to his boxing tactics. Mayorga may have had his best moments in round seven as he appeared to have hurt Cotto. But then Cotto quickly righted the ship in round 8. And in round 12 his counter left hook would deposit El Matador to the canvas after a delayed reaction. A few more howitzers from Cotto and Mayorga opted to wave off the fight himself, later citing a left hand injury. But Mayorga's ego was probably more bruised than that hand.

- Juan Manuel ""Dinamita"" Marquez vs. Michael ""The Great"" Katsidis (November 27, 2010)

Maybe drinking one's own distilled wee really does give you those indispensable nutrients. Of all the fights on this GRANDES PELEAS volume, this one is the most thrilling and the most competitive and the most emotional, and I regard it to be the DVD's highlight, despite Pacquiao's brilliant performance against Diaz. Boxing fans knew, going in, that the then 37-year-old Marquez had his work cut out for him against the rugged Greek warrior, auditioning as he was for the Pacquiao fight (with Sergio Martinez, another potential Pacquiao opponent, having scored a phenomenal KO over Paul Williams the week prior). And Katsidis, dynamic pressure fighter with otherworldy stamina, was motivated for this bout like never before.

Greek tradition dictates that forty days after the death of a loved one, there is a celebration. Forty days after his brother died, Katsidis stepped into the ring against the master technician, Juan Manuel Marquez, determined to honor his departed sibling. Because of this, and because in the latter stages of Marquez's career he'd begun to shed his safety-first persona, we were treated to an absolutely mesmerizing take-no-prisoners scrap. Katsidis, as is his wont, came on like bloody blazes, putting the pressure on Marquez. And it even worked in the early stanzas, to the tune of a crunching left hook which toppled Dinamita in the third round. But Katsidis couldn't capitalize as, in his excitement, he began to launch wider and wider punches and Marquez, cerebral and savvy, was able to find the spaces in between for his pinpoint counter-salvos. Katsidis, heart and guts and iron will, kept on coming, even though, as the rounds progressed, he only sustained further punishment. But even Katsidis has a breaking point, and as the fiery Greek warrior steadily fatigued, Marquez only became more accurate and more devastating. For what it's worth, the fans were mesmerized by nine bloody brutal rounds of fisticuffs and by how, ultimately, Marquez spectacularly closed the show. On that night, Marquez and Katsidis demonstrated the dichotomy of the hurt business, how it could be so violent and grotesque and yet such a beautiful and honorable thing.

In international soccer competition, after a match, the players on one team would often trade jerseys with players from the other team as a show of appreciation and respect. Katsidis and Marquez, hours after their exhilarating war, autographed and exchanged with each other the shoes that they wore for their fight. In light of such classy sportsmanship, how the Mayweather/Ortiz fight went down smarts even more.",1316304000,7,7627,4.999211977935382
