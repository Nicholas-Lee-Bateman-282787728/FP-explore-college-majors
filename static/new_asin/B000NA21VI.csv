2762551,5,B000NA21VI,This series is a great family show.  My girls (16 and 11) both enjoy the the plot line.  It even has my husband and myself anticipating the next epoisode.  I would recommend it!,1199577600,6,177,4.303030303030303
2762552,5,B000NA21VI,"Flight 29 Down is a wonderful family show.  I really do not care if it is a ""Lost"" clone, it has none of the violence and sex associated with Lost, which is an ADULT show.  This show is meant for kids, and is great for all age groups.  This show teaches kids how to take responsibility, how to deal with conflict, how to ""survive"", and how to learn to get along with others. The actors are all great, and the show has a great message.  I stop whatever I am doing and watch this with my son on Discovery Kids everyday!  We are excited it is on DVD, and cannot wait until the movie comes out!",1181174400,3,590,4.051724137931035
2762553,4,B000NA21VI,"Flight 29 Down... there's been quite afew varying opinions based around this show. Young teens love it, others scorn it claiming that it's a ""Lost"" rip-off.

But, I hadn't heard ANY of this when I turned on the TV waiting for my episode of ""Tokyo Mew Mew"" to come on, and I accidentally discovered this.

Yes, the acting can be lacking at times, and some of the lines seem forced, but you become interested in the characters, especially Jackson, and you do start to wonder- whats going to happen to them? All of the characters have a diffrent side. It isn't obvious by the first season alone though. You need to see the second season to notice changes- especially in the characters of Taylor and Eric.

But this chidrens television fare is entertaning, and can be viewed by all ages- I watched it with a 4-year-old, a 13-year-old, a 15-year-old and of course myself (sixteen) heck, even my dad and some older friens of ours watched it with us and enjoyed it. Its not very complex, but it's fun, and very addicting.

For readers, I reccomend getting the books, you get character insight that the TV show doesn't give you.",1178755200,7,1120,4.585
2762554,5,B000NA21VI,I've only seen 2 episodes of this show yet I'm dying to see more! I'm actually about to buy it now because I don't actually get it on my own TV unfortunately. It's not really much like LOST.. but I love both the shows actually. Corbin Bleu is my favorite =),1178409600,,257,4.0588235294117645
2762555,4,B000NA21VI,"This is a great tv show for anyone!  My brother and I would watch it together with my mom.  SHe's 42, I'm not telling mine, and my brother's 7!  Its great and always surprising.  I can't wait for the upcoming movie and last season.  Its Lost for Kids!",1177113600,,251,4.145833333333333
2762556,5,B000NA21VI,"Hopefully this DVD release will be good because this show is my absolute favorite. Season 1 was better than season 2 but overall the show is awesome. The storylines are so simple but so addicting! Just watch one episode and you'll be hooked!! Even though almost all the characters are supposed to be 16, most of the actors are older but I don't mind because I'm one of the older viewers of this show (21!) so can better identify with them. People are going to say that this show is a rip off of Lost but it's really not at all, plus it was developed before Lost. If anything, Lost copied them; it just become more well known. So, just go watch this show! You'll love it!",1176422400,,670,4.283464566929134
2762577,3,B000NA21VI,"I like the show, but I didn't want to pay $5 dollars for just two 22 minute episodes and crappy bonus features.  If you like the show buy a season or the complete series because volume 1 only has two episodes",1361664000,,208,4.073170731707317
2762578,5,B000NA21VI,This is one of the best shows I've ever seen on television. It is about a group of kids that were on a school trip flying when their plane crashes on a deserted island. They must use what they know in order to survive. Will they make it off of the island alive? I don't know yet. I haven't finished the show but I'm sure the ending will be great. This show would be great for the whole family. Any age will enjoy watching this! Stars Corbin Bleu from the High School Musical franchise.,1358208000,,485,4.170212765957447
2762579,4,B000NA21VI,"I initially watched this show with young nieces and nephews. It grew on me. I'm a huge fan of ""Lost"" and this has been called ""Lost"" for kids. I agree. The rip-offs from ""Lost"" are unmistakeable. But don't let that put you off. There should be no overlap. Watch ""Lost"" but let your kids watch this. And watch with them. Makes for a really pleasant Saturday morning.",1357344000,,365,4.462686567164179
2762580,5,B000NA21VI,"I am not a teenager not even close.  I caught this series by accident and watched this show from beginning to end.  I won't give the ending away but this show shows that our young are smarter and stronger than most older people give them.  These kids were all different types and it wasn't easy but slowly they got together and over came everything that was thrown at them.  This show is good for the young or older and I recommend it highly.

It was interesting to see how they over came their problems and solved them.  Usually the shows are about adults so it was nice to see how the younger generation would survive.",1350432000,,620,4.3478260869565215
2762581,4,B000NA21VI,"My 10-year old daughter happened upon the show when on a trip visiting the grandparents and loved the series.  At first it snagged her attention was because it had Corbin Bleu from High School Musical and Jump In, but she soon loved the way all the characters had to work with each other and overcome differences.

Since we didn't have Discovery Kids channel at home, I researched the program and decided to purchase it for her.  We sat down together to watch it and I found it overall wholesome and enjoyable.  No bad language and the characters (while sometimes static and fall into the same behaviors) were able to problem-solve and ""use their words"" to create solutions.

It can be predictable at times and who knows what would have happened if the boy genius hadn't been along to point them in the right direction--how come so many shows have the one know-it-all character these days??--but it also teaches tolerance and patience can make friends and colleagues out the least expected people.  The show demonstrates that people are more than the labels kids (and adults) so quickly use on one another.",1237161600,4,1106,4.794736842105263
2762582,4,B000NA21VI,"I really enjoyed watching this show and I'm glad it's available in its entirety on DVD. The relationships between the kids, both good and bad, make this very watchable and worthwhile. Great for the kids and adults.",1216771200,,214,4.8108108108108105
2762583,5,B000NA21VI,"Great cast and show.  The show has kids from all backgrounds in a crisis situation using common sense, coming together in a positive way to ensure their survival.",1213574400,3,162,4.785714285714286
2762584,5,B000NA21VI,"I can't say enough good things about the series Flight 29 Down. My kids and I watched the first season on broadcast television and loved it. The cast is outstanding. When Discovery Kids decided to drop their affiliation with CBS, we anxiously awaited the release of season 2 on DVD. Season 1 finds the castaways stranded on an island after their plane crash lands during a storm. The pilot, along with a few of the kids, sets out to explore the island and the story follows that remaining kids as they attempt to set up camp near the crash site. They must search for food and water and establish shelter. A power struggle develops as various members attempt to direct the activities of the group. Themes include the development of survival skills, leadership, team building, and the concept of democratic rule. The idea of democratic rule versus anarchy is especially prevalent in season 2, which is also highly recommended.

(Parental Note: one of the characters wanders around in a bikini in a couple episodes of seasons 1 and 2)",1212192000,2,1031,4.759776536312849
2762585,3,B000NA21VI,"Our family loves the Flight 29 Down series!  We had seen it in small installments on Saturday morning TV, and were excited to purchase the DVDs and watch it all together.  However, I think the entire Flight 29 Down story COULD have and SHOULD have been put together in one single DVD package.  Each individual DVD volume is just too short.  Buying only Volume 1 will leave you hanging...and disappointed.",1204329600,,404,4.728571428571429
