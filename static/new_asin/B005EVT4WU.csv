4668253,5,B005EVT4WU,Awesome movies and for the price you can't beat it!,1405987200,,51,4.2
4668254,5,B005EVT4WU,"I love PIXAR movies but since Disney took them over the prices have sky-rocketed and stayed there!  I was finally able to purchase this box-set for what it is worth; not what they want to charge.  Be patient, people; wait for the price to drop.  Otherwise, Disney will keep extorting our hard-earned money for their old movies!",1398038400,5,327,4.701754385964913
4668255,1,B005EVT4WU,"Even though I purchased what I thought was the original Disney version, it was made in the UK, so one of the voice actors was speaking with a British accent, different from the original we had had on the DVR",1396656000,3,207,4.2
4668256,4,B005EVT4WU,"Cars 1 is a wonderful movie!!! However, cars 2 seems like a completely separate movie and not a seaqual. I'm a grown adult and that movie was a little hard for me to follow (although that may have been due to the fact that I wasn't really paying close attention to the movie). None the less, my son enjoyed both movies so I guess that's all that matters.",1394582400,2,354,4.220588235294118
4668257,3,B005EVT4WU,While the discs run great and my son loves them both of the cases are cheap and flimsy at best and one was already cracked when it got here. If it weren't for that they would get all 5 stars.,1394150400,2,191,3.8

4668259,5,B005EVT4WU,"No issues with blu ray playing. Only difference between this and the American version is a minor character (Harv, the agent) is voiced by a different actor in the first one! Kids haven't even noticed!",1489190400,2,200,4.742857142857143

4668281,5,B005EVT4WU,"My toddler loves Cars, so I decided to get him this double set. Since it's a region free version, it's going to play in anyone's Blu Ray player, but be advised that this is actually the UK version of Cars. The only difference I could find was that McQueen's agent, Harv, is voiced by Jeremy Clarkson (of Top Gear fame) instead of Jeremy Piven (of skipping work due to made up sushi-induced mercury poisoning fame). My kiddo noticed immediately that he got smarmy British Harv instead of smarmy LA Harv, but he was OK with it because he enjoys Top Gear just like his mama.",1465257600,13,571,4.447619047619048

4668289,5,B005EVT4WU,"Looked everywhere for cars 2, due to the fact my son likes to watch number 1 on repeat and let's face it, it was time for some variety in our lives. I ordered the set because my son has played our original cars dvd until it skips and now that we have blue-ray this set was perfect. Love the box to group them together for storage. If you have a boy who loves cars as much as mine I'm sure this would be a great addition to your movie collection.",1457308800,3,445,3.9555555555555557
