1887766,4,B00009PY3P,"first let me say this is a very well made underrated movie with a wonderful story and lush scenery. You must see it since i am sure many havent. Might be more a drama however is quote horrifying. Now my 2 problems. 1 is that the lead actress is terrible. Her acting is very phony, however she can pull it off cause shes very pretty. 2 is the ending. Cheap special effects for such a well made movie and the ending left alot to be desired. I would dream of this movie being remade with like Nicole Kidman or someone to that affect playing the main part and with a suitable ending. All said though DEFINATLEY worth buying",1060560000,,619,4.254237288135593
1887767,3,B00009PY3P,"What ""In The Mouth Of Madness"", tried and failed to do, ""I, Madman"", pulls off brilliantly. A woman obbsessed with an author who only wrote two books then vanished, finds that the more she imerses herself into the book's world, the more the book's world, imerses itself into her world. But is it reality, or just in the poor woman's mind?
So pop this little mo9vie into the DVD player, turn off the lights, and get ready for some fun :)",1055635200,3,436,4.395061728395062
1887778,2,B00009PY3P,"I just bought the movie today. The rating is not for the movie itself. I love the movie. I got excited for a bluray release so that I could finally have a widescreen edition of this movie. The special features weren't bad. I wasn't expecting much in this department due to the movie's age. The reason for the rating is this is not a true widescreen edition. I'm watching the movie and something seemed off. This feeling nagged at me enough that I found my dvd copy of the movie, which is full screen, and put in my computer to play. I got both playbacks of the movie to the same point and paused it on the same scene. On the bluray playback, it looks like they cropped a bit more off the top and the bottom and are calling it widescreen. Unless you need to have the special features, get the dvd edition instead. You'll still get a great movie, but with more on the screen for the dvd edition.",1442534400,,893,4.228070175438597
1887779,5,B00009PY3P,Always loved this little film. This release is superior to the MGM so it's worth the upgrade.,1440806400,2,93,4.529411764705882
1887780,4,B00009PY3P,"I've watched this movie numerous times and I still like it. Yes, it's definitely a B-movie, yes, the stop-action creature is low-tech, yes, the movie could have been better, but so what - I still like it! If you're looking for a straight horror movie, keep looking, as you probably will not like this film. It's really a well-thought-out, retro-modern, romantic comedy/melodrama/horror movie with some really nice touches thrown in.

Here's what I especially like: an old, ratty, dusty, used book store piled high with old, ratty, dusty, used books that you can spend hours and hours browsing in (they are fast disappearing if not yet totally extinct); the menagerie of characters who frequent same; creepy, lurid trash novels from the 1940s and 1950s; a quite sinister but hammy, Phantom of the Opera/Dr. Frankenstein love-sick (what they used to call, torch-bearing) villain; vivid flashbacks to the 1940s; and of course, Jennifer Wright who acts her fanny off in this little cult charmer.

Will everyone like it? No, but who really cares? Not I! For me this movie is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food. I start smiling every time I push the play button and stay that way all the way through the movie - including the ending credits with the lushly corny, original rendition of the 1950s hit song, ""Chanson D'Amour.""",1433030400,5,1324,4.95945945945946

1887782,3,B00009PY3P,"I,Madman has a small cult following  and I'm not sure why as to me it's just a average horror film. The beginning scene starts out strong but after that the pace really slows down for the rest of the film. Scenes are drawn out, waiting for something interesting to happen. We do see some cool kill scenes with the Dr., but the journey to each scenes are long and tedious. Part of the problem is also the main actress, Jenny Wright, who is absolutely hot but has no acting ability whatsoever so it becomes somewhat of a task to sit through her scenes. The best parts of the film is when the Dr. appears and kills. It's worth seeing for this creepy villain/monster, but beyond that pretty boring. Also, in the beginning and at the end, this old song is playing called  Chanson D'Amour, and it's fairly effective in a creepy way.",1426636800,,826,4.427631578947368
1887783,4,B00009PY3P,"The premise isn't that unique, a woman reads a book and as she reads it she is transported into the time period of the piece.  Since she's an actress/bookstore clerk, it's not that difficult to imagine her carried away by a good read.  But for the viewer, these changes are abrupt and troublesome to discern (is she reading and seeing herself as the star of the story or is she occupying reality, albeit on shaky grounds, and dealing with the supernatural?).  When she tracks down information on the author she learns that he escaped from a mental institution and may or may not be dead (the body in question couldn't be identified).  She also learns that the author only wrote two books, which he considered ""confessions"" (and therefore nonfiction).  When murders start happening around this woman (Jenny Wright), that mirror scenes from a book titled I, Madman, she turns frantic, trying to convince her cop boyfriend (Clayton Rohner) that the murderer ""got out of the book somehow.""  His response to her lapse of the rational, ""how can you read this crap?""  The villain of the story (Randall William Cook) does a hatchet job on several people before revealing a face that is not entirely his own.

This movie has a certain amount of style that I appreciated.  It does fit in nicely with the slasher genre.  The acting is not exceptional but it works.  It's that bizarre ending that I really-really love; it's unexpected and yet makes perfect sense.",1426032000,,1451,4.78714859437751

1887789,5,B00009PY3P,"If you are a fan of creature features from the eighties then you will not be disappointed in this film. I saw it as a teenager and loved the stop-motion animation on the creature. I had to get it again as an adult to see if it stood the test of time and I still loved it the second time around. The story is unique, creepy, and a little dark. If you are a horror fan then this is a film you should have on your shelf. It feels like a low-budget film, an Indy, but somehow it transcends the banal. The fabulous Jenny Wright (who played the part of Mae in Oscar winner Kathyrn Bigelow's vampire pic Near Dark - Tangerine Dream's soundtrack was epic) elevates this film. There's something so fragile in her portrayal of Virginia in I,Madman, yet she manages to play her curiosity and 'geekness' with a sexiness that is compelling and a pleasure to watch.

I had a Video copy but I finally updated to a DVD. I wish I had bought this with the Prime offer. I thought I was saving money buying through a seller. Big mistake.

1887793,4,B00009PY3P,Bought it just for the description alone and glad I bought it because this was a very fun and different kind of horror movie about some lady that's obsessed with horror books and reads one one night about a serial killer and it freaks her out. Next day apparently someone dies that she knows and that's how the character dies in the book. So is the book coming to life? Guess you'll have to pick it up to find out.

1887797,4,B00009PY3P,"Virginia is thrust into a world of murder and mayhem where the lines of fantasy and reality begin to blur as she gets deeper and deeper into a chilling new novel: I, Madman. What she doesn't realize is that the further she reads, the closer she comes to bringing the nefarious Dr. Alan Kessler to life! Tibor Takcs tells this thrilling tale of mystery and suspense with a sharp wit and a classy sense of style. Takcs dresses the film in the same lavish colors and stylized characters that you would find in your average pulp fiction magazine from the 40's and 50's, but mixes in the dark, suffocating mood of a Film Noir. The subtle shift in surroundings as Virginia slips in and out of her own fantasy world are gradual enough that we, the viewers, have trouble deciphering fact from fiction. Jenny Wright is given many opportunities to shine as she drifts between a number of different personalities that occur throughout the novel. Visual effects designer Randall William Cook also takes a playful stab at acting as our eccentric villain, whose undying love for sweet Virginia drives him to slice off his mangled facial features and replace them with those of his victims. I, MADMAN is a clever entry in the Suspense/Thriller genre that will hold a certain appeal to fans of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS.

1887800,3,B00009PY3P,"This 1989 shocker was released during the new craze of slasher films so one could appreciate the ""novel"" (pun intended) theme of I, MADMAN.
The premise is fairly simple:  the crazed killer in two pulp novels magically comes to life in order to win the affections of his love---who happens to be the sweet thing who has recently read his books.  Of course she knows what's going on but no one--even her detective boyfriend--will believe her.  So the disfigured corpses start piling up and our heroine must face the madman alone...until-----I won't spoil it for you!
Aside from the sometimes implausible script, the film's main problem is the lackluster performance of Jenny Wright.  She's certainly lovely, an eighties version of Sandra Dee or Carol Lynley (showing my age LOL).  But she's no Jamie Lee Curtis in the scream queen gallery.  She's flat, reticent and not convincing.  Clayton Rohner fares better in his role as her droll, humorous boyfriend.  Randall Cook plays Dr. Demented and also supplied the good make-up effects and the strange stop-motion creature--a subtle nod to the great Ray Harryhausen.
I MADMAN is disposable entertainment, there are thousands worse---and better.  A stronger lead could have made it better.",1309737600,,1233,5.125

Wright IS beautiful, and she makes this a much better picture by underplaying rather than going 'over the top'. Kudos to the director also, who knew how he wanted the picture to look/move.",1300406400,2,381,4.701492537313433
1887803,3,B00009PY3P,"I remember Roger Ebert liking this quite a bit. When it hit video, I lent a copy to my father. When I asked him what he'd thought, he said, had I been in the room when it was over, he would have strangled me. Well, I guess I'm somewhere in between. It had been some time since I'd seen it so I figured to give it another shot and see if the years had been at all kind to it. Well....yes and no.

Others have recounted the story so I won't bother, but this is a rather cool and quirky tale. That it has the ""lurid, pulp"" sensibility and the retro 40s, 50s look in some scenes is a plus. And there are some cool touches throughout, like when the one victim gets scalped and the next shot shows a wig store in the background. Some of the ""noir"" style set lighting adds to the overall camp appeal. Yes the acting is substandard and the special effects for the creature are bargain basement but this is an enjoyable flick none the less. Kick back with this one on a Friday night with a beer and some pizza and you could do considerably worse.",1278633600,,1037,4.108374384236453
1887804,5,B00009PY3P,"When I saw NEAR DARK, I remember being mesmerized by this young, talented, and yes, beautiful actress named Jenny Wright. Years later, I found her again in this film, I, MADMAN. She is again fantastic, as once again her character's coy, gentle nature shines through the dark horror around her. Ms. Wright plays Virginia, a woman obsessed w/ a gruesome novel about a murderous maniac who will stop at nothing, including brutal homicide and self-mutilation, to prove his ""love"" for the woman of his desire. Virginia is drawn into not only the story, but the life of it's author, Malcolm Band as well. She soon discovers that the book has somehow come into reality, and people she knows begin dying in awful ways! I, MADMAN is a solid creeper, with some humorous touches throughout. I expected the killer to be a sort of Freddy Krueger clone / parody, rather than the truly malevolent force he turned out to be. Cook is wonderful in this tortured, demented role. Yep, I, MADMAN is a perfect little spooker. Jenny Wright should have been the queen of her generation's horror movies, instead of disappearing like Candace Hilligoss! I can only imagine the work she could have done...",1211932800,2,1177,4.802955665024631
1887805,4,B00009PY3P,"I, Madman has great mood and atmosphere and is an all around fun horror film.  With 24 out of 26 reviews at this time being 5 or 4 stars, 12 each, I don't feel this is underrated as far as who views it, those who see it like it or love it.  However I don't think enough people, including myself (until recently) saw this film, this is definitely a hidden gem.  I highly recommend this film to horror fans looking a good fun time.

So, back to the film and the great mood and atmosphere.  Virginia a bookstore clerk who is reading a horror book in her cozy homey apartment on her couch with a blanket while it thunders and rains outside, what a great set up, we as viewers are getting that warm cozy feeling ourselves.  She gets nervous but soon her police officer boyfriend comes over and turns on the lights and all is good again.  This gave me the feeling of when your a kid and you rent some horror films for a sleepover with friends maybe you exchange some stories about oh did you hear about this house or what happened to this kid, or perhaps your watching a double feature on cable when all of a sudden your mom comes in and starts vacuuming, essentially vacuuming the ghosts and it gives you a break from that rush you are getting.

Virginia is not a teeny bopper she's an independent woman with as I said a nice warm apartment.  Her job at a bookstore is one of those antique mom and pop stores that would be rare to get a job at, not some Barnes and Noble where you work with 50 other people and nobody has a personality.  Virginia would have fit right in with the girls from Sex and the City.  She has one co worker in this Bookstore who works a lot and seems to really like her job as well, she's a funny and good person as are most of the people in this film, filled with positive vibes.  At this antique bookstore with great character her friend/co-worker even takes in a stray cat to add to the warmth of the shop.

I refer to The Neverending Story as the kid is in the attic of his school while a storm is going on and reading a book by candlelight wrapped up in a blanket the story starts becoming real, as does this story.  Did I say real?

So, like Virginia we get all ready to be cuddled up and scared, as she reads her horror book and we watch our horror film.  Sometimes a fun campy horror film gives you a warm feeling, it is just a film and you are nice and safe in your house, can give you a feeling of security with some excitement.  For Virginia her fun doesn't last long, and oh, what is that thing in the attic of the bookstore, the big box with holes in it for something or someone to breathe?

I would have given I, Madman 5 stars but the ending gets a bit ridiculous, but that's fine this is a fun movie from start to finish with great atmosphere and mood with likable good characters who we root for.  A great 80s slasher horror movie.  So if your gonna have a little horror film marathon with some friends or a significant other get a blanket, dim the lights, wait for a thunder storm , pop some popcorn, and make I, Madman the first one you watch to set the mood right for some good fun scares.",1188172800,,3129,4.140495867768595
1887806,4,B00009PY3P,"Bookstore clerk and aspiring actress, Virginia (Jenny Wright), has a taste for lurid pulp horror.  Her latest bizarre book find, entitled ""Much of Madness, More of Sin,"" spins the tale of an insane doctor and his mutant jackal boy creation.  Virginia is so taken with the book that she sets out to find author Dr. Malcolm Brand's only other published work, a book called ""I, Madman.""  Instead, the book finds her.

Waiting for just the right reader to release him from the pages of his 30-year-old book, the deranged Brand escapes into the real world to recreate the gruesome murders of the text.  Virginia becomes Brand's primary witness to the murders and the focus of his obsessive love.  Reality slips sideways as Virginia finds Brand stalking her at her bus stop and at the book store where she works--even gaining entrance to her apartment.

Malcolm Brand (Randall William Cook) is both a frightening and pitiful villain.  In his book, Brand is obsessed with ""Anna,"" a beautiful actress who will have nothing to do with him because she finds him so physically unattractive.  Believing Virginia to be ""Anna,"" Brand slices off his facial features so that he can replace them with more classically beautiful ones that he culls from Virginia's friends and acquaintances.

Trying to make sense of the madness she is witnessing, Virginia tracks down the small company that published the deranged doctor's books.  Virginia discovers that the books were published as works of ""nonfiction"" at Brand's insistence.  The author believed that the characters in his books were real and were acting independently by refusing to do what he told them to do.  Brand wound up having a complete nervous breakdown and was committed to a psychiatric facility--where he later died.  Some of the film's darkest humor comes from when Virginia tries to convince her boyfriend, Richard (Clayton Rohner), a reality-grounded police detective, that the recent spate of horrific murders are the work of Malcolm Brand, the long dead author.

The film has a retro/pulp comic book sensibility to it--with deep shadows, exaggerated camera angles and vivid paint box color gels--much like those in the ""Tales from the Crypt"" series or the ""Creepshow"" movies.  I found the movie to be a lot of fun, with odd and imaginative twists throughout.  The special effects may not be state of the art (the clay animation scenes looked downright funky), but the makeup prosthetics on the demented Malcolm Brand's butchered face will make your hair stand on end.

1887809,4,B00009PY3P,"Growing up in the 70's and 80's I was constantly bombarded with television commercials that proclaimed `Reading is Fundamental', or RIF, for short...I suppose it was a concerted effort by some group of well meaning individuals to get us cartoon addicted youngins away from the magic box and into the library...but what they failed to mention is that, besides being fundamental, reading can also have serious detrimental effects to your health, possibly resulting in a slight case of death.  Don't believe me?  Then I would recommend watching I, Madman aka Hardcover (1989) for conclusive proof...you may be shocked at what you learn...directed by Tibor Takcs (The Gate), the film stars Jenny Wright (The Wild Life, Near Dark), Clayton Rohner (Just One of the Guys, April Fool's Day), and Randall William Cook, who worked on all three of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films (not in the capacity of an actor, but as effects artist).  Also appearing is Stephanie Hodge, whose face I recognized but couldn't place until I looked up her credits and learned she's not only a comedian, but also appeared on the Fox television show ""Unhappily Ever After"", along with the amply bosomed Nikki Cox, who does not appear in this film.

Wright plays Virginia, a literate, attractive woman and aspiring actress who makes ends meet by working in a used bookstore, and has an affinity for seedy pulp fiction novels from the 50's, particularly ones penned by an author named Malcolm Brand.  The trouble begins as Virginia notices that the horrific events in the novel start to translate into real life, as fiction becomes fact, and she's somehow centered in the middle of it...soon she starts seeing the villain from the story, a skulking, darkly garbed killer (Cook) who wears a mask over the lower part of his face (looking much like The Shadow), is a whiz with the straight edge razor, and seems to have the ability to appear from nowhere.  The police are baffled by a recent spate of strange and unexplained murders, but Virginia notices the similarities between the events in the book and those in real life, and believes she can predict the killer's next move.  She offers this information to her boyfriend Richard (Rohner), who's a police detective, but Richard and his colleagues are a little skeptical (okay, a lot skeptical) and think her like a Snickers bar, you know, a bit nutty.  As the police investigation eventually goes nowhere, they become more inclined to listen to Virginia, but it may be already too late, as the killer's motives and intentions are revealed, along with a few interesting facts about the now deceased author Malcolm Brand.

At a time when slasher films were run of the mill, I, Madman presented a clever and interesting story tinged with a bit of the gothic, but I think it ended up getting lost in the shuffle as the genre grew stale, as studios had bled it to the point of anemia (the lame trailer didn't help any).  The movie has the slight feel of a Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) film (the mixing of realities), but director Takcs avoids Craven's style as a blueprint.  He knows how to set up a scene and creates a level of tension and suspense that kept me drawn into the story throughout.  I really liked how he handles the violence in the film, as it wasn't shown very often, but you always knew what was occurring.  There is a good deal of violence in the film, but it is rarely shown on screen.  An example of this is when Virginia is watching from her apartment window the killer stalking a victim in a building across the way.  The killer draws the shades, but the silhouettes of him and his victim are clear, as is the subsequent actions, and the audience is left to fill in the rest in their imagination.  There's another scene where a woman is getting attacked in her bathroom, and while we know what is going on, the violence is obscured as the scene is shot from behind the killer, but it's clear what's happening due to the killer's almost exaggerated movements.  I really liked the use of color and atmospheric elements throughout the film, as they helped create a feel, a mood that other films in the genre lacked, or tried to develop but failed miserably.  Also, his transitioning between time periods (the main character would often imagine herself as part of the stories she read) was flawless.  I thought the actors all did very well, most all playing their roles within character, never really hamming it up or going overboard.  The makeup on the killer (done by the person who played the role) was exceptional and quite gruesome, giving the character a realistic quality.  Were the flaws in the film?  There may have been, but I really didn't notice...I feel if the effort is there, and there's enough solid material and decent performances, I find myself willing to overlook certain superficial elements that may work against the movie.  I suppose if I were to pick on something it might be the stop motion work.  Most parts looked good, but there were one or two moments where it didn't feel entirely lifelike (given the probable limited budget of the film, picking on this would be an easy target).  Takcs usage of stop motion in his previous film, The Gate (1987), looked much the same as here, but since I liked that story as much as I did this one, it was easy to dismiss any perceived faults.

My only disappointment of this film was in its' lackluster DVD release.  Presented is only the fullscreen format.  Why MGM couldn't have dug up the original wide screen format and included it also is beyond me.  The picture quality is decent, and the vibrant colors come through most of the time.  The only extra is the lame theatrical trailer.

I saw this film in the VHS  release as HARDCOVER. It retains the same superb  tone as THE GATE, in which it seems that the same stop motion animator has been used.

Takacs seems to know how to go one step beyond, and the leading Lady is great; comments to the contrary are just sour grapes. Also, to have Nicole Kidman in this film would just destroy it, since Kidman is so horrible at acting.

The word was that the inventor of the Makeup for this film was so good, that Takacs decided to cast him as Malcolm Brand... could be film legend, but I don't think so.

I have lost count of how many times I have watched this film, and it is great each time. Very escapist, not much gore , despite the  messy cuts in the actors, it is not a splatter  fest. More of a superb  fright fest.

I can't recommend this enough... its a real fun ride at every stage of the twisted, and wonderfully  done , plot.",1106611200,3,950,4.1256830601092895
1887811,5,B00009PY3P,"Interesting, full-blooded horror thriller about a used-book store clerk Virginia (Jenny Wright) who becomes involved in a 50's pulp horror novel and finds the author (who's also the lunatic in the book) apparently stalking her. The mad doctor/maniac of the book is reconstructing his face with facial features obtained from his murder victims to please the heroine. Virginia not only sees the mad Malcolm Brand/Dr. Kessler (who supposedly died) but finds that he's committing mutilation murders around her as in the book. Of course no one believes her. The film has the old fashioned feel and look of a 50's pulp horror novel as well as neat fantasy sequences from the book with Wright as Anna, the book's heroine, being terrorized by Kessler. The murders are gruesome and lurid but not overly explicit. There's also a monster from the book (a creation of Kessler's) that appears in an early fantasy sequence and in the great climax. Randall William Cook (who also did the special effects) is wonderful as the enigmatic, black clad and facially disfigured Brand/Kessler. Wright is good as Virginia, Clayton Rohner is Virginia's detective boyfriend and comedian Stephanie Hodge is Virginia's laconic co-worker Mona. The fantasy vs.reality theme is well handled and gives the film a good, colorful creepy ambience. This is one of the few modern day horror films that actually works as well as entertains. Highly recommended for buffs. Lights out. Enjoy.",1072828800,5,1451,5.1525423728813555

Also the Story and pacing of the film is pretty Good and interesting.  I do believe the other reviewer who called this film a ""Rarely Seen Gem"", this film is very unique and original on a shoestring budget. I guess that is what you get when you have a team of filmaker's who Actually DO care about the Final product !!! Kudos Guys ;)",1070841600,5,487,4.126315789473685
1887813,5,B00009PY3P,"I'll keep this brief since there are so many other great reviews.  This movie impressed me so much when I saw it I went on to write a paper and give a presentation about it while in college for video production.  It is one of my favorite horror movies.  It is so much more like a CLASSIC horror movie than any of the hack and slash garbage that usually comes out. It is more based on suspense and drama than gore.  The gore is actually rarely shown - it is more implied through sillouttes and other interesting camera shots.  Great story, great lighting and great symbolism make this a keeper...BUT...Why in the world is it only available Full Screen?  That is so disappointing, as I've been waiting for this to come to DVD since I got my player.  Oh well, sometimes you just have to make due with what's available.",1065916800,3,815,4.3933333333333335

Given this is the only way to get this gem on DVD though, we gotta shell out the money.  Even in full screen this movie can't be beat.

1887815,5,B00009PY3P,"For what it is, (a low budget, theater/movie channel nonentity) ""I, Madman,"" is pound for pound the best movie of it's genre from the late 80's and early to mid 90's. One can tell that this movie was a labor of love, if not from the actors themselves, then from those behind the scenes. Jenny Wright is hit or miss in her scenes, as is Clayton Rohner. Not that this really detracts from the movie, they both do an adequate job. The real star of this show is the ""Madman"" himself, Randall William Cook. Cook, (Dr. Kessler/Malcomb Brand?) steals every scene he is in. There has not been, in my opinion, a villian of his caliber since Dr. Hannibal Lector. Now, about the DVD itself. There are no extras other than one movie trailer, which bills the movie as ""Hardcover,"" and subtitles in French, English, and Spanish. If you want to watch an innovative movie that is rich on suspense, with a good portion of horror, buy this movie. You will not be disappointed. Plus, the cover looks pretty cool, in a pulpy kind of way.",1062028800,2,1017,4.473118279569892

7992377,4,B00009PY3P,"I saw this movie many years ago and was tickled and enchanted by it. Don't mistake this little treasure for a 'serious' horror thriller, like so many reviewers have. It's a really fun, totally 80s tribute to sleazy pulp thrillers, to the book lovers who consume them, and to escapism in general. The plot is silly -- a mousy bookworm finds a rare book by a demented author, and the nasty events in its pages come to terrifying life for her, leading to a truly delirious climax. It's totally camp in a very 80s way, and the photography is all lurid eye candy and melodramatic stage lighting, and it's funny as can be. If you love books at all, you'll completely sympathize with the heroine in her vain attempt to stop reading the evil book and avoid the terrors to come. The fun, like with Pulp Fiction,  is in the stylish execution and unashamed love for trash. The actors all do a fine job of overacting amid the creepy scenery, the villain (Clayton Rohner) channels Dan O'Herlihey perfectly, and altogether it is a highly entertaining, campy romp that no serious fan of trashy thrillers could possibly help but enjoy.

Basic plot is a girl finds a book by an author, really gets into it & seeks out his other book I, Madman. When she gets her hands on it, things from the book seem to be happening in real life, including the killer seemingly coming out of the pages. Now she must find a way to stop the killings. Storyline was very good, kept me interested in what was going to happen next, acting was good as well. The killer was also well done I feel. The blood & gore that is seen, while not a lot when compared to other horror films is good & effective. Special features include trailer, interview, gallery & a making of feature.
