Includes rare, never before seen footage of Ray's animation test shots, great close ups of Ray's animation models, and great interviews with fans of Ray's that have been inspired by him and gone on to make amazing fantasy and sci movies themselves. Any true fan of Ray will love this documentary. A warning for American Harryhausen fans: this is a Region B only disc and will only play in European blu ray players. American Harryhausen fans {like myself} will either have to wait for its release in the US in a version playable on US blu ray players, or buy an all-region blu ray player, which runs about $130 from Amazon US. I went ahead and bought the all region player to watch the disc. Absolutely recommended blu ray for Harryhausen fans!!",1372723200,12,788,4.717391304347826
5539994,5,B00B06GF3Y,"Anytime one of Peter Jackson, Terry Gilliam, John Landis, Guillermo del Toro, James Cameron, or Steven Spielberg takes time out of their busy lives to be a part of something like this, I'm interested. In this case, they all did which makes this a must see for me! I watched Harryhausen movies growing up too (child during the 60s) and really enjoyed them. The story of Ray Harryhausen, how he got his start and expanded his work is inspiring just as it is for these other directors for me. A person following a deep passion growing up and then making a living at it inspires me to continue in my own efforts.

If you like special effects this story is about how they started and evolved into what we have today. Stop motion animation may not be of interest but it's all they had and it inspired the people that are using every method available making movies today.",1495929600,3,864,4.468354430379747

5540005,5,B00B06GF3Y,"RAY HARRYHAUSEN: Special Effects Titan is a breath of fresh air in documentary movie making the same way Harryhausen's work is a breath of fresh air in the realm of special effects.

Here we have a documentary that spares us the annoying tell-you-what-to-think voice-over that is so typical of this type of film. Instead we are treated to a volley of on camera admirers from Spielberg on down who acknowledge Ray Harryhausen as the innovative genius that he was.

Generous clips from Harryhausen's films illustrate his work even as it is described in such loving detail by his fellow cinematic artists.

Made s few years before his passing and when he was still spry and articulate, RAY HARRYHAUSEN: Special Effects Titian benefits greatly from interviews with the great man himself.

One interesting point of conflict occurs when director James Cameron opines that, if he were working today, Harryhausen would unquestionably embrace the latest CGI technology. Yet in stark contrast to that we hear Harryhausen say that he wouldn't. Cameron, who has pioneered many contemporary special effects, understandably believes that the latest is the best. But Harryhausen has a point. Today's effects might be flawless in terms of execution, but does that very achievement undermine the humanity of it all? Consider looking at a painting generated by a computer then compare it to one of the great masterworks of Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Degas, etc. where you can actually see the indentation of the brush hairs--a reminder that a human hand once guided the brush that created the work of art. Perhaps it is a matter of preference and both points of view are valid. If James Cameron or George Lucas stopped making films would there be others who could take their place? Had Ray Harryhausen not been the innovator and genius that he was, blessed with incredible patience, single-mindedness and focus, might another have achieved the same thing? Put it another way, if Cameron and Lucas had come first, would they have inspired Ray Harryhausen?

Surely the point of RAY HARRYHAUSEN: Special Effects Titan is that it is a tribute, a work of love and respect and veneration towards the true titan and father of modern special effects. For every fan of fantasy and adventure who loves dinosaurs and sword-wielding skeletons and a Medusa that sends shivers down your spine, RAY HARRYHAUSEN: Special Effects Titan is a must-have. And, while bowing to Harryhausen's genius, the filmmakers never fawn. This is the difference between tribute and treacle.

An extra feature showing the rediscovery of many of Harryhausen's sculpted creatures that have been packed away in crates for years is like a cross between kids opening their much-anticipated Christmas presents and Howard Carter entering the tomb of King Tutankhamun. ""Is that really it?  Oh my--!!!""

Priceless.",1471478400,,2846,5.1317494600431965

5540007,5,B00B06GF3Y,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

If you're like me you grew up watching some amazing movies in the past. As a child we weren't there to watch movies that were CGI fueled action films or the latest in limited animation series that run non-stop like todays kids. Instead we had to wait for something spectacular to see, something we could beg our parents to take us to that they felt was safe enough for us and entertaining enough for them to sit through. Fortunately we found those types of movies being made and almost all of them by Ray Harryhausen.

But who was Harryhausen and how can we explain the effects his movies had on us as children to the children of today? The first step is easy enough by treating them to some of the many movies he made, all on DVD or blu-ray. But in doing so they don't get both the importance of what he did nor the difficulty he had in bringing his films to the screen. This is remedied with the release of this DVD from Arrow Video. Not only will it give them an idea of the different movies he made it will bring back memories to you as well and start you searching for them.

This documentary features a thorough look into the life and career of Harryhausen in both interviews with the man himself as well as the vast number of directors and writers who he has influenced over the years. It takes a look at each movie that he made and discusses both the difficulty in animating the armatured models he used, the painstaking amount of time and the end results which thrilled so many of us long ago. This was long before computers were being used and each movement, each expression, was made by articulating these models a fraction of an inch at a time.

My guess would be that these won't impress most kids of today but thats where history comes into play. They need to be educated in the process that was used then and informed that without his films many of todays film makers and special effects masters would not be able to do the things they can. His influence was so great that his name alone causes these directors and craftsmen to smile with memories.

To do into details of his life and the things he says here would be to ruin it for fans clamoring to hear the man himself. Watch it and let his own words tell you how he came to be interested in film making and special effects in particular. Learn how he was able to do the things he did. Hear how each movie creations came to be and how much influence he had on them both in design and in follow through.

For fans of Ray Harryhausen I cant stress the importance of being able to hear the man speak about all of these things. He was a giant among film makers, a craftsman who had no equal and the master of a long forgotten art that is slowly making its way in films again with movies like CORALINE, THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. I highly recommend adding this one to your collection. Its just that good.

Extras include interviews with Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Peter Lord and Rick Backer; 12 interview outtakes with Joe Dante, John Lasseter, Nick Park and more; a message from Ray Harryhausen himself; deleted scenes; on the set of Sinbad; Paris Cinematheque Q&A; London Gate Theater Q&A; audio commentary with the filmmakers; the original trailer; and a Ray Harryhausen trailer reel.",1470700800,,3336,4.414634146341464

It has all the same Special Features as those listed here, except one that could be confusing  a reversible sleeve featuring two artworks  basically, the case insert has one side with an illustration of Pegasus in moonlight, cyclops, Medusas severed head, Ymir, & the skeletal army while the other side has an illustration of Harryhausen surrounding by his creations. So if the pictured cover looks different it could still be the same product.

Growing up in the sixties addicted to these Harryhausen films I poured through many a copy of Famous Monsters of Filmland to learn how he brought these wonderful creatures to life. CGI is wonderful for its purposes, but sometimes some good old fashioned stopmotion can be beat. Which actually segues into one of my favorite moments in this documentary. Many creators reflect on the impact of Harryhausens craft  though I wish they could have gotten Rob Bottin to weigh in  and at one point the everinimitable James Cameron opines on how Harryhausen would be using CGI today if he was still filming. And then the very next snippet has Harryhausen saying basically...nah!

5540016,5,B00B06GF3Y,"Ray Harryhausen: Special Effects Titan is a documentary about the man responsible for the creatures in Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans, and many more fantasy films. Inspired by the original King Kong, Harryhausen mastered the slow, painstaking process of stop-motion animation  minutely adjusting miniatures and photographing them one frame at a time to create the illusion of motion.

The film features interviews with Harryhausen (who died in 2013), as well as filmmakers Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and Guillermo del Toro, who were inspired by Harryhausens monsters and mythological creations and discuss how transfixed they were as kids sitting in movie theaters wondering how dinosaurs could interact with human beings, prehistoric beasts could devastate New York City, or men could battle sword-wielding skeletons.

We see Harryhausen in the workshop where he works his magic and displays some of the models that have become iconic after their appearance in fantasy and science-fiction motion pictures. A number of books have been written about Harryhausen, but theres nothing like seeing his work come to life, enhanced with atmospheric music, mood lighting, and expert editing that intercuts live action with animation sequences, often blending the two in the same shot for the ultra mind-blowing effect.

Blu-ray Special Edition extras include interviews with Simon Pegg, Rick Baker, and Edgar Wright; 12 interview outtakes with Joe Dante, John Lassiter and others; deleted scenes; Paris Cinematheque Q & A; London Gate Cinema Q & A; audio commentary with the filmmakers; original trailer; Ray Harryhausen trailer reel; and reversible sleeve featuring two artworks.",1468022400,,1760,5.5559701492537314
5540017,4,B00B06GF3Y,"Whether you are a fan of Ray Harryhausen are not, this documentary is really an entertaining little watch. The opening hooks you with some of the most influential shots of films in the genres of horror and science fiction. After this intoxicating opening, we are made aware that if it was not for Ray, these films would never have existed in the form they are today. Ray was a titan not only behind the scenes but also on the lens. He directed that extensive animation of stop motion that so many movies used sequences in to bring things to light. The film also steps on some controversial ground claiming that his special effects that had the type of prestige early on that had the directors respect and they let him do his thing. I think some people will name drop maybe Savini and a few others in the early days who really revolutionized special effects. The documentary could be seen like a cliffs notes of sorts as we get only parts and pieces of his early years. We learned that at age 14 he was influenced when he saw King Kong. He then taught himself how to do the stop motion animation that he marveled about on the King Kong film. On this documentary we get interviews from a whos who in entertainment and it is very refreshing that the interviews did not seem so random that they had an emotion to them.

What I really loved about this documentary the most is that it had a good pacing. It had such an energetic feel that the subject was larger than life, and that we should all seek his work out or we are truly missing out on something marvelous. I loved that it spent a lot of time talking about his influence in a way that it felt welcoming and passionate. There is not moment on this disc that I feel I was being sold something on. It just felt that everyone wanted to be there, and wanted to speak out. Whether you are new to his work, or you know his films, this documentary makes everyone feel on equal ground in terms of how it is all presented to the viewer. In terms of documentaries lately, this one will rank pretty high on my list. I just loved the way this story made me feel like I was part of the process of this man and his legacy,as should be any fan who witnessed any of his work. This is a must watch for the simple fact that these good docs are very rare these days.",1467763200,,2299,4.248858447488584

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The career of the legendary Ray Harryhausen, the special effects genius who perfected the art of stop-motion and whose monstrous creations in films like The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad who has thrilled both children and adults for decades and inspired virtually two generations of filmmakers. RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN, which has been made over the course of five years, is the definitive documentary about, and tribute to, Ray Harryhausen.

Directed by Gilles Penso, Ray Harryhausen: Special Effects Titan [2011] takes a structurally watchable chronological journey through the acclaimed animator's remarkable career, from first feature Might Joe Young [1949] all the way through the Greek epic, Clash of the Titans [1981]. Never one to decline a challenge, Harryhausen consistently pushed the envelope of visual effects, creating his own bespoke armatures and with the aid of his supportive parents, for almost every type of fantastical creature imaginable.

The 92-year-old Ray Harryhausen, the legendary American film-maker of fantasy films about legends, became hooked on stop-motion animation when he saw King Kong at the age of 13. After a sort of apprenticeship to its special effects designer, Willis O'Brien, he became the greatest figure in the business, working first in Hollywood on pictures like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, and then in Britain since the late 1950s on such films as Jason and the Argonauts, which features the classic swordfight between the Greek adventurers and seven skeletons.

A modest, amusing, articulate man, Ray Harryhausen is the animator as auteur, a craftsman and artist of genius, whose work is superbly illustrated in this riveting film by a French film historian and rightly celebrated by a roster of distinguished admirers, and especially Premier-league directors queue up to pay homage to the animating spirit of the creature feature, among them are Steven Spielberg, Terry Gilliam, Nick Park, Peter Jackson and Tim Burton and many more, who tell us of their continual delight in the body of work that Ray Harryhausen has produced.

These luminaries, and Ray Harryhausen was born in 1920 and pop up constantly as the documentary goes through Ray Harryhausens lifetime career from working with George Pal on the Puppetoon shorts to his first big break working with his hero, King Kong creator Willis O Brien, on Mighty Joe Young all the way through to Clash Of The Titans, after which he retired as he felt that his type of film was becoming outdated. Ray Harryhausens face is cleverly merged into the poster of each film as the documentary races through the pictures at top speed. Some films are not talked about very much and things temporarily veer off into other matters. The film and trailer clips [some films are only represented by trailer clips, which is odd] are very brief which is fine, because it youve been unlucky enough not to have seen a Ray Harryhausen picture you will have been given enough tantalising clips to whet your appetite. If you have seen some, or indeed are like me and have not only seen them all over twenty times but have read a great deal of material about him including his own books, you won't learn much that is new, but you will be thrilled to visit Ray Harryhausens study, to see that most of his work has been preserved, and see some previously unseen test footage and on-set shots which Peter Jackson is aiding the digital restoration of. I will be counting the days until these treasures are released.

Of course a distinct sadness creeps in. Some of todays special effects geniuses almost seem to lament the fact that anything is now possible with CGI and that the wow factor, where you see something on a cinema screen and wonder how they did it, is fading away. James Cameron says that if Ray Harryhausen was still working today, hed be using all the modern technology at his disposal, but Ray thinks hed still be doing things his way, working alone in his garage, often taking a day to shoot just one second of film, but at least having total control, and in the process adding some of his own personality to a living skeleton, or a giant walrus, or a six-armed living statue, rather than it being the work of hundreds of people and coming out rather soulless. Often the idea of realism takes away from the feeling of magic, but to me a lot of CGI doesnt look anywhere near realistic anyway. I suppose it depends what you grew up with, but I doubt that anyone could see the roping sequence from Valley Of Gwangi even today and not be amazed.

The onscreen, tactile magic of stop-motion, still infinitely aesthetically preferable to me over CGI, was the result of the most painstaking, detailed and dedicated work, and Ray Harryhausen's recollections and anecdotes about the process are a pleasure to see and hear. As many of those interviewed admiringly point out, Ray Harryhausen was an actor as well as a technician, a skilled illusionist who imbued his creations, never 'monsters', with such personality that audiences engaged, and often empathised, with them.

While Ray Harryhausen himself sees CGI as just another tool available for creating the 'magic' of cinema, several directors and effects artists hint towards that 'magic' being dissipated by the dominant effects techniques of our time. There is no doubt that those working primarily in CGI are as dedicated, gifted and creative as Ray Harryhausen in their own fields, it's just that the physical presence of his effects work is that little bit more special, to these eyes at least. Judging by the interviews in the documentary, many actually involved in the film-making business feel the same way. The term 'legend' is for once entirely justified in its use.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Arrow Films presents this Blu-ray disc with a mixed bag of footage here, from new 1080p HD interviews, to some really shoddy quality 480i video interviews from a while back. There's even stuff that goes all the way back to behind the scenes footage of Ray Harryhausen's films and early projects. They are all tied together nicely but this documentary doesn't really do much to get excited about picture wise. All the old film clips look pretty great in the presentation and I could rattle on about textures on participants faces and colours and such but it seems a bit fruitless given this is a documentary. Generally highlights are the HD shot original models used in Ray Harryhausen's films, those are probably worth the HD price tag alone for fans who really want to study the incredible detail involved in this classic fantasy film creatures, so all in all Arrow Films has given us a good video presentation, especially with the limitations of the old material supplied to this special film documentary presentation. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Arrow Films presents this Blu-ray disc with a standard 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio track. Once again, it hardly seems worth talking about the audio presentation. It is overall level of performance is clear and a sometimes crisp with the collection of talking head interviews inter-cut with the odd clips from the old films. There's the occasional volume hike when each film gets introduced to the documentary via a small animated splash but really this is a solid collection of interviews recorded in different environments but all perfectly adequate for the piece. Overall Arrow Films has brought you something truly special and something to be treasured.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Tony Dalton [Co-producer]; Gilles Pensco [Director]; Alexandre Poncet [Producer/Composer] and Timothy Nicholson: This audio commentary was recorded at the La Cinmathque Franaise in Paris, where all four introduce themselves and eager to talk about the genius that Ray Harryhausen is and this brilliant documentary film. When start to see a clip of Ray Harryhausen at the start of the film, Tony Dalton informs us that particular was filmed by Tony about 12 years ago, which Tony personally shot for this documentary film and it is the only film that shows Ray Harryhausen working on one of his mechanical puppets., somewhere in North London. One fascinating fact we find out from one of the French guys is that the documentary film took over a four year period, but started shooting eight years ago, but even more amazing is that it was done on a zero budget, because to them it was a labour of love and respect for the genius that is Ray Harryhausen. Gilles Pensco and Alexandre Poncet were worried while making the documentary film that they could not get any filmmakers or directors that were fans of Ray Harryhausen to appear in their film, which initially they were just going to insert photos of each particular person, but once word got spread around that these two French guys wanted them to be interviewed, they were all soon very eager and enthusiastic to participate in the documentary film and not one of them asked for a fee, on top of all that Gilles Pensco and Alexandre Poncet got tremendous help in acquiring all the very rare test film clips and were offered to them completely free. Gilles Pensco and Alexandre Poncet talk about how honoured they were able to interview Nick Park of Aardman Animations in Bristol, because he was so enthusiastic and a massive big fan of Ray Harryhausen, because of the type of animation they do, which is very similar to Ray Harryhausens work and of course Nick park was filmed next to the skeleton models and  Gilles Pensco and Alexandre Poncet says that Nick Park definitely had a twinkle in his eyes being next to the rare skeleton mechanical puppets. Tony Dalton filmed all the personal film footage of Ray Harryhausen in his longue sometime in 2007. When we see some of the rare Black-and-White test shots, we are informed they were remastered by Peter Jackson and some else and they all comment how stunning they look. When we see Steve Johnson for the first time, they all praise him and says he is a very clever person, but Gilles Pensco and Alexandre Poncet says they wanted to interview Sam Raimi, but sadly and unfortunately he was not available to be interviewed. They all talk about the wonderful Bernard Herrmann and the wonderful film music composed for Ray Harryhausen films, especially for the film The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. All four talk about the film Mysterious island and what enjoyable time they all like viewing it and it is Tony Daltons favourite of all the Ray Harryhausen films for him personally. As we get near to the end of the audio commentary, they finally get round to talking about James Cameron and his personal input in getting this documentary film off the ground, and especially getting the copyright clearances for all the film clips used, and it took up to nine months to get the whole thing completely finished, and all of the film studios they contacted were incredible helpful, but of course it could not of all happened unless everyone agreed 100% to waver their copyright fees, but sadly there was too films they wanted to use clips of, but the particular film studio wanted to ask for a horrendous amount of money. But one sticking point was with 20th Century Fox and James Cameron sent a personal E-mail to them and begged them to waver their copyright fee and if they would not do that, then James Cameron told them he would pay for that copyright fee personally. They talk a lot about the daughter Vanesa Harryhausen, who was at first reluctant to talk to the camera about her early days with her father and the fun times Vanesa had, but they said I don't know why Vanesa was concerned, as they thought Vanesa was very natural in front of the camera. When near the end you see Steven Spielberg with the microphone in his hand on the stage and it was at a press conference in Paris, and it Steven was the last person to be filmed for the documentary, and Gilles Penso and Alexandre Poncet like Steven Spielberg when he talked to the auduience, as it was like if he was just talking to one person personally and both Gilles Penso and Alexandre Poncet really liked that about Steven Spielberg, and could of listened to him for ages. Gilles Penso and Alexandre Poncet were really pleased to get all of the private home movie clips of Ray Harryhausen, and feel it adds cachet to the documentary film. They all talk about near the very end of the documentary film about when you see James Cameron talking direct to the camera and getting very emotional about Ray Harryhausen and how hit affected him wanting to go into filmmaking, especially when growing up and seeing all of Ray Harryhausen films, and this also goes for Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson when they have their final word on Ray Harryhausen, and all four in the studio also get emotional hearing those three directors speak and how they also love and admire Ray Harryhausen. But as the documentary finally comes to an end, all four say that they had a wonderful time getting involved in making the documentary film, even over such a long period of time, and Tony Dalton and Timothy Nicholson heap great praise onto Gilles Penso and Alexandre Poncet for their sterling and professional job on making one of the best documentary film on Ray Harryhausen. Also throughout the documentary film, Tony Dalton and Timothy Nicholson praise Alexandre Poncet for his brilliant composed film score for the documentary film, because they could not get the copyright clearance for the music on all the film clips used and shown, and Alexandre Poncet says although doing the film score was very hard, he feels very proud to have achieved what he did. And finally, they all thank us the viewer and hoe us listners ejoyed listening to their audo commentary cmtribution, well I did very much and I know anyone purchasing this Blu-ray disc will also get a great kick out of hearing this very personal audio commentary tribute to Ray Harryhausen, the master of stop motion film fantasy animation.

Special feature: A Treasure Trove [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:36] In June, 2009, the Myths and Legends exhibition opened up at the London Film Museum, gathering famous items for the legendary Ray Harryhausen archives. In November, 2010 and January, 2011, director Gilles Penso and producer Alexandre Poncet were invited by Ray Harryhausen and the Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation to film other rare models held in the Ray Harryhausen archives. They along with Curator Tony Dalton and associate producer Tim Nicholson rediscovered a real A Treasure Trove. At the start of this video documentary, we find three people in a garage with massive amount of boxes ready to open, and with the first one open we get a glimpse of some real treasure trove of wonderful rare model goodies sent to them from Ray Harryhausen. The people in that garage are Gilles Penso [Director] who is getting very excited in what is about to be revealed, and the other two people are Tony Dalton [Co-producer] who is frantically opening the boxes and Tim Nicholson [Associate Producer] is sort of helping. But out of the blue, in pops Alexandre Poncet [Producer] to see what is going on. But as time goes on more and more boxes are opened to reveal all of the famous Ray Harryhausens rare models used in all of his films. As we see all of the rare models being delicately unwrapped and revealed, suddenly out of the blue we get this background music build up and I have no idea why this was used, as it annoyed me for about 30 seconds, and suddenly fades away, then about a minute later, the dreadful music starts up again, which again I felt was a pointless exercise. At the end of this short video film, we get an announcement that The London Film Museum exhibition closed in late October 2012.

Special Feature: Interviews [2013] [1080i] [1.78:1] 00:00] Here we get a selection of four individual interviews, which consist of Edgar Wright; Peter Lord; Rick Baker and Simon Pegg. What all these four fans of Ray Harryhausen have in common is that after originally seeing the stop motion fantasy films at the cinema when they were younger, made a great impression on them, which gave them in later life an incentive to go into a career in films, especially special effects films, and they all feel Ray Harryhausen is a total stop motion fantasy film genius. You can either watch each interview separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Interviews Outtakes [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [55:24] Here we have again another selection of this time 12 interviews that could not be fully shown in the main documentary feature on this Blu-ray disc and the following outtake interviews are with the following people: Colin Arthur; Dennis Muren; Greg Broadmore; Joe Dante; John Lasseter; Ken Ralston; Martine Beswick and Caroline Munro; Nick Park; Phil Tippett; Randy Cook; Steve Johnson and Vanessa Harryhausen. Once again you get a great deal of praise about the genius of Ray Harryhausen and his impressive stop motion fantasy films, and how they all feel he was the leading light with his adventurous and thought provoking filming techniques, as well as being ahead of his time. But once again we hear from these 12 individual people how it affected them personally when viewing his stop motion fantasy films when they were young and that it left a massive impression on them and also wondered at the time how did Ray Harryhausen create such impressive stop motion filming techniques. But what was really nice about this particular outtake interviews, was finally getting to meet his daughter Vanessa Harryhausen and hearing her personal stories growing up with her father Ray Harryhausen and especially living with her father and seeing all the magical items he created for his stop motion fantasy films and actually playing with the creatures he created and also watching his work on his stop motion fantasy films. You can either watch each interview separately or Play All.

Special Feature: A Message to Ray [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:00] Here we get to hear some very personal tributes from the people who they loved and that were inspirational to their career and to also salute the genius of Ray Harryhausen and we hear from the following people, who are: Ray Bradbury; Ken Ralston; Randall William Cook; Guillermo del Torror; James Cameron and Vanessa Harryhausen. But with this particular special feature, you cannot play each interview separate. This was a Frenetic Arts and The Ray & Diana Harryhausen Foundation presentation.

Special Feature: Ray Harryhausen Special Effects Titan Deleted Scenes [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:19] Here we get to view eight individual special deleted scenes, which consist of the following: First Take; Sharp Stars; Nathan Juran; Dino On Wires; Chaffey & Cooper; Hessler & Rozsa; Fighting Kali and The Touch of Harryhausen. But before we get started, we get some introduction information, that reads as follows: The first cut of RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN documentary film was 106 minutes long. Though that extended version was richer, the pacing was a lot slower, especially after the Jason and the Argonauts chapter. A decision was made to cut 10 to 15 minutes from the film. Most of those deleted scenes are presented here, in a very rough video quality, with unmixed sound. Since those sequences were abandoned before copyright clearances, you may notice some missing clip messages here and there. You can either watch each deleted item separately or Play All. This was a Frenetic Arts and The Ray & Diana Harryhausen Foundation production.

Special Feature: On The Set of Sinbad [2011] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:59] Gilles Penso and Alexandre Poncet originally wanted to produce a stop motion opening sequence for the documentary. They worked with Sacha Feiner, a Belgian filmmaker and special effects wizard. Due to budget limitations, the concept was abandoned, but before leaving the project, Sacha Feiner gave the authors a Super 8mm reel filmed by his own father, Alex Feiner, in the late 1950s . . . on the set of The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. The only sound you hear is the 8mm projector working.

Special Feature: Paris Cinmathque Q & A [2012] [1080p] [1.78:1] [18:39] This particular Question and Answer session, that is both in French and English, was filmed on the 14th December, 2012, at the La Cinmathque Franaise in Paris and is a French film organization that holds one of the largest archives of film documents and film-related objects in the world and the archive offers daily screenings of worldwide films. Up on the stage to answer the audiences questions were Gilles Penso [Director]; Tim Nicholson [Associate Producer]; Alexandre Poncet [Producer/Composer] and Tony Dalton [Co-producer]. Throughout the session the people on the stage in front of the big screen were being asked several questions from the audience, which were What was your intention when you did the documentary. How did you get all the film clips?  Did Ray ever consider remaking King Kong. Why was Ray so severe towards Terence Fishers Gorgon? What can you say about Rays collaboration with Frank Capra? Do you think that Ray Harryhausen would work with CGI today. Iy sounds like Ray Harryhausen hates Godzilla! What is Rays Favorite Creature? Do you think that the legacy of Harryhausen is visible in visual effects of today? All in all this was really lovely and fascinating question and answer session and we also hear some totally fascinating and extraordinary replies from the panel on the stage and is definitely well worth viewing.

Special Feature: London Gate Cinema Q & A [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:56] This is a Ray harryhausen Special Effects Titan rare question and answer special session event with Ray Harryhausen and was filmed at the London Gate Cinema, which is an Independent arthouse cinema with ornate auditorium, tables between seats and imaginative programme, that is located in the Notting Hill Gate area of London and the event was held on the 9th November, 2012. Up on the stage with Ray Harryhausen [who sadly looked very frail] was Alexandre Poncet; Caroline Munro; Tony Dalton; Gilles Pnso; John Landis and Nick Park. Once again we get lots of questions from the audience, which were as follows: Ray, which is your personal favourite of all the creatures you have created? You also get up on the screen certain statements that read as follows: Ray Harryhausen asked about the models he has created. Ray Harryhausen on the inspiration his films have given. Gilles Penso, Alexandre Poncent and John Landis on the film-makers that was not able to be included in the documentary film and especially with Rays place in cinema history of film. John Landis on Technology and Rays Digital film-making. Once again this was a really fascinating question and answer session, and some of the answers we hear were brilliant, but the only thing was when everyone clapped, the sound was so harsh and terrible. This was a Tiger Digital presentation in cooperation with the Digital Media Services.

Theatrical Trailer [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:47] This was the Original Trailer for the documentary film RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN. It is a brilliant presentation, but unfortunately the background music is so loud, it nearly drowns out the audio presentation from the announcer.

Ray Harryhausen Trailer Reel [2013] [480i] [22:15] With this special Ray Harryhausen trailer reel, you get to view nine individual Theatrical Trailers of Ray Harryhausen films and they include: The 3 Worlds of Gulliver; The 7th Voyage of Sinbad; 20 Million Miles To Earth; Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers; It Came From Beneath The Sea; Jason and the Argonauts; Mighty Joe Young; Mysterious Island and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. With each different trailer they are shown in either 1.33:1 or 1.78:1 aspect ratios and also in Black-and-White and Colour, but the quality varies greatly to very grainy, to some in very good quality. You can either play them separately or Play All.

Finally, we all would like a definitive book on Ray Harryhausen or a definitive documentary about the master animator Ray Harryhausen, but we definitely get close to it that covers everything that is satisfactory to every one of us and this Blu-ray disc RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN you need in your collection. Ray Harryhausen only worked on fifteen feature films, but like Stanley Kubrick or Sir David Lean, his few works are so superior to the competition that Ray Harryhausen remains legendary to this day. For what it is, this film is absolutely fantastic and really good. It has bunches of the usual talking-head interviews, but with true luminaries whose hero Ray Harryhausen was, inspiring them toward their own eventual greatness, but also the Blu-ray has plenty of film clips and behind-the-scenes footage, some extremely rare, so well worth purchasing this Blu-ray disc, especially if you are a fan of this totally brilliant special effects animation hero Ray Harryhausen, like I am. This thrilling small screen release, RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN is a testament to the imagination and the magic of the cinema. Highly Recommended!

5540020,5,B00B06GF3Y,"From this documentary, which I caught through Netflix steaming, I learned that I had seen every single one of Ray Harryhausen's films, several of them multiple times. My personal favorite was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-and-the-Argonauts/dp/B003HTSJ9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason and the Argonauts</a>&nbsp;(and I bought it in progressively upgraded formats), which I've seen to date at least fifty times.  However, all of them were immensely entertaining and they satisfied my need for high-quality monster movies.  If there was a story there, too, all the better.  This documentary traces the professional accomplishments of Harryhausen, in chronological order, beginning with snippets of his earliest experiments as a teenager with stop-motion animation, and ending with the opening of a foundation aimed at preserving the artifacts of his art.  The film is loaded with interview footage with current highly accomplished film directors and effects artists, describing the profound impact his work had on them, and lots of face time with the man himself, as he reveals his earliest influences -- primarily&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-1933/dp/B001R6G34I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong (1933)</a>&nbsp;-- and retraces his career.  There is a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff, explaining how the effects were accomplished, and through it all, you grow to appreciate the magnitude of this man's dedication.  The most remarkable quality of his character is that, through it all, he is man of true humility, who seems to be only remotely aware of the epic influence he's born on modern fantasy and sci-fi filmmakers.  The fact is, if you're watching a sci-fi or fantasy film, you're watching the work of someone who'd been influenced by Harryhausen.  Yet Harryhausen remains completely unassuming, and talks about his accomplishments in an understated way.

If you love sci-fi and fantasy movies, this is a documentary you're sure to enjoy, as this man is the grandfather of them all. It closes with comments about the aforementioned foundation and his 91st birthday.  But Harryhausen has passed on (IMDb has his death listed as the 7th of May, 2013) since the completion of this paean to him, so the film includes no epitaph.  What a life.  Thank you, Mr. Harryhausen, for the hours of sheer enjoyment you've brought me.  But you've probably heard similar comments thousands of times.

5540024,5,B00B06GF3Y,"when ray harryhausen casually refers to willis o'brien as ""obie"", i knew that i was in for a treat.  built on a combination of interviews--many with harryhausen himself--and clips from his movies, ray harryhausen: special effects titan is utterly sublime.  ray speaks matter-of-factly about his love of dinosaurs, and his development of stop motion effects and various tricks of layering camera photography.  he tells of his apprenticeship with the great mr. o'brien, and his ascension to special effects guru of the fifties, sixties, and even into the seventies and early eighties.  luminaries from ray bradbury to steven spielberg to james cameron to joe dantek, speak of harryhausen's impact on them personally, but also on fantasy films in general. and we get to see the many homages that run rampant through almost all fantasy films made since. as many of the interviewees attest, ray is THE maker of monster movies.

it is awesome to see--and feel--the love for harryhausen.  this doc is expertly produced, and also gives up the goods, showing clip after clip of harryhausen's best and most iconic work.  we get to see ymir, rhedosaurus, cyclops, the giant octopus, gwangi, joe, sword fighting skeletons, and others.  we hear from the master himself, how he created these creatures, got his ideas, storyboarded, and surmounted obstacles.  one really gets an appreciation for the intense patience, commitment, and artistry that goes into creating stop-motion effects.

When I ordered it the company that I ordered from failed to mention that it could only be viewed in the UK.
My son opened it and could not watch it and that's when we found out that it is marked as such.
It was a very disappointing day since we are now out the money and cannot return it (opened) and cannot watch it.",1391904000,5,410,4.1375

There have been many documenaries on this incredible genius's work and each one seems to go a little further that it's predecessor. This is the best one I've seen to date! It covers all of his works, has on screen interviews with RH and his loyal professional fan base. Why this hasn't been released in the U.S. is a mystery, but I suspect a U.S. release will be coming.

Rumors of a Harryhausen Blu Ray box set to be released in 2015, hopefully it will include all of his films, shorts, and all extras and documentaries from previous releases. It should include this one as well. There are some decent extras on this release including extended interviews, and trailers for most of his films, Why Golden Voyage, Eye of the Tiger and Clash of the Titan's were left out is strange?

Here's the scoop. This documentary follows the career of Ray Harryhausen, as the title notes, special effects titan. It shows his early entry into the industry, the highlights in his work and delves into the various techniques he used to achieve his greatest wonders.

The format here isn't different than anything you've seen before but the content is so astounding you don't really care. It's great they were able to get Harryhausen himself to speak of his history and talk of how he did what he did. He puts in a lot of small anecdotes to add flavor to everything. They also show various directors and film historians to note both his impact on their work as well as what it meant to the movie-going audiences. They choose some choice clips from his  films and walk you through the process of how they came about. Since he knew what the end result was supposed to look like he was always present on the set to work with the actors on how they needed to play a particular scene. Some of the films' directors didn't much care for that but, as some of those interviewed mentioned, ultimately those films didn't belong to the directors. They belonged to Ray Harryhausen. I didn't realize certain films I'd not seen were his so now I'll need to go back and check them out. Right after I finished this I was compelled to screen ""Jason and the Argonauts"". As much as I enjoyed it, I gained a whole new appreciation for his work.

If Ray Harryhausen was any part of your film history, this is a must see.",1384732800,,1759,4.470404984423676
5540032,4,B00B06GF3Y,"With little or no help, the late motion picture visual effects specialist Ray Harryhausen painstakingly created and stop-motion filmed the creatures in these science-fiction and fantasy flicks:

TWENTY MILLION MILES TO EARTH

And, before we all got into monster and adventure flicks, we saw Harryhausen's animated children's films such as RAPUNZEL and THE STORY OF ""LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD.""

The 2011 documentary RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN features clips from all those titles, a treat for those of us who appreciated those exciting works at the movies or, more recently, on television.  We may not realize Ray Harryhausen is the one person responsible for all those cool creatures but the likes of Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, James Cameron and other filmmakers interviewed here do.
