8324546,5,6305068313,"I was really moved by this movie, and am glad that I got the opportunity to see it.  I really like Hope Lange and I felt for her character.
It's a timeless struggle... people being unable to find your life fulfilling or meaningful.  Course I love all the early 70's stuff - the Vera Neumann scarves and red carpets -  in addition to the attitudes and perspective.

****Contains Spoilers:
Some very good lines:
""Maybe if I wasn't doing all the cleaning... I'd have time to do important things"".
""We are special to each other, aren't we?""
""People change""
Oh and this scene ""She speaks highly of you""  ""She should... she's one of my best friends"".

The mother/daughter scene was lovely.. ""You've got choices"".
OMG do I feel that the ""free love"" sentiment was bull.  The ""non-exclusive, non-possessive"" stuff is a lie.  The whole thinking is best expressed by the character in the movie, ""I was being selfish"".",1466121600,,906,4.726114649681529

8324548,5,6305068313,"This late 60's or early 70's film is ONLY rated 5 stars because it captures a unique period in our cultural history when women were just beginning to understand they weren't objects owned by men/husbands, etc. It is a beyond corny plot when viewed today, but emotionally kind of shocking for those of us who were young in those years, to remember the reality of how wives were stripped of any sense of identity, etc. And in the very opening scene of just a few seconds of young women strolling along together, you get to see a glimpse of Deirdre Flynn, daughter of Errol Flynn, who lived in the LA area at the time and was a fascinating, brilliant, complex young woman who also worked as a stuntwoman and behind the scenes in other films too. Her name is in the credits but all you get of her is that brief shot - no dialogue from her - she is the dark-haired one. A tomboy in real life, it was strange to see her in a dress, but this may be the only film she appears in......",1434326400,,976,4.224598930481283

8324550,1,6305068313,I didn't like the fact that she left her children behind.  Leaving your husband is one thing but hurting one's children for something they didn't have anything to do with was terrible.  I quit watching it.,1428364800,,205,4.666666666666667
8324551,4,6305068313,"I enjoyed this movie. It's an interesting study of a woman first and a wife and mother second. It's what can happen when an intelligent , educated woman marries and has children before finding out what she personally was all about. I was hoping her somewhat macho husband would have seen the light much earlier than he did. Their is hope for some sort of reconciliation at the end , but it's nothing more than hope. There's no way things could go back the way they were",1416182400,,469,4.402298850574713
8324552,4,6305068313,"The girls get together and plant all kinds of things in the minds of  one another about their spouses. Hope Lange's character splits from Earl Holliman's character and seemingly has a different set of rules for seeing other individuals than his. He realizes he has to change things up a little bit if he is going to win her back and they ultimately agree to come 50-50 back toward one another to see if they can make it work. It really does a pretty good job of depicting how things were between the genders back in the day. Men felt as long as they worked every day and took care of their spouse that would be enough. It probably would be enough if you kept them at home being the good wife, taking care of the kids and they weren't exposed to what's out there. Today there are so many distractions and people who will seize upon those and that's why so many couples don't get to 50 years. Both actors did a good job of portraying a couple who got a little bit out of synch. It was obvious they cared about one another but the film was over before you could see reconciliation and building back of the relationship.",1415145600,,1116,4.289099526066351

8324554,1,6305068313,"Wish there was a zero star rating. This movie started with our heroine being told she was unfulfilled, then being told to lie, then worsened from there. Instead of marriage counseling to work toward her husband understanding her unrest, she walks out on him and the kids, lies to get a job but then the show later says that's ok because then she's being considered for a promotion by the woman who knew she lied, breaks her family further apart by having her daughter come to live with her, has an affair, is upset with him, is really upset when her husband is now doing the same. I hated the ending, nothing was resolved, really, and her actions seemed sanctioned. These people needed God, plain and simple,  for any real changes to be made.",1403481600,4,742,4.537313432835821
8324555,5,6305068313,"I'm a fan of the work of actress Hope Lange and although I think some people may not enjoy the material, the story told in I LOVE YOU, GOODBYE, kept me interested and served as a nostalgic journey for me.  The film was made in 1974 as a made for TV film and also stars Earl Holliman as Lange's husband, who is an actor always interesting to watch. The film description on IMDB is accurate: ""A suburban wife begins to resent the pressures she sees society putting on her as a wife and mother, and leaves her family to find the meaning of her life.""  Natural and down to earth acting from all of the cast draws you into the story.  Oddly what came through for me most was the movie being about ""hope,"" and I refer to the word ""hope"" here as meaning ""expectation and desire,"" not Ms. Lange's first name (although the pun was intended). It's all about failed expectations and how one moves forward in life dealing with the many failed expectations that come with the lives we lead.  Life is also filled with expectations that are successful, of course.  I LOVE YOU, GODDBYE is about how all of us create new expectations for ourselves and others and while the effort to adjust can be taxing for all concerned, the ability to make room for each other is a sign of kindness and maturity.  Back in '74 perhaps I would have given this 4 stars, but rating it today, and viewing it as a valuable mirror to the times it was created in, I easily now give it 5 stars.",1390089600,5,1454,4.3076923076923075
