4533836,5,B00538VYFY,"Very entertaining show.  As a dude...I don't care for all of the lovey dovey stuff.  But the vampire scenes are fantastic and the plot is extremely well done.

This show is a more mild version of True Blood.  Not nearly as much sex/violence/cursing as its HBO cousin.  I am a little old school, so I like that there aren't boobs in every scene.  This show is just as good (if not better) than True Blood simply because the show doesn't have to flaunt sex in every scene just to keep people interested.  Plus the Vampire Diaries doesn't have fairies.  Which is always a plus in my mind.

Highly recommend.",1357776000,6,604,4.467889908256881

8455062,5,B00538VYFY,"I haven't personally read the book series, but nonetheless I can say that I, like many other people, figured this show was going to be another 'girl falls in love with boy, boy's a vampire' type of deal. It definitely feels that way throughout the first season though like most first seasons of shows they tend to typically get better after. The setting for this vampire tale takes place in the town of Mystic Falls, there you'll meet Elena and her friends, typical high school students. Though things change once she starts her first day back at school...I'm not going to ruin what happens you're just going to have to watch and find out.

Another reviewer said something about not getting two slips of papers in their disc trays - I ran into the same problem, but really I'm basing my review on the show itself and not a paper insert. To some people this might be important, but I didn't feel like it took away from my viewer experience whatsoever.

I think the only real thing that annoys me is the menu set up when you want to watch the special features. It has special features for each disc, yet when pulling up the guide itself it'll ask you if you want to watch the special features from disc 1,2,3, or 4. Though it didn't make any sense as to why disc 4 special features would be an option if say you were on disc 1. Thus hitting this option tells you to insert disc 4. Though I'm not expert on menu layouts so this could just be a design technicality.  Still didn't deter me.

So in all if you're a fan of The Vampire Diaries and are debating about buying it, I say you should get it. If you're trying to find a new series to get into, I promise you after the first season it gets a whole lot better. All in all, you won't be disappointed.",1378425600,,1749,4.290909090909091
8455063,1,B00538VYFY,"""I left 1 star because I had to return the item. I couldn't get the DVD's to play in either of my 2 Blu Ray players or in my sons Xbox. I even tried them at a friends house. The DVD's, packaging seemed legit until I received a replacement that I ordered that was sold & shipped by amazon. Now I can see the difference.""",1377648000,,319,3.923076923076923

8455068,3,B00538VYFY,"I realize this is an import product BUT it should still have the episode guide/special features insert.  I contacted Amazon about this and they offered me a partial refund if I kept the set or full refund if I returned.  I'm returning the product and ordered another one.  I ordered through a separate seller (not fufilled by Amazon) but I came to find out that the place I was going to would charge me a restocking fee even if it was missing the inserts (even if it's new) b/c they said import products aren't guaranteed to have them...yeah right!  If one of the seasons has the insert why not the others?  So I cancelled that order and placed another order that would be fufilled by Amazon...b/c I know they won't charge me a restocking fee if it's missing product pieces.  Here's to hoping that the next set will have all the episode guides!  I will update my review when I receive my new blu ray set b/c Vampire Diaries (and Amazon) totally deserve 5 stars!

UPdate:  I found out that this import blu ray bundle DOES NOT come with episode guide inserts for seasons 1 and 2 (I opened my second blu ray bundle). Yes, I realize it seems like a trivial thing but I'd like to have them so I know what's on the discs.  Hence my original two star review for this bundle.  I'm purchasing all the blu ray separately now.  So for those of you out there who want the blu ray guides/inserts don't purchase this product!

I bumped up my two star review to three due the fact that I got it for a great price, it was bundled, and it's VD.  Two stars off for an INCOMPLETE product (missing episode/special features guides).",1359417600,2,1611,4.380471380471381
