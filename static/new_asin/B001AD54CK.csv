The print quality is awful, just as this nightmare of a movie is. It makes Ed Wood look like a genius.",1521417600,,269,4.294117647058823

8277049,1,B001AD54CK,"It is always amazing-- and disappointing--when a top-notch cast appears in such a dreadful movie. The plot,the music, and the camera work insure that this will bore all who watch it-- unless they just  burst out laughing.",1490227200,,221,4.972972972972973
8277050,4,B001AD54CK,"I bought the DVD from Sinister Cinema, a good company.

This is unfortunately the American theatrical version missing the 4th German chapter with Kinski. I saw this film in a theater and it's only 3 segments--Italian, French and American. If you like gritty B&W spy films of the 60's you'll like it. Gassman-Bucella episode is the best.",1342310400,8,336,4.894736842105263
