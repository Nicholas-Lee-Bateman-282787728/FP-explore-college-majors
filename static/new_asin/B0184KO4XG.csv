7539244,4,B0184KO4XG,"The Piper was an interesting film, which borrows from the tale of the Pied Piper.

The setup involves a father, who's on his way to Seoul to get medical treatment for his son. On the way, they stop at an isolated village of recluses, trying to avoid the communists invaders from the Korean War. While there, the father discovers that the village has a rat problem.  He offers his services to rid the village of their pests. But everything's not as it seems, as the villagers have several skeletons in their closet, which come out in the open, once the Piper completes his task. A few twists and turns occur, along with a few acts of vengeance, until the film reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

The Piper did a good job of telling a Dark Fairy Tale. This is not a horror film per se. Although there are some horror elements added to it. Rather it's a twisted tale, that shows how isolation can become its own enemy. Especially when people are driven by irrational fear. In this case, the threat of communist invaders is one of the biggest influences in how the villagers behave. But that's only part of what they're hiding from, as we discover later on in the film.

We also get a slight look at how small villages in Korea's past, might have been run. Having a Shaman was an important component in this story. It also showed how superstitions can affect the decisions people make. Beyond that, the threat of the rats was a bit paranormal in nature. But it adds to the the overall atmosphere of the film.

In conclusion, I gave The Piper 4 stars. It was definitely a film that hasn't been done before. It was different, curious, and a bit disturbing at the the end. But not in an over the top kind of way. It was more like, what goes around, comes around. And when it comes, it might be in the form of rats.",1455667200,5,1820,4.35693215339233
7539245,4,B0184KO4XG,"A musician with a bad foot and a 10 year old son limps into a remote Korean village, post Korean war. The village has no name and holds secrets and ""Ben"" sized CG rats. He convinces a woman in the village to travel to Seoul with him. The piper knows that the war is over, or suspended, and the chief forbids him to tell anyone in the village. This is all woven into a modern Korean version of the classic tale.

There is plenty of blood and a good bit of violence. Unlike Willard, most if not all of the rats are CG. The film moves slowly and allows things to develop and I mean that in a good way. Dubbed in English.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1454889600,2,654,4.062015503875969

8741412,5,B0184KO4XG,"Beautifully written and acted. This was so much more than a horror movie. A glimpse into the aftermath of the Korean War with touches of the supernatural and horror mixed in. You feel deeply for these characters and I found myself bawling like a baby a few times. If your expecting something with a happy ending and everything tied up with a neat little bow, maybe pass on this one. If your looking for an excellent movie that will send you on an emotion roller coaster then by all means, climb aboard.",1531440000,,502,4.467391304347826
