8687714,1,B00PFRFXEQ,Not worth renting.  Plot was all over the place. There are better movies about the Roman Empire out there.,1437177600,,106,4.578947368421052
8687715,1,B00PFRFXEQ,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen - at least the first 20 minutes which was all I could stand.
Whoever wrote the dialogue ought to be taken out back and shot.",1427241600,,165,3.8823529411764706
8687716,1,B00PFRFXEQ,"This was such a horrible movie, I hardly know where to begin with the shredding.

I think this movie was supposed to be some kind of ""mockbuster"" for ""The Last Legion"", which was an excellent movie... but this was just junk. Don't let the cover art or the name fool you. There was no legion in the movie to speak of. No epic battles, or finding of any said lost legion and said legion regaining their honor, or anything.

There was no great plot that centralized the movie. It was just one scheming wench in the far far nether regions of the Roman Empire, scheming with every man around her to make her teenage son Emperor. She bangs every guy in power she can spread her legs for, spouts poisoned honey in every word she utters, and plays everyone around her like marionette puppets. And of course, every guy around her just dances to her strings.

This movie had some of the worst writing filmed this past year. Indeed it suffered from the same bad writing that movies like ""Jack the Giant Killer"" suffered from. The acting was over the top, and bad. Only one person managed not to overact, and that was the protagonist (the betrayed barbarian leader who sat in a Roman dungeon for most of the movie). The directing was surprisingly decent, considering the schlock script he had to work with and the bad actors that were cast, but good directing couldn't save this movie from everything that made it painful to watch.

I guess the director thought that gratuitous nudity and sex scenes could save it, but in the over all picture, it just detracted from this movie and brought it down even further. We aren't talking epic Romanesque film here, like the Spartacus series was.

If you do somehow manage to watch the entire movie, you will be truly p**sed off... why? Because of the ending. This was one of the worst endings to a movie I have ever seen. They didn't resolve anything. The whole thing just stopped.

So let's see... bad script... bad actors... gratuitous nudity and sex... no great plot or any lost legion... no ending so to speak... and decent directing. Take a pass on this... there are so many better Roman era movies out there to see, that is one won't be missed.",1422576000,,2180,4.534351145038168
8687717,1,B00PFRFXEQ,"The best thing going for this movie is the box art. My suggestion is to look over the cover, watch the trailer and move on to another movie. This movie has no redeeming qualities. Other than a few bare babes bouncing about the only thing that can be said about this movie is it is filled with a cast looking for their big break in Hollywood and took this project on to pay the rent and car payment. This movie like the Legion needs to get lost and will never be found because I doubt anyone would go looking for it. On the stinker meter this one rates a 5 star beer fart.",1422489600,,571,4.061946902654867
8687718,1,B00PFRFXEQ,"Don't waste your money buying this...  but, if you did...  try like hell to get a refund,  because this movie really SUCKS.

This movie has really bad acting, no plot except for blatant and continuous treachery, decadence and soft porn, no real historical timelines, the weapons and armor are bogus. I would say that the only redeeming quality about this whole sordid production are the scantily clad cuties that barely keep it afloat.  The North Koreans could have made a better and more interesting movie.

 BTW...  will someone tell me where the hell is this ""Lost Legion"" is???",1421798400,,581,4.857142857142857
8687719,2,B00PFRFXEQ,"The year is 475 AD, the current Western Emperor of Rome is Julius Nepos and in the northern region of this vast empire we meet Maximus Antonius Albanis, he is married to scheming opportunist and widow - Urbina Prima. Her son has a sort of claim to the Empire but has been schooled in the ways of self interest, the use of expletives, bad acting and over dubbing and as such is not fit to rule (or act).

Then we have some war lord getting attacked in some forest and he then gets double crossed in a bid to sway another war lord. All the time Urbina Prima is wandering around half dressed trying to bed anything and undermine everyone till she gets her hands on the levers of power like some obsessive disorder nympho with an allergy to the truth - and clothes, unless they are transparent.

I think that covers the plot. Right the good points are that the uniforms and props are all quite good, there is some correct historical references and the make up is on the money for the most part. Also to be completely fair there is some good to OK acting hence the 2 stars, with most of the main roles being filled by competent players.

Now to the bad bits; this is supposed to be about a lost legion, well I think they went AWOL before filming as there is not one here to actually lose. We do have some legionaries but don't let them near a mic as they couldn't act their way out of a paper bag or the Roman equivalent of a flimsy carrying vessel. The action scenes are filmed on such a small set that I am amazed the cameraman wasn't injured. They also use that slowed down then speeded up, CGI blood splatter filming. This can work in epic productions, but I have seen more rough and tumble down my local pub or even ASDA (Walmart) on Black Friday.

The plot is all Machiavellian, but we sort of don't care. The would be spoilt brat Emperor is lamentable in his script and acting. Then we have the constant nudity - especially of the women who drop their clothes at a drop of a hat or helmet or anything to be honest. Mind you the actors should get a medal for not laughing at some of the ropey dialogue. I do have to congratulate Brian Caspe as Maximus whose imaginative insults of maternal transgressions and choice of faecal based food options were truly the most fun part of the whole thing.

In summation, the cover art is from another film, yet to be made, the lost legion thing is just plucked from god knows where and the whole thing was about as compelling as an anthrax sandwich - I have seen better fridge art - just avoid completely.. IMDB says they are thinking of a sequel, I mean has no one learnt from `Coming Home in a body bag 3' - Jeez",1419033600,16,2653,4.255952380952381
