203433,4,1935127268,"I tried this DVD for the first time today (since it took Amazon more than 5 days to ship it to me).  I've done yoga before so this DVD was not very difficult but it did make me sweat.  I like that the dvd has litle segments (10-15 minutes each) that you can pick from - good breathing, meditation, circulation, balancing, or relaxation techniques.  I have some balancing issues from my immune system attacking parts of my brain two months ago.  I was able to do the segments without losing balance and I felt better afterwards.  My kids(ages 9 & 13)even did the dvd with me without my asking them to do it.  I felt relaxed after doing the dvd.  I like the segments because you can do all of them if you have time or pick and choose on other days when you don't have time.  Ok - this is really superficial but I didn't rate it a 5 star because of the way the instructor was dressed and at some parts I couldn't hear her because the music was louder than her voice.",1316563200,15,963,4.167567567567567
203434,5,1935127268,This is a good start for Dahn Yoga...The instructor is so clear and the exercises are very easy to follow. Thanks to this CD I finally find a good way to meditate.,1297900800,10,163,4.125
203435,5,1935127268,"A complete guided session. One hour of stretching exercises and deep breathing techniques. Dawn Quaresima is an excellent coach thru out. Rejuvenates your spirit. I just need to make myself practice everyday.
Thank you Dahn Yoga.",1259280000,18,229,5.388888888888889
203436,3,1935127268,"It is a reasonable DVD, provided what I expected? It met my expectatios! I just needed the information as I was told it is a DVD that I should have.",1365379200,,148,3.966666666666667
203437,4,1935127268,It's not your normal yoga but it still gives you a good low impact workout. I think it has a place in any yoga program.,1363651200,3,119,3.8
203438,2,1935127268,This Cd is not encouraging and a bit boring; it also not too diverse.  The instructor is trying to talk with Korean accent; it's very funny.  I wish more dahn yoga CDs be available.,1362096000,2,181,4.294117647058823
203439,5,1935127268,"I have a knee injury that does not allow me to do traditional yoga anymore. This past Christmas, my sister in law introduced me to Dahn yoga. I took a class at a Dahn yoga studio in Scottsdale, AZ. It was amazing! I was so excited when I found this DVD on Amazon recently. The instructor on this DVD is knowledgeable, has a pleasant voice and leads you seamlessly through the routine. The only thing is that during the brain wave vibration portion of the routine, her voice is a little hard to hear with the drums in the background. This is very minor though, and you can still follow her by viewing the DVD since brain waive vibration is mostly free-style and very easy to follow visually. Dahn yoga combines yoga, meditation and tai chi. I highly recommend it to all yoga, meditation and tai chi lovers. This DVD is very relaxing, gentle and energizing at the same time. If you have injuries that make traditional yoga poses painful or uncomfortable, try Dahn yoga!!! (after consulting with your doctor, of course). I would also recommend the practice to seniors. So glad to have found this DVD!!! One of the best yoga DVDs I have experienced to date!",1360972800,8,1153,4.548076923076923
203440,5,1935127268,"This is not a traditional type of yoga but if you open your mind you will benefit tremendously.  I practiced Dahn Yoga for a year and a half and recently moved to a town that doesn't offer classes. My stress level and brain fog increased after quitting Dahn Yoga.  I started taking traditional yoga classes in my new town and it's not nearly as effective as Dahn Yoga.  I'm no expert but from my experience the Dahn Yoga positions and actions are very effective in decreasing stress and improving quality of life.  I just purchased the dvd (lost the one I bought last year) and I can't wait to get started!  If you have the opportunity to take the classes, they're even better than the dvd because the instructors seem to be well trained and bring a lot of energy to the class.",1351468800,2,777,4.405594405594406
203441,1,1935127268,you will waste your money if you get this dvd its just hitting yourself not more then that so don't buy it,1348444800,,106,3.8636363636363638
203442,5,1935127268,"Great workout video for the beginning Yoga student.  This video is more about the practice of mind, body & spirt.  Also, thank you to the vendor in getting this here on time and in good shape.",1344816000,2,192,4.305555555555555
203443,5,1935127268,"I went to a few classes at a Dahn yoga center a few years ago. I loved it. I could not afford to continue at center due to low income. This DVD was great and helps me to continue on to Greater health in mind body and spirit. I love how it works with all the energy bodies. While I do the body tapping I still recite some of my favorite  mantras, Like I am happy, I am healthy, I am beautiful, I am prosperous.. Would recommend this to everyone.",1340496000,8,444,3.933333333333333
203444,5,1935127268,This video and brain wave vibration have helped with chronic pain in my neck and back. It's also helping me with flexibility and energy. This is wonderful for any level.,1338768000,4,169,4.666666666666667
203445,5,1935127268,This is the best of the Yoga DVDs I have ordered.  It is something I can do easily in the morning or the evening.  I have already noticed a difference in my energy levels.,1323648000,7,171,4.0
7801932,5,1935127268,"Good combination of moves. I also like the fact that each section was divided. If you want to do all of the video, at least you can the portion of it that you like.",1475971200,,164,3.8529411764705883

7801934,5,1935127268,"This video is so very helpful in increasing the body's ability to use energy effectively. With the Dahn Yoga program I released more than 40 pounds of weight. It can be challenging if you have not gotten off the sofa in a while - but even then, you will probably begin to look forward to the movement, as well as the brainwave exercises.",1451260800,,337,4.365079365079365
7801935,5,1935127268,I love this DVD!!! I used to attend Dahn yoga classes but now I don't have a Dahn yoga center in Florida This is a great substitute,1428364800,,131,3.888888888888889
7801936,5,1935127268,"I used to attend Dahn Yoga for 2-3 years in Toronto, but when I moved to US, I could not find classes near my area.  I enjoyed Dahn Yoga very much though my instructors there were mostly Koreans and do not speak English so fluently.  I have come across this DVD and the exercises were coming back to me and I actually understand the technique fully as the instructor speaks English.  Dawn explains very well why it is done and what this type of exercise does for the body.  I am happy I can do this now in my own home.  It takes me two hours long to complete the whole session but that's how long the classes were also when I was attending it in person.  Here, I don't even have to travel.",1428192000,4,689,4.104477611940299

7801941,5,1935127268,"I have had two previous surgeries on my shoulder, and so I am unable to do any kind of conventional yoga. Dahn Yoga is different - no movement that require strength or standing or leaning on the hands or elbows. Very fluid. The DVD is inexpensive, so I suggest anyone considering it should give it a try.",1369872000,2,304,4.350877192982456
