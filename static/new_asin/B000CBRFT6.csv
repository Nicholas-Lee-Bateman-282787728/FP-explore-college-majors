2455286,4,B000CBRFT6,"I enjoyed every second of the novel and was excited to see the adaptation. While I felt a slightly gloomier atmosphere with these ghostly nuns always walking around collecting for charity could have really added to this adaptation, on the whole it was a solid adaptation and solidly acted.

I think with adaptations there is a balance to be struck - too rigid a fidelity to a novel can rob a work of its vitality and its possibility within a very different medium. Yet going overboard in the medium to provide a sensationalistic thrill (as seems to be the case with the latest Marple adaptations) takes away from the novel's original appeal. This adaptation I thought struck a nice balance, with two exceptions:

PLOT SPOILER AHEAD---TURN BACK IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT

1. I felt the liason between Susanna and her cousin a bit far-fetched and completely unnecessary. I'm not a prude, and feel that if it served the work in any way, well, leave it in. But it only becomes a point that Poirot brings out in the end - he already knows who the murderer is, so he comes off as a bit of a sadist, watching this religious woman confess (for no reason at all) her sexual misstep. To me it seemed like there was some need on the part of the script writer to show that even the devout aren't perfect, or everyone has a secret, but it amounted to a waste of screen time. Still it was far less bothersome than my second point:

2. In the novel, the valuable painting turns out to be a Vermeer. In this version, it is a Rembrandt. Why they changed the artist baffles me. The plot actually works better with a Vermeer. I believe at the time that the novel was written, there were a number of Vermeer forgeries in existence. Rembrandt is too easily recognizable an artist, whereas fewer people are familiar with the small collection of Vermeer's in existence.

Also, I believe Christie used Vermeer because he was an artist about whom we know very little - an element of mystery about the painter leaves open the possibility of finding a previously undiscovered work. Moreover, the actual works themselves are rather puzzle like and contemplative - like mini mysteries in and of themselves.

And finally, the use of Vermeer in this adaptation would have been perfect timing given the attention Vermeer has been given in novels and films (i.e. ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring""). It would have been rather timely.

END OF SPOILER

All in all, the film is definitely worth seeing and owning, despite the above mentioned items!  Suchet as Poirot rocks!",1205884800,,2544,4.610619469026549
2455287,3,B000CBRFT6,"I got my item through the link from a marketplace seller.  It's one from an A&E collection with a blue box.  Much to my dismay, when I got the DVD, I find that it's full screen.  I've seen this before on British TV, and it's wide-screen, so I really don't know why they don't just use that to make the DVD.  Anyhow, I love the movie, which is why I'm giving it three stars.  But as a DVD, the product is severely lacking.",1198886400,3,421,4.024096385542169
2455288,4,B000CBRFT6,"I thought that this film deviated from my impression of the book just a little too much. Still, the story was true to the standard Poirot mystery and the cast were all quite believeable, which is frequently a problem when films are made of Christie Mysteries. This is a serious work, although one gets a feeling that the director knew quite well that he was making this one for TV and not for the Cinema. ""The Hollow"" has long been one of my top 10 Christie mysteries and I harbor no specific complaint of this rendering. To pinpoint my review, this film/DVD is very good and a ""must buy"" for anyone who is moderately a Christie enthusiast. I should also add that the cinematography is superior and a pleasure to watch.",1167955200,7,719,4.4961832061068705
2455289,4,B000CBRFT6,"Let me put it this way: This is the only Agatha Christie novel that makes me think I can take a similar premise and do a better job. One given -- I didn't read the original version. But this is my least favorite Poirot adaptation. This is partially due to a sex scene (characters mostly clothed, but still obvious), but I just didn't like this story. Still, the acting was at the usual standard.",1378080000,,395,4.351351351351352

2455291,3,B000CBRFT6,but not one of my favorite Agatha Christie books.  I sometimes put it on the reading list in an author study class for contrast.,1357948800,,128,4.333333333333333
2455292,5,B000CBRFT6,"Agatha Christie's Poirot books are sometimes difficult to follow because of the multiple characters she places in her books, many of whom we dislike because of the little information we get about them in the early parts of the drama, and all of them are possible killers. Another problem is the many red herrings that she inserts. The difficulty is increased in the films where the events and the introduction of characters happen so quickly. The films frequently add a character or two that are not in the book and change events to meet what the film makers feel is cinematic necessity. She usually places a true clue in the book, but it is usually hard to see it; it is like a needle in a haystack of red herrings. These clues are easier to spot in the films because the film makers seem to give these facts an extra second. Yet, it is still not easy to spot. Despite these difficulties, the effort expended in reading or viewing her tale is rewarded by the enjoyment that the reader and viewer get. The enjoyment is increased in the films by the excellent acting by David Suchet as a quirky, idiosyncratic, overly egotistical, but always right (except for only two times), dogmatic searcher for truth.

 In this tale, Poirot is hired to find the murderer of an eccentric woman, the sister of a rich man who had just died.  Everyone knew that the rich man wanted to leave his wealth to a certain young man. Yet when Poirot's friend who hired him, a lawyer, opens the will, he finds that the young man had been disinherited. The dead man was cremated. After the cremation, just before she is killed, the eccentric woman shouts out that he was murdered. Was he murdered and, if so, why? Why was the young man disinherited? Later, a woman who seems to find the answer is hit over the head. What is going on? Who killed the eccentric woman and why?",1320969600,,1846,4.504477611940299
2455293,3,B000CBRFT6,"""After the Funeral"", based on Agatha Christie's 1953 novel of the same name, is a feature-length film first broadcast as part of Series 10 of ITV's ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" in 2006. Poirot is asked by the lawyer Gilbert Entwhistle (Robert Bathurst) to investigate the family of his client, a Mr. Richard Abernethie, who recently died. To his family's surprise, Richard instructed that his estate be sold and the proceeds divided among his 5 living relatives: brother Timothy (Benjamin Whitrow), sister Cora, nieces Rosamund (Fiona Glascott) and Susannah (Lucy Punch), and sister-in-law Helen (Geraldine James). Everyone had expected his fortune to go to George (Michael Fassbender), Richard's favorite nephew. The day after, the eccentric Cora, an artist and collector looked after by her companion Miss Gilcrist (Monica Dolan), is gruesomely murdered in her bed with a hatchet.

As usual, the family members dislike one another. But this is not a story of old family secrets. Poirot is at first consternated, because he believes that every single one of the family lied to him about their whereabouts at the time of Cora's murder. I have to say I saw the solution coming pretty early on, though not the entire scenario. The mystery is interesting enough. As these Poirot mysteries have all been placed in the interwar years, the film does not convey the same sense of post-war pessimism that the book does. Somehow all the characters seem pitiful, as if their lives have greatly deteriorated. But we don't know why. That would have been the War. This is a rare case where moving the mystery to the 1930s causes something to be lost.

There have been some minor changes from the book, which make the characters' behavior more salacious. Salacious is not bad in itself, but this is entirely gratuitous and introduces elements into the plot that serve no purpose. I was particularly put off when Poirot humiliates one of the suspects by forcing her to confess to an indiscretion in front of her family. This is a vicious, pointless thing for Poirot to do and out of character. Poirot has always been a gentleman and protector of innocents. This was the season when writers introduced a bizarre religiosity into the series that gives Poirot a mean streak. ""After the Funeral"" is reasonably entertaining, but superfluous subplots, an ill-tempered Poirot, and a flat ending make it no more than mediocre on the whole.",1320105600,,2414,5.017456359102244
2455294,4,B000CBRFT6,"""The Hollow"", based on Agatha Christie's 1946 novel, is a 90-minute film that originally aired on Britain's ITV in 2004, the last film of Series 9 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"". Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) plans to spend a relaxing weekend in a country cottage. Upon his arrival, he finds that Lady Angkatell (Sarah Miles) has invited him to dinner at The Hollow, her nearby estate. Dining with them are her husband Sir Henry (Edward Hardwicke), son Edward (Jamie de Courcey), cousin Henrietta (Megan Dodds), who is a sculptor, and cousin Gerda (Claire Price) and her philandering physician husband John Christow (Jonathan Cake). And an obnoxious actress, Veronica Cray (Lysette Anthony), former lover of John's, crashes the party looking for a box of matches. The next day, John is found shot to death by the pool, wife Gerda standing over him with a revolver.

This is good cast but not an interesting mystery. Poirot has become more self-righteous and confrontational, but he is still pleasant enough to watch. The local Police Inspector Grange (Tom Georgeson) is on the case, but he's neither interesting nor competent. It's evident that John's death must have something to do with the three women who pine for him: Gerda, Henrietta, and Veronica. He entertains them all. But the story would have done well to have more twists. It only has one, near the end. The red herrings are numerous but not especially convincing. A couple of people seem to be trying to implicate themselves. It's entertaining, but a few more social scenes or Poirot coping with country life would have added some interest.

The acting was o.k. (2 stars for that), but I can't believe the liberties they took with this classic. They changed the names (""Susan"" became ""Susanna""), they omitted characters (""Greg"") or created them at will (Cora's deceased husband) and they changed the relationships completely (""George"" is NOT ""Helen's"" son). They inserted stupid little subplots (the forged will, the stolen Enderby papers and others) that didn't lead anywhere. Many of the actors didn't look at all like described in the book, and Enderby Hall was transformed from a ""vast Victorian house built in the Gothic style"" to some a huge historic country house (Blenheim Palace comes to mind).
If you love Agatha Christie's books as much as I do yourself a favor - skip this less than mediocre adaptation!",1236643200,8,951,4.840490797546012

8096696,5,B000CBRFT6,"Every time I have some down time, I watch Poirot. Why would I suffer commercials and sit there wondering what I am here for when I can simply enjoy the best performance of superb actors? I watched the whole 13 seasons 5 times each at least. After the funeral, though, I watched it at least 10 times. You might argue adaptations, original story line and such... but who cares about that when you have this kind of acting? Every time I watch this, I am blown away by each and every actor's unbelievable interpretation of characters. I didn't even know that Michael Fassbender was in this show but my goodness, what a performance he put on! From the moment his tear drops on cue at the funeral, his eyes steal your focus. The passion, anguish, frustration and sorrow flows down as he speaks, walks and smokes. No wonder he was chosen for Rochester! Of course one cannot stop observing Monica Dolan who ""deservedly received a BAFTA award"" and her out of this world performance. This is the episode that the Great David Suchet was outshined by miles by her. On top of that, we have Fiona Glascott bringing out vanity and insecurity of Rosamund in flesh and blood, with the quiver of her lips. It is like one great competition of actors showcasing their skills and arts and no one is about to lay down and hand over the trophy to others at any point. Camera gently flows and focuses on as if it is aware of this great competition and the music soaks into the story and beautiful acting as the story goes on. There are some stupid movies out there that I regret paying and spending my time, but to me, this is the show that proves the greatness of simple television entertainment.",1451779200,,1673,4.488524590163935

8096698,5,B000CBRFT6,"As with many other viewers, I believe David Suchet is the best of the actors to undertake the role of Poiret. Happily, we have on discs both the short stories and books in which Agatha Christie gave him life. This is one of the so-called 'New"" series which culminated later than this presentation in 'The Final Curtain', the last of Christies Poirot novels, the end of Poirot, and the last of Suchet's portrayal of the character....at least as currently planned. What an achievement by the author of the original books and short stories, what an achievement for the actor, and, let us not forget, what an achievement for the adaptors, producers and directors of the television productions. Oh, yes, three cheers, as well, for the supporting casts which were almost always of  high quality.
This effort does not include Poirot's Dr. Watson, Hastings, played by Hugh Fraser nor Inspector Japp played by Philip Jackson but there is a police inspector to be restrained from too hasty action by the master sleuth. Suchet is, as usual, Poirot  to the hilt, while Sarah Miles, Edward Fox and
Megan Dodds are particularly good in the excellent cast. The story is a tricky one although not, I think, among the best of the adaptations in the series. Nonetheless, for Christie television fans this should be quite enjoyable while others not completely in the grip of the tough guy, research lab or romantic schools in the contemporary media, may find it a pleasant change.",1421625600,,1461,4.863453815261044

What Poirot finds is far more convoluted and sinister. We discover this along with Poirot.

One of the things that make Agatha's writing a tad convoluted is the number of characters that are hard to keep separated in your mind. This movie presentation is starting to approach character overload.  We get the litany, and all the begots.

One fun advantage of watching this presentation is that the camera slows down and ether brackets the important clues or shows Hercule making the iconic ""That is a clue"" face.

In any even if you can second guess the ""who"", the ""why"" will be pretty difficult until one of the final clues near the end.

The film was made in 2005 when some people still had square televisions. Still even with the soft focus it is fun to look at the time period and country side.",1414195200,,1031,4.668508287292818

8096701,4,B000CBRFT6,"I can readily understand why this one received less than stellar reviews. It takes more liberties with the source material than most other Poirot adaptations do, changing some of the characters' relationships and personalities and even eliminating one of the characters entirely. (If, like me, you were eager to see Susan's husband Greg depicted onscreen, prepare yourself for the fact that he doesn't even exist here! Oh, and Susan herself is now Susanna and an entirely different character.)

So why the four stars? Because once I got past my disappointment with the ways in which the movie deviated from the book, I found myself enjoying it to a surprising degree. The basic plot and themes are still intact. As is wonderfully characteristic of this series, we get some memorably sharp dialogue, a few likable characters and moments of sneaky poignancy. The scenery and costumes are typically gorgeous, and David Suchet is masterful as always.

If you don't mind or even find it creatively interesting when Poirot movies differ from the Christie books on which they were based, I'd really recommend checking this one out!",1398211200,,1124,5.103260869565218
