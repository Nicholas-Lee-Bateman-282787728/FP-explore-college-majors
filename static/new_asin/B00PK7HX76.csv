6809158,5,B00PK7HX76,fantastic series! I highly recommend this.,1447027200,2,42,6.166666666666667
6809159,5,B00PK7HX76,"Captivating and never a slow moment in this plot-packed 6-episode biography of one mans memory of life in a small rural English village during WWI. My highest recommendation with one exception:
NO SUBTITLESNO CLOSED CAPTIONS.
Unfortunate with BFS and a sure problem for hearing handicapped. I needed to pause and review often.  But dialects easy to follow, only those with hearing loss will miss this engrossing first-rate performance.

The cast is loaded with seasoned stars, noteworthy displaying believable characters, some you love, some loathe; as intended with the great writing. Plot threads may post-war issues of womens rights, vote, class changes, vet issues, and relationships between neighbors. Some begat love, others spawn hatred. Remember, this is the story British Roaring 20s as seen through the eyes of a young dairymans son, Bert (Tom Varey), as being told decades when he turned 100 (David Ryall). Not idyllic, but touching, poignant.
Cinematography, sets, props, music, all outstanding. Violence, war, brief nudity, and adult situations makes this adult recommended.

Some actors may be newly acclaimed, until Village, but all worth their pluck.
1 ==Berts summer of 1923. His dad, John (John Simm Life on Mars) fights for a better life after losing a soldier son as mother Grace (Maxine Peake Little Dorrit) loses her passivity. Lady Allingham (Juliet Stevenson Emma Politicians Wife) sets the pace to revive the Allingham Estate to old glory, including a hunt chasing a human hare, Bert. The past war altered thoughts on the social class system. Allinghams: Caro (Emily Beecham) adopted illegitimate son is backstory threatening to evolve; George (Augustis Prew Borgias) has PTSD & now married to Martha (Charlie Murphy Philomena), Edmund (Rupert Evans Emma) has a male companion and is running for office as a Conservative. Teacher Gerald (Matt Stokoe) returns. Graces older plump friend Margaret (Annabelle Apsion Doc Martin) is flawless, a shining star in all her scenes.
2 ==Arnold Hankin (Anthony Flanagan) turns a boot factory to The Electric dance hall, questioned by Norma (Ainsley Howard) his wife. Will she attend 1st dance? Bert meets another leftie, Phoebe (Phoebe Dynevor) and grow close. Factory worker Agnes (Chloe Harris) has a problem. Politics ramps up.
3 ==1923 sees Johns dairy TB free and getting on. Agnes finds support and love. Election Day finds women voting. Can teachers, bachelor Gerald and wedded Martha exist under the same school bell? Bill Gibby (Derek Riddell) takes office. Go LABOR!
4 ==Spring 1924 is wedding season, Allington & Hankin claim brides, about much more than lives coming together to quote centenarian Bert. A new affair fans to flame. Bert struggles with his desire to leave the village that Phoebe cleaves. Class becomes a village divide.
5 ==John barely survives the trespass violence but changes others lives and plans in the village forever after. Who will be tried for riot? Allingham family melts down individually and as a group.
6 ==Lady Allingham is scandalized by her world turned topsy-turvy. A reservoir is government proposedon the land that holds the village (Surely this is the major plot for season 3). Caros longing takes her to the brink of life and Harry Bairstow (Joe Armstrong -'Robin Hood') to finally show he has a heart. Martha & Gerald ponder Africa. Meet young Joe, perhaps the coming healer of The Village.
Its a spirited conclusion that causes goose-flesh.

Strongly recommended owning: A major DVD triumph for 2015.",1445126400,5,3515,5.238010657193605

6809165,4,B00PK7HX76,Generally as good as the first series. I think it concentrated to much on one family but that is a personal observation. I wish it had gone more into the rise of the Labor party and social changes after the destruction of a generation in world war 1. Good coverage that PTSD is not a new thing and past generations also suffered and were ignored.  Six episodes were a little short to cover all the changes that happened in the 20's. I hope there will be another series but (spoiler alert) the ending left both a cliffhanger and tied up several story lines so there might not be as much screaming if they don't.,1433721600,14,610,4.350877192982456
