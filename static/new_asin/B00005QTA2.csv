I love her 'girls can do anything men can' attitude. my favorite part is when she meets the prince and tries to steal his horse. it's pretty cool. i didn't love the ending but it was such a good movie that i could overlook it. no one dies (other than the bad guys) but it was still a little anticlimatic and disappointing. watch this movie anyway!",1014940800,3,476,4.3
1648889,5,B00005QTA2,"I have been a fan of Robin Hood ever since I could crawl.  I have written many fiction stories where Robin Hood's daughter came and saved the day.  Now, Disney has fulfilled my dream and the legend is reborn.
With the strength and cunning abilities of her father, and her mother's incredible beauty, Gwyn is the daughter of Robin Hood, the legendary ""prince of theives.""  But instead of practicing archery and swordplay, she is being tutored by Friar Tuck and her best friend, Froderick.  When her father returns home with his close companion, Will Scarlet, Gywn is ready to see her father that she has not seen in five years.  But Robin and Will will not be staying long, for King Richard is dying and they must help his son, Prince Phillip, become king before the evil Prince John is crowned.  To ensure he will be crowned, Prince John issues his guards to kill the prince, whom no one has ever seen.  Gwyn insists on coming along to help, but when her father refuses and rides off one night with Will, Gwyn cuts her beautiful hair and dresses as a boy.  She is not welcome when she arrives in town, but with the help of Froderick she will help her father if it kills her.  But after Robin saves Gwyn from Prince John's guards, he insists that he will accompany her to the church where she is supposed to meet Froderick.  Meanwhile, Prince Phillip's valet has been killed and the guards now know what the prince looks like.  As Phillip is fleeing for France, Prince John's guards put a stop to the church visit by capturing Robin Hood and Will Scarlet, while Froderick and Gwyn are left to fend for themselves.  As Froderick rides back home to ask for assistance, Gwyn stumbles into Prince Phillip, who passes himself off as the valet of the ""deceased"" prince.  Now that the prince has been ""killed,"" and Robin Hood and Will Scarlet have been sentenced to death, it is up to the ""Princess of Thieves"" to save the day.  But with no experinece against her father's archenemies, is Gwyn up to the challenge?",1013299200,11,2006,4.536111111111111
1648890,5,B00005QTA2,"This is a great adventure story about a fictious daughter of Robin Hood & Maid Marian named Gwen, set at the time of King Richard's death. King Richard's son & heir is a son in France, and his claim to the throne is being challenged by the familar villians, Prince John & the Sheriff of Nottingham. Robin Hood is called upon to help bring the young Prince Phillip to England, and daughter Gwen wants to come along. He refuses to allow her of course but she cuts her hair, dresses as a boy & follows along anyway. Though cunning & skillful she manages to cause as much trouble as she does help, including landing her famous father in jail.
  You'll have to watch the movie for yourself to see how it ends, but be prepared for a refreshing time of old fashioned adventure & chilvary without the language & bloody violence that is standard fare for today's ""family"" videos. The rating was PG but it is a very mild PG. Light-hearted, good family viewing for all ages but especially the pre-teen & up group. Preschoolers & younger elementary children will most likely be too young to fully understand the story line, but may still enjoy the battle scenes. And it includes a romantic twist for those who enjoy that. The movie ends with a brief but very interesting historical dialogue about the real Prince Phillip, son of King Richard the Lionhearted, and his reign. Interesting note: lead role is played by an actress from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  Star Wars buffs will enjoy trying to figure out which one of the Queen's handmaidens is now the Princess of Thieves.",1009756800,8,1567,4.589285714285714

1648957,5,B00005QTA2,"This is an amazingly good story.  Anyone who collects Robin Hood movies, as I do, will be happy to view (and own) a copy of this film. Keira Knightley is very believable as Robin Hood's daughter, and (not to burst your bubble) was fifteen years old when this movie was produced (2001).  It's sort of weird to admit it, but I did not want this story to end; it's that good.
By the way, if you have taken time to read this brief review of ""Princess of Thieves, may I say that the best Robin Hood movie (of the more recent generation) is the Kevin Costner version in ""Prince of Thieves"" (1997).

1648978,5,B00005QTA2,"Before she became a full-blown star, and all that entails, Kiera Knightley starred in this movie written from the perspective of Robin Hood's daughter, struggling to prove to her father she is more than a mere girl. Clever, full of action, with a dusting of romance, it's a strong story that's well-acted and foreshadows Knightley's talents and future. - Author Claudia Newcorn",1388016000,2,377,5.096774193548387

1648996,3,B00005QTA2,"Long before the ' Hunger Games ' Katniss became a heroine with bow & arrow expertise,
Keira Knightley played such a heroine. First in the 2001 ABC-Disney for-television film, 'Princess of Thieves' (filmed in Romania), & later in the vastley superior,
under-marketed, 2004 'King Arthur' (Clive Owen), as the celtic (or, woad) Guinevere.

Adding to the legend of Robin Hood, Keira (astonishingly aged 15) plays Gwyn, the out-spoken daughter of the aged outlaw (Stewart Wilson, 'Zorro'). There is a rift between the two regarding her father's absences, his over-protection of his daughter, & Gwyn's determination to join in the fight against the Sheriff of Nottingman's (Malcolm McDowell) & Prince John's (Jonathan Hyde) ruthlessness. Two of Robin's loyal supporters, Will Scarlett (Crispin Letts) & Friar Tuck, see the dedication & talent that Gwyn reveals, & offer their support, along with longtime friend, now lovestruck, Froderick (Del Synnott).

Gwyn, with Robin's band, joins the fight to free her captured father from the Tower of London before Prince John is crowned, & to protect the recently freed-from-exile Prince Phillip (Stephen Moyer) so that he, instead, can be king (A limited romance entails Phillip & Gwyn). Her father finally comes around to allowing his daughter to join his quest against tyranny.

The film itself is more narrative than action, & Keira shows her bow skills in few instances: during a chase in the forest, the Sheriff-sanctioned contest, & a quick
standoff moment with the Sheriff.

At the film's end, it states that 'history has forgotten' some instances which didn't
turn out as presented.

Keira, herself, is astonishing in her young beauty, maturity, naturalness & believability
(Even the director mentioned that Keira has a bright future as a phenomenal actress).

My only complaint is the video transfer on my DVD. The colors lean toward yellow, &
slightly washed out, with a bit too much contrast. Still, I did find myself caught
up in the unique story, and the amazing young Keira Knightley.",1369526400,2,2035,5.207951070336391

1648998,1,B00005QTA2,"""Disney is incapable of creating a strong female protagonist -- they're completely [screwed up]!"" my wife exploded as the credits finally rolled. Her analysis is sound, her judgment correct. Moreover, this ""adventure"" film is hijacked by a romance subplot that metastasizes. The movie lacks pacing and generally drags itself along like a gutshot bear.
As far as fun for the whole family, reducing independent heroines to subservient roles is no fun. Our four year old daughter was bored, and quite reasonably wanted to watch Xena instead -- along with Ripley from Aliens, about the only female action hero/role model out there. (Sadly, she will of course have to wait several years to watch Aliens.)",1361145600,5,699,5.140350877192983

It's free of excessive violence and profanity, making it great for kids! And it has a nice amount of action, making it exciting for the boys. The end has an interesting twist (no I'm not telling!) that isn't exactly expected. Nonetheless, it's a great film that I would recommend to anyone.",1334534400,,416,4.635135135135135
1649010,4,B00005QTA2,"Tales have long been told of the noble thief Robin Hood and his love for Maid Marion... but few know of the child that was given them. The importance of an heir is vast, and Prince John orders the sheriff to place a bounty on the child's head at its birth double to that of the father. But when the Sheriff of Nottingham learns that the child is a girl, the bounty is dropped... and Gwen is forgotten.

Raised in the monastery of Fryer Tuck, Gwen (Keira Knightley) is a strong-willed young woman with very black and white views of the world. Largely ignored by her father (Stuart Wilson) due to her gender, her only companionship is found in the young novice Froderick. But even his sweet temperament and eager-to-please mentality cannot repair her grievous relationship with Robin Hood. The daring outlaw is in Jerusalem, fighting with King Richard. But when a war wound leaves the king close to death, Robin must return and see his illegitimate son Philip (Stephen Moyer) to the throne... before the King's tyrannical brother Prince John (Jonathan Hyde) is crowned. Her patriotism running strong, mingled with desperation to appear in her father's eyes worthy, Gwen pleads with him to allow her to accompany the Merry Men on this quest. But Robin is adamant that it is no place for a young woman, and sets out the following day, leaving a sullen daughter behind. In the meantime, Prince John has sent out an order that Philip is not to arrive in England alive and the prince's valet is mistakenly murdered. Philip is alone and lost in England. And Gwen is determined to impress her father... even if she must masquerade as a young man to do it. Eventually their paths will collide and it will be up to Gwen to see the young man upon the throne... and to save her father from death.

Overly predictable, Princess of Thieves is at most an entertaining check-your-brain-at-the-door flick perfect for teenagers seeking an alternative to the male-dominated world of Robin Hood. Gwen is a lot of fun, from her spirited verbal tousles with anyone willing to debate to her obviously incredible archery skills and her kind heart. Froderick is at times funny... and in other instances, cringingly immature. And Philip? Well, Philip is the expected ""Please don't crown me"" monarch who would much rather live a simple life. As everyone knows she will, Gwen talks him into the job by pointing out how terribly the people have been treated under Prince John's reign. Thus said, although the film is a nice little production with reasonably good values and a couple of attached moral lessons, there is nothing very original. The script writers pretty much borrowed off the Robin Hood plight that's been seen and done before... the archery tournament... the evil Sheriff... the tyrannical Prince John... And the Philip-Gwen struggle is pretty much the Prince Henry-Danielle debate from Ever After : a selfish, spoiled monarch who is brought around by a poor but sensible young woman. Really the only originality is the untypical ending that closes on a bittersweet note.

The acting is praiseworthy although I had a bit of difficulty accepting Stuart Wilson as Robin Hood. He's a very amiable actor and is by far the best in the slew of embarrassingly-bad swordfighters in the film. The only truly great actress in the bunch is young Kiera Knightley herself. Yes, it's predictable and it wouldn't have held up in a run at the box office, but it is an entertaining and almost-innocent way to spend two hours if you like a good adventure, a bit of romance, and a girl that lets it be known that gender has nothing to do with talent or ability. This is one Princess that stands on her own two feet.",1332892800,,3681,4.757433489827856
1649011,3,B00005QTA2,"Gwen, (Kiera Knightley) Robin Hood's (Stuart Wilson) daughter lost her mother as a young child, and has seen her father only a handful of times because he has been on Crusade most of her life. When he returns on the death of King Richard she believes he will finally stay for good and they will be a proper family.
Robin however had been entrusted with a special mission by King Richard, to ensure that his illegitimate son and heir Philip (Stephen Moyer) becomes King instead of dastardly John (Johnathon Hyde) who will go to any lengths to take the throne. This mission takes him away from home once again. This arouses the jealousy of Gwen who is determined to go with her father to prove herself, and make him feel guilty about leaving her behind because she is a girl.
Things to not go according to plan however when Robin's Nemesis the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm MacDowell) takes him hostage to stop him from foiling Prince John's sinister plans to sieze the throne, leaving Gwen with the responsibility of rescuing him, defeating the evil Sheriff and his henchmen and ensuring Philip takes his rightful place on the throne of England.

Originally a TV movie for Disney Channel this is yet another Robin Hood 'spin off', it has a better (and unusually almost entirely British ) cast most other such productions, though this is because Disney of course has more money at their disposal.

Prince John is as usual an incompetent childish fool, but his acting is as bad as his persona, and is matched by all the other baddies with the exception of The Sheriff of Nottingham. For some bizarre reason the British actor in the role of Will Scarlet has a very unrealistic Scottish accent throughout. I can understand this from an American actor who cannot do a British accent, but why from a Brit?

All the characters (including the peasants) have perfectly clean clothes throughout, never get dirty, and look immaculate all the time even when they are in the forest.
One character jumps in front of an archer to 'take and arrow' for Prince Philip in the style of an action movie, but recovers after 5 minutes.
The film makers seemed also to have little knowledge of the Geography of Britain, as characters are able to travel the 125 Miles from Nottingham to London in a couple of hours with what must have been incredibly fast horses. As another reiviewer mentioned, Gwen is called a 'commoner' but should not be because according to traditional interpretations of the Legends both her parents were of noble blood.

It is very corny and predictable, with the typical resolution of Robin nearly being killed by the Sheriff but being saved by the good guys just in time. Still, such is to be expected from a children's film.
This one has something to please most children up to about the age of about 11 with a good looking hero and heroine, a `kickass' girl in the leading role, plenty of action including sword-fighting and archery, deeds of daring doo, all the familiar 'Robin Hood' characters and a happy ending.
My only concern would be that somechildren who didn't know that much about History might end up believing that King Richard's son Philip really did become King of England. This is probably not very likely though.

Some have commented that the main problem with this movie is that is a TV movie that tries to be a Big Screen movie, but fails. I am inclined to agree. It is slightly better than the average Children's TV movie, and has been released on DVD everywhere from Australia to Korea and Hungary but for some reason bypassed the UK.",1324684800,,3556,4.6923076923076925

1649013,2,B00005QTA2,"This movie looked interesting on first sight- being the fan of Robin Hood and the Middle Ages that I am- but I was disappointed to find that it was completely predictable and oh so cheezy.  For example, the first conflict of the story is how Robin Hood is gone all the time on the crusades, and his daughter is mad that he won't take her with him.  They start yelling at each other, and in the end Gwyn decides to disobey him anyway.  Sounding a bit familiar?  This whole parent-child disobedience theme is getting so old in Disney movies (Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Lion King, e.t.c.) and it just isn't a good lesson for kids to be learning.  Now I'll move on to the cheese.  This film does a lousy job of depicting the Middle Ages, and some scenes are just so unrealistic they made me laugh out loud.  For example, Prince John and company ride into battle with their hair looking like its been freshly curled!  And besides all the cheese and predictable-ness, I hated the character of Robin Hood.  The original books describe him as a jolly guy who can be serious but has a never-dying sense of humor. In the movie, he is depicted as a gruff, stern, and uncaring old father.  That was really disappointing.  If you want a better Robin Hood story, read the original book by Howard Pyle, watch the movie with Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, or relive the Disney cartoon.  I assure you, any of those choices will be better than dragging through this cheezy, predictable movie.",1307923200,2,1480,4.5643939393939394

If you can get past the basic plot, it is a pretty good movie. If you are like I am, and a huge fan of Keira Knightley, it is definitely worth seeing. Like all of her movies, she does an outstanding job of creating a believable character. Stephen Moyer plays the predictable persecuted prince who must be saved by Keira and her band of Sherwood Forest people. Forget all of that, and just enjoy watching Knightley.

1649046,3,B00005QTA2,"I missed this movie when it first appeared on DVD/video but out of curiosity have gone back and watched it.  Overall, it's a mediocre production, but what stands out is the dynamic performance of the then mostly unknown Keira Knightley, which foreshadows what she would do in her subsequent star-making roles.  In his rave review of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Washington Post critic Stephen Hunter described Knightley as a ""lioness"" and ""a force of nature,"" and, though they're not as refined here, she brings those same qualities to ""Princess of Thieves"" to such an extent that at times some of the other actors look like they're afraid of her.  In other words, there's plenty here for the controversial actress' fans to love and for her detractors to hate.

Also notable, is that Knightley's character Gwyn proves to be a ""brave dame"" by nearly all the criteria put forward by novelist and media critic  Susan Isaacs, including how she handles love and relationships.  This  leads to the refreshingly unconventional, un-Disney ending that some other reviewers here have commented upon.",1208563200,2,1083,5.084745762711864

1649079,4,B00005QTA2,"In 2001, Disney produced PRINCESS OF THIEVES, a made-for-television movie which not only dusted off the legend of Robin Hood but engagingly added to it. It featured the lovely Keira Knightley, who was then only 15 years old and took time off from school to shoot this picture. The following year would cause her star to prominently ascend with the release of BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, but, even as early as in this film, one can plainly see the natural acting abilities and vivaciousness which radiated from this lanky snippet of a girl.

Plot SPOILERS begin:

The year is 1184 in the reign of Richard the Lionheart, King of England. The Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) decides to rescind the price put on the head of Robin Hood's baby upon discovery that the infant is a girl. The Sheriff will grow to rue this act. The willful and plucky Gwyn (Keira Knightley), despite the determinedly sheltered existence her celebrated father had laid out for her, is not about to lead a life of meek and ladylike propriety as she instead seeks to follow in her father's footsteps. Possessing her father's archery skills and his habit of questioning wrongful authority, Gwyn will end up in more capers than one girl really should.

Now it's been five years since Gwyn has seen her father. Robin loves his daughter and, for the sake of her safety, has purposely made his visits unpredictable and very seldom. One day, Robin Hood and Will Scarlett are tasked to safely escort the dying King Richard's son, Prince Philip, so that the prince may properly assume the monarchy. En route, Robin Hood pays a call on Gwyn, who has long been left in the care of Friar Tuck at his abbey and reared with her childhood friend and monastery novice Froderick.

But an argument forms a barrier between Gwyn and her father (she wants to go with him, he thinks that's just stupid), which makes for a bitter departure for Robin. The undaunted Gwyn cuts her hair to pass for a boy (hah!) and sneaks away in pursuit of her father and her own very high ideals. When Robin Hood is taken captive by the Sheriff of Nottingham, it's suddenly left up to his rebellioius daughter to rescue him and prevent the wicked Prince John from usurping the throne of England. And, wouldn't you know it, an archery tournament figures into the rescue mission. Good thing the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

Plot SPOILERS end.

PRINCESS OF THIEVES is very good for a television feature. The focus is definitely on Gwyn, the daughter of Robin Hood, with a solid supporting role played by Robin Hood even if fans might be a bit disappointed that he doesn't get to do more; a minor beef of mine is that, even though Gwyn has seemingly taken on the mantle of the sharpshooter in this film, I still expected Robin to wield the bow and arrow more (in fact, I find it hard to recall even one scene in which he slings a bow). Also, in much of the movie, Robin is stern and lacking in humor and seems intent on playing the uncompromising father card. Only later on do glimmerings of his once rakish personality surface.

Now, sure, this movie's hampered by a very modest budget, which played a huge factor in having the film shot on location in affordable Romania. It's a given that the special effects, stunts, and sets would suffer a bit. But while there is a diminished sense of grandeur here and the skirmishes are done up with more enthusiasm than technical skill, there's still a sense of purpose to this film. The cast and crew, it seems to me, were fully behind this picture and I could sense the commitment in their performances (the behind-the-scenes featurette goes on to reveal that, of the entire cast and crew, only about 16 or 17 spoke English; so bonding was key).

Stuart Wilson, with his commanding presence and sketchy resemblance to an older Sean Connery (who himself portrayed this character), makes a fine Robin Hood, who's now more grizzled and may have lost a bit of his dash but remains heroic and can still muster up an irreverent comment when called upon (""You have egg in your beard""). Even at his most stodgy, he maintains a certain magnetic quality about him. Stephen Moyer provides romantic lead services and is decent as the initially self-serving Prince Philip; certainly, he calls on his Heath Ledger good looks to win over the hearts of the female viewing audience.  Veteran actors Malcolm McDowell and Jonathan Hyde add villainous heft to their respective roles of the Sheriff of Notthingham and Prince John. And Keira Knightley? Well, she's simply luminous and one can see why things got bigger and better for her soon after, career wise. As the feisty Gwyn - who'll brazenly steal a horse but who then is insulted when the horse is offered to her because of her gender - Keira embodies modern girl empowerment to a tee. Boy, whenever she's on the screen, I can't take my eyes off her. Plus she has that sexy-cool Brit accent.

This dvd contains two noteworthy bonus features: ""Princess of Thieves: The Adventure Behind the Adventure,"" which is the 8 and a half minutes long, behind-the-scenes segment and a so-so audio commentary by Director Peter Hewitt. These extras are certainly miniscule but apropos of a small screen feature. But it's not about the extras, it's about the film itself. Never mind the historical discrepancies. Watch this instead for the entertainment value. PRINCESS OF THIEVES effectively pays homage to the Outlaw of Sherwood, one of the all-time great historical legends. The climactic scenes may not be as rousing as or contain the magnitude of Errol Flynn's or even Kevin Costner's versions, but they'll certainly do. With ample servings of derring-do, false identities, royal intrigue, and star power as provided by Knightley, PRINCESS OF THIEVES is a breath of fresh air and an appealing addition to the mythos of Robin Hood. Once again, Keira Knightley rocks.

One question, though. Where's Little John in all this?",1174089600,6,5933,4.750485436893204

1649081,4,B00005QTA2,"I stumbled across this delightful treat of a Disney film a few years ago, just as Kiera Knightley was breaking onto the Hollywood scene in ""Bend It Like Beckham""...

A family-friendly film, this fictional story ""Princess of Thieves"" centers on Robin Hood's almost-grown teenage daughter, Gwyn (Kiera Knightley).  While King Richard lies dying (off at the crusades), his illegitimate son (& rightful heir), Prince Phillip (Stephen Moyer) must bravely face danger & the mercenaries hired by Prince John (Richard's evil brother) to travel across England & ascend the throne. The tempestuous father/daughter relationship between Robin Hood & Gwyn must be overcome (Gwyn is angry with her father, as he is gone all the time & won't let her join his band of merry men), in order that they might help Phillip to his rightful place as ruler, foiling the plans of the evil Prince John. But when Phillip & Gwyn meet by chance under false circumstances, anthing & everything could happen...

For those of you worried about content, this is a very family-friendly movie: there is some mild romantic tension & a time when a woman dressed as a man ends up atop another man for a few seconds (clothes on, they were fighting), there is some killing/death (nothing too drastic or bloody shown) and there is mild violence as people fight.  Beyond this, there is little to object to...

I was quite impressed by this film: I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the fictional nature of the story and cheese factor, but I must say I really did like this movie & have watched it quite a few times: a sweet, sweet story with some good actors/actresses, I would recommend this as a nice break from everyday fare & a good film for the whole family to watch!",1153440000,34,1725,4.698675496688741
1649082,4,B00005QTA2,"This movie is a favorite of my daughter and I.  I like the main imaginative idea of Robin Hood as a single father, bringing up a daughter named Gwyn.  Talk about the ultimate tom boy, right? Well she happens to also be a very beautiful girl and the mix of modern and historical sensibilities about gender and the roles we play sets the stage for philosophical reflection, action and discussions.

  The positive aspects of this film begins with the location of the filming.  Listening to the commentary points out many interesting facts about Romania and filming in general.  There is a very excellent film sequence near the beginning showing progressive growth of Gwyn as she awakes in the morning over an approximate 10 year period. For Star Trek fans there is a very funny little aside where the director refers to 2 of his characters as looking like Klingons and they really do.  Keira Knightley is superb in this film.  I believe that this film role will one day be seen as a classic for it embodies everything she potentially brings to the screen, but does so in a very family friendly story.  I really like this actress, but don't care to follow her harder edged characterizations in some other films.  I realize my conservative opinion on this and respect her right to pursue her career as she sees fit.  The horses are fantastic.  You learn from the commentary that they had difficulty with the wild natured Romanian horses and it is fun to see evidence of this on screen.  Look for the roving dogs also.

  The negative qualities of this film are mostly humorous.  The fight sequences are very tame, which is good for a family film.  Keira is never physically convincing as a ""boy"", but all films require some amount of imaginative play.  Jonathan Hyde's acting, while good, is a rip off of Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham in 1991's Prince of Thieves. The ending is very sad from a romantic standpoint, even though I understand its historicity.  Royal restrictions on marriage are so stupid, as well as restrictions of some church groups on marriage in the clergy.  But, I digress.

  Overall this is a fun, engaging movie that entertains and makes you think.  The primary story revolves around the father/daughter relationship and this movie succeeds in promoting positive dialogue and action if you find yourself in one.  When you understand this it makes this movie's ending a very happy beginning.  Enjoy!",1128902400,11,2424,4.7898550724637685
1649083,4,B00005QTA2,"Keira Knightley can bring integrity to any movie, but she especially does so here in this sweet, entertaining flick. She's a shining star on the rise.

I'm not usually a big fan of Disney productions but I really liked this, since it was not your typical Disney flick. It was very entertaining and lavishly filmed, set in some absolutely spectacular locations, and starred some really top-notch actors. There were funny moments, sad moments and moments of high action, all nicely interspersed. The only thing I found a tad disappointing was the big fight scene towards the end, since it was a little bit tame and slow, but I accept that because this is a family movie, they couldn't really embrace full-on violence.

I was more than satisfied with the slightly non-conventional (for Disney) ending...it ended the way it should, in a somewhat non-predictable way. And I loved the prince, too...he was very charming!

Even though this is a family movie, it's intelligently enough written to appeal to mature adults as well, particularly fans of medieval and adventure films.",1122595200,9,1072,5.01123595505618

Marian has died and left her husband to raise their daughter. Since he is often gone off to fight for King Richard, it reminds us of single parents raising children today. A tough job that often ends up with some resentment on the part of the child for not being there for them. Sound familiar?

Even still the acting is decent and the production values are good. A relatively light adventure film that the family can enjoy. A romance develops between Gwen and Prince Phillip as he tries to hide from Prince John and the Sheriff of Notingham. Good quality DVD but no extras. Fans of family oriented Disney movies should enjoy it.",1115164800,12,750,4.555555555555555

This movie (originally made for television) is actually well worth a look and really not all that bad if taken for what it is (a fantasy re-imagining of the what if the good hearted English outlaw Robin Hood had a daughter who followed in her fathers footsteps). With some great acting - especially from Malcolm McDowell as the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham and rising Hollywood star Keira (King Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean) Knightley as the title character Gwyn.
Revolving around the attempts of Robin Hood (and subsequently Gwyn) to safely transport King Richards illegitimate son Phillip to London in an effort to thwart Prince John's designs on the English throne.

With many plot twists it holds your attention but the ending you can predict.  Keira Knightley, in her first of her many outstanding performances is an absolute joy to watch.

1649109,4,B00005QTA2,"This is a really good movie with lots of action and some romance thrown in as well.  Gwen, the neglected daughter of Robin Hood, decides to prove to her father that she can help him in his quest against Prince John.  The King is dying and Robin is trying to make sure the rightful heir, Philip, the illegitimate son of King Richard, is placed on the throne.  Gwen cuts her hair and pretends to be a boy.  This is the only part of the movie that is somewhat unbelievable because she is a beautiful young woman that could never be mistaken for a boy, hair or no hair, lol.  Keira Knightley (Gwen) is just outstanding in this film, and seems older than her 15 years!  Stephen Moyer, is also stunning and does an excellent job in his role as the prince.  One of the most memorable performances is by Del Synnott as Gwen's best-friend Froderick.  Gwen meets Philip and he tells her he is Conrad, the Prince's valet, and that Prince Philip is dead.  Little does she know that he is the prince himself!  I didn't give this movie the highest rating because the conclusion is somewhat disappointing for someone like me who is such a die-hard romantic.  Get the kleenexes!  The story is more about Gwen's relationship with her father, and her desire to share his occupation of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, even though she is not a son.  It's an interesting movie with good acting, and is a good movie for the whole family. If you want all the romantic loose ends tied up nicely though, I'd suggest you watch a movie such as Ever After instead.  The soundtrack of this movie is beautiful.  I also liked the creative way that they aged Gwen from a small child to a woman at the beginning of the film.",1086998400,3,1706,4.388535031847134
1649110,2,B00005QTA2,"The only interesting thing anyone can note about ""Princess of Thieves"" is the filmmakers savvy in casting soon-to-be famous Keira Knightley in the lead role. God knows, she's stunningly beautiful, oozing star quality from every pore (not unlike an early Julia Roberts) and shown here at only 15, she has a lot of poise and screen presence.
But this is the kind of children's film -- presumably made FOR girls -- that I absolutely detested as a child, and I think most pre-teen and adolescent girls would ultimately feel the same way. It sets up a scenario where you THINK you are going to see a high-spirited and adventuresome girl actually getting to ride horses/shoot arrows/fight etc....but what you actually end up with is a super-pretty model-type actress who wears mascara and lip gloss in Sherwood Forest, has a perfect fashion model figure and doesn't actually get to do much in the way of action. Much of the movie's action scenes (and plot) surround Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) or other characters. The thrust of the plot surrounds not Gwyn's own adventures, but her desire to be with her mostly absentee Dad. Very wholesome, but not very interesting.
Obviously this was made for TV or cable and it has a painfully low budget look, with most of the movie shot in close ups (eliminating the need for much in the way of extras or sets). The quality and staging of the fight scenes and archery is especially lame and unprofessional looking. But the lameness is evident in other ways that are really unnecessary, even from a $$ point of view: such as when Gwyn decides to disguise herself as a boy, she has to cut her hair. It appears that Ms. Knightley's own hair at this point was cut in a chin-length bob. So when her character first appears with long hair, we can assume it's hair extensions...therefore, it shouldn't pose any problem to actually SHOW her cutting her (fake) hair! But the director skips this pivotal scene (showing the character transforming from girl to ""boy"") and just lets us see the strands of hair hitting the floor.
I feel a bit mean-spirited picking on a movie so obviously simple and low budget, as they obviously didn't have a lot of resources to work with. But there is a real need for adventure films for girls, and this is just so bland, disappointing, and utterly without personality or viewpoint.
Only worthwhile for die-hard Keira Knightley fans, who'd like an early look at her, pre-fame.",1084752000,8,2430,4.747044917257683

While her father is away, this ""princess"" is busy learning the arts of the forest and following in her fathers foot steps more than she might like to admit.
This is a pretty clean film.  There are no language concerns to think of.  Gwyn has a friend that has a special crush on her.  He's more like a brother , but dreams that Gwyn might somehow see him for more than he is.  Gwyn and Phillip develop a love interest, but there is nothing distasteful about their relationship.
The movie offers some very good discussion points and lessons on honor, respect, loyalty, friendship, and obedience.  In the end, good prevails and the loving relationship between father and daughter is restored and made stronger.

Robin was Robin of Lockesly and Robin's father was Lord of Lockesly therefore making Robin Hood also a Lord.  This would make Gwen of sufficient birthright to marry the prince or should I say king.  Therefore the fact that they didn't marry would be totally incorect because there would be nothing to stop them from marrying and might I say that the commoners would probably approve of her above anyone else therefore making everyone happy.

The never before heard from, Gwyn, is very well played and the story is entirely enjoyable; however, the sword play is unconvincing to say the least.
A good tale, with a historically questionable theme, but it's Robin Hood-esque so there aren't a lot on constraints.  I would have liked a different ending, but the one portrayed probably comes closer to what the ethics and constraints of times would have actually supported.",1020124800,2,638,4.87962962962963

Without giving it away this movie's love ""interest"" ultimately has to do with the love between a father and daughter. There is a romantic interest in the film/story that is beautifully done - but it is the relationship between Robin Hood and his daughter Gwyn, the Princess of Thieves, that is the real beautiful ending to this delightful and very well done movie. Enjoy!",1017792000,6,528,4.75
