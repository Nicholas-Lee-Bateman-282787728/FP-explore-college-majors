904394,4,6304606230,"Some are ugly, some are attractive; some use drugs, some do not; some are stupid, some are average, some are smart.  And all of them are teenage male prostitutes working the streets of Prague.  Their clients consist largely of German, Swiss, and Dutch tourists in search of cheap sex--and for additional income they make pornos on the side.  And along the way they are ripped off, abused, and degraded until they simply wear out.
Wiktor Grodecki's documentary BODY WITHOUT SOUL is a dark and disturbing look at life on the streets of Prague.  The film consists of interviews with a dozen or so teenagers describing how they first began on the streets, how they drifted into prostitution and pornography.  Some of the subjects seemed drugged; others are surprisingly articulate.  The centerpiece of the film, however, is an extended interview with a pornographic film director who at first attempts to gloss over the unsavory aspects of his work--and who ends by unintentionally revealing just how vicious he actually is.  The pornographer is also a pathologist, and the camera follows him into the autopsy room and films him at work.  Grodecki then intercuts these scenes with scenes of him directing his latest film, thus making the point that these boys are no more to those who use them than so much meat.
Although it is exceptionally well done, I would hesitate to recommend BODY WITHOUT SOUL to a casual viewer.  It is a moving film, a powerful testament re the old, old story of man's inhumanity to man... But many will find the autopsy scenes repulsive beyond their toleration, and I cannot imagine that many will watch the film more than once.  Recommended, but as a rental rather than a purchase.",1032393600,38,1705,4.868512110726644
904395,5,6304606230,"One of the most truly despairing documentaries ever filmed, this film chronicles the cruel exploitation and empty lives of Eastern European teenage hustlers. The boys are allowed to simply speak to the camera, and their stories are harrowing and unflinching. Their narratives are intercut with an astonishingly frank interview with a director of teen porn films, who eagerly recounts his abusive methods for soliciting performances while carving up cadavers in his part-time job as coroner. The documentary has a very cool feel to it... it's a gritty, unemotional glimpse at this slice of life. White-on-white subtitles are somewhat difficult to read, and music is slightly intrusive.",1026864000,20,684,5.462264150943396
904396,4,6304606230,"This is one of the most harrowing films I've ever seen about the issue of teenage boy prostitution, though not as affecting as the director's next film, Mandragora. As one who knows Prague well, I can say that the situation is quite realistic, as long as one keeps in mind that the director is dealing with boys at the very lowest end of the prostitution spectrum and therefore those most prone to abuse. The heart of the film is the  interview with the Czech porn film director, a true descent into evil that chills one to the bone. One of the boys interviewed in the film made it into the director's Mandragora in a starring role. He made quite an impression as an actor and was widely praised in the Czech press, so let us hope he has continued in his acting career. The Czech press was quite harsh in its evaluation of all the films of this director dealing with boy prostition in Prague, accusing him of sensationalism and gratuitious nudity, an ironic criticism for films  dealing with sex exploitation. Nonetheless, the film is a landmark study of the terrible risks faced by young, poor teenage boys entering the sex trade in Prague.",987465600,27,1141,4.588235294117647
904397,2,6304606230,"I was fairly disappointed. The central character, a porn-film director was somewhat self opinionated and irritating. Listening to him was not helped by having to read the English sub-titles.  There are some rather cute Czech lads to look at, and you can sympathise with their (albeit self-induced) plight. Anyone looking for much nudity and sex however, will be disappointed.
The film is more of a 'Talking Heads' Documentary, with very little action. There is a strange (and repellent) inclusion in the film, of what appears to be a very real post-mortem (the directors daytime occupation is a mortician ).
The DVD will probably gather a little dust on the shelf, as it's not particularly re-watchable.",978652800,13,703,5.113043478260869

904506,5,6304606230,"I consider myself a fairly harsh reviewer, but I found ""Body Without Soul"" amazing.  One of the foremost reasons is that it is edited so well, juxtaposing scenes of a police coroner dissecting a corpse while having that same coroner alternating as a director of homosexual pornography.  Another fascinating aspect is the coroner/director speaking in alternating voices; he openly contradicts himself numerous times and yet is utterly unaware of the paradox.

""Body Without Soul"" runs the gamut thematically from conversations on AIDS to discussions concerning death.  Wiktor Grodecki offers up psychological portraits of young men and the older men who exploit them; if you're searching for a porn film, look elsewhere;",1456963200,,719,5.45045045045045

904704,3,6304606230,"This is a documentary look at teen aged male prostitutes in Prague. The ones interviewed range in age from 15 to 18, but some mentioned are as young as eleven. About the first hour of the film is interviews with the boys. The boys are straight forward about what they do, how they started etc. but do not get overly graphic about it. For about the next thirty minutes the documentary moves to the home of Pavel Rousek who uses the prostitutes to make gay porno videos, primarily for German distribution. This section is a little more graphic about what the boys do for the videos, and part of this documentary film shows Pavel filming a porno video. While the boys are seen nude in this section of the film, none of the porno scenes are shown. This section of the film inter cuts the filming of the porno videos with an interview of Pavel which was made at the morgue where he works. Part of this interview was made while he was doing an autopsy of an adult male. The body is seen from time to time across the bottom of the screen and he describes what he is doing in the autopsy along with lifting organs up into full view of the camera while also discussing the making of the porno videos. In the last few minutes of the film the boys discuss the difference between body and soul (which is where the film gets its name) and death.

The atmosphere presented here is quite heavy, pessimistic, pich black. While watching it I couldn't stop thinking that these boys are lost. I was also shocked by their attitude towards HIV/AIDS...That they are careless is way too delicate to say.
There is one person who makes this movie even more depressing. It is the evil porn ""direcor"" who talks without any shame about his work, how he abuses those boys etc.
But these were the scenes shot in the morgue that I found as very very disturbing. Even if W.Grodecki wanted to emphasize some matters, this part of the film is really sick.

Best of all was some urgent drumming which had a slightly Japanese feel to it. Sexually charged,and very appropriate.
As for the boys themselves,the director has made some canny choices. A number of them would make brillant filmstars.....there's a certain poignant/artistic look about a them. I hope they manage to get out of their irregular line of work as a result of this exposure.
The bad guy is a man called Pavel Rousek who directs porn movies. Not a likeable chap but he's commendably frank about his exploits:He admits to punching a boy and says you can see the bruise mark in one of his movies.

904782,5,6304606230,"Wiktor Grodecki is a brave filmmaker, one who is unafraid to address a controversial subject, yet one who is able to make a powerful sociologic statement by creating a metaphorical art film that demands respect.

Grodecki interviews young boys (ages 14 - 17) who are male hustlers in Prague: he wisely removes (for the most part) the interviewer questions allowing the individual boys to make spontaneous, searing comments.  These young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes, how they deal with selling their bodies, where they find their business (the train station, the swimming pools, etc), how they feel about the johns and about their fellow hustlers, the manner in which they do business including the way in which the financial aspects come to play - all in a way that burns the faces of these young lads into our psyches.

About half way through this film Grodecki introduces Pavel Rousek, a man who by day is a pathologist performing autopsies in the Prague morgue and in his off hours (using the pseudonym  Hans Miller) creates, casts and directs gay porno videos in his home.  Rousek is shown at the autopsy table gowning, gloving, and grotesquely performing an autopsy on a real cadaver while discussing both professions.  There are moments while he is gloving that he explains why he doesn't allow his boys to wear condoms (the buyers of his videos don't want to see condoms), and the contrast between his self protection vs the enforcement of prevention of sexual protection of his actors is devastating.

Rousek as Miller is then shown filming the boys in his home, explaining the details of achieving the visual effects of pornography: simultaneously we again hear the boys views of that aspect of their 'careers', creating a pitiful tension.  There is almost no total nudity in this film and when it does occur the lighting is so dark as to obscure it - making the overall effect even more dense and effectively tense.  Under all of this lurid talk Grodecki uses classical music - Albinoni, Mahler, Mozart - which again provides a contradiction that makes the topic digestible.

The final question Grodecki poses to his subjects involves the boys perception of 'soul' and while there is a variety of responses, the overall message is that these lads sell their bodies as a career, but the soul is 'what you think', something that cannot be taken from you.  Several of these boys have screen presence and faces that, were they noticed by regular film makers, would probably give them legitimate careers.  But the power of the film comes from the words of these boys, knowing completely their choice of life, and therein lies the sorrow.

This is a tough but very fine piece of filmmaking.  Interestingly, Grodecki absorbed this material and used it to create his subsequent feature film MANDRAGORA (reviewed under that title).  This film is the more powerful of the two.  Not a movie for everyone, but certainly an important document about a way of life few know and fewer understand.

Candid interviews with both predators and victims alike allow the visitor to observe how deftly and skillfully an unsympathetic pimp/promoter/and oftentimes executioner, can entice, convince and then blackmail his victims into becoming porn stars. Systemic of a life of poverty, the boys recall how easily they and their peers became street hustlers. Converging at a well-known swimming pool in the city, unsuspecting victims are attracted by the promise of money, and too often find themselves defending the tragic lifestyle of the walking dead.
