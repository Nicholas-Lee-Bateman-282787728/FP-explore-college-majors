This is installment number 3----it's a brand new movie----in MOSTLY GHOSTLY.
The continuing story revolves around two young-adult ghosts trying to get their
parents back from some otherworldly misty-area between heaven and Earth. I
guess there are better flicks out there, but I am a 67-year-old COMPLETIST that
began buying the R.L.Stine films since my 25-year-old niece---seen with me in
an attached pic---was a little kid.
BTW: We BOTH love Hallowe'en, and always spend Hallowe'en at Frankenstein
Castle ruins... down the road from my German farm. ( I've seen better sequels. )",1474329600,8,655,5.431372549019608

7786644,5,B01HH20HHE,Great preteen spooky movie! My 8 & 10 year old loved it!,1483833600,2,56,3.75
7786645,5,B01HH20HHE,Good movie for all ages has humor and very mild spooks. This is the 3rd mostly ghostly it isn't as good as the first one. The second one wasn't great either but we still enjoyed them enough to watch them a few times like this one. If you love RL Stine go for it but if you haven't seen any of his other shows or movies I'd pick a different one,1483315200,,343,3.8450704225352115
