4653965,5,B005CRMXKQ,"So funny! I truly love Jeff Dunham? He's so talented, his ventriloquism skills are beyond incredible. So funny. Walter, Bubba J, Ahmed & His son ( best skit in the special) Jos and Peanut! Shot in one of my fav places in Virginia, besides Virginia beach., Richmond Virginia! This special is halarious. I don't have a bad thing to say about it, I love Chapelle, think he is a stand out comedian and the fact he is a ventriloquist at the same time being a top dog in the comedy world makes him so much more stand out star. My favorite part in the show is when a med is reunited with his son and the discussion of Osama Bin Laden being assassinated. Its so funny. I just can't help but laugh every time that character is on screen just like peanut I can't decipher who is number one on my list of favorite characters Scheffau am does but I will say Walter is number 2.

Don't know yet? If there is a album of this meaning a CD or LP which if there is a plan to buy it because I prefer audio comedy than video, but this was on sale for $9.99 HD! Normally a chaptered specials that are in HD on at least 13 dollars per HD to 15 dollars, and this was the longest one as far as I've run time. It runs for one hour and 35 minutes approximate. Whereas the rest are an hour and 10 minutes To an hour and 15 minutes. So I do get quite a bang for $9.99

Is this worth the buy? I would say yes, I don't give this 5 stars very often if you are a digital kind person like I am, this is the way to go, it's cheap, it's affordable, very funny and click of a button, and if you have a Kindle or any device that can run Amazon Video app it only takes up. A little over 200 megabits for HD quality.",1508025600,,1678,3.9469026548672566

4654239,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham's talent is so great that we, the viewers, may forget that he is the only ""real"" person there. His alter-egos, Walter, Achmed, and Peanut, become real. . . not only during the show but also while I remember the show. Perfect for those of us of a certain age who may live with or (heaven forbid) be Walter.

Jeff is at the prime of his career. I hope he realizes that and keeps up the great work - unlike a lot of my favorite classic personalities who quit at their prime and came back a decade later old and tired disappointing everone.

It can also be seen that Jeff does his homework preparing for the shows. Again, unlike other comedians who think they're so funny no matter what and come unprepared confident they can improvise their way through the shows and interviews.

Jeff: You are THE best ventriloquist ever, bar none.",1398038400,,667,4.55

4654387,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham has always been a bit pure in his shows; he never really did much swearing or gave off a feeling of being crude. I think that now that he's divorced, his children are older and he was at the time seeing a  younger woman (who he later married), he relaxed a bit. This time around he's a little less tight with how he says things, his characters use adult language and talk about sexual things without going over the top. This new Jeff is a bit surprising, but very nice to see. He seems truly happy, which makes the show much more enjoyable! He's hilarious to watch just like always!",1357776000,,594,4.303571428571429

4654440,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham has become one of my very favorite comedians of all time.  Yes, even though he is rightly thought of as a ventriloquist, it is his great COMEDIC talents that stand out to me.  That is not to minimize his talents as a ventriloquist, as technically he is very, very impressive here too.  Dunham's interactions with his puppets are so complex and realistic that Peanut, Achmed and company really seem to come to life in his hands!  In this show, my 2nd favorite Dunham DVD next to 'Spark of Insanity', he is on a real roll for basically the whole show!  (Any mistakes are redone and edited out, so the whole show flows seamlessly).  His humor is adult, but he is not excessively crude.  Jeff's interactions with the audience are quite amusing.  Dunham's humor would normally be considered offensive, but is not really perceived as such, since it is his dummies who make the offending remarks.  Interesting is how politically incorrect the humor often is, but he gets away with it because it seems like it is the puppets who make the non-PC jokes while Jeff gets 'upset' at them and apologizes for 'their' bad behavior.  Fascinating, as if a regular comedian made some of the same jokes, he/she would likely get booed off the stage, while Jeff's puppets get riotous laughter.  Anyway, if you enjoy great humor and fine ventriloquism, you will love this DVD.  Picture and sound quality are both impressive.  Extras are not especially great, but that's not a big issue for me.",1348012800,3,1482,4.719844357976654

4654444,4,B005CRMXKQ,"When I received the DVD Controlled Chaos in the mail, I was excited to see something new from Jeff Dunham.  I've watched both his prior Comedy Central specials on DVD several times and really enjoyed them.  Maybe I didn't read thoroughly enough before I ordered, but the only thing that surprised me about this release was that it was more ""adult"" oriented content, so, I was sure not to watch it around my kids.  With the prior Comedy Central speicals, I had put them on ""edited"" mode and my kids would watch them until their interest waned.  This usually took a few minutes to half an hour but half an hour was rare.

It was my mistake for not checking for content on this one, I know.  I just dislike having to wait til both kids are asleep or busy elsewhere to watch this release.  I still very much enjoyed it though.",1346112000,,822,4.368421052631579

just about everyday.  Because it makes me and my family laugh our butts off
and makes our day so much better.  I am still trying to figure out.  How he gets
""Peanut"" to get ""Ugly Jeff"" to talk.  He is so talented and is such A favorite
of me and my family.  I can't wait to see him here in San Diego on my Birthday this

I have seen a few Ventriloquists, but this person is Amazing than everyone else.  I immediately went on AMAZON.COM, and purchased all 4 of his Blu rays(Controlled Chaos, Arguing With Myself, Spark of Insanity & A Very Special Christmas) and 1 DVD (The Jeff Dunham Show). And after they arrived at my place, I saw all of them back to back in 1 week. And believe me, I would give each and every Show of his a 5 Star Rating.

Each of the Characters which he brings on Stage with him are really really Funny as no other. And I just realized one thing about Me, that I was Smiling & Laughing more in his Performances, than I have ever had in any Stand Up Comedy Shows.

If you had a Bad Day at work and you back home with Stress & Pressure in ur mind, watch this at Night and the Stress will be gone. You're getting bored at ur place and nothing interesting is coming on TV, put this On, even if you've seen this, still you'll be getting the Laughs cause of his impeccable performance.

Totally Recommended for Each and Everyone. And Believe me in this one thing, I am residing in India right now. But everytime I have a trip to USA, I check out on [...] , If he is performing anywhere near to the State I am going. And I Promised Myself that, If by 2013 Summer, I didn't get to see his Live Performance atleast once, then my next trip would be specially and only at the State where he is performing, to watch him LIVE. He is that Good and a Lot more Interesting & Funny.

Get his Performance Blu rays / DVDs Right Now.",1337558400,,1632,4.119496855345912

4654462,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff remains one of the most talented of all the ventriloquists/Comedians on any circuit of all time. Yes, he may be vulgar to some, but he is timely,literate, the kinda guy if you have  a daughter, would want  her to go out with. Your wife would have him over to dinner. He remains one of the most respectful On-Stage talents, who does not get arrested for drunk driving, or any of the other celebrity antics. Not only does he fly his own helicopters, but builds them from the ground up. His ""On-Stage companions are also designed and fabricated by him. He is known around the world, and you can see why.
If this is your FIRST time seeing him, I'd recommend his earlier work, just so some of his routines make more sense.
There are ""Bleeped"" versions for viewing with the  ""Easily Offended"".
When he DOES Cut Loose, its occaisonal, and not just for ""Shock Value"" like some of those out there,who swear just to offend.
His audiences are always ""Full Up"", and you'll see why.

4654464,4,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham is brilliant and professional as a ventriloquist, however this DVD having so much adult humor in it is quite a shift for him from his earlier performances.  The mocking of ethnicity seems odd at this level, the profanity isn't politically correct like he attempted to be close to before, and one of his new additions for characters was appalling due to how it minimizes hate crimes.  Jeff seems to be losing his edge, and going to burlesque-ish humor where an adults only crowd that is perverted or drunk can enjoy exclusively tailored tripe.  He was funny when Jeff started out.  He's decaying into looking like he's washed up and clawing desperately to keep from the abyss of knowing you need to find another career.  The DVD offers a ""bleeped"" version and an ""unbleeped"" version.  It sure as *$%@!!$@*$% isn't funny if you watch the ""bleeped"" version.",1335484800,,866,4.8175675675675675

He's got new material for his characters, but most of it just wasn't funny.  About half-way through, I suggested to my husband that we turn it off and watch something else.  But we watched it to the end and were totally taken by his bit with the 'little' version of some of his characters.  I give him 2-thumbs-up for being able to have a 'conversation' with 4 different ones PLUS himself!!!  THAT was awesome!!!  Too bad it was the only part of the show that made me laugh out-loud, and too bad it only lasted 5 minutes.  Next time I'll borrow the DVD from someone before buying it.

I have the right to say that because I lived there. I don't think Dunham had any right to say something like that unless he has facts on why he would say it.

Other than that I was extremely pleased with the level of service I had through through Amazon and the user as well. I lost my paper work telling me who that was, but nonetheless I am still really impressed.",1334534400,,523,4.077669902912621

This movie is funny but had a different feel than his others. Dunham's new life of his recent divorce and new young girlfriend seems to have altered his sense of humor. He cut out Melvin the superhero who mainly had perverted jokes, and gave those jokes now to Achmed. Achmed was always my favorite but he fell short in this one, and his son, Achmed Jr appears in it...along with Jeff Dunham the puppet... Walter and Peanut were still hilarious as always though!!!",1332806400,,672,4.56198347107438

All of Jeffs' regulars are here, Walter, Peanut, Achmed and my favorite Jose Jalapeno on a steeeeeek! The usual set up is in place like his previous shows starting with him along on stage with his solo stand up comedy. After that one by one his puppets we all have come to know and love come out for their own particular routine. As is usual with Dunhams' humour it is very politically incorrect which is what makes Jeff so funny. Especially since more of the humour is directed at himself. Having said that I do have to also say while I enjoyed this show it doesn't quite compare to his past shows. The jokes lack a certain something to it and they are a bit too raunchy. I really can't put my finger on it but there is just something missing from Jeffs' performance. The unedited act is not for young children, old people or those easily offended. They have an edited version for those groups that will allow them to watch without being offended. Still I would recommend this DVD but probably only to hard core fans like myself of Jeff Dunham.",1330905600,,1252,4.424242424242424
4654478,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff's biting sarcasm and social commentary continue in his latest tour video. His wonderful imagination for new characters and new dialog continue to amaze me. In this video, he is even able to poke fun at himself over his divorce, despite his own pain. And the source of this humor? Walter! (Of course) You go, Walter!!",1330041600,,321,4.75
4654479,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Very funny...and the extras make it well worth it.  There is a lot of additional, funny material that was not seen on Comedy Central.  Well worth it!",1330041600,,149,4.481481481481482
4654480,5,B005CRMXKQ,We are sad we couldn't see him in person when he came to Knoxville but the video was hilarious. Keep it up Jef-fa-fa!,1329955200,,117,4.130434782608695
4654481,5,B005CRMXKQ,"OUTSTANDING!!!  The best yet...the bloopers were great as well as the unsensered parts.  Would like to see his life's story on CD, the one he televised showing how he makes his puppets and tells of his life and how came to be where he is today.",1329523200,,244,4.282608695652174
4654482,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham seems to just get better with each show he does, save his short lived TV series (But you try doing something new every night and be entertaining). As usual he hit some things that might not be ""PC"" but he's a comedian and its expected that 9/10 every comedian will hit topics like that. It was also nice to see that he did give a shout out to the aid work going on in Africa, even if followed up by a joke. Its also nice to see that he's making fun of his own life and some of the downs he's hit in recent years such as his divorce. Well worth the $10 to own as its comedy gold.",1329350400,,590,3.884297520661157
4654483,3,B005CRMXKQ,"It is a very amazing and funny video that i have ever seen. He,Jeff Dunham, is a very great American ventriloquist.

4654495,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Thanks so much for the quick delivery of one of Jeff's real short and to the point shows. I love it. I like how the puppets are involved with a lot more than they used to be and the new additions that have been made to the show. Little Jeff and Little Peanut are histerical and AJ Achmed's son is classic in taking his time to explain why he has ome around to see his ""father"". Hope more people can come to love it too as I am a full Jeff Dunham FAN for LIFE!",1327363200,,459,3.8421052631578947

Excellent movie, laugh until you cry.

4654503,3,B005CRMXKQ,This title is good enough to add to your library primarily because of the lack of funny comedians.  I don't think this is something one would like to see multiple times.,1326585600,,169,4.451612903225806

4654507,4,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham, HI-larious. Why does a grown man and dolls make me laugh so hard? Is it because he can say just about anything and blame the dummies? I try to blame the cat, but no one ever believes me...",1326499200,,201,4.05
4654508,4,B005CRMXKQ,"While jeff Dunham is one of the funniest comediens out there, his latest DVD isn't the best I've seen. The high point is the end, which leaves you breathless from laughing, while the rest has several great moments, but not a laugh until you cry from start to finish like his other DVD's. Still a worth while purchase, well worth the cost.",1326412800,,338,4.467741935483871
4654509,5,B005CRMXKQ,If you like any of the previous Jeff Dunham dvd's...you will love this one!  I think he's outdone himself. Very talented. (I watched it 5 times the first week I got it.),1326067200,,169,4.28125

4654512,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Recommending Jeff Dunham is easy--he always delivers. A big fan of his since seeing him 12 years ago at the Punch Line in Atlanta, we are always excited to see his latest antics with his ""pals"". Ever irreverent and politically incorrect, without ever taking the blame, Jeff combines his own family and life in this performance, making us feel even more that we have actually met him. His life reflects some of our own embarrassments that are easy to relate to but his just seem to be over the top! That modest face and innocent look while his characters put him in ""chaos"" make the perfect combination for uncontrolled laughter. Get his book, ""All By Myselves"", as it is the best way to get the full Jeff ""Dun-Ham"" experience!",1326067200,,726,4.635658914728682
4654513,4,B005CRMXKQ,Think there have been better. Lots of time on audience conversation regarding Jeff's divorce. Do like Achmed Jr.... lots of potential there. Needs more development on Little Jeff. Glad to see the old man in ripe form.,1325980800,,217,4.891891891891892
4654514,5,B005CRMXKQ,I saw Controlled Chaos in person and loved it.  I laughed just as hard watching it on video.  It was great and highly recommend it for adults.  Jeff makes it clear that some of the content is not appropriate for children.  I was not surprised that I saw children at the live performance but I don't believe there was any reason.  The subject matter was over their head but great for adults.  I love Jeff Dunham's shows!,1325980800,,419,4.376623376623376
4654515,5,B005CRMXKQ,The characters are brought to life by Jeff Dunham and they are amazing in this video.  His is a creative genius.  I'm definitely checking out his other videos.,1325894400,,159,4.642857142857143
4654516,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Just like all of Jeff Dunham's Comedy Central specials, this one is absolutely hilarious.  On the Comedy Central special he mentions that if he does his act in China there is a part that he will have to leave out.  He says that you will know it when you see it, but the Comedy Central special left out that part of the act. You have to buy this DVD so you can see the whole thing.  Just as with his other DVD's, Jeff Dunham does NOT disappoint with this one. I will watch it over and over again.",1325808000,,495,4.030612244897959

4654519,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Purchased the DVD after seeing Jeff Dunham's act on the Comedy Channel.  He and his characters are ""not-politically correct"" funny, yet am glad for the bleeped version.  I received my purchase timely and in perfect shape.",1325721600,,221,5.111111111111111
4654520,5,B005CRMXKQ,Bought as a present for my son. He has already watched it a few times; including the bonus footage. Who knew that Jeff was such a handy handy guy. I prefer Spark of Insanity but I'm glad to watch this with my son and look forward to his next special.,1325721600,,250,4.02
4654521,2,B005CRMXKQ,"The first two DVDs by Jeff Dunham were terrific. In those DVDs Jeff's stage presentation was simple and fully allowed Jeff to be intimate with his audience and contribute his amazing skills of ventriloquism. Sadly, this DVD takes a plunge into being a piece of Las Vegas junk. The presence of multiple screens onstage, audiences that have been pre-prepared to clap, ""hoot and holler"", in phony appreciation that breaks up the flow of Jeff's presentation. Spotlights swiveling back and forth onstage to further ""jazz up"" the show. It seems that Jeff has sold out to the phony, slick Las Vegas type of show ($$$) that turns the quality of his work into pure junk. Money corrupts, so I won't be enabling Jeff's corruption by spending any more of mine on his future DVDs.",1325635200,,767,4.774436090225564

4654529,1,B005CRMXKQ,I had ordered this dvd for Christmas. I got it before then which was great but when i went to watch it on Christmas Eve. I found it to be not funny at all. The F word is used by every puppet and the jokes could be altered to be funny. I used to like Jeff Dunham but i'm very disappointed in this dvd. I must say i am not so sure i will want to order his next one that comes out. He might be not be married any more but i have to say when hew as married his stuff was A LOT more funny....and AJ  the new puppet reminds me of Chucky. that demented doll from the old movies. I must say this is the first dvd i wish i had known was like this i would not have gotten it. even the extra's are not impressive to me. I must say others might find this funny however i do not and i think he needs a realty check if he is going to continue this career of his.,1325203200,8,848,3.659340659340659

Aside from the fact that he is a VERY TALENTED VENTRILOQUIST (Seemingly 3 voices simultaneously) His comedic timing and his wit are far ahead of many. Check out the Documentary on the Biography Channel, very insightful into his beginnings, his struggles and his rise to today.

4654549,3,B005CRMXKQ,"I'm a big Dunham fan, but I'm glad I decided to rent this before I bought it. While Jeff is very talented, I don't feel this is his best show. There didn't seem to be as many laughs, either for me or for the audience.

Peanut is still, for me, the highlight of the show and the last bit was great. But Walter and Achmed didn't seem as funny as usual. And Jeff's bit in the beginning wasn't funny at all. It was the typical 'bad family photos' bit.

My main complaint was the 'new' puppet of Achmed's son. The dummy was disturbing looking and the bit wasn't funny AT ALL. Worse, it made Achmed less funny, too.

While I still enjoy Dunham's work and look forward to anything new he puts out, I just don't feel this is his best show. I enjoyed Spark of Insanity much more. Also there seems to be a lot more profanity in this show than in past ones. While it didn't bother me at all, I know some people probably were bothered by it and there did seem to be a lot in this show.

Dunham is great, but I would encourage anyone thinking of buying this to rent it first to make sure it's worth the money. For me, it wasn't, but others might enjoy it more.",1323907200,2,1147,4.084444444444444
4654550,5,B005CRMXKQ,"As expected, most of the characters are the same.  Some of the old standby jokes, and plenty of new ones.  His voice control is getting better, so the inter-character play is getting better.  His new character interplays with Achmed very well.  The voice control is amazingly demonstrated at the end of his act, where a 5-voice argument/interaction is pulled off well, showing how much Mr. Dunham has improved.

If you think you've seen this in TV (Comedy Central), think again.  TV had 40 minutes, minus commercials.  This was 97 minutes, plus extras (including sound-bites from his world tour).

Well worth the price, and everyone I've shown it to has seen it has loved it.",1323907200,,675,4.859649122807017

People need to stop expecting PERFECT clean family humor. He DOES include alot of family stuff but he is a comedian. If you are that mad and worried about the kids then why let them watch anything on COMEDY CENTRAL in the first place? It is a network for teens on up. Don't be such a nun and enjoy the jokes!",1323129600,,622,4.148760330578512

4654561,4,B005CRMXKQ,Jeff Dunham went with a more mature themed comedy with this show. While I enjoyed the humor (though not quite as much as his previous shows) I was not quite prepared for the adult nature of the jokes. Jeff still has it. He is the current master of the art.,1322870400,,256,4.14

4654567,2,B005CRMXKQ,"I've been a Jeff Dunham fan for years, but this last performance ""Controlled Chaos"" just did not come across to me as his best. It seemed like the timing of most of the jokes was off. I also didn't care for the appearance of Achmed's son with his face half removed. I didn't see anything really funny about that. We've got too many war veterans coming back missing parts of their anatomies and I've never found the conflict in Afganistan or Iraq to be particularly humorous. That part of the act came off to me as awkard, not funny.
To me it appears that Jeff has become distracted and his comedy is suffering for it. I hope he gets back on track soon.",1322697600,2,652,4.308943089430894

And yes, I think he needs a new writer, or to get started writing some funny, non bleeping humorous skits.  I just don't find it necessary.  The early years were not bleeped.

Walter in particular just wasn't as entertaining as he usually is. Instead of crotchety, he comes off more whiny, and he's starting to sound a lot like Peanut. I was bummed, because Walter is my favorite. Other than that, it was pretty good and I enjoyed the new characters. The scene with Achmed and his legs was priceless! So, all in all, fun and worth the money, but not as side-achingly funny as his past efforts.",1321228800,,531,4.541666666666667

4654601,2,B005CRMXKQ,"Did I actually receive the correct DVD? Is there a edited version and a non-edited one?

If this is indeed the only version, it is an awful production. It's just one bleep after another. I mean please, is it really necessary to bleep out the word ""piss?"" The Netflix versions of Dunham's other shows are tight productions, and though he uses off-color language in them as well, it's not censored for the most part and therefore flows much more smoothly than this chopped-up pseudo-production.

Another problem with this release is the extremely poor resolution. I have several DVDs that were purchased before the release of Blu-ray technology. Each one of them has substantially more sharpness, better contrast, and higher resolution than Dunham's current release on regular DVD. Is it maybe because the companies who produce and distribute it are salivating for the extra $3.00 garnered by the more expensive Blu-ray?

As for the show itself, Dunham is not quite up to his old self. Maybe the divorce has had an effect on his creativity. Let some time pass and maybe he'll be back on point. It's still a cute show. It's just not his best work. To put it in perspective, it's about as good as his television series was, emphasis on ""was.""

Overall, Dunham's performance is good, not great, just good. And as for the production, it's terrible, absolutely, positively terrible.",1320451200,2,1375,4.913793103448276

4654646,1,B005CRMXKQ,"As a longtime fan of Dunham's, I find it difficult to say this, but... this show is dreadful.  The jokes are knee-jerk racist slop.

I watched the DVD as far as the first two minutes of Peanut, but things got no better.

I have a considerable tolerance for what others might define as offensive, but these routines are merely derivative of so many prejudices, without giving the viewer any sort of resolution.

Very sad, very disappointing.",1319673600,4,440,4.75

4654653,2,B005CRMXKQ,"Full of FOUL language. NOT the Jeff Dunham that I love. I wish I never would have bought it. It seems he has resorted to bad language to fill in the time. While it had it's humorous points, it was not what I would've paid for by any means. The skits just are in poor taste and I am so very disappointed in him. Whatever has caused the change in his material, I hope he cleans it up before he does another DVD or show.",1319587200,5,417,3.9176470588235293
4654654,3,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff has been my favorite comedian from the time I saw him on VH1 comedy shows back in the early 90s, so I had to get this the moment it came out. I was a little disappointed at most of the performance, as it seemed to be missing much of Jeff's sharp wit. That's not to say it isn't funny. There are points where I was laughing so hard I cried (in particular, Jeff's routine with Achmed shines in this DVD as a stand out performance), but it seemed like Jeff has been worn down a bit by the Political Correctness elitists who are always complaining about his act. A little too much time in this performance was spent attempting to appease critics with asides and it seemed like he was trying to walk a mine field. Based on the out-takes and special features, it appears this special was produced like a sitcom, with multiple takes and a set flow. This detracts heavily from Jeff's true talent as an Audience Worker. Some of Jeff's best moments involve his working the audience with jabs and jokes, but that portion of his act is completely absent here, which is disappointing. There's almost too much polish on this DVD and not nearly enough of what makes Jeff a truly great comedian.",1319587200,49,1184,4.435779816513762

There is excessive bleeping which gets annoying quickly.  There are too many close-ups of the dummy where the viewer wants to see Jeff doing his craft.  Don't send for it.",1319500800,2,346,4.328125

4654666,4,B005CRMXKQ,"Short review this time.
The only reason I dropped this to 4 stars vs. 5 is that it seemed kind of short. I also didn't think ""Son of Achmed"" was that funny.
It is still a very funny show and is definately worth the watch.
The extra's such as Flirting With Victoria and Share The Hair had me LMAO. Go to his official site for previews if you want to know more about it.",1319414400,,368,3.9864864864864864

He made fun of people in South Africa being forced to live in huts made of dung, brought out a half dead son of Achmed that Achmed didn't remember and came as close as he could to diss his ex-wife without risking more $$$.

4654679,5,B005CRMXKQ,"""Controlled Chaos"" is hilarious. It's a comprehensive showcase of Jeff's comedic talents and unbelieveable abilities as a ventriloquist.  He is engaging, entertaining, and just flat out funny.  Plus, he keeps things fresh with his introduction of two new characters.  Very highly recommended, especially if you're a Dunham fan.

4654686,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Just have to say that the special is very funny and I'm sure you all knew that BUT there's more to this disc than meets the eye.  The special features are awesome.  Most discs have a couple of lame extras but this one has 9 really cool ones!  Usually they are just extra crap thrown on a disc to make it seem like you are getting more but not here.  My favorite is the ""Making of the Achmedmobile.""  It shows how Jeff and his buddies really worked their butts off making that car one of a kind.  Very cool.  They also included Bubba's visit to a winery and the tour opens from his previous tours.  Hilarious.  I love the one with Achmed in the cave/backstage.  Thanks for packing the disc with cool extras!  Keep 'em coming!!!!",1318464000,,727,4.272058823529412
4654687,3,B005CRMXKQ,"By now I think that most everyone has some familiarity with Jeff Dunham, but in case you don't, he is a ventriloquist.  But he's a ventriloquist with a wide range of characters that seem almost real and he does some comedy too and has managed to now make several movies and even had his own tv show for awhile.  This is the latest of those movies.

Controlled Chaos brings back Jeff's most beloved puppets, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, Jose Jalapeno on a Stick, Peanut, and Walter.  It also features two new puppets, Achmed's son and Little Jeff.  Each has their own personality and Jeff does a skit with one or two of them at a time, interacting with himself, each other, and the audience.  At the beginning, he also does a comedy routine without the puppets as well.

As said before, each of the puppets has its own personality.  Walter is a grouchy old man who really isn't afraid of saying anything to anybody.  He likes to lament his marriage and the youth today as well as anything else he happens to think is frivolous.  Achmed is fond of trying to kill people, and claims to harbor a relationship with other terrorists.  In this particular movie he interacts with his son which adds a whole new dimension to him.  Jose Jalapeno uses few words but they always seem to get many laughs.  Being that he is on a stick he doesn't move around much, but he isn't required too, unless someone mentions Mexican food.  Peanut is probably the oddest of Jeff's characters.  I'm not really sure what he is but he looks funny and tends to be real goofy and childlike and loves to get on Jeff's nerves.

While this particular movie had its funny moments, I didn't find it near as good as his other movies.  The new characters weren't that compelling and I wish he would have just stuck with his regular four or some of the other side characters he's used in the past.  The jokes sometimes fell flat for all the characters though and there were even a few uncomfortable silences in the mix.  Which is something that is not usual for a Jeff Dunham show.  I felt myself looking at the clock a few times to see when it would be over.  I did appreciate that it was mostly new material, as Jeff has reused material in the past, but it just wasn't the normal Jeff Dunham hilariousness that I'm used to.

I'll continue watching Jeff Dunham movie and shows because they are usually uproariously funny, but this one isn't one I'd recommend unless you're a die hard fan.

4654691,4,B005CRMXKQ,"I watched the video on Comedy Channel and enjoyed it very much. I had preordered the DVD prior to the show and knew there would be more than what was shown on TV due to time constraints.  There is quite a bit more than what was shown, but in previous shows, the DVD gave you the choice of the full version or the 'bleeped' version so that children could view it as well.  This DVD gives you no choice and it is bleeped.  I'm guessing there are constrainst of some type imposed by the lawyers over his divorce, which is why he didn't make much fun of it.
I recommend it and enjoyed it very much and think you will also.",1318032000,,618,4.090909090909091

4654696,2,B005CRMXKQ,"I watched the show on Comedy Central with my wife and son - all great fans of Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Jose.  But this show will, more me at least, be less remembered for his ventriloquist act but for his self-disclosure of early life and divorce. Otherwise, not much new ground, Achmed's son - nothing funny there.  Peanut and Jose, along with little Jeff and little Peanut were the highlights.

Unfortunately the most memorable segment was the intro; his school pictures and commentary were priceless.  A setup for the next segment with Walter; where Jeff poked fun at his divorce.  I found his divorce diatribe uncomfortable, if not sad, as much as it was funny.  Perhaps his next show will touch on pathetic middle-aged men leaving their wives, in this case a 29 year old nutritionist.  I think and hope not, best get back to the lives of his dummies, far more interesting and funny.",1317600000,,889,4.696774193548387

Jeff hit another home run with this one.",1317600000,,319,4.229508196721311
4654698,1,B005CRMXKQ,"I was so looking forward to Jeff Dunham's new show, as I've been a fan for years and think his past work is hilarious.  That being said, I found Controlled Chaos extremely disappointing and was not amused much at all.  I've read in the press that he went through a recent divorce and also the circumstances (which I won't go into as there are usually 2 sides to such things), but this entire show seemed to be a display of sour grapes and subtle (at times not too subtle) jabs at his ex-wife.  It is apparent he's upset with the property settlement the divorce brought about and let it spill over into his comedy.  He also seemed to ""brag"" about having a younger girlfriend.  I can understand his anger at his ex, but since he has children I find his material in very poor taste!  He seems to have no consideration for his children's feelings in relation to the divorce.  This particular show consisted of stale comedy, bitter material and culturally insensitive humor in the form of Achmed's dead son puppet.  Achmed's dead son puppet consisted of a half mutilated torso with a British accent.  Don't get me wrong, Achmed is one of my favorite characters, and I find the dead terrorist schtick very funny, but with a war in progress and people being blown up everyday (especially civilians and soldiers), it was almost sickening to see a puppet/character with half of his body disfigured by a bomb.  On top of that, the puppet appeared to be a white preppy type with a British accent(which I didn't get).  Maybe I misunderstood and just didn't get the bit.  Oh well, at least Peanut was still funny!",1317513600,9,1600,4.575438596491228
4654699,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Jeff Dunham takes it a step further with his new video. He shows he can do stand-up, then adds to it with his talents and the dummies. But he steps it up when the dummies have dummies, or Achmed has a son.  OMG, my sdes ached from laughing so hard. A must have for the JD fans!",1317513600,,277,3.8596491228070176
4654700,3,B005CRMXKQ,"Although Mr. Dunham has created a funny show, there are a few segments which I found a little disturbing.  Making fun of the famine and poverty in Africa along with the politics of S. Africa just isn't my cup of tea.  This show, in my honest opinion, should not be shown to children.  Compared to his earlier works, this one is sorely lacking.",1317513600,3,343,4.412698412698413
4654701,4,B005CRMXKQ,"This presentation was of course very professional.  I liked the family photos Jeff used in the opening of the act, along with his lead in to bringing in Walter and the others.  To me, his material was a repeat of ""A SPARK OF INSANITY"" to some degree.  Walter and Peanut are the stars of the show.  Achmed could be a lot funnier.  I thought his part was a bit lame.  Peanut was as crazy as ever.

I am not a prude, but I thought the quality of the show suffered somewhat with vulgarity being brought into it.  There is the option of watching a ""bleeped"" version, or ""non-bleeped"".  I chose the latter because bleeps are for broadcast TV and they detract from the flow of the material.  Just my opinion.  A SPARK OF INSANITY was hilarious to me and did just fine without the ""S-H"" word and the ""F"" bomb.

All in all, it was fun to watch, Jeff and the characters were funny and entertaining.  It could have been better.",1317513600,,916,4.286549707602339

Far too many F-bombs too. It seems like he was going for shock-value to make up for the weak material. Except for a few exceptions, it just wasn't funny.

Better luck next time Jeff.

4654714,5,B005CRMXKQ,"Okay, here we go (for a 4th time around)
I've read the reviews that have 4 or fewer stars and would like to address peoples comments.
A couple of people said that it was crude, but go back to the first dvd and tell me that on wasn't.  You could almost say he went back to that style/comfort level.

Funny tho, it seemed like he wanted to talk about his recent divorce, yet he didn't. I thought this dvd was outstanding & extremely funny, I'll have to watch it more to see if it has staying power, but when I watch some of his facial expressions during the short bits about his divorce, gives me the impression that he still gets choked up about it and that maybe he went back out on the road too soon, but who wouldn't go back out while your popularity is is high as his? Best part of the show was the ending with Peanut giving a voice to a Jeff Dunham doll. This felt like a grand finale to a fireworks show, Jeff amazingly performs 5 voices at the same time: Peanut, little Jeff, Jose, the Peanut habd puppet & his own. It was a rapid fire grande finale that I had to watch twice just to be able to catch all the spoken lines.",1317340800,2,1128,4.076576576576577

4654719,3,B005CRMXKQ,"We saw Jeff Dunham on tour in Denver this last year.  We couldn't stop laughing, and were in tears for most of the show.  We have really been anticipating this DVD so we could relive that experience.  Unfortunately, most of the material changed, and was not nearly as funny.  Even the audience wasn't laughing nearly as hard on the taping.  Perhaps it was just an off night, but not great.  It also seemed a bit short on independent characters.  We saw 5 plus the extras (A.J. and Jose), this only had 3 plus extras.  Granted, they are the 3 most want to see, but again, a bit disappointing.

We will certainly see Jeff again if he comes through, but may wait to buy the next DVD until we have rented it.",1317254400,,704,4.312977099236641

This new one was a mix for me, though. There were stretches where I laughed so hard I was literally tearing up, while other times I was just staring at the screen with distaste. I think he crossed the line a few times too many. Still, the funny parts were well worth sitting through the rest, so I still give it four stars. His improvisation is, as always, fantastic!",1317254400,,534,4.34
