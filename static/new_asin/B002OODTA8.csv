8376334,1,B002OODTA8,"I love the movie His Girl Friday and bought this on DVD to replace my VHS tape.  But, the quality of my VHS is so much better.  This DVD was a huge disappointment.  The picture is fuzzy and the sound is muffled.  It is cheap to purchase and it matches the quality.  Not even worth returning.  Don't waste your money.  Well, you really do get what you pay for.",1412467200,,359,4.115942028985507
