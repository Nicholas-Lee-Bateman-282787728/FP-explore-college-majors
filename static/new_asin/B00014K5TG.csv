8006368,5,B00014K5TG,"Spirit Warrior aka Peacock King is an amazing anime series. This is a great supernatural series with magic flying and creatures attacking. Great characters, great story, great dubbing, and amazing animation. This is one any anime lover should have....",1377993600,2,251,5.461538461538462
8006369,3,B00014K5TG,"A haunted statue is stolen from a room under high security and the thief goes unnoticed and doesn't leave a trail.  Fearing the the thief/thieves are supernatural in nature, the owner of the statue hires mystics to investigate its disappearance.
 It's the characters in this anime production that make it enjoyable.  The villian of the film doesn't steal the statue because he's evil and wants to `destroy the world' which would be typical in a lesser film.  No, instead in this, the villian was born with a skill that was relatively useless in today's society but has found an outlet to really show off what he can do.
 Kujaku, the main character of the film gets motion sickness while in a car/train which makes him feel like a regular human more so then your regular anime demon/spirit hunter.  The Master of Curses character is fun to watch because when he uses his powers, they tend to backfire on him.
 The drawbacks to Spirit Warrior: Festival of the Ogres Revival is that there are at least two occasions in which characters make reference to something which made me go what? Who?  And this is important because?  Well, at least they know what they're talking about.  Also, the action scenes tend to be okay in Spirit Warrior.  There is nothing wrong with okay action scenes except that the film's climax, which is a ten minute action scene, wasn't as exciting to watch as it should have been.  Sure the heroes were being beaten around but I didn't feel as if they were truly threatened.  But the climax, as is, is okay.  If the action scenes were more then okay, I could see giving this a four star review.
 The only difference I can remember between the sub and dubbed version of the film is that in the dubbed version of the film, they name their attacks (which I find funny) while in the subbed version they just make noises like `kai moh sai.....' type thing.
Anyway, Spirit Warrior is a fun way to spend fifty minutes of your life.",1077753600,11,1945,4.564841498559078
