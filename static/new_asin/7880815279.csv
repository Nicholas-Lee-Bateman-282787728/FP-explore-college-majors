1122378,2,7880815279,"I've seen a lot of movies and read a lot of reviews over the years, and I have never before found a movie that was judged so highly by well-known critics to be so poor. There is a fair amount of visual beauty, including that provided by lead actress Shu Qi. But the imagery amd music are repetitive, the camera work is slothful and uninspired, the music is largely trite and cloying, and the sparse dialogue is alternately trite and banal.  good love stories show you why and how the people love each other; these show you neither. I am a big fan of foreign films and I often like films that don't follow conventional formulas, and films paced slowly and without a lot of dialogue or action, e.g. The Silence and Cache. But without much dialogue, action, innovation, or substance, what's left is ""Three Times"".",1163203200,7,810,4.5479452054794525
1122379,5,7880815279,"Whenever someone says a film is ""a critic's movie,"" the charge is tantamount to the admission: ""I don't care to 'think'.  In fact, I'm so emotionally walled-off -- possibly as a result of exposure to our diseased American popular culture suffocating the global semiosphere 24-7 -- that I refuse to budge that single instant which might allow myself to open up to the possibilities outside of the so-called 'way movies should be', and what all the clip-packages and trailers announce I should expect and join in lauding.""  Would these same folks (who wear their ignorance like sham folksy wisdom, or the crust of an ersatz salt-of-the-earth set of mores) begrudge a painting for not telling a story, -- insofar as it's at odds with ""'mere' illustrations""?

Probably.

Hou's latest film is a masterpiece, something like his seventh consecutive one.  It's a triptych of stories (which is to say, of situations, the small moments of love in blossom and struggling against circumstance -- which is all to say: of lives lived) that relates the poignance, quietude, and soul in great love's first 20-something pop.  As always, Hou sets his own pace, hypnotic, charged and adrift, and shaded with a nuance that telegraphs its meaning via the mise en scne [ie, staging in the frame space] perhaps moreso than through any dialogue spoken.  Here's the same couple, more or less (handsome and sly Chang Chen; Shu Qi, beaming, detached, and opiate-cool, her beauty exploding off the screen), loving each other three different times in different moments in time -- in the 1960s, 1920s, 2000s.  This IS cinema mastery, you'll see it when you see it -- but not even to ALLOW oneself to respond on a visceral, never mind intellectual, level to these stories (yes, they're no less stories than those of Annie Proulx) is surely some willful abdication of humanity.  In short, 'Three Times' is the languid, slow-boil romance to Wong Kar-wai's feverish romance.  Yes, ""romance"" high and true -- that gesture Hollywood abandoned somewhere along the Gulf+Western pipeline.

A magnificent introduction to Hou Hsiao-hsien's films.  Work your way backward from here -- 'Caf Lumire,' 'Millennium Mambo,' 'Flowers of Shanghai,' 'Goodbye South, Goodbye,' 'Good Men, Good Women,' then skip the DVD of 'The Puppetmaster' because it's likely botched, lament the absence on DVD of 'City of Sadness' and 'Daughter of the Nile,' and finally move on to the four-film boxset from Taiwan (English subtitles included) of his first four features: 'The Boys from Fengkuei: All the Youthful Days'; 'A Summer at Grandpa's'; 'The Time to Live and the Time to Die' (supreme masterpiece); and 'Dust in the Wind' (masterpiece).  This is one of the world's greatest living filmmakers -- and one of the greatest in the history of movies.",1161388800,55,2788,5.06113537117904
1122380,2,7880815279,"This film is a darling of the critics. Roger Ebert gave it four stars, and A. O. Scott of the NY Times describes it, on the DVD's box, as ""a masterpiece,"" adding, ""this is why cinema exists.""  That being the case, if you are, or aspire to be, a devotee of cinema, then this film may be required viewing.  But if your sensibilities run toward (mere) movies, beware.

The film, set in Taiwan and China, depicts three love stories -- set in three historical periods: 1911, 1966, and 2005 -- using the same actor and actress.  The problem, simply put, is that ""Three Times"" moves at a glacial pace and little happens.  As one of the few critics not to wax euphoric put it, ""if this movie moved any slower it could qualify as a photograph.""  When each segment ended, and when the final credits rolled, the question plaintively asked by Peggy Lee came to mind: Is that all there is?",1159833600,12,876,4.409937888198757

Because it essentially consists of only two characters, there's not much of a storyline.  And to be perfectly honest, I didn't find either characters to be that well developed or interesting.  I suppose the theme would be how difficult it is to connect with people who we love, but did I have to be told that three times???  (Hence the title of the film.)  Many people walked out of this movie--especially during the very long second part.  I felt like doing it too, but I wanted to get my money's worth.  Unfortunately, I didn't.

1122591,4,7880815279,"Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao Hsien is a critically acclaimed auteur whose work is maddeningly unavailable on DVD. Of his 20 films only three are currently being offered at prices collectors can afford. Can someone (Artificial Eye, are you reading?) please give us his films from the 80s/90s preferably in a couple of cheap box sets? The Boys From Fengkuei (1983), A Summer at Grandpas (1984), A Time to Live, A Time to Die (1985), A City of Sadness (1989), The Puppetmaster (1993) and Good Men, Good Women (1995) all won prizes at major film festivals and it is criminal that we are denied a chance to see them. As it is we have only Caf Lumire (2003), Flight of the Red Balloon (2008) and the film under review here, Three Times (2005). Of these three I find the last the most satisfying. Caf Lumire is an excellent Ozu homage which accurately catches the transience of todays Japan while Flight of the Red Balloon involves an even greater cultural leap to the problems of single parenting in France. Fascinating as they are, I feel both lack the ingredient which many hold out as being the quintessential essence of Hous world, namely his passion for history, especially as refracted through peoples personal lives. Three Times marks a resoundingly successful return to this theme.

The film started out as a portmanteau project of three love stories lasting roughly 40 minutes apiece taking place at different times with the same two actors (Shu Qi and Chang Chen) involved in each one. Hou was only going to direct the 1966 segment subtitled A Time for Love with Huang Wen-Ying directing the 1911 part A Time for Freedom and Peng Wen-Chung doing the concluding story A Time for Youth set in the 1980s. The producer failed to stump up the cash for this and Hou eventually had to take charge of all three, deciding to move the final story to the present day (2005) partly to accommodate Shu Qi and partly because he wanted to reflect what was going on in Taiwan at the time. Its actually important to understand a bit of history to get the most out of these subtle and elusive little film-lets and Ill try to fill in some gaps in what follows.

The first story A Time for Love is set in 1966 because that was the year of the Cultural Revolution in mainland China and consequently a time of great freedom in Taiwan. During the time America was a big influence on Taiwanese affairs making sure the sixties liberation of western society profoundly affected those hitherto conservative shores as well, moving the country even further away from mainland China than before. This was also the time Hou grew up in and the story of a young man on the verge of doing compulsory military service following a young snooker girl around the various billiard halls is autobiographical. The film is a true nostalgia piece in which not a lot happens narrative-wise, but through Hous trademark long takes, subtly-improvised play from the actors and the use of pop music of the era  Smoke Gets in Your Eyes by The Platters and Rain and Tears by Aphrodites Child  a romantic atmosphere is built up to hugely impressive effect. It is the only story of the three that has a positive conclusion and is the one which most critics have singled out for special praise.

The second segment A Time for Freedom has been under-rated mainly because of the subtle and elliptical way it is shot, its reference to cultural points unlikely to be grasped easily by westerners, its obscure historical point of reference, and Hous decision to film it as a silent film with speech rendered in inter-titles. We need to grasp that 1911 was an important year for Taiwans history. It was the year of the Wuchang Uprising (October 10, the Double Ten Day now celebrated by Taiwanese as their National Day) which led to the Xinhai Revolution bringing the Qing Dynasty and two millennia of imperial rule to a close. The people of Taiwan longed for this freedom as well, but since 1895 they had been under Japanese control and the freedom gained by Chinese living on the mainland was denied them. This desire for freedom is refracted in the story of a courtesan (Shu Qi) living in a brothel. Ordinarily her freedom would be bought by a man agreeing to make her his concubine. However, her younger sister (another courtesan) is impregnated by a customer and is sold out in her stead. The deal is enabled by the generosity of her best client (Chang Chen), a political freedom fighter/writer who likes her, but won't commit to buying her out because he is against the system of concubinage and is in any case over-committed to the political cause of fighting the Japanese through diplomacy. Like Taiwan itself, the courtesan is trapped by the system to a life-time of servitude. Here Hou returns to the style of Flowers of Shanghai (a 1998 film set in the same Japanese period) and utilizes the same long takes in a single indoor location setting. For me this is the most powerful segment of the film as the courtesans plight is subtly and heart-breakingly rendered, especially the scene where a new 10-year old girl is bought into the brothel and she recognizes herself in the young child. Again Hou demonstrates his wonderful sense of using music, in this case a piano score (by Lim Giong and Li Kuo-Tuan) which seems to be talking with the beautiful images as they play out for us with the most delicate restraint. You will need to see this 2-3 times to understand what Hou has done here. Some have found the silent film style somewhat affected and self-consciously arty (Hou explains that actors didn't have time to master the old Han language essential for recreating the era), but I wasn't too concerned. The inter-titles actually give more information than the scant dialog in either of the outer sections of the film and the total effect makes one yearn to see those earlier Hou films we are currently being denied.

The final segment of the film A Time for Youth whizzes forward to 2005 and emphasizes Hous concern with the state of contemporary Taiwan. The presidential election of 2000 had brought the end of the rule of the Kuomintang (the KMT) and since then internal politics had been split down the middle. In 2004 the Democratic Progressive Party had come to power and was looking to declare Taiwans independence from the mainland for good. Recognizing this, mainland China (the PRC) passed an anti-secession law in 2005 authorizing the use of force against Taiwan if they went ahead and declared. This political (and therefore social) uncertainty is refracted in the uncertainties embedded within the relationship between the central couple and particularly in the fragility of the girl (Shu Qi). Prematurely born (like Taiwan?) with broken bones, a hole in the heart, epilepsy and partial blindness the girl is a wild free spirit created from the internet. In her own words she is a girl with No past, no future  just a greedy present  a yen tattoo on her throat with a declaration that her soul is for sale to anyone willing to pay the price. Fundamentally confused about her sexuality (she is bi-sexual) and ignorant of the affects her selfish actions have on others, this student of photography and would-be singer perhaps represents a nation in crisis, a nation in need of a new direction, a new sense of morality. Her photographer partner (Chang Chen) has no more integrity than she  like her he is also cheating on an existing partner and thinks nothing of the consequences of his actions. This transient moral rootlessness is what lies behind the numerous shots of motorcycle rides around Taipei, especially the two that open and close this story of empty and directionless sexual relationships which evidence no concerns which are anything other than skin-deep. Again Hou shoots using long takes which take into his stride the confusion of the metropolis. Bright neon exteriors contrast with endless shots of people conversing with their laptops and cell phones. Shu Qi comes to the fore here with a noteworthy performance of selfish disaffection and even gets to sing two druggy nightclub trip-hop numbers which stay long in the memory. Her club routine takes us back to the atmosphere of her last film for Hou, Millennium Mambo (2001).

Three Times perhaps showcases Hou Hsiao Hsien at both his most typical and his most accessible. It is therefore an outstanding introduction to his world. Anyone who is taken with this will doubtless want to investigate his other earlier films which are said to be even greater. I wish I could talk with more authority about Hou, but like everyone else I am currently unable to see those masterpieces listed at the head of this review and cant make the usual comparisons to see how his art has developed. This Artificial Eye DVD does carry a Hou filmography which lists A City of Sadness and Daughter of the Nile (1987) as two of their releases. Well, where are they? The disc does carry an excellent 30 minute interview with Hou (the source of much of my review here) which is a considerable bonus. The quality of the film itself is also excellent, the images and sound both ideally clear. As for Caf Lumire, Asian cinema expert Tony Rayns provides the very clear subtitles (I take my hat off to anyone who can translate both Japanese AND Chinese into English!), but again its a pity he couldn't add a commentary as well. He has probably done more than any other western critic to get Hous name more recognized as his reviews for Time Out testify. Lets hope his efforts lead to more of his films being made available soon. Three Times should win new friends for a director who by rights should be heralded alongside other masters of the long take and the use of ellipsis, Theo Angelopoulos, Wong Kar Wei, Abbas Kiarostami, Bla Tarr and Michael Haneke.",1411430400,,9767,4.750147318797879
1122592,5,7880815279,I have watched the first part of this trilogy many times from local video stores.  Because it is a trilogy I can only discuss the first part.  In the first of three videos a young man has failed the entrance exam to a Taiwanese University so he has signed up to join the army and is cycling to the Army base for assignment.  Along the way he meets a beautiful girl.  This film won several awards and is not a film for people who only like action adventure.  This is a film for thinking romantic people.  It is only 25 min long.  Included in this collection are two other films which I have not watched.  My problem is I am using Linux Mint 14 operating system and Amazon seems to be incomputable with Linux.,1394841600,,707,4.223880597014926
1122593,5,7880815279,"I saw this movie several years ago after running across it at my local Blockbuster, and I have not been able to stop thinking about it since. I didn't know anything about the film maker Hou Hsio Hsien but immediately could perceive that he was influenced by the great Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu, who is one of my all time favorites.

In Three Times we are presented with three sequences and two actors, moving through time. The first film is a beautiful, simple love story, set in 1966. This period tallies with Hou's youth, which he regarded as a golden age and the two leads are healthy, charming, innocent and hopeful. Everything is green around them: nature, early summer rain, the poolroom, hope and young love. Slow because the days were longer then, and time did not move as quickly.  Absolutely beautifully done.

The second is shot like a silent film, the time period is 1911, the setting a brothel--yet the viewer is looking at a man and a woman through a screen, and doesn't understand that in the beginning. Only after the scene develops, do we get a sense of what is actually happening. What ensues is an absolutely devastating story. A wealthy intellectual, in a noble gesture, will buy the freedom of a young prostitute and pay her dowry in order to marry her off, while he obtusely leaves behind his own beautiful mistress and child to their own devices as he goes off to join the nationalist cause. Devastating.

The third story is set in a contemporary urban milieu- concrete,sprawling and ugly, where degeneration, decay and alienation rule the day, as evinced by the physical constitution of the half blind epileptic girl pop musician and her new lover, the young photographer for whom she leaves her lesbian lover.

Critics have suggested that the film is either a historical take on male-female relations, a story about failed happiness, or failed communication. I don't think that is terribly important to pin down the meaning of the film. Like many poetic, masterful creations that don't need to spell things out for the viewer or tack on a message it can be interpreted in multiple ways.

1122707,4,7880815279,"Three Times is a highly acclaimed film from Hou Hsiao Hsien that involves three separate stories of love, each featuring actors Shu Qi and Chang Chen. In hindsight, they are not so much about love as they are about longing.
The first part (A Time for Love) is a tender and utterly charming vignette about the pursuit of love set in 1966 Taiwan. Chen is a soldier who periodically returns to a pool hall to see the attendant there (Qi).  The second part (A Time for Freedom) is a silent movie set in a brothel during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. The third part (A Time for Youth) is set in present day Taipei and involves a love triangle between Qi, her female lover, and Chang. It is a sad and bleak vision of love to say the least.
The titles sum up each story as we have love that blooms in the first title but suffers under the sexual inequality of one era and the self-absorbed and nihilistic inherencies of another. All three pieces are short on dialogue and thus demand much of the viewer to observe and interpret.
Qi is good throughout; sweet and shy, graceful and demure, or angst-ridden and self-destructive. Chen is given a bit less to work with, but he does a good job as the love interest, especially in the first part.
It's hard to distinguish where my personal feelings of love start and where the stark yet genuine treatment of love from three different stories ends. I would say that there are times in my life when I would prefer each one. To that end, love as portrayed in Three Times starts out with great promise and hope, runs into obstacles, and then turns sour and dies. Furthermore, after such a wonderful beginning, it's fair to say that the movie leaves the viewer wanting so much more and feeling disappointed and cheated. Perhaps that is Hsien's intended commentary about love as a whole. I hope he's wrong.",1322352000,2,1841,4.5119760479041915

1122709,1,7880815279,"Ok, maybe this movie is for those that like obscure, ""artsie"" films, but for the normal watcher, I do not advise getting this film.  I enjoy Asian film and am a fan of Shu Qi, but this was boring and tedious to watch.

The film is divided into three separate short films:
1. In 1966, where Shu Qi working at a pool hall, meets the main male role.  He goes to war, comes back can't find her, then goes around the country looking for her. Finds her, then holds hands.  Very little dialogue, and that's about it.

2. I believe, it's 1922, the film is in color, but has no speaking parts, but written, like it was a silent film.  She's a prostitute in a professional brothel, he comes to visit her while he travels the country with a famous poet.  A girl in the brothel gets pregnant, he helps the ""father"" to buy the other girl, but won't buy Shu Qi out of brothel, and that's about it.

3. In 1995, Shu Qi is a bi-sexual girl with tattoos, who spends most of the film smoking cigarettes and riding a motorcycle, and her ""girl-friend"" commits suicide because she is out with a man (I guess, it doesn't give many details).

So, three short boring films, very very little dialogue, very little action, no sex, no nudity, but a lot of time waiting for something to happen- which never does!",1279238400,12,1284,4.316666666666666

1122711,5,7880815279,"One caveat: you have to be willing to read lots of subtitles if you want to get the most out of this film.

One theme that this director returns to is Taiwan's identity crisis, first as a Japanese protectorate, and then, as a landing base for the Nationalists (who lost the Civil War against the Communists in China.)  The Nationalists took the remnants of their army and declared martial law in Taiwan, which was a huge social, linguistic, and financial upheaval to those already living on the island.

The three films show Taiwan in three different periods, with three sets of lovers (played by the same two actors).  Each film is beautifully shot, and well-acted by the two leads, who are very intense, especially in the first two films.  The third film loses some of the momentum, though, but perhaps that is fitting as it is about the confusion of Taiwan's youth (and the conundrum of Taiwanese national identity.)

Chang Chen, whom you may have seen in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Interest (as Jen's love interest), is brilliant and intense here.

Shu Qi, who's often underrated (and has not always chosen the best material), is luminous and does not over- or under-act here.  She does an amazing job in the second film, relying primarily on body language to communicate her despair.

The first film is lovely and romantic, but may also be interesting to language buffs, as some of the dialogue is in Taiwanese, which (like Cantonese, is a ""Sinosphere"" language, but a distinct language.  Mandarin speakers will find most Taiwanese unintelligible unless they learn the language separately.)",1266019200,2,1592,4.928838951310861
1122830,4,7880815279,"This is a haunting movie, which uses very little spoken dialog, and instead leaves the viewer to empathize with the emotions of the lovers.  The movie has a special and unique feeling by virtue of this method of story-telling alone.  By forcing the viewer to constantly ask ""what is he/she feeling now?"" the viewer is involved into each relationship almost as if the viewer was a silent third participant in each relationship.

I would like to have seen each relationship's back-story more fully developed.  Instead, we get short glimpses into the history of each relationship, and we just have to infer how each relationship progressed.  This may have been a deliberate decision of the story-teller, to trick the viewer into feeling more of the longing for the beloved - or the emptiness of the moments between love - than thinking about a narrative set of facts.

The first two stories have no visible sex, which enhances the story's focus on love as a condition of longing.  In fact, a possible short coming of the stories is that they do not seem to reach for any conclusion.  The beginning and ending point of each relationship seems to be the longing that each lover has for the other, each time fulfilled only imperfectly.  The viewer is left dangling in each case, with many unanswered questions, trapped in the promise, occasional despair, and angst of love.

The final story is set in an era of sexual liberation, but the irony is that the participants seem more miserable in love than any of their naive historical predecessors.  Free to have sex with anyone, Shu Qi seems to have no real purpose in love.  She appears to be reduced to a set of impulses - none of which are well-explained, and none of which appear to satisfy her basic emotional needs in a sustainable or satisfactory way.

For a Western audience, this film begs to have another track on the DVD where the director or producer gives his take on each scene.  I suspect that there are some Taiwanese cultural aspects to each film that would never be obvious to a Western audience without a guide.",1262476800,3,2072,4.703601108033241
1122831,5,7880815279,"This movie is three independent portraits of eras and different aspects of the human condition.  The first is set in 1966 and is a portrait of the search for love.  The second takes place in 1911 (despite the product description, this seems like a mansion, not a brothel) and tells the story of the need for freedom from a contract of servitude.  The final piece demonstrates the heartbreaks and regrets of youth.

Each portrait is a reasonable attempt to match the style of movies of the period in which it is set.  For example the 1911 piece is done as a silent movie.

The movie's greatest weakness is also its greatest strength.  All of the scenes have a very pedestrian feeling which takes some time to get used to.  However, the same slow approach immerses the viewer in the worlds of the characters in a way which other movies do not do.

Also the movie is short on dialog and the focus of the manners and facial expressions of the characters is central.

This is a great movie, but may seem a little slow for some.  The acting is superb, as is the directing, etc.  But not everyone will enjoy it.  However, I would still give this 5 stars.  I will probably watch it again and again.",1244851200,10,1190,4.423963133640553

The director and actors catch the zeitgeist of each period, the relationship of the sexes, the longing, the beauty of love in a way I have never seen in occidental cinema.  The East has an esthetic that is probably inaccessible to us westerners.  But it is enchanting to be able to enjoy it now and then.",1235260800,5,479,4.654761904761905
1122833,5,7880815279,"Three Times is quickly becoming my favorite film, with each viewing I find a new favorite segment.  At first it was the third, then the first, now the middle....and those were five viewings ago.  In addition to picking a favorite segment, another difficult task is coming up with an overarching theme that connects the three pieces aside from the same two main characters.  As a Taiwanese American, I'm partial to Hou's films, but I admit that they are not always easy to understand, or appreciate.  Ultimately, it comes down to if the movie strikes a cord with you.  For me it did, but I can understand why for some it is only less boring than watching paint dry.

There are so many wonderful moments in the film for me that I can easily fall in love with this film without having to cohere the three different stories.  Whether it is the familiar roadsigns that distinguish the drab, nondescript little towns from one another on Chang's quest to find Shu in ""A Time for Love,"" which remind me so much of my own frantic drives on the highway in anticipation of seeing a loved one, or the heartbreaking piano score that picks up its pace as Shu ponders the lamentable fate the little girl is about to enter in ""A Time for Freedom,"" which can be heard on the trailer for the film on youtube by the way, this film immerses and tugs at you surreptitiously and from all directions.

The more I watch the film, the more I struggle to find Hou's message for this film.  Is he trying to say that love is eternal, unapologetic and transcends time or that it is cruel, ever-changing and subject to interpretation?  This film merits repeated viewing.  Give it a chance, and another one, perhaps a third, and decide for yourself.  Dare I say it, you don't have to be a fan of Hou's aestheticism and narrative style to enjoy this film.",1230595200,16,1823,4.507598784194529

Art is always subject to interpretation.  For those who enjoy films that provoke ideas, introspection and philosophical debate, this is one such film.

Shu Qi and Chang Cheng are the lovers in acclaimed filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien's latest work.  The film is almost like a non-sci-fi version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fountain/dp/B00005JPAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fountain</a>&nbsp;set instead in three different eras in Taiwan. The actors play three sets of lovers in different historical settings, including 1966, 1911, and 2005. While ""The Fountain"" had eerie implications of reincarnation and a science fiction element, this film is instead a commentary on the universality of love.

In each of the historical periods, we see a very different kind of courtship where physical interaction is very limited.  Yet in the modern era, it is possibly true intimacy that eludes them despite their easy access to physical satisfaction.  While I will spare you the plot synopsis, watch carefully and draw your own conclusions.

The acting in this film is very subtle and stylized.  The storyline is also developed slowly in each of the scenes.  This allows us to really reflect on the historical context of each vignette, but it also makes this an impractical movie for the impatient and those looking for the simple pleasure of a movie instead of homework.

The real emphasis here is on the framing of the actors in idealized scenes.  In that sense, the director uses all of his skills to strip away as much of the characters so that what we see most is their romantic interaction.  These scenes approach photographs and the effect was intentional.

Conclusion

While I do believe this film is beautiful and well made, this is definitely a niche movie that is not for all audiences.  I highly recommend this movie to students of Chinese culture and history as well as lovers of independent film.

If you are looking for a movie to be enjoyed at face value, look elsewhere as this may move too slowly for you.  If you are willing to dig a little deeper, there is a lot of thought provoking material here.  Give it a try.

1. It's a movie about how love evolves in Taiwan where is a blend of 50-50 Chinese-Japanese* culture. You would be interested in learning the nuance difference.

2. Do these lovers become more open about their feeling toward love as time changes? ie. wording, body language, aspect and whatnot gestures and approaches.

3. What does a relationship mean to them in these 3 periods?

Interesting enough to you?
And plus, this movie gives you an exquisite taste of the old times, exciting flame of the new era, and a bridge connecting these two.
You will find your family, friends or even yourself in these 3 periods [as time goes by].

Historical Note:
Taiwan was a colony of Japan between 1895 and 1945.
The Republic of China = Taiwan, was born in 1912.
You see the culture and policies are overlapping here.

1122978,4,7880815279,"This is a beautiful film to watch despite the emphasis on stark reality. But it's a movie that's only going to interest a small percentage of the moviegoing population.

Even tho conflicts are vital ones like love and death, the stories are barely there. They strive for everyday naturalism -- without any of the dramatic peaks and valleys we've grown accustomed to in fiction. Most viewers will wonder when the story's gonna start.

The first of the three love stories (with same two lead actors in each, the female being the sexy, full-lipped Shu Qi) has VERY sparse dialog. But it's about characters unable to express themselves. The last story has a little more dialog but, like the first, it's all indirect. The drama comes from the behavior of the characters and from the things they don't say aloud. If the viewer is tuned into those sorts of things, considerable tension builds up which carries him along.

The second story is the most talkative -- but it's almost all silent! Title cards are used like in the silent film days. A gutsy trick, but I didn't find it entirely successful. Plus, it's also the most difficult to understand for those unfamiliar with Taiwan's culture or history. However,  it's visually stunning since it is set in 1911 in a traditional Chinese home.

Another warning: the chronologies of the first and last episode are confusing at times thanks to the filmmaker's choice to avoid conventional means of identifying flashbacks. It's kinda funny that he chose to clearly label the chronology in the second episode which hardly needed it.

Here's a movie for those people seeking something new. Something daring. Something edging closer to reality. This could be the future of cinema.",1192147200,3,1715,4.916955017301038
1122979,4,7880815279,"THREE TIMES (Zui hao de shi guang) is so frank a film that the viewer may get lost looking for the hidden meanings in this century traversal of lovers' interactions in China.  Not one for simple linear filmmaking, director Hsiao-hsien Hou instead opts for mood and suggestion and leaves the paucity of dialog to make room for emotional involvement and response.  Three periods - 1966 A Time for Love, 1911 A Time for Freedom, and 2005 A Time for Youth - are depicted with the same main characters, Qi Shu and Chen Chang, who prove to be exceptionally sensitive to the concept from the director: with each new tale these fine actors mold new characters and questions and yet allow us to see a line of similarity in the couples as the director has suggested.

The film wisely opens with the most successful of the three 'Times' - 1966 A Time for Love - - tracing  the emergence of timid passion between a lad headed for the military and a young girl who works in a pool hall. They communicate by letters after their first brief introductory encounter and circumstances interfere with the progress of their relationship in 1966 Taiwan.  The middle section 1911 A Time for Freedom is gorgeous visually and conceptually the director has elected to use the cinematic form of the period (silent movie) to tell his story about the freeing of a young girl from the grip of a brothel madam and surveys the political tensions between Japan and China as the quietly lighted story of love and yearning unfolds. The film ends with 2005 A Time for Youth and here our lovers are caught up in the pollution of smog, cellphones, emails, nightclubs, and infidelities for same sex affairs that speak loudly about the tenor of the times.

Hsiao-hsien Hou's films are an acquired taste and many will find the choppy editing, the fragmentary scenes that are not always well focused for the story line, and the over-long length (130 minutes) too much to endure.  But the ideas are fresh and the characters and vignettes are memorable, and most of the major critics in the media have lavished praise on this film.

1122981,4,7880815279,"Taking on love and history, three films from China's 'Three Times' come together showing how life is full of waiting and longing, unfulfilled wishes and the slow steps it takes to their realizations.  The first film takes place in 1966; the second in 1911; and the last in 2005.  Each focuses on a man and woman in love (Shu Qi and Chang Chen), with each scene showing the deliberate patience of its protagonists (and by the way, requiring it of the audience) waiting for fruition in political developments and love relationships waiting for consummation.  Each film is framed with a woman singing a romantic song, depicting the sweet and sour of life.

In 'A Time for Love' (1966) May works at various pool halls, playing with male customers and maintaining the felt on the table.  Patiently, she gets various letters from a boyfriend who frequented the pool hall, but is stationed in the Chinese army.  When he returns he looks all over to find her.  Beautiful romantic ballads and a version of Pachebel's 'Canon in D' serenade them.  Their quiet moments together speak volumes.

Then, we're taken through 'A Time for Freedom' (1911) in a placid household filled with tranquil still lifes of a still-ancient Chinese setting.  Piano music with oriental rhythms serenade each scene as the dialogue is revealed on the screen like a silent film.  The soft development takes through meals and drinking tea with conversations about China's negotiations with Japan and a woman, Ah Mei's, consequential need for a dowry.  The subject of the morality of keeping concubines is also discussed.

Next, 'A Time for Youth' fast-forwards to the present.  Such a startling contrast to the last film, our lovers are on a motorcycle going through the modern roadways of Taipei.  Although without all the waiting and ritual of the previous eras, our two lovers seem even less happy.  They have all their freedoms and trappings of electronic gadgetry, but their lives gel less.  The woman also has a girlfriend and keeps both her lovers on a short leash by her cell phone.  She suffers crying spells, and the song she sings at the modern club is filled with anguished desperation.

Don't expect 'Three Times' to jump out at you.  'Three Times' is a beautifully shifting mood piece that works like a series of paintings.  It is a fine composite of a hundred years of China's history framed by love stories and exquisitely shot backdrops that quietly ask us to wait for gratification just like our protagonists.  Idyllic and moving, 'Three Times' is a gentle capsule of love and history throughout the century.

Like so many foreign and independent films these days, Hsiao-hsien Hou`s ""Three Times"" is less concerned with telling a story than with observing the rituals of everyday life.  The movie is so-titled because it uses the same set of actors to tell three different tales of love spanning nearly a century of Chinese history.

The first segment, ""A Time for Love"", set in 1966, is a sweet and tender tale of an arm's-length romance between a pool hall hostess and the soldier who pursues her.  The second, ""A Time for Youth,"" in which a singer yearns for a life outside the brothel in which she works, takes place in 1911 and borrows its style from silent films, using title cards rather than voices to convey the dialogue.  The final part, ""A Time for Freedom,"" is a contemporary tale of a bisexual woman caught between her male and female lovers.

All three episodes are more mood pieces than narratives, with emotions and meanings hinted at rather than externalized and dramatized.  This is fine up to a point, but eventually, as a trilogy, ""Three Times"" becomes a case of diminishing returns the longer it goes on.  The first section is a work of tremendous charm and beauty, the second considerably less so, and the third is so inscrutable in content and desultory in tone that the viewer winds up virtually pulling his hair out in frustration and boredom by the time it`s over.  There are some distinct parallels between the first and second story, and I'm sure that one could come up with some grand thematic scheme connecting the three works, but, frankly, none of it really holds together all that well, apart from the use of letters (or, in the case of the third installment, text messages) as a key plot device in each section.

Qi Shu and Chen Chang have charisma and rapport as the two time-hopping lovers, but even they are not enough to keep ""Three Times"" from being much less than the sum of its parts.",1169337600,14,1922,4.64306784660767

This is an exquisite movie; it is as beautiful as only a painting by Vermeer can be. It has subtlety of tones, a warm touch, it is deep in nested levels of understanding: a meditation on love and woman condition, on Taiwan history and present, on Hou Hsiao-Hsien's cinematic universe. These levels send signals one another: a world of reflecting mirrors.

1966: in Mainland China it is the Cultural Revolution: youngsters are in the Red Guards, and the country closes itself in terror and absurdity. In Taiwan, though the regime still keeps a firm hand, it's an opening, you breath it in the air: Taiwanese youngsters are in the military getting ready for war, while listening Beatles and dreaming love. During short permissions they hang out in pool parlors and fall for the girls there. Yet they are too shy to speak to the girls, so they send them very polite letters where feelings are suggested by some rhymes from a song, the kind of Rain and Tears,

Rain and tears are the same,
but in the sun
you've got to play the game.

When you cry in winter time,
you can pretend
it's nothing but the rain.

Hey, it's us, the boomers: our portrait of forty or forty-five years ago, our time for love. Hou Hsiao-Hsien, the director, is like us a baby-boomer, he was born in 1947. His memories are there, he at twenty years, passionate for billiard, easy falling in love, writing long letters full of rhymes and songs, running during short permissions after the girl of his dreams, finding her, both discovering the magic of love, both too shy to have the courage of a kiss, only looking at each other while sipping tea together.

The purity of young age rendered by the purity of cinematic minimalism. And the great image of the pool table, where the bills are telling their own stories, about strategies of play, about desire to win, and despair to loose. It's an unforgettable image this one of the pool table, and it speaks volumes about the talent of the cameraman Lee Pin-Bing, one of the two or three greatest cinematographers of today.

This is the first vignette of the movie, the Time for Love. Full of warmth and nostalgia. It's Hou at the beginning of his twenties, observed by Hou now in his sixties: his movies from the 1980's come in support, as this vignette is mirroring them. The spirit of The Boys of Fengkuei is floating freely in Time for Love. Most part of the action takes place in the same port-city of Kaohsiung. The Green Grass of Home sends its echoes in Time for Love, along with Hou's very first two movies, Cute Girl and Blind of Love. A cineast thinks at the epoch of his youth through his own language of cinematic structures.

From the memories of our youth we travel back in time, down to 1911.

In Mainland China the Time for Freedom has arrived. It's the Wuchang Uprising, leading to the Revolution that would put down the Empire and proclaim the Republic. Meanwhile Taiwan is under Japanese rule: it just started, in 1895.

The young intellectuals dream of freedom and write patriotic poems and passionate columns in newspapers. A young woman, courtesan in a luxurious brothel, falls in love for one of these intellectuals and hopes he would take her out. He is too absorbed by his dreams for Taiwan to notice her own desire. She's still hoping ... after some months a letter comes: he is now in Shanghai, taking part at the Chinese Revolution. Her tears are discreet, the rules are very formal there. Capable of conveying such intensity with so much restraint: it is in this vignette, Time for Freedom, that I had the revelation what a great actress is Shu Qi.

Another masterpiece of Hou comes in mind: Flowers of Shanghai. But, not only that one: Dust in the Wind tells a love story destroyed by indifferent times; and all his movies from the 1990's (The Puppetmaster for instance, or A City of Sadness) find somehow in this vignette their starting point, because Time for Freedom is situated in the point of departure for modern Taiwan's history, that 1911 when in Mainland China the Revolution was proclaiming the Republic, while in Taiwan, independence as well as woman dignity were still dreams.

Hou Hsiao-Hsien decided to make this vignette in a silent movie format. He had some reasons: first of all, the Taiwanese dialect spoken by 1911 would have been incomprehensible for today's Chinese viewers (as full as it was of archaic regionalisms amalgamated with Japanese words). There was also another reason, I think: the ascetic restraint that Hou used for this vignette, to avoid any cheap pathetic. The story is running in a brothel, yet it is of great distinction. One more note only would have spoiled the whole.

From 1911 we travel forward, up to our time. The third vignette is taking place in 2005. Despite their radical differences, Mainland China and Taiwan are now in many ways in sync: similar values shared by common people; similar look and feel in the cities; not too distant approaches in the economics. The most obvious similarity is in the youth's behavior: they are at last their own masters.

The plot in this vignette (Time for Youth) seems chaotic. The old way of sending elaborate love letters is now superfluous, as we have eMail and SMS: you can express yourself directly and get what you want. He works in a digital photographic shop. During the day he runs on his motorcycle on the highways of Taipei (the guy from 1966 was using a bicycle, by the way). She sings in underground clubs, where he spends his nights to take shots. They meet by chance and make passionate sex the following day. He is torn between her and his own girlfriend. She is a bisexual, torn between him and her own female partner.

Actually in all this hectic amalgam of digital photos, techno music, night life, sex and sexual orientation, rides on motorcycle, rapid conversation on SMS, there is something that they are doing while being unaware of it: a search for a sense. Now the country found its identity, its sense, and they are free of any restraint. It is time for them to discover their own selves.

And here comes another great image created by the cameraman Lee Pin-Bing in plays of mirrors and ambiguous identities.

Of course, Millennium Mambo comes in mind immediately, for all the fans of Hou's movies (it is also the same actress, Shu Qi). But, as in the second vignette, there's not only one movie echoed here. This chaotic universe is also in Goodbye, South, Goodbye, and in the contemporary sequences of Good Men, Good Women as well.

Many critics of Hou's movies consider that he is very skeptical about the young generation. I don't think so.

Hou Hsiao-Hsien has actually a special empathy for these young people on the brink. For him, I think, the mundane is the best way to understand the present; maybe because mundane is devoid of any rhetoric.

The lack of horizon is not their fault. It is life that offers no horizons. At the end of Millennium Mambo, Vicky (the personage interpreted by Shu Qi) realizes that we live in the country of snowmen: we built our dreams in the snow, unaware that they will melt down.

Living in a perpetual carpe diem is just natural: the lead female character from Time for Youth suffers from epilepsy, along with all kind of other health issues (it seems that Hou depicted here the real case of a young singer who eventually died; it is anyway a symbol for the fragility of our times). An SMS from her says, there is no past, no future, only a hungry present.

So, arriving at the end of this movie, it is like we arrive at the end of history, just to realize that history was just an illusion.

So, what is Three Times about? Is it about love in various moments of history? Or is it more about history itself? And why don't the three episodes come chronologically?

Actually Three Times is a reflection of Hou Hsiao-Hsien on his own movies, and through them on his own life. He made his movies to answer his questions: the answers and the questions of his generation, of my generation.

When I started to read about Hou Hsiao-Hsien, before watching any of his movies, only reading about them, I was asking myself what I was looking for. Was I in quest for his answers to discover through them my own answers? The answers of my generation? Of my time?

And with each of his movies, I was realizing that he was making them just to understand, to find the answer, or to free himself of some too overwhelming inner truth.

As a young man, he was trying to find the answer for questions put by mother nature. Does she love me? Does he love me? What is love?

As years were passing, other questions became obvious. He was realizing more and more that his search was for identity. To find it you need a larger context: the space of history.

And years kept on passing, a new generation came to the age of love, and then another one, and he realized that the answer had to be found through them. Was it love? Well, love looked very different now. Was it history? Well, the past was of no more interest.

What was the aim of their search (even if they were not aware)? And he realized that they were looking for a sense: for that particular moment, essential in their lives.

Aisareru isshun ga watashi no subete ni naru: the moment you feel that you are loved is a kernel that grasps all your life (I looked a lot to find the translation, it came from a friend, Mr. Larsen).

Three Times: the correct translation from Chinese is The Best Times. The time you feel that it grasps everything, it explains all. Is it to be found by you? In love? In history? In the future?

And here's what he found: we live in the country of snowmen; so times of our life and times of history are just snowmen, nothing more.",1421798400,3,9785,4.5763293310463125
