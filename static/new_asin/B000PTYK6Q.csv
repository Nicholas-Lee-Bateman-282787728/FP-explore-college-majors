2828068,4,B000PTYK6Q,"As Curator of a Bigfoot Discovery Museum in Central California--someone who has probably viewed just about every film or documentary ever done on bigfoot--I can say with impunity that this is one of the best. I was stunned to learn that this is a low-budget, home-made video, as it comes across as professionally done. Even the home-made bigfoot suit used for the ""dramatic recreations"" of sightings holds up as well as most professionally-made costumes. The video starts with videographer Todd Partain's own bigfoot encounter as told by various members of his family, who were also there for the event. He goes on to interview a cross-section of witnesses, field researchers and authors which does a better than usual job of convincing the viewer that this mystery primate might actually exist. Definitely worth a look, especially if you want to convince your skeptical friends and relatives that people do indeed see bigfoot.

2828069,5,B000PTYK6Q,"It is so refreshing to view a DVD and see eye-witness accounts that are not only being retold by the actual witness but also have a re-enactment to go along with it. I really liked the interviews with Rick Noll but especially the one with Scott Herriott.

But perhaps even more interesting is Todd's own experience. It sent chills up and down my spine as I watched and the sheer terror of that eventful night definitely makes me think twice about living anywhere near the woods.

Very informative video and a must have for a ""bigfooters"" home movie collection.",1177804800,,560,4.646464646464646
2828070,5,B000PTYK6Q,Great documentary!  I loved the realistic recreations with the man in the suit.  Excellent interviews with witness's and footage of actual encounters.  Great addition to your bigfoot dvd collection.,1177718400,2,198,5.758620689655173
2828071,1,B000PTYK6Q,"The DVD does not play.  Upon inserting into a DVD player it goes to a ""main menu"" screen.  However, when you attempt to play it, it does nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  How do I return it for a refund?",1217376000,,200,4.184210526315789
2828072,2,B000PTYK6Q,"Some good moments, but over all a lack luster production and effort compared to other Bigfoot videos to be seen and owned. If you are new to the subject and want a good jump start on bigfoot info, I would start elsewhere on higher rated videos. If you own it all already and this is your last bigfoot video, then by all means pick it up. Just OK. Not bad but certainly not great.",1217289600,,379,4.135135135135135
2828073,3,B000PTYK6Q,"If it wasn't for the fact that the DVD is about Bigfoot, it wouldn't be worth the buy. The DVD has poor sound quality and effects that should make you laugh...not what I expected for the price. Don't expect anything from the title either... It sounded like a great Bigfoot DVD I could turn the lights off to and get creeped out! Not the case. On the upside, the DVD contains some great ""first encounter"" stories from folks who claim to have seen Bigfoot. If you're a true Bigfoot fan, take the plunge and buy it. Don't expect too much!",1203552000,,535,4.36
2828074,5,B000PTYK6Q,"This is a new documentary produced and directed by Todd Partain and his family, and it's a great one. It features Todd's story, as well as the testimonials of Bob Strain, Scott Herriott, Mike Hall and Richard Noll and their experiences. There are recreations (very professionally done) of each story, including the Skookum Cast incident. The recreation actor is also very good, the one in the Sasquatch costume. Dr. Linda Brent, a primatologist is also interviewed about her views on the Sasquatch phenomenon. It is quite a professional and well-done documentary, and highly-recommended. 5 out of 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1198540800,6,624,5.377551020408164
2828075,1,B000PTYK6Q,"Todd, Thanks for the refund offer, but I won't remove this review. It is a warning to others not to buy your documentary BECAUSE I think it stinks! In response to your angry rambling comment on my review: If this is what you call doing something ""above and beyond"" you apparently have very low standards which was obvious to me after watching your documentary.  REVIEW: Everyone appears to be talking about an experience they WISH they had had. And what about the guy that went on and on about the film he and his friend made, where was the footage????? I think alot of these people are lying. Partain must have gotten some family members and pals to write in some good reviews because this is a really lame duck documentary. The bigfoot suit in this film looked terrible! I've seen hoaxes of bifoot pics that where more convincing.  My personal opinion and advise is to save your money. I wasted 20.00 on this stink bomb.",1191974400,3,922,4.548192771084337
2828076,2,B000PTYK6Q,"If you are a Sasquatch researcher I could imagine this documentary to be pretty interesting, but for the average curious layperson like me it was pretty boring - just a bunch of interviews.  Yawn!",1188086400,2,196,4.764705882352941
2828077,5,B000PTYK6Q,"Being a Sasquatch researcher and writer I am always looking into films and documentaries about the Bigfoot mystery.  Often times documentaries are rehashed theories, tired unsuccessful methods of tracking and arguments.  Imagine my surprise when I wathced Todd Partain's ""Eyes in the Dark,""  Finally a breath of fresh air in the realm of Cine du Sasquatch!  Todd gives an excellent collection of accounts from a variety of witnesses and gives us, the viewer, something we often aren't treated to in a Bigfoot piece...great re-enactments of the stories being told!  Kudos, Todd, and anyone else on a job well done!  Even though this is a small independently produced film this by far surpases many of the documentaries with an actual budget being shown on stations such as Discovery, History and others.  And as a special treat we get a brief and humorous ""behinds the scenes"" look at Todd's buddy reluctantly transforming from man to beast.  Shows what a true friend will endure for a pal!  Todd, if you plan on future films let me know.  You've made a fan!",1182902400,14,1057,4.887640449438202
2828078,4,B000PTYK6Q,"Being a bigfoot junkie, I watch all kinds of programs and read all kinds of books on the subject of sasquatch. John Partain puts out this independently produced/directed documentary that stemmed from an experience of his family. It appears that the Partains attended one of the Texas Bigfoot Conventions to do these interviews. There are 5 or so tellings of encounters with the top profile one being Scott Herriott's, who with Darryl Owen (not positive that's his last name), expedition ended up with purported video footage of a sasquatch in the bushes (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Squatching-Journey-Toward-Squatchdom/dp/B0009VNHAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Squatching/Journey Toward Squatchdom</a>&nbsp;dvd put out by Herriott). The rapid cuts on this interview segment takes something away from it and you get distracted by the cuts. The other perk of this dvd is an interview with ""The Bigfoot Hunter"" Richard Noll who has put much personal time into this phenomenon but doesn't ever seem to crave any spotlight. He's been around for decades, involved in bigfoot research, and rarely is seen on camera. It's always good to get more encounter stories and it's a good addition to my collection.

Onto the dvd itself... What you get is approx. 50 minutes of documentary containing 5 or so interviews. Then there's the 'behind the scenes' segment which is a 5 minute piece with the Partain children talking and how Partain's friend Tiger was willing to ""play"" sasquatch. The suit they made isn't the best when seen in this segment but during the actual program it looks pretty good; there's definitely less effort put into other costumes for these kinds of projects and this costume is even better than some that make it into low budget B-movies. This is an independently made dvd of decent quality if somewhat short on running time. The menu is extremely basic and could have looked much better with a little effort in that department. While I'm not as gungho about this dvd as some of the other reviewers, it is certainly worth putting in your collection and watching repeatedly.",1179878400,9,2134,5.332344213649852
2828079,5,B000PTYK6Q,"This is one of the best bigfoot/sasquatch documentaries out there.  Todd Partain did a wonderful job putting it together, and all of the witnesses interviewed seem credible and well-spoken.  Todd's own experience is what led him to undertake this project, and the result is obviously a top-notch effort.",1178150400,2,303,5.291666666666667
2828080,5,B000PTYK6Q,"I received my copy of filmaker Todd Partains Sasquatch documentary and have watched it 3 times already. The Interviews are very compelling, informative and very credible in my opinion. He autographed my copy, and I hope he makes more as this documentary was very well done and was helpful to my research as I have been studying these creatures/mystery for close to 30 years. I had the opportunity to hear him on The Sasquatch Experience Radio show and he is one of the nicest, humblest researchers out there,&who really knows his subject matter well. I highly recommend this to all Bigfoot researchers.",1177804800,4,602,4.911764705882353
8193263,5,B000PTYK6Q,"Yes it ,ay not have the big production quality, but I think Todd did a pretty good job.  He even secured some actual film from the error to shoot with instead of just using a gopro.  For the amount of obvious effort and care he put into this project I think it deserves some credit.  But if you aren't into people getting off the couch and actually putting all the effort into making a project like this, then stay on the couch and write some reviews.
Thank you Todd for a great film.",1470441600,,484,4.182795698924731
8193264,3,B000PTYK6Q,"This relatively short documentary features accounts of Bigfoot encounters and findings by several dedicated Bigfoot hunters  plus some thoughts from famed cryptozoologist Loren Coleman.  The impetus for the video was producer/director Todd Partains own encounter with the legendary creature.  As a young child, he  along with his mother and brother  were terrorized by a large, red-eyed creature who tried to get in their trailer, putting holes in the front steps and damaging the buildings exterior.  We hear that whole story in the words of Partain, his parents, and his brother.  The Bigfoot researchers interviewed here are not yokels who go around saying I do think theres a squatch in these woods every time they enter a forest; they are experienced and dedicated men, several of whom have published books on the subject.  Unfortunately, some of their stories are accompanied by recreations  and not very reliable ones.  The recreation of a close-up encounter described by Scott Herriott and his buddy Daryl Owen looks very impressive  Ive seen the original video, however, and I cant really see any sort of creature whatsoever in the footage.  As far as Im concerned, this damages the credibility of this entire documentary.",1433548800,,1231,5.224489795918367
8193265,3,B000PTYK6Q,It was okay.,1426982400,,12,3.3333333333333335
8193266,3,B000PTYK6Q,The movie is ok but I wasn't sure what to make of it. It was very entertaining just the same.,1389571200,,93,3.7
8193267,5,B000PTYK6Q,"This is one of the better documentaries I have seen. This was a recommendation from Monster Man ""Scot Man"" and once again, he was right. (The first was Mysterious Monsters, another great long lost gem.) This is an independent documentary that has a few recreations that are woven into some little known encounters. The filmmaker shares a family encounter at Caddo Lake that is one of the scariest stories I have ever heard. Other researchers and some experts are interviewed who offer comments, but it is the encounters from some of the researchers that is the heart of this DVD. Several of the researchers had frightening experiences and too close encounters that I had not heard of. Their stories are worth hearing. There is a behind the scenes segment with a friend who volunteered to be Bigfoot for the re-enactments and that shows what friends will do for friends. Unfortunately, my copy had some transfer problems, every 10-15 minutes, the disc stops and will start again a few minutes before the spot it froze on which is annoying. Hopefully future transfers won't have this problem. This is a great DVD if you would like to hear some stories that go beyond the usual I saw something at a distance. Most of these encounters were too close for comfort and several were chased off. I think this is a great addition to a collection for Bigfoot fans.",1332460800,,1353,4.737288135593221
8193268,2,B000PTYK6Q,Slightly interesting but not much else. No footage at all just interviewing witnesses and some comical recreations of witness accounts.,1331596800,,135,5.8
8193269,1,B000PTYK6Q,This is just a collection of stories from questionable witnesses; nothing for the serious researcher here.  The DVD I received kept locking up and had to be restarted.  Save your money and pass on this one!,1309219200,,206,4.694444444444445
8193270,5,B000PTYK6Q,"I've owned this DVD for a couple of years and it remains a favorite in my collection. Yes it contains many recreations and makes for entertaining viewing for sasquatch enthusists & curiousity seekers alike. Some of the reviews are critical of the lack of effects of the creature, but do not let that convince you to look away from this fine disc. Todd's production values & thought about this project speak volumes about what you are watching. I wish big budgeted projects had a fraction of the soul that this does. I had received a couple of emails from Todd after I purchased this and my only ""complaint"" is that he didn't re-create his trailer sighting (HEY TODD - PART 2?)

Forget the low reviews (especially the douche who thanks him for the refund and then immaturely writes the 1 star review - especially since it was obvious that he left it well after the refund took place.) Feel comfortable that this will be a welcome addition to your collection or a nice gift for someone.",1268784000,,984,4.590909090909091
8193271,4,B000PTYK6Q,"Before I purchased ""Eyes In The Dark"", I wasn't really sure what to expect. A couple of the people who reviewed it here panned it and other said it was better than larger-budgeted Sasquatch Documentaries.

When I started watching it, I was immediately impressed with what Mr. Partain did with a meager budget. The eyewitnesses and Sasquatch Experts he assembled were very well done. The reenactments of the witnesses' encounters were well done.

I would have liked to have heard more about Mr. Portain's family encounter, though. I can imagine it was terrifying.

""Eyes In The Dark"" is a welcome addition to my Sasquatch DVD Collection!",1257897600,,636,4.981132075471698
8193272,2,B000PTYK6Q,"Im a bigfoot fan, but this movie was very boring, very disappointed. The interviews might have actually been interesting alone if they had left out the cheaply done video of ""bigfoot"" that was of course fake and looked very much so. Also in one interview the guy claimed to have video taped this ""thing"" in heavy brush, well where's that video? If thats true why wasn't shots of his video in this it would have made I BIG difference. It doesnt come close to ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" now thats a movie at least it looked real enough to believe. Nice try though, gave two stars for effort.",1233532800,,586,4.435185185185185
