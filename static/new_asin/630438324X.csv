7869182,5,630438324X,"George Sanders one of my favorite actors but I got this years ago because of Bela Lugosi who I have almost every thing I can find
with him in it. Sanders was great in Lured with Lucille Ball and Boris Karloff if you haven't seen it. This is a great double feature of
The Saint series and you get Bela Lugosi as a tough mobster in the second movie but he's not in enough scenes for me. How could
they waste his screen presence and talent? Anyway the movies are great mystery film noir spy type movies if you enjoy those and
George Sanders is as smooth and suave and cunning as The Saint. Roger Moore played him pretty close but Sanders the original.",1433808000,,648,4.233870967741935

7869184,4,630438324X,The London film is classic Sanders and likely the most beautiful and clever of his female co-stars.  Double Trouble sports the favorite vampire of old.  You'll like both of these!,1387238400,,179,4.933333333333334
7869185,4,630438324X,"George Saunders made a great ""Saint"". In the books The Saint is fearless, amusing, witty, and smarter than everyone else around. In these movies, Saunders' performances come across solidly with those traits. The movies also do a good job of capturing the spirit of the Saint's adventures, which generally involve a great deal of money and one or more murders. The Saint generally moves thru his adventures with a casual disregard for danger ... walking knowingly into rooms full of enemies, depending on his wits and his skills to walk out again.

These movies are for fans of sophisticated and subtle comedies, as even though Saint movies are somewhat adventurous, the best parts are when The Saint is making comments aside that are quite amusing if you are paying close attention.

As much as I like these movies, I wouldn't consider paying the prices I see on these old VHS tapes. Keep an eye out on TCM, where they occasionally play them in a day long marathon. DVR them and then watch them at your leisure. Most of the films are barely over an hour long, so you won't use up too much space even if you keep the entire collection saved for a while.",1289952000,,1152,4.614634146341463
7869186,4,630438324X,"The Saint in London was a nice surprise for me.  I enjoy these early light hearted detective movies and the Saint did not disappoint me.  George Sanders looked the part of a sophisticated, but rugged hero.  He is wealthy, but he easily engages people of every social status.  The give and take with the female hero was much like the Thin Man series that I understand proceeded this film.  The Saint, though, is not made for marriage for which he makes clear to his girlfriend.  He is the stereotypic ""Man's Man""  and this is a classic Saturday afternoon movie.",1195084800,5,560,4.595959595959596
7869187,3,630438324X,"I soon found out that I much prefer George Sanders over the foppish Roger Moore, the tv Saint, 30 years later. An amusing little movie featuring some smart banter between The Saint & his young attractive admirer, Penny Parker (Sally Gray)who helps him solve the crime. She'd jump his bones in a minute but he's too much a gentleman for that. Most of the other members of the cast are rich, idle drones, without much to say. The slight plot is a theft of foreign currency & a murder to be solved. But the best part is the flirtatious dialogue between Penny &  Simon Templar (The Saint). Diverting...entertaining, in pre-war London.",1169683200,7,630,4.675675675675675
7869188,4,630438324X,"THE SAINT IN LONDON was  filmed on location in London. The movie was about the attempted theft of foreign currency and it was based on the novel THE MILLION POUND DAY by Leslie Charteris. George Sanders had the role of Simon Templar. The cast included Sally Gray and David Burns.
THE SAINT'S DOUBLE TROUBLE was released in 1940. This movie was about a gang of diamond smugglers in Philadelphia. George Sanders again played the part of Templar. The supporting cast included Bela Lugosi.",1049328000,12,485,4.843373493975903
