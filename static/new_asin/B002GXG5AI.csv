8370081,5,B002GXG5AI,"Happiness 101 is a PBS presentation that features Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard University lecturer. On this DVD you will find all the basic ways to reach a state of happiness. This is really about the science of happiness or what has been discovered by the positive psychology movement. If you are searching for emotional equanimity this has a lot of good ideas you can put into practice right away. Some of the interesting things I learned include how to be more creative and productive. Working harder and longer is not the answer. In fact taking breaks works better.

One thing Tal Ben-Shahar talks about is how we have to accept the negative emotions along with the positive ones. He emphasizes that we should be kind to ourselves and accept that we are human. My only disagreement would be that you can advance to the stage where emotionally you are no longer bothered by anger or other negative emotions. You can train yourself not to react so harshly to things. And I like that he says we basically don't have to act out our negative emotions, like envy, etc.

What this DVD does present is ideas for how we can work with nature and how real change comes only with actions.

I found Tal Ben-Shahar to be very funny and I got his dry sense of humor. He had me laughing along with the audience. I'm definitely glad I watched this and can recommend it to anyone who wants to find more joy in life.

One note about meditation however - I only suggest non religious meditation.

8370083,5,B002GXG5AI,"I could not be more grateful to Tal Ben-Shahar for using his vast knowledge, amusing examples and summation of numerous scientific studies to help others!  I purchased this dvd after my absolute love, roommate and best friend moved out, two days later i was laid off.  Life was far from where i ever imagined being at 43.  single, heart broken, no job, no income and in a truly horrible place.

I know there are no accidents in life and in the end - things have a way of working themselves out for the best. I played this dvd (while multitasking - thus not giving it my full attention) and noticed that i kept hitting rewind.  Then out of a mutual respect for myself and this dvd, i moved the pile of crap that was taking my attention away from being in the moment, closed my laptop, got a drink, turned off all the lights and decided to start it from the beginning without letting myself be distracted.

Now it's been in my dvd player for two-days and on my coffee table is a large pad of blank paper and a pen. Today i decided to share this film with my social network (facebook ,etc.) and believe this SHOULD BE MANDATORY viewing in our schools and for EVERYONE in a horrible place not knowing how to get out of their funk/depressed state.  Additionally, I promised all of my friends that I would summarize his bullet points (thus the reason for my notepad) and send it to them.  Since I am a visual person - this little task is the best way for me to remember his prescription for happiness 101; all of which are backed by medical research and common sense; and then i plan to hang it in a prominent place as a daily reminder.

I truly believe his findings to be life changing and wish i could give him an enormous bear hug!  Americans are medicated in order to get through our daily lives.  We are more stressed out and unhappy than ever before.  Technology is useful, but also a major cause for our inability to live in the moment.",1365811200,6,1937,4.335180055401662
8370084,5,B002GXG5AI,"I just finished watching this DVD and I loved it!  The presenter's self-effacing, humorous manner made a scientific/academic subject very accessible.  I found him to be charming and genuinely interested in helping those of us who struggle at times with stress, frustration, or depression.  And who doesn't?  Though I know that the DVD presentation was the tip of the iceberg in terms of his and others' (some of whom appear in the DVD) research into mindfulness, meditation, and stress management, I not only left with an enormous curiosity about the rest of his work, but with real techniques to put into action today.  Two of his recommendations - meditation and physical exercise - were very easy to incorporate into my routine, and I am excited to continue on this path.  On a rainy, gloomy day in the midst of the holiday craziness, when I woke up with a bad cold and have a million things on my ""To Do"" list, that's really saying something.  Highly recommended.",1355011200,3,967,4.789156626506024
8370085,5,B002GXG5AI,"Tal Ben-Shahar presents a 70-minute overview of the topic of ""positive psychology"" which is a growing field of study within the field of psychology. While this video is presented by a Harvard professor, it is geared toward a general, non-science audience and it packs a lot of great information into a short period regarding what it takes for people to be happy even when dealing with the challenges of life. Everyone can gain insight from this presentation. Ben-Shahar offers practical advice with scientific research to back it up. The theory of positive pyschology is ""founded on the belief that people want to lead meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is best within themselves, and to enhance their experiences of love, work, and play."" (Penn University) It's completely within reach.

This isn't pop psychology; it's science.",1327363200,,845,5.213235294117647
8370086,5,B002GXG5AI,"Well I have not read his book, but after reading the comment above which gave a low rating to the dvd, I think I should.  That's because I thought the DVD was super, and if a previous commenter said the Book is better, well I just may get it.  I got to see the DVD (over a period of about four 20 minute sessions the past 3 wks) as part of some staff training.  Actually, I thought Tal was an excellent presenter, and the DVD is studio quality.  He was engaging, spoke eloquently, respectfully, had a gentle persona, easy voice to listen to, made practical suggestions, and included a few audiovisuals to re-inforce the topic.  Yes, it's no movie and not an entertainment piece, but to say it's ""boring"" is absolutely not true.  If an individual is feeling, or a company has Staff who are feeling stressed, depressed, anxious, or burned out, I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD!",1274313600,14,872,4.522292993630574
8370087,5,B002GXG5AI,"I have studied all the inspirational books and videos I could get my hands on over the years. By far this one is the best. It's simple, easy to understand, remember and practice. If someone is too busy to read the book, this DVD is the answer. I can assure you that you will be a much better person if you apply the simple steps covered here.",1272153600,2,342,4.119402985074627
8370088,5,B002GXG5AI,"It is easy to see how this was the most popular class at Harvard. It is not all that common that information as solid and useful as this is presented with such genuine compassion and charm. I have read many  books and heard many lectures on the subject and this is easily one of the very best offerings in the field. Excellent in technical quality, content and presentation. A genuine gift to us all, my heartfelt thanks to the author/presenter.",1268092800,8,445,4.5625
8370089,1,B002GXG5AI,"Tal Ben-Shahar's book, Happiness, is wonderful. It's filled with helpful information and actual 'trick's' you can use to increase your level of happiness. In the era of positive psychology it is well worth your time to read, if you haven't done so already. My expectation was that the DVD would expand upon the book and offer new and different information. Unfortunately, the DVD was a major disappointment. It is about 40 minutes long (with a 15 minute counseling session tacked on at the end); basicially, Ben-Shahar highlights 5 or so points from his book and talks about them to a small audience. His writing is far better than his speaking ability - I found him to be a really boring presenter and was glad I'd read the book first. The DVD was pointless, to be honest. It doesn't offer the same insights as the book and it doesn't come across as helpful, informative or interesting. It would have been a better idea to have him put his book on audio CD for people to listen to. Watching him and listening to him wasn't good at all.",1262217600,33,1036,4.575268817204301
