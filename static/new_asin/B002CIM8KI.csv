8363994,4,B002CIM8KI,"Page Hamilton's instructional video ""Sonic Shapes"" (published by Hal Leonard) is clear in quality and firm in its content. Hamilton takes his jazz background and develops unique tones and note voicings not typical in rock music and, as a result, not typical in rock-based video instruction. He defies the listeners to train one's fingers and brain to play what is heard, as well as concepts to help break a person free from practice and playing habits. If you're looking for the ""non-traditional,"" this video packs a very nice punch

This instructional DVD comprises five different sections, besides the four band performances at the end (which ties in the various ideas Hamilton puts forth). It begins with Scales, which may seem boring and redundant to many guitarists, but Hamilton really uncovers some unique and likely unchartered territory for many of us. He explains how to work in a ""modal"" manner with scale tones (to develop music ideas in a ""linear"" fashion) rather than ""vertically"" with typical scale changes. This produces music with a lot of tension, which then is pushed to a unique limit with the inclusion of whole scale, diminished scale and alternate diminished scale applications and to produce polytonal harmonies. (If some of the terms or concepts seem foreign or beyond your theory comprehension, Hamilton does demonstrate these concepts on the guitar so effectively that even a novice will grasp the ideas).

Hamilton then moves into his Sonic Chord Shapes, with altered chords to create unique voicings, which anyone can discover by taking a basic chord and moving the fingers around to see what sounds the different note changes produce (this is an example of not having to know any music theory in order to experiment and have fun). The second aspect to this video segment is how to take a common tone or note among various chords while keeping that note constant (this produces a linear sound based on pedal points, e.g., always hearing an ""A"" note, although different chords are playing over that ""A"").

The third and fourth sections deal with practicing and listening. Not only do you hear and try to emulate by way of your own creations or interpretations, but Hamilton addresses the value of random note playing and understanding tonal relationships (and discovering unique note combinations based on that randomness).

The final instructional section is the fun part, whereby Hamilton addresses the use of guitar effects to create unusual soundscapes that are far from the traditional, although the pedals/effects are typical.

Page Hamilton may not be a natural when it comes to speaking to a camera, but his points and instruction are clear and concise. Simple ideas like ""learn a new chord and try to build a song around it"" can take any guitarist far, or even ""share anything new you learn with another guitarist to solidify the learning process"" almost seems like a no-brainer after you hear it. But it's little gems like those that can make a difference. Hamilton is a firm believer in learning new things, to expand his vocabulary in order to break free of his current abilities (habits) and Hal Leonard produced an excellent video with this in mind.

With Page Hamilton's work on Helmet compositions, the ideas in this video demonstrate clearly his unique ability to reach for that uncommon chord and scale to produce both unusual and unconventional sounds and harmonies. Most instructional videos may offer new insights, but often when dealing with similar scales, chords and progressions. Conversely, Hamilton's distinctive take on music is what gives the band Helmet its matchless sound, and many of his ideas to do just that are presented well in this video. If you are looking for fresh ideas, this video is worth the investment.",1424304000,,3776,5.043269230769231
8363995,3,B002CIM8KI,"I was really excited to see that an instructional DVD from Page Hamilton had become available - - - Page has such an interesting pedigree as a guitarist.  Jazz Studies, work with avant garde composer Glenn Branca, Thinking man's metal with Helmet, Bowie sideman, soundtrack work --- He brings so many things to the table and he is clearly an intelligent and thoughtful guy, if a bit stiff in his presentation.

I think the most interesting aspect of this is his ideas about practicing.  He is into the work of Howard Roberts whose student Gary Hagberg, he studied with in college.  He brings up Roberts' book ""Super Chops"" and compellingly but a bit incompletely talks about his way of adjusting the basic ideas of the book to form his practice regimen; he doesn't really explain enough, though, and ""Super Chops"" is sadly out of print and expensive on the used market.  There are some places on the web where one can obtain a scanned pdf version of this work; however.  I think it is great how Page credits his teachers and influences and shows how serious guitar skills don't develop in a vacuum.

I think this is a decent, if shallow, introduction to some aspects of guitar playing that are important to Page but in the end I think one is left feeling that it is incomplete.  Page is not just your average star guitarist putting together the obligatory instructional DVD.  He has made a serious study of the guitar and has a depth of experience that is mostly skimmed over in this.

I would love to see Page develop a series of dvds and printed instructional materials.  I think he has the depth and breadth to develop a program of study that could be unique.  It would be great if he could do an updating of the ""Super Chops"" concept with an updated course of study showing his own learning system in enough detail so the student could set up a regimen of his/her own.

I'm impressed by this but mostly in what it points to not so much in what it is able to include itself.

I would recommend this but only if you are a serious student of the guitar ready to do some work.  I think someone looking for a comprehensive system will find this compelling but not enough.  The casual dabbler and those looking for some cool licks will be seriously disappointed as this will not, for the most part, deliver for them.

I'd give it 3.5 stars.  5 if this could be an intro to a more complete system developed by Page in the future.
