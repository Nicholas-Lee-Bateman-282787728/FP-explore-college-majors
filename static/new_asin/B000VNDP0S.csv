8219508,4,B000VNDP0S,"This is a Special Bonus DVD and includes:

The story behind 'The Altar and the Door'
'Praise You in the Storm' Live concert footage
'Does Anybody Here Her' music video
Meet Casting Crowns
Voice of Truth (Mark's testimony)

If you are a Casting Crowns fan this is a great DVD to own in addition to their 'The Altar and the Door' live CD and DVD.

The 'Does Anybody Here Her' video on this DVD was very beautifully done and very convicting.

The Meet Casting Crowns section was very interesting and fun as the band shares a little of their personal lives with the camera.

The story behind 'The Altar and the Door' was also very interesting.  It's always neat to know how a song comes to be.

My favorite part of this DVD and the reason I purchased it to begin with was Mark's testimony.  He talks about how God brought him from where he began as a dyslexic and ADHD child to where he is today and he does so in a live concert setting.

My son, daughter and husband are all dyslexic and Mark's testimony was very encouraging to all of us.  The bottom line of Mark's testimony was how God doesn't need any of us but He wants each of us.  We just have to want Him to be able to be used by Him.  It was a very powerful message.

Although, it does stop rather abruptly as he prepares to sing a song at the end of his testimony.  I wish they would have included the song.  Other than that, this DVD was excellent.

Also the price was reasonable for what you get at under six dollars.",1319500800,9,1476,4.199288256227758
