2828650,5,B000PWQPAM,"I bought this dvd set cause it carries a peculiar but famous name...DEGRASSI. I've never known that The kids of the Degrassi Street ever existed till I saw the pre-order release, & though it is not as controversial as Degrassi Junior High or Degrassi High it keeps you wondering who's the next lead character on the next storyline, though in the first 3 episodes you'll be under the impression that IDA was going to be the main character of the series,though later on you will see her but grown a teenager.
This series has a different approach to a different audience...a general one to be exact. It's a family show concentrated on kid's life!! & believe me I do relate to a few episodes though i'm in my 30's now,but it took me back when I was a kid & relive what the characters of The Degrassi Street was portraying. To think that it started filming on 1979 till 1984 cause you'll get to see the unexpected growth of most of the characters between stories,like I mentioned about IDA.
All in all this first DEGRASSI series is pure innocense, entertaining & very open to any audience to understand what our kids back then & today go through in their own tiny world.",1188432000,11,1165,4.5
2828651,5,B000PWQPAM,"I grew up watching The Kids of Degrassi Street!  I watched it on 35mm projector at our local library ( Friday Nights) I'm not sure why I never saw them at home.  But, when you grow up and remember the ""good old days"" The Kids of Degrassi Street are it!  Now that I'm trying to increase storage space...I've been waiting for a DVD release!  Yeah.  I can't wait until the box makes it to my mail box! Then I shall donate the VHS to my local hospital!  I think the kids here will enjoy watching them.  ( Even though they are about kids from another generation and another country)",1185926400,13,577,4.238532110091743
2828652,4,B000PWQPAM,"This is a cool dvd to have.  More boring than Junior High and High, which are good and classics.  Nonetheless, it's cool to have the before.",1406592000,,140,4.346153846153846
2828653,5,B000PWQPAM,"I grew up watching this show and have always loved it. Re-watching these episodes so far have been super fun and I've always loved the lessons learned. I'm the sort of dork that loves After School Specials type shows and Degrassi is by far the best one, I've ever come across. It touches on so many issues that kids go through, even in todays day and age. Not to mention how fun it is to watch these kids grow up and some even continue on to further seasons as adults. I highly recommend it for your kids, it teaches some great values and they might just learn from them. I know, I did. It's fun for parents too. It is a show you can definitely watch with your kids.",1404691200,,666,4.170542635658915
2828654,5,B000PWQPAM,"there was nothing wrong with it.  It arrived in tact, has been working fine.  I recommend this to people.  (It's actually not a chick flick :P)",1377561600,,143,4.423076923076923

2828657,5,B000PWQPAM,"If you are reading this chances are you are familiar with Degrassi. Now if you are why are you even debating whether to buy the Kids Of Degrassi Street or not!? It's a no brainer, BUY IT!",1357516800,,187,4.081081081081081
2828658,5,B000PWQPAM,"If you watch Degrassi, you've got to have this for your collection. There are a lot of the same people in it, just with different names. Worth the buy.",1353715200,,151,4.241379310344827

2828660,3,B000PWQPAM,"Overall I rate this program a ""1"" for the first half which I found rather simplistic, and a ""4"" for the second half which comes close to Degrassi Junior High's greatness.  When you start watching this show, you'll probably recognize nothing familiar.  The earliest episodes are from the 1970s when the kids were barely 3 or 4 years old, and these storylines often play like a Little Rascals skit.  i.e.  Stories about lemonade stands, teddy bears, and such.

The plots improve dramatically in later seasons.  Some familiar faces appear from the Degrassi Junior High show, but they are not playing the same roles.  For example the character known as ""Wheels"" has a completely different name and storyline in Kids of Degrassi Street.

One interesting thing is the final episode, where the kids celebrate graduation from elementary to junior high.  At this point the ""Street"" show most resembles the famous Degrassi Junior High program, and it is easy to imagine you are watching the ""lost"" 6th grade episodes, which laid the foundation for the Junior High and Degrassi High programs.",1230508800,5,1081,4.994413407821229
2828661,5,B000PWQPAM,"It has been many years since I have seen an episode of The Kids of Degrassi Street, but after hearing the opening theme music it definitely took me back to my childhood.  I grew up in the suburbs that surrounded Toronto  and had cousins who lived very close to the actual Degrassi St.  (yes it does exist), so it was fun to see all the landmarks that I have actually visited in my life.

The show is wonderful and wholesome with an excellent message for children of all ages to learn.  Even though this show was shot from the late 1970s to the middle 1980s I think all the messages are still relevant to today's youth.  There are many characters that come and go in the series, but there are a small group that stick around for a majority of the episodes (most of these characters show up in Degrassi Jr High with different names).

The quality of the episodes get better as the show progressed (thats a given), so I have no complaints about the quality.  Overall I am just happy this set was released and its a must have for any Degrassi nut like myself.  So go buy it!",1207958400,6,1070,4.2835820895522385
8193744,5,B000PWQPAM,"This where it all began. Though not the same characters from DEGRASSI JUNIOR HIGH/ DEGRASSI HIGH, there are the same bottom lines, lesson learned, and tests of social living. Oddly enough, a lot of the featured players here would appear again in the follow-up series. Between you and me, readers, this show is driven by collaboration and not gratification--unlike most projects long after the fact. And hey, it's the 1980s. Time to stop beating around the bush.",1514246400,,461,5.0
8193745,5,B000PWQPAM,Love this show very first Degrassi ever!!! Love the relationship between Griff and Lisa. It is a little slow in the beginning but it does get good!,1484092800,,147,4.481481481481482

8193747,2,B000PWQPAM,It starts out very boring but it does get a little better towards the end. If your thinking you need to watch it due to watching from the beginning of their lives that's a mistake. They completely change their characters in degrassi junior high,1457481600,2,244,4.568181818181818
