8066908,5,B0009UV7F8,This is the final stage of the story in dn angel and when you are finished watching it. It leaves you wanting more out of the story and it feels like none of the questions you had about the characters aren't answered.,1373328000,,217,4.190476190476191

8066911,5,B0009UV7F8,"After returning from the world inside the painting, Daisuke goes back to enjoying his school break. That is until another artifact awakens and threatens to destroy the city. The Black Wings have awakened and it will take Daisuke, Dark, and Satoshi to stop it. This battle may take the lives of Krad, Dark, Satoshi, Saisuke, and everyone they love. The Harada twins are both in love with someone who could very well die in this final battle. Will they both get their lover back, or will they both end up alone? The ending to this story is emotional and very fitting. It's all that I expected from a good series like D.N. Angel.

This series was up and down for me. There were some fairly unimportant episodes in this series. Some of which I liked, and some not so much. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack were all very well done. There were plenty of good characters and dramatic moments; as well as some light hearted comedy. D.N. Angel was a well balanced anime. It was a good clean show that is suitable for almost any age group. I would give it a PG rating. The ending in this series was a solid 5 stars. As a whole though, I have to give it 4. There was more potential here than was actually achieved I think. There was also a lot of wasted time. It was still a very good series though. I recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",1356220800,2,1341,4.342629482071713
8066912,5,B0009UV7F8,This video is great with both sad and happy parts it also helps us understand the real trust that it takes to make a relationship successful. I think this is the best video of the whole series.,1350777600,,193,4.243243243243243
8066913,5,B0009UV7F8,"I'm finding myself pleasantly caught off guard right now. Looking back on this series and knowing what I know now about whom these characters are and what their stories are, I can really appreciate what happened earlier in the series and really take in the gravity of what each event meant.

In the end, the staff took a big chance with this story since there was very little indication that this story was going anywhere for the first half. The staff really had to trust that their audience would stick it out to the end and those of them that did were treated to a great ending. While it did manage to get stuck on a couple of clichs and spots of poor writing, it did its job and gives the audience enough to feel satisfied. Definitely a series that will get a full replay from me at some point in the future and recommended.",1213920000,,827,4.335483870967742
8066914,5,B0009UV7F8,"The entire dnangel serires is amazing i bought every single one aswell as the soundtrack and i'm going to buy the second soundtrack aswell. Dnangel has the greatest storyline, wonderful characters and ontop of that even the extras are great on the dvd's for instance Shunichi Miyamoto is a singer for dnangel and he has cd's of his own after you hear his voice you'll most likely fall pray to what i did( i bought a cd of his) on this website, called For someone needs love, shunichi is the amazing singer who sings the theme song for dnangel aswell as to live shows found on the dvd Caged bird and if i can be with you, they are both amazing and worth much credit. i have never regretted buying the dnangel series nor do i regret buying the soundtracks or shunichi's cd, Dnangel is the most amazing show and quickly became my favourite series. All who read this try it You'll love it!!!! ( oh and from a dnangel fan.....GO Dnangel!!!!!!",1139011200,,937,4.453488372093023
8066915,5,B0009UV7F8,"Well ladies and gentlemen the finale of d.n.angel has finally been released. Most are wonder exactly what happened after krad pulled the wedge of time after the 6th dvd and this just ends it all. I won't say too much otherwise i will spoil this dvd to good fans, but if you must know the ending isn't exactly bad. There were a few scenes where I felt as if there were strong emotions flowing through me, but after that it was just heart warming. We get to see how Krad and Dark were created and learning the truth about the hikari's and the Niwa's deepest secrets. I was satisfied with the ending of how the relationship ends with Daisuke and Riku and as a bonus ill even tell you that there was a slight hint of two special people getting together. Over all this series was just wonderful overall and I recommend this dvd to all those who have previously watched the other 6.",1123804800,11,876,4.347560975609756
