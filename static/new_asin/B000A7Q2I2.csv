2378647,5,B000A7Q2I2,"Kristen Stewart portrayed a credible role as, Melina Sordino. A girl beginning her freshman year in high school, and who is mentally distressed over a tragic event that happened to her the previous summer.  Melina Sordino was date raped at a summer party, left justly terrified and confused; she called the police while at the party. Not telling anyone what really happened, her so called ""friends"" began calling her a snitch and tattle tale for ruining the party. The movie depicts how she begins her freshman year, continuing to be ridiculed by former friends; Melina is left feeling isolated and takes some sort of refuge by allowing herself to associate with a self centered girl she really don't like, as well as occasionally hiding out in an old abandoned janitor's room at school. Melina also finds some acceptance and therapeutic escape within her Art class and teacher, Mr. Freeman, played by Steve Zahn.

The story depicts the emotional impact that comes with such a tragedy, and how Melina finally begins to realize that if she talks about what happened to someone/anyone, she can some how move forward. And even though the plot is strong, the movie mainly focuses on the emotional scars that were left by the tragedy, and how Melina deals with her feelings of depression/anger/isolation the following freshman year.",1128124800,,1327,5.0
2378648,4,B000A7Q2I2,"Speak is a powerful movie. It has great acting by Stewart and Zahn (who I normally aren't fond of) The story is good, but the only flaw is the ending seems to be a little too abrupt. A good film.",1128038400,,195,3.9
2378649,5,B000A7Q2I2,"In my review a year ago of ""Catch That Kid"", I referred to Kristen Stewart as a young Portman/Knightley. Most people thought I was going a bit overboard but with her performance in ""Speak"" I feel even more confident of my assessment. Although ""Speak"" was shot within a few months of ""Catch That Kid"" Stewart looks considerably older, with the Portman/Knightley connection even more obvious. Her understated performance as Melinda Sordino is absolutely riveting. Stewart's performance is critical to this film because she is not just the central character but also the narrator, the entire story is told from her point of view.

Cinematographer Andrij Parekh gets maximum effect from the camera as the film is filled with tight shots of Stewart's face and eyes. Director Jesseca Sharzer gets an incredible non-verbal performance from Stewart which is nicely offset by the voice-over narration. Like the narration in ""The Opposite of Sex"" and ""Girl"" this helps relieve the intensity and introduces some wry humor into the story. I particularly liked Stewart's offhand voice-over on her way to the principal's office: ""I forgot that the suffragettes were hauled off to jail, duh"".

Melinda's flat and distanced narration is often contradicted by the crushing emotional trauma she is experiencing on the screen, this dichotomy is a very effective way to illustrate her inner strength and multi-dimensionality.

Parekh complements his close work with interesting short focal transitions and some good exterior shots. One especially nice one is when Stewart is walking in the distance and the focus slowly changes to highlight a bee and a flower in the foreground.

Like ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", the adult roles are a bit extreme but the student roles are very convincing.

Interestingly, the climatic scene actually occurs about 15 minutes before the ending. Melinda's rejuvenation happens during her impromptu hospital visit, her voiceover reflects this change: ""It happened. There's no avoiding it. No forgetting.""  Strong again she dumps Heather, plays a killer set of tennis, and bicycles to the scene of last summer's party where she confronts what happened to her and decides to tell Rachel. The tree that inspired her painting helps tie everything together.

Virtually everyone should find this film engrossing, but it will especially appeal to those who like to see their heroines get stronger as a story progresses.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

NOTES ON THE ADAPTATION: A personal visualization process occurs when reading a book that often makes its movie adaptation less powerful and less enjoyable. But it also affords the opportunity to focus on understanding why the screenwriter, director, and editor choose to use, alter, or omit each element in the book. Adaptations are all about economy and efficiency as they try to tell the same essential story visually and often symbolically.

In the case of ""Speak"", I think the movie is more powerful than the book as you feel Melinda's trauma more, even if you don't understand it as precisely. The visuals of Melinda's emotional battles are more powerful than any narrative; as are the visuals of her drawings and of the process of her growing stronger as the story progresses.

The adaptation shows Melinda's parents more positively but still portrays them as disinterested. The key scene is Christmas morning. Watch how after receiving the art supplies Melinda is pleasantly stunned that her parents were actually aware that she was drawing, then quickly disappointed when they disconnect and start their own conversation about the stereo system, which brings on the flashback of them not being there when she returned home from the party.

They wonderfully condense the process of Mr. Freeman connecting with Melinda, the key scene is when he and Ivy are discussing her art project with the turkey bones and the palm tree. Melinda is seated as they come into the frame from both sides. The camera is static as they discuss the project until just before Mr. Freeman says the word ""pain"". At that point they cut to a tight reaction shot of Melinda's face as the word registers and her eyes look up at him in surprise. With that short sequence they manage to communicate about 50 pages of narrative and to say all that is needed about the special relationship that Melinda and Mr. Freeman will develop. The viewer is shown not just that he is picking up her pain from the symbolism in her art work, but more importantly that she now realizes there is someone who is tuned in and interested in her welfare. This little sequence is truly inspired and a great illustration of the visual power of film.",1125964800,71,4675,5.041450777202073
2378650,5,B000A7Q2I2,"I read the book that inspired this movie a few years back when I was a freshman in high school, now a junior in college and I loved it then and loved it now when I recently reread it. Even though it's a book targeted at teenagers for it's easy reading I have to say it is definitely at the top of my list forever. I just saw the movie on Lifetime yesterday and loved it. I know the moment I read the book, being a movie lover, the first thought that came to mind was ""God, I hope they make this into a movie"" and I'm glad they finally did. Everything about the movie was great althought I noticed a few details that could've been expressed a little more, especially her feelings and the things she thought to herself when put in a certain situation. Kristen Stewart is definitely great and someone I will look for in any of her upcoming movies. Five stars all the way for this movie. I know I'm definitely going to buy it.",1125964800,3,922,4.156424581005586
2378651,5,B000A7Q2I2,"I've seen plenty of movies regarding this same case but never have I seen it done this way. My cousin told me about this movie and said I had to see it. When she started to tell me about it at first I thought No Not another movie with a young girl who gets raped and the entire movie sucks because the girl is blamed and called a liar for the entire movie because the rapist is a jock or someone highly respected who everyone else trust and the poor child doesn't get any justice until the end of the movie.

I was very wrong this movie was in reverse this girl chose not to tell what happened at all which would explain the title. I didn't cry but I really wanted her to take action in some form. Every minute of this film brings some kind of emotion because Kristen Stewart did such a great job you just wanted to help her say something or defend her. This girl starts with a great life with best friends; good grades, and has a great life at home but then her life turns to hell in just one night. A few minutes after Melinda was raped she called the police and a party with a bunch of teens with so many illegal substances don't really go with the police. People get arrested and some of their records are ruined and this sparks Melinda's exile of the entire school including her friends.

 Everyone who means something to her turns their back on her in different ways but still the problem burns inside of her but not enough for her to speak. Her mother works too much her father doesn't work at all and doesn't know how to talk to her and on her first day in high school all of her friends join other social groups to get away from her. This movie is original with a great cast and Kristen Stewart just keeps getting better. This is a great story but it's a shame kids are going threw this.",1125878400,7,1796,4.155172413793103
2378652,5,B000A7Q2I2,"Like another reviewer, I too started to watch this movie in the wee hours of the night. Unlike the other viewer, I cried non stop throughout the whole movie. This movie has a theme winding through it where the girl is so drawn inward, possibly for emotional self preservation; that I was physically in pain for her. This is an example of how excellent her acting was. The title being ""Speak"", it could have just as well been titled OPEN YOUR EYES!!!! She had loving parents, good friends and capable teachers that saw her do a total 360 degree turn in lifestyle, dress, attitude, grades.....and rather than sit down and open their mouths  asking ""what is going on, how can we help, WE LOVE YOU"".....she became almost invisible right in front of them. The characters throughout this movie were excellent.

The ex best friend who invited her to lunch, to tell her she didn't want to have lunch with her any more.

The jerk teacher who arrogantly was going to MAKE her talk, apparently to pet his own ego rather than to HELP her.

The boy, a classmate who although his character was not thoroughly developed, he was a constant normal prescence in her life. He did not chastise her for changing. He did not pressure her to talk. He did not humiliate or tease her. He did not try to take advantage of her emotional vulnerability, yet he did nothing really extraodinary other than be there.

When this movie was over, I was exhausted from the roller coaster ride of emotions. I did not know the name of the movie, but I did an Amazon search based on the one actress whose name I knew. Elizabeth Perkins. I recognised DB Sweeney as the dad but could not remember his name.  I decided I was going to buy three copies of this film as soon as I could. One for each niece and one to place in  the library of the High School I once attended. This seems to me, to be a perfect way to introduce to teens the seriousness of date rape. This movie shows this, and it does so in a series of flash backs weaved throughout the movie so that you eventually see what happened, but not in a shocking over the top scare tactic way. It could also be used as a tool to help show victims that they do not have to suffer in silence, but they can get help, live through it and eventually be OK. And like all other good movies......without ruining it for you....there are a few ""YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!!!'s""",1124323200,7,2371,4.387243735763098
2378653,5,B000A7Q2I2,"I started watching this movie on TV at 2 AM in the morning, just because there was nothing else to watch. But after about twenty minutes, I was glued to the couch until the end!

At first it appears like a typical coming-of-age movie about a teenager who defies authority in trying to find her identity. Only as the story progressed, I realized that she was not normal teenager, she lived with a horrible secret that no one else knew.

The story shows you how a once popular, outgoing girl is destroyed by the memory she can't forget. She loses her friends, her grades drop, she stops speaking, and no one knows why. It also shows you how the same girl can discover how to overcome her fears with the help of an unusual art teacher and a boy who isn't afraid to speak up.

Because the secret is so integral to the story and part of the reason I like it so much (and you probably know anyways), I'll just say it. She was date raped and didn't tell anyone for a year; in fact, she stopped speaking. The truth about what happened is only revealed later in the story (though it is fairly obvious what happened).

I was blowned away by Kristen Stewart's acting. She WAS Melinda for me. Melinda: the hurt, but not defeated, defiant and quirky girl; a real human I could relate to, not the-girl-who-was-raped. Her painful interactions with her old friends made me cringe along with her, and every time she saw the boy who had raped her or her parents yelled at her, I wished she would TELL someone the truth!

As a teenager myself, I appreciated the accurate portrayal of the teachers and student life. The teachers remind me of my own: there are those who are arrogant idiots who want to shove their opinions down your throat; the nervous teachers, and the occasional live-changing, inspirational teacher. And the stupid cliques, peer pressure, and general shallowness that is hallmark of highschool was dead-on.

The ending almost made me cry. I won't spoil this for you, but I think it was an almost perfect ending. Afterwards I kept thinking about this movie. I wish more people would watch this movie; then maybe we would be more aware of what happens to the people around us.",1122940800,10,2315,4.4714285714285715

2378729,5,B000A7Q2I2,"This is a small movie that Kristen Stewart was in before she became famouse because of the Twilight saga.
Her debut film Panic Room's charactor is closer to the image with the roll which she is in this film.
She is a bit boyish but shy, not fully grown up girl who had a bad memory- sexually raped by the boy at the summer party before going to the highschool. She tries to call the police from the party, but that just leads to the cops showing up and breaking up the party and getting a lot of Kristen's  friends in trouble. She was shy enough to tell the event to her parents not only because she was shy but also because of the gap between her and her parents.
She decides not to talk in school and that makes her alienated her from other students.
She played the roll of a girl who is fragile and even a small touch can shatter her totally.
She was lucky enough to find this rusty room from the school and she makes herself compfortabe there. And also she made friends with the art teacher, and a girl who is now dating with the guy who raped her. She slowly recovers herself and finally gathers herself.
Finally she made a courage to tells the secret story that what happened that night to her mother after the recovery.
The story is not a great one or something imaginative. It's the manner and the way how it flows. The acting and the tone of the film that makes this movie a decent one.
The director does not have a lot of experience making movies but she did a fine job making this one as if she have made hundreds before.
Then again, it has nothing to do with the resume, it's how the director have in mind and how much confident about how she/he will make the movie.
I know that Kristen has a lot of personal issues but in terms of acting, she was truethful. She was never tried to show herself to be great or someone cool. She just acts as if she is herself which makes her acting career keep going.

2378820,4,B000A7Q2I2,"Like its source material, a novel of the same name, this film tackles an extremely difficult subject.  A young girl is raped at a party and is subsequently unable to talk about it or even tell anyone what happened, consequently becoming subdued and nearly mute as the viewer gets an insight into her personality via her often sardonic thoughts.  This film does pretty decently at showing us the difficulties such a trauma can inflict on a teenaged girl, this one played by Kristen Stewart.  This film could have gone the route of the preachy, corny, uninteresting story, but it didn't.  It handled the problem as we would in the real world...for the most part.  I won't fault any of the other characters for not relishing what happened to our leading lady...it is an unfortunate truth that sexual assaults often go unreported and it probably wouldn't be the first to come to anyone's mind.  I guess my only problem with this film is that, given the subject matter, it ended a little too perfectly...barely a hint of ambiguity.  But it's a decent film with a good cast, even if they are mostly unknown to me.  Go ahead and watch it.  It's a great breakout role for Kristen Stewart.  Enjoy.",1403395200,,1188,4.668269230769231

Normally I would not have watched this since I am a grandmother to six, with the oldest being almost 20.  Kristen Stewart was in the movie, so I was curious.  I became very involved in the life of the young girl in the movie.  She was dealing not only with a brutal rape, but lost friendships and not telling her parents of her tradegy.  The parents are at a loss as to why she has become so ""distant, rebellious, a loner etc,"".  The ending was the way it should be.

2378851,4,B000A7Q2I2,"Like the book, Speak the film does a good job staying true enough to the characters and most of the events that I believe many fans of the book will be content with.  Kristen Stewart pulls off a relatively fine performance playing a social pariah in her new high school after a tragic event silences her voice from her pupils, teachers, and parents.  This role fits Stewart well since she has the plain Jane, average girl determiner that she channels into a dark Melinda character, so it works!  The acting for the reminder of the cast isn't over-the-top or too superb neither, as it takes on more suttle approach.  I do suggest reading the book first to build up a good vibe before watching for the film.

I went ahead and watched the movie again (all the way through) to make a comparison, and I found that the book is much better. Perhaps part of it is that the book is written almost entirely from the inner-workings of the protagonist's mind; however, her personality and profound silence are lost in translation in the movie, since by necessity a character in a movie that is interacting socially has to speak in order to move the plot more smoothly. The main thing that bothered me is how the movie changed the dynamics of the rape scene; it made Melinda look like more of a flirt who only wanted to go halfway, rather than the half-dazed/drunk girl who was overtaken by this huge sports jock while she was walking alone and then forcibly pushed down and raped. Finally, the book was much more impressive than the movie, since the movie had to condense characterizations and scenes that were much more convincingly developed by the author.",1343001600,4,1085,4.626943005181347

2378863,2,B000A7Q2I2,"I guess I hadn't realized just how much of a teenager movie this was. The description I read was pretty deceptive, actually.

Melinda (Kristen Stewart) was raped in the summer between her eight and her ninth grade. She didn't tell anyone, but she was not a ""selective mute"" as she is described. Yes, she had some problems with the other kids at school, mostly because when she was raped at the party, she called 9-1-1 and the cops busted the party for underage drinking and possibly other things. But for reasons she never clearly explains, she went home and did not tell the police why she had made the emergency call.

The rest of the story is mainly about how really mean some teenagers can be, but also about how at least one or two can be nice. Her art teacher is cool but does not fit into the suburban uptight community, whereas her neo-Nazi social studies teacher does. In fact, the story is pretty full of stereotypes.

2378868,5,B000A7Q2I2,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal--the acting and direction were very good, and the story was realistic and it held me very strongly.  I appreciated the fact that they didn't allow the main character to digress to victimhood; instead, it's a very gripping tale of a girl who simply takes some time to come to grips with something awful that happened to her.  In a culture in which we all want to ""cure"" people as soon as we can when they go through trauma, it's nice to see a story which shows respect for the need to take some time to deal with feelings of betrayal, helplessness, confusion, frustration, and anger (among many others, I'm sure).  Personally, I didn't like the next-to-last scene in her sanctuary, but it still works whether I like it or not.",1319155200,,759,4.525547445255475
2378869,3,B000A7Q2I2,"I'll start off by saying that I haven't read the book, so I don't know how they compare. It doesn't really matter, I guess, since an adaptation should be able to stand on its own.

""Speak"" is a good movie, not great. The overall acting is good, but I especially liked Michael Angarano, Hallee Hirsh, and Steve Zahn. There are just certain actors who stand out, and for me they were it.

One of the most obvious flaws is the sterotypical characterizations. There is a lack of originality in some of them, and you could find similar characters in other books and movies without much effort. As a story, it runs fairly predictably. Nothing is out of the ordinary, and whether or not you know that Melinda was raped beforehand, it's obvious. That probably wasn't meant to be a mystery, though. I also found the ending to be a bit set-up. I get it, though. The point was for Melinda to have her justice and to have it done in a satisfying way, but it wasn't realistic.

Kristen Stewart is okay in this. I know a lot of people think she was amazing in this role, and while she's certainly not bad, I wouldn't call it great. If you've seen any of her other movies or seen her interviews, you can easily tell that even back when this was made she was using her usual tics and mannerisms. I don't want anyone to think I'm doing an anti-Kristen Stewart rant, because I'm not, I'm just pointing out that she's playing herself to a degree. I thought she was much better when she wasn't talking.

All in all, ""Speak"" is okay, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1313884800,2,1543,4.384615384615385

Kristen Stewart does an amazing job of playing a broken young girl harboring a secret she feels she has to keep from everyone, including her own parents, which only ends up shoving her into a deep depression and ostracizing herself from her peers at school. It's an eye-opening film that shows what type of damage rape can do to a girl and it is definitely a movie that I feel every mother and daughter should watch together. Its uplifting message is something that every person who watches this movie could learn from; female or male. 5 stars!",1290384000,,631,4.642857142857143
2378876,3,B000A7Q2I2,"Being the new kid in town is rough.  For Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart), has it especially difficult because other students go out of their way to ostracize her as retaliation for ruining a party the previous summer (she called 911 and the police raided the party).  What those students don't realize, however, is she was date raped at the party.  The peer harassment - not to mention very poor teachers - is the least of her emotional worries.

Watching an affable, promising teen turn into a reclusive social pariah is incredibly difficult.  Seeing her continually struggle during the school year is enough to make any viewer dumbstruck and heartbroken.  She withdraws into herself, avoiding both friends and family.  The sad irony of this movie is that aside from Panic Room, this is the only movie in which I have ever actually wanted Kristen Stewart to speak.  It's truly maddening considering how perfectly her personality and acting style fit such a role (read: she SHOULD have fewer lines).  Numerous opportunities arise for Melinda to speak up, to tell her parents, to confide in a trusted adult, to scream to the skies.

I didn't think cinematography, casting, lighting, directing, or any other aspect of this film was particularly mind blowing or memorable.  It's simply a heart-wrenching tale with average acting, a Lifetime movie with a bigger budget.  So much more could have been accomplished with better actors, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that the emotion in this movie is powerful.

2378878,5,B000A7Q2I2,Brilliant film dealing with an issue that's not addressed enough in our industry. Kristen Stewart gives a resounding breakout performance. I would highly recommend this film to purchase for the permanent collection.,1281571200,,215,5.75
2378879,5,B000A7Q2I2,"How much do I love Kristen Stewart, let me count the ways: 1.- I love that she portrays her characters true and through. 2.- I adore her transformation for such characters. 3.- I also think ""she is the best actress of her generation"" to quote Rob himself. 4.- I admire her dedication to her craft. 5.- I think her work ethic is something to look up to.
Now, about this movie I wanted to scream at the screen ""please get help"", ""everything will work out"". She was already a pro when she filmed this TV movie and yet you see her as if it was the first time you've seen her act.
And it's only the beginning, her upcoming roles will showcase her incredible acting talents.",1280188800,,668,4.309523809523809

2378882,5,B000A7Q2I2,"Kristen Stewart as Melinda Sordino, 14 starts her freshman year of high school under a cloud.  Ostracized by her peers for calling the police during a summer party she attended, Melinda is forced to fend for herself to a large extent.

Melinda's parents don't really communicate with her.  Melinda's behavior hollers trauma - the extended silence and change in eating patterns as well as her poor grades are all red flags.  One can cheer Melinda's logical refusal to answer rhetorical questions.  It does make one wonder what the point of rhetorical questions are since the one asking them usually doesn't want an answer.  It irked me that Melinda's parents would ask such foolish questions which in turn precluded any chance at discourse.

Melinda has also become quasi-mute.  Only one girl attempts to befriend her.  Heather, a transfer student is the only person who attempts to befriend Melinda.  It turns out Heather has an agenda - she wants to be accepted by a clique (called a ""clan"" in this film) called the Marthas (after Martha Stewart) who are held in high regard by teachers and administrators alike.  In the 2004 film, they are described as ""very Connecticut, very preppy.""  The Marthas are known for doing home ec projects for the community and creating party motifs for school functions.  Heather feels Melinda's artistic skills will give her a leg up with the Martha crowd.

There are notes of humor that offset the grim and serious subjects covered in this book.  The school board didn't want to spend money on changing the school uniform colors when the issue of choosing a new mascot came up.  The high school principal is humorously named Principal Principal.  Melinda's art teacher, played to perfection by Steve Zahn is the aptly named Mr. Freeman.  He encourages his students to free themselves of inhibitions through art.  He assigns each student an object to create in some artistic medium.  Melinda's assignment is a tree.  (Landscaping and trees also crop up in ""Twisted"" and lanscaping plays a significant role in both of these books).  Mr. Freeman is a delightful character and is also a sympathetic ear for his students.  He has a brilliant way of lashing out at injustice - he inserts rude caricatures of school board members who have made budget cuts into the school art program.

A kind classmate named David Petrakis also stands up for Melinda. He even stages a brilliant coup d'&eacute;tat in their government class.  He brilliantly rebuts the dictatorial tone their government teacher takes when he closes down a debate simply because his students are offering differing viewpoints.  David also encourages Melinda to speak up and provides her with the tools to do so.

In time, Melinda discovers her true voice.  The writing style of giving readers a glimpse into Melinda's mind and guiding readers with her thoughts make for very effective story telling.  Readers can feel Melinda's rage at those who have harmed her.  Over time, her character builds in strength and momentum.

I just loved it when Melinda, drawing upon her newly discovered resouces tells Heather that she refuses to let her use her to get in with the Marthas.  After Heather drops her as a friend, she has the temerity to come to Melinda when she needs something.  Melinda wisely turns down Heather's offer to redecorate her room and help her with a school project the Marthas have taken on.  After Heather had rebuffed her once in the book, readers will want to cheer Melinda's refusal to accept crumbs from a fair weather friend.

Readers are not informed as to what trauma caused Melinda's quasi-mutism.  The incidents and reasons for that are unfurled as the story rolls along.  Simon & Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"" underscores this book.

Laurie Halse Anderson is a genius, plain and simple.  This is a very serious and important book that I would highly recommend to families, educators and medical professionals.  This is a book that is screaming for attention for book discussion groups.  This is a book everyone needs as the serious issues it covers are relevant and timely.  This is a book for everyone.

I also highly recommend ""Twisted"" for the same reasons.",1270944000,,4179,4.9354375896700144

2378887,4,B000A7Q2I2,"""Speak"" is the story of an average girl, Melinda (Kristen), who is just about to enter her freshman year of high school when she goes to a party and is raped by a handsome upcoming senior. Although she originally calls the police, she changes her mind and makes the mistake of keeping the incident a secret. Because all of her middle school friends were angry with her for ending the party that they were at by alerting the police, they all drop her, and she enters high school friendless and depressed. And there, our wonderful story unfolds.

I was a little bit hesitant about watching this film. I watched it when it was on TV, on Lifetime Channel, which usually has all of the melodramatic soap opera-ey movies, so I was not sure whether or not it would be any good. But I usually love stories about people in depression, and I love Kristen Stewart, so I decided to give it a try. It managed to avoid most of the clichs that I was expecting to see in a movie like this, so I was pleasantly surprised. Only two little things that annoyed me happened, such as a random person throwing food at Melinda on the first of school, and somebody saying to Melinda, ""You're just jealous of me because I'm more popular!"" However, these were just little occurrences and did not take away from the story.

I've always liked Kristen Stewart as a person, because she always come off to me as being so real. One can tell that she's always shy when being interviewed, and I absolutely loved it when she dropped her award for 'Best Actress' at the MTV movie awards after winning for Twilight, because you can tell that she's different than the other picture-perfect celebrities out there. I thought that she was very well-cast as Bella in 'Twilight,' but she was unable to show off her acting prowess in that movie. However, in this movie, her character was a very conflicted person, and Kristen portrayed her brilliantly. She was also the correct age for her character, because she was about fourteen when this was made, and her character is a high school freshman. (I always hate when twenty year old actors play fourteen and fifteen year-olds.) Kristen is a very pretty actress, and her character was one who no longer cared about anything, her appearance least of all. Kristen was certainly dressed down in this film, which made her character more believable.

I thought that high school life was portrayed accurately for the most part. I felt that Melinda's teachers were portrayed well, from the strict conservative history teacher who has a vendetta against Melinda from the beginning, to her free-spirited art teacher (played by Steve Zahn.) A lot of the movie is just Melinda narrating her thoughts, about high school, and life in general. Her comments about high school are very accurate, for example when she states that they are taught American history each year. yet they never get past one point. My school system has only ever taught up to the World Wars, and most people in my school are completely ignorant about the more modern history.

Overall, this is a wonderful movie going deep into the thoughts of a rightfully depressed high school, that should definitely be watched. (And, don't worry, the ending is not too unhappy.)

Spoiler Alert: My thoughts on the ending. (Only read if you already know the story.) While the ending of the movie was not bad, I felt that it was just a little bit weak. While her rapist was definitely not a sympathetic character, I had actually liked thought of him being slightly remorseful. (For, example, in the scene, when he is leaning very close to her at the cafeteria, and to the shock of her friends, she runs away from him. They make a disparaging remark about her, and he is quick to defend her.) While I was definitely glad that she told we were left with the assumption that he would be punished for his actions, I would have preferred it had the writer not had him come back and try to attack her. It just seemed like a light, easy way to end the sotry, and was not as deep and profound as it could have been.",1264291200,,4056,4.596685082872928

2378890,5,B000A7Q2I2,"No book to film comparison here, as I have not read the book yet.

Kristen Stewart does a fine job here as the brooding, picked-on high school girl Melinda, who tries to get through life without acknowledging the terrible attack on  her that occurred in the previous year.  She finds out that being silent about something traumatic does not make it go away, but it does make everything much worse.  There are many times when you wish you could yell at her and tell her to speak up.  This is an important story for teens and parents to view together or for teachers to show to their classes.  Silence can be a dangerous and destructive thing.",1258243200,,641,4.482758620689655
2378891,5,B000A7Q2I2,"I came upon this movie while viewing the library dvd's on the shelf.  I saw ""Speak"" and thought Why Not? I had seen Kristen Stewart in a few good movies including Twilight and The Messengers, so this might be half decent.  I'm so very glad that I grabbed it.  This movie is a surprisable and unexpected gem.  Kristen Stewart is utterly amazing and her emotions are so open throughout this film if only through her facial expressions, eyes, or even her tone of voice.  She aces her role as Melinda who had an horrific event at the prior years' end and didn't know how to tell anyone about it.  So she kept it hidden inside of her as she began her Freshmen year of high school.  Her parents, her ""ex"" best friends, the other students, could not understand her and many disliked her for calling the police during the prior years' event.  We find out what happened to Melinda as the movie goes along and why she is the way she is all the while enthralling the viewer to constantly wonder why and how can Melinda save herself and move on.  This movie is very powerful and touching from the very first scene to the ending credits.  If you like drama, human emotion, and justice, you will simply love this movie and want to watch it over and over again.  And for those Kristen Stewart fans out there, this movie is probably her best.  Don't miss out on this remarkable gem which includes wonderful performances from its co-stars, especially Steve Zahn, Elizabeth Perkins, and D.B. Sweeney.

Despite being 13 or 14 when she acted in Speak, Kristen carried it off very well with a certain air of maturity and strong emotions. I cried at the end of the film cus' it was a touching and brilliant performance - the plot of the show, the acting, the emotions, life at home, parents, friends, cliques, school humiliations, teachers, finding your true self and the courage to open up yourself after all the hurt that you have gone through and finally, finding the courage to speak out.

2378911,4,B000A7Q2I2,"I'm a young adult librarian, and in nearly 10 years of reading teen literature professionally, Laurie Halse Anderson's ""Speak"" is in a very select handful of young adult novels that I think manage to be both completely contemporary and profoundly impactful at the same time.  Anderson's beautful, sensitive and disturbing book needed an equally sensitive film treatment, and I think they nailed it with this Showtime production that garnered great reviews at the Sundance Film Festival.

Casting the lead, Melinda Sorvino, was crucial to successfully filming a novel that is largely interior.  Melinda is selectively mute after a trauma, and grows progressively more so throughout the story, so the young actress needed to convey Melinda's interior battle largely though her eyes and face.  Kristen Stewart has an essential quality for a compelling actor: her eyes are the mirrors of the the soul of her character.  Even though she tends to rely on a stock range of facial expressions, her eyes have great depth that draws the camera in.  It remains to be seen whether Ms. Stewart, currently enjoying international stardom as Bella Swan in ""Twilight"" and the forthcoming ""New Moon"" will be able to mature from teen roles into a fully-rounded adult actress, but despite her youth, she's got the eyes of an old soul.  ""Speak"" was filmed 5 years ago, when Stewart was only 13; as such her command of the screen was astounding given her relative inexperience. In fact, she seems no more immature, in either looks or acting style than she presents as Bella.  Whether that means she has developed all the farther she is going to go as an actor than she shows as a precocious 13-year-old is hard to say.  I thought her performance as Bella was defined by a marked lack of expression, but this same rather sullen, detached demeanor is perfect for Melinda.

At the start of the story, Melinda is going to school for the first day of ninth grade.  This makes Melinda and Stewart the same exact age, which in itself is unusual in a teen movie, where teens are often portrayed by actors in their 20s.  Due to an incident that occurred over summer vacation, Melinda is being shunned by not only her former BFFs, but half the large school.  Unlike the novel, the film does not keep what actually happened veiled until the end, but employs frequent flashbacks to the incident as Melinda struggles through a very rocky freshman year.  Since the secret is out of the bag minutes into the film, I don't think I'm spoiling anything to reveal that Melinda was sexually assaulted by an upperclassman at a house party and called 911.  Partygoers don't know what happened to her--only that she called the cops and got everyone busted.  So Melinda, being persona non grata at school, and unable to unburden herself of the truth, retreats further and further into herself.  The only solace she finds is in art class, where an unconventional teacher (Steve Zahn) both encourages and allows Mel to express herself through art.  The relationship Melinda has with Mr. Freeman, and with the art room itself is a centerpiece of the book, and it is not exploited fully onscreen, where art just seems to be one of many things going on in Melinda's life, and not her sole lifeline.  She also is provided with some friends, some dialogue and a set of caring parents (Elizabeth Perkins & D.B. Sweeney), rendering her far less of a basket case than the character in the book.  In all other respects, Stewart captures the agonizing self-consciousness of adolescence in a pitch-perfect performance.  As someone who's old enough to be her mom, I can't help wondering WHY Melinda can't bring herself to tell anyone what happened to her for nearly a year; this novel and film, if they do nothing else, present a cautionary tale for young girls in how NOT to behave in the aftermath of a sexual assault.  I highly recommend that teen girls, as well as their parents, read and watch ""Speak"" together, and have a frank discussion about how Melinda could have handled her situation better.  This will no doubt be as painful to a typical teenage girl as dental work without novacaine, but she will be grateful for it later, if a time comes when it matters.",1235001600,,4209,4.791147994467496

It shows the story of a typical teenage girl leading a typical teenage life until one night at party she devastated by being a victim to rape. Speak is a very good movie, it shows how a young female would react if she were to be a victim to rape. This movie also shows the effects of what can happen if you keep things bottled in for to long. The only thing that I did not like was the  leave-you-hangin' ending that it gives you. Overall the movie was great I would recommend this movie to any class. But it also lacks some of the elements that made the book good. In any case this is a very good movie made from an extraordinary book.",1222387200,,688,4.0588235294117645

The does do a decent job of transitioning the book into a movie. There were some slight differences in details, like the book cites New York as the setting and the movie cites the Midwest. There were also some bigger differences that were more noticeable, for example, the book says Melinda is around a size 10 and the movie portrays her very slender- this is just a detail though and doesn't really affect the structure of the plot. The biggest difference that is probably noticed is that the book does a better job at describing the severity of Melinda's emotions and thoughts. The reader gets a better understanding of the pain Melinda was in emotionally.

When starting watching it, I was immediately shocked by who was playing the main character (Kirsten Stewart, who is an exceptional actress). What I was watching was nothing like I had imagined. Myself being a teenager, had imagined a more mature looking girl, because in my experience, those types of girls are the ones that hit it big with the older boys.

Also, there is a critical scene in the book that is not even mentioned in the movie (the pinning of the frog).  This scene is a wonderfully written parallel to what happened to Melinda.  It does not make the movie.

2378932,5,B000A7Q2I2,"The movie Speak is a magnificent adaptation of a powerful and tremendous young adult novel by Laurie Halse Anderson. I loved every part of the movie, from the actors to the camera work. Kristen Stewart pulls off one of the hardest parts of acting with a remarkable flawlessness; she portrays the emotions and pain of her character using very few words. Every actor was amazing and pulled off the sparse dialogue and facial expressions that was integral to the movie. I felt as if I was in a real high school, with Melinda, feeling her fear and pain along with her humor and joy.

  The one scene I had a problem with, not acting wise but with the subject matter, was the rape scene. It was one of the most difficult things I have had to watch; I felt physically ill. It was wonderfully acted and directed. It moved me to repulsion and tears. I felt trapped and panicked along with Melinda. There are no graphic images, yet the scene remains severely intense. I actually think that the movie offers an even better perspective on the rape scene than the book does, it shows realistic images of the trauma of it, which the book couldn't do.

  While there was some humor in the movie I felt that it didn't show up as often as it did in the book. Maybe because in the book there is a running commentary in Melinda's head it provided an easier outlet for humor. The humor that was in the book was like a breath of fresh air, and the viewer gulped it down with relief.

  I felt no desire to critically compare the book to the movie; it was probably the best adaptation of a written work turned movie. The transition was done with a gracefulness that was extraordinary.

  I highly recommend both the book and the movie. They both follow a young girl down a journey of suffering and stay with her until she finds the light, the freedom, the words.",1191110400,,1841,4.414201183431953

There were constant flashbacks throughout the whole movie. The flashbacks helped to show how much the rape affected the main character. All in all, this is a powerful movie. I don't recommend seeing it with a young child, though, because the rape is shown occuring, and there is also a scene of violence later on in the movie.",1185148800,,639,4.378151260504202

The copy that I rented and the copy that I bought here on Amazon.com showed almost the same type of picture interference.  I watched another copy with a student that I assisted in his literature class, and that copy showed no defects.  Maybe a ""bad batch"" of Speak DVDs were made that suffered a similar defect creating the same kind of picture distortions that I saw in those two copies.

2378938,5,B000A7Q2I2,"As another reviewer stated, I cannot stay dry eyed when viewing this movie.  Melinda's story may be harder for some people to take than others, particularly if they have been victimized themselves and feel that maybe they are somehow to blame when the immediate aftermath around them is negative.

There is no sugar coating here:  One day Melinda (Played with incredible depth and sensitivity by Kristen Stewart.) is a fun-loving teen, and the next she can never look at anything the same way again.  I was angry throughout the film because her suppposed friends should have guessed it took more than calling the cops at a party to turn her into a social outcast.  In fact, her behavior could have told a very perceptive stranger what was wrong, but nobody noticed except one male student and Steve Zahn's art teacher character Mr. Freeman.  Everyone else was cruel and/or indifferent, and that's before they found out what happened to her.

This is the story of one year in the life of a bright young girl after a very troubling incident but, unlike other victims, she didn't keep silent about it for years until her entire life was a complete mess.  It is incredibly moving and well-done.  If you are having some of the same problems, please don't wait until you have a mountain of trouble ahead of you.

2378941,5,B000A7Q2I2,"I think every girl should see this movie during junior high school because the lesson is that important.  The body can heal virtually any harm done by a rape, but keeping a rape a secret causes emotional in psychological damage that will never be healed until the girl deals with it by talking about it.  Girls need a social network under any circumstances; it is essential in a time like that shown in this movie.  Parents can show this movie to their young daughters and then discuss how important it is to tell someone and to talk it out if it should ever happen to them.  If a girl has made the decision to talk about rape before any rape occurs, if it happens she will be 'programed' to do that, making it much easier to do.  Also, if a daughter is behaving 'strangely' psychologically, parents might show her this movie in case such a trauma has happened to her to help give their daughter the courage to speak about it.",1150243200,7,926,4.391812865497076
2378942,5,B000A7Q2I2,"""Speak"" tells the story of a girl, Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart), who made it through the end of the difficult middle school years as one of the popular girls.  She does not appear to be conceited or stuck up; she's only just a girl who enjoys the fact that she and her girlfriends are well thought of and the center of the social scene.  That all changes for Melinda at a summer party thrown at a friends house where she gets friendly with a popular high school jock only to be shockingly date raped by him.  In her shock after the rape, Melinda tries to call the police from the party house, but that just leads to the cops showing up and breaking up the party and getting a lot of Melinda's friends in trouble.  Not knowing why Melinda really called the police leads her group of friends, especially her best friend Rachel (Hallee Hirsch) to ostracize her in the way that kids that age lash out at anything that they don't understand and challenges their socially accepted norms.  Melinda is also hindered by the fact that her parents, despite clearly loving her, are too caught up in their own issues to recognize that their daughter just underwent a tremendous trauma.

  When high school begins that fall, Melinda selectively chooses to remain a mute while enduring the hateful behaviors of her former friends (including Rachel, who is now dating the guy that raped Melinda).  Yet, slowly, through finding herself through an art class with and an art teacher (Steve Zahn) that truly inspire her, Melinda manages to recover and find a new sense of self and confidence and even resolution to the events that have plagued her.

  ""Speak"" has all the makings of a typical after school special that is rife with pretentiousness and pat resolutions.  Yet, it manages to transcend that genre and make for a truly moving film.  The performance of Kristen Stewart and, to a lesser extent, Steve Zahn, is truly remarkable.  Zahn is a known quantity in Hollywood and his performance as art teacher, Mr. Freeman, is full of the pathos we've come to expect from him.  Stewart, who was only 13 when she filmed this role, is simply stunning.  She took a role that actress three times her would find daunting and, not only fulfilled it, but so thoroughly mastered it, that she made it her own.

  It's ironic that Stewart played Jodie Foster's daughter in the hit thriller ""Panic Room"", because she evokes memories of a Jodie Foster from 30 years ago.  Stewart has the same physical look and mannerisms and definitely shows the potential to have the same acting talent.  I look forward to seeing more films starring Kristen Stewart.  I think she will turn out to be a real Hollywood gem and, anyone who has seen ""Speak"", will remember the exact moment when Kristen Stewart gave notice that she had arrived.",1140220800,128,2800,4.680981595092025

She plays a loner in high school she had old friends but that began to haet her cause at a party she called the cops on a boy trying to rap a girl.",1135209600,3,433,3.769230769230769
2378944,5,B000A7Q2I2,"A couple of weeks ago I was browsing the IMDB to see what D.B. Sweeney had been up to lately. Looking through his recent spotty filmography, Speak came up. I read the synopsis and it seemed like something I might enjoy, story-wise and cast-wise (big fan of Steve Zahn as well and was fairly impressed with Stewart's role in Panic Room). I decided to give it a shot and was glad I did, as it has given me quite a memorable movie experience.

Melinda Sordino (Stewart) is a high school freshman, who was once a bright, happy student. One night a terrible event occurs that instantly changes that and simultaneously ostracizes her from her peers. School, is now a torment for her as she has no one to relate to or confide in (her parents (Sweeney & Elizabeth Perkins) are caring but unaware of her issue and oblivious to her). She regresses and rarely speaks to anyone, even to the few who try to reach out to her. One person does manage to break through, her new art teacher, Mr. Freeman (Zahn), who gets Melinda to slowly express her emotions through her art projects. She tries to regain the confidence to open back up and ultimately break free of the shell she has created for herself.

This movie is definitely not a feel-good flick, but the screenplay (adapted from the same-titled book) affords some light moments (usually from Melinda's observations through her inner monologue and rare interactions in the classroom). Stewart is truly the revelation here as she perfectly nails the depressed and isolated role of Melinda and can deftly handle the couple of pretty harrowing incidents that occur. She is definitely one to watch for in the future. Zahn, usually cast for comedic parts, pulls off his best performance. The scene towards the end of the movie between Mr. Freeman and Melinda in her ""safe place"", was enough to bring me to tears, even though there were barely any words spoken. Just perfect.",1130889600,37,1908,4.709580838323354

2378946,4,B000A7Q2I2,"This movie is surprising for a couple of reasons. First, it's surprising how sad it really is. The movie starts off following a girl on her first day of high school. She is an attractive girl. She seems to be a genuinely nice person who is intelligent and introspective. All this makes it hard to understand why she is shunned and tormented by the other students. It's difficult to watch as their behavior towards her continues day after day throughout the school year.

This would have been an effective movie if it just dealt with the problem of teenage harassment and bullying, but it really takes it up a notch about halfway through where it reveals that all of the abuse is over a tragic misunderstanding.

While at a high school party, the previous summer, the girl was date raped by an older boy. She called 911 for help but was unable to say anything and hung up the phone. 911 sent cops to the house who then promptly raided the party. No one knew what really happened so the girl was labeled a squealer and blamed for the raid.

Knowing this doesn't just make the rest of the film more difficult to watch, it makes all of the abuse seen previously feel that much worse.

There are many times throughout the move where she should stand up and speak out for herself but doesn't. Whether it's on the phone with 911, or a power mad teacher who gives her a demerit for tardiness on the first day of school when she can't find her class, or with a boy in her class who she likes, or with her loving but clueless parents, or with her ex-best friends who turned their backs on her after the party. The trauma she suffered has left her timid and withdrawn, and unable to find her voice.

This leads me to the second thing that surprised me: the ending. I disagree with previous reviews that say it ended too soon. The ending is short and abrupt, but it's also surprisingly uplifting and perfect in it's simplicity. It ends with the girl finally being able to open up and talk (hence, the title of the movie) about the rape. It might not seem like much but it's a victory she'd been fighting for the entire film.

A really good movie.",1128816000,7,2134,4.389873417721519
