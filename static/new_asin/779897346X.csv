7900060,1,779897346X,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was in Mandarin. My husband and I want to enroll our son in a Chinese immersion program and thought we'd get a jump start by having his watch cartoons in Mandarin rather than in English. First of all, I didn't read a very important note at the bottom:

Region 6 encoding (This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV.

So this will not play in our DVD player. It can only be seen on our desktop. Fine. My fault. More importantly, this is not Dora the Explorer in Mandarin- it's a cheap English version with Mandarin subtitles! So much for wanting our baby to hear the different sounds of the Mandarin language. Also, the quality is so bad, it's almost comical. Like someone is video taping the program in their living room and then slapping some cheap looking subtitles. Great. We spent almost $60 on this piece of crap I could have gotten this for $3 at a flea market. VERY disappointed!!!!",1384732800,,1043,4.455497382198953
7900061,5,779897346X,"I bought this to help me learn Mandarin Chinese.  While Dora occasionally inserts a lot of child-like emotion into her speech that makes her hard to understand, her vocabulary is low, and it's heavily contextualized, helping someone learn.

It's a pretty good approximation of normal Dora as well, and likely a great choice for parents trying to support their kids learning Mandarin alongside English.

I was able to play this on my PC, but I don't know how compatible it is with standard US DVD players.",1353974400,2,504,4.837209302325581
