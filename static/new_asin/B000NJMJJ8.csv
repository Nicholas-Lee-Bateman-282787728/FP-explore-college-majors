2770482,5,B000NJMJJ8,"THE FINAL PATIENT stars Bill Cobbs as Dr. Dan Green, an aging small town physician w/ a severely ill wife. The good doctor, despite his age, appears to possess superhuman strength and vitality. Two young med students set out to learn Dr. Green's secrets. Unfortunately for them, there's a hefty price for such knowledge! Cobbs is excellent in his role, both kindly and mysterious. PATIENT reminded me of some of the better NIGHT GALLERY episodes from the early 70s. Nice and creepy w/ a malevolent twist...",1273104000,2,506,4.895348837209302
2770483,5,B000NJMJJ8,"With all the hollywood sequels and remakes, great little independent horror films like this are easy to overlook.  This is far better than most of the lame horror films being released recently.  It is odd, ambiguous, freaky and a lot of fun.  The highly original storyline is helped along nicely by fine acting from Bill Cobbs, ALex Feldman and Jason Scott Campbell. I also have to say that I didn't see the ending coming!  This is certainly not a gore fest but it does provide a fare share of genuinely creepy moments and I found myself liking it a lot.  Echo Bridge has given the film a first rate bluray transfer with good PQ and an uncompressed 5.1 soundtrack.  There are also a few making of documentaries, deleted scenes and a director and producer commentary.  This is a great release and an excellent movie worth checking out.",1264204800,20,834,4.63265306122449
2770484,3,B000NJMJJ8,"A great concept for a ""B"" movie and very well acted, even the antagonist is pretty good.  Good Plot and twist to the story with some unexpected surprises.  Good for a midnight movie.",1240272000,7,182,4.484848484848484
2770485,1,B000NJMJJ8,"this is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, it goes really slow, has no point, and jumps around, at the end all I could think was ""Wow that was a waste of time and money""",1196553600,8,189,3.75
2770486,4,B000NJMJJ8,"This is one of those little gems that you love to unearth. It's a tale made for those of us not suffering from Attention Deficeit Disorder. First you start with a premise that seems unusual to say the least, a retired black doctor in a small all white town. Then the good writing, acting and direction make you believe it. You get caught up in the story and hardly notice the hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand up as you put the pieces together.",1183161600,19,456,4.193181818181818

8178819,5,B000NJMJJ8,"Usually I rip these low budget spooky flix apart.  They also usually deserve it.  This was a very inexpensive Blu ray and I love to poke in one of these haunting stories late on a rainy night when I can't sleep usually because my pain meds haven't kicked in yet.  It can be a wonderful diversion if the movie turns out to be a good one.  Often times, I find myself disappointed in the writers efforts or the poor decisions of the directors.

Tonight, on a rainy Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprised for a change.  I plan to keep this one and take it over to mom's and let her enjoy it.  The story moved along like a big budget production.  It followed a logical path and looked like anything but a frightening tale for most of the movie.  Yet the story was interesting as old Doc saved a young boy from a tragic accident but appeared to be unusually strong for his age and condition while saving this kid.  The story develops from there as the people of this small town are naturally curious about these occurrences.  The acting was strong, especially by Bill Cobbs who I have seen in other movies.  He's a very good actor.

This movie is not anything like ALIEN except that the novelty of the story reminds me of that fine movie.  It's an unusual tale that doesn't involve ghosts or real monsters. But the delivery is definitely creepy.  Great effort!  I really enjoyed it.  Some of these movies I watch and then give them away for others to enjoy.  But, like I said, I will be keeping this one in my CREEPY LIBRARY!  Spend the five bucks for the Blu ray and enjoy it. I believe you will.",1374278400,,1595,4.327702702702703

8178821,5,B000NJMJJ8,"When retired physician Daniel Green (Bill Cobbs, Night at the Museum) lifts a 5-ton farm tractor off a boy trapped beneath, the enigma of his supernatural strength piques the curiosity of two med students passing through town. Visiting the old doctor at his isolated farmhouse, they soon learn his bizarre secret: he has uncovered the key to eternal youth. But sometimes the lust for immortality has deadly consequences. The night takes a twisted turn as the young men discover Dr. Green's ""miracle"" has come with a horrifying price . . . and a fate far worse than growing old.",1348617600,,577,4.838383838383838
8178822,3,B000NJMJJ8,"This film was alright for an indie flick; tolerable acting and a decent story... well for about 3/4 of it, that's when the concerns arise: The 400lb sheriff gets upset when the boys visit the doctor even though no crime was committed. Some crazy butterscotch lady either sleeps, hollers, or lays on the floor with her head in a duct throughout the whole movie. An exotic Buddhist elixir that dumbs itself down to common US rattlesnakes and my personal favorite, ""Hey doc, you're bleeding real bad from your nose and mouth... are you OK?'. Overall I liked it, I think they should have left out Aunt Jemima and the snakes and maybe added a Twilight Zone type ending (old man finds elixir for amazing feats). It's still good though, I did not release my bowels once in shame during this film so it is worth a rental.",1348185600,,813,4.537414965986395
8178823,2,B000NJMJJ8,"I get really disappointed when a horror movie has a great actor, and then leads the whole film down the path of destruction. I mean, at the end of this movie, we all just looked at each other very confused. There was plenty of empty space for filler in this film for them to EXPLAAAAIIIIINNNN stuff. Did they utilize this filler time? Nope.

Nothing was explained, and even though that type of cliffhanger CAN work, I've got to tell ya it doesn't work here.

2 stars for Bill Cobb...he's awesome.

Minus everything else.",1343952000,,520,4.56989247311828
8178824,1,B000NJMJJ8,I love these kind of movies. Saw it years ago on TV and forgot the name of the movie. So then I bought the DVD by mistake. It is just as boring as it was years ago! Save your money. What a waste of time and money for this one.,1309651200,,226,3.54
8178825,3,B000NJMJJ8,"OK movie. Wasn't great, wasn't bad. For the price I paid for it at the time...I do not regret owning this movie.",1300665600,,112,4.136363636363637
8178826,3,B000NJMJJ8,"A retired, somewhat disabled doctor has some kind of ""elixer"" that makes him super-man strong and early on lifts a tractor off a young boy. The young boy's friends tell the sheriff and their account of happenings are discounted.  A former neighbor returning home from college and his friend hear about the story and figure if it's true, they could get the secret and make big bucks.  They go over doc's house for dinner and the doctor tells them about books he came across years ago with this formula in it.  The doctor has a few beers (supposedly he should not drink alcohol with this ""elixer""), passes out and they start wandering about the house to find the doctor's notes.  The doctor's wife whose face is never shown til the end who is ill with some undisclosed ailment and who is apparently off her rocker, comes downstairs in the dark (a storm has knocked out the electricity), takes one of the snakes the doctor uses for his ""elixer"", puts it one of the young men (at which point he is bitten) and it seems he's dead.  She stabs the other kid in the neck.  Then the kid with the snake bite appears, grabs his friend and they escape from the house which at this time has somehow caught on fire (I don't remember how). These are the events which lead up to the scene at the beginning when the kid with the neck wound is in the hospital saying the doc's wife (who is dead) is appearing to him.  The story is interesting, but not scary at all.  This is one I would have rented and not bought.",1276473600,5,1496,4.356115107913669
