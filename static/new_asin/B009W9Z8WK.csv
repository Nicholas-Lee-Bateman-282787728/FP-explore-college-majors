8681945,5,B009W9Z8WK,"Moon Yoga Flow is one of the two best yoga DVD's I've ever watched. The other best yoga video being Gentle Flow Yoga with Julia Tanner Ivanovna. These two DVD's offer comprehensive yoga tutorials for yoga students, teachers & practitioners of all levels -- beginner through advanced. A warm, professional quality presentation offered by a master of multiple yoga disciplines. Includes a helpful bonus tutorial of The Five Tibetan Rites.",1448236800,,436,5.242857142857143
8681946,5,B009W9Z8WK,"I decided to buy the Moon Yoga Flow DVD because I wanted to have a complete set of all the DVDs that Julia Ivanovna Tanner has released.

This DVD has a sweet background in addition to an enormous variety of warm-up movements and stretches. There are 5 Yoga Workout options with a delightful Guided Imagery. And the bonus material of Ancient Rejuvenation Exercises will get you toned and energized.

I really don't know how Julia does it, but she is able to put together a different routine for each DVD. This Moon Yoga Flow DVD is a well rounded session, you tone the whole body, cultivate flexibility, and improve balance. All in all, excellent value for money, as I have found with all her DVDs.",1363392000,,698,4.576
