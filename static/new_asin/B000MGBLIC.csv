2733281,1,B000MGBLIC,"Frankly I'm quite dissapointed in this film. It's in black and white, which actually is no problem for me since I enjoy classic war films. The dissappointmnet is that the whole movie seems to be shot in a studio!!! and a very small studio! Really dissapointed. Also nothing really special about the story.",1181779200,4,305,4.773584905660377
2733282,4,B000MGBLIC,"A solid Sam Fuller directed movie with outstanding performances by Gene Evans and Richard Basehart. Classic Fuller with more dialogue than 'action'. Similar to his other Korean War movie ""Steel Helmet"" including the use of WWII Infantry packs in Korea which had been replaced by then. Overall, a good movie for a Saturday afternoon. Fuller was a veteran WWII Infantryman who showed us the grimness of the front-line soldier's world. It would make a great DVD set with ""Steel Helmet"". Throw in ""Big Red One"" and you would have the key Sam Fuller war movies.",1181779200,22,556,4.863157894736842
2733283,5,B000MGBLIC,This is a taut war movie from Samuel Fuller.  A platoon is cut off from the rest of the outfit and has to try to work itself back.  Richard Basehart plays the corporal who ends up in charge as men get killed off one by one.  Look for James Dean as one of the soldiers.,1173830400,23,268,3.8363636363636364

When the Chinese invade the Division must pull back across the river and set up new defence positions. A stay behind platoon is left on the opposite bank of the river to hold a critical pass. One by one the platoon's leaders are killed and it is up to Basehart to save the day. Excellent Korean War drama/action movie. On par with ""Pork Chop Hill"" and ""One Minute To Zero"".

Somehow even in the twenty-first century Richard Basehart seems a little too upper classed to be a dogface. This was also good because they had a Greek enlisted man in the platoon whose girlfriend ran a pool hall in Pittsburgh.

I am not sure if the original movie was a full screen or a widescreen but the ad was not correct.  The widescreen influenced me from ordering it.  My DVD copy of Fixed Bayonets had subtitles but not the blu ray transfer from KINO LORBER.  For some people having difficulty hearing, the subtitles can make a difference.  I just made a comment on another movie called ENEMY BELOW.  The blu ray transfer was also from Kino Lorber which was very substandard.  Kino Lorber also removed the subtitles.

2733329,5,B000MGBLIC,"FIXED BAYONETS! is one of Sam Fuller's best war films. Set in the Korean War this is a gritty film with very little sentimentality. It is very memorable if you have ever seen it before. FIXED BAYONETS! was written and directed by Samuel Fuller and is very typical of his style focusing on specific events in the story that reflect on the psychological impact and giving way to an emotional reaction to them. Thus, FIXED BAYONETS! is rather thought provoking and does not lend itself to a sweeping narrative flow as was the case with Sam Fuller's later classic WWII films MERRILL'S MARAUDERS (1962) and THE BIG RED ONE (1980). FIXED BAYONETS! is set in the harsh winter and the ""Chinese Intervention"" into the Korean War where death and devastation were daily and hourly seeds of depression on the psyche. It is an interesting film and often difficult to absorb as Fuller intended.",1472947200,3,880,4.758169934640523

2733409,4,B000MGBLIC,"Director Samuel Fuller's ""Fixed Bayonets"" is my all-time favorite Korean War film, and in my opinion ranks as one of the war movie genre's best. Fixed Bayonets is a rather callous war movie that doesn't follow the typical patriotic fever of anti-communist propaganda films of the time. The movie seems more centered on the actual emotions and trials of the everyday grunt in Korea, as well as the time-tested fear if taking another human beings life. The movie sometimes lacks the action of a typically captivating war film, but Fuller uses the storytelling to make up for the lack of explosions and expenditure of ammunition.

The premise of ""Fixed Bayonets"" is that a small platoon of forty-eight men is supposed to keep the onrushing communist throngs from finding out that an entire division is trying to move south to safety. 'Forty-eight men to give 15,000 men a break"" is what the general explains is needed in the beginning of the film, and he handpicks the toughest fighting men to stay behind and blunt the ""commies."" The movie didn't have a monster budget, so the scenes and much of the acting is over-the-top, but for some reason it just seems to add to the enjoyment of the movie for me. Seeing the hardships and trials of the platoon throughout the movie, as well as the personal efforts of corporal Dano to keep Gibbs, Lonagin and ""Rock"" alive (due to his fear of leading) make the film more enjoyable than most Korean War movies in my mind.

Make sure if you enjoy military films, or you really enjoy the Korean War itself, to check out the film ""Fixed Bayonets."" Also, as an added bonus, Fuller gives us one of budding star James Dean's first onscreen roles to soak up as well (Dean appears late in the film as a private standing guard at the river crossing).",1405382400,6,1776,4.6528662420382165

2733433,5,B000MGBLIC,"This is a Korean war movie, realistic in all aspects. The division has to retreat before being surrounded, so they are left with few options as to the withdrawal. A decision to leave a rear guard is their only option, with as few men left behind as possible. So about 30 men are chosen for the job. The movie revolves around 1 man who is an officer candidate school washout who is afraid to literally pull the trigger. He also fears leadership responsibilities, while he is only a corporal, he is 4th inline to be in command of this oversize platoon. This movie was produced by Samuel Fuller a combat veteran which leads to its authenticity.",1391817600,2,641,4.5344827586206895
2733434,5,B000MGBLIC,"I was quite impressed by this little known war 1951 black and white movie. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This was the fourth film turned by Samuel Fuller but only his second war film, after the famous ground breaking ""Steel Helmet"" he made earlier the same year.  Both films action is situated during the Korean War  in both we can also see Gene Evans, who after playing the main character in ""Steel Helmet"" comes back here in a supporting (albeit important) role of Sergeant Rock.

The action of the film is situated during the hardest moments for allied forces engaged in Korea, immediately after the Chinese Army intervened into war. A surprise massive Chinese offensive broke through allied lines and forced Mac Arthur in ordering a general retreat to fall back positions further south on the peninsula.

One of the retreating divisions needs some extra time to withdraw orderly behind the river through the only bridge left, so the general in charge selects a platoon to fight a delaying action, at a narrow passage through the hills. They must hold the position until night and then they can withdraw and make a run for it, to reach the river  if the enemy doesn't exterminate or surround them before that

Amongst the 48 soldiers from this platoon is also Corporal Denno (Richard Basehart), an experienced soldier who certainly can take an order, but simply can't give one But the butcher bill keeps mounting, ranks keep thinning and before the day is over he may be forced to give some orders after all  and very difficult ones with that

The strength of this film resides in two things. The first is a very realistic portraying of war as seen by the simple riflemen of a small infantry unit. The fight against Chinese soldiers is a very tough one, as the enemy is not stupid at all. The fight takes also place in the wilderness, in the middle of a very harsh winter and therefore the land and weather themselves can maim and kill, before even the first bullets start to fly. In fact simply watching the first ten minutes can already make you feel cold

The soldiers in the platoon offer a really good gallery of characters, very various in their perception, of world and reality in general and of this war in particular. In some occasions we can hear their thoughts, especially when expressing their most secret and passionate longings  and, no, sorry ladies, but in fact women play a much smaller part in those deep desires than one could expect)))

The sense of realism in this film was certainly helped by the presence on the set of an adviser, a very decorated veteran of World War II, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Raymond Harvey, who also took part in Korea War and won the Medal of Honor for his exploits in March 1951. Harvey and Fuller (himself a veteran of World War II) became good friends during their work on this film.
Fuller wanted to make this film as a tribute to the simple rifleman of infantry and he made it clearly obvious in the opening statement just after the initial credits: ""This is the story of American troops in Korea early in 1951. It is dedicated to the Queen of Battles - the United States Infantry.""

The second strength of this film is in the psychological tricks with which the director regularly increases the tension. It begins already with the title  in modern warfare, when in a battle soldiers defending a position hear the order ""Fix bayonets!"" that usually means that s*** really hit the fan and the situation REALLY stinks The enemy troopers approach slowly and carefully but on another hand there is a lot of them and they have many surprises up their sleeves. And especially we can observe  the principal character watching with terror as his greatest fear is slowly but surely closing on him and he simply cannot do jack about it!

Richard Basehart, Gene Evans and Michael O'Shea were all solid, good actors and in 1951 they were all in their prime and at the top of their game  and it shows in this film. If anything Samuel Fuller certainly knew how to pick his actors

Bottom line, this is an excellent war movie, which I recommend warmly (even if it a really cold treat). To buy, watch and keep. Enjoy!",1390780800,,4196,4.654939106901218
2733435,2,B000MGBLIC,"Good plot to start,but then comes on slow at times with a bit too much of  those unrealistic battle predictuments (like for instance, the enemy seems at times to forget what going on and the americans seem preoccupied with other personal events. But all and all a good late night movie.",1389830400,,286,4.607843137254902
2733436,5,B000MGBLIC,"In the early Winter campaigns of the Korean War, American troops were ill prepared, ill equipped and surprised by first, the North Korean invasion and, when the invasion faltered and the North was forced into retreat, the second invasion led by tens to hundreds of thousands of Chinese Army troops.  The intervention of China forced the American retreat from the North.

""Fixed Bayonets"" is about a U.S. Army unit having to fall back to the South.  One smaller unit is left behind as the rear guard, to cover the retreat and give the impression that the larger unit was still in place.  The movie is about the men in this rear guard.  The heroes, the cowards, those unsure of themselves and those over confident.  It's well acted, with many familiar faces.  The violence is subdued by modern standards, but with this film the men's struggles with themselves and each other are more important than those with the enemy around them.

If nothing else, ""Fixed Bayonets"" will give you a better idea of the Forgotten War.",1389225600,2,1015,4.76

2733438,1,B000MGBLIC,"The acting is OK. Both movies tell a story about war. If you want to see a war movie with little or no action these two movies are the ones to see.  They only have at the most about 5 minutes of action in them. If you want to see a war movie with a lot of action these are not the movies to see. Guns at Batasi is about what happened with some British soldiers in Africa. There is no combat action in the movie.  Fixed Bayonets! is about a soldier that learns that a soldier at times has to do what he does not want to do. The combat in Fixed Bayonets, if you want to call it that lasts about 3 to 5 minutes for the whole movie. I prefer a lot more and I mean a lot more combat action in a war movie.

2733467,5,B000MGBLIC,"If you can suspend your disbelief, and you can ignore the painted background of snowy mountains and the fake cavern in which most of the movie develops, you'll find that Fixed Bayonets! is a very good movie.
Based on some critics I read previously, I was expecting a typical American war movie where the Americans are depicted as flawless heroes while the enemy is shown as stupid, malevolent sub-humans. Not so. This is a plain story where soldiers are, well, just soldiers. At least as far as I can perceive, there is no political agenda or in your face heroism discourses. Though not much background is provided for each of the soldiers, I felt empathy for each of them. Stereotypes? Maybe, but depicted in a very natural, convincing way. Particularly likeable are the two main protagonists: Gene Evans as the wise sergeant-mentor Rock and Richard Basehart (who even looks quite handsome!) as the conflicted corporal Denno. Anyone who has been in an unexpected position of leadership where you have to make important decision concerning other people will be moved by his conflict. There are several scenes full of a dramatic tension that are hard to match: watch for the mine rescue field; just awesome. In a sentence, totally recommended. I'll get also ""Steel Helmets"" to continue my exploration of Sam Fueller's films.",1291248000,7,1323,4.963963963963964
2733468,5,B000MGBLIC,It tooka long time to find. But well worth the effort. A solid Korean war movie. Who would have thought they would get Sgt. Rock on screen.,1258588800,2,139,4.185185185185185
2733469,2,B000MGBLIC,"I'm probably going to get ripped for writing a negative review since everyone else seems to be a diehard fan of old war movies, but I have to provide a dissenting view. I found the premise of the movie to be absurd, and the battlefield tactics were so ridiculous that I was totally distracted from the story.

The premise is that a 15,000-man division in the Korean War has to make a strategic retreat, and they leave 48 men at a critical pass to cover their retreat. Not only is the number ridiculously small, but they are left with no air support, no artillery support, and not even radio contact with the main force. Hello? this is Korea, not the Civil War. As absurd as the American strategic situation is, the Communists are even more irrational. Their movements are dictated solely for the convenience of the plot. If this were indeed the route for the advancing army, they would quickly overrun the pass with a major attack. Instead they send random skirmishers in a totally disjointed operation, attacking whenever the plot calls for an American casualty or a threat. At the ridiculous climax, one tank shows up after about two days of skirmishing, and it's covered by a grand total of one infantryman.

Even if the premise were scaled back to something reasonable for a platoon, like guarding a supply dump, the Communists' tactics don't make any sense. They appear to mass forces but then send out only a handful of men at a time to attack. Early on they drive the Americans into a cave with light artillery fire, where they are trapped like rats in a barrel, but the Communists call off the attack after shooting one bullet into the cave.

Then the crowning absurdity is that after worrying about frostbite all through the movie, they wade across a river with water up to their chests with no effect, as if they were Union troops crossing a stream in Virginia in August.

The main reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one was that the main character is, surprisingly enough, not a cardboard hero but a real human struggling with cowardice and lack of confidence. This ""Red Badge Of Courage"" theme is fairly compelling in this mess of a movie. I also give points for a 360-degree pan. I didn't know this had ever been done before the 1970's. Some of the characters are written as walking cliches, but at some points the interactions among the men are well-written and well-acted. These mild positives, however, are totally outweighed by the mountain of absurdities this movie serves up.

2733470,4,B000MGBLIC,"One of my favorite directors, Sam Fuller, directs his follow-up to his Korean War classic, ""The Steel Helmet(1950)"" with this white knuckler called ""Fixed Bayonets!(1952)"".

""Fixed Bayonets!"" follows the story of a platoon of men left behind to hold back a Commie counterattack during the Korean War. All the men are a colorful, memorable lot and the film focuses strongly on the Corporal as portrayed by Richard Basehart. While a courageuous man, he has difficulty in firing his weapon. He also is afriad of being in charge and his suspense mounts as one by one the chain of command are knocked off.

This is a very succesful War movie but not quite as fast paced as Fuller's previous classic. Instead Fuller builds suspense and clausterphobia among the ranks as the ebemy closes in on the small number of men. Action is there and is typically quick and unexpected, with a particularly exciting final few minutes.

Fuller injects his usual amount of humor into the picture along with minute details on the plight of the soldier. One of the most memorable moments is that bizarre sequence where all the men keep there feet warm in a cave by massaging them together in a small puddle of water. Or passing the time by creating a replica of Bowling with a snowball and spent shells.

The cast is excellent led by Basehart who brings a toughness and realism that is largely missing from other War movies. Most films in this genre would portray him as a one dimensional coward, but Fuller chooses to depict him in a more well rounded light. Case in point: Look at the Upham character from ""Saving Private Ryan"" for proof of Hollywood's ""easy way out"" writing style to gain a simplistic audience response. Luckily, this film does not go that low.

Gene Evans character is not to far removed from his role in ""The Steel Helmet"" and he easily steals the film as the platoon Sargeant. He was an underutilized actor and was always at home as a ""dogface"" in these War films.

Skip Homier deserves a nod as his know-it-all Private who actually comes across as quite human and likeable. He was even more memorable in the same year's ""Halls of Montezuma"" as the Lugar twirling hothead in Richard Widmark's platoon in the Pacific. He his incredibly effective here and not written as type.

The rest of the cast are mainly familar Fuller stock actors and character performers. A notable exception, towards the end, is James Dean in one of his first film roles.

War buffs would be hard pressed to even considering passing this most excellent squad movie up of one of the most forgotten conflicts in American history. Very reccomended.

The DVD features the original(campy) Theatrical Trailer and some photos, but little else.",1245628800,3,2709,4.771367521367521

2733482,3,B000MGBLIC,"I recently read ""The Last Stand of Fox Company"" about a significant battle in the Korean War.  I was very impressed with the book and the difficult elements that the soldiers had to put up with.  When I saw that ""Fixed Bayonets"" was on TV recently, I made a point to watch it.  The circumstances of the film were very similar to those of the book and I appreciated the way I was able to compare my mental images with the visual ones in ""Fixed Bayonets"".  In the process of supplementing a good book, I rediscovered a good movie.  The focus of the film was the challenge of one man to overcome his weaknesses in an unforgiving environment.  This isn't a great film but it is certainly worth watching.  For those that don't know much about the Korean War, this is a good place to start learning.",1231632000,2,793,4.35374149659864

2733484,4,B000MGBLIC,"After seeing Sam Fuller's ""Steel Helmet"" on one of the classic channels (AMC or TCM), I bought this DVD expecting a movie of similar originality and grittiness. While ""Steel Helmet"" confronts the issue of racism with stark realism and grittiness, Fixed Bayonets takes a somewhat softer approach on the issue of cowardice versus leadership.

This movie describes the actions of a platoon left behind as rear-guard, to allow a badly mauled division to withdraw safely to regroup in the face of imminent Communist-Chinese attack. Richard Basehart gives a believable performance of a Corporal who shies from the thought of having to take command because he is afraid of making decisions that affect other mens' lives. Gene Evans, with an equally good performance, plays the Sergeant who ultimately convinces the Corporal that the yellow streak is not permanent. Ultimately, the Corporal's cowardice dissolves away when he confronts the responsability that is thrust upon him. Unfortunately, this point is made rather laborousily and the movie seems to lumber along part of the way.

If you are a classic war movie buff, I'd say ""Fixed Bayonets"" would make your B list (while ""Steel Helmet"" should definitely be in your A list). Another Korean war movie that should be in your collection is Antony Mann's ""Men in War"".",1216771200,2,1313,5.130841121495327
2733485,3,B000MGBLIC,"An okay movie that felt more like the original made for TV dramas of the late 1950s than a full blown movie.  Appears to have been shot mostly on a sound stage, and the feel is of early video tape rather than film.

The story involves an Infantry platoon in Korea left behind to secure the withdrawal of the rest of their regiment.  They are to hold a position and create a diversion while the regiment withdraws, then to withdraw themselves.  The pivotal character is a corporal who does not wish to have command responsibility, but will have it thrust on him.  (I think this was a theme borrowed from Henry Fonda's role in ""The Imortal Sergeant"").  As he agonizes over the emerging reality that he is going to be put in charge by the slow elimination of those above him, Richard Basehart's character conducts entirely too much internal monologue, which we get to share in.

The small unit Infantry tactics, weaponary, and interactions all feel quite authentic, and this is not a bad little movie, just not one I'd put on my ""A"" list.",1213574400,4,1035,4.562162162162162

2733487,4,B000MGBLIC,"***1/2 1951. Based on a novel by John Brophy, FIXED BAYONETS! was written and directed by Samuel Fuller.

This time, it's the story of a platoon ordered to stop the red army while the rest of the regiment is trying to come back to its base. Replace the STEEL HELMET temple by a cave hidden in the middle of a hill covered by snow and you have FIXED BAYONETS!. Samuel Fuller was more interested in the study of the characters than in the originality of the plot. Anyway, after a film like THE STEEL HELMET, any movie about Korea will seem inferior.

2733488,5,B000MGBLIC,"This movie had haunted me ever since I first saw it on Los Angeles TV when I was twelve years old.  Being the son of a career soldier it was always expected that some day I would serve in the Army.  I always wondered whether I would measure up and be able to lead men in combat.

In 1991 I found myself leading a team of American soldiers advising an  army in a very deadly war against a communist insurgency.  Leadership in combat is the ultimate challenge and when my tour ended, I felt no different then how Richard Basehart's character did at the end of this movie.

Though a bit dated, this movie is my all time favorite and definitely a keeper.",1207612800,9,650,4.2439024390243905
2733489,5,B000MGBLIC,"Some of the best work that came out of the Hollywood studio system of the 1950s is tragically not available on DVD, but the release of Sam Fuller's ""Fixed Bayonets"" is a step in the right direction. This low-budget, Korean War story covers all of the great themes of the time: personal sacrifice for the greater good, every soldier's struggle with fear, and the capacity for heroism in the most unlikely places. Now, how about a DVD of ""The Steel Helmet,"" Fuller's other great Korean War film?",1198281600,,493,4.67816091954023
2733490,4,B000MGBLIC,"""Fixed Bayonets"" (1951) is a very good war movie, directed by a specialist as Samuel Fuller, who also directed ""The Steel Helmet"" (1951) and the exceptionally good ""The Big Red One"" (1980).
As a WWII veteran Fuller knows what war is and what really happens in front line small units.
The present film IMHO, represents a new approach to war movies, stark reality is shown, not as realistic as in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) or ""Band of Brothers"" (2001), but definitely more lifelike than ""Guadalcanal Diary"" or ""Gung Ho"" both from 1943.

The story is about a Company left to fight an almost suicidal rearguard action during Korea War.  Being the main character a Corporal reluctant to assume leadership notwithstanding his personal courage and sense of duty.
Playacting is really good with Richard Basehart as Cpl. Denno and Gene Evans as Sgt. Rock (performing Sergeants is a trademark for him) as the acting high points.
If you are a movie fan try to discover Jimmy Dean in his first film appearance as an uncredited GI.

B&W photography enhances the film by accentuating the desolate winter landscape and martial music follows an old tradition for war movies.

It is a very commendable movie for all those interested in war films.
