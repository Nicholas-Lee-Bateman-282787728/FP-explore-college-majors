634261,4,6303288138,"This Survivor Series 1994 is pretty awesome. My favorite match was the casket match between Yokozuna and the Undertaker with Chuck Norris as the special enforcer. It was really amazing to see Yokozuna thrown in the casket.

Main Match: Undertaker vs Yokozuna

Commentary: The best match in this Survivor Series.

World Championship Match: Bret Hart vs Bob Backlund

Commentary: I can't believe that old crow Backlund actually managed to beat Bret Hart in a submission match. Bret Hart should have won this match.

Match 1: Doink and Midget Clowns vs Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and his Midget Royalty.

Commentary: Match sucked and was utterly boring. A complete waste of time.

Match 2: (Razor Ramon, British Bulldog, 123 Kid and Head Shrinkers) vs. (Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, Jin Neidhart, Shawn Michaels, and Diesel)

Commentary: Amazing match. Razor Ramon and Diesel clean house for their respective teams.

Match 3: (Lex Luger, Smoking Gunns, Mabel and Adam Bomb) vs. (Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Prichard)

Commentary: A decent match.",1123718400,,1072,5.144508670520231
634262,2,6303288138,"Not one of the WWF's better pay-per-views but at the time, it was entertaining. Bob Backlund won the WWF Title from Bret, Undertaker battled Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as ""special guest enforcer"", and Diesel finally had enough of Shawn Michaels as the two split. There was also the forgettable midget match featuring Doink & Jerry Lawler as team captains. If you saw it when it originally came out, you may want to check it out for nostalgia purposes but anyone else may just wanna avoid.",1069718400,2,506,4.696629213483146

The Teamsters: Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, & Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart [5 on 5 Survivor Series Elimination Match] - This was a good opener that progressed at a very good pace but at the same time it was here to help put over the big story between Diesel and Shawn Michaels. Diesel would dominate the whole match and eliminate everybody with his Jacknife powerbomb until Shawn (who never recieved a tag in the match until now) came in and mistakenly super kicked Diesel that caused Diesel to engaged into an outraged fury to chase Shawn all the way up the aisle way. This would lead to Shawn's entire team to be counted out which led to Razor Ramon being victorious of the match while being the sole survivor. But the story here was to cause more animosity between Shawn and Diesel which ultimatley led to their big WWE Title match at WrestleMania 11. 4/5

The Royal Family: Jerry ""The King"" Lawler with Cheesy, Sleazy, & Queasy Vs. Clowns R Us: Doink the Clown with Dink, Pink, & Wink [4 on 4 Survivor Series Elimination Match] - This was comedic entertainment at its best. Doink and Lawler were actual wrestlers who were the captains of their teams where their teamamtes were midgets that were dressed up just like their respective captains. As the match was set up, the rules were wrestler vs. wrestler and midget vs. midget that saw for the most part Lawler being outsmarted in every way possible until Doink's elimination. In the end, the Royal Family was victorious but Lawler would recieved the last laugh at his expense once his teamates turned on him and then gets a pie in the face courtesy of Doink. 3.25/5

WWE Champion Bret ""Hitman"" Hart Vs. Bob Backlund [Submission Match] - The rules for this match was quite different then the rules of today's standard submission match where the cornerman of each participant of the match had to throw in a towel to end the match. This match was tons better then their future WrestleMania 11 ""I Quit"" match where each man went for their submission finishers (Sharpshooter/Crossface Chicken Wing) at numerous times with both men working on various body parts for a submission such as headlocks, arm bars, abdominal stretch, and a figure 4 leg lock among other submission maneuvers. The match was built up very dramatically that saw Backlund having his crossface chicklen wing locked on Bret for a very long time after Owen Hart knocked out Davey Boy Smith which caused Owen to get very emotional that led to him crying and pleading to his parents to stop the match for his family's sake. In the end, Helen Hart threw in the towel that gave Backlund the opportunity to enter his second WWE title run where ironically, only to lose it a few days later in the same place he lost it the first time. 4.5/5

Million Dollar Team: King Kong Bundy, Bam Bam Bigelow, Tatanka, & Heavily Bodies Vs. Guts & Glory: Lex Luger, Mabel, Adam Bomb, & Smokin' Guns [5 on 5 Survivor Series Elimination Match] - This match wasn't much as it went back and forth various times until Luger was at a 3 on 1 disadvantage where we saw him trying to over come the odds but only for it to be shattered by King Kong Bundy's massive body splash in the end. 3.5/5

The Undertaker Vs. Yokozuna [Casket Match] - This was finality of the Undertaker's and Yokozuna's feud that started during their initial casket match back at the Royal Rumble earlier in the year that saw Yokozuna acquiring 10 men to defeat the Undertaker. But that wasn't the case here because actor Chuck Norris was brought in to prevent any interference. Unlike their Royal Rumble casket match, Undertaker and Yokozuna actually had a good match as the Undertaker is one of the few guys who can bring the best out of Yokozuna (who did a great job selling his fear of the casket). Chuck Norris' interaction in the match was minimum as he only kicked Jeff Jarrett in the face and nothing more before the Undertaker putting Yokozuna in his enternal rest home. 3.75/5

Overall, the only downside I can point out would be the Doink/Lawler match depending on your taste in comedy and in sports entertainment. But other than that, this was a solid Survivor Series line up and is recommended for a fair VHS price or for the Survivor Series Vol. 2 anthology price (which you get years 1996, 1995, 1993, & 1992 as well).",1284076800,,4386,4.625160462130937
7844945,5,6303288138,"Razor Ramon, Davey Boy Smith, 1-2-3 Kid, Sionne, Fatu, and British Bulldog VS Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart: A pretty good opening match. Diesel comes in and eliminates Fatu, 1-2-3 Kid, and Sionne with a jackknife power bomb in rapid succession. Bulldog is counted out and Razor is left solo. Diesel is putting on a good show and Michaels accidentally knocks out Diesel. Diesel then chases Michaels outside of the ring and the whole team follows him. A typical, stupid Survivor Series count out strikes again and ruins a good match.

Todd Pettingall (remember him?) tries to interview Michaels and he drives off. I'm loving the western attire Gorilla and Vince are wearing.

Jerry Lawler and 3 Midgets dressed as Lawler VS Doink and 3 Midgets as Doink: I cant belive the ovation Doink got when his music hit. I really hated Doink and Dink. I skipped this match because who the hell really cares about this?

Todd Pettingall with an awesome cowboy hat. I hear WWF is mad at the annoucers Situation; Well they should bring back this guy! He interviews the new womans champion and she doesnt speak english. Wow, this is some funny stuff. I should point out that this is being sarcastic.

Bob Backlund VS Bret Hart in a Submission match: A very long match. Owen gives his mother the towel to throw in as Bret is locked in a chicken wing submission. Backlund would lose the belt in 6 seconds a few days later to the new good guy Diesel.

Heavenly Bodies, Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, and King Kong Bundy VS Lex Luger, Mabel, Adam Bomb, and Smoking Gunns: Mabel puts on a good show but then gets eliminated via count out. Who the hell booked this events? I don't know if fans like watching count outs. Bam Bam Bigelow pins Adam Bomb with an awesome moonsault from the top rope. It was a very good match with a surprise win in the end.

Undertaker VS Yokozuna in a Casket match with Chuck Norris as the guest enforcer: Taker returns and beats Yoko in the Casket match as Norris fends off wrestlers who try to interfere. Not the best match i've ever seen but watchable.

The elimination matches were very good. The Hart-Backlund match was longer then any of the elimination matches and the ending was well done. The casket match was watchable but not main event material. I'd recommend watching this event.",1258070400,,2331,4.62953995157385
7844946,4,6303288138,"Once again thanks to WWE 24/7, I got to relive a classic Survivor Series in the 1994 edition that started to set up the Road To WrestleMania XI.

Bad Guys vs. Teamsters: Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid, British Bulldog, Headshrinkers (Samu & Sieone) vs. Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Owen Hart, Jim Niedhart, Jeff Jarrett - This was a good opener as it was well paced with various storylines being put over such as Headshrinker Fatu having trouble adjusting to being ""americanized"" by wearing wrestling boots.  The major storyline here was Diesel dominating & eliminating every member until Shawn Michaels (who was never tagged in the match) accidently kicked him in the face (for the third time since SummerSlam) and Diesel going after Shawn with his whole team being counted out in the process.  The ending was weak with Razor Ramon winning his match the same way Flair won his 3 years earlier but the bigger story was this was the HBK/Diesel story that would lead to the WM11 main event.

Clowns R' Us vs. Royal Family: Doink, Dink, Pink, Wink vs. Jerry Lawler, Sleazy, Queasy, Cheesy - This was a match where Doink & Lawler were actual wrestlers while the other teammates were midgets who dressed simliar to their team captain.  The rules were the it must be midget vs. midget/wrestler vs. wrestler at all times.  If you like midgets & find the actions of Doink The Clown funny, you'll like this one but if not...get the fast foward button ready.  Here's some food for thought though, since the rules were based the way they were...after Lawler eliminated Doink, how could the match end if all of of Lawler's midget teammates were eliminated since Lawler wasn't allowed to wrestle the midgets?  Just some food for thought.

Submission Match: WWF Champion Bret Hart vs. Bob Backlund - The rules for this match were similar to the rules of the Thunderdome Cage Match that happened back at NWA's Halloween Havoc in 1989, in which the only way the match could end was when the competitor's cornerman threw in their towel.  This match was tons better than their WrestleMania ""I Quit"" match & went 3 times as long.  Both men worked each other's bodyparts to set up their submission holds (Chickenwing crossface/Sharpshooter) thoughout the match.  The major highlight was when Bret Hart was in the chickenwing for around to 10 mins. while Bulldog was knocked out.  Owen Hart was crying & begging his parents at ringside to throw in the towel before Helen Hart did it.  Very dramatic ending for that time and without a doubt the highlight of Backlund's second run in the WWF.

Guts & Glory vs. Million $ Team: Bam Bam Bigelow, Tatanka, King Kong Bundy, Heavily Bodies (Tom Prichard & Jimmy Del Ray) vs. Lex Luger, Mabel, Smokin' Gunns (Billy & Bart), Adam Bomb - This was a nice back & forth elimination match as there really wasn't any special highlights or moments to look out for here but it was a solid matchup from beginning to end.

Casket Match: Undertaker vs. Yokozuna - Unlike their Royal Rumble match where it was just putting over a storyline, this was an actual match between the two.  They had actor/martial artist Chuck Norris at ringside to prevent others from interfearing like what happened at the Rumble but he didn't really do anything past kicking Jeff Jarrett in the chin.  The match went well as Undertaker can bring out the best of the biggest men in this sport & this match was no exception.  It's not a wrestling classic but it a good match to watch.

In the end, the only dud on here (depending on your taste) was the Doink/Lawler midget match but besides that, this was one of the best Survivor Series since the 1991 edition and I would recommend this VHS at a reasonable price.",1196208000,,3686,4.694099378881988
7844947,5,6303288138,"This Survivor Series was one of the most important pay-per-views that the World Wrestling Federation ever produced in my opinion. It seemed that this was the final piece of the magnificent masterpiece of ppv's the WWF put out in 1994. One thing that always stands out when I watch this event is the assignment of 5 supertstars to a team. In some previous years the WWF only stacked teams at Survivor Series with 4 guys. I've always liked the 5 person style better simply because it adds to the length of the match and allows for more combinations. The first match on the tape is the best one from the event, I feel. Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Double J Jeff Jarrett, the late great King Of Harts Owen Hart, and Owne's brother-in-law Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart comprised the Teamsters while Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon captained his Bad Guys team along with the late British Bulldog, 1-2-3 Kid, and the Headshrinkers Seoni and Fatu. Diesel gives one of the most dominant perfromances ever at Survivor Series as he nearly eliminates every one on Razor's team until HBK accidentally boots Diesel in the mush, immediately followed by Diesel chasing Michaels out of the Freeman Coliseum. Plus, Bret Hart vs. Bob Backlund in a Submissions Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. All in all, the best Survivor Series in history. If you buy it, you'll be glad you did-Guaranteed.",1176336000,,1381,4.8808510638297875

Freeman Coliseum

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Razor ramon, British Bulldog, 1-2-3 Kid, & Headshrinkers

V.

Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, & Jeff Jarrett

very good opener with a good story but Diesel eliminated everyone and the ending was very cheap with Ramon surviving. ***1/4

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Doink, Dink, Pink, & Wink

V.

Jerry Lawler, Queazy, Sleazy, & Cheezy

This is pretty the most funniest match that I think I have ever seen, but it was a DUD for sure with the whole Lawler team surviving and then Lawler getting his ass kicked by six midgets. What Fun.

Submission Match for the WWF Championship:

Bret Hart (Champion) V. Bob Backlund

This is one of the most underrated matches ever and it's one of my personal favorites. Awesome match with a awesome storyline. Backlund have Hart in the Crossface Chickenwing for litteraly ten minutes. What drama and what a match. Backlund wins the title. ****1/2

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Lex Luger, Mabel, Adam Bomb, & Smoking Gunns

V.

King Kong Bundy, Bam Bam Bigelow, Tatanka, & Heavenly Bodies

Good match that I think got a little too much time. Luger can't wrestle a long match even with Flair, let alone three men who can't wrestle in Bam Bam, Bundy, & the indian and two guys who can wrestle in the bodies. Bam Bam & Bundy survive. ***

Casket Match:

Undertaker V. Yokozuna

well...at least it was better than their match at the Rumble. Undie wins. **

Overall, a very good show with the WWF Title match being a classic.",1148083200,,1623,4.857142857142857
