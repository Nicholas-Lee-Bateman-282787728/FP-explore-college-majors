7119779,5,B00W3XNNE2,"Firstly, all of the pics you see added to this DVD review list are from us. Most were found with minimal research, while others were more exhaustive to locate. Many had been shut down or deleted some time ago. The goal in seeking these pics, some more elusive than others, was an attempt to back up the claims made in ""Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Revealed."" These claims sounded astonishing, and if factual, would change the course of human history as we know it. A deep desire to believe does not mean we will jump to catch every biscuit thrown. Sometimes, if it sounds too good, it really is! We found some literally shocking photos, especially the ""cigar-shaped Alien space ship"", out there concerning this documentary/film, that we decided to focus solely on the ""Alien woman"" story. For now...
I have absolutely always been a believer in life outside of what resides on the Earth. Be it microbial life hidden in some rocky material in or on meteoric formation. Or actual sentient, extraterrestrial Alien life with a higher intelligence that may be capable of greater than light speed. An Alien life than can traverse the stars with the ability to create or decimate any life it sees fit. Whether it is benevolent or malevolent, I choose to believe in the latter. In the highest hopes that this or these life-forms have surpassed any intentions for destruction, the extraterrestrial Aliens I believe exist, have, in our distant past, and will once again, make contact with humanity.

That being said, with a huge dose of skepticism, open-mindedness and objectivity, myself and 3 friends watched ""Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Revealed."" Initially, our goal was to see some truly amazing NASA photos that we had never seen before. We viewed this documentary/film together, several times and separately a few more, to gather our own unique opinions. From the beginning, the very first story, too many things were going on to absorb on a single viewing. Each of us were noticing different things with each set of clips. After years of seeing so-called, ""ultimate evidence"" and ""caught on tape"" documentary/films, ""Aliens on the Moon"" seemed, well, different. In order to attempt to better understand and examine what we had in front of us, on a very serious level, we set out to test this doc/film on it's own merits. None of us were on a debunking hunt. In fact, there was some extremely unique and compelling evidence presented in ""Aliens."" What we wanted to do, was attempt to clarify much of the spin that had been woven through the evidence presented, intertwined with the oratory skills advanced by the narrator, Roger Leopardi. If you are really interest in our findings, please read on. If you only seek a standard review, this one isn't for you.

We offer this initial, completely objective review of the most startling footage from ""Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Revealed"" as it was the most hyped and shocking piece presented. We tried to search as much facts connected to this event as we could. I refer to the ""female Aliens."" Depending on the ""helpful/not helpful"" votes, will guide us to release the entirety of the review on the whole of ""Aliens on the Moon"" that has already been prepared. As with anything else, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. The 4 of us found much more than this doc/film provided at all. We only aim to enlighten you as much as we were...
If you recall that ""Alien Autopsy"" video that made the rounds many years ago. How heavily scrutinized that was. From the surgical tools, the clock on the wall, down to the telephone in the room. All were attempted to be verified as ""time period"" appropriate of the late 1940's. Yet if this ""footage"" is true, any Alien life should hurry and arrive on the White House lawn soon, before the next Presidential election. As long as President Obama is in office, he is prepared to grant citizenship to ""Illegal Aliens."" Humanity is so quick to judge, to slow to accept.

 So here we have Joshua P. Warren, a Paranormal Investigator, open this segment. An introduction to finally watch what we had been teased with on several occasions throughout this doc/film. The sequence begins with classic footage of standard rocketry separation in high Earth orbit. A Saturn 5 type, first-stage falls away. The mystique begins with Leopardi saying, ""another craft is either following or trying to rendezvous with it."" Even though we just saw that very stage separation breakaway. He goes on to say, ""it's unclear what precisely going on and Rutledge hasn't clarified these peculiar shot images."" Actually, it was clear. Again, you all can see, the initial first-stage breakaway needed no further clarification. Then we are set up with what seems to be an ""Alien Woman."" Affectionately named, ""Mona Lisa"", she appears to be glazed over or ""mummified."" Possibly hibernating even. As Leopardi narrates, he lays out for us this scenario that 2 astronauts, William Rutledge and Leona Snyder and Soviet cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov, embarked on a joint U.S./S.U. Mission, Apollo 20, in August of 1976. A ""top-secret"" lunar undertaking to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, the existence of Alien life. Apparently a photo, (surprisingly much sharper than earlier ones), was taken from Apollo 15 depicting a ""cigar-shaped"" craft with a ""dome-shape"" above the left-hand side, plainly lying out on the surface of the moon near the Guyot Crater. (We verified) Described by Lee Spiegel, writer from the Huffington Post, as, ""miles"" long!

Now I offer you our own, (not to difficult), investigative work up to this point... (again, as objective as possible)
The Apollo program officially ended with Apollo 17. Apollo 18, 19 and 20 to the moon were scrubbed. Apparently due to ""financial and technical issues."" Warren admits to this fact. Is it possible the flights continued? I would like to think so, but have found nothing to confirm anything to support this. Now, in a few circles, the movie, ""Apollo 18"", had been accused as a ""misinformation"" endeavor to throw off later leaks of any sentient life found on the moon. Ergo, the Apollo 20 footage we are eating up. Doubtful but who knows.
Casting further doubt on this whole Apollo 20 mission are the names of crewmembers. Of the three, only Soviet cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov is a true, verifiable name. In 1965, he was the very first man to walk in space for 12 minutes, 9 seconds. Upon researching his authenticity, it turns out that at the time of this supposed Apollo 20 flight in 1976, he would have been 42 years old. This age was actually theoretically plausible. The ages of American astronauts who walked on the moon ranged from the youngest with Charles Duke at 36 and oldest, Alan Shepard at 49.

So, was Leonov actually a person seen in the clip on this footage? Who can tell? As for American astronaut Leona Snyder, she does not exist. There is no such name anywhere. That name doesn't show under NASA websites or archives we could find. Leona Snyder is more than likely, a fabricated name. So, all we have left is former-civilian test pilot, William Rutledge. Similarly to Warren's assertion, it is he who leaked this elaborate story with footage to the world in 2007. Interestingly, we found that Rutledge too is not a civilian test pilot nor an astronaut either. Along with Snyder, he is another enigma to NASA. We did locate a photo of a man seated, holding a patch resembling that same, ""U.S./S.U. Flag"", taped on the control board within the lunar module. But who can say if this is actually the man in question. So, how did this story come to be? In April of 2007, an Italian Ufologist by the name of, Luca Scantanburlo, interviewed a man claiming to be William Rutledge. Sharing that he had retired from the American Space program as a NASA Commander and was now residing in Rwanda. (Yeah, left us scratching our heads too.) His claim was that he had been the Commander of Apollo 20. Boasting that he had ownership of some astounding moon footage that was literally, other worldly. Yet the two men never met face-to-face. This interview was held via ""Yahoo Messenger.""
None of this information was shared on the doc/film, ""Aliens on the Moon."" Along with this interview, Rutledge spoke of how he and Leonov found remnants of a ""lunar civilization."" To boot, amongst the artifacts brought back to Earth, was a ""female Alien."" Suspiciously, Leona Snyder's name isn't mentioned again in the doc/film either. One might think that a famed cosmonaut such as Leonov would bolster this Earth shattering revelation, yet his name is also dropped from the conversation.

Redirect you back to the doc/film, as Leopardi is spinning this fantastical tale of universal importance, footage continues to roll. The film breaks up at first. Interestingly only over the ""female Alien"", but par for the course. More commotion. A few jumpy frames of what looked like a the nosecone of a (space ship?) outside the lunar module with that same ""domed shaped"" pilots cockpit, up close. So close that one can make out the framing of window panels. Hold on here? If you go back to the original Apollo 15 photo, look closely again, you can make out a similar but obscure ""dome shaped"" cockpit. Now the question becomes... If Lee Spiegel's assessment of the craft being ""miles"" long, then wouldn't it stand to reason that this ""dome shape"" should be at least 1 MILE? That's a very conservative number. Then we watch as Rutledge (or any of these astronauts) traverse the lunar surface toward the craft. By appearance, it no longer looks as imposing in the size and dimensions initially asset by Spiegel. Now it looks like the nose of a small airplane between two rocky outcroppings. Not the flat lunar surface depicted in the Apollo 15 photo. If you mute Leopardi's voice, you will see two very different scenes.
Bring that size back to the walk up clip, given the size of ""Mona Lisa"", proportional to a mans hand in a later shot next to her head, shouldn't ""Mona"" be at least 100 feet tall? The numbers and sizes do not add up. The 4 of us were extremely baffled at this point. We weren't dealing in conjecture or conspiracy. Merely what was on the Hi-Def screen in front of us! And you too, if you already own this. In all seriousness, we are maintaining as much objectivity as possible.
To close out this segment, it is toped off by this amazing turn of humanities life-changing events with a stunning shot of that """"ancient Alien cityscape structure."" Why, why would they just stop there? Why? And release just a few seconds of it? Compared to the dozens of minutes of blurry photos that required colorization and 3D rendered graphics for viewership understanding to be made out. None of these experts from their respective disiplines spoke with any analysis concerning this ""Alien city?"" As we saw it, we wanted to hear some commentary on those beautifully built arched, high-rise Alien towers. Something? Nothing. Leopardi goes on to say, ""the connection between NASA's Apollo 15 photo and the Rutledge footage makes a convincing connection to researchers."" Wait! Which researchers? No one spoke out! He then furthered, ""the 2nd Alien woman seems to be severed or not found in tact."" How can he possibly reach that conclusion? Purely by the fact that we see only a head shot? Does this then mean the 1st Alien, ""Mona Lisa"" was only a torso? I mean we saw no limbs. This is the kind of spin that creates those damaging ""ultimate evidence"" and ""caught on tape"" doc/films. It reduces any credible evidence to back seat, shadowy dealings because the entire phenomena already has it's critics.

Now we are left with the probable $3.4 Billion question. (final cost for the round trip for the Apollo 17 mission) Wasn't this still highly questionable, ""top-secret"" mission that was jointly flown, (during the cold-war), specifically for just this purpose? Compared to the multiple views of grainy photos with ""objects"" that required those multiple shots to be understood, then NOW decide to leave with ONLY few frames of spot on, drop dead, crystal clear proof of that astoundingly beautiful ""ancient Alien city"" exactly what the documentary set out for the public to finally know? Maybe it was our enthusiasm? But IF that WAS the mission, they found what feared might be there, and now coming forward with, give us more! Someone jump in here! An Alien city on the moon! Silence. not a word from any of the panelists. We are sure you too shared our frustration. I really want to believe, but several frames with no commentary and NO repeat of those frames? Unless...Rutledge, Snyder and Apollo 20 had all been deleted from every record and hidden. Neatly tucked away somewhere in a mud-brick hut in Rwanda, hunting and running with the Gazelle.

So, we've been hyped to see ""Mona Lisa"" and an apparent second female Alien. More of the usual shaking camera, (still couldn't spring for that steady cam yet out of those Billions of dollars spent), Even the thoughtfulness of Rutledge to turn the camera back upon himself for posterity sake!
Then we all see those two samples of ""Alien writing."" Where are the experts now? While a man such as Zecharia Sitchin, who famously broke the code of the ancient Sumerian texts concerning the Anunnaki, says nothing? Sure, he was considered a pseudoscientist and catstrophist, but he was respected for his work, and still alive at this time! It would have been great to hear views from him or others in this field. The point is, it appears that this was an agenda driven idea put forth by the Executive Producer, Writter and Director, Robert C. Kiviat and Co-Executive Producer, David Kiviat. (keep it in the family?)

Maybe this can be best summed up by the words spoken by Amy Shira Teitel, Space Flight Historian: {spoken during this segment}, she says, ""The idea that the Apollo 20 mission was going to recover something that had been seen in another NASA image from Apollo 15, I think gives credibility and gives that a morsel of truth you really want to latch onto and make it something you can really believe in.""

If you listen closely, she never committed herself to the ""Apollo 20 recovered footage."" Sure, she did hint at the, ""morsel of truth YOU really want to latch onto"" but not herself. A clever way to maintain her distance from the project, but adhere to the scripted dialogue and give the viewers what they hungered for. After this, not a single ""expert"" shared any opinion. After we did a bit of sleuth work, this being a small portion of our full review, a compilation of our finding in all I just wrote, there was no big surprises why.

This was, by no means, a scientific endeavor. Just 4 friends who truly believe in the Ancient Alien theory who sat through yet another doc/film containing some very profound photos. Along with these photos were way too many inconsistencies. Repetitive, overlapping dialogue from Leopardi that, at times, crossed the very professionals who contributed to the outing of this very project, ""Aliens on the Moon."". We realize this might spark conversation and debate amongst those who chose to read thus far. And this is a fantastic thing. Educate each other. There is so much that you can see on your own copies of this doc/film. All you need do is pay attention. Utilize the pause button. Rewind and re-watch. So much more is laid out in our entire review. One thing at a time first. But wasn't that the point of ""Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Exposed"" in the first place? The continuation of interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and Aliens, to keep us all looking up and wondering? Many of you have already spent the $19.99 to purchase this DVD. Some plan to. The goal was watching some really cool footage that you hadn't seen before. The producers gave you their point of view, we offer you another...

Its amazing that with todays technology pictures from the outer planets and their respective moons have far more resolution and quality than an object in our own backyard.  So the question is why? Why are moon photos so blurry even after 50 plus years? Can you imagine the excitement generated if the experts in this documentary really were able to have high resolution pictures to prove their point? Between all the highly credible military insiders, UFO/UAP conventions, and the release of government documents from all over the world, its easy to be disgusted with the military/industrial/extraterrestrial complex and their clampdown on the truth. I really don't think its about aliens anymore, but more about the loss of control of the sheeple by the governments, and the myriad of shadow government controllers controlling the governments.

3. The alleged NASA interviewee, whom is wearing a pilot's jacket that is covered with various logo patches, is NOT even an astronaut...or even a pilot!
4. The narrator concludes that all thinking and/or concepts that don't align with what is being proposed in this documentary is proof of an underlying conspiracy or cover up.

7119928,5,B00W3XNNE2,"Excuse my English, I'm not a native speaker.

I feel myself compelled to write this, because of the bad reviews, also on IMDB.
What exactly is ""your"" (the 1-2 star reviewers) problem? Some interviewees? The artificial
images? I do not think that these pictures of ""cannon"" and ""chimney""
are real. Do you think the people are so stupid? OK yes, they should
mention it.

I guess, the negative reviewers of this documentation only reject the
possibility of extraterrestrial visitors to earth generally. They are
very biased. Is that right? If yes, this is not a serious basis for a
bad review.

Perhaps, the documentation could have been ""better"". But I have nothing
to complain about the content of it.

Review this documentation only professionally, but not what they claim
sets up (""aliens exist"")!

According criminological and legal standards, the existence of
extraterrestrial visitors is proved. Physicists have not the privilege
of interpretation here.....

Physicists know only the current state of knowledge of mankind. When
physicists say extraterrestrial visitors, Ufos with exotic drive etc.
are impossible, this violates the scientific principles. At the end of
the 19th century, a physicist at the Royal Society in UK has claimed
that a machine never will fly. A few years before the brothers Wright.
And the professor of young Heisenberg (or Plank?) said, all important
knowledge in physics is discovered.

If someone kills your family, and there is only one eye witness, you
would believe him (or not?). Why? Where is the ""hard proof""?!? DNA,
video...

Would you see it as ""proof"", in case of 200 close eye witnesses? See
the Westall high school incident:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1CBouzER5o

In science this is called ""Axiom"". You know, ""it is so"" (here 200
witnesses as evidence), but you do not know ""how"" (the natural science
background). But you have to accept it.

Or the ""Phoenix Lights"", or the ""Belgium Ufo wave/flap"". Are these
witnesses all untrustworthy ""crazy"", ""nutty"" or ""insane"" people?
Absolutely impossible... In phoenix (or a suburb) a airline pilot
(""Trick Johnson""?) says, he could had land on a Ufo, so big it was (1
to 2 miles). A triangular shaped Ufo.

For example, two federal Belgium police officers who testify adamantly,
there were two extraterrestrial flying objects over the Gileppe dam
(over one hour). Possibly car size, and with dome. And many civil and
military witnesses. General Wilfried Brouwer has said, these are
extraterrestrial flying objects with Aliens.

A ""sceptical"" is not a radical fundamentalist (only ""against""). A real
""sceptic"" person accept also the possibility of extraterrestrial
visitors. Based on the serious witnesses (in the few good close
incidents).

Did you know, Hillary Clinton is a ""Ufo-Geek"". She firmly believes
firmly in the existence of extraterrestrial visitors. That's a tough
serious topic. Not ""Entertainment"". Provocative example, ""children with
cancer"", ""Poverty"" etc. are not more important.

Like Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton want to politically enforce
disclosure. Bill has quickly abandoned. If she became president, I hope
she makes political pressure. Trying to create a law to disclose.
Citizens were probably behind her. Perhaps also both houses of
congress.

If aliens visiting Earth, then bases on the moon only logical.

The ""National Aeronautics and Space Administraion"" is not a independent
civil institution. Look the public founding act. The Pentagon can
prohibit publications of alien artifacts or spaceships etc. on moon, in
orbit etc.. Can also command retouching of photos. This is the legal
fact. And fact is, this is, what the Pentagon would do.

Would it officially announced, there would be a moon run by the private
sector and foreign military to the moon. In order to recover the
technology and copy it.

I think, people, Non government groups and companies like Robert
Bigelow, Mutual UFO Network, Hillary Clinton, James Cameron, media
companies like Sony, Time Warner etc., should collect money
(crowdfunding, venture capital ...) and launch a lunar mission. Even
without evidence of extraterrestrial activity or even buildings that
would be a media success (documentations, IMAX, BluRays, Pay-TV...).
Brodcasted in with real scientists. They would work ""for less"".
""win-win-win-win"" for the media companies, the science, the truth and
the mankind..... Even without ""aliens"", they can research, and the
audience can see it live.

Companies such as TV stations, media networks, etc. are more
trustworthy than ""National Aeronautics and Space Administraion"". These
companies make money with the sensation, when they find something. They
not interested in covering up. The Pentagon already rather.",1450915200,,4718,5.4032697547683926

I also don't understand the bad reviews. Very thought provoking - no matter what worldview you subscribe to. Hard to argue with former astronauts, NASA officials, and photographs from the NASA archives. There is all kinds of anomalous information on the moon and at least Mars that is being obscured for all of the obvious reasons.

7120025,1,B00W3XNNE2,"As a documentary I would give this zero stars if that was possible.  However, their entire presentation is SO slanted that it is laughable, so it does have some value as a comedy.

Their primary evidence for alien structures on the moon are photographs that NASA shot in the 1960's.  That's fine.  BUT ... then they zoom in on a teeny tiny portion of these photographs, far beyond the point where the photos become blurry.  Then they tell you that they are ""clearly showing"" artificial structures on the moon.  To help the viewer along they have colored a portion of the photograph to show the ""structure"" they are talking about.  The entire ""documentary"" is simply a parade of blurry images that you could make into almost anything.  It is the ""face"" at Cydonia all over again.  Yes, in the original, low resolution, photographs it does vaguely resemble a face.  However, the new, higher resolution, photos show clearly that it is not.  The few times they do present a new photograph of an area in question it clearly does not show the alien structure they were talking about.  Then they proclaim that is ""proof"" that NASA has tampered with the photos.

Furthermore, every scientist they interviewed about the photos was ""mystified"" or ""baffled"" by what they were seeing.  Meanwhile the ""researchers"" (their term for UFO buffs) all see them as ""iron clad proof"" of alien structures on the moon.  Also, Buzz Aldrins refusal to comment on their photographs is presented as proof that he is working with NASA to cover things up.

My favorite part of the whole thing was when one of the ""researchers"" said that the ""wheel-like structures"" that they are seeing could be power generators because they look like the rebel power generators in the Empire Strikes Back.  Seriously!  I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair!  And these guys wonder why scientists don't take them seriously.

They wrap the whole thing up with a look at video from the Apollo 20 mission  which they admit they got from the internet!  Nothing on the internet has ever been faked, Right?  Supposedly, the video was not just shot but also posted by one of the astronauts aboard a joint USA / USSR mission to the far side of the moon.  We are expected to believe not only that the thousands of people involved in building and launching a Saturn V rocket kept their silence about three additional lunar missions but, also that we were willing to work with the USSR on the project (during the cold war) and they kept silent about it as well.  The video goes on to show an alien body that looks like a bad mannequin; honestly, I have seen much better bodies is a lot of B-grade horror movies.  It is truly laughable.

As a documentary about proof of aliens on the moon this movie stinks.  It is slanted and has no real evidence to talk about.  As a documentary about how some people will see what they want to see no matter what the evidence, it is kind of interesting.

P.S. - As part of my job for the last fifteen years I have spent many, many hours drawing maps from aerial photographs.  I can tell you from experience that when you zoom in too much on a photograph it becomes possible to draw almost anything you want.  I have seen what I thought were buildings in the photographs only to go out to the project site and find that light and shadow were tricking me, there was nothing there.  I would not call myself an expert in photo analysis but I do have a lot of experience in the field.",1436054400,15,3467,4.531400966183575

The Y axis is the number of people getting that score and the results always form this bell shape with the most people in the center with the highest number of people getting this score. This is called the average IQ. For every test ever taken of large groups of people, the average is around 100, the average IQ. Now to the right of the average are people who are smarter than average and to the left, people who are slower and less capable. The farther you go right you approach genius.

Also, a pretty much one sided examination of the evidence.
Oh, and taking clips of interviews out of context just shows how dishonest the makers of this trash really are.",1431734400,2,486,4.415730337078652

Look up look around we are not alone. I believe the government has been to the moon and still continues to visit the moon. Skeptics wouldn't believe their own eyes!

8712022,3,B00W3XNNE2,"Some of these photos I remember growing up and watching live news of moon landings. This inspired me later to join the Air Force and as I saw things around nuclear bomber bases I suspected wasn't ours, even if I never saw the little green men, I wondered where they (UFOs) came from. I do remember discussing with officer's on a flight mission (which I have photos of from the 70s), things we saw, monitored on radar, and photographed, we never spoke of again outside the aircraft nor to any Air Force official. This would have ruined careers, and we knew they would have told us we saw swamp gas or weather balloons, even though they were moving at 4,000 mph and making 90 and 180 degree turns at that speed. So, I've only seen ""Weather Balloons"" acting unnaturally. For this video, 3 stars just due to the same photos with different people repeating the same information over, and over, and over.....I did stop it after about the 15th repeat with nothing new to add and the annoying brainwashed so called scientist and Buzz Aldrin, that I once respected, playing dumb or giving the standard NASA or US government briefed answer. The thing is, including Buzz Aldrin, in the 60s and 70s NASA didn't delay the broadcasts being transmitted back from from Moon missions. So national news and HAM Radio operators clearly heard the astronauts radio back, We have a bogie. For those of you not Air Force, that means unknown or known hostile aircraft. They saw it, reported it, and photographed it. After the incident, NASA uses time delay in rebroadcast and encrypted radio frequencies since. This limits their astronauts blurting out radio calls for all to hear on Earth. Just mathematics of the amount of stars and galaxies in our own known universe tells me the odds are we are not the only ones out here, and others are trillions of years ahead of us in technology. I have no doubt they were and are worshipped as gods by the brainwashed masses that don't see the technology in their own religion and just blindly believe in the superstitions. I remember a news story from the Roswell crash from the Rancher that found the ""Weather Balloon"" on his property in 1947. He Said: ""You know them little green men you hear about? They ain't green."" Jesse Marcel in the photos with the weather balloon material, admitted decades later, it was staged and swapped out for what he really found. Nah, our government won't lie to us? Nor the military recruiter when he cons you to signing away all your rights and work for the military. Buzz Aldrin is government brainwashed and will stick to the script never revealing the truth taking what he knows to his grave.",1500595200,4,2649,4.662393162393163
