2453778,5,B000C6NOY6,"I bought this because I fell in love with Misha in Supernatural as Castiel, an Angel. Since he played several characters in SPN and I loved them all, bought this movie. The story kept me interested and I have watched it several more times. Was not disappointed in Misha, so I will continue to sing his praises.",1326931200,7,310,4.456140350877193
2453779,5,B000C6NOY6,"I originally purchased this film because I knew Misha Collins was in it. I had no idea what a good movie it really was. I had never heard of a lot of the actors in it before, except Misha Collins, and I was surprised at how talented every actor and actress was. Finding Home was such a breath of fresh air for me. There wasn't any swearing, and there wasn't a lot of violence, there was some, not much. It was just a good movie all together!",1268784000,6,441,4.080459770114943
2453780,4,B000C6NOY6,"It was a pleasant surprise to watch.  The acting was easy & casual and the scenery took me back to my childhood days in Vermont.

The storyline was simple and direct..

Sit back with some popcorn and just relax..",1170806400,2,212,4.384615384615385
2453781,5,B000C6NOY6,"Got this on dvd and the first copy skipped froze and was just unwatchable.  The new copy was pixelated and very cheap looking with fuzzy outlines when the characters would move about.  Yet the case looks real.

Are there 2 versions out there?  My case had only one disc, yet I see Amazon says there are 2 discs.  someone help me out?  I want to see this movie but can't bear to watch the distracting bad? copy that I have,

Help!

anyone?",1170288000,,438,4.2560975609756095
2453782,4,B000C6NOY6,"Just finished watching this movie and it put me in a very reflective mood.  I actually watched it because I saw that Louise Fletcher was in it, and have always thought that she is an exquisite actress.  She brings a very sublime quality to every role I've ever seen her in that not many actresses can, even if they are small parts.  I also read two reviews wherein the reviewer[s] wondered if this was a 'chick flick' - I didn't view it as that type of movie at all.

I would also have to agree with the one negative review I saw here that perhaps the acting chops were not first rate.  The performances by Lisa Brenner and Sherri Saum were perhaps not as stong as they could have been, but they were not that bad either.  The performances by Genevieve Bujold and Louise Fletcher were excellent.

Besides, the scenery and the slow unfolding of the story through flashbacks was like the waves from the beach washing over you - it more than made up for less than stellar performances.

And the final narration at the end of the film:  ""Life always comes full circle and love is the ultimate forgiveness"" will stay with me for a long time.

Give this film a shot - I believe it will stay with you too.",1170028800,11,1198,4.331838565022421
2453783,5,B000C6NOY6,"I am writing this review from a culture that experiences more emotional extremes (between love and hate) than any other place in the world, Jerusalem.  I found myself looking for a movie to watch this morning that could return me back to the safety and security I know in America, if just for a couple hours, when I ran across this one.

""Finding home"" is a great wake-up call for what's really important in life.  The acting is great, the setting is heart-warming, and the story line flows in perfect sequence from one scene to the next.  It is also a mixture of the good and bad we experience in life and that also exists in each one of us.  I wouldn't call it a chick-flick but you should get out of your head and into your heart if you want to get the most out of it.  The challenges experienced in the lives of the characters portray a response that demonstrates the way we should all live our lives.  Of course forgiveness is the is the main theme but there are other lessons to be learned as well; the importance of  ones legacy through family, material insignificance, restraint from judgement of others, patience, kindness, even the importance of education if you look a little deeper.  It is full of  the subtle insights into life that can make or break our search for happiness and fulfillment.

I will certainly pass this film on to both friends and family members and I only wish it had subtitles in both Arabic and Hebrew so I could  pass it on to non-English speakers here.  I agree with the other reviewer that ""It is a shame this film never got the promotion that it could have"" and hence never made it into the public eye.  I had to come to Israel to discover it and never heard of it before.  At the end of the day I have to say it is truly a  ""Diamond in the Ruff"".",1152230400,10,1785,4.299401197604791
2453784,4,B000C6NOY6,"Hi. If you are reading this review, then you probably already have found this ""sleeper"" and are looking to own to dvd - that's what happened to me. Having watched it through twice in the past twelve hours - once alone and once with my wife (and yes, she cried near the ending), this film goes well beyond being another ""chick flick."" The social themes are there, but underlying them I found a powerful uindercurrent of a theme - forgiveness and reconciliation. In the end, I found that THAT was the ultimate theme (and hope) of the film.

One of the aspects of the film I find interesting is the author's use of names. For example Amanda (lovable) and David (beloved) end up being the two protagnists in the film. Grace (which means grace), one of the antagonists is ironically anything but grace-filled but rather has a bitter quality to her life and personality. The other antagonist in the film, Nick (victory of the people), attempts to sow his seed upon anything that moves as he drowns in his self-glorifying ego.

Overall, once said and done this film is powerful and worthy of being in one's dvd collection. It is a shame this film never got the promotion that it could have - society would be a better place if we'd begin to live out the movie's theme.

2453785,1,B000C6NOY6,"I see that the only other reviewer of this movie thought it was fantastic and gave it 5 stars. I give it 1 star because the screenplay seemed to me as though it was written by a third-rate romance novelist. The acting was pretty bad too, especially by the lead actress (I don't remember her name.) She struck me as a soap opera wannabe. The only bright spots were the scenery and Genevieve Bujold. I was surprised to see her in such a crappy movie. If you watch it and think it is as crappy as I do, be sure to watch the ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette. It was kind of funny listening to the director and some of the actors smoozing over what a great and wonderful movie they think they made. I think it telling that Ms. Bujold did not participate in this self congratulatory exercise. She knows.",1144886400,3,795,4.306666666666667
2453786,5,B000C6NOY6,This movie so so great. Working on Deer Isle where it was made it was such a pleasure to see local beauty done in such a wonderful way.  I have passed the movie on to many friends who have all agreed that it's wonderful.,1142467200,3,220,4.0

2453791,5,B000C6NOY6,I adore this movie. Its feel-good and quaint and something I really needed for the stage I'm at in my life. I really recommend it.,1389657600,,130,4.24
2453792,5,B000C6NOY6,Honestly I bought this because Misha Collins is in it but it turned out to be a very nice film. Finding Home tells a sweet story and the acting is very good. It arrived early and in great condition!,1381795200,,198,4.102564102564102
2453793,3,B000C6NOY6,The story started out a little bit confusing but did mostly clear up as the story went on. Johnny Messner gave a good performance as usual,1375574400,,138,4.346153846153846
2453794,5,B000C6NOY6,"I first heard of this movie from my boyfriend, who loves everything to do with Misha Collins almost more than I do. We couldn't find anywhere to watch it online, and he had already seen it, so he told me to just buy it because I would want to watch it more than once. He was right. This movie is one of the most beautiful, if not one of the most frustrating movies I've ever seen. The story is beautiful, the characters are beautiful, and Misha Collins is beautiful. I don't know why many people who are fans of his don't talk about this movie, but they need to. It's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen and I would recommend it to everyone, whether they like this type of movie or not.",1374451200,4,697,4.17037037037037
2453795,4,B000C6NOY6,"I'll be honest, I bought this because of Misha Collins. But I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't as 'Lifetime Movie Channel Presents:' as I was afraid of. Sure, the plot was a bit predictable and sometime painfully slow, but the acting was good and I never got jarred out of the movie. For those who like quiet, understated drama with a happy resolution, this one is definitely a keeper.",1360368000,,395,4.577464788732394
2453796,5,B000C6NOY6,One of the best feel good movies I have ever seen. I was surprised how well the characters looked together and found Misha Collins delightful.,1359590400,,142,4.72

8096112,4,B000C6NOY6,"This movie is a little gem, and I'm glad I discovered it. The story follows Amanda, and most of it unfolds from her perspective (which allows the mystery surrounding David's character, and her grandmother's residence, to be subtly palpable for most of the movie). There is something about this romantic human-drama, that makes it memorable. I think what makes this movie standout is its sincerity, setting, and atmosphere. This also has a happy ending. I liked Amanda and David, and the assorted characters around them were interesting as well. However I thought that the reunion between Amanda and David towards the end of the movie, should've been more emotional. Also there easily could've been a few more intriguing interactions between Amanda and David, before the reunion, but alas that didn't happen. However the movie as a whole remains a pleasant surprise for me, and I solidly liked it.",1480982400,,896,5.0608108108108105
8096113,5,B000C6NOY6,I loved the story - the characters and the way was filmed - very costly and realistic. All behind the scene and directors discussion are really interested - example:to learn that to give the accuracy to the scenes from 1940 flashbacks they even got the lipstick from a museum..,1474502400,,277,4.673469387755102

8096115,5,B000C6NOY6,"While it does have its flaws, and I would say it's maybe a few steps up from a ""Lifetime Original movie"" (not that there's anything wrong with those lol), I found myself enjoying it more than I thought I would.

The negative reviews I felt were being a bit overly critical. It wasn't nearly as bad and I think it's worth a watch.

I'm finding that every Misha Collins movie I have seen thus far have all been unexpectedly better than anticipated.

I would love to own most of them (aka all of them except Karla). Sadly two of them aren't available on DVD (Par 6 and Moving Alan, both really good and highly recommended!)

So yeah, this movie was charming despite its faults and is worth a watch I think!",1474070400,,703,4.343511450381679

was going on.  I did not like it!!",1470873600,,154,3.78125
