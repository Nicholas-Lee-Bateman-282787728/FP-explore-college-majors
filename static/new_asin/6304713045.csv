7876138,3,6304713045,"Ultraman has had more spinoffs than any other TV series, so it obviously had to get an anime adaptation. It was redone as an animated series in the late 70s and early 80s by Sunrise who at the time was also doing the first Gundam TV series. The series itself wasn't released in English on its own, but the first four episodes were dubbed for an American release as a compilation film.

 Set in the future, a strange message from space is seen all over the world written in the sky in an ""alien"" language. What it was really from the alien hero Ultraman who tries to warn mankind of changes happening to the Earth. He ends up fusing with an astronaut who joins up with a special scientific task force that is assembles select soldiers to handle these new threats to the Earth. The four parts of this movie have some random monster show up, and Ultraman intervenes to stop them. The best of which is in the first one where he takes on four frost-breathing Godzilla clones. He also fights a living tornado! But as usual, his greatest weakness is he can only stay in his giant form for a few minutes before exposure to Earth's sun kills him, like he's a Reverse-Superman or something.

 This movie was one of the first anime titles to be release at the dawn of the DVD boom in the 90s, and features some decent animation for the time. The giant monster fight sequences as disasters are exceptionally well done. If you happen to find a place to rent this or in a bargain bin, definitely give it a look. It's a shame that the American production of Ultraman: The Adventure Begins pilot movie done in part by Hanna-Barbera hasn't been released out here yet.",1424304000,,1650,4.435643564356436

This is the first animated ultraman show (There were 2 others) There had been about 7 Ultraman shows, and a couple of movies and TV specials, before this.  It was released around 1981-2 when anime space dramas such as Yamato (STARBLAZERS) were popular. The series was called ""THE ULTRAMAN"" and the main character is called ""ULTAMAN JOE"" (short for ""JONEAS"") who comes from a lost colony of Ultras who live on an asteroid/planet they call ""ULTRANA"" disguised as toga wearing, man sized, humanoids. They transform by placing a jeweled star on their heads.

The basic plot of the first season is the same

monster-of-the-week episodic show as the live action Ultraman shows. This DVD is the first four episodes dubbed into english. JOE ""merges"" with a human space pilot

named Scotty ""Harris"" Harrison. He turns into ULTRAMAN JOE, who is mostly red, but with a silver face, whenever a new monster appears.

The monsters featured in this video are all original creations, but JOE battled animated versions of the traditional UltraKaiju, Like Baltan and Redking in later episodes, which unfortunately, have never been released here.

This is called ""ULTRAMAN 2"" because an earier movie called ""THE ADVENTURES OF ULTRAMAN"" was released first.

""THE ADVENTURES OF ULTRAMAN"" was edited from the second season (which means that it take place after ULTRAMAN 2: The Adventure Begins) and had a more straightforward, less episodic feel, since the second season was serialized.

The plot was  a Star Wars type pace opera and featured many silver and red Ultramen and women in a gigantic space battle against invading alien space cruisers. There is only one monster to fight, really, and its a doozy.

Both were released straight to video (VHS) in the early eighties.  ""ADVENTURES OF ULTRAMAN"" has never been released to DVD.

Though animated here, a live action version of ULTRAMAN JOE showed up in later live action ULTRAMAN specials (such as ""The Life Story of Ultraman Zoffy"") played by the traditional Man-in-suit.

Yes. The animation isn't Akira, But I don't think thats a fair standard to hold this to.

Its as good as any other TV anime from 1970-83. Its on a par with the Go Nagai (""Force Five: The Shogun Warriors"" in the U.S.) shows. With the animation being a little weak here in these first 4 episodes. Remember, this was the first attempt to do an animated ultra. They got MUCH better later.",1153353600,12,2465,4.920289855072464
7876142,4,6304713045,"look people, this is 60's animation! what did you expect, rich animation and awesome stories? if you start watching this expecting AKIRA, you will be dissappointed. however if you watch this expecting speed racer, you will enjoy it.  besides, its Ultraman for goodness' sakes!",1080432000,7,276,5.2727272727272725
