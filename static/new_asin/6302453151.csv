That really is what makes this movie from being really good.
Esther is great as always but I just can't buy her chasing the jerk in this movie.

465675,5,6302453151,"Upfront admission - I adore her.  MGM were coerced by the Navy to do a  ""recruitment"" movie, extolling the virtues to young American women that a life in the navy would be fun.  And so it seems.  MGM threw in everything.  This has a fun script, great stars, and - considering the story has no show-biz connections - terrific production values and catchy songs.

Esther once said in an interview that the character she played in this movie most  closely approximated her real self.  She certainly sails (or swims) through this movie with the utmost panache.  She has two highlight swimming sequences, both beautifully integrated into the plot.  Vivian Blaine and Barry Sullavan give solid support.  This stands as a masterpiece
of needs (a recruitment movie) meeting MGM's entertainment standards.  And everyone gets full marks.",1372550400,6,827,5.044444444444444
465676,5,6302453151,I love this movie! I like looking at all the different costumes and I really like the swimming scene with the two little kids and Esther so cute.,1370131200,,145,4.214285714285714
465677,4,6302453151,"I am glad more of Esther Williams movies are on DVD now. I am a big fan of hers and Vivian Blaine. Overall I thought this was a good movie, how Esther character went from a spoiled brat to a woman. Also Joan Evans went from a spineless crybaby to a woman who stood up for herself. I loved the song ""it takes a lot of water to make a Wave"" it was so funny. However what I disliked about the movie was the fellows. The way all of them were acting right throught the end just made me think why do these women want them anyway. When they finally get the girls and are at the train station to see them off they were falling over the Wacs, like the girls couldn't see them through the window. I would recommend this to any one who wants to expand there collection of Esther Williams movies.",1366070400,,784,4.064516129032258

465729,5,6302453151,"A FANTASTIC MOVIE... which I first seen as a young man in Hollywoods Golden Years the 1940 s.... so for I have managed to source  160 of these musicals, my wife & me, LOVE THEM....  were  in our 80th years... but films like this make you feel young again...

All these Musical STARS were dynamic personalities in real life: I am speaking from my experiences, I spent Forty years CHASING MOVIE STARS... as a living & hobby,
I visited very... very many of them out in California... and it was beyond my wildest dreams meeting them....

I eventually wrote a book about my experiences, entitled HIGHWAY TO HOLLYWOOD,
it contained 1200 photographs and 500 pages... all factual stories.

This was my tribute to them STARS who treated me as a STAR..

I met Esther Williams  in London at a Funds raising Dinner in 1999, along with a huge contingent of MGM STARS .... what a nite to REMEMBER......",1328572800,9,888,4.575949367088608

465731,2,6302453151,"Stuck with a turkey script--a sort of reverse ""On The Town"" with three waves trying unsuccessfully to land a sailor during a brief fun break--MGM brought in Debby Reynolds and Bobby Van to do a frantic dance number, Keenan Wynn to introduce himself (!), an old guy (inevitably called Pops) to add time to the film, the De Marco sisters to sing, and jazz crooner Billy Eckstine.  The minute and a half with Eckstine is wonderful, but the rest of the film is embarrassingly bad. The swimming numbers and lousy songs were low budget, the ""training camp"" Wave scenes were ridiculous, the acting...well, let's just say that Barry Sullivan was miscast and Vivian Blaine had already done all that in ""Guys and Dolls.""  Oh yes, and you have to see Keefe Brasselle trying to sing!  Taken as a satire on Esther Williams movies, this might be enjoyable to a few.  Otherwise, it might help to get drunk before hitting ""Play.""  Better yet, avoid this stinker.  No wonder it didn't make DVD.",1292025600,,977,4.684210526315789
465732,5,6302453151,I grew up knowing many of the old classics. This one has to be a top 10 on the list! I bought it for my mom and we never stop watching it. Any movie with Esther Williams is a classic time piece that should be in your home!,1255564800,8,222,3.6458333333333335
465733,5,6302453151,"This movie isn't terribly accurate as to actual Boot Camp life, but it was filmed at Great Lakes Naval Station about 10 years before I was stationed there in 1962-3.  The barracks, the furnishings, everything in the background shots look just the way they did when I was there.  I thoroughly enjoy this movie everytime I watch it just for the memories!",1184371200,16,352,4.661290322580645
465734,5,6302453151,"Skirts Ahoy! is an engaging and wholesome film for the entire family. It has romance, comedy, big stars, music, and patriotism!
Though this charming and genuinely entertaining tale of lovelorn naval waves was never a box office blockbuster, make no mistake, there were a lot of ""heavy weights"" attached to this picture. So...here is a little trivia lesson. In addition to the hugely successful stars of the day, Vivian Blaine, Debbie Reynolds, and Esther Williams,the M.G.M. box office queen at the time, Skirts Ahoy was produced by the hugely successful Joe Pasternak. Mr. Pasternak's eclectic productions range from ""Jumbo"" with Doris Day and Jimmy Durante to ""Spinout"" with Elvis Presley.
Mr Pasternak produced several films with Doris Day, who by the way, was another M.G.M. box office queen. Skirts Ahoy was directed by Sidney Lanfield, who would go on to direct T.V. classics like Burke's Law, McHale's Navy, and The Addams Family. The film's choreographer was Nick Castle. Castle choreographed many Martin and Lewis films in the 50's and nearly every Jerry Lewis movie in the 60's. Some of his T.V. credits include The Andy Williams Show and the pilot episode of ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh In!"" Now, for the die hard trivia buffs...Nick Castle is the father of director Nick Castle Jr., whose films include The Boy Who Could Fly, The Last Starfighter, Dennis The Menace, and Mr. Wrong with Ellen Degeneres, to name a few. Castle Jr. is also the screenwriter of the futuristic cult film, ""Escape From New York"" directed by John Carpenter. Nick Jr. got his ""break"" in the business playing the psychotic killer, Michael Myers, also credited as ""The Shape"" in the break out horror film ""Halloween"", also directed by John Carpenter. So you see, this little sailor movie has some impressive roots!
My favorite scene in Skirts Ahoy is the Five DeMarco Sisters singing ""What Good Is A Gal Without A Guy""
Are these girls gorgeous? Yes!
Is their harmony brilliant? Yes!
Am I prejudiced? Yes!
And why? Because I am proud to say that the Five DeMarco Sisters are my beautiful and amazingly talented mother and aunts.
Does that make my accalades any less true? No!
Take a moment and turn up the volume when my gloriously gifted family sings ""The Navy Waltz"" with the Men's Chorus, if this harmonious nod to our service men and women does not stir your soul, then call the ship's doctor...cause you got heart trouble!
The DeMarco Sisters have a new CD entitled ""It's Been A Long, Long, Time"". This CD features 29 fantastically arranged songs with a pure and powerful harmonic sound that will leave you breathless! A sound that my brother Stephen and my sister Jamie were privileged to enjoy for many years.
To wrap up my review...add Skirts Ahoy to your film library. It's a nifty, naval, musical that will take your cares AWEIGH!

465735,3,6302453151,"This film contains the single attempt of MGM to bring Billy Eckstine to the silver screen, though the plot line stalls and the dialogue is silly, Mr ""B"" delivers a true knockout punch in his scene as a night club singer.

465736,4,6302453151,"First saw this movie while in WAVE Boot Training, Fall 1952, at Bainbridge NRTC. How we laughed at what was supposedly bootcamp! My fondest memory, the talent show, with the songline ""You Gotta give me Water, 'Cause a Whole lot of water makes a WAVE!"" A fun reminder of those days.",1118534400,9,281,4.529411764705882
465737,5,6302453151,"Esther Williams AKA The Million Dollar Mermaid stars in this MGM musical where she among other young ladies join the Navy.  Although this film wasn't on a high budget, done by a popular director, or had alot of popular actors, Esther uses her charm to pull the movie together and bring the classic boy meets girl story to life!
Esther plays Whitney Young who leaves her fiance at the alter and joins the Navy.  There she meets two other young ladies who are also having trouble with love.  One was left at the alter, and one just can't be in the right place at the right time.
They decide they want to travel the world and forget about men altogether, that is until Whitney meets and falls in love with her Lt. Commander.  From then on, all she wants to do is win him over whatever the cost.  The other two girls play out their own stories of how they find happiness.
No Esther Williams movie would be complete without a swimming scene, and this film is no exception.  Esther joins two young children in the pool and creates a very cute performance with some great little swimmers complete with a toy ladder and sailboat.
Just when the girls think they are going to give up, each find their happiness in a corny, but almost tearful conclusion.  I really enjoy this film when I want to get away from it all.  Skirts Ahoy! may not have been a blockbuster hit, but it definitely is an enjoyable film that can be watched over and over again.",1088208000,34,1437,4.39622641509434
