I love true teachers. I was inspired by mine and they will stay in my heart always. I also remember the really bad ones, from the scary-mean, 'I hate kids' kind to the math teacher in Ventura, CA who announced at the beginning of our Freshman year that as long as we didn't act out and give him 'trouble', he'd give us an automatic C grade, even if we never completed homework or raised a pencil in class.

I loved this film. I wish I could get it on DVD to distribute to friends and family. I hope that this review will encourage you to download The Cartel. Not to be rude but if you aren't enraged after watching and are not at all inclined to tell others to download the film, then you didn't really pay attention. (I sure hope that you ARE, however, already baffled, maybe even p*ssed off by America's sickening report card!)

The future of America's children is not threatened by terrorism, pollution, drugs, under age sex and the world of crime. Wall Street got yer goat? Pfft! We didn't even notice the wool that was FIRST pulled over our eyes! The real threat stems from our current public education school system, within the Department of Education, at the Teachers' Union. Honorable institutions, right? HERE is where the Big Bad Wolf lurks. It's the first place we encounter undeniable corruption in our lives and it's the last place parents would look for it.

If you're reading the description to this film, then you've already begun to suspect or of have some knowledge of the real danger of being unaware and misinformed. Don't let anyone tell you differently, what you will see in The Cartel applies to every school district, NO child is left out.",1377129600,,1805,4.578947368421052
