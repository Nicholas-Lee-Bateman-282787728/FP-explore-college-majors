If they haven't high-tailed it out your door within 15 minutes, pray for a visit from Freddy.",1274486400,14,301,3.9508196721311477
3778149,1,B001RP974W,"I don't even know how to explain this, because I've never seen it before. Simply, I didn't find a single actor to act well in this movie, although it was not a low budget movie. My boyfriend just said that they wrote ""Looking for low budget actors"" for the casting. If you liked ""Legally Blonde"" don't watch this one, they have nothing in common. By the way the camera guy shooting during the landscape scenes is great, but the one that shoots during people talk obviously doesn't know how to hold the camera. So obviously it was the worst movie I've seen in a lot of time and I regret I choose to watch this one instead of ""Disaster movie""

3778150,5,B001RP974W,"i like this movie. it's seems decent and it seems like it's more for younger viewers. i do think that the original was more funnier, though. it's really cute that one twin wears dark pink and the other wears light pink. they look really pretty. they are like the mini versions of paris hilton. they even have little chihuahuas as pets just like her! and i love their british accents. sounds so posh and well-mannered.",1269129600,,417,4.573333333333333

I love their sexy British accents... ;-)

Produced by the Original ""Legally Blonde"" (Elle Woods) Reese Witherspoon herself, this delightful comedy tells of her distant UK relations, Annie and Izzy Woods, who were given the chance to study in the USA on a partial scholarship. It tells of their misadventures with a jealous schoolmate as they try to fit into the clique-obssessed elite school culture. The story culminates in a school courtroom scene whereby one of the UK sisters is tasked to defend her sister and a male schoolmate of theft and cheating at a school exam (test?). All went went as the jealous female schoolmate whose dad owns school gets caught in her own lies and is expelled. Happy ending for the blonde girls as they get together in the end.

Now, will the original Elle Woods (aka. Reese Witherspoon) please come back for post-graduate studies?!

3778153,3,B001RP974W,"Legally Blondes was basically a rip-off of Legally Blonde except instead of Elle Woods, there were Annabelle (Annie) and Isabelle (Izzy) from across the pond. Many of the characters are like the ones in Legally Blonde: Sylvia is like Paulette, Chris is like Emmett, Mr. Golden is like the UPS Guy, Tiffany is like a Vivian (kind of), and Warner is like Justin. They also have a thing called the ""flip and wave"" (ehhm, bend and snap anyone?) that they teach Sylvia. The thing is basically all about how blondes shouldn't be underestimated & has a ""trial"" at the end. It was an okay movie, it would've been better if they hadn't copied off of the original.",1250640000,,654,4.598290598290598

 so if you want to watch a movie that is soooooo prodictable and has 2 dumb blonde twins who will turn out to be paris hiltons then watch this.",1249603200,2,507,4.260416666666667

3778156,1,B001RP974W,"I have no idea why Reese Witherspoon would associate her name to this film.  She is a top Hollywood actress and this movie is pure garbage. As the first two movies in the series are focused toward an older audience, this is driven straight toward tweens.  The production value is pretty much worthless even for a tween movie.  Pure and simple, this movie is a cruel joke with the butt of the joke being the intelligence of the viewer.  Tween or not, avoid this movie at all costs.  It is quite possible that this movie beats out Dark Harvest 2 as the worst movie of all time.

Why? Why? Why?",1243728000,6,591,4.327272727272727
3778157,4,B001RP974W,"Legally Blondes is a really good movie. Granted it's not as good as the original Legally Blonde movie but hey it's still really good.

This movie is about Elle Woods twin cousins (Annabelle and Isabelle Woods) who come to town from the UK. Their father just got a teaching job in California. Elle Woods does NOT make an appearance in the film BUT she is talked about a lot in the film. In fact the twins and their dad stay in Elle Woods house and there are a lot of paintings of Elle Woods and Bruiser displayed in the house. The girls go to the same Prep school as Elle so they are well known by the principal and not well liked by her and some of their classmates. One of the girls gets accused of cheating (I think it is Isabelle) so Annabelle and their friends have to present a case and evidence to prove that Isabelle is innocent. Watch the movie to see if the girls and their friends can save the day.

There are some similarities about the Legally Blonde movies and the Legally Blondes movie.  Elle, Annabelle, and Isabelle all love pink, they all have chihuahua's as pets (in fact Elle buys her cousins the dogs), and all three movies involve law type cases.

Legally Blondes is aimed towards kids and teens but I am a young adult and I found it to be a really good movie. It had a really good storyline and the acting was good as well.",1241481600,25,1345,4.262745098039216

3778176,1,B001RP974W,"I watched the previous two Legally Blonde movies and rather enjoyed them, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Unfortunately, it was so much less enjoyable than either of the previous two films that I turned it off less than a half hour into the film. The British twin characters were both unpleasant, unlikeable, and unrelatable. The character of Elle from the previous two films, while similarly rich and Valley Girl, was written and portrayed in a way that didn't scream ""I am a superficial Material Girl who is willing to scam, cheat, and lie to get what I want cause I'm blonde and boys think I'm pretty, like, duh"". There was no compelling or driving scene that made any sense. Honestly, if you liked the Legally Blonde films with Reese Witherspoon, give this one a hard pass. It's on a different level from those two films and quite frankly, that level is a much lower one.",1477008000,7,881,4.547169811320755

While the Untied Queendumb is a notorious enemy of the United States, sending everything but troops in support of the divisive Confederacy after numerous prior wars against US, more recently criminally expropriating the property of American citizens, engaging in chemical warfare against US via their ""Bahamas"" subsidiary,and via their royalist ""Republican"" cronies attempting to require donation of American property for their ""Canada"" subsidiary in the XL Pipeline swindle, neither the ""legally blondes"" girls nor their father were anywhere near the level on which those international war making acts have been perpetrated.  Meanwhile, their personal opponent daw turd of a family of the felony identity thieving, felony illegal seizure of the private property of American citizens, antisocial homosexist narcophony ""computer"" industry has and demonstrated in the film all of the royalist criminal propensities of the Untied Queendumb rather than anything in conformance with the Constitution of the United States of America.

Then there is how they claim to be in fashion heaven when all these shops are in Central London and even Westfields. Then there is their terrible ""English"" accents that I have never met anyone with one like theirs.

It is also bizzare that they complain at uniforms when about 98% of schools in England has uniforms... this film just again and again seems to just like ratting at a poor english sterotype which is all offensive...

3778362,2,B001RP974W,"Legally Blondes was a belated attempt to milk the Legally Blonde franchise for one last time. It was released in 2009 as a made for dvd film rather than for cinema release. Unfortunately no Reese Witherspoon in this one - the nearest she got to it was as Producer.

There are attempts to link this film to the previous two Legally Blondes in various ways. The twins, Izzy and Annie, who star are Elle Wood's cousins who share her liking for pink, cute dogs etc. As a piece of trivia, one of the chihuahua's in this film is Bruiser who was also in the original Legally Blonde film. The twins are English and move to California to live in Elle's house with their widowed father. They attend a private school and get involved in cheating allegations in a school test and seek to clear Izzy's name.

Quite a light weight offering, clearly directed more at younger viewers than the previous two Legally Blonde films were. It probably works for this audience but adults may well find it disappointing.

I think the story is far from original. If there are many people who want to see this, it must be because it's title and how it mentions Elle Woods (who didn't appear for the whole movie)! So unfair!
