Skip & Molly teach how to reuse things most people would throw away. They also do a real good job entertaining in an endearing and yet exciting way!

I would recommend this DVD to any parent who wants to start their kids being green at a young age!

Can't wait for more Skip, Molly, & Professor Dodo! When's the next DVD coming out?",1263254400,3,535,4.33
