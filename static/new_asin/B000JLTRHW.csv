2675510,5,B000JLTRHW,the series is another version of firefly. successful but not well known. the series has 22 hour episodes and has great effects and intriguing episode plots as well as some surprisingly good acting for a b-series. the series is based in the 21st century and follows a band of free-lance bounty hunters in a galaxy of deadly criminals. the series was canceled due to finances and came to dvd soon after. its also spawned the series Starhunter 2100. all in all its a great series for any sci-fi junkie.,1196640000,5,499,4.617977528089888
2675511,2,B000JLTRHW,"I really wanted to like Starhunter. The premise is interesting and the universe is original, but it just doesn't live up to it's potential. The budget was obviously lacking. Sets are generally small and uninspired, the CGI work is marginal, and the special effects distract from rather than enhance the story.

Worse than that is the lackluster acting. The intro snippets by the crew's bounty hunter agent are clever, but the only real cast members that draw you in are Percy and (with less consistency) Dante.

The real trouble with the show is that despite a fairly original premise and a bold real-space setting, it just comes out as a Firefly wanna-be. As if regular plot and aesthetic similarities weren't enough, the composition of the ensemble reflects Joss Whedon's masterpiece pound-for-pound (Mal=Dante, Kalee=Percy, Zoe=Luc). Unfortunately it is a poor substitute for more Serenity.

The only reason that I even made it past the second episode was an irresistible infatuation with Tanya Allen. Unless you're already caught on her endearing warmth and charm, just go watch Firefly again instead.",1193961600,7,1105,5.196629213483146
2675512,3,B000JLTRHW,"Decent story line, decent effects, ok characters.
Basically a solid series-not great, but ok.",1192579200,3,93,5.714285714285714
2675513,3,B000JLTRHW,"I found this series very good, but for it to say the complete series is incorrect Starhunter has 44 episodes over two seasons they are selling season one as the complete series with only 22 episodes to it's name that part I found to be a disapointment. All in as a sci-fi fan I loved it.",1191110400,4,287,4.142857142857143
2675514,3,B000JLTRHW,"This is the original series that spawned Starhunter 2300. The production values are nowhere close to Starhunter 2300 and the special effects are necessarily far short of the subsequent series. However, the stories are reasonably well scripted and the characters interesting. It's not up to the standards of ""Farscape"" but it does have its moments.

There is a huge discontinuity between Starhunter and Starhunter 2300 and there is little done to explain the breaks in the storyline. But it's still superior to most ""made for tv"" films that you say on *ahem* tv stations dedicated to sci-fi.

Don't expect too much, enjoy the quirky characters and you'll be ready for a better experience with Starhunter 2300.

The disks have zero ""extras"" and no interviews with the cast or production crew. Which is a shame because anyone buying this set is probably a fan and would've appreciated the extra effort. The studios are getting lazy.",1189036800,118,929,5.01948051948052
2675515,5,B000JLTRHW,One of the best Sci-Fi shows ever produced with non stop action and a few tongue in cheek zingers to keep you guessing.  Highly recommended for any Sci-Fi fan.,1183334400,6,159,4.482758620689655
2675516,3,B000JLTRHW,"Starhunter was someone's attempt to create a completely new scifi series, it failed, but it was a very good try. The stories tended to be a tad dry sometimes and the acting wasn't the best. Effects were cheap and the settings tended to all look the same.
But, if you used your imagination and focused on the story ideas, it was a very entertaining show. You have mankind spread out across the solar sytem, earth is in ruins and the various planets and moons have their own soveriegn goverments. The only real law capable of moving back and forth are freelance bounty hunters and our three heroes are a bounty hunting team, working for some guy who you see give a narration at the beginning of each episode.
The show tended to be more cerebral then the average scifi fan might like, but it was a good first try. If you're a die hrad fan who is always looking for the new and unusual, like I am, you'll enjoy it.",1182729600,7,910,4.358823529411764
2675517,3,B000JLTRHW,"But, I got it on the reviews and what I had read elsewhere. Turns out to be pretty good for a series. Some effort was put in to the visuals. The stories are a bit simplistic and the teen niece is almost too much to bear, but definitely worth the price and enjoyable on a Saturday afternoon.",1181520000,10,290,4.105263157894737
2675518,4,B000JLTRHW,"Okay, so I'm glad there's finally a Region 1 set of the entire first series of this interesting and underrated SF series.  Nice that it's on four disks instead of six individual disks in my Australian Region 4 PAL set of the same series.  The NTSC set also has a crisper image transfer than the Aussie set.  However, Echo Bridge Entertainment, would it have been too much trouble to actually place the episodes IN ORDER on the disks?  For those of you not initiated on Starhunter yet, ""The Divinity Cluster"" is the first episode in the series, although it's number 4 on the first disk.  View it first.

This tale of a former farmer looking for his kidnapped son while making his living as a bounty hunter has a touch of FIREFLY in the plot, acting on par with the original BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and a complete mess-up by the DVD ""expert"" recorders.  It comes with three DVD in the package.  They are not numbered or labeled.  When loaded you have a choice of playing 2-4 episodes at a time - no individual episodes can be picked.  Episodes are names but also not numbered and you will quickly find out that not only are they not in sequence on each disk, but in some cases are not on the right disk.  This could have been a much better purchase if only they had labeled the DVD 1-2-3 and put the episodes in order on the disks.

Sorry, I saw none of that.  The special effects were as cheap and hokey as a B-movie made in the sixties.  The acting? Well I can't say how much the actors were paid, but I'm convinced it was way too much.  The storylines were weak and unimaginative and they seemed to drag on FOREVER.  And on top of that, one episode had naked females in it.  Sure didn't see that coming. I watched the whole season because I did spend $5 on it.  This was released in 2000, but you would think it was 1960.  Star Trek: the original series was released in the late 60's and makes this look like a home made basement movie.

I really have no complaints about the special effects because, well, let's face it, there are other low budget flicks and TV series out there now that have CGI that is way worse.

She never does what she is told by the captain, who is also her uncle, even though they have a good relationship!!!  She causes life and death situations, then manages to help the two other crew to,get out of them, one of the two crew being the captain, and the other being the security officer!!!  They are bounty hunters!!!  The bail bondsman, their boss, comes on at the start of every episode, with some platitudes and information, but could be done without, because he's irritating, too!!!  However, he begins to grow on you, no,matter how much you resist!!!  Even the engineer starts to grow on you, but continues to,irritate by constant disobedience!!!

2675695,4,B000JLTRHW,"Okay, let's be honest here - the first several episodes of Starhunter SUCK.  Seriously.  Bad acting, bad script, really bad effects.  It was so disappointing, in fact, that I stop watching altogether and shelved it.  I complained to anyone who would listen, ""how in the heck did this show last an entire season?  For that matter, how did it even get greenlighted in the first place?!?""

Several weeks later, I had too much time on my hands, and I decided to give it one more shot, picking up where I left off.  An extremely surprising thing happened - it got better!  By the time the season ended, the actors had found their groove, the scripts were (mostly) markedly better, and the effects weren't continually screaming ""low budget!""  I was enjoying it, and was sorry to see the end of the season.  It certainly never rises to the level of Firefly, Farscape or B5, but it is an enjoyable escape.

Here's my advice:  pick it up (you can get it for a song on Amazon, used), don't attach too much judgement to the first several episodes, and enjoy it when it improves.

There's been talk of the parallels between Starhunter and Firefly.  Certainly there are similarities in characters and, less so, costuming.  Then again, there are typically stock character types in such shows - the spunky (boy-crazy) young female who's a genius in their own right (or boy - think ""Wesley Crusher""), the strong Amazon (Farscape, DS9, Firefly & Starhunter), the brooding-with-a-history strong male lead, etc., etc.  What matters is whether the actors and scripts get past the stereotypes, and evolve into flesh and blood characters you actually care about.  In this series, they do.  My guess is that Mr. Whedon was, in fact, influenced to a point.  But the parallels were more of a pleasant echo initially, that ultimately lost importance as the characters evolved.  And there's certainly no shortage of examples of one creation influencing to varying degrees those that followed.

A word of warning - for the second season, they reworked the series a bit and renamed it Starhunter 2300.  If you go online to acquire it, you will be shocked at the exorbitant cost!  I've no idea why that is the case, but suffice it to say that I won't be seeing the second season unless one falls into my lap....

Enjoy!",1413331200,2,2289,4.736708860759494

For those unfamiliar, the protagonists are bounty hunters in a non-FTL future, with a terraformed Mars, and plenty of humans across the Sol system; the captain is looking for his son, who was kidnapped in a raid. The title, however, is a misnomer - there is a relaunch from a couple years later that is the same setting, and has some continued characters, so it's not really the complete series, tho' it is a complete story arc, and the major mysteries are resolved. the low-budget makes the effects not always the best, but the director avoids any major blunders, so they don't detract.",1373414400,,850,4.673333333333333

2675790,4,B000JLTRHW,"I'm currently debating whether to shell out seventy bucks for season two of this series. And I probably will.

Flashback time... I rented the box set as a cheap show to watch, after finding it at a record store for about the price it is here on Amazon (currently 10 bucks). So I got it for no better reason than it seemed like campy scifi I could watch with my dad (who doesn't like scifi unless it's old 1950s monster film style). Well, this does have a fair bit of camp, each episode starts with this narration from a guy straight out of Hemmingway, ""I'm a bounty hunter, but it's just something that I do. I'm really looking for something that was stolen from me. Ten years ago, they took my son. As I search, there are signs that something is happening. That humanity is about to change. But I won't be distracted. How do you find one small boy In such a large universe? I'm not sure. But I have to keep trying.""

Yea. It's a bit goofy, and the first episode I got of this show was completely out of order (I checked wikipedia), making it sort of confusing at first. Not to mention, I watched it at night when I was about to fall asleep, so I missed some of the action. And then suddenly, the show just sorta clicked, and I couldn't stop watching it. Why? The characters.

The basic premise of two bounty hunters, an engineer, and a holographic computer system on a mission of rescue (with at least one having a secret agenda), with episodic characters, lent itself for pretty heavy flushing out of each character. The captain is haunted by the kidnapping of his son, and the loss of his late wife (neither of which turn out to be what he expected them to be, by the finale of the first season). The backup hunter, is actually driven by a conspiracy called the Divinity Cluster (something to do with humans having godlike extra alien DNA as their last few genomes, so yea supernatural powers), and is working for an organization. Tanya Allen steals the show as the engineer niece of the captain, with her quirky personality that gets steadily more isolated, paranoid, and slightly sociopathic (but in a funny way) as the show goes on. And finally we have a snooty British holograph that controls the ship's systems, and provides exposition and a bit of comic relief.

This show is NOT for everyone (as noted from some of the sour reviews), but the way the characters play off each other (especially Travis, in later episodes) makes it a hidden gem.",1368316800,2,2452,4.4787472035794185
2675868,4,B000JLTRHW,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I never saw this show on TV and I have not seen other releases of this material on DVD/VHS.

I've tried to avoid spoilers in the following...

The original Starhunter is, I believe, far better than the reboot (Starhunter 2300).  The two main actors do a fantastic job of portraying their characters...but the captain disappears in the reboot and is ""replaced"" (i.e. another actor steps in, not to play that character but to portray a totally new character) by a shallow actor who thinks that merely striking a pose is acting.  And the star (teenage girl) is totally believable and quirky and is the main reason to watch season one...but in the reboot her character is depressed all the time (understandable, given how season one ends, but still, after a couple episodes it's a bit much--and it lasts for pretty much the whole season).

Also, the mysterious threat to everyone that is the recurring thread (in much the same way that the UFO coverup is the thread connecting many, but not all, X Files episodes) is one thing that makes season one a cut above.  That thread is almost entirely missing from the reboot and handled poorly.

As far as the DVD itself, the image is extremely grainy--far more grainy than other DVDs I have of TV shows from that time period (so I know it's not the fault of my system).  Once you get into the series, though, this takes a back seat to the very good stories.",1366934400,2,1431,4.584313725490196

Pros
Nice CGI graphics (somebody knows their stuff)
The ships and space look awesome on a high-def LCD TV
Acting is quite good for the most part
Dialog is pretty good
All of the main actors/characters are reasonably well done
Occasional, brief, inexplicable toplessness

Cons
Overall stories are not well put together
Some episodes drag on way too long with almost nothing happening
If you're dying for the redhead to wear anything skimpy, you'll never see it.
There are too few characters to make up a really good dynamic
Occasional, brief, inexplicable toplessness

There are many episodes where there is a big setup, then certain characters just off themselves for no apparent reason.  The overall arc for the whole season is mostly confusing and seems to lose certain aims only to get them back a couple episodes later.

The series is watchable and it's not painful to watch, but I didn't find it very fulfilling or satisfying.  There seems like a lot of promise and it's not some bottom of the bucket no budget show, so it's in that band of not being so bad it's funny but not being really good either.

It was really bad and as I sad gave me a head ache. If I did not look away it might have been worse then a head ache. I am glad those transmissions changed about half way through the series.

I bought this for three bucks at Half Price Books, thinking, oh, cool, a sci fi tv series that I haven't seen, and, look, it takes place in our solar system. Micahel Pare's a nice actor (loved him in Eddie and the Cruisers) and there are two cute chicks in here ta boot! The cover art looked interesting but I learned from novels not to judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately, this series lives up to that slogan. Slow, tedious and dumb. I grew bored with the not-too-subtle sexual overtures of the ""smart"" girl mechanic shennigans; let's see, breakout the prisoner (or irrationally sympathize), seduce him, punch him and save the ship. Psycho chick studied after that damn Wesley Crusher from Star Trek the Next Generation. The CGI is limited, yeah, but I can overlook that, what with me being a B-movie fan and all, but the takes are too long so you get all kinds of time to gander at poor visual effects. The show's opening credits sucked thirteen flavors of Rancor rear and the music put me to sleep, twice in fact. Pare phoned his scenes in from somewhere around Jupiter, I think. Oh, and that annoying boss of Pare's, the Australian?-wannabe-Italian mafioso and his idiotic bad signal, was infuriatingly mundane and made me wish that someone from the Soprano's (or Mad Max) would show up and cap his poor display of an appearance. Canadian TV ruined Hitchhiker, Ray Bradbury Theater and Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and turned the second season of War of the Worlds into sludge so I shouldn't be too surprised; their sense of wonder and awe seem to be asleep and their plotting is far too leisurely and does not invoke deep intellect (which I'm sure some beatnik pot smoker would argue) but rather an indication of apathy.

I wanted to love this, wanted to believe it could overcome its drag against against solar winds, but I've been disappointed in love before...lol.

2675905,2,B000JLTRHW,"This review is for the Alliance Atlantis/Echo Bridge version.

The series just isn't that great.  Each of these unedited episodes begins with a pointless monologue by the loathsome, cynical Rudolpho, who funds the journeys of the Tulip, so named because these are the letters of its full name which haven't worn off yet.  The crew consists of Dante Montana, bounty hunter, who's just doing this for cash while trying to find his son; Lucretia (Luc), their ""security expert""; and Dante's teenage niece Percy, the ship's engineer (before Kaylee made girl engineers cool.)  Add in a holographic AI Caravaggio for...additonal comic relief, I guess.

World building, plots, dialogue are all sub-par.  The one redeeming feature of the series is Percy.  If you like the show at all, it will probably be because of her.  The idea of an immature female character may not appeal to everyone, but she's very entertaining to watch.  Certainly, in comparison to the rest of the cast.

Many of the episodes are complete in themselves (and thus can be seen in almost any order) but some of the episodes involve ""The Divinty Cluster,"" which forms the actual main subplot to the series (the other subplot being Dante's search for his son Travis.)  The Divinity Cluster subplot doesn't really reach a satisfying conclusion in this series.  The series ends in a cliffhanger, leading in to Starhunter 2300 (which I own but haven't watched yet.)

There are no extras apart from a few previews.  Ratings-wise, there are a few minor swear words and some almost-kinda-sorta nudity for brief moments in one episode, and some brief topless nudity in another episode.  PG-13ish.

2675931,1,B000JLTRHW,"This series had potential.  I think they made a really bad choice as to the PILOT plot --- the main male lead, becomes overcome by the mental powers of the female baddie (who has a very UNHEALTHY relationship with  her son - GROSS) .... and this leaves the captain rolling around on the floor in a drooling stupor.  NOT the best way to endear us to the main character.  So, the first impression of the series is --- half-gross - half-yawnnnnnnn.

Visually, it comes across as being very poor videotape.

Overall, I would say to not buy this series --- unless you absolutely have to have it for your collection.

Percy is a hoot and Dante, as played by Michael Pare is excellent. Luc is cool, and very funny in a subtle way. In fact, most of the 'cool' about this series is the subtle humor. No laugh tracks, no super dramatic music. It relies more on a good story line and good acting. Think of it as a much drier version of Firefly. Actually this first season predates Firefly. Not saying that if you like Firefly you'll like this series though.

It took this series a few episodes to hit it's stride.  In fact, the ""Tulip"" in the early episodes looked to me like a 3D model without the texture done on the outside.  It really looked cheesy.  But after a while, the actors started to act (except Tanya Allen who was great from the start) and we get more and more involved in the very imaginative world of 2275 when mankind has colonized the solar system, but hasn't got the interstellar stuff down yet, so we're not contacting a new alien every week, just a variety of all-to-human characters.

But this should be not the subject to this review. I want to take a closer Look on it's technical quality. I saw this show first in Germany where the station hid it in it's early morning time slots. Despite this obstacle I managed to watch/record it and so I can tell you that the proper aspect ratio of this is in 16:9 (1,78:1). When I got the DVDs from the States I was crushed to see that they cropped the image to achieve a 4:3 AR (why that they did this is beyond me since we life in the 21st Century where most TV sets are 16:9 displays). By doing this, many of the filmed information is missing now. But that wasn't the only disappointment. The contrast of the image, when compared to my off the air recordings, is very poor. Furthermore, I know that the sound of my recordings are all in Dolby Surround, but some of the Episodes on the DVDs are only Mono-Sound. They're surely all produced in Mutichannel, why they give us only monoaural sound on this DVDs escapes me.

Well, to make it short: The series is now also available in Germany, released by a label called epiX. And it is in it's proper aspect ratio and even anamorphic coded! The contrast is also much better now. However, the englisch language track suffers from the same as the US version did, meaning: some Episodes are only monaural. The german versions are all full surround-sound. I'm not quite sure if the german release is region free, but if you have the possibilitiy to play R2-Discs and if you, like me, love this show, you should take a pick on this release. You, most surely, won't regret it!",1272931200,5,1769,4.443076923076923
2675985,5,B000JLTRHW,"Torchwood is the only other SciFi series I can truly compare Starhunter with.  I know it bears a much greater superficial resemblance to Firefly, in that it involves a commercial spaceship moving from one dangerous encounter to another.  But that's where the similarity with Firefly ends and the similarity with Torchwood begins.  Where Firefly, for all the danger and violence the crew encounters, is essentially an upbeat show presenting the triumph of good over evil, Starhunter - like Torchwood - presents a rather bleak picture of the real world, in which the good guys may triumph, but at a cost almost greater than whatever victory they attain.  And, as with Torchwood, it makes for a riveting experience watching the stories unfold with unexpected twists and turns that render the inevitable defeat of the bad guys as almost anti-climactic.  In only one of the stories, in fact - Cell Game - was the ending satisfying in the usual SciFi sort of way.
The three main characters are among the most unique SciFi characters the genre has to offer.  The first two episodes I despised Percy (the Tanya Allen character) as a meddling brat; but, as the season unfolded, she actually became the most sensible and most useful in getting the crew through whatever they encountered.  Both Dante (Michael Pare) and Luc (Claudette Roche) have overriding obsessions that render them almost useless at times; and they think nothing of risking everything on any chance, however slim, to gratify those obsessions.
The stories are great, with excellent writing, extremely bizarre villains and, in my opinion, very effective special effects - but then, I'm not a special effects freak who finds neat computer gimmicks the be-all and end-all.  But the show's not for people who need happy endings to make watching a worthwhile experience.  The stories are dark and foreboding, giving a picture of the kind of world one would definitely not wish to live in.",1270166400,12,1942,5.0062111801242235

2676007,4,B000JLTRHW,"Starhunter is a bad show in many senses of the word. Much of the acting is abysmal. The production values were considered low when it came out, and that was going on 10 years ago. It's got this weird lighting issue throughout most of the series where the characters are little more than black shapes wandering about their ship. And, as most of my fellow reviewers were quick to point out, most of the things Starhunter set out to do were done far better by Firefly a few years later.

Not exactly a glowing endorsement there. So why watch it then?

Well, it takes a certain type of person to enjoy Starhunter, and I am proud to admit to being one of them. If you're thinking about buying this series, do yourself a favor and go in expecting the corniest sci-fi has to offer. It's for the same type of guilty pleasure that you would watch one of those Sci-Fi channel original movies. (Okay, maybe not that bad, but don't expect to be taking it too seriously) That said, in my humble opinion, Starhunter provides just as many moments of emotional engagement and genuine interest as it does campy laughs. The main story arc, involving main character Dante's search for his son and, to a lesser extent, a mysterious alien gene in human DNA, is intriguing enough, and isn't shoved in your face all the time. The small cast of three main characters allows for quite a bit of character development among them, and seeing how the show favors drama over action for the most part, you feel that you really know them by the end. I found it especially interesting to see the tension and trust issues caused by the two-faced Luc develop. The show builds to a pretty exciting climax, and I think season one works on its own as a standalone story. You can tell that the producers put a lot of heart into the show, even though it doesn't always translate well. Episodes were hit-and-miss for me, but taken as a whole, I quite enjoyed Starhunter. I would definitely recommend watching an episode or two before deciding to buy the series, but if you're the type of person who enjoys cheesy sci-fi and are willing to forgive Starhunter's more egregious faults, I think you'll find it to be a worthwhile experience.",1261008000,12,2195,4.554430379746836
2676008,4,B000JLTRHW,"I often mourn the loss of series that are canceled after their first season, but I am gratified that studios have taken to releasing these ""diamonds in the rough"" on ""The complete series"" DVD sets. Many of these series I never heard of or never had the chance to watch. I had never heard of Starhunter nor of the sequel series, Starhunter 2300 either. However, based on some reviews here I decided to give them a shot. I will agree with several reviewers who have panned the production quality, because this is most emphatically NOT a Star Trek or even Firefly quality series. That said, about a disc into the series I found myself looking forward to the next episode. Not so much because it was a compelling storyline or for the amazing special effects. (Nearly 300 years in the future and they're still using weapons that fire projectiles from cartridges.) I was, however, becoming attached to the characters, in spite of some sketchy writing and the less-than-academy-award performances of Michael Par, and the campy ""Incoming transmission"" intro to each episode. I actually found myself looking forward to Rudolpho's latest gems of wisdom, Carravagio's wisecracks and of course, the cute and perky Percy. So, if you're looking for another Star Trek series, keep looking. If you're looking for a pretty good story line, some low-budget but not insulting special effects, a good ensemble cast and 1056 minutes of escape, then check this series out.

2676013,1,B000JLTRHW,"Starhunter is without question one of the worst things ever committed to film. I gave it one star only because Amazon won't let me give it no stars.
From the cheesy introduction to each episode by the annoying ""bounty hunter boss"" to the nonsensical jumpy editing and the incomprehensible scripts, I can't imagine how this thing stayed on the air for an entire season.
The first episode of the series has our heroes, two bounty hunters and the teen-aged niece of the ship's captain, transporting a psychotic psychiatrist and her intelligent, but dweeby son to trial for multiple murders on a prison colony.
For reasons that are never explained, they leave the two of them, who are involved in an incestuous affair, in openwork cages right next to each other and leave the woman in possession of a high tech bracelet that she uses to take over the mind of the captain.
During the episode, the niece, who also serves as the engineer and mechanic aboard ship, lets the murderer's son out of his cage, because she thinks he's cute, and precipitates problems based entirely on plot driven stupidity.
If this particular plot had been done say in the middle of the series, after we had gotten to know the characters and started to care about them, it could have been workable, but as the first episode in a series, in which we do not know these people or any of their motivations, it was a complete disaster.
The following episodes, and I will admit here that I was not able to actually finish watching most of them, do not get any better.
In one episode, for example, the writers introduce a ship full of people in the first two minutes and then kill them all off a minute later.
We never actually understand the motivation of the any of the characters and all of their actions seem to be driven by the needs of the plot in that episode rather than any deeply held beliefs.
The ship that they are on, which is apparently an old cruise liner, has space for hundreds of people, but now has only the three inhabitants. This makes no sense from the position of operating a business as the cost of running a ship of that size would be vastly more than one could bring in by picking up and transporting the occasional criminal.
In one episode, we find that there are three military officers who have been in cold storage for the last 50 years on one of the lower decks of the Tulip (yes that is the name of the bounty hunter's ship) who for some reason have never been detected by the three crew members, who have been aboard this ship for years. It is never made clear whether the crew  have never been to that deck, or if they simply never noticed the power drain into that abandoned section of the spacecraft.
In another episode, prisoners escape (again) into the ship and the crew have to chase them around this huge vessel that they apparently have not explored.
Ok, so the world creation on the show is bad, the characters make no sense and the technology is absurd, the worst part, however, is the production of the show itself.
The scripts for Starhunter are inane at best and incomprehensible at worst, the acting is mostly sub par, particularly the work of Michael Pare as the captain (who sleepwalks his way through the series), the directing is incompetent and the film editors must have been kidnapped and replaced by monkeys.
This show is so bad that if someone offers it to you for free you should consider them to be your enemy. If you are offered the choice between watching this series and shooting yourself in the head, take the bullet!",1216080000,31,3543,4.5359375

2676015,4,B000JLTRHW,"I gave this show 4 star because even though this was a great show it had it flaws.  I have only watched episodes 1 through 12 but so far am enjoying the show.  Now I can see where the comparison for Firefly does come in, but don't be fooled the two shows have very little in common.  I am a huge fan of Firefly, and this show stands alone.

The Bad: The graphics and special effects at times is not the best and the acting at some points (in a couple episodes) is bad. The show just began as if you knew the whole history; there was no real build up.  The US order of the episodes is not the correct one; which is slightly annoying.

The Good: The thing I loved about this show was the emotions of the characters. If it was the pain Dante felt because of his son, or the fear he felt for Percy. Or even Percy's frustrations for how protective Dante was towards her; plus the relationship between them was great. This was a great addition to this show. As was Luc she really stood out as a mother figure and friend for Percy. One thing I really enjoyed was the beginning of the episode, with Rudolpho DeLuna.  His transmission always goes with the episode; he and Caravaggio add a bit of humor to the show.

But it would have been nice to see how Dante got into Bounty Hunting, him taking in Percy, meeting Luc, and so on.  As I said I am only half way through the `first' season of Starhunter and am pleased. Each episode seems to get better as the characters develop and the storyline(s) get more intense. I do recommend this show for any sci-fi fan.",1214179200,5,1551,4.1952861952861955
2676016,5,B000JLTRHW,"I've always been a HUGE fan of the Starhunter series, and this complete box set (finally!) is really a treat to behold. Don't be fooled by the ""complete series"", though...they did retool the show for the second season under the new name of Starhunter 2300. This is a very bare-bones set-simple menus, and no extras. It does, however, have the extra footage that was cut from the original U.S. showings.

The show itself follows the bounty-hunting crew of Dante Montana (Michael Par), his niece Percy Montana (Tanya Allen), and Lucretia Scott (Claudette Roche). Despite being plagued with some VERY cheap effects, and less than stellar writing, the show still manages to engage and captivate. Some of Percy's one liners alone warrant a purchase. Besides, you can't really beat the price.",1209859200,33,786,5.046153846153846
2676027,4,B000JLTRHW,"The Good Things
*Some nifty special effects (even if they are low-grade) and a little bit of action.
*Pretty good characters.  You get to know them well by the end of the show.
*Pretty good stories.  Interesting story arc throughout the show.
*Each episode starts with a monologue by one of the characters, which is neat.

The Bad Things
*Low production value; fake-looking sets and lower-grade special effects.
*Basis is more on drama and less on action.  It gets a little slow.
*Don't really like the music.

For the price, I am generally pleased with the show.  It has a good cast of characters and some interesting stories.  Special effects aren't great, but are used effectively.  Even though it gets a little slow, it's worthwhile to sci-fi fans (especially if you liked ""Firefly"").",1205884800,6,788,4.87218045112782

2676029,4,B000JLTRHW,"At first it is striking all the similarities between Firefly and Starhunter. But before you go thinking about this as a Firefly wannabe, keep this in mind - STARHUNTER CAME FIRST!

I know. It surprised me too. This feels almost like Firefly fan fiction to me.

Anyway, despite the similarities, I would not compare this show to Firefly. When it comes to scifi, Firefly is in an exclusive league. It is unfair to compare Starhunter to a show like it. Firefly had a budget of over $2 million per episode. I doubt Starhunter had a tenth of that.

Now Babylon 5, there's something you can compare this to. Good stories, bad scripting, bad acting, cheap sets.

The fx rate poor to fair in SH whereas they are fair to good in B5.

So with all that how can I give this show 4 stars? It's a matter of expectations. I caught a few episodes a few years ago when my Tivo grabbed them for me off of late night syndication. I had never heard of Starhunter. I had NO expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Although the acting overall is subpar, the three main actors are all solid performers. Tanya Allen, who plays Percy (SH's Kaylee for all you Firefly fans), is ADORABLE. The guest stars range from very good to the worst you've ever seen. (Seriously, I'd love to hear somebody argue with that after watching the first episode - you'll know who I'm talking about.)

The stories are good, but the plotting and the characterization are often frustratingly lazy.

These DVDs are only $20! Understand what you are getting and control your expectations and there is no way you will think it wasn't worth it.",1200355200,31,1595,4.533101045296167
2676030,4,B000JLTRHW,"I don't mean the show sucks; it doesn't. Starhunter is a really great sci-fi show; one of the best around. What sucks is that  they had already put out two sets of shows,leaving only a handful left to put onto DVD. But instead of a volume three with the remaining last six or so shows, they now have the complete set. Cool, if you had never spent all that money buying the first two sets, but if  you did, your money is now pretty much wasted as is the space in your video collection where you can now have three items instead of the one.

Why couldn't they just complete the set with a less expensive third volume so we don't end up feeling like our money has been wasted, eh?

There really is nothing that I can say thats good about this show, its just terrible.  Save yourself some money and don't buy this rubbish.  If you want some good underground si-fi the try Firefly or Invasion, something along those lines, or any series thats been produced using something more than the power of a chicken brain cell!

2676034,4,B000JLTRHW,"This is a pretty good Sci-Fi series that gets better as you go. I was a bit unsure at first, but I was really involved by the end and hated to see it end. The characters developed very well and the story line was pretty good.

Definitely a low budget affair and some of the writing a bit amateurish, but the cast and crew really seemed to give it a go and won me over. The whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.

If you like Sci-fi along the lines of Firefly, you should enjoy this. In fact, I found many things here that seemed to have been payed homage in the Firefly series itself. I won't spoil your fun, but they're pretty clear. Firefly had much better scripts, but this series has heart. Money well spent and good enough that I will enjoy watching many times over.

2011-12-07 The current price has dropped below $9 which makes this a steal and a great value.  I still find myself intrigued by this series and coming back to it from time to time.  There's a touch of ""magic"" in this production, clearly a lot of the people involved put their heart into what they were doing.",1198800000,24,1091,4.225961538461538

Sadly the episodes did not! I've just seen 7 episodes of it, don't think I will watch the rest of it. The acting is bad, stories are bad and the special effects aren't great either.

Even Michael Pare's acting is a disappointment just as the rest of the cast with the exeption maybe of Murray Melvin.

All and all a disappointment, I know, it is a risk to buy a series which you did not see yet and this time it was a bad choice.",1197590400,13,681,4.143939393939394
8151736,5,B000JLTRHW,"This series has many aspects that seemed to have inspired the later series Firefly - A number of reviewers have it backwards - StarHunter aired FIRST...  StarHunter aired two years BEFORE firefly, 2000-2001, while Firefly Aired beginning in 2002.  This series has a ""broken down ship""  with a perky young female mechanic, and African American female warrior type as second in command, and they take on odd passengers.  It had an episode with a teenage girl with supernatural powers, an African American guy with a quirky personality who gets on the ship and threatens the female mechanic and crew...  The captain is tortured with electrodes in one episode...  Sound familiar? - basically a number of plot items that are later seen in Firefly.  This is NOT the quality program that firefly is, but it is a solid sci-fi show, that really seemed to inspire many parts of the Firefly series, which aired AFTER StarHunter.  I recommend it for its originality and concept, If you have seen Firefly, you'll see how StarHunter may have been source material for that series.",1519344000,,1065,4.910614525139665

8151738,4,B000JLTRHW,"Starhunter is an enjoyable series. It's pretty low budget, but I find that is part of this show's charm, not unlike with the old Dr. Who.

It came on cable about the same time as Firefly and shared a number of common themes like the second hand spacecraft. Instead of being smugglers Dante and Percy are bounty hunters with plenty of enemies. They get drawn into a search for the ""divinity cluster"" and that makes the overall arc of the series. Unfortunately the series was cancelled after the season 2 cliffhanger. Ouch.

The pace of this series is slow and it drags a bit at time and sometimes to the point of being rather plodding. Even with it's flaws (which both add and detract at times) Starhunter kept me entertained through the whole series. The first season is definitely the strongest and lack of closure a sore spot. For doing as much as they could with what appears to have been a tiny budget I'm giving them 4 stars, partly for effort.

I understand there is a mini-series reboot in the works for 2018 or 2019. Maybe there will be some closure to the series after all!",1508112000,,1082,4.482233502538071

This is not a special effects series, and thankfully it is not, because it actually has interesting stories and characters. No this is not Shakespeare nor Emmy awards, but it is a good, solid series with some brilliant creations. Once you become used to what it is, you will look be hooked.

But it didn't make my list of one season wonder sci-fi shows like Firefly, The Prisoner, UFO, Brisco County, Jr., Odyssey 5, Eerie, Indiana, Jericho, etc. Although I liked the female mechanic character on Firefly better than the female mechanic character on Starhunter, the latter beat Firefly to the punch by having a female mechanic on a ship by a couple of years.

Starhunter 2300 has been lumped together with Starhunter, but they were two different series, with different casts, not counting a couple of characters who managed to be in both shows. I haven't seen Starhunter 2300 or the movie Star Hunter. The first show wasn't good enough to spark my interest in other Starhunter installments.
