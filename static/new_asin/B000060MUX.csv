1684049,5,B000060MUX,"Anyone with an interest in Churchill MUST VIEW this series.  It is history at it's best.  I viewed this series and taped in on VHS and treated myself over the years by rewatching it.  In fact, based on this series I named my son after Churchill, with Winston as his middle name.
In short I can't say enough about the quality of this series. It will hold your attention for every minute, educate you on the main events and political drama affecting England in the 30's, and more importantly, give you the insight into how the politcal elite can lead themselves to craven acts of national destruction AND, how one man standing on principal can still save a nation from itself.  The lessons here are timeless.
I would also echo the sentiments of the other reviewer who noted that this is far superior to ""A Gathering Storm"" which, though a good effort,is cartoonish in its characterization of Churchill, compared to Robert Hardy's performance.  Hardy deserves the equivalant of the oscar for ""Best Televison Performance of the 20th Century"".
Get it, then watch it at least once a year. Each time, you'll come away with new insights, and new respect for what Churchill accomplished, and sacrificed, to save England from those willing to choose shame over war, only to get both.

1684050,5,B000060MUX,"These wonderful miniseries are every Churchillian's Nirvana, and one inevitably compares them with HBO's acclaimed movie ""The Gathering Storm"" since they both dwell on the same topic. However there's no match between the two, and this Masterpiece Theater production clearly wins the day.
No offense to Albert Finney -Emmy Award and all- but he doesn't hold a candle to Robert Hardy's Churchill, a tough act to follow if ever there was one. The same can be said for Sian Phillips (""I, Claudius"") as Clemmie, Eric Porter as Chamberlain and, for that matter, everyone else in the cast.
The movie covers the ten lonely, frustrating years of Churchill's political comeback. Sacked for his Gallipoli blunder, failed as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was long considered an embarrassing has-been. Epicurean, pigheaded, politically incorrect at the time, histrionic -even pedantic- he alone, nevertheless, had the guts to cry wolf against the rising Nazi menace and call for rearmament, only to be ignored by hesitant MPs and tremulous PMs. On top of it he suffered bouts of jealousy and depression, family and financial problems and even an automobile accident in New York City. Yet, all through his ordeals he still managed to paint, write, lecture, garden, ride, hunt, build a brickwall by himself, and deliver the finest speeches of the XXth Century!
 ""Never stop, never weary and never give in!""
...and never give it another thought: don't miss this!
P.S.: Although he never met Churchill personally, Hitler makes a sinister cameo early in the series. He is played by Gnther Meisner, a German actor who should enter the Guinness Book of Records as the longest running Hitler bit in history. Honest to God, I've never seen this guy in a role other than Hitler (""Winds of War"", ""Ace of Aces"") -or a Nazi (""Is Paris Burning?"", ""Boys from Brazil"", ""Under the Volcano"", etc.)!

1684051,5,B000060MUX,"Robert Hardy is wonderful in the role of Winston Churchill. This rendition of Churchill's perceptive battle in the 30's to combat Hitler and awaken Britain from it's torpor is infinitely better than the recent HBO film ""The Gathering Storm"". The supporting cast is superb, particularly Peter Barkworth as Baldwin, Edward Woodward as the slippery Sam Hoare, Eric Portman as Chamberlain and Sian Phillips as Clemmy. It covers all of the major political controversies that Churchill was involved with, India, the abdication in addition to the battle over re-armament. A MUST buy.",1021939200,12,576,5.34065934065934

1684073,1,B000060MUX,"I was looking forward to viewing this series. I was shocked to see the poor quality of this DVD.

It looked like an old fashion video that had been played 1000 times. It was very blurry.

Wow! I can't believe they would offer this kind of picture quality on a DVD. In this day of HD imaging this was a real let down. I was also disappointed that this DVD had no english subtitles.
Sometimes you don't want the volume up so loud and it would have helped to have subtitles.

The picture quality is so bad I could not continue to watch it after the first half hour of viewing. The acting is superb but the picture image quality is certainly not what I would have expected from a DVD. This was a rip off. If they are going to offer this kind of poor picture transfer quality to DVD they should at least have a warning.",1302912000,8,814,4.139240506329114
1684074,5,B000060MUX,"Purchased this for a friend that enjoys the work of Robert Harding. (Seigfrid Farnon - All Creatures Great & Small)
This is Robert Harding at his best and is worth owning to watch again & again. He was made for this role of Winston Churchill! The friend loved it and had been planning to order.",1300579200,2,294,4.363636363636363
1684075,3,B000060MUX,"I am a very big fan of the historical drama series that the BBC produced in the 1970's and 80's, including ""Fall of Eagles"", ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"", ""Elizabeth R"", ""The Last Place On Earth"", ""Mountbatten"" and others. Churchill, of course, is one of the most interesting political-military leaders of all time.  Then, when I came upon this series, and seeing that it was directed by Ferdinand Fairfax, who also directed ""The Last Place on Earth"" which is one of the finest historical-adventure productions of all time, in addition to starring Robert Hardy, who starred in ""Elizabeth R"" as Elizabeth's boyfriend Robert Dudley-The Earl of Leiceester, I had VERY high hopes for what I was going to see.
The reality proved to be very disappointing.  The series is largely flat and uninteresting, with long sequences which are outright bores. I will list some examples of what I find to be flaws in the series:
(1) Sian Phillips was one of the stars of I, Claudius playing the malevolent Livia, earning eternal fame for that role. Here, playing Clementine Churchill, she really doesn't have much to do. Frankly, Churchill's personal life and his problematic relationship with his children and his odd relationship with his wife are just not very interesting and are  irrelevant to the story of Churchill the politician and leader. One relatively interesting aspect which is not explored in enough detail is the strange relationship between Churchill and his young disicple in Parliament, Brendan Bracken who Churchill alternately loves and then rejects (Bracken at one point was leading people to believe that he was the ""bastard son"" of Churchill), but we aren't really shown the reasons for Churchill wide swings in mood towards him. We also see similar inconsistencies in his attitude towards his son Randolph who is forced to live in the shadow of his great father.
(2) Martin Gilbert, who wrote the official biography of Churchill, was historical advisor for the series and his being a worshipper of Churchill distorts the portrayal of him.  A good example was the proposal to give India autonomous self-government within the British Empire in the 1930's. Churchill was an inveterate opponent of proposals to give autonomy or outright independence to India.  Even the greatest admirers of Churchill admit that he was on the wrong side of history on this issue. Yet, the viewer of this series is subjected to a very long, boring, segment dealing with Parliament's conduct of hearings regarding the proposals on India.  Churchill discovers that certain industrialists who testified in front of a Parliamentary committee preparing the Bill coordinated their testimony with high-ranking members of the government who were pushing the bill. Churchill believes he has uncovered a major scandal, but nothing comes of it in the end.  That whole segment should never have been included.
(3) There is a bizarre scene where Churchill is visiting Munich at the end of  1932, just before Hitler comes to power.  Churchill is dining with ""Putzi"" Hanfstangel who was a close associate with Hitler and it is proposed that Churchill meet with Hitler. We then see Hitler with a sour look on his face, stalking around the dining room, glaring at Churchill, but the meeting never takes place. The whole scene of course is supposed to show the close encounter between the two antagonist-titans of the upcoming war, but in reality, Hitler would not have really cared much about Churchill at the time because he was a backbench MP whose ""future was behind him"". The frowning, scowling Hitler we see in this scene was also a caricature because he knew how to charm people (unfortunately) which is what helped him come to power and he certainly would have turned on the charm had he had the opportunity to meet him at this stage.
(4)  Samuel Hoare, a close associate of British Conservative leader and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin is portrayed as an ogre in the series, as Churchill's greatest nemesis within the political establishment. However, at the end of the series, when Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain is dithering about whether to declare war on Germany as a result of its invastion of Poland in 1939, we suddenly see Hoare as the main force pushing Chamberlain to end his policy of appeasement once and for all and to show backbone for once. It would have been interesting to see how Hoare made this turnabout, but we are told nothing about it.  In another historical drama made in the late 1980's about the beginnings of World War II we are shown that John Simon, Chamberlain's Chancellor of the Exchequer was the main force in the Cabinet forcing Chamberlain's hand. I don't know where the truth lies.

(5) Churchill was at his best and most entertaining when he was speaking in Parliament. We do see his famous ""the Boneless Wonder"" speech made attacking Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, but I think it would have been better to show more scenes like that one.  Churchill's secret of success was that he was able to make the most pointed criticism of political rivals yet he always worked hard to maintain the most cordial relations with even his most severe critics. It was this quality that enabled his opponents to agree to having him appointed Prime Minister at the time of the greatest crisis in 1940. We do see some of this in the series, but I think it would have been instructive to show more of how we worked in the interpersonal realm of politics.

All-in-all, this series just did not live up to the promise the idea behind it had.",1233792000,4,5537,4.908021390374332
1684076,5,B000060MUX,This is a DVD version of an older PBS biography.  I wore out my VHS version years ago.  If you love Churchill you will enjoy this professional biography of him.,1222992000,2,160,4.3

1684078,4,B000060MUX,"This series held my interest from beginning to end. How could it miss with such a monumental protagonist and absorbing subject matter. I especially liked Nigel Havers as Randolph, and the actors who played Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay McDonald, and Clement Atlee. I am afraid that I am less enthusiastic about Sian Phillips, who always plays Sian Phillips, and who, in my estimation, managed to make Clemmie rather unpleasant (as unpleasant as Phillips, appropriately, made Livia Augusta in ""I Claudius.""). As for Robert Hardy, he does an on-target impression of Sir Winston Churchill, but I think that he was misdirected.

Did Sir Winston really orate twenty-four-seven? Surely he spoke in a more modulated voice with the family around the dining room table [when he wasn't shouting at Randolph] or in the privacy of his bedroom! In this production, he addresses his ""dear Clemmie"" in his ""fight-them-on-the-beaches"" persona, to such an extent that Hardy's portrayal sometimes slips into parody. But again, I believe that the fault must be laid at the door of the director.

This quibble aside, the production is excellent. The recreation of the scenes in the House of Commons is fascinating. When Churchill is at the dispatch boxes letting Labour have it, Hardy is magnificent. This series is highly recommended for anyone interested in British political history.",1201564800,6,1360,5.23394495412844
1684079,5,B000060MUX,"I bought this DVD because I have always admired this great man, Sir Winston Churchill. Having read several books about him and having been enamored by his famous one-liners, both inside and outside of parliament, I wanted to get a ""feel"" for the person. Let me tell you that this DVD did precisely that. The fact that the focus is on the decade of 1929-1939 when Churchill was believed to be politically inconsequential makes this very interesting becaue it builds up the case for the ""delicious"" outcome that history has already shown us. It is not easy to portray a leader such as Churchill whose persona is well-established/remembered even many years after his death. While it is possible to copy trademarks such as the rotund body shape and cigar, it is far more difficult to build the personality, charisma and forcefulness that he had within a character role. This has been done brilliantly by Robert Hardy.",1194998400,3,913,4.858974358974359
1684080,4,B000060MUX,"This is an excellent insight of the pre-war Churchill and his rise through a political elite that was determined to marginalize him. Robert Hardy is superb as Churchill. Neville Chamberlain is portrayed as a man who seems lost in an astounding socialistic dream world while perilous events in Europe threaten England's very survival.

Two cautions: A background knowledge of British politics would be helpful in understanding the full cast of characters and events, especially in the somewhat tedious first four episodes. Also, the transfer appears to be from a video tape rather than an original film and is not especially sharp when played on an HDTV.

Otherwise, this is a fine production and the final four episodes are  compelling. I only wish that the producers could have followed-up with Hardy in the role of the wartime Churchill.",1189296000,3,839,5.109489051094891
1684090,5,B000060MUX,"Previous reviewers have remarked upon the shortcomings of the DVD transfer. It's true that you'll have to crank up the volume. The color's not great.

But what a story! Remember, this isn't the war years; this is the decade of the 30s when Churchill was out of power -- still in Parliament, but not on the cabinet.

This series is a crash course in the British system of government and a incredibly entertaining history lesson. I can't praise it enough. Robert Hardy seems to get more confident in his portrayal the further into the series. By the end, you're looking at him, but actually seeing Churchill.

I don't give many 5 star ratings. This one deserves it.",1165622400,6,663,4.64957264957265
1684091,4,B000060MUX,"Churchill's political story in the 1930s is rendered very well in this work.  Robert Hardy as Churchill delivers an excellent performance.  The dialogue, acting, and general ambience of this series are excellent.  The sound quality on this DVD is questionable, specially Episode 1.  Much of the dialogue seems muffled.  Understanding Baldwin's mumble is quite a chore.  However, after one adjusts to these shortcomings you are sure to get hooked.

One caveat.  You will have to turn up the volume to compensate for the accents.

One can say with regards to Churchill that the ""man and the hour had met"".  Churchill certainly was a major figure in saving Western civilization.  Going through this series I could not but help noticing how privileged a life he led.  The family estate, Checkers, was beautiful with servants galore.",1144972800,7,828,5.097014925373134
1684092,5,B000060MUX,"I saw this in broadcast in 1983, got the DVD several years ago, and have watched it several times since, including last night.  Contrary to those reviewers here who apparently got bad-quality DVD copies, mine is excellent quality, visual and sound.  All the praise for the acting & production offered by the other reviewers is 100% right, and I am reviewing here just to recommend Edward Woodward's performance as Samuel Hoare.  He captures perfectly the contradictions in one man between between personal ambition and genuine commitment to what the country needs, with enough honest perception to not to deceive himself ALL the time (only PART of the time) that whatever is best for his personal advancement must also be best for the country. Most politicians have these competing, conflicting desires, I think, and seldom if ever have they been captured better by an actor.  A fine, fine performance.",1120003200,4,902,5.074324324324325
1684093,4,B000060MUX,"WINSTON CHURCHILL: THE WILDERNESS YEARS is an eight-part mini-series tracing the career of Winston Churchill (Robert Hardy) in the pivotal decade spanning the years 1929-1939.

1- Down and Out - 1929.  Churchill visits  America, wherein he conducts a successful, and remunerative, lecture tour only to invest and lose his money in the stock market crash.

2- Politics Are Foul - 1930-1932.  Parliament wrangles over India.  Stanley Baldwin convinces WC to make intemperate speech and is ousted.  WC out of government and embarks on a second trip to America.

3- In High Places - 1932-1934. Churchill opposes the India bill and loses.  Long digression to explain the behind the scenes maneuvers.  Samuel Hoare, then Secretary of State for India, coerces evidence and invokes Privilege to steer India bill through Parliament.  Invoking privilege and telling the investigating committee that ""he (Hoare) is not a crook"" of course evokes memories of Richard Nixon.

4- A Menace in the House - 1934.  Churchill concludes his fight against corruption in Parliament and meets Ralph Wigram, an official in the Foreign Office, who begins feeding him top secret information on German fighting strength and rearmament.

5- The Flying Peril - 1934-1936.  Churchill, armed with accurate and secret information on Nazi Germany, begins to rally the country to alertness, much to the consternation of the MacDonald government.  MacDonald government falls and is replaced with Baldwin government, which excludes Churchill.

6- His Own Funeral - 1936.  Hitler invades the Rhineland.  Churchill supports the King in congress during the Abdication Crisis, advises against abdication, and loses a great deal of support and popularity.

7- The Long Surrender - 1937-1938.  Hitler's armies stand on the border of Czechoslovakia.  Prime Minister Chamberlain wavers and follows a policy of appeasement, much to the consternation of the vociferous Churchill.

8- What Price Churchill? 1938-1939.  Chamberlain meets with Hitler and signs a pact, returns and declares he has negotiated ""peace in our time.""

  THE WILDERNESS YEARS will appeal to C-SPAN junkies and political wonks.  I've never visited England, know little or nothing of the workings of their political systems, and I've read Martin Gilbert's biographies on Churchill long enough ago to forget most of the particulars, but I found episode 3 and 4 the most interesting.  This is a series that takes its politics seriously, and Churchill's battle against Hoare and the India Bill was fascinatingly detailed.  And clocking in at a total of nearly 7 hours it has the luxury of going into many details indeed.

  I've seen Churchill in old newsreels and have heard him on old recordings, not a lot but enough to be satisfied that Hardy was an excellent choice for the part.  It didn't take me long to buy his performance.  A bit unfortunately, this biography is something of a hagiography as well, and Churchill is glorified at the expense of almost every one of his political opponents.  Perhaps it's a true recording, but the bias is pronounced at times and detracts from the reality of things.  Otherwise a highly enjoyable and educational mini-series.",1113609600,11,3188,5.241584158415842
1684094,4,B000060MUX,"Winston Churchill's Wilderness Years was a period of about 10 years (1928-1939) when the man was out of office and generally at odds with his own political party's leadership over such questions as re-armament, granting independence to India, and the scandal surrounding Edward VIII's plans to marry an American divorcee.  This miniseries - 8 episodes of 50 minutes - covers this time in an entertaining and informative matter.  Granted, the first couple episodes give the feeling that they are plodding from plot point to plot point, but the series settles down into the smooth and enjoyable story of a passionate man whose ideas are not shared by his peers (nor the country in general).

Part of the difficulty of the early episodes is that there is a vast array of characters who are introduced with little or no background.  For audiences outside Britain, this may present a problem.  Those that don't already know Lord Beaverbrook, Prof. Lindemann, or Stanley Baldwin are likely to spend much of the early episodes trying to keep the characters straight.  To the filmakers' credit, however, distinctive actors (they all look different and adopt distinctive mannerisms) are used for the parts, easing the transition into the Churchillian world.  Especially noteworthy is Peter Barkworth as Baldwin and ""The Equalizer"" himself, Edward Woodward, as Samuel Hoare.

Unfortunately, there are some unfortunate portrayals.  This is not the fault of the actors, but rather the director and scriptwriters.  Hitler, for example, is portrayed as a sunken-cheeked angry man, which is the stereotypical Hitler but far removed from his public persona at the height of his popularity in the mid-30's.  Likewise, Churchill's political opponents (Chamberlain, Ramsay Macdonald, etc.) are portrayed as callow, stupid, or bumbling, when by all accounts they were genuine, intellegent men whose only fault was trusting too readily the promises of those more politically cynical and sinister.  Churchill's wife Clemmie is also portrayed in the least favourable light possible, as a selfish and cold wife, jetting off on cruises at a moment's notice caring only for her own comfort.  While she did take numerous trips, they were to get away from an overbearing and selfish husband, the truth of which was well understood by that husband.

But, ultimately, the core of any miniseries about Churchill is the portrayal of Churchill.  Robert Hardy makes a convincing Churchill, capturing his halting speech pattern, his slouching walk, his grimaces, etc.  Comparisons with HBO's ""The Gathering Storm,"" and Albert Finney's portrayal, are inevitable.  For my money, the latter film is more ""truthful"" in that it better captures the essence of Churchill and his extended family (both blood and political).  The Wilderness Years is much more factual - both because it's longer and has time to show more, but also because it makes a greater effort to put things in context and in order.  Both are enjoyable in their own right, and of sufficiently different tone and pace that you're likely to enjoy both on their own merits without noticing that they cover the same material.",1110412800,7,3148,5.222664015904573
1684095,5,B000060MUX,"This is a mini-series of epic proportions.  If you enjoyed the HBO movie, ""The Gathering Storm,"" then this is a must see, and a more detailed oriented movie.  The philosophical battle between Churchill, Baldwin, MacDonald, and finally Chamberlain keeps one glued to the chair.

For a none-English native, though, it is absolutely incomprehensible how the producers could put this movie out without subtitling at least in English! The sound quality is not good (the picture quality far from neither), and for a none- native English too much is lost in the sometimes somewhat muffled colloqial performance, not to speak of the simple fact that Churchill's  famous whisky voice would surely benefit by subtitling...However, it is a must-see all the same! The series appeared on the Danish market in 2006 with Danish subtitling. However, the publishers must have had a severe problem with their bank since they chose to hire a translator whose inability to transform the beautiful English of the 1930'ties into smooth Danish adds only further pain to the viewers' experience, not to speak of the many subtitling printing errors!

It's astounding that the copyright holders of this remarkable series was so hard up that they had to hand ""The Wilderness Years"" over to Lance Entertainment.  This sorry outfit gives Madacy a run for the money as the worst mutilator of film since nitrate.
Robert Hardy is the most convincing imitator of Churchill I've seen.  He is wisely depicted here with his foibles - his rashness and ineptitude in areas beyond his ken, such as the stock market and raising offspring - as well as strengths.  And it's a treat to see Sin Phillips and Tim Pigott-Smith supporting.
Here's a story well-told, with interesting locations, too, from Churchill's home at Chartwell, in UK, to the Arizona desert.  For anyone with an appreciation of the titanic events that shaped World War II, ""The Wilderness Years"" provides invaluable background, not only for Churchill as a major player, but for the others - Baldwin, Beaverbrook, Chamberlain, as well as movers and shakers with unfamiliar names, like the Sir Samuel ""Iago"" Hoare, who manipulated and connived on behalf of appeasement, and Horace Wilson, Chamberlain's oily doorkeeper.
Despite the vandalism of the print by Lance Entertainment, I give 5 Stars because ""The Wilderness Years"" is such an indespensible document that demands viewing.",1079740800,9,1334,5.10091743119266

Hardy was arguably too young to play Churchill here, but his acting is superb, and one forgets the age disparity. This DVD--originally a TV mini-series from 1983, and the picture quality suffers for it--is engrossing, and with more time gives a fuller picture of the 1930s, up through the declaration of war in 1939.

While the drama is not quite as gripping as in ""The Gathering Storm"" the content and depth of this series is excellent (worthy of 5 stars).  Unfortunately the reproduction of this series onto DVD is sub-par.  In fact it is the worst rendering to DVD I have ever seen or heard.  I mention ""heard"" because we can hardly understand some of the dialogues due to poor sound quality.  Either it is too muffled or at times too loud and distorted to make out.

Seller was very quick to make it right and offered a full refund.",1406592000,6,470,4.292134831460674

I had never encountered this problem on any of the many DVD movies,etc
that I have ordered from Amazon.  I thought the problem was that the order came
from Germany and the advertising page had said that the disk would play in the States.
  Again, this had not happened to me before--I wonder if the advertising page was
confusing because there was some orders that indicated it would not play in the States, so I thought I
had clicked on an order that indicated it was compatible with USA DVR players,",1400112000,7,576,4.415094339622642
7957643,5,B000060MUX,"In 1929, Winston Churchill found himself out of office. He was at odds with the government and could not stay in cabinet. He remained at odds with government policy for the next ten years. He wasted his political energy fighting against giving India Dominion status, and in standing up for King Edward VIII. But he also was the lone voice warning against a revived Germany's Nazi ambitions.

Robert Hardy delivers a superbly accurate and realistic portrayal of Great Britain's Last Lion, as do all other cast members. In fact, I much prefer Hardy's performance to Albert Finney's excellent but slightly buffoonish interpretation in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gathering-Storm/dp/B002CWKTUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gathering Storm</a>. He offers a less human Churchill but one more like the Great Man most of us imagine Churchill to have been.

Don't let the poor image and sound quality put you off. This was shot on 16mm film for television in the early 1980s. You cannot expect the same impact as you would from today's high definition television productions. Sadly, they didn't use a new print for a decent DVD transfer.

That said, I am incredibly happy that this production was rescued, even in this degraded state. The script, the acting, the sets, and the costumes make this a first rate production noneless. The story moves along and Churchill's electrifying House of Commons speeches pull the viewer into British 1930s politics.

Finally, Churchill's official biographer, Martin Gilbert, was a co-developer of the series and contributes to making this production as eloquent, passionate, and literate, as Churchill himself would have done. And remember that Churchill won the Nobel Prize for Literature!
