732414,5,6303917410,"If you liked the original, you will love the sequel, or should I say ""prequel""?  Set in 1974, AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION, picks up with The Montelli family (aka: The Defeos) moving into their new home on  112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York.  Before long though, the family  begins to come apart, and adding insult to injury, the oldest son, Sonny -  becomes possessed by demonic forces that originated from the basement.  Soon after, Sonny rituallistically slaughters all of his family members,  and in the end he is unaware of what he has just done.
AMITYVILLE II :  THE POSSESSION will leave you with chills, nightmares, and a desire to  never, never go down to the basement alone again.....",952214400,,703,4.743801652892562
732415,2,6303917410,"I must give unto 'Amityville 2: The Possession' but two stars. This occurs because its 1979 predecessor, superior in acting, atmosphere and cinematic texture, would garner just three of the things from me thanks to its  failure to take off from a potential that Spielberg managed to tap three  years later in 'Poltergeist'.
The movie does play well, though, and it  almost is successful in tailoring itself to the hunger of the Jason  Voorhees/Michael Myers-friendly teen/twenty-something audiences of the  early Eighties. I say 'almost' beacause the formulaic, all-out mayhem and  gore of the 'Friday the 13th' canon just doesn't transpire in this  water-thin offering.
  Maybe a synopsis is in order now: an  Italian-American family moves into the infamous house (this is actually  supposed to be happening prior to the events in the first film) and  problems soon arise when the elder boy, Sonny, begins to experience strange  phenomena such as his walkman (that's right - WALKMAN) headphones urging  him to rise up and slay. Predictably enough, the parish priest becomes  connected with the family and sticks by them, notwithstanding a few doses  of personal animosity from the father, taking confession from the  incestuous daughter, and (perhaps worst of all here) having to pick up the  pieces of the shattered son's soul after he blows the rest of the family to  Kingdom Come. In the final stretches of the picture, the full fury of Sony  Montelli's demonic possession routine boils out over the edge of the scope  of this low-budget flick.  To be fair, despite its flagrant  shortcomings on the production front, number two is streets ahead of any of  the ensuing 'Amityvilles' (number three being a one-star and the others  being half of that at best). While it's not really scary (but then, was the  first one?) and suffers from the absence of is predecessor's soup-thick  atmosphere, the film keeps itself from self-negating in style by its  slasher appearance. There's something about the lack-lustre acting and the  humour to be found in a few of the sequences (as when the paintbrushes  scrawl 'Pigs....dishonor thy father' on the little Montelli's bedroom wall,  thereby provoking the father to draw his belt) that is worth defending in a  critical treatment. 'Amityville 2' is good, shallow, Saturday night  entertainment and is worth seeing once. Still, as HBO is always playing  that kind of stuff, anyway, why bother injecting your precious dollars into  something you'll feel duty-bound to watch more than once. Hopefully, logic  will prevail here; you know your bank balance wants it to, anyhow.....",951868800,4,2621,5.14251781472684

732777,4,6303917410,"Amityville II is every bit as good as its predecessor, and receives a welcome injection of sleaze courtesy of Italian director Damiano Damiani who has directed classics in the western, crime-thriller and giallo genres. Set as a prequel, this film explores the Dafoe murders and stars a wonderfully scuzzy Burt Young as the head of the clan. The yummy Diane Franklin gets an incest scene with her brother and there's a fair bit of violence and gore.

The MGM DVD is one of those double-sided affairs, with an anamorphic print in 1.85:1 ratio and a full-screen print. Pity the series didn't continue in this vein, as the strictly PG level Amityville 3 was bad and then it spun off into all sorts of weird areas.",1422489600,,709,4.672

The horror itself is sub- to mere standard. Very average effects, and some things that are supposed to be scary but aren't (I'm talking to you, evil voice from a Walkman).
But the honestly disturbing stuff, the things you'll walk away remembering, were all in place before the family ever walked into that house. An abusive, damaged, incestuous mess, it's never a surprise for the viewer that things fall apart here- only that it took the supernatural to make it happen.",1395532800,,587,4.821782178217822
732870,4,6303917410,"Amityville II: The Possession (1982) is a well done prequel to the original The Amityville Horror (1979).  This 1982 movie shows what happened in the house one year prior to the events that unfolded in the first movie from 1979, and is loosely based on a true story.  I think this movie is as good as the original 1979 movie, and sometimes I think it's even better.  I saw this movie some time in the early to mid 1980s on cable TV.  This movie goes too far at times and a lot of what happens is plain over the top, but I don't feel it detracts from the film too much.  This is an entertaining demonic possession movie, bottom line.  The acting is fair to pretty good.  The most disturbing scene in the movie is cringe-worthy and will make you wonder what the sister was thinking when her brother was requesting she do certain things he wanted her to do!

This movie definitely rips off The Exorcist (1973) during the last third of the movie.  No doubt about that.  Also, the last third of the movie, which involves the priest dealing with the murderous son, goes on too long and occurs after all the climatic scenes have already taken place.  The movie basically ends with a thud.  I would have given this movie 5 stars if it had a stronger, more powerful ending, but overall this movie is disturbing, shocking, over the top at times, and features a dysfunctional American family.

Highly recommended.",1393286400,2,1402,4.4940711462450595

Even today this 1982 film stands up and still scares and thrills. This is the story of what happened before the family from the original Amityville Horror moved in.

There are sub plots involving incest and domestic abuse and they are disturbing as are a lot of content in horror films today..The scares come when the Older brother Sonny played by (Jack Magner) slowly becomes posessed by a demon and starts acting demented,another thing that was so effective was how slowly Sonny`s physical transformation took place,I actually think he was more frightening halfway through the transformation but again the end result was still effective.

 The atmosphere such as music,sound and visuals were done extremely well as to keep it creepy and scary because it could have easily gone the other way.

Burt Young and Rutanya Alda rounded out a great ensemble cast. I don't think this movie ever got the accolades it deserved because it was a sequel and the comparison To The Exorcist.",1383091200,,1182,4.8316831683168315
732932,5,6303917410,"when i saw the Amityville Horror DVD release out of curiosity i found out there was a sequel aswell
released on VHS a few years after
so i bought the Sequel aswell called Amityville Horror II The Possession released on VHS in 1982-83
and while watching the film i realized that this film is actually a Prequel to the original 1978 classic
it tells the story of the family that once lived in the Amityville House 1 year before James Brolin and Margo kidders character's were in the House
the film is set 1 year before James Brolin and Margo kidder move in the House.

The Directing and Acting in this prequel is incredible absolutely stunning, another supernatural thriller
tons of suspense and violence from the first scene, Brilliant acting by Burt young who plays the father abusing his 4 kids
some scenes are actually disturbing and hard to watch
not much Gore but tons of suspense in every scene, this film actually shows how violent the father is to his kids and wife
and how the eldest son gets a shotgun and kills his whole family, you don't see the killing but you see the shotgun blasts
the eldest son gets possessed by the Evil spirits in the House and that's the whole plot really
but the way the film is Directed and acted incredible piece of work 10/10 suspense

the 2005 DVD release has a very Good widescreen transfer, Great Picture and audio better than VHS quality anyway
No special features/extras all, there is Theatrical trailer but that is it.

i know for a fact that scream factory are releasing this film on blu-ray on Oct 1st this year
this new blu-ray has all brand new special features
has interviews with the Director and some of the cast from the film, Burt young has passed away now so i don't think he's interviewed.

so it's up to you, get this 2005 DVD release and the blu-ray release or just buy the Blu-ray release
but i gave this film 5 star rating based on incredible acting and directing of the film.",1380326400,3,1937,4.494318181818182
732933,4,6303917410,"It is this pre-quel ""Amityville II: The Possession"" from 1982 that outclasses its original 1979's cheesy success.  Producer Dino De Laurentiis was smart to hire Damiano Damiani to direct (this is his only Hollywood production) and Damiani wisely uses Franco DiGiacomo as director of photography and production designer Pierluigi Basile who effectively present along with Special Make-up by John Caglione, Jr. and special effects supervisor, Glen Robinson, a believable aura of evil that makes the entire film satisfying in itself.  Tommy Lee Wallace based his script on the book, ""Murder in Amityville"" by Hans Holzer, a different book than what the 1979 film was based which was co-written by members of the Lutz family, who escaped from the house.  The Holzer book and ""Amityville II"" is concerned with how the horrible murders that happened prior to the Lutz family's occupation of the house, and reasons for the evil that causes one member of the Montelli family to become possessed.  The fact that the film dwells on the possession and some of its concerns rightly conjure up association with ""The Exorcist"" (as sometimes the oldest son, ""Sonny"" played by Jack Magner often looks like Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" but Damiani relies on his make-up and special effects people who outwit these potentially deadly flaws in the script.  Even the religious detail in the film seems well researched.  One aspect unique about the film and demonic possession has the boy's defense in court use ""demonic possession"" and further heads down slippery avenues when the priest (played by top-billed James Olson) is given an attempt to exorcize the boy with unofficial ""consent"" from law enforcement.  Burt Young, Rutanya Alda (who I have never before seen star in anything (she played ""Caroline the maid"" in ""Mommie Dearest"") are the parents and Diane Franklin effectively portrays the teen-age daughter, ""Patricia.""  Damiani tastefully handles the incest aspect and the other abuses the family inflicts upon themselves making them qualifiers for the evil in the house and our sympathies.  Lalo Schifrin (music) and Sam O'Steen (editor) are Hollywood pros on hand.  The film can stand alone apart from the original or any other ""Amityville.""  In Technicolor, the MGM disc is in full screen on one side, widescreen on the other and comes with a theatrical trailer.  Definitely top-drawer given the original was not.  These derivative aspects, like those of ""The Exorcist,"" are skillfully handled.  The Cadillac of ""Amityville.""  Goes where other films never do, and never fails to deliver.

Even though the film makers changed the name of the family I find it very RUDE that the filmmakers had an incestual relationship between the oldest children. To me that was just not only disgusting but  spitting in the face of a real life  crime victim. She is not here to defend herself.

I know this was not ""True Story"" but it is loosely based on true events. When filmmakers do this its wrong. If they were so HELLBENT on having this event in the film they should of just change the setting and call it something else.

I wouldn't of mind it if it was called anything else but ""Amityvile"" was wrong.  The original family that was murdered their story has been turned into a money making machine.  What is really sad is that they are not here to defend the rumors about themselves.",1376697600,,901,4.359281437125748
732937,1,6303917410,Super corny. Terrible writing and acting. Couldn't get more than 15 minutes into it before I stopped watching it. Was obvious from the first seconds of the movie it was not going to be worth watching.,1376524800,,200,4.583333333333333
732938,5,6303917410,"Wow!  For some reason I've been ignoring Amityville II: The Possession over the years.  This is either because I was told a long time ago that it wasn't worth watching or maybe I convinced myself nothing can top the original.  What a gigantic mistake!  All I did was deprive myself of a great horror film.

The best way to describe Amityville II is that, while it doesn't repeat the same exact hauntings from the original, the movie overall takes similar themes and makes them more intense.  The trade off however, is that the film doesn't build the suspense as successfully as the original probably a result of the movie writers assuming we'd all seen the original so suspense wasn't as much a concern.  This means when the odd events occur, they happen almost right away (well, 15 minutes into the movie).  In other words, when strange events occur (such as a gust of strange weird blowing in front a side door in a basement, or a curtain floating around and covering a cross hanging on the wall) it sometimes feels forced.  Maybe the ghosts were desperate for anyone to come along and couldn't contain themselves.

Some of the hauntings are also exaggerated to the point that it loses its effectiveness in scaring the viewer, such as the scene with the two kids playing in the kitchen and suddenly the refrigerator explodes and the whole kitchen goes haywire.  This isn't one of the scariest moments in my opinion due to the extreme nature of it- subtle scares are more suitable and the moments I *truly* want to see.  That's how it worked in the original.  I also think it would have been better if the voices telling the older brother to kill weren't so clear and obvious.  The writers probably should have kept the voices absent for the viewers, so only the brother could hear them.  Really minor complaint.

However, who really cares?  I'm only nitpicking over minor details anyway.  This movie is awesome.  It's about the next family that moves into the haunted Amityville horror house.  Strange events occur between the older brother and sister mainly, and without spoiling too much, let's just say, do you remember the events surrounding the family that was murdered?  This aspect of the storytelling is what *this* movie plays on, and does so remarkably well.

I find the scene with the family sitting around eating dinner at the table when suddenly the mirror rattles and falls over especially alarming.  Why?  Because about a year ago I had a dream VERY similar to this.  I've never seen this movie until yesterday so it's really bizarre.  The only difference is that, in my dream, the mirror didn't rattle off the wall.  Instead the fictional family my brain created looked like demons whenever I looked in the mirror.  This dream of mine and the atmosphere/tone of the first two Amityville Horror movies was almost identical, though.

I feel that the cast isn't as memorable as the ones from the original.  Burt Young plays an angry abusive father and his wife Rutanya Alda doesn't feel as memorable either.  James Brolin and Margot Kidder are much better parents, I think.  I wish the family in Amityville II: the Possession weren't so abruptly abusive towards each other and their children.  They'd constantly smack each other around, either a result of the haunted house or perhaps they really believed that's how a family should be.  Not too fond of these moments.  I do believe had Burt Young been given more time to develop his character, he'd have been as awesome as James Brolin.  However, for the most part, this movie is all about the older brother and sister.

Perhaps the final 30 minutes is a slight letdown.  After *something* happens (too big of a storyline segment for me to spoil here on amazon) a priest comes along demanding an exorcism.  Two problems- this dramatically takes away from the suspense that was so rewarding in the first half, and two, it's too similar to the Exorcist.  Either way, I'm really pleased with the quality of this movie and I totally enjoyed it enough that 5 stars is a fair rating.  Highly recommended.",1371772800,,4064,4.748571428571428
732995,4,6303917410,"If you like The Exorcist, you'll probably like this movie. I thought it would just tell the story of the family that lived there, but it went beyond that.  We all know the story of Amityville, the brother that murders each member of his family because he hears voices.  This movie shows the family moving in and then all the creepy stuff that happens to them from the moment they set foot in that house.  After the murders, you see the priest trying to exorcise the brother.  It reminded me of the Exorcist, just like when you see Linda Blair's character looking totally gross and demonic and speaking in that creepy voice.  I don't know about you, but I find that stuff extremely creepy.  What I did not like is that most of the movie took place in the dark, at night.

The flaming a-hole dad is played by Burt Young, a familiar face when you need a tough guy. He's probably most famous for his role in the Rocky movies, but I remember him best as Rodney Dangerfield's limo driving thug in Back to School. Siblings Sonny (Jack Magner) and Patricia (Diane Franklin) have a very strange flirty and incestuous relationship, even prior to Sonny's possession. Sonny listens to free-form jazz/post-punk on his walkman, amongst his satanic orders. It is quite evident early on that the place is haunted. The haunting itself is so over the top, it borders on parody. No subtlety here. The demon is quite the artist, too, painting an elaborate message for the little kids. Patricia reaches out to the family priest, who would rather go on a hiking trip than answer his phone in a time of need. This movie was on Rue Morgue's list of ""200 Alternative Horror Films You Need to See,"" and I'm hard pressed to see why.

733004,5,6303917410,"I watched this film for maybe the 3rd time yesterday and felt it was time to write a review. I honestly don't view it that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets ""fun"" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called ""goofy"", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. Amazon usually sells this movie for practically nothing so if you like the Amityville story or just horror movies in general, you should buy this ASAP.",1355443200,,1831,4.551515151515152

733184,4,6303917410,"After 80 reviews here you would think there was nothing left of the plot to be given away. But wait.

I am not a fan of horror movies and can't make comments from the perspective of someone who follows the genre. But every so often I drop in to see what is going on. It can be fun in small doses. That said, this is one that I found to be predictably corny and yet it was really interesting because of something about the plot that I could not put my finger on as the story unfolded.

Now here is the PLOT SPOILER. In the end the demon tricks the priest who wants to exorcise the demon from the boy into giving the demon permission to take over the priest's own body and soul.

The ending was really disturbing if you think about it. The boy is now free of the demon, but he has no way of proving that he was not responsible for his own actions and that his freed-up self is quite innocent. Thus the innocent boy will certainly end up paying for the murder of his family and will wallow in guilt and sorrow. A sickening thought. The efforts to save  him by priest and cop simply ended up creating a situation that was destined to play out as a terrible injustice.

At the same time the priest had gotten so involved in trying to save the boy and thinking he could do it himself that he invited the demon to take over his own body in place of the boy's. This may be Christ-like, to be the sacrificial lamb, but it would not save the boy, and it would only give the demon an entry into the Church. The priest was loaded with pride on the inside even though he seemed like a nice enough guy.

With the end in mind I realized that much of the story had been the demon setting up the priest. It had been a cat and mouse game all along. The demon was always two steps ahead of the priest. I had not thought about it this way as I watched the film, but I think I sensed that there was something more going on than meets the eye and probably that is why I did not fast-forward through a lot of basically corny stuff.

The priest lets himself get all involved with the family and gets frustrated that he can't help them. He has no humility in this regard. The demon apparently predicted that the girl would go to the priest with her story of incest and get him to imagining sexual things about her. The priest has absolute faith that he can exorcise the demon and will go to any lengths, do stupid things, to exorcise the thing. In the end he has been tricked and the demon has found a way into the priest's body and presumably the Church.

A lot of people might say, ""but the demon can't really go into the Church, can he?""  Well, that belief is shattered because there he is in the priest's robes and beneath his crucifix as the film ends. So why not into the Church buildings and community? I think that was his main objective, while having fun spewing evil along the way.

If you are inclined to think of the story as a set-up cat and mouse game strategically, perhaps you will not find it so boring as some people here did, or even as I found much of it to be not anticipating the twist at the end. So I am not sure that my PLOT SPOILER will literally spoil it for you. Maybe the suggestion will make it a little more interesting.

PS: As long as I am giving things away -- you might wonder what did the demon represent? I suppose there could be another level here. Usually we think in Western mythology of a war between good and evil, with the Church standing for good and the Devil standing for evil. In this case it might not be so clear. The house is haunted because it was built over an old Indian burial ground. The demon was presumably sent for revenge against the arrogant Christians from Europe who just saw their sacred land as real estate and disturbed their spirits. This is not good against evil in the usual sense that we have learned to expect in such films. It is not in your face, but if you think about it this is about revenge not simply evil. The arrogance or pride of the priest and of his Church represents the arrogance of the civilization that violated the Indians. This would sound a bit cheap or trite moralistic-trendy if it were more in your face in the film, but it is not a bad point if you work it out on your own. This is a rare horror film (in my limited exposure) because if you are inclined, it actually gives you psychological and moralistic things to think about.",1300579200,2,4396,4.184397163120567
733185,4,6303917410,"Strange things are happening at 112 Ocean Avenue. Just as the Montelli family have moved into their humble abode, arms start coming out of walls, blood starts gushing from the water faucets and what we can only assume is ghostly fecal matter has started to flood the basement. These are the least of the families worries, however. Regular beatings aside, the family finds their routine shaken up when the eldest Montelli child starts rebelling. It turns out he is being possessed by some sort of demon and just when you think things couldn't get any worse, they get much worse. Much worse.

""Amityville II: The Possession"" is a prequel to the 1979 semi-classic ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amityville-Horror/dp/B0008191WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amityville Horror</a>"" and is (very) loosely based on the DeFeo murders that took place in the famed house before the Lutz family moved in. The script, as penned by Tommy Lee Wallace, is about as brutal and dark as it can get. Just when you think the film won't go there, it goes there. We're talking children being treated violently, a relationship between brother and sister that goes too far and the worst offender of all: the farting priest. See the DVD at exactly the 26 minute mark for evidence.

The first two thirds of the film set things up beautifully. The film is stylishly shot by Damiano Damiani, giving the film a visual edge over its predecessor. While the sequel comes very close to besting the first film, it unfortunately comes crumbling down in the third act. Without giving too much away, the main business is dealt with in the first hour, leaving the last forty minutes to just sort of dangle in the wind a bit. To quote Jerry Seinfeld, ""that's a pretty big matzo ball hanging out there."" Somehow the film becomes an odd amalgamation of the first film and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>"" and in doing so, does a great disservice to itself.

When compared to the later installments in the series, this one at least comes out on top. In spite of its awkward ending, it's still a disturbing and thrilling ride that will take even the most jaded by surprise. Fans will get a thrill out of a story that takes things to the next level, while the average viewer will get a kick out of seeing Uncle Paulie himself, Burt Young, going off the deep end.

As soon as the movie started I knew right away there was gonna be action between her & the older brother eventually even if he hadn't gotten possessed just by the way they were interacting upon arriving at the house. I was dissappointed with the scene when it finally arrived, they could've done alot better than that. I guess it was cool seeing Diane half nude anyways. I didn't like alot of the rest of the movie, man these people acted so pathetic, they were such awesome targets for the ghost or ghost's because they already had problems wayy before the spirits started messin with them. Rocky's brother N law played a good drunk asshole once again, that dude was made for those types of roles. Didn't like seeing the family murdered the way they were, that was really hardcore even the two youngest children weren't spared, damn.

733244,3,6303917410,"This is one sick little horror movie. It plays out less like a haunted house film, and more like ""The Exorcist""-Lite. In this film, we are introduced to the Montelli family, a family so messed up they make the mutant clan in ""The Hills Have Eyes"" look normal...and that is before the possession even begins. The loving father played by Burt Young in full ""Paulie"" mode from ""Rocky"" enjoys his cigars and drinks with a big old helping of abuse. He smacks just about everyone in a 10 yard radius of him throughout the film. You have the jeebus-freak Mom who manages to make almost every numbskull decision possible, all while hoping the local priest will come and bless this whole mess. You get a couple young kids thrown into the mix, which really gets disturbing as things play out on screen. And to top it off, you get a really odd pair of teens....who are close...I mean they get really close...as things unfold. What makes this truly disturbing it the fine acting job done by both Jack Magner as older brother Sonny, and Diane Franklin as sweet, but naive Patricia. As the story unfolds, you can't help but sucked into this sordid little slice of family life.
Of course, once the Possession begins, the family's only hope is the typical 1970's Hero-Priest, Father Adamsky. To be honest, I think the family would have been better off consulting a bag of doorknobs than this guy, who wants every ""detail"" of Patricia's sexual experience, and who decided to go camping with his ""friend"" in the middle of a parishoner's crisis?!

733250,4,6303917410,"When ""The Amityville Horror"" arrived on screens across the country in 1979, the movie was a smash hit. People obviously bought into the weird goings on that supposedly really occurred (Really!) in the creepy looking house in Amityville, New York as described by George and Kathy Lutz, the occupants of aforementioned home who fled into the night after witnessing extremely evil supernatural phenomena. As the years went on, and we learned that the Lutz clan fabricated the whole story, people soon forgot the real tragedy that happened in the house a few months before George and Kathy concocted their elaborate con. Meet the DeFeo family, specifically father Ronald DeFeo Sr and his son Ronald Jr. The two never really got along, largely because the father was a jerk and the son was a heavy drug user. On the night of November 13, 1974 Ronald DeFeo ran into a tavern claiming that someone had killed his parents. Sure enough, the cops found Ronald Sr and his wife Louise in bed with two holes in their heads. Then they found Ronald's four brothers and sisters dead, also shot in the head. DeFeo eventually confessed to murdering his entire family and went to prison for the rest of his life.

There you go. We have a gruesome mass killing without any supernatural origins whatsoever. That's not good enough for Hollywood. They want you to believe that an evil spirit possessed Ronald DeFeo, drove him insane, and manipulated him into killing his family. Exhibit A in this argument is Jay Anson's book ""The Amityville Horror,"" which posits that the DeFeo killings stemmed from supernatural evil. Exhibit B is Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel to the first film, ""Amityville II: The Possession"". Where the first film looked at the misadventures of George and Kathy Lutz, ""Amityville II"" examines the events leading up to the DeFeo murders. Mostly. Actually, only the first part of the movie looks at Ronald's carnage. The second part devolves into an ""Exorcist"" ripoff. Of course, the movie doesn't refer directly to the DeFeo family. Here, we meet the Montelli clan, headed up by abusive father Anthony (Burt ""Yo Paulie!"" Young) and his neurotic wife Dolores (Rutanya Alda). Along for the ride are eldest child Sonny (Jack Magner), daughter Patricia (Diane Franklin), and rug rats Jan (Erika Katz) and Mark (Brent Katz). As the film opens, we see the family moving in and checking out their new digs. Fun stuff.

Several things become readily apparent. One, Rutanya Alda camps it up in a way that makes later stage Bette Davis look mild in comparison. Two, something evil lives in a slimy crawlspace beneath the house. Three, Anthony Montelli seems awfully proud of his firearm collection. Four, and lastly, the first part of the film essentially consists of Tony beating the tar out of his loved ones. The end. O.k., not really. Actually, that something in the basement seems to lock on to Sonny like a cruise missile. In no time at all he's walking around like the living dead, causing all sorts of problems for everyone. In one horrific scene, he does something with his sister Patricia that should massively disturb the viewer. Eventually the murders take place. Then we come to the second part of the film, which centers around one Father Adamsky (James Olson) and his attempts to uncover the reasons behind Sonny's rampage. He does a lot of research in the library, uncovers a few nasty little secrets stretching back through the centuries, and has his own problems with Sonny. I won't spoil the ending for you except to say, or rather scream at the top of my lungs, THE EXORCIST!

It's tough not to like ""Amityville II: The Possession"". As another reviewer noted elsewhere, you simply must adore a movie that shows someone shotgunning Paulie to death. The film earns an extra star just for that scene alone. Too, the movie picks up bonus points for ratcheting up the sleaze factor. I'm not sure if this picture had a theatrical run, but I can only imagine the disgust the audience felt when that scuzzy scene involving Sonny and Patricia unfolded in all its nauseating glory. I'll bet people walked out after seeing that. It's even tougher to watch because Diane Franklin is such a pretty, vivacious young lady. O.k., she's gorgeous. That knowledge sort of puts the male viewer in a bad place. Anyway, once that scene fades into memory we're left with the second part of the film, which is actually pretty ridiculous and, as I said earlier, a ripoff of the much better ""The Exorcist"". Still, the special effects seen as Sonny morphs into something very hideous aren't that bad. The problem I had while watching this part of the movie is that I know the DeFeo story quite well. I'm pretty sure Ronald didn't change into a demon in the attic of the house.

""Amityville II: The Possession"" arrived on DVD because a remake of the original 1979 film came out in 2005. You know those savvy marketing people in Hollywood! Too bad they released a film to disc with only the original trailer as an extra! Bummer. The one saving grace is the nice audio and the quality widescreen picture transfer. As a final note, I found it extremely interesting that Damiano Damiani directed the film. He's one of those Italian directors that made films like the spaghetti western ""A Bullet for the General"" and crime dramas such as ""Confessions of a Police Captain"". In other words, he's made a lot of great movies exploitation cinema fans adore. How he got this gig, however, remains a mystery to me. He did a pretty good job with what he had to work with, I must say, although the movie really is a ripoff of other, better flicks.

This film shows us what had happened to the DeFeo's and what they had experience, up to their tragic death. You see, the Lutz's have escaped with their lives, but the house's previous tenants were not so lucky.

  The Montelli family (the name was changed from DeFeo to Montelli in order to keep Ronald DeFeo, Jr. from getting any kind of pay from this movie) were not exactly the perfect family, but they figured they could try to become the perfect family after they bought the perfect house in Amityville, New York: 112 Ocean Avenue to be exact. The Montelli consists of ANTHONY (played by Burt Young, who I can only see as good ole Paulie from ROCKY), his wife DELORES (played by R utanya Alda), and their four children, SONNY (played by Jack Magner), PATRICIA ""TRICIA"" (played by Diane Franklin), JAN (played by Erika Katz), and Mark (played by Brent Katz). While helping Delores unpack some of things that belong in the basement, one of the movers finds another room that is the back of the basement, but he discovers the room to be to messy and muddy, and advises that Delores and her family stay away from that part of the basement.

  Later that night as the family sits down to their first dinner in their new home, the mirror suddenly falls off the wall as Delores begins to say Grace over their meal. While everyone is getting ready for bed, Mark and Jan witness two or three paint brushes paint a hideous picture of a demon on their wall. This was done by an unseen force, leading into an unseen force wrecking havoc in the room. Anthony yells at the children and is ready to whip them with his belt, until Delores steps in and fights with Anthony. He continues to hit Delores until Sonny, without thinking, suddenly pulls the gun on his own father. That night, while listening to his headphones, Sonny's cassette player stops, where a deep and horrifying voice comes in saying, ""...Why didn't you pull the trigger? Why didn't you kill that pig?""

  The next afternoon, Delores has FATHER ADAMSKY (played by James Olson) to stop by and bless the family's home, but as Mark and Jan are getting a glass of water for Father Adamsky, everything in the kitchen breaks and crashes to the floor by unseen force. This happens as Father Adamsky is introduced to Sonny. Anthony yells out the children terribly, where Father Adamsky leaves. He approaches his car to find that just about every page in his copy of The Bible is ripped to shreds. What is going on? Well, sit tight, because there is more to tell.

  Delores informs Anthony to drive down to the Church to apologize to Father Adamsky in front of both his wife and children. Sonny stays behind, for Sonny is not feeling well. As he sits around doing nothing, he hears some noises that don't belong. He heads down to the basment, with a rifle in hand, and heads into that small room the mover had discovered. What Sonny finds is not pretty, for it is an evil spirit, which suddenly possesses Sonny. Sonny approaches Tricia's room, hours after the family has returned. Sonny begins...flirting with his own sister, where the two distgustingly go ""all the way"" (Ewwww!!!! give me a bottle pepto, will ya?)

  They next day, while Anthony is not around, Delores has Father Adamsky come by again to bless the house. All seems well until he blesses the Montelli's bed, where blood begins pouring out. But Delores and Father Adamski have only hallucinated...or did they? That afternoon, the family throws a party for Sonny, all seems well, until Sonny stands there looking at his parents, and two sisters and brother, where he then hears that same voice again, ""Look at them. Their pathetic. It'll be better when you kill them"". Shivering yet?

  That night, it finally happens...Sonny, fully possessed, kills his entire family with a shotgun rifle. The next morning, after dreaming something terrible, Father Adamsky races to the house, and finds the entire family dead, with Sonny still alive, as well as being the obvious suspect. But this is not his fault, for Sonny is under demonic possession. Weeks go by, where Father Adamsky, who already knows that something evil is in that house, finds out about the evil that is in the house, and does all he can to save Sonny. He pulls Sonny out of the psychiatric ward and tries to bring him to the Church, but Sonny bashes Father Adamsky over the head and disappears. Father Adamsky knows that Sonny will only go to one place: 112 Ocean Ave. He heads there and finds Sonny, with the Demon's full face in view. Without the approval from the Church, Father Adamsky performs an exorcism, where the exorcism goes off successfully, for Sonny is free of the unclean spirit, but Father Adamsky is now infected with the Demon.

  Just like the first film, this sequel scared the ever-loving crap out of me. I pretty much slept with the covers over my head.

The Amityville house had a history long before the Lutz's moved in, and thats what the posession tries to tell of. It tells the story of a teen possessed by the spirit or spirits that dwell in the house, picking up the story of the original true slaying before the Lutz's took possession (no pun intended) of the now infamous ominous windowed house.

As stated in previous reviews, the performances by anyone other than the priest are questionable at times, but this film is an homage to unknown evil, not unknown actors.

The pace is similar to the first for 3/4ths of the movie, but more twisted elements are thrown in for good measure. The walls being graffiti tagged by the ghosts and a blood spewing holy water sprinkler were some effective early story tools. Some clever camera techniques help to scare up the scene leading up to Sonny's possesion. The end is quite over the top, but that's fine because the filmmakers did manage to make a ghastly, gory image laden finale that is a must see for any fans of the genre.

Yes, the camera shots and well-exercised steady-cam evoke 'The Evil Dead', and, yes, the final third of the film is a dumb 'Exorcist' knock off. But that's just nitpicking. 'Amityville II: The Possession' is a hoot of a haunted house movie that isn't afraid to dabble in incest, child abuse, marital rape, exorcism and automatic handwriting. In other words, it covers ALL the bases.

As a loose 'prequel' to the first film, 'Amityville II: The Possession' commences with the Montelli family gleefully staking their claim upon America's favourite Indian burial ground. Before too long, there's blood coming from pipes, spirits rattling doors and some funky fashions that evoke the threads from 'Boogie Nights'. Indeed, young Sonny Montelli (Jack Magner) bears a striking resemblance to Mark Wahlberg, but instead of getting it on in some low rent adult films, Sonny decides instead to deflower his sister, Patricia. Boy, he needs a better agent (and so does she!).

Strangely, it is the 'family romance' at the heart of 'Amityville II' that is so intriguing. Big brother sleeps with sister. Local priest wants to sleep with same sister. Mom won't sleep with Dad. Local priest goes 'camping' with 'close friend'. From the Marlene Dietrich and Jim Morrison posters conspicuously in view, to the emphasis upon the slime in the basement, it appears that Oedipal trauma is a big thing for the 'Amityville II' film makers. When Sonny finally follows The Lizard King's instructions (Dude! You were meant to get it on with your MOTHER, not your SISTER!), the film hits a high point that makes the preceeding 60 minutes more than worth the wait. Guided by some instructions from his Walkman (no doubt the lyrics to Twisted Sister's 'We're Not Gonna Take It'), Sonny undertakes some target practice without leaving the comfort of his own home. Indeed, the family 'execution' is quite unsettling, and the close-ups of Sonny doing his best Stanley Kubrick 'psycho' impersonation quite eerie.

But given that most of the cast have now been eradicated (and moved on to better things...like episodes of 'MacGyver'), the film is left with a boring priest who attempts to save Sonny from his 'possession'. The final 20 minutes include the requisite barfing, crucifix jousting, house bleeding and lurid demonic verbal gymnastics but, alas, no more shots of a scantily clad Patricia (she gives the priest a tongue lashing, however, so things aren't all bad).

So, if Mom and Dad have denied you the use of the car for the weekend, or you happen to be an angry loner, watch 'Amityville II: The Possession'. However - as the neighbours have been telling the various occupants of the Amityville house year after year - RENT, don't buy. :)",1113955200,2,2739,5.010989010989011
733374,4,6303917410,"Despite its many detractors, ""Amityville II"" is not your typical bargain basement horror flick. For starters, the movie makes no claims it is ""based on a true story"", it only suggests the events of the 1975 DeFeo murders, so this should not be viewed as a documentary. The movie is filled with evocative imagery: tilting camerawork, POV shots, and the house itself is shot to guarantee maximum creepiness. The scene where the family is murdered will forever be etched in my memory; it is gruesome, disturbing and unforgettable in its raw intensity. Isn't that the hope of any good horror movie? The theme music by Lalo Shifrin (returning from the first film) remains spine tingling, even today, and the film as a whole puts today's horror flicks (including the dreary remake of the original), in which the emphasis is on quik cuts and flashiness than atmosphere and suspense, to shame. You want a good fright? Watch this film.",1113868800,2,926,4.867088607594937
733375,5,6303917410,"There have been about  six or so Amityville films since the original, and I'd have to say that this one is my fave.  That goes against popular opinion, but when have I ever agreed with popular opinion?  I'm gonna give y'all spoilers galore(including the ending) so stop now if you really want the film to be a surprise.  Amityville 2, like the original, carries the ""based on a true story"" tagline, but don't be fooled.  Like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, about 2% of this is probably actually true.  I doubt the real life guy who shot his family was possessed by a demon.  This is also a prequel, so it could actually be viewed as the first film.  Rocky's brother, Paulie(Burt Young) and his family move into the dreaded house.  It's established right off the bat that Burt's a very strict, cranky and possibly abusive father to his wife and four kids.  Of course, when has Burt Young ever played a lovable guy?  Is he even capable?  It quickly turns out that he is abusive.  The first 40 minutes or so of the film are the traditional Amityville spookhouse goings on that you'd come to expect.  Alot of these are actually handled quite effectively, some even better than the first film.  You got the room full of flies and poop where the demons supposedly dwell, a demon howl of pain when they look at a crucifx, stuff moving around, and the always effective knocking at the door when no one's there.  Calling a priest in to bless the house is just as bad of an idea as it was in the first film.  The priest slowly becomes the central character of the film, and he's actually a pretty cool guy.  He tries to convince his superiors that the house is haunted and he needs permission to exorcise it.  Naturally the catholics aren't in a hurry to do this and take their sweet time with their decision while the situation at the house gets worse.  By this time, the oldest son has become possessed while home alone in a very long sequence that ends with him apparently being used as a human trampoline by an invisible demon.  Once possessed, his veins pulsate, his headphones start talking to him and he decides to sleep with his sister.  It's an uncomfortable and comical scene.  It's also not that surprising coz the relationship between the siblings gave you an uncomfortable vibe right from the beginning.  You had the weird feeling this kind of thing would have happened between them eventually, possession or not, coz she goes along with it so easily.  Pretty soon the demonic headphones tell Sonny to kill his family which he does in a rather brutal and suspenseful sequence.  You wouldn't see a drawn out scene like this in any Hollywood film made today.  It's not gory, it's just disturbing.  He even flips his younger sister's foot with the barrel of his gun to see if she's dead-a deliciously morbid touch.  Sonny's arrested and the priest comes more into play.  Now it's a full throttle ripoff of the Exorcist.  I realized this, but was able to accept it coz I don't set the bar too high when dealing with B horror films.  And the ripoff is so in your face that it's hard not to find it amusing.  I'm talking direct scenes from The Exorcist like the words, ""Save Me"" appearing on his arm right down to the ending where the priest doing the exorcism ends up getting possessed himself in order to save the kid.  The priest tries to get Sonny out of jail in order to get him to a church to perform the ritual, but A)Getting a guy off in a court of law with a ""demonic possession"" defense doesn't work.  Very funny scene with the lawyer stating, ""The boy's a victim of demonic possession-Possession by demons....Therefore INNOCENT!""  And B)  The priest has still not been cleared by the church to do this exorcism.  So, with the help of a sympathetic police chief, he goes rogue, busting the kid out of jail and going against the church, all leading to the final showdown at the dreaded Amityville house.  Like I said, I really like this movie.  I've seen the rest in the series, and they're okay I guess, but this one just seems so much darker and demented than the rest.  It achieves an uncomfortable, creepy atmosphere coz of it's music, it's disturbing family and mostly darkly lit scenes.  A nice relic of early 80s horror where directors could get away with things they could never get away with now.  This pathetic looking remake of the first film probably won't achieve one fraction of the atmosphere or uneasiness of this film.  Sure the effects will be much more high tech, but effects are a lousy distraction for lack of storytelling or genuine chills.  There you have it.

733467,3,6303917410,"""Amityville II: Possession"" is actually one impressively repulsive little flick, trafficking as it does in a massively dysfunctional family, incest, bloody murder, demonic possession, priests neglecting needy parishioners to go romping off on a hunting expedition, heads exploding like rotten melons, and lots of nasty creepy slimy things factory designed to go bump in the night.

And yet for all this slick, heavy, oily coating of sleaze, Italian director Damiano Damiani (who had directed absolutely nothing outside of Italy until he took the helm of this ""Amityville Horror"" sequel---and would never director another English feature again) has served up a bracingly disturbing little ode to the noxious, infectious power of evil and the strength of the Dark. Bravo, Maestro Damiani, Bravo!

Let's sprinkle our Holy Water over the plot quickly: Amityville 2 is a prequel to the horrific events of ""The Amityville Horror"", in which the hapless Montellis play surrogates for the real-life DeFeos, snuffed out via high-powered rifle by their loving son ""Butch"" in 1974 in their idyllic 18th century manor on the Amityville river---complete with boathouse!

I wasn't expecting anything at all from Amityville 2, so imagine my surprise when I found a full-bore, absolutely relentless, tastily atmospheric little horror flick that practically exuded evil through its pores: ""Amityville 2: Possession"" is certainly not for the fainthearted. And let's have full disclosure up-front: whereas 1979's ""Amityville Horror"" was a fairly original take on the classic haunted house, #2 is a fairly obvious rip-off of ""The Exorcist"", whereas #3 (The Demon---in 3-D!) is a rip-off of Poultergeist.

With that in mind, ""Amityville 2"" comes across as ""The Exorcist"" if that film had been written by a serial killer. The House, funky evil-window eyes and all, gets right down to business, aided and abetted by Franco Da Giacomo's dark and stylish camera-work. Walls bleed, floor ooze black goop, closets stink, windows slam shut---the usual. A workman summoned to the cellar says ""there's dirt and gunk and slime and all kinds of stuff under there---I advise you guys to just leave it alone"". Funny how in horror movies the second most common mistake---second only to shouting ""hello? Hello, anyone there?""---is ignoring sound advice.

Second, unlike the relatively happy Lutzes, the Montelli clan is deranged and dysfunctional from the beginning: from shouting, oafish, leering patriarch Tony Montelli (the oafish, leering veteran character actor Burt Young, actually in his early forties at the time but looking all of a road-worn 59), the alternately shrieking and bawling wife Dolores (Rutanya Alda)who convincingly freaked me out; and the glowering Sonny Montelli (played with amazing presence and poise by the young Jack Magner, and who looked for all the world like Luke Skywalker), who wants to spend far too much quality time with lovely, innocent sister Patrica (Diane Franklin, precocious, quirky, and horribly naive). Daddy Montelli starts out by glowering and threatening his son, even in a good mood, so it's obvious the Monelli family is putty in the Evil House's hands. Does it help matters to add that said House is built over an Indian burial ground?

I've said ""Amityville 2"" is a blatant rip-off of ""The Exorcist"", and it is: but it sets the stage elegantly. It is brutal, actually very scary, boasts some stylish camera angles and a masterful handling of light and darkness woefully absent from the first outing, and its eager leap into incest just heightens he film's sleaziness and evil. Sadly, the last third of the film spends its time with guilt-ridden Father Adamsky (James Olson, who has solid acting chops) battling fitfully to save poor Sonny, at which point we get the obligatory green pea-soup vomit and nasty repartee. Really, if you've got dishes to do, you can leave at this point---the serious fun is over.

When all is said and done, ""Amityville 2"" is a sick, wicked, twisted wreck of a film, tied up in ribbons and stylish bows and sincerely, honestly terrifying at points. Yes it drags, in the end; and yes, it ransacks Blatty's far more successful ""Exorcist""---but I guarantee you it will give you nightmares.

After seeing this sequel, which is really a ""prequel"" to the original film, it's safe to say that you can stop after the first film because this one and the remaining films offer very little to watch or get excited about. This isn't saying much about the original either, because it too wasn't much of anything to begin with. This sequel, released in 1982, is more in touch, more or less, with the actual murders that took place in the infamous Long Island house on 112 Ocean Avenue on the early morning of November 13, 1974. It still exploits those tragic events into a supernatural haunted house story with it's facts turned around for entertainment value and a different family. Burt Young plays the overbearing and abusive matriarch of the family that consists of his wife and 4 kids. The oldest being Sonny(Jack Magner). It isn't long after the family moves into the house that strange things happen. In fact, they happen almost immediatley. Which was a problem with the first film. The James Brolin character got taken over so quickly, it was hard to connect with him because we didn't get enough time to know him. The same goes for Sonny, who is almost instantly changed once he moves in. The spirits and the voices drive Sonny over the edge, telling him to murder his family. His family are not very sympathetic and they don't earn your interest enough to care if they get wiped out or not. The family priest played by James Olson, gets in on the horror in the house and tries to help the family. The big action comes sooner than you would think, and the rest of the film turns into another Hollywood piece of mumbo jumbo that forgoes any kind of suspense or truthfulness that came in the film up to this point. It completely unravels and becomes a mess that seems as if it were just slapped together. It does have one harrowing scene when the son gets the dirty deed done on his family. That part was the only interesting and halfway creepy thing about this otherwise forgettable film. The acting isn't much better than the original, with the exception of Young as the brute father and Olson as the priest. The brother/sister action in the film is unsettling, but also a bit laughable. She has no problem with getting nude and posing and all this, instructed by her brother, but once she learns that he has some undergarments of hers, then hey!, she senses that something is odd. Really?!?!. The film is also kind of shocking in some ways because of some of the deaths that take place since it is unusual to see them in a horror movie. I won't say what it is though. The ""Amityville"" movies have been a questionable, and less than stellar affair right from the start. The original was not very good, and it didn't get any better with the unending amount of unneeded and uunwarranted sequels. Oh, and by the way, in case you were wondering, my title refers to an old Johnny Mathis tune. So, while this film has some things going for it that are a tad better than the original, like a faster pace, and a better priest, and that one harrowing set piece showcasing the murders, it still fails to come to the level of a film that was sub par to begin with. That kind of tells you everything right there.",1075766400,7,3407,4.496774193548387
733470,3,6303917410,"""Amityville II: The Possession"" is essentially a prequel to ""The Amityville Horror"" in that it tells why the home in the Long Island community was available for sale for that the Lutz family could move in and end up running fleeing for their lives.  This time it is the Montelli family that moves into the accursed house, which is not good because they are an unhappy family in the grand tradition of Tolstoy that is heading for trouble no matter where they live.  The main tension is between the father, Anthony (Burt Young), and his eldest song, Sonny (Jack Magner), and if it were not for the fact that anyone who saw the original movie knows what is going to happen at the end of this one, you might be wondering which one of these guys is going to lose it first.
Surprisingly, this 1982 film goes through a lot of the same things as the original, which is not surprising for a sequel but more so because there was never a notion that every time somebody moves into this house rooms are covered with flies, blood comes out in strange places, and unseen presences are running around making people feel uneasy.  In another move that makes sense only in terms of the movies rather than the ""history"" of the house, the unseen beings start covering the walls of the children's bedroom with evil pictures and phrases.  At this point the film convinces you that there is something really evil in that house, and it would be Anthony Montelli.  Even when the local priest (James Olson) comes by to bless the house and sees Anthony going after his family, he walks away (which would seem to be good advice with regards to this film).
On some levels this film is better than the original, but only in the sense that if there never had been an original this one might work better.  The flaw with the film version of ""The Amityville Horror"" was that whereas the novel told a ""true"" story in a rather documentary style, which was abandoned for cheesy horror film effects.  The simple idea of possession that was implied to be the reason the son went off one night and killed his family is now adorned with a whole host of tacky ""Exorcist"" like ideas.  The irony, as I understand it, is that the killing of this family was the one bit of the hoax that really was true.  The names are changed because this film would have been the target for a lawsuit otherwise. If director Damiano Damiani had stuck to the true story and forgot about all this other nonsense he would have had a better film.

Loosely based on the real-life 1974 DeFeo murders,this movie begins with the Montelli family moving into 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, and all hell breaks out. Blood gushes from water taps, a bedroom goes berserk in a poltergeist attack, the Mother is touched by a ghost in the basement and her son hears a demonic voice telling him to kill his family, and boy does he ever.
The exorcism at the movie's conclusion is every bit as frightening as the scenes from ""The exorcist"". Great cast, especially Jack Magner as the son. Whatever happened to him ? James Olson is good as the priest, Burt Young is very nasty as the bullying Montelli patriarch, and Diane Franklin as his daughter is beautiful (and she does a topless scene too.)

733555,1,6303917410,"This movie completely falls flat.......it's a prequel, based on ""actual events"" with names changed to protect the innocent.....good thing, because this family is scarier than the movie itself(bratty kids, incestual older siblings, wife beating, etc.) It's hard to care about these people and even harder to UNDERSTAND them....a little back story to the back story would've been nice.
This movie is also so bleak...totally dark and depressing.  I also find the incest scene to be very tacky....the scene plays out as a typical teen make-out love scene.  It's only in the next scene when the girl goes to confessional that she hated herself later(and that the devil made her brother do it).......this scene was badly handled and made me want to turn the tv off....
My big nitpick moment comes when the lead character is lying in bed with his sony walkman headset on.......yes this is a nitpick....but, uh, if the original took place in the mid-seventies...then this PREQUEL would be set at an earlier time with that(I'm not familiar with the ""real"" story that this is based on so forgive me).......I don't believe walkmans were around at that time.....but that's just something that has annoyed me for a long time about this movie.......

For those who don't know, this film is based loosely on the DeFeo murders in 1974. However, this film practically makes fun of it. It makes the family look like a bunch of dysfunctional louts. I figure if you were going to make a movie about a tragic event, you would at least have a little respect for the victims.

733557,3,6303917410,"First off, let me say that I don't think THE AMITYVILLE HORROR should've gotten any sequels, because it was a very strong film on its own.  But then, 1982 rolls around and someone suddenly gets an urge to ruin a good horror film by creating the unnecessary AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION.  It's a prequel to the first one, chronicling the events that occured when the original family, the DeFeos owned the infamous Long Island home, which I have been to myself.  I live in Bohemia, New York and Amityville is only about 20 minutes away.
But, I digress.  Instead of calling the family the DeFeos, they were called the Montellis.  The movie starts off pretty good, actually, but then, eventually, everything goes downhill.  It's not a good movie and I wouldn't buy it.  It's worth a rent though.",1059264000,,792,4.695652173913044
733558,3,6303917410,"Is this a great film? Hell no (pun intended). But I enjoyed it a whole lot more than its predecessor. Amityville II embodies the kind of over-the-top horror that thousands of lousy drive-in flicks have tried unsuccessfully to achieve.
This time around, there's no beating around the bush (burning or otherwise). The house is haunted-- VERY haunted. A tiny door in the kitchen leads down to the cellar, where evil spirits squirm in the cold, dripping muck. The DeFeo family-- consisting of an abusive father, frigid mother, two perfect young kids and two horny teenagers-- moves into the house, expecting to find a new stress-and-devil free lifestyle out in this homey small town community. Instead, they encounter an invisible evil that doesn't stop until the entire family has been defiled and murdered.
This film has tons of fun stuff, including the ""I'll be the famous photographer"" incest seduction scene, the devil-gets-the-kids-in-trouble scene, the devil-jumps-on-Ronnie's-stomach scene, and my personal favorite, the 'you know you want it, priest!' scene in which the demons pose as the sultry teenaged daughter and try to seduce the priest with flickering tongue and [a lot] makeup. Even if you don't respect this film, you have to love it, if you love horror.
It's my understanding that the soundtrack was originally written for 'The Exorcist,' but was rejected because it was too over the top. I guarantee that if you watch this film, you'll find yourself humming the theme music at all kinds of inappropriate times.

This film is supposedly based on the real-life murder of one big family who moved into the cursed Long Island house. However, in this movie, the family is portrayed in such a negative and ugly light that we the viewers are glad that they get killed by the possessed teenage son. Burt Young overacts to the nth degree as the evil patriarch of the family, beating and yelling at his youngest children, and the possessed son seduces his teenage sister in one particularly exploitative sequence. The finale is a painful rip-off of ""The Exorcist"" [in fact, the whole movie is!]. The first ""Amityville"" film was okay, but this ""prequel"" is simply painful. I will NEVER watch the rest of the series, since the sequels may be even worse than this one.",1048636800,3,880,4.758169934640523

But any die-hard Amityville fan such as me, should without a doubt, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. some night, take this movie, put it in the VCR, turn off all the lights, sit down, and get ready for Amityville 2:The Possession. For starters, it's the exact same house used in the original Amityville movie(with those same spooky, creepy third floor windows on the sides of the house). That's almost reason enough to check this movie out. But you also get to watch a few creepy, paranormal demonic scenes that take place in the early, early morning hours inside the house, such as in the first one. The beginning of the movie isn't the most exciting, but-keep watching!! The movie gradually builds and builds and there are a couple of creepy, scary as hell scenes that take place in the basement of the house!! I won't give away what happens in the last 15 minutes of the movie, but anyone who is a die-hard fan of the Amityville house(like me), will watch the last 15 minutes over and over again when you see some of the creepy and I do mean CREEPY scenes taking place in the house!!! You will feel some of those same chills going through your spine that you saw watching some of the other scenes from the first Amityville movie!! Not to get off the subject, but who could forget the ""marching drums"" that George Lutz heard coming from his...DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM(!!!!!!!) in that first movie at 3:15 a.m. no less!! The mother in this movie is very good at scaring and creeping you out when she starts getting chills in the house because of how scared she makes herself look. The person who did the musical score in this movie I THINK is the same person who did the musical score for the original Amityville, and whether that is the case or not, the music is very, very spooky and creepy too.

733562,5,6303917410,"I know that many horror fans hold this movie in low regard, but I found it gritty, disturbing, and genuinely scary.  It's not perfect, but I think it deserves five stars.  For me, the whole fact or fiction debate is unimportant; I am judging this movie solely on its own merits.  The makers of the film may have had a limited budget, but they doggedly pulled out all of the stops; maybe they went overboard once or twice, but that is quite OK with me, given what they did achieve.  Naturally, the house itself with its baleful eye-like windows, does much to set the table for a feast of fright, but the makers were not content to depend on the house alone.  The point-of-view shots from the viewpoint of the evil essence work wonderfully; the use of unusual, oddly-angled perspectives was highly effective; and the supernatural manifestations were never allowed to overshadow the real story of the family's tragedy.  The acting was not particularly accomplished in general, with the mother in particular guilty of overacting, but Jack Magner as Sonny and Diane Franklin as Patricia give outstanding performances in very different roles.  Sonny's evolution from wholesome yet troubled young man to demonic mass murderer is a little rushed and was necessarily trying both physically and mentally on the young actor, but Magner keeps this movie from becoming wholly unbelievable and laughable.  Franklin also deserves much credit for her portrayal of the wholesome yet haunted younger sister of Sonny; she alone invites sympathy from the viewer and makes the events of the fateful night of horror truly disturbing.
Apparently, the makeup artists for this picture were told to just go crazy.  For the most part, the special effects are very good, although the extent of physical transformations we witness in Sonny are probably somewhat excessive.  This only becomes problematic toward the exorcism scenes at the end.  The music is also an important and effective part of this movie experience, although at times it reminded me of Star Trek music.
Much has been made of the incest storyline, but I feel it is important to note that there is no graphic exploitation of this controversial theme.  In fact, that aspect of the movie makes the tragedy all the more dramatic and compelling.  The key to this movie's winning me over was the concentration on family issues; to call this family dysfunctional is perhaps an understatement.  The gore is there at times, but it is not the focus of the storyline-if anything, it takes away from rather than adds to the impact of the film on the viewer.  It is also unfortunate but perfectly understandable that this film is compared so closely to The Exorcist.  Certainly, the latter parts of the movie are weaker than the first half, and it is pretty obvious that the whole exorcism storyline reflected an attempt by the filmmakers to somewhat selfishly usurp the notoriety of The Exorcist.  There are, however, many differences between this film and The Exorcist, and taken on its own merits I found the relevant scenes powerful and effective.  I agree that the movie goes downhill somewhat after the pivotal murders actually take place, but I can honestly say that the first hour of this movie represents some of the most creepiest, spine-tingling moments in the annals of cinematic horror.",1033516800,16,3326,4.951438848920863

733625,1,6303917410,"I saw this movie because it featured one of my favorite actresses from the early '80s -- the lovely Diane Franklin who is probably best known for a better role in a better movie, Better Off Dead.  Here, Franklin is basically the only sympathetic character as she plays the sweetly virginal younger sister of a teenager who is eventually possessed by Satan and goes on a killing rampage in the house that would later become the setting of the Amityville Horror.  Anyway, as part of that whole possession deal, older brother decides to have an incestous relationship with younger sister and the fact that Franklin, an actress who deserved better, is so shamelessly exploited only serves to make this film even more sickening to sit through.  This is the most loathsome type of horror film -- i.e., the type of film that exists only to introduce a group of characters so that the audience can then get the thrill of watching them sadistically killed off.  That takes place in the first half of the film.  The second half is a blatant rip-off of the Exorcist and isn't any better.  Few other movie genres have the potential power of the horror film and a film like Amityville II serves only to remind us how great these films can be when done with some measure of talent and thought (the original Halloween, the Exorcist, the original Haunting of Hill House, and a few others come to immediate mind).  Still, anyone who enjoys watching little children graphically murdered and innocent girls raped by their brothers should find plenty to enjoy in this film.

733627,3,6303917410,"After his family movies into a haunted house a young man becomes demonically possessed, seduces his sister, and then kills his entire family. A kindly, guilt plagued priest attempts an exorcism to save the boy's soul, but the results are suspect. Based in part on the book Murder in Amityville by Hans Holzer Amityville 2: The Possession also, sadly, borrows quite heavily from The Exorcist, which cripples its fact based claims. More on that later. First let's talk about the good points, of which there are some. The movie is well photographed and scored (I am no musical expert but it sounds like Lalo Schifrin reversed the notes from the theme of the first Amityville for this film, a nice little touch that makes it sound similiar but slightly off key) and the production values are nice. The special effects are also quite good and stand up well today, not bad for a movie nearly twenty years old. And there is a some good acting (notably from Diane Franklin as the incest tortured sister) to be found amongst all the screaming and growling.
Now for the bad, of which there is a lot. First and most important is that this film is complete fiction. The names were not changed to protect the innocent but to avoid litagation (as in defamation of character, etc.). Although the story is supposed to be a prequel (the events of the first Amityville story occured in late December 1975 and early January 1976) the movie's props and costume design is entirely eighties (Walkmans were not around in 1974). The acting is melodramatic and hamfisted (Rutanya Alda is especially embarrassing to watch). Even worst, all the facts regarding the actual murders are wrong. The DeFeos were killed in their beds, not while running around the house screaming. Gruesome exploitation of real life tragedy is what this movie is all about, not the supernatural. It should also be pointed out that everything after the murders is a standard Exorcist rip-off and in no way whatsoever describes real events following the murders of the DeFeo family at 112 Ocean Avenue in 1974.
I must say that I do like Amityville 2: The Possession as a cheesy movie, it is far from boring and has a fair share of creepy moments (best are the gliding, stalking Demon's POV shots). But the viewer has to remember that, in the end, this all Hollywood make believe and exploitation and in no way should be considered a true story.

The family is troubled to begin with (physical and emotional abuse, incest, and so on) and before long Sonny snaps and murders his family with a shotgun.  Still with me?  Okay.  The rest of the film details how the priest tries to release Sonny from his demonic possession.  The second half shamelessly rips off ""The Exorcist"", most likely to pad the running time after the murders.

733632,5,6303917410,"One of the BEST horror films EVER! If not, 'THE' best.
The film portrays TRUE events that happened in a real town called Amityville, Long Island NY in 1975.
""In a middle class, sleepy little town, a boy named Ronald  Defeo, 'out of the blue', shoots to death all 6 members of his entire  family in their sleep. The house is only a couple of meters away from the  houses next door, and yet no shots were heard. The gun used was a  high-powered rifle! The boy is arrested and sentenced to life. End of  story.
Until, 1 year later the Lutz family moves into the house (the man  uncannily looks very much like the murderer), only to move out 28 days  later claiming that the house is (demonically) haunted.
The Lutz's story  became worldwide news, and completely overshadowed the DeFeo story. The  Lutz's wrote a book called 'The Amityville Horror' about their ordeal, then  a film was made, based on the book, also called 'The Amityville  Horror'.""
This is a sequel to the Lutz's 'The Amityville Horror',  but actually tells the story the Defeo's.
The movie offers a different  perspective from the conventional facts. In the movie, shortly after the  family moves in, subtle supernatural things start to happen. This, though,  leads the father to turn violent, and domestic troubly start. A priest is  asked to bless the house, but when he comes he soon wishes that he hadn't.  One dark night the eldest boy, when in The house all alone, is violently  possessed by something very evil. Over a period of time the boys attitude  and appearance start to change for the worse, he then has incest with his  sister, and finally he murders his entire family.
The cinematography in  this film is in a class of it's own. A true feat that has set the  standards, which no other horror film has managed; (with the exception of  the original, 'The Amityville Horror', and 'The Exorcist'). The movie is  well made in every respect and the acting in outstanding.
The house  itself, that the movie was filmed in, is enough to give you creeps. It's  the second most spookiest house I've seen; the original house is The  spookiest.
The achievement is the atmosphere and vibe that this movie  manages to produce- something uncannily REAL...

The first third of this movie is completely insane, one of the most over-the-top things I've ever seen.  It all gets started immediately, and it's not just the house, the family is completely insane.  Burt Young, the dad, is abusing the children and his wife within the first few minutes, things are flying off the walls, etc., all before they have had even a single night in the house.  Then Burt Young gets even worse and things get truly sordid.  And oh my god the relationship between the brother and sister!  Later on Things Happen, but the first scene between them is insane.  This movie is just insane and sordid.  And the camerawork is really creative and flamboyant also.

Then the second third it dramatically slows down when the boy becomes possessed, but it's still interesting.  Then it slows WAY down after the murders happen.  Then it picks up again a little bit at the end.

The plotting of the movie is truly bizarre; it is almost constructed in reverse.  The climax happens first, and then the slow build up.

I think the reason people respond negatively to this movie is the following.  The first half is completely insane.  If it had maintained that level, this would be a very famous horror movie.  But then the second half is really slow COMPARED to the first half.  My wife and I had opposite reactions to this.  For me, the first half was so insane I didn't even really care what happened in the second half because we'd already gotten the first (like how a roller coaster's first hill is always the best--you're not going to complain about the end of the ride because it sucked compared to the first).  For my wife, she I think was MORE let down than she would have been.  I am quite sure if the whole movie had just been an exorcist rip-off she would have liked it, but after the first half, the second half seems really bland.

So, if you find yourself bored by the second half, you can probably just turn it off, but do not deprive yourself of the sordid insanity of the first half.",1492387200,3,2164,4.464285714285714
