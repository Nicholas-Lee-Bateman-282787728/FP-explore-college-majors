2864117,5,B000RE94M4,"I have not done a lot of yoga before, but now I'm hooked.

This DVD is fantastic. It has two levels of workouts (and each level has a few workouts) - one level is for beginners and one has some more challenging poses once you are comfortable with the first level.

There is also a third section (again with a few workouts) that incorporates weights and/or a resistance band into the workout.

Not only have I lost some weight and am closer to touching my toes easily, but I have really toned up from this DVD. I would have called this DVD, ""Yoga for Getting in Shape"" Highly recommended.",1191542400,305,587,4.36697247706422
2864118,5,B000RE94M4,"I thought this DVD was very innovative and challenging. I have a few yoga DVDs, some from this company, and I thought this was one of the better presentations of yoga I have seen. Great instruction and lots of details for the beginner. There is a whole other section that uses props like light handweights and a resistance band to intensify the yoga postures and really work up a sweat. Highly recommended.",1189296000,47,406,4.652777777777778
2864119,5,B000RE94M4,I absolutely love this video.  It is definitely for beginners to the yoga routine.  The background scenery and music is soothing and the instructor is very easy to follow and shows the moves so you are doing them correctly.  Even though the voice is overlayed onto the movements her voice is not annoying and is actually quite soothing.  Can't wait to get good enough for the next leve.,1183939200,28,386,4.632352941176471
2864120,5,B000RE94M4,"Having done yoga both with videos and in a class, I found this video to be a step above most other yoga videos. It is arranged in three sections, each having multiple workouts.  The first section is designed for beginners, with one section teaching a basic set of poses, and two sections with flow-style practices of varying length.  That is, the poses flow from one to the next for continuous, slow movement.  The pacing is great - slow enough to allow good form in each pose, but fast enough to allow you to move along with the breath, as you breath in and out.  However, it is clearly not ""remedial,"" and includes poses requiring some flexibility, balance, and strength (e.g., downward-facing dog with one leg raised, as well as some balancing poses). If someone lacks flexibility or strength, I'd definitely recommend starting instead with ""Essential Yoga for Inflexible People,"" which a friend tells me is perfect for beginners.  The second section (the one I use the most) is a little more challenging and also has several different flow-style practices that vary in focus (arms, legs, total body) and length.  It's surprising how much your heart gets beating and you really feel your muscles working.  They are the ideal every-day workout.  The third section is an interesting twist - yoga along with light weights or a resistance band to get even more strength training work.  Again, there are several different practices that vary in focus and length. Very clever and fun.  The instructions on how to work in each pose are extremely well done.  Usually, the biggest downside to learning yoga from a video rather than a well-conducted class is that you can't get individualized instruction, and so you can learn the poses incorrectly and not get the full benefit of the practice.  However, the instruction is so well-done that I found this video to instead help me refine and improve my use of the various poses.  Finally, the filming is simply beautiful, with a gorgeous ocean landscape.  This is quickly becoming my favorite yoga video!",1183420800,885,2046,4.892753623188406
2864121,5,B000RE94M4,"I love this DVD for many reasons.. 1 is because it is just plain beautiful to watch and to listen to.  I love hearing the sound of the ocean in the background -- It is so much better than the awful music that you sometimes hear in these videos.
I also really enjoy the flowing aspect of the video.  So many of the yoga videos I've seen make you stop and start your workout...They show you one pose and then they stop to talk about it.  I find this annoying because  if you want a continuous practice, you have to fast forward through the explanations.  Maggie Rhoades incorporates the  explanations into the poses, for example, while you're holding downward facing dog for 5 full breaths, she talks about the benefits of the pose, moving more fully into the pose, etc.
I am a beginning yoga student so some of the dvd was too advanced for me but I tried the more challenging vinyasas nonetheless and will keep practicing so that one day I'll be able to do them.
Maggie's cueing is excellent.  You can follow along even if you're not watching the dvd.  This is very helpful as you move through the poses.
I do wish there were a more specific menu so I could pick my practice easier.  The items listed on the menu are very general.
I would definitely recommend this dvd.",1183420800,51,1268,4.384615384615385

Upper body, lower body, full body, with bands and weights, without. Right now we're just using the beginner routines -- which we are both finding doable, despite my husband's (suprinsing, LOL) lack of flexibility. We are both in decent shape, though. I don't know how some who is really a beginner would find them. If they worked to their own level, I think OK.

One thing that annoys me about every weightloss Yoga DVD I have owned is that they are not made for overweight people even if they claim to help in weightloss. Jillian Michael's yoga meltdown is the worst of them. The instructors very likely have never been overweight or given much thought to how much more difficult it is to move if you carry your extra fat in your torso. If you are an apple shape body type that needs to lose weight and you really want to try yoga I recommend yoga journal's youtube page for free short videos, try the 10 minute workouts and even the individual poses for your level. It can give you a really good idea of where your body is strong and where it is weak and what types of poses are a challenge for your flexibility level or body type. I found it very helpful and realized my hipflexors and glutes were really tight so I bought; ""Beginner's Yoga for Stress relief by gaiam"" There is a short 30 minute routine and it opened up the tightness in my hips and glutes and now I am able to do intermediate and advanced yoga because I was able to start correcting the imbalances in my body.",1441584000,3,1267,4.261410788381743

I have had other yoga DVDs before and always enjoyed them and would do regularly. My last DVD got damaged and I was hoping to find a better one. One that would be more geared toward fitness and building strength. I would be very surprised if these routines provide any weight loss benefit.

2864210,5,B000RE94M4,"I've never done yoga prior to this and I'd say I was relatively out of shape when I got it. That being said, the first time I did a routine i was cussing at the lady on the tv because the poses were so crazy and foreign to me. But the next day I was sore all over from working muscles that I tend to neglect at the gym. I am still doing the beginner routines but I am totally in love with how toned and tight my body has become since starting this. There has been a noticeable reduction in my waistline, thighs and arms. It gets you sweating, and most importantly it motivates me to keep moving throughout the day and I honestly can't wait to get home and do more. It's funny in the beginning, laughing at myself trying to balance and transition smoothly between poses, and then really rewarding when I finally master a pose. It's been great for my confidence and overall body image. I feel stronger and more in tune with myself than ever before. I think that the first time I tried it, I would have agreed with the folks who say it is too hard for beginners, but after the second and third time I did it I realized it boils down to familiarity and practice.",1437004800,12,1158,4.174107142857143

It is good in that the instructor gives good direction and starts the DVD off with easier material to ease you into things.  They are also short enough that they are not overwhelming.

First off - her voice is extremely shrewd. I feel like she's just an irritable woman who is only teaching me because she absolutely has to.

In the other DVDs, the instructors have gone over the importance of breath, and setting a firm foundation with your legs and feet. She does not go over any of this.

The way she explains the poses are confusing, so I find I am having to watch her 80% of the time to figure out what we're doing next.

They do get easier as you do them more often, but you should be warned that this will NOT be easy for the first few weeks.  I was already pretty flexible, active and not obese, and I had a difficult time holding many of the poses.  And many of them are just plain uncomfortable.

2864401,1,B000RE94M4,"Those who have said ""This is great for beginners"" are NOT beginners themselves.  Experienced yogi should not write reviews on beginner products, because it's likely they don't remember what it's like to be a beginner.

There are two essential things in the title of this product that should define it:  (a) 'Beginners' and (b) 'For Weight Loss'.  The makers of this video need to assume two very important things of their audience:  that they are both inflexible beginners to yoga, and that they are overweight.  I am both of these things, and I wanted to get a video to try out a beginner routine at my own pace before I sign up for a class.

The first routine, which is claimed to be designed as a warmup for beginners, involves standing straight, bending double to the floor, shifting into a lunge, then into a triangular bridgeup and then into a pushup.  The routine moves so fast that unless you understand the moves being described (or have watched the video enough times to memorize it), you won't be able to make the movements in time to keep up with her.

The next routine, entitled ""Getting Started"", involves standing up straight, raising the arms, reaching down and bending double to touch the floor, then 'jumping' back into a pushup pose and lowering into a pushup until only your hands, toes and forehead touch the floor before then pushing backwards with your hips until you're doing a forward bridge (I think it's called a 'downward dog' in Yoga).  I bought this to start with a gentle, beginner's routine that is tempered for overweight people looking to lose weight.  I don't know anyone overweight who is new to yoga who can 'jump' into a pushup pose.

Essentially this video is a collection of unrelated routines made for different videos, compiled here to serve as an advertisement for their other DVDs - they plug the DVD the routine came from at the end of each routine, and each routine seems to end rather abruptly as though it were just a clip.

This video is good to test out other videos in the series and see if you like them.  And if you're maybe 20 pounds overweight and have at least had a few (maybe 10-12) yoga lessons then you would likely find this an ideal starting point.  But this is NOT a DVD for complete beginners unless you're already in very good shape, and it's definitely not a DVD for someone who might be 50+ pounds overweight.

Breakdown of the stars:
-2 stars for not being a true product, but rather a collection of previews
-2 stars for not being what it says it is;  it is neither designed for beginners, nor designed for someone overweight
-1 star for the strange, wooden smile and awkward voiceover that doesn't describe things in a manner that's easy to visualize
+1 star for being well-made, with nice locations and good sound quality",1359417600,313,2792,4.619433198380567

2864411,3,B000RE94M4,"I like this video quite a lot. However, there are two serious problems with it.

The first is that the model demonstrating the poses has TERRIBLE posture. She hyper-extends her pelvis in the worst way, and her upper body is very, very congested, especially about the shoulder girdle. I majored in dance in college, and this model would never have gotten away with that posture there. I can't believe someone demonstrating yoga is so unaware of her own body. DO NOT copy her posture or you will suffer for it later.

The second is that I would not at all consider this a beginners' video. Some of the stuff is okay, like the Sun Salutation with the Chair. It would make a good starting place for someone who has never done yoga before. But other things are not for beginners at all. Going directly into a half-lotus tree pose, for example. I can't even do that, and I've been doing yoga for years. And the video gives no alternatives to the poses. They go directly into the most extreme example of a stretch, and do not propose any modifications for people who may not be able to get there. I think this might lead people to try things they aren't ready for, because they think it's the only proper way to do it.

So, if you've done yoga before and know what you're about, this is a good video. I wouldn't recommend it for a true beginner, though.",1354060800,5,1346,4.419354838709677

I have not been doing yoga for that long, maybe two or three months. I take classes at my gym. I just found this to be very uninspiring and not very challenging. Like I said before if you are brand new to yoga and want to try it, this would be a good start to learn the basics. There were a lot of downward dog and cobra poses. I think the most challenging thing it went to was Warrior 1 & 2 poses. Some might like this dvd and its simplicity but it is not for me unfortunately.",1351036800,,639,3.923076923076923

Then move on from there, and make sure to listen to the instructions and modifications through out to do what is comfortable for you.  For instance, after awhile in later exercises, she mentioned bringing your feet or legs just as far as you can move them or where you feel comfortable without feeling like you are straining, then move further on from there as you feel you can do.

The instructor is great, very good directions throughout the routines and while you're holding a pose for a number of breathes, she gives you details about the pose.

Big tip for anyone getting this DVD - WATCH THE INTERVIEW before you try any of the workouts. In the interview she talks about yoga in general, emphasizes that there is no benefit in yoga to work into pain or discomfort and gives suggestions on modifying poses or skipping them if you need to.

 Like with most things, if you're new to yoga, don't expect to look like she does doing the poses right away. Do what you can and keep at it and you'll get there.  Once you get comfortable with the routines and poses, and want more of a challenge, the section with bands and weights will give you a great workout.",1319673600,4,953,4.511627906976744

The third part with the weights and bands is alot of fun and really has helped me tone up.  I like the fact that I can move between things based on how I feel on any day, sometimes doing the longer more advanced things and sometimes the easier things.

I think a review should be allowed positive or negative to get all aspects of the yoga practice from different perspectives.

This yoga is first and foremost not for beginners and then the flow is not good at all. She does not have sections to calm yourself adequately after strenuous circular vinyasas and spends too much time in downward dog than necessary. I do not think most people will have the upper body strength to hold downwards dog for that long. I like the idea of growing into it but this is there in the beginners sequence also.

there is no mind body aspect of yoga at all , it feels like a pilates vedios, don't get me wrong she does give cues for breathing but that is almost it. For some reason vinyasa yogis forget that flows need to be balanced not just right and left body but vigourous and restorative too. if it is just vigourous then there is imbalance.

The other problem i have with this dvd is she doesnt understand the body of an overweight person doing this yoga to loose weight. She doesnt give modifications nor does she acknowledge that starting slow is good. For all these reasons and for the fact that this is marketed as a YOGA dvd for peope wanting to LOSE WEIGHT and to add for BEGINNERS it fell quiet short.",1318809600,44,1408,4.403846153846154

I've purchased a number of videos in the past where the directions were unclear and the standard poses were embellished to make the workout more ""interesting.""  As a personal preference, I like to be led through the sun salutations and a number of added poses.  For comparison, I love Rodney Yee's DVDs and really dislike Shiva Rea's.  I've done many yoga classes in various studios, so I'm not a beginner, but I don't practice regularly and definitely am not super flexible, either.  I like this video because the poses are clearly explained, and it moves at a nice pace.  The poses are held for a number of breaths, long enough to get a really good stretch, but not so long that it gets boring.  There are a variety of workouts, so you can pick and choose what you can fit in your day.  The 50 minute program is my favorite because it feels like a workout, but the 30 minute gives a good stretch as well.  I haven't tried any of the workouts that use the stretch band yet, because the standard workouts are enough for me so far.  An advanced yoga practitioner would most likely be bored with this DVD, but I found it perfect.  Music is background and not obtrusive or annoying.

The first section has routines that at a good pace and are challenging enough that you feel you worked, but not so hard that a beginner couldn't do them.  The second section increase the challenge a little.  And the third adds weights and bands to really target and tone.",1316563200,,564,4.375

So, if a DVD leaves me feeling better throughout the day, that's the real test for me and what will keep me coming back for more.  So far I've not been disappointed, what I find really refreshing about this DVD is that I start sweating almost immediately, and continue sweating through the whole workout.  I also really like the way this DVD is laid out, there are so many plausible workouts for anyone to do, it doesn't have to be the same way twice.  As for the weight loss aspect, I've only been using this for a few days so I can't attest to its benefits, but I can tell that my inner thighs and legs especially are getting a really good workout because I'm SORE afterward.  I'm not a yoga expert, but I am a yoga DVD expert (on merit of having purchased/used so many) - this one is an excellent value.",1314403200,9,1092,4.205741626794258

I usually go to classes at my gym (which I enjoy most), but since I can't always go at the times the classes are offered, I decided to buy a dvd for home use.

I purchased this dvd based on great reviews, and I have been nothing but disappointed so far. I am new to yoga and I do find some of the work outs challenging, so it's not a total loss for me. That being said, my main disappointment stems from the fact that it advertises to be ""12+ routines,"" yet it is basically a bunch of sun salutations fit into different workout lengths. It is literally about 3 or 4 pose sequences that she has recorded and strung together into different time frames. Also, there are several parts that I have noticed where she says the incorrect leg/arm/side, because its just her voice dubbed over the taped pose sequences. She's not actually talking or interacting at all in the video.

I haven't used the weights and resistance band exercises yet, so I am hoping these will be more beneficial. This is the first yoga dvd I have purchased, so I wish I could recommend something better but I can't. This one certainly isn't for me though.",1314316800,4,1307,4.419087136929461

I tend to do each workout several times and when I feel very comfortable with it I move onto the next level. As I have progressed through the levels my strength and balance has gotten much better and I  hold poses with poise. After having it for two months, I am just now beginning to explore the advanced section.

She is very good about slowly taking you through poses and explaining them to you, and once you know the routine you can speed up to your own pace.

By the time I got the hang of the flow, and knew what she wanted me to do, the more I followed the instructions, the more I experienced pain in the arches of my feet and my ankles.

Being a beginner, I went straight for the introductory segments.  The first segment is a short sun salutation done with a chair.  It was okay, I suppose, but it didn't do much for me.

Then there's a slightly longer segment of sitting poses.  I have trouble with my knees, so I can't kneel or move around from a kneeling position, so that segment is out.

The next segment is a twenty minute segment that moves quickly into downward dog position and ... pretty much stays there.  There are slight variations as far as what muscles you're supposed to be focusing on and tensing and relaxing, but there's not a lot of movement.  Several minutes into it I was overjoyed when we moved to a standing position, but then we went right back to downward dog.  There's only so long I can stay in downward dog.  I don't find it soothing in any way, my arms and legs start to tremble and the blood rushes to my head.

So then I tried the thirty minute segment and again, it goes right into downward dog.  Beyond annoyed, I fast forwarded through the segment and it appears to be another repeat of variations on downward dog.  Ack!

If this video is for beginners, I don't want to see an advanced video.  Also, I'm utterly lost as to how this video is supposed to promote weight loss.

Needless to say, I didn't even attempt the more advanced segments.  This is not at all what I thought yoga was and this was definitely not for me.  I got a tai chi video at the same time (A.M./P.M. workouts with Scott Cole) and that is definitely more my style.

2864494,4,B000RE94M4,"I am an amateur ballroom dancer and have been working out regularly (cardio and weights) for most of my life. Recently, I had to give up running because the high-impact was causing me excessive lower back and neck pain. I was seeking a low-impact way to still achieve cardiovascular fitness, but also help me gain more flexibility and strength in muscles that aren't recruited in running (but may be helpful in dancing). I figured an introductory DVD in yoga would be a good place to start, although my past experiences with yoga (Bikram, or ""hot yoga"") weren't entirely pleasant (I got very dizzy and nauseous, and the continuous up-and-down poses didn't help)...and, I always poo-poo'ed the ability of yoga to actually be much of a vigorous workout, especially one intended to help with weight loss or weight maintenance. The first time I tried this DVD, I thought it was rather hokey, got dizzy from doing the downward-facing dog positions that is used so much, and figured that yoga really wasn't for me at all. I then stashed this DVD away for several months, feeling sorry I had wasted my money on it. However, I saw one of the professional dancers at the ballroom studio who had the most amazing dancer's body, and I asked her partner how she maintained it at such a lean and lithe form; he responded that she did a lot of core work (I supposed that meant Pilates, though, not yoga). I actually then ordered a ""Pilates for Dummies"" DVD, but while waiting for it to arrive, I pulled out and dusted off this DVD, figuring I'd give it another go just to see if I might respond to it more favorably (plus, my hour-long early morning treadmill workouts were getting rather boring). Surprisingly, making a conscientious and sincere effort to take yoga seriously was all it took to help me enjoy and appreciate this DVD much more than I did the first time. It is essentially still a beginner's yoga DVD, and I've tried pretty much all of the extended workouts (those greater than 30 minutes), including the ones using weights and resistance band incorporated into yoga. Though it isn't the type of heart-pumping, sweating-bullets sort of workout you'd expect from a true cardio workout, it does integrate stretching, balance, strength, calisthenics, and coordination. I've used this DVD consistently for the past 2 weeks so far, and now it is becoming a bit easy for me...however, this doesn't discount its effectiveness as a good beginner's introduction to yoga (especially for a beginner like me, with a rather disdainful initial view of yoga!).

I am already exploring other more advanced yoga DVD offerings, all because I rather enjoyed the different type of conditioning yoga is offering to my workouts (and my, ahem, aging body and joints). I think the balance training it teaches will help with my dancing, and combining yoga with Pilates will benefit the dancing as well by making me more flexible and my core stronger. Maggie Rhoades (the instructor in this video) has a very non-pretentious, open, down-to-earth simple and sincere demeanor in her voicing of the movements, and the fact that she DOES NOT look like every other ""fitness queen"" (i.e. fake silicone breasts, impossibly thin ""Barbie"" proportions, self-indulgently chirpy ""motivational"" attitude, and muscles so ripped it looks like she's been taking a combination of ephedrine and diuretics weeks before the shoot) makes it a much less intimidating learning experience. The scenery is also quite nice, I must admit, and the soft music in the background is not distracting at all (though it is used in all the workouts and gets to be predictable, though this is hardly a problem). Some of the movements are a bit repetitive, especially during the full-body flow vinyasas, but I guess that's how yoga is, especially at a beginner's level where more advanced movements have yet to be learned and mastered. I will keep this one as a good novice reference on yoga, or when I want just a slower and more relaxing workout in general.",1269129600,4,3998,4.879411764705883

Then, the person in the video doing the routines isn't even the instructor/person talking which I thought was lame for some reason. And this video was just all over the place. It had so many levels to choose from but they all ended up being the same poses - I didn't get it.

I had only done one class of yoga before, and  wanted to start practicing on my own at home, as it was much easier to fit into my schedule.

I weighed 130 lbs, and wanted to lose a little weight and mainly tone my body. By practicing 4-7 days a week (just 20-30 mn and 60 mn once a week), I have lost 6 lbs within 2 weeks and have seen spectacular results: my thighs have significantly reduced in size, as well as my buttocks. It has shaped my body in no time. I had a car accident about two years ago, and have had higher back pain since then. The pain has well reduced and I can feel I am sitting up straighter, and fell much better with my body.

The DVD is well done as it has 3 different chapters that enables to evolve in your practice. However, I was a little disappointed when moving to the ""As you progress"" chapter, as there were no new poses to learn from. There are just 3 (challenging) flows with the same positions learned before.

I have recommended this DVD to all of my friends, as I think it is perfect for a beginner. I am now looking for another DVD (still for weight loss) but it seems to be pretty difficult!

The sections with weights and bands are great and you will feel like you've had a workout. I'm feeling muscles I didn't know I had. The yoga poses with these added props really do hit parts of your body that you aren't going to get with any other exercise.

I often find myself using the ""weights and resistance"" programs without the additional equipment just because I like the poses and time limits in that section.

The Getting Started section is an assortment of routines to start you out with.  Good selection and variety of poses. As You Progress continues on with further routines while the ending section adds some very nice extras to the mix - weights and bands for a good variation.

The instructor is very clear and and explains the poses step by step throughout the routines, when to breath, where and when to move your arms and other advice along the same lines.  I enjoyed the Sun Salutations and with a little work and time I was able to improve and stretch further so I know I am making progress.

2864551,2,B000RE94M4,"I guess I'm in the minority but I do not like this DVD at all.  I've done several of the workouts and viewed all of them.  All of the workouts are basically just Sun Salutations and standing poses rearranged to fit different time frames.  Some workouts have weights and bands added to them.

The main thing that bugs me about this DVD is the sterile technicality of it.  It was very, ""Do this, then do that, now do this..."" etc.  There was no emphasis on breath, no time for centering yourself for a minute or so before your workout.  The instructor's voice was not very relaxing to listen to either.  There was very faint hint of music in the background.  I like music during my yoga workouts so it was almost a tease to me.

I've done quite a few Yoga DVD's where I sweat buckets but they still have the relaxing meditative quality, the focus on breath, and they can still be a very demanding workout without being so sterile and technical.  I prefer a more meditative Vinyasa Flow style workout, I guess.  While this DVD definitely has some very challenging workouts, it lacks the mind-body emphasis that makes Yoga unique. Otherwise why not just do Pilate's or aerobics?

It just wasn't for me but if you prefer a ""no nonsense"" purely physical approach to Yoga you might like it.  I'd still suggest you do some stretching though before you start this DVD as you will be going right into demanding poses like Chaturanga (the yoga push-up) within a minute or so of starting.  Also you should be familiar with Yoga's ujaii (sp?) breathing first as this DVD does not give any information on the very essence of what makes a workout ""Yoga"".  Otherwise you might as well just be doing any random body postures, twists, or stretches.

I can't personally recommend this DVD because of my issues with it but if the above gripes are not important to you you may like this DVD.",1218499200,215,1870,4.517857142857143

It goes through all the basics that will be helpful as you advance with the video.
 It also really helps to listen. The narrator says what is the next step well before the person in the video actually does it so it kind of prepares you.

This helped me increase my flexibility and made the more challenging sections but easy to pick up on.

The other levels add just the right amount of challenge.  All along the instructor is encouraging and provides details on all the positioning needed.  Great DVD.",1214092800,5,636,4.745454545454545

Camera action: feels a bit amateurish. Eg. Zoom too much into the chest and then zoom out again. Sometimes you see more of the sky than the person. I want to see how a correct pose look like but sometimes they switch the camera to an angle which doesn't show the full picture of the pose. I wish they would just leave the camera alone.

Quality of the film: a bit VHS-like. This is my 3rd yoga dvd and it just doesn't have the same quality as my other 2 by different instructors.

Beginning with an excellent introduction and a highly informative overview of yoga's purpose, goals, and methods -explaining how yoga can complement everything we do in life - Miss Rhoades takes the viewer on a challenging and highly instructive tour, offering routines for beginners, explaining and of course demonstrating in a step-by-step manner, many basic poses.  She not only explains how to do each pose but she tells us the benefits of each.  This is not a video to follow from start to finish (because it contains so much), but is probably more suited to a viewer finding routines that suit his or her level, interest, and ability.  It does presuppose a certain familiarity with yoga poses and techniques, although a complete novice could start just with her basics and then build from there.  There is really so much on this very long tape - it even includes the use of props - that it is well worth the reasonable price.  I especially appreciated Ms. Rhoades' ""Interview"" advice in which she suggests that viewers make yoga part of their lives and to ""have fun"" doing it.

The next level is a bit more challenging and the last section uses weights and bands to help supplement the yoga workout.
