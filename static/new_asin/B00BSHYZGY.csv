8573327,1,B00BSHYZGY,"I seldom take the time to write about a movie that in my view is a waste of time, but this movie is not only a waste of time it is a waste of talent. The director and author has done some fine work and Brad Hollowell is a fine actor whose talent is lost in the mire of this film. A wondering plot line can be challenging fun but this one wonders right out of sight. I urge you to save your time and money for something better. I wish someone had warned me.",1377475200,7,456,3.8105263157894735
8573328,3,B00BSHYZGY,"This movie was ok in that it addressed the topic adequately, i.e. the emptiness of certain lifestyles choices. The main drawback seems to be the writing. I enjoyed Hallowell's performance; a little more relevant (not gratuitous)frontal nudity would have been better with the title ""The Endless Possibility of Hell"".",1373241600,6,315,5.448979591836735
