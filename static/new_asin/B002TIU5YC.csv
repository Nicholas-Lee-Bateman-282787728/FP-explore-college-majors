8380196,3,B002TIU5YC,This DVD is a good resource of information. You can select and view individual chapters or play all in sequence. The low video quality is tolerable but suggests that it is a copy of earlier VHS recordings. The information is somewhat antiquated and applicable for older rifle versions. Beginners will have to do some research to adapt the information to newer AR versions. I recommend this DVD for anyone needing basic information beyond the owner manuals.,1391990400,,456,5.0131578947368425
8380197,5,B002TIU5YC,Very good DVD. Clear and easy to understand. Shows everything you need to know. Shows a lot of other DVDs you can buy for other guns and even shows a little info on them I thought was cool.,1385769600,,189,4.0

8380199,5,B002TIU5YC,"This is just as advertised.
Clear and in focus shots, with the instructor giving good descriptions and hints along the way.
Not so boring that you will need the Hemlock midway thru...
Gave me the confidence to begin building my own AR (or two...).
The rest of that DVD is a sales promotional...I did NOT want to pay for that.....

8380200,5,B002TIU5YC,"This DVD is excellent..!  It delivers the goods.  It breaks the process down, so using the menu, the user is able to zero-in on the part of the rifle needing attention.  The DVD is  instructional, presented in a methodical, step-by-step format. It can seem a bit dry, but then again, it is not for entertainment. I recommend it highly.",1314748800,4,335,4.627118644067797
