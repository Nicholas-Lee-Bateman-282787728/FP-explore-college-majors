The picture and sound are good, you either watch it on a computer on or a PAL compatible player. The film is great. ",1435017600,,258,4.0588235294117645
7937337,5,B00005BFB1,"First comes the music. Then we have the different characters. All so complex and going toward a tragic but inevitable ending. Romy Schneider is beautiful, Michel Piccoli so touching. A classic!! A must see",1243382400,,205,5.0588235294117645
7937338,5,B00005BFB1,"The first shot of the film shows us a pompous car accident in a marvelous slow motion sequence. And gradually through magnificent flashbacks, we will realize about the lives and time of this simple man, his love affairs through magnificent combination of lights where we can concatenate finely until his last suspire.

After you watch it, go for Intersection, and you will realize the difference.

A winner film of the prestigious prize Louis Delluc, 1970.",1177286400,2,456,5.066666666666666
