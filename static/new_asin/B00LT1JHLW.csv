UPDATE 12/03 - An Announcement RE: Information on Missing Content and Replacement Discs

Below is the information Warner Bros just sent out regarding the missing content and replacement discs. This applies to both the DVD and Blu-ray versions of the set (you'll notice no format is specified below): Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (WBHE) will provide fans with replacement discs and digital repairs to the few minor technical issues identified in its recent release of Batman: The Complete Television Series.

 Amounting to less than five minutes of footage within the 50-plus hours of entertainment, the issues encompass one 60-second dropped scene in the episode entitled ""Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds""; a brief piece of rarely-heard William Dozier narration that originally opened the pilot episode, ""Hi Diddle Riddle""; and an assembly of villain tags from the end of assorted episodes.

 ""The restoration process of this footage - spanning 48 years and two major studios - has been a super heroic task, and we deeply regret even the smallest of glitches occurring in that process,"" said Rosemary Markson, Senior Vice President, TV Brand Management & Retail Marketing, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. ""We recognize our obligation to the fans of this landmark series, and we have worked diligently to identify all issues and provide resolutions as quickly as possible.""

 To resolve these issues for consumers purchasing Batman: The Complete Television Series, WBHE will make available complete replacement discs for the discs that originally included the episodes ""Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds"" and ""Hi Diddle Riddle."" The villain tags will be re-issued as an assembled string on one of the aforementioned discs and, as an added bonus, WBHE has acquired rights and legal clearances to both a Bat-vehicle teaser that originally aired as part of the second season-opening ""Shoot A Crooked Arrow"" episode, and one of the original promotional tags that aired on the original showing of the ""The Duo Defy"" episode. Additionally, all fixes will be made to all Digital HD versions of Batman: The Complete Television Series.

 To obtain the replacement discs, consumers who have purchased Batman: The Complete Television Series are directed to [...]

6503744,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Im giving it 5 stars just because it's the original Adam West Batman. I wasn't born when it first aired, but always watched reruns growing up in the late 80's early 90's.  I remember loving the show.  I don't know what is in store for this product.  I'm just happy that its coming to Blu Ray.  As the five star rating says, Love it.  I repeat, I just love the fact its coming out, and already preordered it.",1405555200,11,407,4.166666666666667

6503746,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Rewrote my review after picking up the product.

For years now I've been wanting the 1960's Batman TV series on Blu-Ray, and that being said I'm very satisfied with this release.  The video and audio quality are much better than I expected, and are perfectly remastered. When it comes down to the packaging it's just awesome!  The quality is way beyond of what I expected, and on top of that there are so many extras that are included.

What's In The Box:

Series Box:  Not only is the box filled with colors, but it's quality is very impressive.  The box is the first thing consumers see, and I can't stress enough of how important the box is.  I just love all the little details that the box has, plus everything fits perfectly inside of the box.  There's even a thread to help pull the Blu-Ray cases out, so you won't have any trouble getting them out.

Episode Guide: The episode guide is a very useful addition to this release.  Each guide includes a short letter from Adam West, original air date, episode villain, writer, director, episode information and special features.

The Adam West Scarpbook: The Scarpbook is exactly what it sounds like.  It's a short hardcover book filled with colorful photos from the series.

Hotwheels Batmobile: I use to collect Hotwheels when I was young, and I can't say how pleased I am that this was included.  It doesn't feel like a cheap Hotwheels car at all, and if fact it's quite Heavey for a Hotwheels car.

44 Batman Cards: These are basically just Batman trading cards. Nothing much to say about them, but they're another nice addition.

The three seasons come in three separate Blu-Ray foldable cases.  After careful inspection it's clear that the discs are very safe in these cases.  There's no way that any discs will fall out' or get scratched.  They are much more sturdier than they look.

Digital Copy: It's always awesome when publishers include a digital copy.

This entire campy series that'll remind you of when comic books didn't always take themselves so seriously (Christopher Nolan/Zack Snyder I'm looking at you and your Batnipples).

This is the nicest box set that I have seen, which includes all 120 classic Batman episodes from all 3 seasons (1966-68), with an extra disc containing over 3 hours of bonus material.

The overall packaging is high quality, containing a sturdy collectors case with cool artwork and a button feature located on the side of the box that plays a section of the Batman theme song when activated. The Blue-Ray discs are well packaged in three separate protective fold-out sleeves that contain photographs of your favorite characters from the show: The Penguin, Cat Woman, Joker, Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Bat Girl, etc. Overall, this is an excellent product - Amazon also did a great job delivering the Bat merchandise fast, in brand new/excellent condition and at a great Bat price!

However when it finally was released they did a fine job.  Thankfully it came out when it did and Yvonne did sign mine.

6503924,5,B00LT1JHLW,"When reviewing any kind of retrospective remastered box set such as this, it is impossible not to use the Star Trek restored BluRay set as the high water mark by which all others must now be compared to. That stated, these Batman remastered BluRay's look wonderful! It is highly likely that the source tapes were not in as bad shape as the Star Trek ones were, and hence required less restoration (the Star Trek masters were in ROUGH shape). The picture and colors on the Batman remastered box set are beautiful; crisp and vibrant, the sound clean and clear. If one were to give the Star Trek remasters a 10/10 score, then I would give this Batman remaster set an 8.5/10 which is an excellent rating considering the near flawless benchmark set by the Star Trek box set (small details that the Star Trek restoration team did like rerecord the opening theme music using the original score and the EXACT instruments with modern day recording technology were brilliant decisions, and that is one little thing that I believe these Batman remasters would have benefitted from, but as they did not do it, it does not diminish the excellent nature of this box set).

I am absolutely loving the individual shows, they are really that good, charming and funny, and the acting is incredible, so much character and charisma brought forth by the actors that made Batman the truly timeless classic that it is.

The box set packaging itself is out of this world. The booklets included are beautiful, full of information and rare photos, and augment the content in the best possible way. In the end though, it is all about the shows themselves, and one word can describe them; priceless. To get to watch them in stunning, crisp vibrant color is what we were all waiting for.",1462579200,4,1758,4.704545454545454

6503948,3,B00LT1JHLW,"Bait and switch.  Another Flixster scam.  I stopped using Flixster when my purchases disappeared after a couple of years. The Amazon description says the digital copy is ""Ultraviolet"" which is what I wanted.  I use Ultraviolet on several providers, but mainly VUDU.  However, this copy is only good on Flixster.  Not only that, to use it, you must link your Ultraviolet account to Flixster and agree to let Flixster manage it.  Totally unacceptable.  The bottom line is the digital copy is worthless.  Due to the Flixster nastiness,  I would give this only a one star review, but I like the old Batman series too much to do that.  Don't know when I will get to watch it.

Then the DVD started and I was amazed to see an elderly man with a poor shape dancing around in a unitard. Where was Michael Keaton? Jack Nicholson?

6503952,4,B00LT1JHLW,"After all these years, it's finally here! This set has all 120 episodes, and the quality looks/sounds very good. The bonus stuff is nice. 4 stars instead of 5 because it COULD HAVE BEEN even better with a few changes. For instance, the 1966 movie is not included. Also, while the box looks cool when closed, it's a little bit of a pain to get to the discs. The 3 seasons are in individual boxes that stack up and go in a hole in the main box, and the only way to get them out is by pulling on a ribbon to lift them out. Then the way some of the discs are secured, they're a little awkward to get in and out. Finally, it's just a small thing, but they really wasted an opportunity with the on screen menus. They are the most basic, uninteresting menus ever... but they get the job done.

The first boxset I received, the button on the side of the box didn't work, and one of the discs was defective, so I recommend at least putting all the discs in your player to make sure they load within the return period, just in case there's an issue. Thankfully, I found the defective disc early enough, and Amazon was fast at replacing the set. I'm very happy with the set I have now!",1455753600,3,1174,4.149122807017544

6503988,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I have to say that I am extremely pleased with this amazing set that I have just received in the mail today! If you like classics, especially when it comes to seeing the 1966 Adam West Batman on the screen along with his trusty sidekick Robin, than this is the perfect set to add to your movie nostalgia collection!

I love classics! Especially when they are put on blu-Ray disks. It's amazing to see these classics brought back to life especially when it's done through picture and sound in high definition. That's what you should expect coming from a Blu-Ray disc anyway. Let's just say it has been a pleasure getting to see this wonderful show come back to life once again especially through high definition!

This set includes...

- the complete 3 seasons
- 44 vintage trading cards( note, the cards are replicas not the actual cards from the 60s which would probably be much more expensive but the art work on the cards are still fun to look at).
- Also comes with a hard cover Adam West scrapbook.
- Comes with a 32 page complete episode guide which also mentions the villains that are in the episodes which I thought was pretty nice to see.
- Comes with a Hot Wheels replica of the Batmobile!
- Finally comes with a Bonus disc which is loaded with over 3 hours worth of extras- this includes documentaries and also the first episode that introduces batgirl into the series.

Also the packaging is very good quality. The box is very nice. Not for throwing out! This boxes' purpose is to keep everything together which is very helpful. So please don't throw out the box! The art work on the box is very nice as well. Also comes with a button on the side of the box which when pressed plays the theme song of the batman series which I thought was cool! So over all I have to say that this a very nice and well crafted set that Warner Home Videos has given us. Yes I will say that this is a little pricy, but I ended up finding this set on sale, so if you do find one on sale and want this to be added to your collection than I fully would recommend getting this set.

Also if you were wondering what is a better set to invest in then in my opinion it all preference of what the customer wants. If you want the full batman experience then obviously this set is for you. If you want just the videos and not the extra stuff then I guess get the other bluray set. Overall for collectors who just love Batman and the 1960s pop culture this set will definitely satisfy you.

The shipping was very fast as well. Took less days than I expected it would take for Prime time shipping!",1453161600,2,2578,4.3051546391752575

This show is really funny and it's obvious the writers were going for laughs. And there are a lot of great actors who came to have fun. Burgess Meredith is awesome, and Cesar Romero might make you rethink who the best Joker is. Great set for a series only available in bootlegs until its release.

6503998,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Being 27 years old, this series came way before my time, but I remember watching the re-runs on TV Land as a kid and I always got a kick out of it.

I've been a lifelong DC Comics fan:  watching every movie, watching every tv series, and collecting every comic I could possibly get my hands on.  This set, I will admit, is very much a ""guilty pleasure"" buy in that it's not like The Flash, Arrow, Gotham, or any other modern day series that has an over-arcing season long plot, impressive fights or special effects.  This is a Blu Ray set that you will basically buy to throw in a disc every now and again to relive some fun moments from your childhood.

The best aspect of this set is the restoration of the series.  The color quality and Blu Ray crispness of every episode is gorgeous.  The colors really pop off the screen and the sound quality is tremendous.

If you were a fan of the series or are just a plain Batman fan, this is a great series to own on Blu Ray.  You could get this one that comes with all of the collectibles and booklets as that stuff is a lot of fun to read through, or you could get the set that is just the discs.  I bought this one because I loved the packaging and got a kick out of looking through all the props and collectibles that come with this set with my father as he used to love watching this show in the 60's.

6504165,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Batman was the epitome of hip back in '66.  It had just the right mix of comic book color, style, and a swinging hip soundtrack to make it stand the test of time.  The acting was intentionally campy, but consistent, so everything flows perfectly.

Unlike the darker Frank Miller inspired movies, this Batman was the ultimate good guy, loved by everyone, except the villains, and each week, they were the real key to the show's success.  Back then, every A-List celebrity wanted to be on the show.

As I mentioned before, style was a big part of the show.  They took great efforts to give viewers a real comic book experience, by not only using comic book colors, but using classic comic book graphics like ""Pow"", ""Wham"", and ""Zing"".  One of my favorite details is the ""Villain Cam"", where the camera slants slightly whenever the scene centers around the Villain.  Simply genius.

Because the show was shot on film, rather than video, it was inevitable that they would one day restore it as a Blu-Ray release.  The cool thing about ""Restoring"" most things is that you expect it to be as it was when it was new, but in the case of Blu-Ray, this means that the result is something far better than it looked when people saw it in 1966.  You have to remember, back in the 60s, TV resolutions were in the range of about 200 lines, far less than today's 1080, giving us the chance to see details that could never be seen on the 21 inch TVs of the 60s.  One other thing that is often overlooked is the sound.  TVs of the 60s had crude sound, so once again the Blu-Ray is a vast improvement on the way the show was originally aired.

My only problem is the price.  They actually have another package that is not listed as ""Limited Edition"" that costs a little less, and some say it not only has the same discs, but that one disc is actually improved, because they had a technical issues with the first release that required a recall.  In either case, the real prize isn't that it's a Limited Edition, or that it has improved packaging or bonus features, it's the show itself.  That's what you want to see, and thanks to Blu-Ray, we can now see this show with detail that wasn't possible when it was originally aired.  For that, it's clearly a 5 star collection.",1428019200,2,2252,4.437956204379562
6504166,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Awesome show.  I loved it as a kid and now my 8-year-old loves it too.  Clean and sometimes silly, but always entertaining.  And sincere.

Thankfully, The series has not lost it's appeal, and I am grateful to Warner Brothers that they managed to at last make it available to the television public.
Only slight criticism would be with the audio - although it is crystal clear, the soundtrack does not appear to be normalised (that is, some parts are discernably louder than others - maybe this Is on purpose, as usually involves action/fighting scenes).

6504243,5,B00LT1JHLW,"The 1960s Batman TV series was a 30 minute show on ABC about a millionaire named Bruce Wayne played by (Adam West) and his young ward named Dick Grayson played by (Burt Ward). When there wasn't any crime fighting to be done in Gotham City they were just Bruce Wayne & Dick Grayson to everyone around them. The two unsuspecting heroes were also known to the public as Batman and Robin. Together they worked to rid Gotham City of its villains whenever they were called upon by Commissioner Gordon. With the use of their Batmobile that was kept in the Batcave far below the Wayne mansion, Batman & Robin could arrive anywhere in what seemed only seconds. They didn't have any super powers so they had to rely on their physical strength and an assortment of high tech gadgetry to capture Gothams criminals week after week. The show was an instant hit and the whos who of Hollywood lined up to be part of it.

ZONK!  ZAPP!  ZOWIE!  The year was 1972 and Batman was being aired in syndication from Detroit and my father had just purchased a new RCA colored TV. I can still remember the first time I heard Robin say, ""Atomic batteries to power...turbines to speed."" and Batman would respond, ""Roger, ready to move out. As an 8 year old I was always puzzled on how two seemingly normal guys could open a secret bookcase in the study, slide down a couple poles and emerge in the Batcave in full costume and jump directly into the Batmobile ready to fight crime.

Onto the limited edition Blu-ray boxed set from Warner Home Video. Its true what they say all good things come to those who wait and boy did I wait. So what do you get for the price? You get all 120 episodes of this classic TV show with amazing picture & sound. I don't know what kind of restoration went into the video & audio from Warner but the picture and sound are the best I have ever seen or heard. Until Warner studios decides to do a complete frame by frame restoration, this is probably the best this set will ever look & sound and it really is amazing! This Blu-ray set has breathed new life into this iconic show and fans fortunate enough to grab it will be glad they did!

You get a beautifully decorated & detailed sturdy boxed shell that houses all three seasons of the show in their own season sets. You get a 32 page episode guide and the Adam West scrapbook as well as some retro trading cards and a hot wheels Batmobile. There is also a button on the side of the box that plays a brief clip of the batman song, when you press it. The one thing I had hoped would be included was bonus content and there is over three hours of bonus material include in this set.

Bonus Features Include:
- Holy Memorabilia Batman!
- Hanging with Batman
- Batmania Born!
- Bats of the Round Table

I'm not sure if that means there is a problem with a lot of Bat Man enthusiasts wanting to watch the same episode at one time or not but every time I have VUDU check my internet speed it always tops out as being HDX (their highest quality) but especially for certain episodes in Season 3 it seems to start an then putter out.

That being said the show is still cool and I would suggest getting it if you are a fan. There is an extra disk which shows you some interesting things of what is done with the show. Also some things that people will collect which are good as well. The blu ray transfer is beautiful and you see many things (down to the jokers mustache haha),1425168000,4,636,4.137096774193548

6504282,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Holy Clarity! What a genuine pleasure. The picture and sound quality is nothing short of marvelous here. Experiencing this collection is tantamount to entering a time machine and becoming eight years old again, soaking up the Batman reruns. It's a hoot, plain and simple. The vivid colors of costumes and props and sets nearly explode, and the Nelson Riddle music score swells. The interiors of stately Wayne Manor are much larger than I recall, and more sumptuous.

Seeing all these guest stars is a delight, as they give life to their wacky characters and cause all matter of mayhem in Gotham City. I'm sure every celebrity wanted to make an appearance as a villain on this show in the 1960's. And the comedy of ""Batman"" seems even funnier now, so tongue-in-cheek ... I mean, the Gotham City Museum actually has a ""Hall of Fabulous Jewels"". And while driving to vanquish an arch enemy, Batman makes Robin practice his high school Spanish lessons. These writers had a blast, obviously.

This boxed set is a prize, a true jewel for any classic television collection. It took a long time to get released on home video, but the result is a joy to behold.",1425081600,2,1152,4.72636815920398
6504283,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Nice to FINALLY have this on Blu-ray after all this time!

I like the first year the best as the longer the show was on the sillier it became. Picture was good as (IF NOT BETTER) than originally aired. Sound ranged from very good to good enough. Colors were vibrant and everything was crystal clear. I, personally, felt the price was in line with what you get but can understand those on a fixed income feeling otherwise.

The 'extras' didn't matter much to me as I generally buy sets such as this for the show itself.

I would have preferred that this show be played a little more straight but it wasn't - it is what it is. And that's plenty good enough to watch along with the Lone Ranger, Star Trek (orginial and TNG) and a few other shows from my youth!

My wife and I watch one of these shows once or twice a week - Batman, TNG, etc along with Shark Tank and maybe Pawn Stars and that's about 75% of our TV viewing.

I would rate this a very good 9.0 to 9.5 out of ten - not perfect (things seldom are!) but very close! Highly recommended!",1424995200,,1044,4.174129353233831

This show made me the Batman fan I am today. Sure, it is a little campy and very 60's...but it is still wonderful fun.",1424822400,,286,4.519230769230769
6504287,5,B00LT1JHLW,"A while back I purchased another remastered blu-ray set: the entire James Bond series. EACH and EVERY frame on those Bond films was painstakingly digitized in 4K, recolored, cleaned up, and downsampled to blu-ray format. And it shows - every scene is impeccable.

I expected the same with this set - and boy was I VERY DISAPPOINTED that when this set was remastered that only MOST of the scenes in an episode were redone, not ALL scenes. If you're able to watch this on a high-end television with a VIVID MODE (e.g. Sony Bravia Engine 6 or above or similar television with an extended, extra-bright palette available), this becomes quite apparent as about 4 out of 5 scenes are beautifully rendered and then suddenly an episode cuts to a scene that is grainy, dull, and has much less color and has artifacts present (hair, black spots, etc).  They obviously did this to save money on the remastering and it only affects scenes that either have words appearing on the screen, minor cut scenes less than about 5 seconds, or scenes where there is a lot of action. Having said that though, there are a LOT of scenes that fall into those last 3 categories so each episode is CONSTANTLY cutting back and forth between a remastered scene and a non-remastered scene of much less quality.

I was able to eventually work around this issue by putting my television into ""THEATRE"" mode which substantially dulls the brightness/contrast and gives each frame a much softer look. I'm able to tell if I look closely now but it's not the glaring SHOCK that it was watching these in a VIVID  mode. Overall I'm happy with the set (especially since I scored it on a gold-box discount), but still - they really should have gone ALL THE WAY with the remastering, especially on a set that's limited to 95,000 printings.",1424736000,2,1796,4.674050632911392

The ONLY PROBLEM I had (and the reason for 4 and not 5 stars) is that one of the episodes on the first disc is unreadable by any BD player or drive I own.  Out of nearly 150 episodes, there's just one that won't play past the 15 minute mark.  I thought about sending the set back, but decided it wasn't worth it.",1421193600,4,494,4.223404255319149
6504392,4,B00LT1JHLW,"Love the show, I mean no one is going to purchase this box set if they don't like the show.  But the extras?  Meh, they could have been so much better.  I appreciate the screen tests for West and Ward and the network presentation for Batgirl, this is good stuff.  But the other extras were I felt were rather flat.

I have a great deal of respect for Adam West.  He's a working actor, meaning he'd take any work he could get and I respect that.  He was terribly typecast after the series ended and given very few choices for work over the years but made the best of it.  The round table discussion with West, Kevin Smith, Phillip Morris, etc.....I couldn't have cared less.  The short piece on the musical theme with the star of Arrow not knowing how it went?  Who cares?

What I would have loved to have seen was a ""pop up video"" which you could turn on and off while watching the series.  Pop ups could have provided a lot of trivia and yes, trivial information but it would have been interesting.  For example the episodes could have mentioned something like....""this is Julie Newmar's fourth appearance as Catwoman""; give us information how the arch criminal celebrities were chosen/cast, note what is stock footage,  mention how King Tut was written for the series but then adapted for the comics, tell us that the Puzzler was originally written for the Riddler but Frank Gorshin was in a contract dispute and didn't make any season two appearances.  Fun information.

I'm still giving the boxset high marks because the series looks so good, but the extras really really left me wanting more....",1421193600,4,1600,4.6007067137809186

6504417,2,B00LT1JHLW,"I am grateful that Warner Brothers finally got together with everyone involved in the 1966 series and released it on BluRay and DVD. The reason that I am giving this set a low rating is simple. This was promised as the Complete Television Series and a Limited Edition that cost nearly $200. There is no excuse as to why the ""Next week Batman faces the Riddler"" etc. were not included in an overwhelming majority of episodes. Before you criticize that statement, please consider what this release would have been like if only a handful of episodes included the ""Batman In Color"" at the beginning of each episode. I watched Batman on its original network run on ABC in 1966. One of the things kids would look forward to was who Batman would face next week. How someone at WB could overlook these ""next week"" clips that were readily available for use but left out is beyond me. To me, WB cannot justify charging a whopping $200.00 for this incomplete set. The reason that I decided to write the review is because WB would not respond to my e-mail asking them to either re-release each disc with the ""next week"" tags put in or cut a partial refund check for the people who spent the extra dollars on the Limited Edition set. I hesitated writing this review but believe that people who have not spent the high dollar amount for the special Limited Edition set should know what is not included. I read that WB is making replacement discs available for a couple of episodes with missing scenes in this same set. If they can do that, they can go back and correct this glaring mistake that takes away from this great show.",1420761600,6,1613,4.527397260273973

It's nice to finally have the show in an official release after years of crusty tv and Internet viewings. I'm not crazy about the blu ray menus. They aren't animated or fun at all. A very basic bar appears on the bottom of the screen and it doesn't match the Batman look at all. The packaging is really cool and high quality. The box is made of extra thick cardboard. The side of the box has a button you press and it plays the theme song from the show! The front of the box is die cut and opens up. It is held closed with a magnet inside the cardboard. The die cast car is pretty cool, but is slightly cheapo and it has a large dopey looking trailer hitch that is right in front of the rocket exhaust. Not sure why they put that there. The card set is really cool, it replicated the entire 44 card topps set from 1966 with art by Norman Saunders. These cards are pretty pricey for originals. One quip is that the images on the cards are slightly pixilated like they used low res scans for printing. Most people won't notice or care, but being a graphic artist I always notice low quality printing. The Discs and packaging look nice. I wasn't too impressed with the Adam West Scrap book. It is very thin and could have been better especially being hard cover bound. I like the overall design of the package, it is very pop art looking but in a modern way. Me personally, I would have made it look more like something printed in the 60s like the Batmanga book by Chip Kidd.

If's hard to get a grip on the edge, and when I get disc loose it slides too much, and a hassle to keep if from dropping on the table.

The caviar looks so real that you can't believe this was done with props rather than the real caviar.  You could see the scratches on the floor where she is dancing too.  The detail is incredible.

6504591,3,B00LT1JHLW,"After the excellent audio remastering Warners did for the BD release of Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" and ""Vertigo"" and many of my other favorites, the VERY long-awaited issuing of the DVD and BD versions of the 1965-68 Batman TV series was a stunningly painful blow of disappointment. Numerous reviews online attest to Warners' appalling decision to go with lossy Dolby 1.0 over DTS or other lossless audio formats. Indeed, its doubtful that Warners even bothered to use the original analog mag tape elements to do the digital transfers. Though the streams of old Hollywood stars and the clever campiness of the scripts made the series unforgettable, it was Neil Hefti's baddass opening theme and Nelson Riddle's totally kickass score that rocked my early teenage world when the series debuted. This is by far the saddest DVD and BD review I've ever done. As a music lover and audiophile I am heartbroken and enraged by Warners' indifferent treatment of one of the most memorable soundtracks in TV history. Despite the reviews, will I still buy the Batman series boxed set? Ironically, I will go with BD version, but only because BD discs have an extra layer of protection against scratches than do DVDs-though the sound quality will certainly be no better. What a horrible shame.",1418428800,3,1284,5.0046728971962615

6504610,4,B00LT1JHLW,"This is an awesome collection for the video library and a must own for any one who loved this series and watched it as a kid.  The video quality is truly amazing and has been executed very well.  The images are sharp with good color saturation and it looks incredible.  I've noticed on some episodes that there is some noise in the images either from the original film or perhaps an oversampling of the sharpening effect; but it still looks really good.  The video maintains the standard 4:3 aspect ratio of the original broadcast, so the image has a lot of black on both sides.  But, I'd rather have it that way than a pan and scan image which fills the screen but cuts off part of the image.

This set includes every single episode from all three seasons and it has some bonus features which I have not had time to explore yet as I am watching all of the episodes in order first starting with season one.  The set also include a miniature bat mobile hot wheels car that is pretty detailed and looks great.  They included a trailer hitch on the back of the bat mobile so you can pull the bat boat on a trailer which Mattel also offers separately.  Sorry guys, but the original bat mobile had no trailer hitch and I never saw it pulling the bat boat; it was always in the water at the dock ready for action.  Therefore, I surgically removed the trailer hitch on my bat mobile with an x-acto knife.  I'm a purist, and things must be modeled correctly.  The trading cards were pretty cheap and honestly add no value to the collection as they are comic drawings and not actual photographs like true trading cards.

The only reason I did not give five stars to this amazing collection is because of the sound quality.  Unlike the video which was greatly enhanced and improved, it appears that the producers of this collection chose not to enhance the audio.  The sound I'm pretty sure is mono and has not been enhanced in anyway.  I have to really turn up the volume on my receiver in order to hear the dialogue and I'm a little disappointed that not a greater effort was made with the audio portion.  It would've been nice if they could've bumped the levels up a bit and enhanced the sound a little to match the stunning picture quality.  Also, the navigation menu system is really unimpressive and appears to be a last minute, bare bones after thought.  I agree menu systems are not critically important, but when they are well done and don't repeat the theme song over and over again, it does add a nice touch.

All in all, this is a great product and a must own if you ever once imagined being Batman or, like me, ran around the house as a kid wearing a diaper tied around your neck for a cape and battling crime until bedtime, then this one is for you.  Highly recommended.",1418256000,4,2774,4.37890625

6504657,5,B00LT1JHLW,"REPLACEMENT DISCS ARE NOW AVAILABLE.
I have been in contact with Warner Home Video for the past few weeks over the missing content on both the Blu-ray & DVD releases of Batman The Complete Series.  Warner is now offering a replacement disc program.  Here is their notice:

Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (WBHE) will provide fans with replacement discs and digital repairs to the few minor technical issues identified in its recent release of Batman: The Complete Television Series.

Amounting to less than five minutes of footage within the 50-plus hours of entertainment, the issues encompass one 60-second dropped scene in the episode entitled ""Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds""; a brief piece of rarely-heard William Dozier narration that originally opened the pilot episode, ""Hi Diddle Riddle""; and an assembly of villain tags from the end of assorted episodes.

""The restoration process of this footage - spanning 48 years and two major studios - has been a super heroic task, and we deeply regret even the smallest of glitches occurring in that process,"" said Rosemary Markson, Senior Vice President, TV Brand Management & Retail Marketing, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. ""We recognize our obligation to the fans of this landmark series, and we have worked diligently to identify all issues and provide resolutions as quickly as possible.""

To resolve these issues for consumers purchasing Batman: The Complete Television Series, WBHE will make available complete replacement discs for the discs that originally included the episodes ""Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds"" and ""Hi Diddle Riddle."" The villain tags will be re-issued as an assembled string on one of the aforementioned discs and, as an added bonus, WBHE has acquired rights and legal clearances to both a Bat-vehicle teaser that originally aired as part of the second season-opening ""Shoot A Crooked Arrow"" episode, and one of the original promotional tags that aired on the original showing of the ""The Duo Defy"" episode. Additionally, all fixes will be made to all Digital HD versions of Batman: The Complete Television Series.

To obtain the replacement discs, consumers who have purchased Batman: The Complete Television Series are directed to www(dot)warnerbros(dot)com/help/customer-service.

Worldwide demand for the Limited Edition box set of Batman: The Complete Television Series has been tremendous, resulting in widespread retailer sellouts and rapidly dwindling inventories heading into the holiday season. To fulfill consumer interest, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment has announced a new streamlined Blu-ray(tm) box set that includes all 120 episodes and matching enhanced content from the limited edition set, but without the added premium items or Digital HD copy. Purchasers of this set will also need to utilize the customer service website to obtain replacement discs.",1417564800,17,2847,5.498855835240275

LANGUAGES: ENGLISH
but surprised for this US-Release:
contains also a DUBBED german (mono) track!!! incl. german subtitles and MENU in german

THE PICTURE QUALITY: SUPERB!!! (= SHARP, CLEAN, COLORFUL)
SOUND: PRETTY GOOD

story: Batman and his boywonder friend Robin (Burt Ward) fighting against super-villains played by super stars like: Vincent Price, Julie Newmar, Shelley Winters, Roddy McDowall, Liberace, Cesar Romero, and many more. - 120 episodes.

Its pur comic entertainment, campy and fun as it should be! Of course, those who awaiting something like Dark Knight - they're wrong here. Its the show cheap? Compared with the TV today: yes. But the show was made in 1966-68.

This Set contains Adam West Scrapbook with any pics (ok, I've expected a little bit more), Episode-Guide booklet, trading-cards, a mini-mini-Batmobile and about 3 hours bonus-features/documentaries incl. Interviews.

FAZIT: might be a little bit expensive with $ 179.00 for any people but the whole show (120 episodes) are NOW restored. Im happy with this quality and Set. With other words: I LOVE IT.

ALTERNATE: There are available also cheaper complet boxes (without the booklets and batmobile) on BR and DVD.

INFO: nice gimmick -> on the right side of the box is a ""hidden"" button. Push it and you will hear a ""sound""!

Is this TV Serie also for KIDS?: YES at age of six.

GERMAN:

Lang erwartet und endlich erhltlich: 120 Episoden, restauriert und nun in hervorragender Bildqualitt!

Das beste an dieser US-Box: die Blu-Ray sind CODEFREI und enthalten:
Sprache: nebst original Englisch auch DEUTSCH, ITALIENISCH, FRANZSISCH
UNTERTITEL: Englisch, Deutsch, iTALIENISCH, FRANZSISCH,
Menu-Sprache: u.a. Englisch, sowie auch Deutsch
(wer beim Player deutsch eingestellt hat, der bekommt automatisch das Menu in deutsch)

Aus heutiger Sicht wirkt die Serie etwas billig aber die Serie entstand 1966, wo das TV noch ein kleines Medium war. Der Grund warum die Kostme/Kulissen knallbunt sind, ist, damit sich die Kostme auf dem schwarz/weiss TV (welche viele Leute damals hatten) besser voneinander abheben.

Das Tolle: viele Super-Gaststars als Superschurken wie Julie Newmar, Vincent Price, Roddy McDowall, Shelley Winters, George Sanders etc.

Was bekommen wir zu sehen: knallbunte, selbstironische Comic-Feuerwerk und ist auch fr Kinder ab 6 geeignet.

Das Set enthlt: ein Fotobuch von Adam West, Ein Episoden-Booklet, Trading-Cards, ein mini-Batmobile sowie 3 Stunden an Bonus-Material / Dokumentation mit (neuen) Interviews.

FAZIT: BAT-astic!!!!

INFO: auf der rechten Seite der Box gibt es einen ""versteckten"" Button. Diese drcken, dann ertnt einen Sound.

Alternative:
es gibt gnstigere Komplett-boxen ohne booklets bzw, mini-Batmobile auf Blu-Ray (sowie DVD, die noch gnstiger ist).",1417392000,3,2799,5.592417061611374
6504662,5,B00LT1JHLW,"The 1966 Batman series is what it is.  For many , whether you watched it when it was originally on TV or (as I did) in syndication  it was the first foray into the Batman character and world, and it was one of the first superhero television shows.  Certainly the quality of the show itself is not great when compared against some of the Batman movies, but then it never tried to take itself that seriously.  In fact a lot of times the show poked fun at itself.  Yes the episodes were extremely repetitive, and everything that happened every week defied logic if you think about it too much (like the villains getting caught every time, only to get out of jail within a few weeks, always leaving Batman and Robin to die, only to have them escape from the trap every time).  But it also tied in action, a little bit of real science (along with a ton of fake science), mystery and comedy.

No, this is not the Tim Burton or Christopher Nolan darker representations of Batman.  It really is a comedic spoof of the comic, yet they played it seriously all while giving a wink and a nod to the viewers.  It is a show that when you were a kid you did not see or get much of the humor, but as an adult you can see they were really pushing some boundaries with the double entendres (mainly involving Catwoman) and some of the jokes that did get in there.  But of course, back then they could not even make a show on par with what can be shown on the current show Gotham.  Realistically though, everyone reading this will know what the series is like.

Where the set really shines is in all the extras.  There are a ton of special features on the last disc of the season 3 set.  All the seasons are packaged individually in the limited edition case, so if you want to put the seasons on a shelf you can.  One of the best features is a half hour long feature on Adam West, and his career up to getting the part and his life afterward.  There is also a great extra where the two pilot episodes are run with cut ins of Adam West talking about the script and how he approached and played various scenes.  There is also a feature on the memorabilia of Batman, with a focus on material from the series and the time the series was on, screen tests for Adam West and Burt Ward, and several others of varying length with interviews with the actors and surviving show runners.

If you were in any way a fan of the show, whether you have seen all the episodes or not, this is definitely worth picking up.  It will be a chance to relive your childhood a bit, get a nice chuckle and get some insight into what was a relatively short lived series (only 3 seasons, but as many episodes as would cover 5+ seasons these days) but has probably remained more popular than any other Superhero series that followed it, even those who stayed on the air much longer.",1417305600,5,2832,4.2598130841121495
6504663,5,B00LT1JHLW,"ABOUT FRIGGIN TIME! But, just one question..how the heck do they put on those costumes while sliding down the poles??!!!!",1417305600,4,121,5.1
6504664,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Quality of the image 4.5/5 ; audio 3/5. (Technically it's just fine, but could have been remastered into quality, but understandable why they did not). Quality of the package: 4.5/5. (The box side has a button to press to hear the theme music!! Very cool Easter egg)
Things I would have changed with the presentation:
1.  The presentation gave very little props to batgirl. Granted she was only in 22 episodes, but equally important to the show. A fan booklet should have been part of the package.
 2.  The box opens from the top and therefore has NO SLIPCASE. Collectors items deserve and need a slipcase. The slip case protects the box from scratches and such. Typically you can slice the plastic and tape it down on the slip case so that you can slip the box in and out and keep it from being marred. So, in this case, you cannot keep the plastic on if you want to open the package...so I can't image there will be many high quality editions around in a few years.
3. There are only 95,000 of these in print. But they only opted to put a tiny little sticker on the bottom of the box... Like I said, due to no protection, this will invariable fall off from dust over the years. The edition number should have been imprinted on the box and at least a certificate of authenticity should have been included like other limited editions.
4. Big miss - why is a fake Hot Wheels Batmobile included in the box.... And it doesn't have the famous license plate ""2F-3567""! A real Hot Wheels edition should have been included. What's it to Warner if HotWheels charges them $10 per,  even $20... They'll just recoup the cost by charging for it in the box...that's what they're doing with this fake Batmobile. (But, hey, at least it looks good and rolls straight for a long distance... I'm glad it's there,though. Just wish it was the real product versus a knockoff.)

Good thing Fox and Warner worked out the licensing issue...just in time..I think they've lost their big audience for this set pussyfooting around figuring who will get the profits.",1417219200,3,2037,4.554644808743169
6504665,5,B00LT1JHLW,"The special Limited Edition Box Set is AMAZING, and a MUST. Beautifully laid out, with each disc on its own spindle, and lots of fun extras and goodies, this set will sell out FAST over Christmas. I agree the episode guide could've been easier to follow, by listing all the actors playing VILLAINS and their sidekicks in each episode, but that is a small gripe. The thing I find MASSIVE is that I can blow it up to WIDESCREEN on my TV, keeping it in the correct ratio, and it still looks FANTASTIC. Like the original Twilight Zone on blu-ray, the camera was shooting further enough away from the actors, so we don't miss out on too much at the top and bottom of the screen if blown up. Especially with the villains segments, which were shot at an angle. We really have LUCILLE BALL to thank here. She insisted ALL her TV shows be SHOT ON FILM for prosperity, and luckily so was BATMAN, in glorious COLOUR. We have to thank LUCY for STAR TREK too, her studio DESILU (which she owned and was head of with Desi) was the only one that said YES to STAR TREK as a TV series. So LUCY thought outside the box, & started the trend for QUALITY, so future generations could enjoy these shows on actual FILM. Not tape or video.
This is my Christmas Present, so I've only been sneaking a look at a few episodes. Marsha Queen of Diamonds with the delectable Carolyn Jones (Morticia Addams in THE ADDAMS FAMILY) is a lot of fun. Eartha Kitt in CATWOMAN'S DRESSED TO KILL, blowing up women's hairdo's at FASHIONATION magazine is a great episode. And seeing the SIXTIES fashion designer Rudy Gernreich do a MOD FASHION SHOW, blew me away. But THE BLACK WIDOW with Tallulah Bankhead and Liberace as CHANDELL in THE DEVIL'S FINGERS, must be the CAMPEST episodes ever. Chandell serenading Aunt Harriet, then as she leaves, rolling his eyes in complete disgust is pure Liberace. And seeing the gorgeous Edy Williams famous for Russ Meyer's BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, as a sidekick, was delightful. Tallulah Bankhead delivers in every way. Calling Batman 'Batman Doll', and Robin 'Robin Baby' just KILLS me. Read about HER life if you ever see a bio. She was a great stage and screen actress, and later a huge radio personality hosting THE BIG SHOW in the 50's. To get that deep raspy voice, she used to hold booze and cocaine filled parties that lastest for days. The openly bi-sexual actress lived a REALLY full life, and her best lines are legendary. So this Batman set brings back wonderful memories, and since I was little, I now know who all these old stars were, so its so much more enjoyable to watch today. Robert.

You can see details that were likely never meant to be seen -- the threads on Bruce Wayne's sweater, the outline of Commissioner Gordon's T-shirt under his shirt, the stitching on Batman's Cowl, dents on cars, nicks on set pieces -- it's amazing. Sound has (mostly) been enhanced -- fires crackle in fireplaces, paper rustles, and even background noises can be heard. All in all, the blu-ray version shows you images that will take your breath away. 35MM film really was incredible, and this restoration shows it off.

As far as the acting, episodes, and characters, there's nothing that I can add. I was a Batman fan as a child, and this series was why. It has never looked better, and it certainly doesn't disappoint!",1416873600,2,840,4.6375838926174495
6504680,5,B00LT1JHLW,"In terms of television shows or films, Adam West is, always has been, and (most likely) always will be the one and only TRUE Batman!

Now, he has finally returned in the form of this home video product.

You may be wondering, WHY is West the one and only true Batman? Great question, Bat-fans!  Let me answer that for you!

West's Batman is real because he is the only one who is a:

1.) DETECTIVE rather than a THUG!

West's Batman actually uses his intelligent mind to gather and investigate clues in order to solve mysteries and bring criminals to justice.

In contrast, fake Batmen are NOT detectives.  Rather, fake Batmen are meathead tough guy neanderthal thugs akin to the 300+ lb bouncer men you find guarding club entrances on Saturday night.  That is to say, fake Batmen are all brawn, zero brains!  The only difference between the real-life bouncers and the fake Batmen is that bouncers are morbidly obese; other than that, they are exactly the same!

Fake Batmen ""solve"" mysteries by beating up everyone they see, no questions asked.  They don't even use their minds at all.

Sometimes fake Batmen try to trick people into thinking that they are real, by using gadgets to beat people up.  But don't be fooled!

West's real Batman also uses gadgets...so, you might ask, how can you tell that the fake Batmen are in fact fake when they use gadgets just like the real Batman?  Easy!  Fake Batmen's gadgets are invented by their Man Friday servants who are vastly more intelligent than themselves  - because the fake Batmen have no brains of their own!  In contrast, West's Batman uses his own brilliant mind to invent all of his gadgets personally.

To be sure, West's Batman sometimes has to fight too, and when necessary, he can unleash an epic physical smack down on evildoers. BUT the difference between the real Batman (West) and the fake Batmen is that West uses violence only as a LAST RESORT, and with West, fights only break out AFTER he has already used his MIND to solve a mystery, and as a result, trapped the culprits in a corner.

Remember, Batman got his start in DETECTIVE Comics and to recap, those meathead tough guy neanderthal fake Batmen are thugs, NOT detectives!

2.) Crime-FIGHTER rather than a CRIMINAL!

West's real Batman, and his sidekick, Robin, are duly-appointed deputies of the law.  In other words, they are superhero versions of policemen.

Fake Batmen, on the other hand, are criminal scumbags who are themselves no better than their fellow criminals who they habitually physically assault.  Fake Batmen are vigilantes who violate the law.  West's real Batman is the opposite: a law-abiding citizen who upholds the law!

Remember this simple and foolproof test any time you are wondering if a Batman is real or fake: is this Batman a Crime-FIGHTER - OR - a CRIMINAL HIMSELF?  If the answer is the latter, he's not Batman!

3.) REAL MAN rather than a whiny, angsty, overgrown Emo Teen wimp!

Fake Batmen are whiny, angsty, overgrown Emo Teen wimps in men's bodies.  Physically, they may be adults, but mentally, they are immature little crybabies who never learned how to grow up...never learned how to be men!

West's real Batman, however, is ALWAYS a real man!  West presents himself in a dignified manner, befitting his Batman's/Bruce Wayne's status as a well-bred aristocrat and perfect gentlemen.  At all times, West is articulate, thoughtful, classy, and strong.

On the other hand, the Emo baby fake Batmen (Batboys?) spend most of their time, brooding, moping around and feeling sorry for themselves while they slack off - as criminals run roughshod all over Gotham City!

Fake Batmen are egotistical cowards who instead of doing any productive work, get busy inside of their own empty heads, incessantly crying,  ""Woe is me!  What a cruel world! I'm too much of a wimp & coward to handle it! Please pity me!  Please save me from my misery!""

Some fake Batmen even give outward signs of their utter patheticness and girly-boy status by displaying artificial nipples on their Batsuit armor!

By the way, unlike the fake Batmen, West's real Batman DOESN'T EVEN NEED ARMOR in the first place (his Batsuit is made of cloth), because he knows that he is MAN ENOUGH to get the job done without it!

Remember, BatMAN has MAN in his name.  So if the Batman you are watching is a self-loathing, egotistical, mental wuss of a girly-boy, he's NOT A MAN, he's a FAKE!

CONCLUSION:

So, in summary Bat-fans, do NOT settle for impostors; you are too good for that!  Just say NO to fake Batmen!  If you want the REAL Batman, West is the only man for you!

Thanks for reading this review, Bat-fans, and see you next time, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!",1416787200,14,4689,4.765217391304348
6504681,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I wanted to wait for a Black Friday deal but went ahead and got the 5 pay plan from the website batmanondvd.com. Mainly because I had just bought complete series sets of Hill Street Blues, X-Files and a couple more here on Amazon so I only had to pay the first payment of 34.99 plus tax on the full price so I have 4 more payments of 34.99 over the next 4 months. I also wanted the Adam West Naked DVD which I saw selling for close to 30.00 by itself rather than the Hot Wheels Batmobile. The Movie is also only DVD but I did buy the Blu-ray of it already. Also they will try to sell you a 2nd set for 30% off, the George Reeves Superman Series and Batman gift wrap for 4.95. I declined all these extras. I do not like the way they are hyping the 64 episode package but hopefully they will offer those who go for it the rest of the series later. If you have a 1080P HDTV and a Blu-ray player it is great to get this on Blu-ray. Compare to how I got Star Trek, the original series: I only bought one of the 2 episode DVDs for 14.95: the Season 3 with Yvonne Craig by the way! Then they put out Season 1 in the yellow plastic case for over 100.00. So I waited and got the complete series in the Yellow, Red and Blue plastic cases at Costco for almost 200.00. Then of course they came out on Blu-ray a couple years later for about 60.00 a season. So I have almost 400.00 tied up in those while with this Batman set I got it financed and will make the remaining 4 fairly painless payments of 34.99.

6504683,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Batman on blu ray, all 120 episodes included. so much included with this boxset... a must have for Batman fans.....",1416441600,,115,4.8
6504684,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I was not even born when ""Batman"" premiered on ABC in January, 1966, but I have always heard what a huge hit it was upon its debut on network television. After a disastrous beginning for the 1965-1966 TV season where none of ABC's new fall shows were hits, the network decided to premiere a new season starting the following January. The result was ""Batman"", based on the wonderful DC Comics of years past. The series was an immediate hit both with younger and older viewers and because the series aired twice a week (similar to ABC's ""Peyton Place) ABC would have two shows on the Top 10, ""Batman"" and ""Batman 2"".

 In early 1966 many television shows were still not airing in color because of high costs, but ""Batman"" aired a fresh breath of air to an already stagnant TV season by having its shows televised in beautiful color. This added to the realism and look of the show and it was like a comic book actually did come to life. ""Batman"" in its first season blew all the other shows out of the water and became a cult culture phenomenon!

 In this Limited Edition Blu Ray set you get all 120 episodes that look beautiful and they have never looked better! Much effort and time was spent to make the ""Batman"" episodes look their best because FOX Studio knew that the series has always been the most highly in demand TV series to get a new life on DVD/Blu Ray.

 There are also over 3 hours of bonus features including interviews, ABC television ads, a 44 deck of trading cards that are replicas of those put out during the original run of the series, a series guide book that deals with the synopses of the episodes including air dates, a cute batmobile replica, and so much more.

 Only 95,000 copies of this Limited Edition Set have been made and they are selling fast. There is also a DVD set of the series but many extras are missing. However, for those who are not able to get a Limited Edition copy  on December 16, 2014 ""Batman-the Blu Ray"" set will be released without the toy car and some other extras. This Limited Edition set, though, is the premiere set to own if your a true fan of ""Batman"" and of classic television shows.

 Simply put this is a MUST-OWN!!!!!",1416441600,11,2177,4.431077694235589

6504702,4,B00LT1JHLW,"Well, the picture quality is stunningly beautiful. The extras are lacking what previously released dvd/vhs offerings(and YouTube) and overseas seemed to have released prior.  The episode guide is nice, but only lists the villain, not the guest star.  The Adam West photo book images are small and usually cropped photos.  The Matchbox Batmobile is ok, not great at inner car detail.  The disc tray foldout books are cheaply glued trays already pulling away from the paper.  The boxed set design is neat. The two separated covers portions swing open outwards and close held by magnets!  Batgirl test film is there, screen tests for both Adam West & Burt Ward, and the 2 actors that didn't get the roles. Burt's test footage for his fighting skills is slightly edited from the footage I've got on another released dvd title. Now the biggest blow!  The set boasts it's uncut. That is mostly true, but so far many reports have found small instances where the original print wasn't used and the syndicated print was with slight trims in footage or audio.  Missing Next Week villain slides/Dozier narration is missing! One cut in Archer episode at end which has footage from Batman film and narration touting the new Batman arsenal of weapons, boat, cycle copter.  Riddler episode Hi Diddle Riddle opens to a panning of worlds fair w/ William Dozier narration..it's gone..so footage is intact.  But when I view the episodes in the West commentary PIP extras it's intact.  The episode with Marsha Queen Of Diamonds where she visits her aunt at the cooking school is missing. After fans have watched all 120 shows I'm sure more reports will come in. I have my TvLand original vhs copies and it will take time to compare footage to see how much has been actually lost in this release of supposed uncut episodes!  You will NOT see any behind the scenes, film stills, Batmobile detail, bloopers. Burt Ward And Julie Newmar have VERY brief appearances on the extras and no other guest stars comment.  The trading cards are vintage reprints but incomplete and actually kinda lame in quality. Some Batfans are outraged by the missing footage and are already contacting Warner Bros. to complain loudly and demand replacement discs be produced.",1416268800,19,2228,4.9093333333333335
6504703,5,B00LT1JHLW,"This is a must have for any Blu Ray collection! Superb quality of video and audio remastered. Sometimes watching this the visual quality makes me think it could have been filmed just yesterday. The price tag had me a bit skeptical at first, but upon starting the first disc all the skepticism drifted away as Batbliss took it's place. Worth every penny!",1416268800,3,353,4.709677419354839

6504707,5,B00LT1JHLW,"This review is for the Blu-ray Batman Limited Edition set.  I won't spend a lot of time reviewing the show itself because most people reading this are familiar with the show.  If you want the best quality ever likely to be available on home video, then the Blu-ray Limited Edition is it.  As this is the only announced Blu-ray release of the 1966-69 Batman series, any true fan of this series - however worried about the price - should just bite the bullet and buy it! The image clarity is nothing short of amazing.  The colors are vibrant and in HD, you can see details and even the textures of the fabrics in the costumes.  Unless you have watched these discs, it is safe to say you have never seen this show looking this good.  When I watched this series as a child, it was on a 19-inch B/W TV.  Seeing Batman in HD is the way it was meant to be watched.  Okay, I think I've made that point.

There are 13 Blu-ray discs in the set itself, and are at most 95,000 of these sets made.  12-discs contain all 120-episodes of the 3-seasons of the show.  The last disc contains special features.

Special Features are:

- Holy Memorabilia Batman! - A fun and fascinating look at a couple of huge collections of Batman memorabilia, and at a man who builds 1966 Batmobiles as his vocation.

- Hanging with Batman (A look at Batman in Adam West's own words.)

- Batmania Born - Building the World of Batman

- Bats of the Round Table - A round table discussion of Batman with Adam West, Kevin Smith, Phil Morris, Ralph Garman, and Jim Lee.

- Inventing Batman in the Words of Adam West (The first 2-episode story with video commentary by Adam West.)

- Na Na Na Batman! - a tribute to the theme song.  (enough said.)

- Bat Rarities!: Straight from the Vault (Includes the Batgirl pilot, Burt Ward's screen test with Adam West, screen test of Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell (who were also up for the roles of Batman and Robin), and a tribute to editor James Blakeley.

The set also includes an episode guide, The Adam West Scrapbook, a diecast Batmobile by Hotwheels, a repro set of 44 trading cards, and the box plays part of the Batman theme when a button is pressed.

Now, a few words about the show itself.  For those who didn't grow up watching this series, it is a comedy done in such a way that younger children took it seriously, but which adults can laugh at the deliberate absurdities.  I also like the Tim Burton films and the Dark Knight films.  For me, they are each separate entities existing in their own worlds.  As such, they shouldn't be judged against one another.  Is this Batman series silly?  Yes, but so what?  It's supposed to be.

I hope someone finds this helpful.

Update: November 22, 2014

Holy Blu-ray, Batman!  I have learned since I wrote my original review that this series will be available as an ""unlimited"" set on Blu-ray.  Depending on how prices compare when it is available, the Limited Edition may still be good (or better) deal.  The ""unlimited"" set has 13-discs (the same as the Limited Edition), but leaves out the scrapbook, batmobile, and trading card set.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00PVBCSNA

This set is scheduled for release in Canada on December 16, 2014, but the release date is not specified for the United States.

Happy bat-viewing and bat-shopping!",1416182400,19,3317,4.576530612244898

6504709,1,B00LT1JHLW,"I don't buy any movie unless I can stream it on my portable devices. Warner Brothers continues to try and force consumers to use their complicated Ultraviolet service, which isn't compatible with iTunes and doesn't work on Apple TV. I've waited years for the Batman collection.  I guess I'll keep waiting and/or buy it thru iTunes..without all the crappy extras and for less than $180.",1416182400,7,385,4.923076923076923
6504710,5,B00LT1JHLW,One of the best classic shows ever. Then the extras you get in this set plus on blu-ray great job cleaning it up and exploding on our TV. Adam West is such a great actor. Julie Newmar was a great actress as Catwoman not to mention very pretty MEOW. Just a great wonderful show for kids and adults.,1416096000,6,297,4.137931034482759
6504711,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Beautiful image and sound! The replica Hot Wheels Batmobile is a nice touch, as was the 'Press Here!' button on the side of the box which plays the Batman theme. Very cool, indeed. A long time coming, but this set was well worth the wait.",1416096000,4,238,4.311111111111111
6504712,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Holy puzzles, Bat-Fans, I can't get the second DVD out of the package!

So far I've seen the first DVD (great!), and I'm trying to dislodge DVD #2 from the case without breaking the disk!

Once I figure this out, the disks are going into practical sleeves, and the packaging cases will go into storage or garbage.",1416096000,5,313,4.473684210526316
6504713,5,B00LT1JHLW,BATMAN --- lives!!!  It's about time this fantastic show is on DVD/Blu-Ray/digital.  Looks like a marathon for me this weekend.,1416096000,4,127,5.3
6504714,3,B00LT1JHLW,"Wow, I have waited for years for these to come out legally on dvd and this set comes with a number of goodies including a digital code to watch them on anything that can access Ultraviolet...But don't expect much in that regard.

First off it's great to have them on dvd and the extras are nice considering the age of the series it's amazing that you're really getting anything at all.

But for the money you spend the Digital Code should work correctly and without having to sign up for a flixster account, which transfers them to your UV account...which then doesn't share them with your VUDU account and oh, by the way, you can by this series on VUDU, but you can't import your free copies...yet.

The quality of the video transfers look just like they do on a regular, non flat-screen television and at times I even get lines through the video as if I were watching it on a bad cable connection. Y'know those pictures of the color enhancements and remastering they've supposedly done to enhance everything? Yeah, well I've got the nice TV and DVD player and I'm not seeing any of that with this boxed set.

Take my advice and if you really want to get the complete series and save yourself the money and just by the regular, non-special edition set on standard DVD.",1416096000,7,1269,4.504347826086956
6504715,5,B00LT1JHLW,It is finally here. The full complete set in HD. The quality is awesome. I love that all the episodes come with HD Digital copy & play thru Vudu or Flixster.

6504717,4,B00LT1JHLW,"Disappointed!  Why wasn't any care given to this set?  While the episodes look the BEST they ever did, the series is missing most of the 'Next Weeks' and actual scenes from episodes such as in season two, when Aunt Hilda teaches cooking class in the Marsha, Queen of Diamonds episode (I also hear one of the John Astin Riddler episodes is missing a scene with a flashlight).  The BONUS FEATURES are dismal!  Instead of showing the GREAT stuff Kevin Burns assembled for his two disc HOLY BATMANIA DVD set, we are treated to fans of the show that I could care less about....talking about playing Batman when they were little, etc.  They cut Burt Ward's friend right out of his screen test (He is on the HOLY BATMANIA set) and Adam West is featured in everything BUT Burt Ward and Julie Newmar barely are.  Where are all the other great actors and actresses that appeared in the series?  Yvonne Craig comes to mind first!:  Van Williams, John Astin, Francine York, Sherry Jackson, Donna Loren, Joe E. Tata, etc.  Nowhere to be found on this set!  I am sure WB will be offering some kind of replacement disc thing BUT for $175, this should have been done right.  I am really tempted to send this entire thing back until they do it right.  Shameful!!!!  They should have hired Kevin Burns for this!  UPDATE:  Watched all of disc one from the 2nd season and not one NEXT WEEK....not even on the episode that always had the CLOCK KING Next week in syndication!  I made a phone call to the team that remastered the series in 1989 and all of the next weeks were present in separate cans.  The Next Weeks were part of the actual episodes, not commercials or promos.  Without all of these and the scenes that are missing, this IS NOT the complete series.  *UPDATE 02-10-2015  I got my two replacement discs and I am so glad WB did the right thing and put together some of the content that was missing.  I love having the pilot with the Dozier narration!  I love having all of the NEXT WEEKS together on disc one, along with the BAT ARSENAL promo from the ARCHER episode and the re-broadcast Next Week!  The HOME ECONOMICS ending of the Marsha episode was added and fixed on disc 2 of season 2 (It is also on the newly released DVD season 2 part 1).  It would have been nice to have the NEXT WEEKS with the episodes and better bonus material at the end of the set (That is why I raised my one star rating to four instead of five).  All in all, with the replacement discs, I am now very happy with the set :)  I do like the packaging and the series is among my very favorites!",1416009600,85,2563,4.3544303797468356
6504718,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Thank goodness that Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, and all other involved parties have finally sorted out years of feuding and red tape to allow fans to witness the majestic wonder of BATMAN on DVD & Blu Ray.  I was four years old the first time I saw an episode (Robin was being swallowed by a giant sinister clam) and it rocked my world in the same way that ""Star Wars"" would five years later.  As a child I believed in every outlandish word and scenario presented in BATMAN.

When the series returned to the air in 1989, I watched it with adult eyes and quickly realized the show was genius on every level.  The blinding Technicolor costumes, the over the top sets, and the zany comic book dialogue are only the beginning.  The true gems of the show are the actors.  Frank Gorshin (The Riddler), Caeser Romero (The Joker), and Burgess Meredith (The Penquin) have always received raves for their performances (and rightfully so), but the main cast is often ignored.  Adam West delivers his ridiculous lines (""What a way to go-go"") with such seriousness.  He plays it straight for the kids, but is secretly winking at their parents. And he is not afraid to look like a fool (The Batutsi dance or wearing giant bathing trunks over his Bat suit are just starters). Burt Ward's enthusiasm and energy as Robin is the perfect counter balance to West's slow paced observations and pauses.  Yvonne Craig as Batgirl adds an incredible level of sass and sweetness to the super hero team, and her theme song is awesome (""Who's baby are you"").  Neil Hamilton as Comissioner Gordon, Stafford Blake as Chief O'Hara, Alan Napier as Alfred, and even the narrator of the show all bring an abundance of talent and hilarity to their roles.  I can't possibly not mention my personal favorite, Julie Newmar as the sexy, slinky Catwoman.  She had to be the hottest woman on television before ""Charlie's Angels"", and she definitely had her competition with Jeannie, Samantha Stevens, and Ginger Grant on other channels.

Fortunately I owned taped episodes of BATMAN on VHS and was able to enjoy them many times over the years, but to finally have this amazing series in an officially released blu ray box set is something that I will be forever grateful for.  The picture and sound quality are immaculate.  The packaging is superb and almost as fun as the show itself.  The extras are also great (even though Yvonne Craig is completely absent and Burt Ward's participation is minimal).  My personal favorite is the Batgirl pilot, which has been available in bootleg form over the years, but now the quality is much improved.
The price may seem steep, but considering what a pivotal role BATMAN  played in introducing children of the 1960's and 1970's to the world of super heroes, as well as shaping their entertainment aesthetic, it seems worth it to me.  The show is something to cherish forever and to be shared and passed down to future generations as well.  Television produced many hip and cutting edge programs in the 1960's (""The Monkees"", ""Laugh In"", and ""Get Smart"" to name a few), but BATMAN is definitely at the top of the heap in my book.  If you love BATMAN even a fraction as much as I do, then you will not regret this purchase whatsoever.",1416009600,8,3238,4.695575221238938
6504729,3,B00LT1JHLW,"The quality is quite sharp and seems HD, but it's not format to fit the screen of your TV. It's more standard. Besides that, you get to relive your childhood with the complete series with some of the collectibles included in the boxset.",1416009600,2,236,4.511627906976744
6504730,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I received my numbered copy 11/13 wow!  I have been waiting all these years and I wasn't disappointed the re mastering and colors are amazing. It also is nice to see the whole show like it was originally released not with 5 min cut like on TVLand, nothing worse than watching something and notice a scene missing. Spend the money it is worth it. ARE YOU LISTENING PAUL HENNING ESTATE lets finish up the Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres now.",1416009600,5,443,4.5375
6504731,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Holy Bat DVD Robin!  Were back!
It was 2014, Nov. 12, and the moment had finally come.
I carefully took the DVD out of the pristine package, placed it into the blue ray player, and with the sound of Neal Heftis catchy theme song that taught a generation how to dance, came out of the TV speakers.  With stunning colour and sound, it could be 1966, and I could be three years old, impressionable and anxious to see Batman live!
In truth, it is 48 years later, and the impact is still the same.
Batman and Robin, straight from the DC comic book, in my living room.
When Batman first burst into living rooms across North America, I was three years old, and probably did not watch.  If I had done so, it would have been in glorious black and white, and I would have been wearing pajamas.
Im not wearing pajamas, but I am wowed by the quality of the 120 episodes that changed network TV, the effect of which is just starting to be seen today in Gotham, The Flash, the Avengers, Constantine, and the onslaught of Marvel/DC series and films assaulting our senses.
In addition to the three packs of individual seasons, two special edition books are included in the deluxe blu-ray edition; an episode guide, and an Adam West scrapbook.  Add the for promotional purposes only Batmobile, reproductions of a 44-card trading set, and the box that plays a snippet from the theme song, and you have a limited collectible edition worth waiting for.
As with any full series DVD limited edition set, there are extra documentaries on Hanging With Batman, Holy Memorabalia Batman, Bats of the Round Table, Inventing Batman, Bat Rarities and Na Na Na Na Batman.
Each of the extras makes the long wait worthwhile, and the watching more batlightful.
For those who live in the digital world, digital HD downloads are included with the set turning it into a Bat-ravaganza where-ever and however you view the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder.
Other versions of the TV series are also available without the extras.
As a Batfan since my early teens, all I can say is Holy Batman DVD!",1415923200,7,2052,4.598360655737705
6504732,3,B00LT1JHLW,"Well, it's finally here, only about ten years too late. And like the many escapes of our heroes in the show, it was just in the nick of time, because Adam West isn't getting any younger. Indeed, the level of his participation in this project is impressive, given that he's  in his mid-80s. Unfortunately, Adam West is pretty much all you get from the original cast and crew.

The prints themselves are excellent and titled as needed - we can put our bootlegs away at last. The bonus features are on one disk, and they are interesting and imaginative, particularly the round-table discussion with fans like Kevin Smith, and the visit to several Bat-collectors lairs. Adam West walks you through the pilot and provides a long interview.

And that's it.  You realize these extras were all put together in the past year, and there is no individual episode commentary (save the pilot), and no significant feedback from any other of the surviving actors. Granted there aren't many left, but the almost total lack of participation from Burt Ward and the complete absence of Yvonne Craig is puzzling.  Julie Newmar is also still around and she certainly would have provided some fun commentary to a Catwoman episode or two.

The collector box contains a matchbox car and a set of trading cards, a nice reminder of what we used to play with in the mid-1960s. There's a thin photo-book that isn't very good and then the disks themselves, packaged with good photos of the cast and the main villains.  It's obviously a must-have for those of us who have irrationally loved this show for decades. Just thank your bats they managed to get it done before West got too old, or there would be nothing other than the shows themselves. .",1415923200,10,1718,4.706666666666667

I picked this up on Tuesday when the doors opened at my local retailer and started watching episodes last night. The picture quality is fantastic. I like the box set and all the extras you get. I will be looking forward to seeing some of the toys, T-Shirts and paraphernalia that will be available soon.

Question: The box set plays the 'Batman Theme' song. Can that battery be replaced somehow and if not, how long will it last?",1415923200,,510,4.368421052631579

6504735,5,B00LT1JHLW,"WOW.  We only had to wait 48 years, but it was worth it.  They must have had to go thru some major hurdles to get all of the rights from the various artists who made this great show.  Worth the wait.  Just beginning my Bat Journey and loving every minute of it.  I have an unusual comment I think.  The Blu Ray definition is too good!  With the Joker you can see every pore in his face and the mustache of course.  The Penguins nose is so fake looking.  The capes of the crusaders look slept in in the first episodes.  These are not complaints, just observations.  Maybe I should record them on VHS tape and play them back on an analog TV to get that low def soft focus look I have been used to :-}
The entire package is first rate and I love the toy Batmobile and the look and feel of the entire set.  I guess from other comments that the DVD version does not contain the toy.  I have other sets from other shows which contain both the Blu Ray and DVD versions and they should have done the same thing here, since I won't be able to enjoy this in my car or other TV's in my house.
But, so glad to have this at last that I just say THANKS to all concerned.  So happy that Adam, Burt, and Julie are still around to enjoy the renewed BATmania!

6504750,4,B00LT1JHLW,"So let's first talk of price. On the average, a blu-ray with no extras runs about 24.99. There are three blu-rays in the special package, so there is $75 dollars right there. Add about $25 for the Batmobile and vintage cards (which I have the originals of) and the episode guide and small memorabilia booklets The extras in the package were not worth an extra $100. $99-$124.99 for this special blu-ray set would have been reasonable, but alas, Warner Brothers knew it would sell, especially to die-hard 1966 Batman fans.

Secondly, the quality of the picture and audio in HD blu-ray is outstanding. With the price, you also can put it on Ultraviolet for viewing online. All three complete and uncut seasons, plus the 3 hours of special features make this blu-ray something our grandchildren can watch without worrying about blood, gore, sex or ultra violence, just some biffs and pows. Great cameo appearances by actors who I thought would have never considered being on the show, but they proved that they could do campy as well as serious acting.

It is a great way to reminisce about how this show affected pop culture and the comic book industry. So, I would have given this box set 5 Stars, but I believe $99 to $125 would have been more appropriate a price.",1415836800,9,1264,4.6891891891891895
6504751,5,B00LT1JHLW,"...Get ready to take off with one of the most iconic TV shows in the history of the medium. After decades of waiting for an official home video release, Warner Bros'. Limited Edition Blu-ray set of the complete, 1966-68 BATMAN hip series delivers the goods to fans both old and new. Holy High Definition!

BATMAN was a huge cultural phenomenon throughout its three season run. Its sure-fire mixture of campy comedy, colorful, comic book action, and brilliantly eschewed characters has withstood the test of time as few pop-related things ever do. Adam West and Burt Ward came to personify the Dynamic Duo for audiences around the world, and despite more recent incarnations, theirs remain the definitive characterizations for many people. Contributing no less to the show's remarkable staying power are various villains ranging from Frank Gorshin's Riddler and Burgess Meredith's Penguin, to Cesar Romero's Joker and Julie Newmar's Catwoman, as well as a host of other Hollywood legends.  All of them added their own unique take on the arch criminal they played.

This eagerly awaited release features amazing, eye-popping quality on all 120 episodes that actually look even better than when originally broadcast. With the higher resolution output of today's TV's, we can now fully savor the sharpness and rich color saturation contained in the original 35mm masters. The experience is literally like seeing BATMAN for the first time, or at least like never before possible.

The extra features disc is a cache of enjoyable Batmania, including documentaries on Adam West, the show's origins, its influence on pop culture, and its lasting legacy. There's also a screen test of Burt Ward, as well as the rarely seen Batgirl teaser/pilot. Other items include a cool Hot Wheels Batmobile replica, an Adam West photo scrapbook, a 32 page episode guide, and a pack of 44 vintage trading cards.

To the bat-poles!

6504756,5,B00LT1JHLW,"After decades of political Hollywood back-and-forth, Dynamic Duo fanatics can now own all 120 episodes of the campy, colorful 1960s television show Batman. Theres no time like the 75th anniversary of one of DC Comics most beloved super heroes to release this literal treasure box. Batman: Limited Edition  The Complete Series is packed full of all-new bonus material and collectibles.

Millionaire socialite Bruce Wayne and his teenage ward Dick Grayson live the high life in stately Wayne Manor. They appear to live in the lap of luxury without a worry in the world, served by their gentlemanly butler Alfred and Aunt Harriett. Little does the rest of the world know that the two mild-mannered men secretly battle evil as Batman and Robin. In a city filled with all sorts of colorful super villains, they're armed only with utility belts full of technical gizmos and gadgets paired with their deductive detective skills and physical prowess.

Youve never seen this television classic the way you will viewing Batman: Limited Edition  The Complete Series. Presented in 1080p High-Definition, I doubt it looked as good when it first aired back in 1966. Its obvious from the clarity of the picture that quite a bit of blood and sweat went into restoring the original source material to deliver the highest quality video possible. The show was known for its colorful splashes of onomatopoeias and costumed heroes and criminals. It feels as if you're living in a comic book as the adventures of our Caped Crusaders spring into action on the screen.

By no means am I technologically savvy, but I was a little bummed that producers of Batman: Limited Edition  The Complete Series didn't supply an audio upgrade. It might not have been possible to bring it up to 5.1 surround since it was originally mono. However, I believe its been done before. We just get cleaned up Dolby Digital 1.0 audio here. It definitely sounds fine, but I still wonder what couldve been.

Batman: Limited Edition  The Complete Series is filled with over three hours of entertaining extras. Six featurettes cover everything from memorabilia to creating the world of the television sensation. Hollywood stars and producers reveal their favorite memories of the show and Adam West shares his experiences as well. Bat rarities are pulled out of the vault to parade in front of home audiences.

The set also comes with a few highly collectible items. One is a Hot Wheels replica of the Batmobile to display in your office or anywhere else. 44 vintage trading cards feature vibrantly colored illustrations of the Dynamic Duo battling their arch villains. The Adam West Scrapbook includes dozens of behind-the scenes and promotional photos with anecdotes about his experiences playing Batman. A detailed guide gives a synopsis of every episode accompanied with pictures and facts about some of them.

Batman: Limited Edition  The Complete Series is fun for the whole family. Your older kids might find it highly corny or get the joke if they were fans of Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Younger kids will appreciate it for the same reasons you did when you were a child. Its a fun, flashy, adventurous, and an all-around light-hearted good time for everyone. I love the dark and grim Dark Knight of today just as much as the next fanboy, but even super heroes need some time in the light once in a while.",1415750400,8,3368,4.9223985890652555

The picture is so sharp and clear. Looks way better than any other time I've seen the show on television.

I've seen that some people are complaint that it doesn't have English subtitles. They do In fact have English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

One of the most amazing things is that you get a code for a digital version of the entire show, and while it's through flixster ( a service I haven't used much lately) it's still a fantastic idea.

http://www.wired.com/2014/11/batman-home-video-finally/

...you'll understand the frustrating yet compelling truth of the delay that mentions the thousands upon thousands of personal dollars a person spent in an effort to see this release. Otherwise, neither 20th nor DC/WB would have budged, and this page wouldn't exist for you brats to whine ceaselessly. Now, on to an actual review of the set.

I started with season one disc one, and from that first scene in Moldavia, I could not believe how rich, deep, and clear the colors, the sharpness of detail and the great labor taken to restore this to such high quality. Even the stock footage used in episodes appears fresh and pristine. All subsequent episodes viewed (from various seasons) maintain the same standard of exceptional color, clarity, and sharpness. A lot of love went into this set, clearly (the audio has also been meticulously restored as best as possible considering the time and original source).

As for extras, they've left no stone unturned, with each featurette possessing substance and great information as opposed to lesser offerings from other series. Adam West's memories, presented through a fantastic scrapbook as well as generous interviews, audio commentaries, etc., show his abiding appreciation for the show, and as a fan, I'm so pleased he's still around to see this set and the happiness it will bring to generations of fans.

The packaging is equally impressive, with everything well contained, the seasons housed in separate, colorful box sets, and the published materials equally accessible.

To those who produced this, thank you for the measure of love for the series and respect for the fans that you poured into this. It's been a long time coming, but it was worth the wait. To the Bat mobile!",1415664000,86,2037,5.099099099099099
6504761,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Brilliantly executed release. After years of waiting for this release they have done it justice. Beautiful re-master, colors detail and just the right amount of grain to not detract from the production era. The Bat mobile replica comes in it on little clear box with a Gotham city back drop. The Adam West Scrapbook is of heavy glossy card stock and very nice to hold and look at. The episode guide is nothing special but it serves it purpose with every episode per disk and a brief synopsis of that episode.",1415664000,,508,4.593406593406593
6504762,3,B00LT1JHLW,"I was was hoping for a unedited Blu-ray copy but along with the other things omitted by others is another:

On the Riddling Controversey episode of John Astin as the Riddler, the scene where the Riddler is hiding behind the Commissioner's desk is omitted when he puts his ""pencil flashlight"" into a wall outlet.  I saw it back in the early 90's on WPIX synication.  It's a stinking shame people!!!

Edit:  I've been watching the rest of the episodes and there's been bits from each of the episodes deleted in this so-called complete-unedited Batman set.  Another one is the Riddler ""jig"" near the end of the 1st part of the Ring of Wax.  It only shows him hopping straight up, but during the recap of the 2nd part, you can see the whole thing which was on the sindicated version on the Family Channel in the early 1990's.  I think that WB better investigate and redo the sets.  That would be the least that it could do for their lies and deceptions.",1415664000,12,949,4.47093023255814
6504763,3,B00LT1JHLW,"Beware - 2 cuts found! Yes these episodes ARE gorgeously remastered to superb quality, BUT... I have found two unrectified syndication cuts as of this writing.

Cut #1 -  On the opening scene of episode 1 (Hi Diddile Riddle), while the camera pans over the Gotham World's Fair, there should be introductory dialog by series narrator William Dozier. I have this narration on my video tape copy I made back in the late 70's/early 80's from my local TV channel running it. Let me be clear, no scenes are cut, the dialog is just absent from the scene. This first vanished when new syndication prints were struck during the release of the first Michael Keaton Batman movie. At that time, the narration for the opening of episode two (the recap of the nght before) also vanished. You just saw a series of stills with no explanation. This was restored for later syndication (TVLand had it, MeTV currently has it) and it IS here on this DVD release.

Cut #2 is to be found on the first episode of season two (Shoot a Crooked Arrow). At the story's concluding cliffhanger, the scene fades out and then fades back in to a 20-30 second segment in which the narrator announces that beginning tomorrow night, Batman will begin unveiling his new arsenal of Bat weapons. The video accompanying this narration is comprised of scenes of the Batboat, Batcycle and Batcopter (which I believe were lifted from that summer's  feature film). I also have this on tape from their 70's/80's airing.

 You already have been told that the ""next week"" slides with Dozier's narration have been omitted, but what I find strange is that while one of them remains intact on the prints that MeTV runs, it is absent from this DVD release. The second season episode ""Ma Parker"" contains this preview announcing the unknown-to-fans-at-that-time villain Clock King will be Batman's next adversary.  Okay, all this is minor, BUT... it is major enough for me to return my purchase of the deluxe Blue-Ray collector's edition. I will instead buy the much lower priced red-ray DVD versions a season at a time.  Sorry Warner Bros, but a Collector's Edition must be PERFECT to truly be a Collector's Edition, else it's not worth the hefty higher price. Maybe someone can set up a website whereby fans can upload these missing end slides? I have 3 or 4 of them somewhere on my old tapes, including the longer one announcing the beginning of the second three parter (Penguin Is a Girl's Best Friend). So c'mon fans; let's unite to help out and make the Batman release that SHOULD be - the one the anal retentive fans (like myself) deserve!

P.S. - Of course there might be more cuts - I haven't watched every episode yet. I just looked for what I knew to be current cuts in the MeTV prints. Good news is one cut WAS restored. There's a short dialog scene missing on MeTV's print of Marsha, Queen of Diamonds that is now intact on the release DVD.",1415664000,78,2900,4.6484375

6504765,5,B00LT1JHLW,"After a nearly interminable wait, the late '60s classic, Batman: The Complete Series (starring Adam West and Burt Ward) is finally out TODAY on DVD and Blu-ray. Got my Blu-ray edition today and once I played it on my Blu-ray I must say I loved it. The colors are solid and the transfer was beautifully done as the remastering has restored the series with an eye-popping panache. The episodes seem to be uncut running at 25 minutes. Along with every episode from the series, there are vintage screen tests, photo scrap books, trading cards, and a Hot Wheels Batmobile replica. So they did it right! I have to say that Warner's Limited Edition packaging and swag are outstanding. This glossy and brightly-colored box is just gorgeous. The front is actually a magnetic lid with sturdy flaps that open left and right. Inside is a velvet liner with slots that hold the physical contents. Included on the right-hand side is a 4-inch long Hot Wheels replica of the Batmobile in its own plastic box. There are no moving parts other than the wheels, but it's still pretty awesome and nicely detailed. You also get a package of Batman collector's cards. There are 44 in all, and they reproduce a selection of images from vintage 1966 Topps collector's cards. This isn't a complete reproduction set - Topps produced black, red and blue-Bat sets totaling over 100 cards back in the day - but the 44 cards you do get here include some of the most classic art images. Then on the left side of the package is a larger slot that holds three full-season Digipacks plus an Episode Guide booklet (that offers a breakdown of the episodes on each disc with original airdates, plot synopsis, etc, and a list of the extras). Finally, there's The Adam West Scrapbook, which is a small hardcover book featuring rare photos and notes from West. On the inside of each lid flap, you'll find some familiar text - think ZOK! SWISH! POW! - in glossy black lettering on a matte black background. On each end of the box, there's a classic image of Batman and Robin scaling up the sides via Batrope. On the right side, there's even a little button you can press that plays a few seconds of the show's iconic Nelson Riddle theme song. Very nice. Finally, the set also includes a paper insert with a code that grants access to UltraViolet digital copy versions of all 120 episodes - another nice touch.

6504767,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I picked this up on release date at Costco... and after watching the bonus features have been bouncing around checking favorite episodes.  I know the troubles we have in the world, I've experienced the horrible economy as my fiancee has and I know a TV series being released on BR / DVD doesn't solve these issues.....  but as a ten year old when Batman first burst on the air in '66 .... this is a day I thought I'd never see and I can't express the joy in my heart, and the warm wave of nostalgia flowing through my veins.  This series was such a monster event in my childhood that having this now forever  makes this baby boomer unbelievably happy.  If I would consider deducting any stars it would be because I feel like they artificially jacked up the price knowing that I'm not the only person who would pay anything, but then again, I don't know how expensive this was to accomplish and sales of DVDs aren't what they used to be, so I refuse to deduct for price.  I also find that great care and love went into the stunning bonus features... which would off set that anyway..  If you want to return to the Batcave ... the same Bat Channel , the same Bat Time ... whenever you want..... buy now .....

I have to add that the episodes look spectacular and unlike other older shows where sets and pieces of art look stupid in the glare of HD ... it only serves to make the spectacle of this show more delicious. And the guest stars are a veritable whose who of acting legends .... all shamelessly hamming it up , chewing scenery, and enjoying themselves far more than they likely ever did in more ""serious"" acting gigs... and it shows this is so much fun!!!!",1415664000,24,1662,4.338709677419355

Update: I've noticed that some think I'm insane for thinking this is overpriced. If you're wealthy or nostalgic, more power to you. I know that this show had a hard time even getting a DVD release, but I still think WArner Bros. is taking too much money from you. Coming from someone born a few decades after the show ended, this really makes me avoid it and that's ashame. This looks like an enjoyable show for what it was.",1415664000,5,781,4.312925170068027
6504791,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Well, this could have been a hack job and fans of the 60's Batman TV series wouldn't have minded much.  We would have just been happy to have this series in any way possible.

But, I'm happy to report that Warner Brothers really spent the money and gave us fans the (mostly) definitive version of the series!  It looks absolutely fantastic, and for hardcore fans of the Adam West's Batman, please read on.

Ever since this set was announced, many fans were wondering what it would contain.  And while Amazon's description includes some of the details, it doesn't really get into the finer points.

Here's a list of what harcore fans of the series might care about:

1.  Yes, the Batgirl presentation reel/pilot IS included!  (This is the short, 10-minute film that was made to introduce the character to the network brass.). The picture quality of this film is not as good as the main series (with scratches and slightly faded color), but it looks better than what we've seen before, and it's uncut.

2.  The set also includes the test reels with Adam West and Burt Ward, as well as the film of Burt doing falls/breaking boards with his hand.  The picture quality of these films is quite good.

3. The two songs by Leslie Gore, and the two songs by Chad & Jeremy are where they should be in their respective episodes.

4. The episodes begin with the proper ""in color"" bumpers, and they conclude with the original 1960's 20th Century Fox Television logo.

5.  The first episode is sans the ""in color"" bumper (which seems to be correct for that episode), and its weird out-of-synch sound effects during the opening credits are all there, just like they're supposed to be!  (I had wondered if WB would have just used a standardized open credits sequence.  I was very happy that wasn't the case!)

On a negative note, all of the original ""next week's villain"" previews, which had been rumored to be included, don't seem to be there after all....  We do get a few, but it's frustrating that most were not included... (Warner Home Video fumbled the ball a bit in this regard, as the previews definitely exist, and can be seen at places like YouTube.)

All in all, this is pretty much the version of the 60's series fans were hoping it would be.  It looks absolutely incredible on blu-ray, and since WB got most of the little details right, most fans will be perfectly satisfied.",1415664000,361,2372,4.610978520286396

They did an excellent job remastering the episodes.
The colors are colorful.
First Season is the Best.  A+

Frank Gorshin is having the time of his life playing the Riddler.
He is a bundle of energy as he is hopping here, jumping there with his infectious glee of laugher.

Cesar Romero is also having a good time, cackling his way through a scene to bring mirth and mayhem.

George Sanders brings the right icy tone as the COOL Mr. Freeze.

Burgress Meredith brings the waddling master of fowl play, The Penguin, to life. Wielding an umbrella as only he can.

Julie Newmar is a sexy-seductive Catwoman willing to kiss you or give you a slash on the cheek.

It truly was a comic book brought to life by this excellent cast and crew.
Three cheers for everyone.

Yes, the BATGIRL pilot is included as a bonus feature. Although it wasn't remastered.",1415577600,14,866,4.571428571428571

I got my set early today and I am absolutely delighted with the sharpness and crisp images. The colors of this series were always vivid and thankfully they are vivid in this high definition Blu-ray release. I have watched several episodes already in a personal ""Bat-a-thon"" and they look utterly FANTASTIC. Also, I absolutely love the extras, the Hot Wheels Bat-mobile, the Adam West Scrapbook, the reproduction cards and the detailed Episode Guide. Also, when you push a button on the side of the box it plays the last part of the ""Batman"" theme as the show was going off. A lot of people were hoping it would have subtitles. Guess what? It does! I was pleased to learn it has them. There are cool bonus features too which I have not gotten to but I know they include the ""Bat-girl"" pilot with Yvonne Craig as well as Adam's and Burt's screen test along with Lyle Waggoner's screen test. This is the set I dreamed about for years. I know some people have complained about the price, and I get it, but there are other ways to get this set and discount places that will save a buyer a few dollars.

There are reasons it took this long.  Think about the investment they made in restoration and remastering from the original negatives.  Think about the amount of newly produced bonus features.

The show ran for 120 episodes, so that works out to about $1.45 per episode for the Blu Ray box set, plus you get all of the glorious extras including digital copies! When the remastered  Star Trek TOS came out on blu ray several years ago, those three seasons were priced at almost $100 each.

If you are a true fan of the show, you should be thankful that it is being released after all this time at any price. I know I am, and couldn't get my pre-order in fast enough.

6504799,2,B00LT1JHLW,"Ok, first let me say that this review is more about the packaging and PRICE, and not so much the content.  I grew up watching re-runs of this show as a kid and it is still fun to watch, even if it truly doesn't hold up to my childhood memory of the show.

My main problem with this is the PRICE!!!!  This needs to be $49.99 or less, not over $100.  C'mon man!

Also, I buy most of the TV shows I like and I have them in an organized DVD/Blu-Ray Shelf. Where the heck am I going to store this? The Box is not ideal for storing on a shelf, so I'll have to toss it in a closet somewhere away from my TV show collection.  The reason I still buy DVDs/Blurays is for the simple fact that Not all streaming services have the rights to a TV Show indefinitely.

So just because you can watch the Good Wife on Amazon Prime, Netflix or Hulu now, doesn't mean it will always be there when you want to check out an episode.  Having the Disc media allows me the freedom to watch a show without having to pay multiple times in iTunes, and there is never streaming lag.  Pop the disc in and no interruptions.

I just wish manufacturers would consider this when they decide to make a boxed set that doesn't fit on a standard bluray/DVD shelf.  It should at least have the standard case setup within the boxed set.",1415232000,10,1296,4.123505976095617

Trust me I've spent hundreds of dollars on box sets and DVD/Blu-rays but not this much at one time.

But what a shame and lack of leadership and foresight that they dragged their feet so long getting this out.  There's a bonus feature called na na (something or other) that has recollections of people involved with the show.  Unfortunately that's not too many people these days.  What a shame they didn't have the vision to get interview and commentary from the late great Frank Gorshin ( and why is his presence conspicuously absent from any of the press releases regarding this offering?!  He was only the first villain on the show, turned the Riddler into something it was not originally - - a major character in the Batman lore, and he was in the Batman movie.  But I digress). Burgess Meredith, Eartha Kitt and Vincent Price were alive a long time.  They too would have been fascinating editions to this release had someone had some vision.  It's things like that that irk me with the powers that be.  Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this a Warner Bros. property?

6504822,5,B00LT1JHLW,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this release? Well, let's remember back in the 60's and 70's each half hour show was at least 24-25 minutes an episode. What does the average T.V. episode run today? Most of them are 19-20 minutes an episode! Also, most TV seasons of today you get 6-13 episodes a season and they charge you $30. Back when Batman was made, they made about 38 episodes a season! That's a little bit more than your average show today! The biggest thing to remember when purchasing this blu-ray/DVD release is the total running time you get! This set says about 50hrs total running time, plus the special features! When people see that it's just 3 seasons, they automatically say to themselves ""That's not much!"" So when you think of it that way, it's really the same as buying 5-6 seasons of something currently shown today!",1411603200,10,856,4.601307189542483
6504823,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I knew I'd enjoy seeing these episodes again, but I had no idea how much more fun they are to watch as an adult.  I watched the show religiously in syndication in the 70s when I was a little kid.  But the syndication package had abbreviated versions of the episodes and put a select few dozen episodes into regular rotation, largely ignoring the rest.  So watching this complete set on Blu-ray I get to see episodes I'd never seen before or had only seen once and had only faint recollections of.  So it's nostalgia and discovery all in one boxed set.

I got through the somewhat short first season with a smile on my face.  But starting with season two the writing got a lot sharper and wittier.  I find myself laughing out loud at some gags and references I would never have understood in my youth.  Still have a ways to go, but I'm watching every day.

Warner Brothers was quick to ship the replacement discs for the episodes that had accidental content errors and omissions.  So I'm fully loaded and all set.

This set has been worth every penny I spent on it.  And I'm definitely glad I got the Blu-ray set.  Sharp color means everything in this show.

Actor James Brolin appears in an episode early in season two and he has the funniest lines in the entire episode.

But amid the multiplicity of iterations of the Batman, from Grant Morrison to Christian Bale and every errant Clooney in between, this take reached a massive audience outside the comics first, even moreso than the earliest film seriels.

(better journalists would hit 'Little Nemo' and 'Pogo' out of the gate and note, hey, maybe comics always were for everyone. This series is so of its time that it ends up relevant; I'll always remember Burt Ward's Robin looking at a passed out 'Batgirl' (so she would not remember the bat-cave's entrance), only to have Adam West's Batman look at the Boy Wonder and say, ""Think clean thoughts, chum.""

6504826,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I've heard a lot of yakking about the price, but lets consider the factors for that price. Throughout the series several stars made cameo appearances on the show, but WB does not own the rights to those appearances. So they have to purchase them (probably $100 of the cost per collection) then you have all those added extras: batmobile replica (not a replica of the batmobile toy but of the batmobile itself), vintage trading cards (44), photos from Adam West's own vault, episode guide with note from Adam West, and all that Batman artwork decorating the whole thing(probably $50 of the total price). The show itself is great. You get all 120 episodes in HD (it's about time) and with this set you could even download them to your computer. And lets not forget the special features:
HANGING WITH BATMAN. (A true slice of life in the words of Adam West.)
HOLY MEMORABILIA BATMAN! (A journey into the most sought-after collectibles through the eyes of three extraordinary collectors.)
BATMANIA BORN! (Building the World of Batman  Explore the art and design behind the fiction)
BATS OF THE ROUND TABLE (A candid conversation with Adam West and his celebrity friends, chatting all things Batman in '66.
INVENTING BATMAN in the words of Adam West (episode 1 &2)   A rare treat for the fans as Adam discusses his script notes on bringing Batman to life in the first and second episodes.
NA NA NA BATMAN! (Hollywood favorites stars and producers recount their Batman memories.) All these are probably $100 of the price. So, if I'm figuring this correctly WB is making about $20 profit per season. Not bad.

The main thing is, it's a collector's item. If you want it, you're gonna have to pay collector's prices. But, in my opinion, WB does not rip you off.",1410912000,15,1752,4.753289473684211

6504833,5,B00LT1JHLW,"BATMAN-THE COMPLETE TV SERIES: Campy, comic book-colorful and crammed with pun-ishing dialogue, the casting in BATMAN was absolutely inspired, namely ADAM WEST as our straight-laced intrepid hero and ""short-man's-syndrome"" originator BURT WARD's abnormally zealous, ""Holy (fill in the blank)""-spouting BOY WONDER. But the REAL fun/kitsch factor lay in the vivid, deliciously overacting arch criminals, from CESAR ROMERO's greasepaint no-goodnik JOKER to FRANK GORSHIN's hyperactively hilarious RIDDLER. Eternal character actor BURGESS MEREDITH made the waddling, cackling PENGUIN his most memorable role, while six foot goddess JULIE NEWMAR was absolutely put on this earth to don a skin-tight black catsuit and high heels. BATMAN's superhuman ability to resist her amazonian-dimensioned advances was far more impressive than the dozens of potentially lethal traps he miraculously escaped. A veritable ""who's who"" of show biz vets lined up each week for a crack at bad-guy infamy; VINCENT PRICE, LIBERACE, OTTO PREMINGER, MILTON BERLE, TALLULAH BANKHEAD, CLIFF ROBERTSON, VICTOR BUONO and SHELLEY WINTERS were but a few players in the nefarious rogue's gallery. On the good guy side, stand-outs included NEIL HAMILTON as the perfectly wooden, hopelessly naive COMMISSIONER GORDON...and where would the DYNAMIC DUO have been without ALAN NAPIER's loyal man-servant ALFRED? (undernourished, and in soiled bat-suits, I'll wager). Armed with the tricked out Batmobile, bottomless utility belts and over-the-top dialogue, what ultimately brought the DYNAMIC DUO down? That's easier than answering one of RIDDLER's cunning conundrums. The third season introduced the perky, high-kicking BATGIRL and a bevy of boring baddies like LORD FOGG, LOLA LASAGNA, and NORA CLAVICLE, while at the same time eliminating cliff-hangers and JULIE NEWMAR...reason enough to stop tuning in, ""same BAT-TIME, same BAT-CHANNEL"".

The official Blu-Ray release of BATMAN is crammed with a utility belt's worth of cool extras including a Matchbox replica of the BATMOBILE, 44 trading cards, an ADAM WEST scrapbook and behind the scenes documentaries...Holy Happiness!

This show only really made only 120 half hour episodes! Most people will go through the whole series within a month or two, and after they are done with it, they'll leave off with a feeling of emptiness, like they've been cheated, wondering why they went through all this trouble to make this tv show, only to cancel it so fast. Makes no sense! Thus, I conclude this should cost no more than $50.00 total!

Now, if this show actually ran about 5 years like it should have, I would gladly pay $300.00 for this set. But since this show only lasted about 2 years, incompetence should never be rewarded.

6504843,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I thought I would chime in on this just because I think it is odd that so many reviews have been posted for a product that has not been released. I don't mind the opinion reviews they have insight and are I understand a review of the series and not the actual DVD or Blu-ray set. The set its self cannot be reviewed because no one has seen it. What I don't understand is the 1 and 2 star reviews again no one has seen it. The majority of the low reviews are because of the price which has already dropped by almost a hundred dollars. Now priced at 179.00 on Blu-ray.

  I understand the frustration but most are blaming the studio for the inflated price. Accusing them of gouging the customer. If anyone has followed the history of this release they know the issues and problems that have caused the delay and the high cost. This is a series that had many stars involved, so many guests as villains and so many cameos. There are also music rights involved. All of these things add to the cost, in a since all of the stars, guests and musicians had to be paid off because in their contracts they all had a piece of the action. To further complicate things if any of the people involved had passed away the payoff would go to the estate and that could and did involve coming to an agreement with all involved in that individual estate, i.e. husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, divorced spouses and if they had passed etc... . in a few words a legal nightmare! Plus two different studios involved one owning rights to the series the other owning rights to the BATMAN franchise and DC Universe. Now I am not an advocate for any studios. I believe they are money hungry greedy people just like everybody else. But in this case I think that 179.00/134.00 is a fair price for a complete series. Would I like it lower yes but at this point for what you get even without the extras I feel it is fair.",1407283200,12,1891,4.32112676056338

I've seen the remasters, yes, they look nice, but it's so transparent how they are manipulating the fan base by making them buy their box sets by limiting the availability the way they have.
The only way to buy a complete series is to purchase one of the overpriced box sets... however, if you want to enjoy them in high def?  Then you have no other alternative but to plunk down a couple hundred bucks. Why not atleast offer other options? They would sell more units in the long run I'm sure. The people at Warner worked very hard on the restoration and they should be very proud of the end results. It would be nice for this long awaited premiere to see as wide a release as possible.
In the end, it is a possibility that WB is shooting themselves in the foot, as it will only encourage piracy.
The way I see it, they are making a cash grab at a highly sought after product and taking advantage of the fans.
I would have no problem buying the seasons over time, one by one, on the 'ray for a reasonable price. I don't need some trumped up fanboy package to dazzle my senses and lure me in to seal the deal.

This stuff was cool, funny and a joy to watch and look forward to receiving the box set.
I think the price is justified by how much of a fan of the series you are coupled with your nostalgia level towards the shows. I for one don't watch 90 percent of whats on TV at the moment ( because its no good) and most of my viewing pleasure is satisfied by the old shows, the classics, things that were great, but not around anymore.

6504856,4,B00LT1JHLW,"We bought this blu-ray box set and the first thing we noticed is the size of the box. It's MASSIVE! Half the box comprises of the discs, episode guide, and Adam West's scrapbook, and the other half has a plastic tray that holds a vintage (repo) deck of trading cards and a Hotwheels Batmobile. The rest of the box houses the audio device, when button pressed on the side, chimes the Batman theme. The Batmobile is kind of cool, if you're into toys, but the trading cards seem rather bland. The box itself seems unnecessarily large -- perhaps to match Adam Wests's ego. Though, nice and impressive at first sight, we're just not fans of oversized packaging.

The video is SUPERB! Truly re-mastered and looks like it was shot yesterday. This is the highlight of the set and the only reason to buy it. However, the sound is flat and appears they did nothing to improve the sound quality (I've heard remastered mono tracks on other products which are stunning). Haven't looked at the special features yet so there may be an update in the future.

I was hoping this set would have optional titles to turn on and off. I know the ""Pow!"" and ""Whoosh!"" is a huge trademark of the show, but it's obsolete and almost childish. The screen action titles distract from the filmed scenes and it's a shame that none of the actors ever complained about it (perhaps they did?). The show itself is the utmost of cheese and camp, and can only be watched in doses. Sure, it's a television classic and deserves respect, but it's hard to watch for lengthy periods of time without feeling like you're 12 years old.

This is not a 5 star set, but rather 4 stars seems appropriate. Again, the video quality alone is worth the weight in gold.

Let's now see The Green Hornet released!!!",1406678400,6,1759,4.539432176656152
6504857,5,B00LT1JHLW,"To all the 1 Star review naysayers moaning about the price of this set.

Consider the following.

At the current Amazon price of $190, the cost of the set averages out at around $1.50 per episode and that is before the 3+ hours of bonus video material and other extras are taken into account.

The 1966 Adam West 'Batman' movie on Blu Ray has an average online price of approximately $10 for a 100 minute running time and no one is complaining about the pricing.

Therefore why then is $1.50 per 25minute TV episode on high definition Blu Ray ($6 per 100mins) suddenly a ridiculous price?

This is a 120 episode set.  Three full seasons.  Plus extras.  On Blu Ray.

Some people really do want something for nothing, don't they?",1406592000,26,727,4.530769230769231
6504858,5,B00LT1JHLW,"If it's 720p, might as well get the DVD and skip the car toy. The show was most probably recorded with film (what else was there at the time?), so it's very possible that it'll be 1080p.",1406592000,3,186,4.054054054054054
6504859,5,B00LT1JHLW,Just finished my first ever pre order. This Batman is definitely worth the pre order. Hopefully it will go down in price but 189 is better than 269.

6504860,5,B00LT1JHLW,I'm ready!!! Been waiting forever. I really can't fault anyone complaining over the price but hello!!!! this is so ridiculously overdue and I'm sure we're paying for various rights from comics and all that jazz. And try to find anywhere in this universe unedited complete eps. I'll still hope it goes below the $190 price but nothing will stop me from getting this. :D,1406505600,5,368,4.765625
6504861,4,B00LT1JHLW,"Honestly, I was absolutely expecting this set to cost $200 to $250 due to the longtime legal disputes regarding the rights to this (Fox owned the TV show rights but WB owns the Batman character).  I can't imagine just how much it cost WB in the end but it couldn't have been cheap.  So, the $190.00 price tag is actually pretty reasonable for this set when all of the facts surrounding this sets release is considered.

The $190.00 price point for this set breaks down to $63.33 per season.  That's not steep at all considering that other complete restoration sets (Like Star Trek: TNG) cost about the same, if not more, per season, and they don't come with nearly as many bonus features/items as this set does.

The last thing to consider about this set is that it's listed as a ""Limited Edition"".  For those who don't care about getting the Hot Wheels Batmobile, the trading cards, etc, I'm certain that they'll release a ""Regular Edition"" Blu-Ray in the $120.00 range down the road.  Not to mention that, for the patient, prices are sure to drop over time.  This set is clearly for the hardcore fans (like myself) that really don't have the patience to wait for a price drop.  :-)

The only downside that I see to this set (and the only reason that I rate this 4 out of 5 stars) is that it doesn't look like there are any audio commentary tracks for any of the episodes (unless they simply haven't released that info yet).  I think it would've been nice to get some commentary tracks from Adam West and Burt Ward on at least a handful of episodes.

Also, some of the bonus features that are listed in this set seem a little weak.  For instance, the feature where they have random celebs talk about their favorite Batman moments seems like a waste of time for me.  I honestly don't care what celebs think about Adam West's Batman.  But, perhaps I'm alone in that.

Other than that, I think that this looks like a fantastic set.  It's far from a bare bones release and WB has done right by the fans by completely restoring the episodes.  Considering all of the legal issues that surrounded this series for so many years, it was long thought that this show would never see the light of day.  So, the fact that this set is even being released is something of a miracle.  Considering all of that, the $190.00 price tag will be well worth the cost.",1406505600,13,2345,4.447306791569087
6504862,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I highly suspect one of the reasons the retail price on this set is so high is because it must have cost a FORTUNE to finally settle the decades-old dispute between Greenway Productions,20th century-Fox and Warner Brothers. It also cost a fortune to properly restore 120! episodes of the show, plus all the extras! And I mean EEXXXTRAAS!
This week was the first public showing of clips from the show at the San Diego ComicCon. STUNNING is the least you could describe the quality. You can see every detail from the glue that affixes Julie Newmars claws to her cat-glove to finger prints on the batmobile. Viewing these shows will be a whole new experience of fun. I suspect millions of bootleg versions of this series will be lining trashcans and baking at garage sales.

The Only thing I'll add are these two things: People, quit complaining about the price!! Fox and Warner Brothers had to untangle their legitimate legal beefs with each other over the rights to the Batman character, allies, villains, etc., and then both companies had to get the rights fixed when it comes to the guest stars, cameos, music, and so on.

Second, the first season is being sold for about $40 which is pretty fair so you can wait for the other seasons to come out.  We've been waiting for this forever.  Remember, this show wasn't even on VHS so this is really a big deal.  This show is not just a piece of Batman lore but also a piece of '60's lore.

I am so thrilled to see this is finally being released on DVD. I was a toddler when this series originally ran but caught it in re-runs. With all the legal battles, I thought the day would NEVER come so when I heard this release was in the works, I FULLY expected to pay premium for it.  Having said that, I took advantage of AMAZON's Pre-Order price guarantee and ordered immediately and have already saved some bat-bucks.

Getting the Hot-wheels replica of the Bat-mobile is a nice surprise - but being able to pretend to be BatGirl again -- ahhhhhh PRICELESS!",1406246400,138,5946,4.467652495378928
6504877,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I attended the Comic-Con panel on July 24, 2014, which featured Adam West, Julie Newmar, and Burt Ward, as well as clips from the Blu-ray release and information on extras. I can confirm that the Limited Edition Blu-Ray will include never before seen photos, a Hot Wheels Batmobile, and several featurettes on the disks.  The episodes themselves look gorgeous--scratches cleaned up, colors corrected, modest sharpening done.  At the split screens showing the old TV broadcast vs. the new Blu-Ray, the improvements were stunning.  This will be a ""must-own"" for physical media.  Episodes will be complete and uncut. They even showed cameos by Dick Clark, the Green Hornet and Kato, and Bill Dana as Jos Jimenez. Fans will not be disappointed.

UPDATE:
Here's an update on the set after actual delivery:
The Blu-ray completely lives up to the picture quality shown at Comic-Con.  Colors pop off the screen, the image is sharp with no annoying noise or grain, even in dark scenes.  For example, you can make out when Batman needs a shave, the natural grain in Batman's cowl, even the ragged threads of Batman's cape.  For the first time, I noticed that Batman's ""ears"" are a different color than most of his cowl. Simply amazing.

Because the original show was not wide screen, on modern HDTVs, you can expect black bars on the side of your screen.

The seasons are individually-cased, and each season has disks that are color-coded, so you won't accidentally mix up the disks.  Special features are on the last disk in the Season 3 set.

I can also confirm that the ""Batgirl Pilot"" is included in the special features, under the section entitled ""Bat Rarities! Straight from the Vault"".  Also included there are Burt Ward's screen test with Adam West, Screen tests of Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, and a tribute to James Blakeley, production manager on Batman and The Green Horner.

The Batgirl Pilot is not re-mastered, so the colors are faded with scratches and other defects visible.

The included Episode Guide is okay, but while it gives a short description of each episode, lists the villain, original airdate, writer and director, it doesn't list the guest star(s) for each episode.  The actors playing the villains are named only the first time they make an appearance in an episode; subsequent episodes only list the villains name, which is fine unless you have to want to view a later episode and can't remember which actor is playing the villain.

This set is exactly what it was promised to be--the best color, the best imagery, the most complete set of the Batman TV-series ever.  It's the pinnacle of what Blu-ray was meant to deliver.  Gripe about the price, but it's well worth it if you love Batman and have a high-definition set.  Five stars.",1406246400,365,2759,4.867237687366167
6504878,3,B00LT1JHLW,I only give it 3 stars because this set is not even released yet. I will revise once I have watched every element of the UNRELEASED set and promulgate an unbiased opinion.,1406246400,,171,4.375
6504879,1,B00LT1JHLW,"One thing that I always find perplexing is gushing customer reviews for a product that has not even been released yet. I imagine the high marks being given this not yet released set are more reflective of the excitement about the long awaited release of the episodes. However as a long time fan and collector of Batman 66 memorabilia and items, I'm unimpressed by this ""limited edition"" offering so far. From the lack luster cover art to the lack of real ""extras"" content, at this point I see very little justification for the price. The cover of the Blue-ray is a photo-shopping together of two separate pictures of Ward and West. That individually are likely some of the most boring ever taken of them. At least the image of the duo on the DVD is some what more dynamic. However Ward looks as if he is about to fall into a nap. I find the cover packaging for both products a tad stale.

The first troubling sign was the 480dp ""trailer"" which ballyhooed this ""High Definition"" release. What better way to do so than with a 480dp trailer? So far this Blue-ray/DVD release just looks like something that was dashed out, even though it took over 40 years to get the product on the market. In the age of ""branding"" this packaging is the best the powers that be could come up with? I love Batman 66 and am not afraid to spend a little cash in pursuit of that passion. I spent more than the price of both the Blue-ray and DVD on the Hot Toys premium figures last year. As a long time collector of Batman items, there really is nothing that comes with this set that is not already available as an extra. Certainly not the Hot Wheels Batmobile that sits on many shelves at Walmarts all across the country. I'm hopeful that the transfers and remastering of the film to digital will be spectacular and impressive. Pre-ordering such an expensive set before we even know how it performs seems foolish to me. I'll await a more reasonably priced non ""limited edition"" version of the series and technical reviews of the audio and video quality, as well as dare to hope that set will at least feature a more creative packaging design than this milquetoast effort.",1406246400,39,2148,4.5218508997429305

6504886,4,B00LT1JHLW,"This was a fun show with an original approach.  It started out with a two-part cliffhanger format with each 30 minute part shown on two consecutive days during the week. Each episode had a different villain of the week broadly played by familiar actors (Ceaser Romero, Frank Gorshin, Burgess Merideth, Julie Newmar, etc)who seemed to completely enjoy their involvement in the series.  There was cartoon violence and choreographed fight sequences with ""pow"" and ""bam"" printed across the screen in comic book fashion. Their were gimmicks (the batpoles, the bat-computer, Batman's utility belt) and catchphrases (Holy ""fill-in-the-blank"")and of course the Batmobile. By the third season, the format changed to one 1/2 hour episode a week.  The cliffhanger element was dropped and replaced with an appearance from next week's villain at the end of each episode.  For better or worse, the character of Batgirl was also added in the third year.  By this time however, the novelty of the show was wearing thin and the show was cancelled at the end of the season.  Still, this is a cult classic and true fans would certainly enjoy owning all the episodes here.",1406160000,4,1152,5.068783068783069
6504887,3,B00LT1JHLW,"Oh well, too bad they're so greedy.  Just hold on and wait for the price to drop.  Remember how expensive The Man From Uncle, Get Smart, and 6 Million Dollar Man were when they first came out? Prices were astronomical.  Now you can get Get Smart seasons for $9.99 each... Man from Uncle the compete series sometimes dips into the $90 range and Million Dollar Man $11-$12 for the early seasons.  Same thing for this.... we've been waiting for years, what's another year or so?  Let's face it, most all of us already have them from ""other sources"".  So when the price is reasonable then I will bite on this set.  Look how much Star Trek the Original Series Blu Rays have decreased in price lately!!  Same thing for Twilight Zone Blu Rays!  Over the years we've all seen these shows many, many times.  There's no rush.... they held off releasing Batman 1966 for years.  What's another year or two make? Don't allow yourself to be gouged.... just be patient.",1406160000,12,954,4.552941176470588
6504888,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Holy Batmania, bat fans! It's official! To understand the importance of this DVD set... A few years ago a number of blogs took polls and asked fans of classic TV what programs have not yet been released to DVD that fans are begging for. THE WONDER YEARS, WKRP IN CINCINNATI and BATMAN were among the top three. This year, 2014, those goldmines are being excavated from the Batcave. Of course, many of us knew it was being released on DVD not because official BATMAN (TV series) merchandise, of recent, has been released to the market, but celebrities were leaking advance word. Months before Conan O'Brien leaked word that BATMAN was finally coming out on DVD, and Warners had to confirm (but could not provide a street date at the time), Julie Newmar (CATWOMAN herself) was at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Maryland in September 2013. When asked during a Q&A panel on stage why the BATMAN TV series had not yet come out on DVD, she remarked, ""I wouldn't know since I don't own the property... but I can tell you that I recently recorded audio commentary for many episodes for an upcoming DVD release..."" And the fans in the room shouted and cheered. (Just took that quote from the DVD of her Q&A session at the show so it's verbatim.) Many in attendance then announced what they had heard and posted on Facebook and Twitter but like anyone posting such news, it was assumed to be gossip... until Conan O'Brien helped make the announcement ""official.""

Adam West and Burt Ward since acknowledged participation with the DVD release (original filmed features AND audio commentary) and this set is supposed to be LOADED with bonus extras. Screen tests, audition films, bumpers and promos... you name it. Yes, the bumpers and teasers are also included!

The only question that still remains: legal holdouts always prevent certain purifications. Are all the music cues and scenes going to be intact? Remember that WKRP IN CINCINNATI years ago came out on DVD (Season One) with most of the music replaced and fans were angry. But every music cue had to be licensed and paid for... and each song licensed causes the price of the DVD release to go up. It was confirmed at the Nostalgia Convention that music will be intact including a song sung by Lesley Gore (in a Catwoman episode) which was not included in the TV reruns. The episode aired, but not the musical sequence. TV reruns, by the way, work under the original 1960s contracts and the terms of those contracts are perpetual. For DVDs, new contacts have to be signed and there's usually someone who thinks they don't have to sign unless they are being promised millions. So if you are shaking your head and questioning why the expensive price for BATMAN, remember that the more expensive the set -- the more complete, intact and uncut the series will be on DVD. It's the only way. 500 people can complain about the price, but this is a scenario where you get what you pay for. Also confirmed at the same convention (and this was all official) was the studio's insistence that rather than work with the old prints used for syndication all these years, the studio went back to the original masters (uncut masters) and did a new lab transfer to ensure the picture will be the best available anywhere. That costs money! (CBS cheapened when they released seasons 10 to 12 of HAWAII FIVE-O and they were obviously not from the original masters -- video quality was a major difference). Even TV reruns today will not have the superb picture and sound quality the DVDs will offer. Most Bat fans have stated that they don't mind paying more for a perfect set. And after all, isn't that what we want? Amazon.com also promises the lowest price so if the price lowers between now and the November release, you'll pay less when they charge your card in November and mail you your set. So ignore all the rumors, and the talk, talk, talk involving price complaints or folks ""questioning"" what bonus extras will and will not be in the set before it is released. All of the above is definite. It's why I bought two sets. One for myself and one for my nieces and nephews for Christmas.",1406160000,154,4129,4.670329670329671

6504891,1,B00LT1JHLW,"Evidently my previous feedback was deleted, I'm not going to rehash the whole thing.  I give the show itself a ""5 star"" rating. I give Warner Brothers Inc ""1 star"" for the ridicules price. This item was priced originally at 270.00, the price has since dropped to 179.00, and will probably drop even more prior to release - I'm assuming a sales tactic to drive up demand. If people (fans...?) would stop paying ludicrous amounts of money for so called ""collector's / limited"" editions, WB would probably stop inflating the prices so high, and capitalizing on consumers any way they can. WB is also famous for ""double-dipping,"" releasing a popular movie or TV show only on DVD, then 6 months later on Blu-ray, and then a year later ""complete / collector's / limited"" editions. Personally, I've wasted enough money already upgrading my Warner Bros / Disney titles to Blu-ray (and never once offered any incentive to upgrade). For as long as I've waited for this series to be released (what 30 yrs?), I'm sorry but I refuse to pay more than 90.00 for the complete series (Blu-ray). If they had launched a standard Blu-ray release at a reasonable price, I would have pre-ordered it by now. Even the complete series on DVD is at a ridicules price, who the **** is buying DVDs anymore anyhow?

C'mon WB...we love the entertainment, willing to pay for it no less, but be reasonable. These titles are meant to be enjoyed by everyone, through generations...not just a select few with completely disposable incomes.",1406073600,31,1504,4.803088803088803

I am absolutely going to get a good label maker and label every item in my garage now, just as Batman did in the Bat-Cave. This show has funny villains, needlessly complex traps, ludicrous escapes, and hilarious answers to riddles. (A sparrow with a machine gun!) Don't forget the over-the-top announcer! ""Is this the end for the dynamic duo?!? Tune in next week!"" Also, the glaringly obvious plot holes: why didn't any of these supposedly super intelligent arch criminals just SHOOT Batman, or take his mask off next time they had him trapped? I know it's supposed to be a light hearted show, but you can snicker and ask yourself that question as some criminal has Batman in a trap that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and then leaves before he dies, rather than just shooting him. Also, Commissioner Gordon must be a moron, not to recognize Bruce Wayne and Batman have the same voice, not to mention Alfred answering the Bat-Phone. But, since Batman is a campy show, its weaknesses can also be seen as humorous strengths.",1406073600,10,1186,4.679425837320574

6504899,5,B00LT1JHLW,"Holy Underwear!!! Innocent women and children blown to bits!!! Gentleman, we do something about this immediately immediately...  Finally The one TV Show That I've waited for since my 8 year old hand touched The Batmobile at a bank in Westminster, CA  back in 1966. And in glorious Blu-Ray!!!Blu Ray is the only way to view this T.V. Masterpiece!! Julie Newmar remastered and in blu ray.
There is a God..All the episodes. I may need to see a chiropractor  and have my neck readjusted after viewing The Riddler, Joker, Catwomen and The Penguin on a  20 degree angle for long periods.
I'm hoping the extras will along the lines of screen test, gag reel, commercials. Maybe something about the construction of the Bat Cave. Maybe Ms Newmar had a wardrobe malfunction or two. Cant wait for November. I've pre-ordered mine.
On a side note. I recently purchased Season 1 of The Monkees. And in the Episode titled: ""Monkees Blow Their Mind"" Burgess Meredith has a cameo as ""The Penguin"". He's in the 2nd half of the episode....I didn't get a hurumph out of that guy",1405987200,5,1057,4.728260869565218
6504900,5,B00LT1JHLW,"I had very little hope this would ever be released. Due to decades old legal disputes involving producers and studios this popular TV series missed the VHS, laserdisc and DVD eras. When so many 1960's TV series had no problem making it to home video.
TV reruns look terrible in terms of image quality. I'am sure that Warner will do a great job restoring this almost 50 year old films and make sure they look better than ever. I once read that DC comics was against bringing this TV series out on video since their campy nature wouldn't fit the image of later versions of Batman.
In the mid sixties we had several entertainment phenomenons that enjoyed huge popularity. This are beatlemania in music,Bond on film, the Ford Mustang in transportation and Batman on television.
To the younger people that hate this version of Batman I ask them to ignore it's release and let it's fans enjoy them as they wish.
I'am sure that as the release date approaches; the price for this set will come down also.",1405987200,12,996,4.601123595505618

6504902,5,B00LT1JHLW,"WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  This is (arguably) THE home video release of the year.  It's a stupendous collection, so well put together with a lot of fun extras and blu quality that allows you to see these shows in a (literally) entirely new way!
Stop all the kvetching about the price. Consider what other (somewhat comprable) shows go for a complete set...THE PRISONER for anywhere from $124 to over $200, WILD WILD WEST for $75, PETER GUNN for $50+ (and they all have considerably less episodes). MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. goes for $135-$200 for the complete series.

Frankly, ALL are worth it and so is the price for BATMAN.",1405987200,10,616,4.685185185185185

I give it five stars because this is something I've been waiting for for a long time.  Also the fact that Adam West and Burt Ward  are still alive and well and we're able to participate in the project.  I look forward to reliving a huge part of my childhood, and viewing the extra material I've never seen before.  I've preordered my copy and can't wait until November!",1405900800,7,464,4.325581395348837

6504906,1,B00LT1JHLW,I can't justify the price. Maybe if they did it season by season and I could spread it out over time. or just get the first (and best) season. But I can't pay $200 for a tv show. Not when Me-Tv re-runs it for free every Saturday.,1405900800,27,229,3.893617021276596

6504912,5,B00LT1JHLW,Batman 1966 was my favorite show when i was a kid i would watch the reruns over and over again. I didn't care but i still watch today just like all of the batman fans out there so now i can finally watch them in HD blu ray.  Without the commercials. Plus you get a bonus disc and a batmobile plus topps a set of 44 cards that was topps cards from the 60s. So this limited edition is for the batman fans so to the batphone.,1405728000,,422,3.8505747126436782
6504913,5,B00LT1JHLW,"People seriously need to wake up and realize that you can't get a Blu Ray series for cheap. Most season sets go for like $50.00 a piece. Take a look at Star Trek season sets as a example. This also happens to be a Limited Edition. In MOST cases this means that the set will be on sale for a few months to usually 1 year before it goes out of print. Or what can also happen is that this set will sell out on the first day. Usually people will buy multiple sets and then sell them for a profit. People will then panic and pay double the price for what it's going for now just to get the series. I'm hoping that it will sell out and Warner Bros will make more. It might be hard to get for a few months and later on the hype will go down. But we need to think about all possibilities for this set.

A lot of people don't realize the effort being put into putting this series onto Blu Ray. Fully restoring every episode isn't a piece of cake. Plus all the royalties evolved with this as well. Paying all those special guest appearances and such. A lot of you guys need to be grateful that we are finally getting this at last instead of already complaining about it because of the price. Why not wait and find out later on if it's worth the price... I already know it's worth it from what some of the features talked about in articles. The set will have a new reunion QA session on the Discs, probably stuff like Behind the scenes. They already said it's going to be fully loaded with features.

My review will be updated once Comic Con Int panel reveals more about this. I will also update more once I have the set in my hands and finally watching it.",1405728000,14,1646,4.108695652173913
6504914,4,B00LT1JHLW,"Looking very much forward to this release, but the price is a bit outrageous, even for a painstakingly remastered Blu Ray set.
