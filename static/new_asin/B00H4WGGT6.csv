8630004,5,B00H4WGGT6,SO GOOD! and MUCH better than the english produced version 'Humans' which is so shallow compared to this - it totally misses the mark. This one is MUCH darker and deeper ...,1521849600,,173,4.4375
8630005,5,B00H4WGGT6,"So much better than the UK version but I think some of my praise comes from watching the entire UK version first. It's like reading a book and then watching the movie based on it. You are already familiar with the characters and basic storyline.

But WARNING !! Unless you understand French or Swedish, and you can change your DVD player to region 2 playback, don't buy this if you plan on buying the season 2 DVD. For some odd reason season 2 is pressed in region 2 format, and there are no English subtitles.
What a shame.",1514332800,3,524,4.346938775510204
8630006,5,B00H4WGGT6,"Great to see the original series! It's very intriguing - and also a good backdrop for the US series ""humans""",1494720000,,108,4.45
8630007,5,B00H4WGGT6,"I must admit that I've only seen the first two of the ten episodes. But I think that viewers of the British ""Humans"" will enjoy this. A positive: A bit of nudity. A negative: You have to read sub-titles. Overall a very good series so far.",1494028800,2,238,4.195652173913044
8630008,5,B00H4WGGT6,Outstanding. Enjoy the plot and production. Waiting for season two. Highly recommended,1491696000,,86,6.25

8630010,5,B00H4WGGT6,"This is a truly exceptional production. Fantastically well-written and well-acted, Real Humans depicts a not-too-distant time in which androids are commonplace in society. In such a time and society, there could exist a human reaction no one may have quite expected. This series explores that, and does so with remarkable believability. Five stars aren't enough. I only hope that season 2, with English subtitles, is soon forthcoming.",1470873600,9,434,5.492537313432836
