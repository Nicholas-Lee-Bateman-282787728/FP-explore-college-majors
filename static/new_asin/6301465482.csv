To bad that Amazon doesn't let their buying customers have full access to ALL of the items that they had purchased through the years! Because in 2009 when I got my 1st. computer/acer laptop. I found a seller on amazon who put all of the D.D. cartoons on dvd which was about 7 out in one case. Somewhere in my dvd cartoon collection I have this,But in all of THE HUNDREDS of items that I had bought from them. This one is NO where 2b found scrolling through DOZENS of pages of items that I had bought..So in saying this only the vhs version of this tv cartoon from 1959--1961 is available anymore and getting LESS & lesser everyday!!",1480204800,,789,4.427586206896552
