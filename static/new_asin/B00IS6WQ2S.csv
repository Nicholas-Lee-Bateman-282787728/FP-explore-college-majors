6290415,4,B00IS6WQ2S,"It ran for 23 episodes during 1967-68 and was CBS's response to ABC's 7th season of hour and a half Wagon Trains and NBC's long running The Virginian (1962-71). Like Gunsmoke, Cimarron Strip is the story of a United States Marshall (and friends) trying to keep the west crime free. Both programs were produced at CBS Studio City and have a similar look, right down to faded film and murky color. I expect CBS will remaster the elements of the color Gunsmokes, as they have with earlier seasons, when they release them to DVD; Cimarron Strip is in desperate need of restoration too. The stories themselves are great, including one written by Harlan Ellison about a beast that slaughters men and cattle alike, and the guest stars and direction are top notch (again, utilizing talent from the same pool as Gunsmoke). Cimarron Strip is a big western.",1394323200,23,846,4.761904761904762

6290439,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"The strongest effect of this series is its rejuvenating energy. You experience it in the saddle with Marshal Crown. He rides down into each episode like you have never seen any cowboy ride. It takes your breath away. And when the distance swallows him up you feel a living force of nature disappears.  (Fortunately, he returns to enter each of the 23 feature-length episodes.) If you enjoy being jolted into a living experience of the raw west you might find you come out of it stronger than you went in. I've lost a good thirty years in this Cimarron Strip with Stuart Whitman and all the good, bad and ugly surrounding him. A special word for Jill Townsend as Dulcey: she is the measured pinch of spice that gets a rise out of every one who meets her, I imagine.
Not to ignore the primary storytelling masters of the scripts: they are hands-down top of their game. Musical Score by Maurice Jarre will stay with you as a tender sweet reminder of how alive we still are.  Go on , give yourself a good jolt. Live it.",1473811200,,1015,4.422459893048129
6290440,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"One of my all-time favorite westerns on TV when I was a kid. This show came on when I was 9 years old and already a BIG fan of westerns. Marshal Jim Crown was THE man for me back then and I even still remember falling in love with Dulcey (Jill Townsend) even at 9 years old. The girl was a stunner for me back then and you just didn't cross Marshal Jim Crown because, payback ... well, you know. I wish they still made TV shows like this now but at least we have the DVDs to fall back on. Great memories of this series as a kid and to this day, still a favorite of mine.",1473465600,2,570,3.8389830508474576

6290443,4,B00IS6WQ2S,"I have just finished the third disc, and am surprised how good this series is. Dulsey provides eye candy, while Marshall Crown provides quite a bit of being unpredictable. In fact unpredictableness I would say is this series strongest suite thus far. In The Search, for example, the last two minutes there had at least two unpredictable actions, which it's timing is even more a surprise, because most series of any kind are just wrapping things up instead at the end.

So far this third disc has provided my two favorites episodes, that being The Search and Whitey. IMO, the video is in pretty good shape, however the series does do some odd things at times, such as having night scenes that are so dark you can't see anything. It does have one of the odd quirks, as well, of having some night scenes where you can easily make out large white clouds in the background. I'm not sure I've seen that anywhere else, but it almost gives sort of a Twilight Zone effect, which of course rarely has a place in westerns.

I am not a big fan of westerns, but I do think that it is a series different enough from most westerns, that even a western devotee would find quite a bit to interest them.",1469836800,5,1186,4.435779816513762

6290465,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"The series (1967-68, CBS) faced an uphill ratings battle....it was a 90-minute western, competing with at least two shows from each competing network. It needed to be a hit because it was an expensive project; rich in exterior scenes, historically intriguing plots and violent action for it's time....(there was a big push in TV to cut back on violence). It premiered when new westerns were not faring too well, though Gunsmoke, The Virginian and Bonanza still prospered. Some westerns like Rawhide had run their course, most of the Warner Bros westerns had run their course and stretching the powerhouse Wagon Train to 90 minutes would bring about it's end.
Stuart Whitman as Marshal Jim Crown. A veteran Oscar-nominated actor and superb horseman, he co-produced it with CBS. His character was unique, especially when compared to the TV lawmen who came before him. Crown was a smart, dedicated lawman in 1888, but enjoyed having a nip and his respect for the ex-scouts and frontiersmen often placed him against the town. Crown would cut the frontiersmen some slack if they got unruly and was quick to point out what they had done and sacrificed. When a store owner would carry on, Crown would ask ""What did you give up in St. Louis besides a failing business? Men like him saved fools like you by the wagon full."" If Crown returned to town and learned the bank was robbed, the big mouths would get his response: ""I've got some spare rifles; you'll get paid a $1 a day as deputies. Who wants a badge?"" There would be no takers.
Whitman was the backbone of the show, with an uneven supporting cast. In particular, Jill Townsend as a sweet young woman Dulcy who inherited the saloon adjoining Crown's jail was quite good, easy on the eyes and served as an outlet when Crown explained things and people; good, evil and in-between. The audience got a perspective as well. Randy Boone played Francis, a wide-eyed young photo journalist and Percy Herbert played MacGregor, both of whom doubled as Crown's deputies: both inept and easily sandbagged. I found them tiresome. The great theme music by Maurice Jarre enhanced the eye-popping opening/closing title sequences, still impressive.
The product itself: the DVD prints are OK but not as glass-like as other shows of the era like The FBI and Hawaii Five-0. In fact the prints look to be the same as when the series aired a while back on our cable station Encore Westerns. The booklet gives cast, crew and synopsis for each episode. The bonus is an interview on the last disc with Stuart Whitman.",1440806400,11,2541,4.80365296803653

The series has popped up on cable over the years, but I've longed to have my own copy.  So overall, I'll give it a 5!!  Though brief, the interview w/Whitman is great to see and provides some insight.  The acting, direction, and music in the series are excellent.  I'd recommend this series to any lover of Westerns.",1434758400,,489,4.488636363636363
6290476,3,B00IS6WQ2S,"This is hard review to write. Originally broadcast on CBS in 1967-68, ""Cimarron Strip"" was the last of television's ambitious series westerns. Although its interiors were staged at CBS Studio Center (and look it), many of its exteriors were shot on rugged locations in California and elsewhere, as ""Have Gun -- Will Travel"" had been about a decade before. Such production values for roughly two movies a month, across eleven consecutive months, made the show extremely expensive for CBS to produce; because it was not a genuine hit, the show was cancelled after only one season of 23 episodes. That's too bad, because the writing was a cut above other that of other series in that era. The regular supporting players around the lead were competent but lackluster; that, plus the commitment to watch a 90-minute western (close to 70, without commercials), may have done the show in. However, Stuart Whitman is rock-solid in the lead, and the guest stars turned in some extraordinary performances. (A fine example is Richard Boone as ""The Roarer"": an aging, charming cavalry sergeant who cannot make his peace with civilization.) I'm debiting two stars, not for the show itself, but for the inferior production values of e One, the discs' manufacturer. I cannot remember seeing a vintage television show or movie on DVDs whose image quality is so poor. (At least one act break ends with the old ""change-the-reel"" circle winking in the upper right corner of the screen.) Unless you can purchase this product at a considerable discountwhich I didyou're being asked to pay top dollar for a not-quite-classic TV show, reproduced from syndication prints and untouched since 1968. It's great to have ""Cimarron Strip"" back, but that series deserves a lot better than this.",1433635200,11,1763,5.041095890410959

6290479,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"It's a curious but true fact that very few TV shows (as distinct from movies shown on TV, or even made-for-TV movies) ever succeeded with a 90-minute format; the only two that lasted for any significant length of time were The Virginian and The Sunday-Night Mystery Movie, and the latter was really several revolving series, not just one, which gave each of them between two and four weeks to film a segment.  This one should have done equally well, and it's always surprised me that it didn't, but now at least we have it on DVD to enjoy over again.  (It's another curious fact that, unlike most TV series, it was actually made available on videotape for a while, one episode per cassette, through Stuart Whitman's production company, which somehow acquired the rights.)  The year is 1888, the setting what is now the panhandle of Oklahoma, a long narrow last-remains-of-the-Old-West sandwiched between Kansas, eastern New Mexico, the windswept Staked Plains of Texas, and the no-man's-land of the Cherokee Outlet, which provides a splendid sanctuary, inviolable except by the Army and Federal marshals, to fugitives of every stripe.  To this final Western frontier comes cigar-smoking, 35-year-old U.S. Marshal Jim Crown (Whitman), to headquarter in Cimarron, the eponymous town of the Strip, and also oversee its other five towns, Hardesty, Shades Wells, Beaver City, Grand Valley, and Guymon.  There he meets Angus MacGregor (Percy Herbert), brewer of whiskey and teller of tales; Francis Wilde (Randy Boone), photographer and free-lance newspaper correspondent looking for a legend to sell to the Eastern sheets; and Dulcey Coopersmith (Jill Townsend), 18-year-old heiress to the Wayfarers' Inn, whose quiet unquestioning faith in him is enough to shake even a cynical lawmanwhen he warns her that this raw frontier will kill her, she calmly says, That can't happen...You're here.

The series has some obvious similarities to the much-longer-running ""Gunsmoke,"" but it's no clone.  Crown may not have Matt Dillon's imposing size, but he has real presence and benefits from a deep growly drawl, angular face, deep chest, and something of a gunfighter's look, with his solid-silver hatband, silver-buttoned Mexican trousers, and long-barrelled, silver-plated, ivory-handled sixgun.  He's also experienced in the ways of outlaws, and a clever strategist whose active mind is shown at work more than once (one semi-foe even gives him the nickname Tricky Jim).  He copes with sooners, Indians, Army officers (not all of them by any means helpful), and an assortment of gunfighters, badmen, and wannabes ranging from punk cattlemen's sons to men grown old in the ways of crime.  Some of his foes are almost tragic, men he understands and respects, like the Indian chief (Henry Wilcoxon) who has lost his land, the respect of his people, and finally his only son; the veteran buffalo hunter (Albert Salmi) who rightfully points out that men like him were on the scene when even pioneers and soldiers feared to dare the Indians, and finds it bewildering that there's now no place for them; or the 23-year veteran cavalryman (Richard Boone, the only person designated a guest star in the opening credits, possibly because he and Whitman had worked together in the movie ""Rio Conchos"") who realizes, to his utter bewilderment, that what he was trained to do and honored for doing is no longer required: men who, like Crown himself, wish the old wild cattleman's-and-Indian's West could last forever.  Not all are without redeeming features: there's Jud Starr, who, though ruthless enough to kill a boy he loved like a son when the youngster is unwittingly used by Crown as a Judas goat, alternates between grief and sarcastic rebuke when Crown accidentally shoots his half-Cherokee fiancee; or Jinglebob McQueen, whose powerful rancher father has taught him all his life to stand his ground, but has also lamented over and over that he can't do anything right; or Sgt. Clay Tyce, a handsome, gallant Irishman who, even though he's in league with rustlers, is charming and chivalrous to Dulcey and has a host of friends in town as well as the loyalty of his men.  And then there are the true originals, notably frequent TV heavy L. Q. Jones, who, in The Search, appears as a very different kind of characterLummy, a scavenger who discovers the wounded Marshal out on the prairie and convinces himself that by rescuing Mister Kingly Crown he'll earn such gratitude from the citizens of Cimarron that they might even build [me]a statue!

Unlike most Westerns of the Golden Age, this one is notably consistent in its dating and with history; frequent mention is made of Congress's foot-dragging over the opening of the Cherokee Outlet to white settlement, and there's even a chillingly suspenseful story (written by sf great Harlan Ellison) which posits that after his last London killing, Jack the Ripper went to the U.S. and eventually arrived in Cimarron in December, 1888.  On the other hand, at least some of the stories seem to be told out of order: in The Battleground, which is the pilot in a flashback frame, we learn that Crown's Marshal's commission is dated August of '88, and in Nobody, Warren Oates as Mobeetie (a role he created in the other segment) says it's been a long hard year since he lost his job therein; it's also very hot in Cimarronyet the Ripper episode comes 10 segments later.  And the settings are very often quite incongruous, desert and mountain rather than level High Plain.

The guest list features many well-known names of the day, including John Saxon (for once not playing a Hispanic part), Henry Silva, Darren McGavin, Barbara Luna, Beau Bridges, Steve Forrest (who appears twice, as charming, handsome rogues), Pat Hingle, Telly Savalas, R. G. Armstrong, Broderick Crawford, Kevin Hagen, Gene Evans, John Anderson, Robert Duvall, Morgan Woodward, Joseph cotton, Jim Davis, Suzanne Pleshette, Lola Albright, Leslie Nielsen, Simon Oakland, Royal Dano (as a light-eyed half-Pawnee), Robert J. Wilkie, Denver Pyle, J. D. Cannon, Lyle Bettger, James Stacy, David Carradine, Steve Ihnat, James Gregory, Robert Lansing, Slim Pickens, Bob Random, Tuesday Weld, Philip Carey, Mariette Hartley, Jon Voight, Mark Lenard, and David Brian.  Maurice Jarre's stirring theme, and the incidental scores for the various episodes, ought to be brought out on CD.  The color quality, I have to admit, is somewhat uneven, and occasionally the picture will jump or flicker as if the print had been made from a videocassette rather than an archival copy; and the bonus interview with Whitman (now in his 80's) is very short (only eight minutes).  But, as Whitman himself says, it was a series with a good family of regulars, and he had great fun doing itand it shows.",1427932800,2,6774,5.0864864864864865

He will use either or both if necessary, however, and woe to those who face either.  Some very unusual and effective episodes like ""A Knife In The Darkness"" where it seems like ""Jack-the-Ripper"" has taken his murder spree to Cimarron, and ""The Beast That Walks Like A Man"" with Simon Oakland doing a great guest turn make this western something other than ordinary.  Stuart Whitman is clearly the star, though, and he chews up the Cimarron with his star power and compelling portrayal of Jim Crown.",1406073600,3,797,4.545454545454546

I can't believe it was canceled after one season.",1405382400,,337,4.775862068965517
6290549,4,B00IS6WQ2S,"I love TV westerns and this is a good one. It only suffers in comparison with Gunsmoke, a legendary series which necessarily has to be compared since, well to put it bluntly if not too diplomatically, Cimarron Strip is a Gunsmoke ripoff. Or ""clone"", to be more polite.

Consider the similarities:

1. Dodge City and Cimarron are frontier towns ""tamed"" by an overworked marshal in the late 1800's U.S. Western frontier.
2. The marshal is assisted by a crew of seemingly borderline competent (or incompetent) deputies.
3. The marshal is platonically involved with a woman in the ""hospitality"" business who loves him silently from afar.
4. The townspeople are a mix of generally honest but chronically cowardly folks who tolerate the law but frequently also tolerate those who run afoul of it.

But there are sizeable differences as well, which account for why Cimarron Strip doesn't compare well with Gunsmoke:

1. The marshal, Jim Crown, played by a capable Stuart Whitman, does a capable job but he lacks the depth, humanity and subtle sense of humor of Matt Dillon, played by the incomparable James Arness.

2. Gunsmoke's deputies, Chester Goode and then Festus Hagen, while often the butt of jokes and played maximally silly by Dennis Weaver and Ken Curtis, nonetheless have depth to them and are often competent and skilled enough to carry the day. Many a Gunsmoke episode has been built almost entirely around the deputies. The two deputies in Cimarron Strip generally overact horribly and invariably their in-character behavior is totally incompetent: more than one episode gets its storyline from either deputy screwing up and letting a villain escape jail.

3. The platonic loves are generally comparable, although Miss Kitty starts out her career as a madame of ill repute where Dulcey appears to have never dabbled in fulfilling that particular cowboy need in her establishment. Jill Townsend is much younger than Amanda Blake and her appeal is more fresh-faced and homespun; blue-eyed and straw-spun blonde, it's worth watching some episodes just to see her bite her lower lip with her cute overbite!

4. The rest of the CS cast just doesn't compare. Doc is a powerful and important figure in Gunsmoke; the doc in Cimarron is a cipher, barely making any appearances and when he does it's just to bandage up a wound and devoid of the homey sayings and witticism of Gunsmoke's legendary physician.

Gunsmoke scripts are for the most part far superior as well. An ordinary Gunsmoke episode, particular from the black-and-white era, is superior to the best story ever told on Cimarron Strip. Of course, Marshal Crown only had one season riding his mount across the Strip... perhaps things would have improved over the years. We shall never know...",1405296000,2,2753,5.021929824561403

It also starred Percy Herbert as MacGregor a cantankerous Scottish saloon owner, Jill Townsend as Dulcey an English rose who comes to find her father and stays taking over the saloon and turning it into an inn and Randy Boone from ""The Virginian"" as Francis a freelance reporter.

This series only lasted one season but deserved to run for longer. Great production values are evident from the beginning to the end. I believe this was the only series Stuart Whitman did. Although he did appear in movies and guest starred in order TV shows.
I thought this show was cancelled because we already had a marshal in Gunsmoke but it seems that there was another reason. On this DVD set the bonus feature is an interview with Stuart Whitman which was all too short for my liking. Here he explains why the show was cancelled. It seems the producer was Leonard Freeman and he was producing another series for TV called ""Hawaii Five O"" with Stuart Whitman in mind for the part of Steve McGarrett. I had heard that Jack Lord was not the actor who was originally intended for the role but was brought in at the last minute to everyone's surprise. Now I know who that actor was. So Cimarron Strip was cancelled in favor of Five O and the rest is history.
Still, this is a fine western and below are some of my favourite episodes:

THE HUNTED: Two outlaw bothers turn themselves in to Marshal Crown for a fair trial but a wealthy cattleman who's son was killed hires two bounty hunters to kill them.

THE DEPUTY: A man hires on as Marshal Crown's deputy in order to exact revenge on his cohorts who left him for dead after a robbery went wrong.

KNIFE IN THE DARKNESS: A killer is on the loose with two women mutilated. Could this be the work of Jack the Ripper?

THE GREENERS: Marshal Crown tries to convince a family to testify in a case where they saw the lynching of two derelicts.

WHITEY: A vengeance crazed outlaw plans to get even with the gang who double-crossed him. He takes Dulcey hostage but begins to fall in love with her. She also starts to have feelings for him. Will he go through with his plan and will he make it out alive?",1404950400,5,2547,4.5524017467248905

6290577,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"The strip of land known as the Cimarron Territory and later the Oklahoma Panhandle, left virtually ungoverned for decades in the 1800s, is the perfect place to set a good, old-fashioned Western. Edna Ferber set her epic, sprawling novel CIMARRON in this area of the United States and the resultant film adaptation in 1930 starring Richard Dix was the first Western to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. It was re-made in 1960 with Glenn Ford, a few years after the first TV series with Cimarron in the title: Cimarron City, starring George Montgomery.

By the time CIMARRON STRIP came along, TV Westerns were at their apex, with some shows, like Gunsmoke, running for over a decade by 1967, when CIMARRON STRIP was produced. Speaking of Gunsmoke, a number of the creative minds behind that still remarkable program were involved in the production of this new, ""90-minute"" Western. It looked like a sure hit.

The budgets were big, and according to star Stuart Whitman (in a terrific extra feature bonus interview included in this collection) top dollar was paid to get the best talent. A look at this partial list of guest stars during the show's 23 episode run attests to this fact: Richard Boone, Beau Bridges, David Carradine, Seymour Cassel, Joseph Cotten, Broderick Crawford, Royal Dano, Robert Duvall, Steve Forrest, Victor French, Mariette Hartley, Robert Lansing, Darren McGavin, Leslie Nielsen, Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, Suzanne Pleshette, Denver Pyle, Telly Savalas, John Saxon, Tom Skerritt, Jon Voight, Tuesday Weld, Robert Wilke, Morgan Woodward and more!

Stunning symphonic theme music reinforces this promise of quality. Composed by nine time Oscar nominee (he won thrice) Maurice Jarre, the sweeping score propels a hard riding Stuart Whitman over the opening and closing credits. It's a classic opening and screams ""BIG! BIG!""

The supporting cast, though not in the same league as the supporting roles on Gunsmoke, are all very good, with Percy Herbert in particular adding some colour as Scotsman MacGregor. One almost expects him to say ""she canna hold much longer, Marshal!"" much like another volatile, fictional Scotsman on the small screen at this time, Canadian actor James Doohan's ""Scotty"" on Star Trek. Herbert's MacGregor is a vivid contrast to Whitman's usually calm Marshal Jim Crown. Randy Boone, as sometimes gullible but always sincere Francis Wilde, was fresh off of television's first 90-minute Western, The Virginian. Given another season, his character might've matured into a stronger, more reliable deputy, instead of the one who always wound up getting caught and handing over the keys to the jail cell to the bad guys. Jill Townsend, too, as Dulcie Coopersmith, fought hard to make her character into more than a one-dimensional virgin who nurses an unrequited love for Marshal Crown. She is lovely and her caring nature is more than just innocence--she is genuinely compassionate.

So why did CIMARRON STRIP only last one season? Probably just timing. A clue is to be found, again in the interview with Stuart Whitman, when he divulges that one of the CIMARRON STRIP creators, Leonard Freeman, presented Whitman with a new pilot script he had written called Hawaii 5-0. Freeman strongly encouraged Whitman to walk away from his commitment to his CIMARRON STRIP company, predicting that times were changing and it was now the dawn of the era of the detective show. Whitman, to his credit, said no and stuck to his guns (in this case, a .45 calibre nickel-plated seven inch barrel revolver). Whitman had a one third producing interest in CIMARRON STRIP and really wanted it to succeed. He apparently loved doing the show, too. But, alas, Freeman was right, and CIMARRON STRIP was cancelled after 23 episodes (filmed over an incredibly tight 11 month period).

Rather than lament what could have been, it's time to celebrate the proper DVD release of this terrific, albeit short-lived, series. Nitpickers may point and say that the episodes have been tampered with (some slight editing is noticeable in places) but given the age of the shows and their previous limited availability, this is a minor point of contention. Only one episode jarred in this way, with the climactic shoot-out being momentarily compromised by a bad edit.

Overall, the picture quality and sound balance is excellent and, of great importance to more and more viewers of classic programs, closed captioning/subtitles is an option. Beautifully packaged on 8 discs, CIMARRON STRIP is a must-have for collectors of classic TV Westerns.

A handful of episodes are a little sub-par, story-wise, but this is more than compensated for by the balance of the episodes which range between very good and excellent. Arguably the stand out is Knife in the Darkness, a take on Jack the Ripper which is so rich in atmosphere you can almost taste the fog. Written by Harlan Ellison, known particularly for his contributions to the Science Fiction genre, This show really packs a wallop and demonstrates how far the producers were willing to go to breathe new life into the serial Western.

In stark contrast to the heightened drama of this episode are the delightful touches of humour that manifest now and then. Early in the series, while Marshal Crown is attempting to take a much-deserved bath, some bad guys ride through town, stirring up trouble. Whitman, wearing only a bath towel (!) grabs his .45 and jumps out the window and down onto the street, battling with the badmen until they are subdued. The towel, which in reality would have had to have been surgically attached in order to not fall off, adds an hilarious counterpoint to the violence of the scene. It almost seems a subtle acknowledgement of all those fight scenes involving Marshal Dillon on Gunsmoke in which his hat never falls off. Given the earlier mentioned creative connection to Gunsmoke, this is entirely possible!

Again going back to Stuart Whitman, he says in his interview that rather than listen to him talk about the series, fans should just watch the episodes. He seems genuinely excited at the prospect of so many people rediscovering CIMARRON STRIP, a show that obviously meant a great deal to him. It's easy to understand why. Marshal Jim Crown is multi-faceted, often behaving in ways that are entirely unexpected, especially when in a tight spot. Yet he never compromises his integrity as a Western hero deserving of our esteem.

CIMARRON STRIP is an outstanding series. It took awhile to make its way onto DVD, but now that it is here it is just waiting to be enjoyed.",1403913600,9,6564,5.029438822447102

Most story lines are fine, some really excellent.  The scenery is beautiful and there's lots of action.  I absolutely love the theme music and the opening credits. A fine extra is Stuart Whitman remembering the show.  The only real weaknesses are the secondary characters: Francis & MacGregor are too dimwitted and ineffectual to be deputies and the fact that some shows are a little too violent (the west would have been completely depopulated).  Dulcy is exquisite: bright & beautiful.  It's one of the very best westerns of the era and that's saying something.  I only wish it had lasted longer than 23 episodes.

6290583,4,B00IS6WQ2S,"Although I would've of loved to have left a five rating, on this DVD set itself I could not, and I will say why in a minute.  I waited sometime on pre-order to get this show. LIke many others DVD sets that have come out, in the past it's essentially issues with the sets, not the issue with the show itself. if I were rating  the show itself of course it's a five all the way....Or I would not of purchased it, and I love Stuart Whitman and always have. I like his voice and facial expressions especially with his eyes, and his swagger while he walks, it's like (okay go ahead and try and run one by me, but it won't work attitude)!!!!

Also, he has played in many many roles, I enjoyed. Just side stepping for a moment. Another role that stood out with me about Whitman that I enjoyed was the move ""Convicts Four"" (1962) where he portrayed a prison guard and then was promoted to a Warden where he portrayed those same characteristics, especially when he became the Warden to and focused on one inmate in particular. He played pretty much opposite to Ben Gazzara whom I also like, and was a fine actor (Gazzara was the convict, based on a true story). Also Broad Crawford whom I also like was in a short stint of that movie, along with many other great stars. I'm not into allot of westerns, unless there is Human interest behind it. I'm not just looking for a bang bang shoot um up.

Going back to CS Whitman could've held the show himself with just the weekly guest stars. However to be fair, I do believe if maybe they would've had more of a storyline centered  around  his co-stars from time to time, it would of brought  them out more. I wanted something more with the Dulcey character in it. Although I just received the set last week. The first episode I viewed was the one with Broad Crawford in ""Blue Moon Train"" ( it was ironic watching Whitman play opposite Crawford, as more of a hauncho, unlike in the early days of Crawford's TV series Highway Patrol where Whitman a patrol man was under Crawford that came and went). However, another one of my favorites thus far from CS was ""Heller""with Tuesday Weld ( I saw that on TV a few years ago). I recall thinking that I wish this show would come out on DVD finally. I had not watched some them since I was a kid.  The other episode I also liked thus far was ""Big Jessie"" with Mariette Hartley, that  had allot of good twists and turns to it, and a good storyline with human interests characters as well. What is ironic about Heller and Big Jessie, is as the viewer, it makes me wonder what is up with Crown. You know the women liked him, but was it the other way around?

I also took the liberty of watching the commentary with Whitman which is located on Disc 8, since nobody was asking questions of him, he was just talking about the show, and gave some insights for the making of it. I was hoping, that he would have given the audience a bit more insight of what was going on behind the set. It's makes it more interesting, however, there was some goodies in it, that I think the viewers will like. (It is not that long).

Now to the issues: The biggest issue from what I have viewd was the issue with the quality, of the sound but more so with the picture as many other reviewers mentioned, it looked equal to a Made For Demand DVD's. I was disappointed that they did not edit, the quality of the picture like it could've of been, especially for what Amazon is charging. I used a BluRay, which would enhance any issues more then a regular DVD player. Granted it's a dated show. However, I viewed and owned shows older then this and they were remastered and edited very well. Shows in color were not out that long in the 60's, so I understand that some of the colors are not as natural as they are today. (If you were privy to own or have access to a color TV set in that era). With the older shows I actually prefer the shows in black and white. However, I do agree with other reviewers, that when CBS edits they do a heck of a job, on their shows whether it's color or black and white. They are simply flawless, so if the consumer pays a bit more, then it's worth it. I just chalked it up that it was a cheaper company.

I didn't notice the time cut in the shows, that other reviewers mentioned. Obviously due to commercials they are not going to run 90 minutes. I figured about 75 or 80 min. As I stated in the aforementioned a few years ago while watching it on television re-runs, the length was the about the same that was provided to us on DVD. However, compared to the amount of commercials they have on television today, for a 90 min show this is like heaven. If there was something missing, it didn't alter the storyline for me. I do not have equipment to check to see how long the show is actually running.

There were two minor issues that bothered me a little. One was the issue of the Air dates of the show. For example, the pilot/first show ""Battleground"" was not on the first disc nor listed as a first show, but instead it was on disc two as the 2nd episode. Some of the other shows were out of Air date order also. However, I don't watch them like that, but I know others that do. I only noticed it because they had the production numbers on the shows on what order they were aired, because they had a full complete episode guide that I was very happy about.  Other sets if they even have one it's just the, air date and description, however, they went a bit further and listed all the guest stars. As on many sets the viewer has to hunt through the actual DVD  to find that guest star which drives me nuts. I like to see who is in the show, and go right into it. The last issue is they put the disc holder in upside down. I could take it out, but I might break it. So when I close the dust cover everything is upside down.

All in all I'm still glad to have Cimarron Strip in my DVD collection, and I can't wait to view all 23 shows. Again, they are not easy to obtain. If I known that Whitman was selling  them online as somebody mentioned, then I would of bought it there a few years back. However, if you love this show I would still highly recommend this. So I assign this DVD set four stars...........",1401408000,5,6187,4.216398985629755

6290585,4,B00IS6WQ2S,"Cimarron Strip: The Complete Series originally aired on CBS from September 1967 to March 1968. It was one of only three 90-minute weekly Western series that aired during the 1960s (the others are The Virginian and, for one season, Wagon Train), and the only 90-minute series to be centered on one lead character.

The Cimarron Strip, the border region between Kansas and Indian Territory, was a dangerous place in the late 19th century, and it was up to one man to keep the peace  tough U.S. Marshal Jim Crown (Stuart Whitman). Production values are strong, though many of the stories seem overly padded and would have worked better in a one-hour format. It's fun to see such an impressive roster of familiar faces in the cast.

Guest stars included Beau Bridges, David Carradine, Joseph Cotten, Robert Duvall, Mariette Hartley, Darren McGavin, Leslie Nielsen, Suzanne Pleshette, Telly Savalas, John Saxon, Jon Voight, and Tuesday Weld.

6290586,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"Well you got your wish, Mr. Whitman. After the disappointing cancellation of this high calibre series, Whitman thereafter looked out of place out of the saddle and in the modern city (at least to me), whether it was under the sea (Irwin Allen's ""City Beneath The Sea"") or on dry land. Indeed he seemed so ideal for the part of Marshal Crown that it was almost as if he had been snatched up from the 1880s for real. It broke my heart when we had to (seemingly) give him back to the ages. I was fifteen when this gritty but realistic series was cancelled and replaced by Hawaii Five-O. It would be the only time I ever wrote a protest letter to a network to save a series from cancellation, but of course, it was to no avail. The public was tiring of the western genre, but this one spared no expense, what with location shooting in and around the Alabama Hills, Bishop, and Kanab, and of course, the opening credits shot on a high clearing (thankfully still unspoiled to this day) just a hundred or so yards north of Thundercloud Lane, Lone Pine, California (before you get to Tuttle Creek Road) beneath a snow-capped Mount Whitney, and to the accompaniment of Academy Award winner, Maurice Jarre's exhilarating score. Gunsmoke was a great western, but I never could get used to Dodge City being indoors on a soundstage, what with 'the sun' casting shadows in several different directions. Cimarron seemed to have more realism.

As for the quality of the DVD transfers, there is much room for improvement, providing well preserved prints still lie in CBS's vaults. As CBS's home video release of the Wild Wild West attests, I can't help but believe a much better transfer to home video could have been accomplished here had it been done from film stock instead of, from all appearances, recycled videotape, but I'm so glad to have a hard copy of this marvelous program, I can ignore it. I suppose little effort was made towards restoration due to limited public interest, not that Cimarron Strip is undeserving of such an endeavor. I just hope pristine negatives exist so that this program can once again be seen in all its glory, and I would also hope that this is accomplished before it's too late and the original negatives are lost to deterioration. I maintained five stars because this may be as good as it gets, considering the age of these prints. The running time of the first episode clocked in at nearly 73 minutes, which means, after commercials, that very little, if any program content is missing (it was in a 90 minute time slot).",1400284800,30,2543,4.626106194690266

6290589,3,B00IS6WQ2S,"One of my favorites is finally getting the official DVD treatment, but everyone's legitimate gripe / complaint will surely be that the episodes' running times indicate we'll be viewing cut-down, syndication prints.  Why should the distributor expect consumers to pay $70 USD and upwards for incomplete episodes, the same versions that have been repeated to death?!  As to the video and sound quality we can ""hope for the best.""  Because, this long-awaited-for set is not being re-mastered and released by CBS who provided those sharp-looking ""Gunsmoke,"" ""Rawhide"" and ""Have Gun - Will Travel"" DVD sets.  Unlike the 75-minute running times of another 90-minute western, the official DVD versions of ""The Virginian's"" 1967-68 episodes, the average running time of these precious 23 ""Cimarron Strip"" episodes is only 70-and-a-half minutes (70.4 mins./ea.).  That's the same length they were when when Encore Westerns ran them, but not CBS in 1967-68; a few minutes short.  The series' star Stuart Whitman owns the rights to his show and surely is instrumental in all aspects of its post network life (just as he was 47 years ago in its CBS life).  I have to wonder if the film vaults of Hollywood weren't thoroughly searched for the missing ""trims"" in order that they be re-inserted into the 35mm masters.  Or even utilize CBS's back-up 16mm prints to obtain the missing minutes.  To verify the running time discrepancies fortunately I possess a copy of each episodes' timesheet distributed to appropriate parties by the Silverbach-Lazarus Group, the company that at one time possessed the syndication rights.  At most of the act breaks there's three minutes of ""black"" indicating / specifying to the local stations' editors how many minutes and seconds of commercials, promos, PSAs and IDs could be inserted at each break.  In the 1960s an act break on a network primetime program was only one minute; at most one and a half.  That's a big, obvious clue to ""the problem"" right there.  In Broderick Crawford's episode ""The Blue Moon Train"" the end credits (and IMDB) list a small role simply called Hobo (as in hobo on a train).  That character simply doesn't exist on the available prints.  As to picture quality:  in a beautiful, distant-location exterior in ""Journey to a Hanging"" showing Whitman and others riding, a day-for-night filter (or similar visual adjustment) kicks in midway through the scene.  That is not intentional.  Wouldn't it be great if Whitman and Jill Townsend and Randy Boone, his surviving costars, and some of the guest stars and creator Christopher Knopf provided vital bonus track commentaries?!  Two guest stars (now deceased), who repeated their characters, were strong additions to the show IMO:  Andrew Duggan as (U.S. Army) Major Covington and Robert J. Wilke as rancher Hardy Miller.  Despite my expressed criticisms and reservations I will still buy ""Cimarron Strip.""  And I hope you do too, and that an informed and appreciative commentary can evolve.",1395187200,63,2985,5.136645962732919
6290590,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"The CBS American Western, Cimarron Strip, aired on CBS Television Network from September 1967 to March 1968. The series starred Stuart Whitman as Marshal Jim Crown, who dealt out western justice with a gun and emotion.  This series was produced by the creators of the legendary western, Gunsmoke.  In my opinion, it was an overlooked western, that never received the credit that it was due and was cancelled far too soon.  The music, the stories, supporting cast and it's realism helped make Cimarron Strip one of the greatest westerns ever produced.",1395014400,12,550,5.021978021978022
6290591,5,B00IS6WQ2S,"Cimarron Strip started with one of my favorite tv openings.  A solitary rider rides quickly on his horse.  The camera comes in on him from very high and as we get close up we can see that it is the macho Stuart Whitman.  The camera turns around and goes way high again (probably a helicoptor shot) and we can see Whitman continue to ride alone, the vast expanse of prairie surrounding him on both sides.  This is accompanied by one of the great musical themes.
So began Cimarron Strip, the third 90 minute western of the 1960s behind The Virginian and Wagon Train.  Stuart Whitman was great as Marshal Jim Crown, the only law for hundreds of miles.  The scripts were great with the usual great guest stars of the 1960s.  One of my favorite episodes was ""Knife in the Darkness,"" written by sci-fi legend, Harlan Ellison.  This episode takes place in one night and has Jack the Ripper finding his way into Cimarron.  He is accompanied by a freaky fog that rolls around throughout the entire episode.  What a great sense of atmosphere and suspense as Crown tries to figure out which of the strangers in town is Jack.  One of my favorite tv shows ever.
The one weakness in the show is the supporting cast.  Crown's main deputy is the Scotsman, MacGregor played by British actor Percy Herbert.  Herbert appeared in many films and British tv shows during the '60s (including the Brando ""Mutiny on the Bounty."")  His MacGregor looks tough but is of no help to Crown at all.  He doesn't even carry a handgun, using a rifle instead.  Crown's other deputy is the wussy Francis, played by Randy Boone, just coming off of The Virginian.  The only female of the show, Dulcey is a young woman, played by British actress Jill Townsend, who has inherited the restaurant next to Crown's jail.  She is a much younger woman than Whitman and her character has an obvious crush on him despite the fact that he treats her like a little sister.  The supporting actors and characters on this series could have been stronger.
This was a large scale and obviously expensive western.  It ran on CBS Thursday nights from 7:30-9:00PM from 1967-1968.  It did not do well against Ironside on NBC and was cancelled.  It was replaced in 1968 by a new police series called Hawaii Five-O. (I'm sure you've heard of it.)
If you want to see an excellent but not very well-remembered western, you should pick this set up.  I know I will be.",1394496000,89,2402,4.5607476635514015
8644892,4,B00IS6WQ2S,"Stuart Whitman stars in all 23 feature length episodes (one hour & 12 minutes approximately) broadcast in color during the 1967-68 season. Randy Boone from The Virginian co-starred as Francis, burgeoning newspaper man.

The only special feature is a Stuart Whitman interview less than eight minutes long. Some episodes may be slightly edited and the picture is not as good as say Bonanza and The Virginian from the same time period. Most shows are action oriented. Some are more comical than others, and some are pretty serious.
