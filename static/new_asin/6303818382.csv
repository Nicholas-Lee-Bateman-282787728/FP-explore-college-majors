I'm sure that if you are a Atlanta fan, then this World Series probably brings back good memories. Good for you! I'm an Cleveland fan, and while the series film does bring back some good memories, the 1995 team will alway be remembered as coming up short. The Braves pretty much had things in control and the Indians just couldn't call up that magic that propelled them to the series.

The problem with this highlight film is that it is just too formulaic, and it doesn't do much other than serve as a document for Atlanta's only championship during a long span of division titles. The game by game coverage was ok, but what bothered me most was the time spent on Chipper Jones and his dad. (if the Indians had won, then it would have been the same thing with Thome's dad. Trust me, they had the stock video all ready to go). It's as if they had to manufacture some sort of story as a theme for the film. What's worse is that Chipper comes across as a cocksure pampered kid and his dad as the double of Mr. Duggar (19 kids and counting).

Overall, this World Series film is nice if your an Atlanta Braves fan. The series however, wasn't one of the most memorable ones in history.",1326844800,,1297,4.355371900826446

These stars, a supporting cast Bobby Cox and the best pitching coach in the National League were constants that brought the Braves a consistent string of East Division Championship and numerous National League Championships.  But when it came to the World Series something would happen to cause them to lose the World Series often close exciting series like th 1991 series against Minnesota or 1996 and 1999 against the Yankees.  But during this great run 1995 was the only series they actually won!  This may come as a surprise to many baseball fans.",1207872000,,650,4.881818181818182
