5241063,2,B0091C21XM,I was disappointed that it was a boiled-down version of the miniseries instead of the full version I remembered and was expecting.,1368144000,4,130,4.954545454545454
5241064,3,B0091C21XM,"you like old black and white television from the early 1950's.  Was hoping to see more of Joanne Woodward interacting with the Lincoln character, but you get very little of her.  Its problem is the really old feel to it; as if a rehearsal is being filmed and it's not ready for the actual play!",1363219200,2,294,4.327272727272727
5241065,5,B0091C21XM,Royal Dano is Lincoln he gives an uncanny performance as a young Lincoln  and also as an older worn out Lincoln Fine writing by James Agee and Direction by Norman Lloyd,1357948800,5,168,4.419354838709677
8533965,5,B0091C21XM,"Having seen this film when it was first shown, it was a wonderful trip down memory lane to see it after so many years. I was very pleased that it had lost none of its impact on me. Omnibus was a an extraordinary program and a tribute to the inventiveness and originality of the early days of television.",1494288000,,303,4.241379310344827

8533968,3,B0091C21XM,"I give this three stars for the script, the acting, and the overall presentation.  But I was extremely disappointed to find that it is not the complete version of the original Omnibus telecasts.  There were five parts, and this volume contains only three.  The reference guide included with the discs specifically mentions some incidents that were obviously in the omitted sections.  Instead of the Lincoln and Ann Rutledge discussion, I would have much preferred to view the other two parts of the series.",1456099200,,506,5.0602409638554215
8533969,5,B0091C21XM,"I feel so privileged to own this historic documentary on the life of Lincoln.
 If you admire Lincoln and wish to see a rare and sensitive depiction of his life then I highly recommend this DVD.  A word of warning though:  the original broadcast was done in 1952, on television, and thus, the quality and sound are what you might expect from that era.  I don't know if the DVDs are transferred from a kinescope or film, I assume kinescope.  The viewing experience would be similar to watching silent era films.

Aside from that, I was impressed by all the little details in the series.  The acting by Royal Dano, Joanne Woodward, and the entire cast was sensitive and moving.  There is something about the honesty and earnestness of the entire cast and crew's effort in bringing this to the American public, that's missing from today's TV productions.  It might appear amateurish to today's eyes, but for me there's something special going on here.  James Agee's script was excellent and added much to the production.
If you can look past the production values and see this as a fitting tribute to the 16th president of the United States, then you won't be disappointed.",1442102400,3,1169,4.714285714285714
8533970,5,B0091C21XM,"I would have gone a hundred miles to see this!  It always stands out in my memory from all the programs  on Omnibus.  I wondered what happened to Royal Dano.  He's gone but his performance of Abe Lincoln lives on, along with Joanne Woodward as Ann Rutledge, and I did not know that James Agee was the screenwriter.  We're lucky to live in this day & age to see our favorite things reproduced so well.  Too bad the young ones don't know about this.  They don't know what they missed!  I'm trying to include Abe Lincoln in our Log Cabin News for the Log Cabin Society of Michigan for the Civil War Bicentennial.",1431302400,2,609,4.327433628318584

8533974,4,B0091C21XM,"Not being familiar with this 50 years old treatment of Lincoln, I did not know what to expect. I was surprised to see one of Joanne Woodward's TV appearances as the love interest of young Lincoln. The quality of the film seems to be somewhat poor, whether this is due to the transfer method, or the poor original quality. The acting is adequate- no Emmy awards here, but it is pleasant to look at, and informative, as well.",1404777600,,423,4.435897435897436
