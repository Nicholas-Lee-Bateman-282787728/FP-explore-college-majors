2793670,5,B000OCY7IK,"INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER, is by any other name MONSTER ZERO, or GODZILLA VS MONSTER ZERO. INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER is the ""International title"" that Toho gave to KAIJU DAISENSO, released in 1965. It was then acquired for release via AIP and Henry G. Saperstein(the producer)in 1966, and he parted ways with AIP and set out for his own distribution. That didn't happen until 1970 from Maron Films, a small indie release company and it was re-titled MONSTER ZERO and double-billed in roadshow fashion with WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS and did brisk business from late summer to Fall at drive-ins and theaters at the time. The film stars Nick Adams and was released in the US, two years after his untimely and unfortunate death. Still, MONSTER ZERO/INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER remains one of the best ever of the Toho Godzilla sequels, the last one where all the major talents at Toho were in play to make a knockout film that flies along at a good clip. It has everything-alien invasion, monsters, and a love story. Interestingly, the monster side of things actually takes a back seat to a fairly engaging human story(there are only really 10 or 12 minutes of new monster footage). The FX work is perhaps Eiji Tsuburaya's best as is the score by Akira Ifukube. This version is exactly the same as MONSTER ZERO-same title sequence, however a new title card for INVASION is seen. All the dubbing was the same, and in fact the film has three minutes of footage not seen in the US version. One is the alien Controller saying something in his native language as the earth ship leaves, another is a pretty nifty FX shot looking up at Godzilla and Rodan being transported through the atmosphere by the Xian saucers, and still another shot has what appears to be an un-processed(sound) shot of Akira Takarada saying something like ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" in Japanese, to Nick Adams who responds in English ""Talk to me about it pal"".

2793672,5,B000OCY7IK,"THIS IS ACTUALLY THE GODZILLA MOVIE ""MONSTER ZERO"". INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER is its absurd and nonsensical international title. It is a U.S./ Japan co-production. The movie was released in Japan in 1965 as GREAT MONSTER WAR. It was released internationally as INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER. In 1970 it was released
in America as MONSTER ZERO on a double bill with WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS. It continued to play on television
as MONSTER ZERO until it was replaced on TV and on VHS in the late 1980s by a version titled GODZILLA VS.
MONSTER ZERO.
INVASION OF ASTRO MONSTER is unusual in that , though it is basically a sequel to the previous film GHIDORAH THE THREE HEADED MONSTER it takes place in the year 196X:Suggesting it is the future.
The year was changed to 198X for the Champion Festival in the seventies. Most previous video

Conquering the Earth by means of mentally controlling King Ghidorah, Rodan, and Godzilla is what those seemingly beleaguered inhabitants of Planet X are really up to in this really fun Godzilla movie.
Astronauts Fuji and F. Glenn are heading towards the newly discovered Planet X - just slightly beyond Jupiter's orbit in our solar system.  Upon landing on the dark and mysterious work, they discover an advanced society living underground because of constant attacks by King Ghidorah - who has been terrorizing their world ever since Godzilla and Rodan banished the monster to the far reaches of interplanetary space..  Fortunately, the citizens of Planet X have a plan to save themselves and benefit Earth.  They want to borrow Godzilla  and Rodan, and in exchange, they'll give us the formula for a wonder medicine that will cure all disease.  A pretty fair trade, right?
if only those Planet X aliens weren't being sneaky and trying to conquer the Earth!
Godzilla and Rodan are captured in forcefields by flying saucers from Planet X and are taken to the mysterious planet where they successfully fight off King Ghidorah and banish him.  Greateful, the Planet X aliens send Fuji and F. Glenn back home with a tape that has the formula for the wonder drug which actually turns out to demand for humanity's surrender - GASP - like we didn't see this one coming!  Even the League of Women at the United Nations is appalled by the actions of Planet X and voice their displeasure - I kid you not here!
 So it's up to the combined efforts of Fuji and F. Glenn to come up with a way to save Humanity by freeing Godzilla and Rodan from the mind control of the Planet X aliens.
GREAT GODZILLA FUN!
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

2793710,4,B000OCY7IK,"(Invasion of Astro-Monster or Godzilla vs Monster Zero) 1965

The film was co-produced between the Japanese company Toho, and Henry G. Saperstein's American company UPA, marking the only time a Godzilla film was co-produced with an American studio. Directed by Ishir Honda, and featuring special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, music done by Akira Ifukube the film starred Hollywood actor Nick Adams, alongside Japanese actors Akira Takarada, Kumi Mizuno and Akira Kubo. This was also the first film to feature alien invaders, combining the series with outer space themes, such as civilizations on other planets and interplanetary space travel before Star Trek ever did anything.

Story: A two-man spacecraft, crewed by a Japanese and American (Fuji and Glenn), approaches Jupiter's orbit to explore the newly discovered Planet X. The planet maintains a position directly behind Jupiter, leaving its surface in twilight, with just enough light to make it possible to navigate its surface. After landing and disembarking, one of the astronauts and the ship vanishes, leaving the other to wonder where they have gone. Suddenly, a flat voice comes over the communications link and instructs the lone astronaut down into subterranean corridors to the office of the Controller of Planet X, where he finds his shipmate. The spacecraft is safe, the controller assures them and indicates that their location is about to be attacked by Monster-Zero. The astronauts recognize the attacking monster is King Ghidorah, the three-headed space dragon. The astronauts lose contact with the Controller, but afterwards they are assured that Ghidorah, known to the Planet X people as Monster Zero, is gone. The Controller asks for Earth's help: they want to capture, the monsters known to the Planet X people as Monster Zero-One and Monster Zero-Two Godzilla and Rodan. In return, Planet X will give humanity a wonder drug that can cure all diseases. The astronauts agree to return home with the proposal. As they lift off, they say on the radio to the Controller, ""We're glad we found friends on Planet X."" Meanwhile, Fuji's sister's boyfriend, Tetsuo, has invented a personal alarm he thinks women could use if they're attacked. It creates an extremely loud noise that can be heard for a long distance. Tetsuo wonders, though, why no one is interested in buying it. Eventually, a Miss Namikawa makes an offer to buy the alarm as an educational device, though she keeps putting Tetsuo off on completing the deal. In truth, her boss wants the device and the plans destroyed. Fuji and Glenn tell their superiors about the offer from Planet X. Scientists begin searching for Godzilla and Rodan. The Controller of Planet X suddenly makes an appearance on Earth, and both Glenn, who is dating Miss Namikawa and Fuji both become suspicious of Planet X. The Controller apologizes for his unannounced presence and offers to help locate the two monsters. Two Planet X spacecraft rapidly deploy to capture the two monsters. Glenn, Fuji and Dr. Sakurai are invited to accompany the Controller back to Planet X, a trip that takes only a few hours; the Controller says that soon they'll be able to travel at the speed of light. Tetsuo is unhappy his device is not being used, and he is unable to get Miss Namikawa to tell him what's happening. He decides to follow her, but is captured by Planet X soldiers. When they reach Planet X, there is an immediate attack by Ghidorah, and the two monsters from Earth are released to battle him. Ghidorah is driven off and the Controller is extremely happy. He presents the astronauts with a box he says contains the formula for the miracle drug. He also gives the three men duplicate of their spaceship so they can fly home. Back home the box is taken to a special meeting and in it is found a reel-to-reel tape. It is loaded to play, but when the speakers remain silent for a long period, some wonder if the systems are compatible. Finally, after a beep a voice states, ""I am the controller of Planet X to the people of the Earth. I command that you obey the following orders."" It is to surrender to the people of Planet X. Glenn eventually discovers Miss Namikawa is from Planet X and all their women are virtually identical. Fearing what he knows, the Planet X people arrest him and put in the same cell as Tetsuo. However, this proves to be their undoing as he and Tetsuo begin to cooperate. The Planet X people soon arrives and destroys the gift spacecraft. They regret that they haven't heard any comply they decide to conquer the earth also they have stationed King Ghidorah in the western hemisphere the Controller states that King Ghidorah was already under their control by magnetic waves with Godzilla and Rodan now under there control. The Controller has delayed orders of destruction for 24 hours their last chance. The Earth scientists know they can exploit this information and work rapidly to find a way to disrupt the waves. Before she is disintegrated by a soldier, Namikawa gives Glenn a letter in which she told him the weakness of the people of Planet X: the sound from Tetsuo's alarm. Tetsuo, who still has the prototype, sets it off. It paralyzes the Planet X soldiers, enabling Glenn and Tetsuo to escape. They reach the space center scientists and explain about the alarm. Within 21 hours the Planet X people decide to begin Earths destruction by unleashing Godzilla, Rodan and King Ghidorah onto Tokyo. Earth's armies fight the three monsters with conventional weapons as they destroy much of Japan. Arrangements are made to broadcast it on all radio and television stations, but only when the magnetic disruption devices are deployed. The Planet X people feel the pain of the alarm and try to withdraw from the Earth but there spacecraft explode as their crews try to escape the debilitating alarm noise the invaders. With the invaders spaceship destroyed the three monsters are no longer under Planet X control. Godzilla and Rodan attack King Ghidorah, forcing all three to fall into the sea. Ghidorah emerges and retreats to outer space, but Godzilla and Rodan never resurface, leading the humans to wonder whether King Ghidorah killed them. Glenn and Fuji are to be sent to Planet X again as ambassadors to seek peaceful relations.

English Version: The opening theme was changed, and some of Akira Ifukube's score was re-arranged. Several sound effects were also added. Deleted: Several shots of Godzilla's foot stepping on houses and huts. Some short shots of flying saucers. Rodan blowing away tanks from the top of a hill. Several scenes with the Xiliens speaking in the language of Planet X. Scene where Godzilla does his dance, that scene has stomping noises in the English version, while in the Japanese version there isn't. The English version runs 93 minutes, three minutes shorter than the Japanese version. In the original Japanese version of the film, the drug the Xiliens promised was a cure for all forms of cancer. However, in the English version of the film, the cure was for all forms of disease (perhaps due to a translation mistake).

Characters: The characters are new the aliens are good for villains but wish we had more info on how they got Ghidorah under their control. I love the reactions of the Monsters after they are not under alien control Godzilla gets up from the ground and seeing Ghidorah on earth kicks at a rock at him with Ghidorah getting up question what he doing on earth and seeing Godzilla again wonders why he was here.

Monsters: Ghidorah is same in the last film as well as Rodan. Godzilla was given minor changes but so far no problems yet.

2793712,4,B000OCY7IK,"An enjoyable, ""monster-flik, "" but as pointed out in other reviews, the film plays down the role of the monsters. Of course, one does not expect great art from one of these fantastic productions, but instead the indulgence of an acquired taste. Viewers, in general, who do not understand the enthusiasm for Godzilla and the rest of the menagerie, would probably consider others who seem to take the films seriously at all as suffering under some kind of mental deficiency. Well, be that as it may be...the in-crowd does not have to explain - just enjoy.  Beside the lack of monster action, another objection to the film  is the high resolution and brilliant colors - which largely remove the ""dream-like"" quality captured by ""Godzilla Raids Again"" and similar earlier productions. One power of these earlier films is the grainy, black and white aspects  induce a mental state akin to a ""Night Terror,""  where the partial paralysis of the logical, prefrontal lobes of the brain allows the irrational limbic system to generate so much delightful nonsense. ""Invasion of the Astro Monster"" does not have this power, and is therefore a completely different experience, where the skeptical point of view gains credence. Possibly, the creators of the film either did not understand this aspect of the film's effects, or were catering to viewers who thought if a film were not in color, ""something was inferior,"" and not worth watching. A third possible objection might be that the characters in the earlier films had a child-like quality about them - much like that in myths and fairy tales: The men impossible incons of virtue, and the women saturated with the sweetness of feminine simplicity, and doll-like beauty, traits no longer in vogue today. In summary, one might say the film is enjoyable for the ""completist,"" but does not serve as the basis of convincing doubters of the charm of Monster Movies.",1409961600,,1900,4.965408805031447

2793720,5,B000OCY7IK,"This is a personal favorite among Godzilla films despite not actually being the best showing for Godzilla himself (the 1954 original remains in a more-serious class above all others).

Godzilla (kind of a showy pugilist in this one), Rodan, and King Ghidorah of course have some fighting to do and later in the film wreck quite a bit of the Japanese countryside.  But the real entertainment of Invasion of Astro-Monster (or ""Godzilla vs Monster Zero"" as I first came to know it) comes from the entertaining sci-fi storyline and actor camaraderie. This is especially the case with Nick Adams as Astronaut Glenn and his spicy interaction with the ever-attractive Kumi Mizuno, playing the mysterious Miss Namikawa. The Planet X aliens are also immensely memorable, designed and acted with a fun 60's sci-fi flamboyance.

The DVD package itself is surprisingly well-produced. Nicely presented menus start with a front end offering either the English or Japanese language versions, both of which are agreeable.  From there a new menu arrives offering the feature, an informative optional commentary running over the movie, and an art gallery.",1402704000,2,1137,5.230769230769231
2793721,5,B000OCY7IK,"Well, on Blu ray would be nice but until then this EPIC Japanese classic looks pretty darn good on this DVD. This is my all time favorite 60s Japanese sci-fi movie. Toho got American funding for this one and they spent it well on some excellent special effects, fantastic sets, great matte shots, and beautifully designed miniatures. This is NOT a ""guys in rubber suits stomping on Tokyo"" movie, nor is it high art; it is rather a well shot and totally fun slice of cheese with some true characters in it, something rare in this genre. Starting with the boys from Planet X and their way-cool attitudes and outfits, the ever fetching and evil Miss Namikawa, Nick Adam's swaggering American tough-guy routine, and a comic-relief Nerdlinger inventor with a GF who is far too cute for him, there is some actual character development. The flight and adventures to and on Planet X are the high points of the film. They are very VERY well done, the effects, sets and miniatures are the best I have ever seen in a Japanese movie from the 60s. It is a little long and loses some punch in the last 30 minutes; 94 minutes is about 20 too long, but that is my only complaint. When you can get DVDs in widescreen, or in the original 4:3 aspect ratio (as opposed to the dreadful ""full screen"" treatment) and watch them on a modern BD player they can have I would say, scientifically speaking, ""pretty good"" (LOL) image quality and this is a good example.",1402358400,3,1440,4.521072796934866

A really good story that has a pretty interesting plot in it involving space exploration, first contact with alien life, and flying-saucer-bound alien invaders. The effects were pretty good too. What let this movie down was three things - 1: This film was more kid friendly than the previous ones; I will never forget the terribly cheesy victory dance performed by Godzilla after his first defeat of Ghidorah. 2: It's got all the same monsters in it from the previous film, minus one. It's got both Ghidorah (AKA: Monster Zero) and Rodan, but now no Mothra. 3: And the way mankind managed to defeat the alien invaders was silly to say the least.

However, I was still entertained by this one none the least, and it would certainly satisfy any hardcore Godzilla fan. But it was a step down from the previous films and heads into a more campy direction.",1402185600,,899,4.689873417721519

2793726,3,B000OCY7IK,"""Invasion of the Astro Monster"" (Released in the US as ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"".) is a so-so entry in the original Toho Studio Godzilla series.

In this film, a joint American/Japanese space mission makes its way to the newly discovered Planet X (The writers of this film must have seen the classic Warner Brothers cartoon ""Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century"".).  The two man space crew and their ship are suddenly taken away by the inhabitants of the planet.  The aliens soon make contact with Earth and ask them for help in warding off the marauding monster known as King Ghidorah.  They ask Earth to allow them to transport the Earth monsters Godzilla and Rodan to Planet X to fight off Ghidorah.  In exchange, the Planet X aliens will give Earth's scientists the cure for cancer.  The world leaders on Earth quickly agree.  The spaceship is released and returns to Earth.  With the help of the aliens Godzilla and Rodan are taken to Planet X where they sucessfully fight Ghidorah.  However, once the Earth astronauts return to Earth (Leaving Godzilla and Rodan behind unsure if they are doing the right thing.), the aliens reveal their real intentions.  The cure for cancer given to Earth is a fake.  Instead it's an audio recording stating that Earth must surrender to Planet X (Who plan to colonize Earth and rule it's inhabitants.) or Godzilla, Rodan (Who are now being controlled by the aliens by magnetic waves.) and Ghidorah will destroy the whole planet.  In Japan, some of the countries leading scientists struggle to find a way to release Godzilla and Rodan from Planet X's control and drive the invaders off.

While I was never bored in watching ""Invasion of the Astro Monster"" I found myself not really being swept up by the movie as I have been with ""Gojira"" (Godzilla:  King of the Monsters"".) and Ebirah:  Horror of the Deep (""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster."").  The Planet X aliens look too goofy to be taken seriously.  Yes, it is true that many Godzilla movies are loaded with cheesy special effects and cornball makeup, but with this movie those idyosincracies hurt this movie more than it does others.

Still despite that, you will at least be entertained if you do see it.  Remember to watch the movie in the original Japanese (The same can be said for all the Godzilla movies.).  It will make you enjoy this good, but average movie, a little bit more.",1393804800,2,2377,4.723300970873787

The film has a pretty interesting story about aliens taking over Earth and using the monsters to help them conquer us. This film also marks the first time Godzilla does his little victory dance/Jig.

These films were being made and shown in theaters when I was a child and they were hugely popular.  The trailer for this and ""War of the Gargantuas"" made the movies look like so much fun, and they are.

I had only seen this as a 16mm pan and scan on TV, so seeing it widescreen and in razor sharp clarity, bright colors and clean sound was really something.  It's great Saturday afternoon TV viewing and plays equally well late on a weekend evening.

You have to be in the mood for something like this, but if you are it's a nice bit of escapism.  The monster scenes and special effects are all good and the music lends an air of mystery.  Nick Adams does very well, too.

My shipment arrived quickly and in GREAT shape. The film had excellent packaging, plus some terrific extra features for die-hard monster/fantasy fans. Upon viewing, I realized that INVASION OF THE ASTRO MONSTER (MONSTER ZERO) is one of the BEST of Toho's 1960's era of films (often referred to the last of their 'Golden Era' of film production.) When I first remember seeing this film, it was in the early 1970's, and it 'bothered' me that an American Actor was included and seemed to distract from the action. Of course, now I've grown up, some of my tastes has changed, as well as expanded. Since then, I've really come to appreciate NICK ADAMS in a number of performances, and have become quite a fan. NOW I see ASTRO MONSTER and think - what could be COOLER than one of my favorite actors in a GODZILLA film? Creative special effects, expansive, beautiful set design, wonderful, large-scale musical score and lots of monster action make this a terrific summer film for anyone who enjoys monster/fantasy and sci-fi films of any era.

2793742,3,B000OCY7IK,"I love this film, always have enjoyed it ever since I was a young kid and watching it on TV in the 1970s (usually on Saturday afternoons). It's wonderfully dated and campy - the stilted 1960s lines, the cute little model tanks and airplanes with the whisps of smoke coming from their cute little gun barrels when they fired, the Japanese-dubbed-into-English dialogue, with the actors' lips moving followed by it coming out as: ""Golly!"" or the ever-popular and classic: ""H'OHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!""

Saw it on Amazon and just had to have it. It helped me re-create a fond memory from my childhood, when I would be camped out in front of the TV (which did have a cable connection - rare in our neighborhood at the time in Northern California - but which still relied on the rabbit-ears antenna) on Saturday mornings and afternoons with a plate full of munchies, avidly watching the Sci-FI Thriller movie.",1375056000,,896,4.818181818181818

2793747,5,B000OCY7IK,"A pair of astronauts encounter an alien civilization while exploring the unknown Planet X. The Xians request their aid in fending off Monster Zero, known on Earth as King Ghidorah, and ask to borrow Earth's mightiest monsters in order to defeat him. After constructing a plan, Godzilla and Rodan are shipped off to Planet X, but something nefarious is at foot... In truth, the Xians plan to control the monsters using magnetic waves in an effort to conquer the planet, and it will take all of Earth's forces to stop them! This sixth film in the Godzilla series introduces more science fiction elements than ever before in a space-opera of epic proportions. American actor Nick Adams would co-star as Astronaut Glenn Amer in Toho's continuing effort to reach a widening audience over seas. Adams is joined by Akira Takarada, and together they make an enjoyable team on screen. Once the monsters return to Earth under the control of the Xians, the destruction and carnage is unmatched as they obliterate more of Eiji Tsuburaya's finely-made models. In a moment that fans are unlikely to forget (or forgive), Godzilla performs a child-like victory dance after he and Rodan first defeat Ghidorah while on the surface of Planet X. INVASION OF THE ASTRO-MONSTER is another excellent sequel and an important stepping stone in the evolution of the Godzilla series.

2793751,5,B000OCY7IK,"In 1966, Toho signed on American Actor Nick Adams to play one of the two astronauts in this movie in.  For those who don't know, Nick Admas was an American actor who previously acted in a number of American westerns.  He starred as the character Johnny Yuma in the ABC Western TV series ""The Rebel"" (1960 to 1962).  Toho also cast him as a scientist in ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"" (1967).

In February 7, 1968, actor Nick Adams met with an untimely death due to an overdose of prescription drugs.  A science fictin movie he was wich was made in 1967 ""Mission Mars"" was relased in 1968 after his death.

Japanese actress, Kumi Mizuno, also appears in the movie as a sultry space diva sent by the the evil space aliens bent on conquering the earth as a spy.  She was to seduces Nicka Adams' character, but things backfie when the space diva ends up falling for him.

Also, the voices do not match the faces of the actors and the voices have a very unreal quality.

2793753,4,B000OCY7IK,"Out of print for almost a decade in the United States, Classic Media has finally released another of Godzilla's more highly regarded productions to DVD with their best release yet. Sporting a great video presentation, a solid audio offering, and a familiar variety of extras, there is a lot to praise about this particular disc that leaves high hopes for future offerings from the company. Quite simply the best video quality from Classic Media to date, this disc offers a great presentation of the movie. From the minute the Toho logo appeared on the screen, with a wonderful array of colors and with a good level of detail, I knew I was in for a treat. This impression stuck through most of the feature as well, as the source was devoid of scratches, featured little grain and boasted a very distinct level of colors. To be fair, there are moments in the movie where the color is a little off, typically tinted slightly brown or yellow which was a common trait on Toho's earlier region 2 releases, but it's fairly minor problem when all is said and done. In terms of the US release, there are some mixed things to note. First off, like the firm's Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster DVD, the US version here has primarily been reconstructed from the restored Japanese print already available on this release. Classic Media has done the right thing, though, in including sequences which differ from that print from the original US version, such as: the opening titles, the riot sequences with overlapping English headlines and ""The End"". Unfortunately, the US print used appears to be in fairly awful condition, as it's discolored, has a lot of print damage and the frame is also sometimes unstable. Still, it's preferable that it try to keep with the presentation of the original cut as much as possible, and in that regard they succeeded, even editing the movie to directly match the removed scenes from the US version. As for the quality, it's, expectantly on par with the Japanese version already present, sans the few scenes taken from a US version source. The main difference is the level of compression apparent in the two, as the US one looks very soft in contrast. It's not a deal breaker, although just the same it's still clear that of the two the Japanese one found in this set is clearly superior. Invasion of Astro-Monster is presented in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 across the two versions, and is Anamorphic for widescreen TVs. The disc boasts two different audio tracks, both tied to their respective versions. The first is the Japanese track, which is also available in its original mono format. The quality is more or less superb, given the limitations of the format, as the dialogue is clear while there are no overt inconsistencies. The track can also be accompanied with, removable, English subtitles. Unfortunately, the subtitles are a little ""iffy"" in places, and could certainly have done with another proof reading before release, as it features things like: ""Plane X"" and ""Deploy Monster Zero and mount strongest attack"". Thankfully, the errors are generally of the typo variety, so they shouldn't interfere with the enjoyment of the movie too much. As for the English dub track, it also gets fairly high marks, again taking into consideration the limitations of a mono track. Overall, dialogue is clear while nothing stands out as being particularly off in the track, which is a solid improvement over the dubbed track available on the company's Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster release.
This disc continues with the variety of supplemental content found on previous releases from Classic Media. This includes a short video feature biography, this time of producer and one time Toho president Tomoyuki Tanaka. Like before, this feature is voiced by Ed Godziszewski, who covers a lot of detail on the life and career of Tanaka leading up to his death in 1997. Also, like with previous biographies in this line, the feature is complimented with a number of production stills, poster and other images. Next up are a pair of galleries, the first of which focuses on posters, both from initial and re-releases, and the other on various production stills and promotional images. Both of these features also come with a brief amount of text to explain the current picture, which is navigated with the remote. The disc also has the movie's trailer in its 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Unfortunately, the quality of the trailer is pretty lacking. Apparently, they decided to go with a trailer for the movie's re-release, as the advert sports the ""King Ghidorah vs. Godzilla"" subtitle that was added later. In terms of what's off with the trailer, well a multitude of things, including a noticeable brown tint, a ton of print damage and a very apparent blue line to the left of the image. For whatever reason, the trailer is also not anamorphic. Anyway, the last supplement on this DVD is an audio commentary track, again attached to the US version of the movie. This time, the commentary is done by author Stuart Galbraith, who provides a great deal of insight into the production with a good paced delivery through out. My only problem with the audio track was a fairly awkward minute plus break, which starts around the 23 minute mark and takes awhile to pick back up again. At first I thought it might have been a mistake, but it seems to be intentional.
Bottom line, this release is the best from the company to date for the Godzilla films. Something that can be attributed largely to the superior video quality compared to other offerings from the firm, and one that easily blows the Simitar Godzilla Versus Monster Zero release out of the water. Hopefully, the four remaining Toho titles from Classic Media maintain this level of quality.",1325635200,,5764,4.8646998982706

2793757,3,B000OCY7IK,"Invasion of Astro Monster(released Dec/65) is another average entry in the Godzilla series of flicks from Toho Studios in Japan. This film,like the original,has an added American actor by the name of Nick Adams. He is remembered best for his short lived TV show The Rebel as Johnny Yuma. Real success eluded Adams and he died a scant three years after this film was released at age 36.
The story here is a complicated one going from plot to sub plot,to sub plot and back to plot again. Basically we find that scientists have discovered a new planet orbiting Jupiter which they call Planet X.Two astronauts are dispatched and soon after they land life is discovered,or,in point of fact,life discovers them. The inhabitants look like members of the 80s rock group DEVO(sans hats)and they tell the pair that they are forced to live underground due to a creature which regularly comes by,destroying everything it sees. The creature in question turns out to be King Ghodirah(so that's where he went after Rodan and Godzilla kicked his butt in the last film!).The inhabitants want to bring Rodan and Godzilla to the planet to take care of Ghodirah so they may return to the surface. In exchange they offer to give Earth a cure for cancer.
The astronauts return home with the offer from Planet X.Doubts surface as to the legitimacy of the offer but it is so enticing that they go along with it. Planet X's people know exactly where Rodan and Godzilla are and come with their spaceships to collect them and return them to their home. When they arrive at Planet X the monsters go to work and take care of Ghodirah and send him packing temporarily. Earth is given the cure on a tape but when they play it it is actually a demand to surrender Earth to them as a colony. The inhabitants of Planet X have had a fifth column working secretly all along on Earth and with their assistance they put their dastardly scheme into action. To keep Earth people in line they bring back Ghodirah,Rodan and Godzilla. The latter two are controlled electronically,doing Planet X's biding against their will.
Science comes to bear on the problem and they develop an electromagnetic beam which disrupts the flight of Planet X's spacecraft(familiar to fans of Earth VS Flying Saucers) and they also use a small audio device which emanates a sound the X-men cannot bear. Between the sound and the beam they are defeated. With Godzilla and Rodan now free of electronic bondage,they again team up to kick some much needed Ghodirah butt and send him packing(for good?).The film ends with everyone wondering where Godzilla and Rodan might be and if they will return. Of course they will.
Like with many of the movies of this series,as it progressed the plots tended to become more cumbersome and the fight scenes instead of being intense end up being more hilarious than not. For example there is a moment where Godzilla is going monster e' monster against Ghidorah. Godzilla is punching/boxing the three heads of Ghodirah like Mohammed Ali,fists clenched and right down to the fancy footwork! One cannot help but laugh. Unfortunately it works against ones suspension of disbelief as a ""serious"" situation(as per the plot)and the fight becomes cartoon-ish,working against itself.
Then again,maybe its makers intended it that way.....??
Technically the movie is in its original w/s a/r and the transfer is wonderful;clear and crisp. Extras include:Both Japanese and the American versions,commentary,an image and slide show gallery,the trailer and a small featurette on director Tanaka. Of course the Japanese version is longer and is the more compelling of the two. An aside:This Japanese versions' English subtitles,as with other such versions in this series,is full of grammatical and spelling faux paux's. It would also seems that whoever did this(a Japanese interpreter into English or an English one from the Japanese),they didn't get the phraseology down quite to what it should have been at times. A minor concern admittedly.
All in all a recommended release of a passable film from Toho studios,but the release itself,like all the others in this series,deserves around a 4-4 1/2 star rating for what it brings to the table(both versions,the extras,etc).However,in the big picture,mostly of interest to film buffs of this genre.",1305763200,,4299,4.988857938718663

Throw in a some heavy duty sonic waves, the Japanese army, a semi love story involving clones, and a mean ole group of non earthlings who covet our digs and whahlah..the result is a king sized battle that doesnt necessarily end in death.

2793762,2,B000OCY7IK,"Classic Media's newest line of Godzilla DVD have been hit and miss, excelling in some areas, falling flat in others and this film is no exception. The film itself is a fairly decent movie but the DVD, even when compared to Classic Media's previous releases, feels slightly neglected.

The prints for the film (both Japanese and American versions) are in excellent shape. There was very little in the way of grain, hairs or other blemishes. Then again, this film unlike earlier Godzilla films was minimally altered during the ""Americanization"" process.

The problem is for me is with the audio. While technically there's nothing wrong with it, the Japanese version has Nick Adams dubbed in Japanese. Personally I would have liked to hear the international version (like Godzilla Final Wars) with Adams speaking in English (yes he was reading an English language script when he filmed his scenes) while everyone else speaks Japanese and is subtitled. The subtitles also have a flaw; in one scene a person notices the alien's flying saucer but the subtitles read ""a fling saucer"". This kind of carelessness should have be corrected before the release.

The special features are the same as the previous releases. The main flaws in my opinion are: the Japanese trailer and the audio commentary. The trailer is for the 1970's reissue of the film in Japan as it carries the reissued title Kaiju Daisensou: Kingu Gidora tai Gojira (Large Monster Wars: King Ghidorah vs. Godzilla [I hope I've got it right]), while the original film was simply called Kaiju Daisensou . The audio commentary is done by Stuart Galbraith. There are numerous moments of silence in the commentary and I find when he does speak he spends too much time talking about the actors: Character X was played by so-and-so, who stared in this film and that film and this other film and that other film. While some may find this interesting I'd like to hear more about the behind-the-scenes of the movie and not someone reading the casts various resumes.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the movie and recomend this to any Godzila fan, die hard or casual but Classic Media could have done a much better job with this film. As I said on other reviews of Godzilla DVDs, it seems like Classic Media thinks we want the Japanese cut of the film so badly that nothing else on the DVD will matter.",1268006400,,2345,4.782716049382716
2793763,4,B000OCY7IK,"Classic Media presents another first-class release with Invasion of the Astro Monster (Kaiju Daisenso), a.k.a. Monster Zero, its 1970 U.S. theatrical release title (in fact, the U.S. version on this DVD retains the Monster Zero title), a.k.a. Godzilla vs. Monster Zero, its U.S. television/video release title.

When I was a youngster, I caught the double-feature release of War of the Gargantuas/Monster Zero at our local theater, and the pair made a more powerful impression on me than just about any other film experience to that time. Perhaps strangely, given my special fondness for Godzilla, I then preferred War of the Gargantuas--and still do, for that matter. Like all of Toho's fantasy-oriented daikaiju films of the 1960s, Monster Zero is quite silly, and ever since childhood, I've preferred my monsters played straight, as in the original 1954 Godzilla. But Monster Zero is undeniably a colorful, action-packed, superbly crafted monster flick that features some of Eiji Tsuburaya's most accomplished special effects work (if also, sadly, some of his least). Much as its predecessor (Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster), the greater part of the movie revolves around its people scenes, which can be highly disheartening for a young monster enthusiast; fortunately, in both films, the human story plays out as fun and engaging--even more so in Monster Zero than in Ghidrah.

In the same way that Ghidrah maintained some direct continuity with its predecessor (Mothra vs. Godzilla), Monster Zero's script, by veteran screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa, builds on some of the dramatic cues from Ghidrah, such as the Godzilla-Rodan tag team that previously defeated Ghidrah--though there's no mention of Mothra, who played a pivotal monster role in the earlier film. Although Toho had already used the space-aliens-invade-Earth theme in prior films, such as The Mysterians and Battle in Outer Space, Monster Zero is the first (of soon-to-be many) that directly involve Godzilla. When Monster Zero came to the theater in 1970, I had already seen Destroy All Monsters, and with its similar but somewhat grimmer storyline and distinctly superior depictions of the monsters--Godzilla in particular--I naturally felt Monster Zero rather lacking in comparison. In retrospect, however, Monster Zero contains many finer elements, particularly the great chemistry between Nick Adams as Mister Astronaut Glenn and Akira Takarada as Astronaut Fuji. Although Monster Zero boasts fewer special effects scenes than in Destroy All Monsters, the monsters' rampages, particularly King Ghidorah's, stand out as among Toho's all-time best.

In Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster, the monster battles were played for laughs to a greater extent than in any previous Toho daikaiju film, with the possible exception of King Kong vs. Godzilla. Monster Zero continues the trend of anthropomorphizing the terrestrial monsters, though the humorous moments tend to be somewhat more palatable here than in Ghidrah--particularly since the monster interactions contain a few more ""straight"" moments. Design-wise, the Godzilla suit constructed for Monster Zero doesn't fare as well as the ""Mosu-Goji"" costume used in Mothra vs. Godzilla and Ghidrah, but the Rodan suit looks somewhat better, especially when shown in the distance and in flight. In the audio commentary of Classic Media's Ghidrah release, author David Kalat posits that the original, ""demonic""-looking Rodan suit from 1957's Rodan, the Flying Monster would have been out of place in such a light-hearted fantasy, and there may be something to this; however, if it were up to me, I would have happily seen the original Rodan costume duplicated for these films. Then again, they didn't ask me (possibly because I was very young at the time and didn't work for Toho).

The lighter tone for these films was established by screenwriter Sekizawa and effects director Tsuburaya, whose penchant for entertaining young people was, by this point in their careers, firmly cemented so that it essentially became Toho policy. Yet director Ishiro Honda felt--as I always have--that the monsters should have maintained the dignity of their great stature. He was pained by scenes of Godzilla acting a clown and bouncing ludicrously in a ""shie"" dance after overcoming King Ghidorah on Planet X. Would that Honda's attitude might have prevailed.

Although the Japanese and American versions of Monster Zero are almost identical, the Japanese version is arguably superior (with a couple of possible exceptions). In the U.S. version Akira Ifukube's opening theme--a rousing military march based on the depth charge attack motif from the original Godzilla--has been replaced by the far more ominous-sounding track, titled ""The Electromagnetic Capsule,"" from later in the film, to much better effect. And during Godzilla's aforementioned ""shie"" jig, the roars and booming sound effects in the American version offer at least some slight improvement to the otherwise ridiculous and utterly useless scene. However, a handful of special effects scenes--good ones--were excised from the American cut, and, more significantly, a number of lines in ""X-ian"" language, improvised by Yoshio Tsuchiya as the Controller of Planet X, were also cut.

Both the U.S. and Japanese prints on the Classic Media DVD are of very good quality, far better than the one used on the Simitar release of Godzilla vs. Monster Zero from 1998. As for extra features, the most noteworthy is kaiju authority Stuart Galbraith's informative commentary on the U.S. version. Additionally, the bio documentary of Tomoyuki Tanaka, narrated by Mr. Ed Godziszewski, is highly enjoyable. For Godzilla fans, this release of Monster Zero is a necessity, and I imagine that even more casual monster movie viewers will really have a good time with this one.",1265500800,,5827,5.4402654867256635
2793764,3,B000OCY7IK,"""Invasion of Astro-Monster"" (or ""Monster Zero"" as the title card claims) is a decent little sci-fi movie. It is a Godzilla movie....to a degree. While ""Astro Monster"" does feature Ghidorah, Godzilla and Rodan, the creatures take a back seat to the main villains in the film, the invading aliens from Planet X. The evil space men want to take over the earth and plan on using the terrible trio of monsters to do so.

This is actually a decent little movie, if you enjoy simple 1960's sci-fi. The storyline of invading aliens using our monsters against us is pretty innovative, and an interesting way to utilize these already familiar critters in a new way. If you are looking for non-stop rubber-suited monsters fighting then this won't be the film for you. The monsters are used more as props, and only take up about 20 minutes of screentime. The majority of the film is focused on the two astronauts who work to stop the alien invasion.

While Godzilla flicks aren't exactly known for their character development, ""Astro Monster"" is the exception to that rule. The relationship between the two astronauts and the budding romance between an inventor and one of the astronaut's sister form the backbone of film. While not great if you want repeated scenes of Tokyo getting demolished, not bad if you want a little more storyline with you giant lizard mayhem. Plus I liked the special effects, the monsters look good when they are used, the destruction raining down from the invading saucers looked cool as well.

So really it all depends on what your looking for, some giant monster fights - go to another title. Some fun 60's sci-fi with some monster scenes sprinkled in..give this one a shot.",1262736000,,1693,4.791095890410959
2793765,2,B000OCY7IK,"Invasion of the Astro Monster, a.k.a. Godzilla vs. Monster Zero, a.k.a. Invasion of the Astros, a.k.a. Monster Zero, a.k.a. War of the Monsters, a.k.a The Great Monster War, is a direct sequel to the superior Ghidorah: the Three Headed Monster, released the previous year in 1964.

The plot concerns a toy spaceship that leaves a painting of Earth and lands on a set that looks like an alien planet.  This set is inhabited by guys wearing black and grey tights who want to ""borrow"" Godzilla and Rodan to defeat Ghidorah, who is currently ravaging their set.  Models of Godzilla and Rodan are transported by toy UFOs to the outer space set, where they fight Ghidorah in a brief battle.  Unfortunately, those men in black and grey tights weren't totally honest about their intentions, and...well, you can pretty much guess where the plot is going.

Monster Zero is a fleeting and mildly amusing film.  Its monster scenes are brief and sometimes contain stock footage from the previous entry, so it's simply not impressive from a visual standpoint.  The space sets and effects are atrocious, even for a mid-60s film, with strings clearly visible on many of the props.  Eiji Tsuburaya, though he may be an effects pioneer, was never any good when it came to space scenes.  The film's human and alien scenes are campy in the extreme, but enjoyable due to an out-of-control performance by Nick Adams as the heroic astronaut Glenn.  Even wackier is a subplot involving alien agents infiltrating a toy company (seriously).  Kumi Mizuno, who would become a series regular, makes her debut as the memorable Miss Namikawa, and the instantly recognizable Akira Takarada is on hand as astronaut Fuji.

Despite its likable human characters, Monster Zero does not hold up well overall.  Its monster scenes are excessively silly, the visual effects are often laughable, and the plot is so inept that it's amazing it ever got greenlit.  Though it's gained a cult reputation over the decades, Monster Zero just isn't that good a film.",1262563200,,2016,4.92603550295858

2793771,5,B000OCY7IK,"When I was a child i only had my parents' word as to whether or not certain films were worth watching. Godzilla, the original b&w classic, was apparently my mother's favorite. i watched it with certain degrees of enthusiasm. Later my enthusiasm grew when one of the local stations in my town started showing these classic films on Saturday afternoons. With my dad watching them with me, talking for the monsters so that I knew what they were saying (and believe me they were very foul mouthed towards each other), I fell in love with these. As i got older, I learned more of the histories behind these classics, and soon became a huge fan wanting not only the movies, but the chance to watch them in their original japanese to see what differences there were.

All I can say is that another American made it into this film to star along with the Japanese. The villains are poorly dressed, have Elton John sized sunglasses, all look the same, and are hell bent on making sure that they never really get around to telling the truth. It involves Rodan, Godzilla, Ghidorah, and of course, mind control.

Monster Zero is the 6th of the Godzilla series...and one of the most colorful and enjoyable. It finds the Godzilla series and TOHO at its near peak of creative powers...providing a wild, colorful comic book style Godzilla science fiction epic. The plot is familiar to Godzilla fans, so no need to recap it here. The film has a lot going for it...from its wild pop sci fi look, to plentiful monster battles...hissable aliens in full DEVO dress, great cinematography and music, and some fine effects. That is not to say there are not some problems. Rodan is as goofy looking as ever, and would have to wait for 1993s GODZIILLA vs MECHA GODZILLA to regain some dignity. Godzilla's dance o' joy on planet X is groan inducing  (Director Honda hated the change of Godzilla into a campy anthropomorphic character, but was over ruled by Tsuburaya and producer Tanaka...too bad) and the film has way too much clumsy and obvious stock footage inserted. Some from RODAN and MOTHRA) and the plot is ludicrous...but the film is such fun that it overcomes these issues to be one of the  best of Godzilla's 1960s adventures.

The film also includes a commentary track, as do all the classic media releases. This one is done by Stuart Galbraith  author of the excellent and recommended books "" Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films"" and"" The Emperor and the Wolf, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune."" The commentary is fact filled....but also  deadly dull. Names and dates are provided...but the commentary seems too mannered...too paced...and without a trace of the joy and fun of the film that it accompanied. One can almost hear the pages being turned as Galbraith speaks....not really conducive to a pleasurable listening experience. One longs for a commentary like the ones Tom Weaver has provided on films like THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and THE WOLFMAN. Those commentaries and both informative and very entertaining. If only more were of that quality. Of the classic media releases...all suffer the same problem, with comments that seem like a laundry list of names and dates. Only the commentary on the GHIDRAH DVD escapes this problem...being almost too enthusiastic...but it is still far more interesting and entertaining. It is however still better than the commentary on the MOTHRA vs GODZIILLA DVD. That one seemed too fawning over the film and its creators.
