2879690,4,6304097050,"Ali was one of the best fighters of all time. And this 90 minute documentary captures some of his greatest moments - the title winning victory over Liston, his captivating interviews with the press, and still photographs of his 1974 win over George Foreman.
This video has been eclipsed by more recent documentaries such as the the 6 video set ""Muhammad Ali: The Whole Story,"" ""The Fights and Times of Muhammad Ali,"" the ESPN Sports Century one hour documentary, and a number of others. If you have those, you don't need this. But if all you want is one 90 minute video, this will do fine.",1034380800,2,589,4.566037735849057
2879691,4,6304097050,"This video however flawed contains in my opinion the best boxing footage you will ever see. This is simply because as a diehard boxing fan Sugar Ray Robinson is the closest thing to the perfect boxer that I have ever seen. Although if you were to use one word to describe Sugar Ray I think the perfect word would be: dynamic. This is because as this video will show you Sugar Ray was as dynamic a person as he was a fighter. Although most of Sugar Ray's fights in his prime no longer exist this one shows many of his greatest battles (nearly all of which take place in Sugar Ray's thirties).
RIP Sugar Ray you're still the greatest.",1027900800,4,632,4.319327731092437
2879692,5,6304097050,"Sugar Ray Robinson is considered by many to be the greatest boxer/fighter of all time, and I couldn't agree more. I don't tend to follow the trends or fads, or just agree with people for the sake of fitting in, but I'll tell you, he was truly the best that's ever done it.  This video is interesting.  It contains clips from a lot of Sugar Ray Robinson's fights, and even includes some footage of a few of his matches before turning pro. That's some good, old footage.  You simply can't go wrong with this video.  A lot of the video features Sugar Ray Robinson discussing his career, but it's him ""now,"" many years after his last ever boxing match.  This film was probably made sometime in the 1970's, I would assume, so that's the ""now"" I'm refering to.  It's nice to see that Ray Robinson looks good after all of those fights.  To me, he looks and sounds good, and even seems a bit nostalgic as he journeys back to the days of his boxing glory.
This video is one way for you to have an important film, containg important footage, of The Greatest Boxer/Fighter Of All Time.  Sugar Ray Robinson seems timeless, in a sport that's been around long before him, and has continued long after he left it. He's still the greatest!",1007337600,4,1223,4.428571428571429
2879693,5,6304097050,"Can't think of anyone to compare with Sugar Ray Robinson. He had
blazing hand and foot speed, knockout power in both hands, good
defense, excellent chin, excellent conditioning. More heart than
anyone in the game. He fought the best fighters in their prime-
win or lose. On top of all that, he was a CLASS ACT. Cool and
dignified. A must have tape for any boxing fan, trainer,or fighter. Experience the best ever ""POUND FOR POUND"" !!!",1005868800,2,434,4.64935064935065
2879694,5,6304097050,"Although I haven't purchased this video, I recently hired it from the local video shop. Previous to watching this video I had only heard the name Sugar Ray Robinson.  Man what can I say, this video is fantastic. I believe that it has so far been underated in other reviews. Not only do u get 2 see Sugar Ray dishing out some serious damage u get to see all the greats of the times and witness mammoth battles. Any one boxer that can have 112 fights and 1 loss is pretty bloody good. In the end sugar had about 174 wins some thing like 19 loses and 120 or 140 ko's-- most of the loss's coming after the age of 40--
Just a correction-- Ali did say that 'pound for pound' sugar ray was the greatest boxer-- but in true ali fashion he boasted-- 'pound for pound I am the greatest HEAVYWEIGHT ever""
i cannot recommend this film enuf :)",986774400,3,830,4.1875
2879695,4,6304097050,"This biography has film clips of just about every Sugar Ray Robinson fight available, some extremely rare. However, most of the fights shown are of his middleweight contests.  These clips of Ray's bouts range from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Brief news-clips of Robinson accepting an award or talking to reporters are also shown. Robinson himself (circa 1979, when the documentary was made) is interviewed frequently throughout the video, although his comments are sometimes a little dull. Most interesting remark is from Muhammad Ali, who freely admits that Robinson was the best boxer who ever lived.",973468800,3,599,5.239583333333333
2879696,5,6304097050,"Director Sophia Coppolas unforgivable harsh depiction of Gen-Y is an entire 90 minutes of shallowness and extravagance. The contemporary aesthetics for cinema have generally been a shaky handheld or steadi-cam blended with hyper-editing and superfluous visual effects if called for. Yet The Bling Ring is shot in a very contrasting aesthetic  long takes, minimal set-ups, and placid shots. A summer release mind you, which made it all the more refreshing to watch in between the noisy Man of Steel; World War Z; and Pacific Rim, etc. Nevertheless, The Bling Ring is too is a noisy film, yet in momentary appropriate doses and remains a glorious exploit of fraudulence in the world of the ultra-spoiled. The teenagers obsession of celebrities and accessories is a reflection of the entire United States, not exclusively the 1%. The capitalistic hustle and the mindset of we are the center of the universe and better than everyone else remains single handedly the most popular motif throughout 2013s films (American Hustle; The East;Frances Ha; Pain & Gain; The Purge; Spring Breakers; The Wolf of Wall Street) - yet The Bling Ring says it the best. Coppolas film is so appalling that it suggests that women who are obsessed with Louis Vuitton, Vouge, TMZ, and the new perfume line by Paris Hilton are the equal of the same nerdy fan boys who dress up at Comic Con. Gen-Y can be summed up to the final scene of the film with Emma Watson, despite her crimes  she still refocuses the spotlight on her blog. Her story. Her life. Me. Me. ME.",1514419200,,1535,4.854961832061068

I suggest that everyone google 'Alexis Neiers', the girl Emma's character is based off of, and watch a few videos of her before you watch this film. Otherwise you are not giving Emma a fair chance. Her performance is absolutely flawless. I have a feeling that many of the negative reviews come from an older generation who knows absolutely nothing about the LA scene or the actual Bling Ring. If you fall into that category, do your research before watching this film. Otherwise you will be lost and misjudge the majority of the film and it's characters. Emma's character is over the top and ridiculous, yes, but that's the point. If you've never met that type of girl in person, you'll never understand.

2879721,4,6304097050,"This is a pretty basic movie, but it tells an interesting story, loosely based on an actual crime spree by  a group of teens into fashion, drugs and gossip magazines, who broke into celebritys' mansions and stole their stuff.  It does seem hard to believe that breaking into these mansions was so easy, that none had alarms or anyone else living there or paid to be there as security.  Paris for example would movie style leave a key under a doormat, but they did get into plenty of mansions in real life, so maybe the celebrities were that stupid.  Even non celebrities living in this area seemed to keep hundreds of dollars in the doors of glove boxes of their cars, why? Especially if you're not going to lock the doors.  I would think it would be a natural reflex to lock your doors when you walk away from your car.  I wonder if these teens were less stupid in what they stole (ie stuff you don't need to rely on others to get cash from), and not showing it off and bragging about it afterwards if they would have actually become quite wealthy and successful. But these teens weren't intelligent, so we have what we have here.

The Bling Ring is quite entertaining, refreshingly we actually have teen actors playing teens (Emma Watson is probably the only one you are likely to have heard of).  Some things are probably far fetched or I'd imagine they would have got caught sooner such as driving from school in a stolen BMW, not taking your school bag and stuff inside and driving off in a Porsche.  But this is a movie based on a real life crime spree after all and not a documentary.  I found the movie to be interesting and a fun enough to pass an hour and a half.

The DVD has a special feature about the making of where you learn Paris let them film in her own house and stuff like that.",1464566400,,1798,4.3373134328358205

2879802,1,6304097050,"Queued this up on Amazon Prime based on the generally favorable reviews online and out of the curiosity to see Emma Watson in something new and fun. Unfortunately there is nothing fun, new, or even entertaining about this vapid, monotonous, bore of a film. The movie revolves around a group of well-to-do teens living in Southern California who party, get drunk, go shopping, get high, and have sex. Because that's what teens do, right? But naturally, because everyone in the 13-19 age bracket acts like horny puppies with no concept of impulse control, it gets just so *boring*. So they decide to break into celebrities homes and steal stuff (clothes, guns, jewelry, and even expensive cars), play with their things, and use their money to... you guessed it: party, get drunk, go shopping, and get high. Eventually they get caught, and then the movie ends.

It's really a shame because the premise is one that has legs. Just because it's based on a true story doesn't mean you can't take liberties with it. Give us some tension, give us some interesting dialogue, give us something! There is none of that present in The Bling Ring. Instead, the scenes as they are written, show us how rich kids are terrible and that none of them have any moral quandaries in stealing things from people richer than they are. Even in writing this review, it's almost painful how interesting and (heaven forbid) entertaining this premise could have been under a different writer and director.

The right pairing could have taken this idea and brought in an antagonist to ratchet up the tension, provided some degree of roundness to the characters, or made the dialogue some level of interesting. It could be said the movie's tone reflects its players in their vapid, pointless, and conscience-free lives, but this isn't a documentary. A skilled team can show the worthlessness of the lives of their protagonists without making the movie a snoozefest. It doesn't work as a drama, crime-caper, nor action flick, and even under the banner of ""comedy"" it fails in virtually every way.

My advice? Skip The Bling Ring and maybe tidy up your yard or bedroom. Take a nap, maybe? Do a Google search for cat memes. Any of those things would be a better use of your time than to watch this film.",1443139200,5,2268,4.780612244897959

2879918,1,6304097050,"There are a couple of aspects to reviewing this movie: First, the actors and cinematography, and second, the importance and value of the story. The acting was OK - Emma Watson managed to give a reasonably good portrayal of a vacuous American teenager who's so coddled and excused by the travesty that passes for parenting that she thinks her crimes are an opportunity for publicity and launching herself as an online lifestyle guru. The other actors, similarly, played the part of the worst dregs of teendom effectively and vacuously. The cinematography was quite jagged - I'm sure Coppola intended this and it was probably meant to jar the senses of the viewer and keep your teeth on edge with a portrayal or raw idiocy and empty humanity. It certainly did that for me, but honestly I found the compulsion to turn off the 'garbage' on my screen hard to resist. The real question I found hard to answer was: Why was this movie even made, why was it even important to glorify these crass disgusting excuses for human-beings with expensive celluloid in the first place? I have no answer. The movie did not portray the individuals as they were because the actors were all bubble-gum-cute young Hollywood-darlings - come on, Emma Watson, really, what kind of casting was that? No offense Em., you're awesome, but there was no way under heaven right now you were going to be able to project the sort of sociopathic scum-sucking-bottom-dweller like the real perps were and all the movie really did was portray them as vacuous misguided teens at play. They weren't. This movie should simply never have been made. It makes light of the appalling violation of personal safety and space that burglary is, and it ignored the victims - sure, they were rich and mostly spoiled, but even rich mostly spoiled brats are terrified like the rest of us when they come home and find someone has not just broken into their space of safety, but have run-off with their stuff and probably soiled and tried-on what they left behind. These are not actions to make a glorifying or diminutizing movie out of, not like this. If I had that hour-or-so back, I wouldn't spend it watching this movie. Criminals are never as 'cute and cuddly' as these teens were made out to be, nor are they benign - there is always intimidation, aggression, and often violence, involved in the hiding of their criminal activity perpetrated on the peers and community around them. If there was any aspect of the movie which should have been played to and explored, it was the total inadequacy of the time-served-in-jail nature of the punishments. If you steal $3m worth of other people's possessions, 30-days in the county lockup is woefully inadequate a penalty to pay. The movie should have explored that, should have been outraged by that on our behalf, because the delinquents this movie would inspire will be in our homes, in our closets, in our cars, next, and then we won't think it so movie-cute after-all.",1434240000,2,2965,4.781676413255361

2879973,3,6304097050,"A few years ago, a ring of teenagers were arrested for burglarizing several Hollywood Hills homes. Many of their victims were famous celebrities. Paris Hilton was one of them. It was a story that warranted media attention and got it, but a movie? The answer is no, but here it is; a somewhat fictionalized take on the scandal, one that comes across as more of a box office cash-in than a work of art.

Sofia Coppola directs by summarizing and glamorizing. The protagonists, all or most of whom are already out of jail in real life, are stupid but trendy; annoying but cool; in a typical Californian pop-culture sort of way. When they're not burglarizing, they're sniffing coke and partying. Thats especially the case for ring leader Rebecca. The plot revolves mostly around her and her friend Marc.

2879974,1,6304097050,"I thought I'd give this movie a shot for two reasons: Emma Watson and Sophia Coppola. I have liked work that the two have done previously and felt sure that this movie would be awesome. Sure, the topic panders to the apparently unending desire of Americans for gossip about celebrities but I felt  sure that Coppola would handle this in a way that would make the audience really think.

Instead, I was shocked to find that the whole movie seemed designed to mock the audience and the real people that served as the basis of the story.  The teens and young adults that are portrayed are largely painted as people that live and die by the label and the name that can be dropped.  there are moments where I feel like we almost get a hint of something serious, points like Mark's struggles to find an identity, but largely, the young adults and older ones are portrayed with no depth and with no attempt to hide the mockery and ridicule that Coppola seems to feel for them.  Watson's performance seemed disingenuous but you can see at times that she and the other actors try for more than the superficial representation that is given.

By the end of the film, I felt like the movie was made to make me feel bad for watching it.

Maybe I missed it, but this movie (and I watched it from start to finish) didn't make me laugh and will make me extra cautious about Coppola in the future",1432512000,,1379,4.405511811023622

Alexis (played by Emma Watson) was filming a reality TV show during her arrest. The way Emma Watson portrayed Alexis Neirs is painfully accurate. She is a shallow, arrogant, spoiled girl living in Hollywood with a wacky mother who believes in pseudo science and ""homeschools"" her children. If you watch her reality TV show (Pretty Wild) on Netflix, it is a mirror image to this movie, sometimes word for word. For the other members of the ""Bling Ring"", I cannot say how accurate their characters were in the movie.

It was somewhat funny but mostly disgusting. Rich kids stealing from famous people and getting their not so rich friends in whole lot of trouble.

To movie directors: kids have an awful way of mimicking what they see on the movie screen. The scene with the girl pointing the gun around with her finger on the trigger and physical shoving was a bad idea. The whole question of ""is it loaded"" is treated like a joke. Any gun that you did not load yourself should be treated as a loaded gun, hence no finger on the trigger was bad form to show.

2880243,3,6304097050,"First of all, this film is gorgeous to look at - even the thieves look like baby supermodels, which probably accounts for some of the hate this film has received.  After all, why should we feel sorry for a bunch of fairly well-off thieves who decide to rob the homes of the rich and famous?  These spoiled, Facebook and Twitter-happy Millennials should be grateful they're not digging ditches!

If you watched the documentary that accompanies the dvd, you'd discover that all of these kids come from very dysfunctional homes. The fact that Sofia Coppola neglected to shed any light on their family histories is a shame, because that explanation would have helped the viewer understand better how they gave in to mindless greed.  All of them were unhappy and depressed despite (outwardly) privileged lives, and stole stuff to cheer themselves up.  It's not just celebrity-worship that made them do it, which Coppola short-sightedly focuses on.  As the daughter of Hollywood royalty, she naively thinks that celebrities have the kind of life which anyone would want, and easily got the cooperation of vain, narcissistic blondes like Paris Hilton and Kristen Dunst to appear briefly in the film.  That these kids would ""steal from the best"" seems to imply that they're giving these airheads the ultimate compliment.  Sadly, Coppola fails to realize, like the kids, that their kleptomania is driven by emotional deprivation, similar to the way Marie Antoniette shopped til she dropped because she suffered from serious depression.

I loathed Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" because of the appalling way she depicted the Japanese people.  Here, I was at first amazed that the lead character is a gorgeous Asian-American.  Good, I thought, she's mended her ways of indulging in ignorant ethnic stereotyping. That was before I realized that the actress, Chang, was portrayed as the ringleader and thief.

The teens find out when a celebrity will be away from home, break in (so easily), make themselves at home, smoke, drink, take selfies, load up their tote bags and leave. Then they do it again, and again...you get the point. The movie never goes beyond the superficial, the characters never get beyond one-dimensional.

What makes the movie truly unbearable is the pacing and the use of the locations. Coppola could have done something incredible with the access she was given to these lavish estates, but the shots are rather uninspired and basic. The lack of creativity could be overlooked if the shot actually managed to bring you into the space and bring the story to life, but overall the scenes fall flat. The low amount of coverage aside, the tempo and editing of this movie kills any bit of intrigue the raw film once possessed. As I watched I found myself mentally editing and paring down the media to kill time between cuts. The editor either fell too in love with certain shots or had limited usable footage because many of the scenes drag (especially in the actual trespassing scenes.) The meaningful and useful shots could probably be condensed down to about  half an hour from the movie's actual 90 minute run time. I could also address the poor sound mixing, annoying media montages, and ineffective use of a non-linear format, but I really don't care enough to elaborate on those shortcomings...",1412035200,,1200,4.769230769230769

However, it goes too far into not casting judgement, letting the viewer believe that the conspirators were in some sense victims themselves, rather than decidedly amoral.
In all, it feels like this somewhat dry, drawn-out film does little to influence the kind of culture it is trying to depict, and may or may not be successful in de-glamourising it. Enough said.
One wonders if Sofia Coppola's upbringing did little to extend her outside of the bounds of hollywood shallowness, and whether 'Lost in Translation' is her only exercise into the semi-autobiographical unknown.",1410566400,,757,5.162601626016261

2880284,4,6304097050,"This movie is excellent in its portrayal of the amoral crimes committed by a group of celebrity- and fashion-obsessed teenagers. Sofia Coppola made the home environments of the thieves bland, with the scenes of their partying and stealing and playing dress-up colorful, showing the allure and excitement these crimes provided the criminals. There is no character development in the film, but that's to be expected. This film is based on actual events in a brief time in teenagers' lives. The film unfortunately does glamorize what these thieves did. I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on the consequences of their actions: family visiting them in jail, what it was like in prison, the difficulty of living with their criminal convictions once they were released. One of the crime victims, Paris Hilton, appears in a DVD extra, talking about the impact of the crimes on her: the fear, the loss of her sense of security in her own home, the wondering whether a friend or other insider might have done it, the violation and invasion of her privacy, the sickness of seeing strangers in her home in surveillance video. It was moving to hear her describe the sadness of losing jewelry that had been in her family a hundred years, that her grandma used to wear, and had been passed down to her. That footage should have been in the film itself. For everyone thinking, ""Big deal, these celebrities are rich, so what if they lose some of their stuff, they can get more,"" seeing Paris Hilton explain the effects of these crimes on her, shows that each of the crime victims is a human being, with the same feelings any of us have. My heart really went out to her, and the other crime victims. The film should have devoted time to the feelings of the people who were robbed, as well as the realities of imprisonment on the criminals. So little time is given to that, the film makes it seem like these kids had a glamorous crime spree, with a slap on the wrist at the end of it.",1410393600,,1976,4.600566572237961

This would be fine if the movie was entertaining. If there was a hint of a story, or structure, or even engaging characters, but you get none of that here. What you are instead treated to is a horrifically boring ""slice of life"" kind of movie with absolutely no direction, as annoyingly episodic as possible, and as stated before, starring some other actress and actor as the main characters.

The film is chock full of pointless montage scenes, cringe inducing dialogue, and horribly vapid performances from most of the cast. Emma did fine with what little she was given to work with, and does speak in a very convincing ""valley girl"" American accent. She of course looks beautiful as well.

Some have defended this movie stating the point was to create this materialistic empty feeling by foregoing anything resembling a plot or a story, or fleshed out characters, but it simply does not work. All that results is a boring mess. I saw this for free and I feel I should have been paid to see it.",1407888000,,1180,4.609523809523809

This can sometimes leave you feeling like what did I just watch or what did I just watch this for.  Some reviews commented that the characters had no depth nor did we watch anything more than a bunch of teenagers stealing.  I think that might have been the point.  These teenagers were not deep they were shallow and self centered, much like most of us in our teens.

We don't know anything about the characters as actual people, their pasts, their home lives, etc. The most we get is a glimpse at the mom who teaches her daughter about the Secret. Everything else is them partying, doing drugs, stealing, and obsessing about materialism and celebrities. Then they get caught and serve a miniscule sentence.

This movie is not a movie I would watch with a bunch of friends since it tends to be a slower movie, but I would watch it, especially if you a Emma Watson fan. Yes a lot of the movie tends to be teens doing drugs, robbing houses or just making bad choices, it really makes you think about really what it is like to have all that fame and money.

They went to Paris Hilton's house like five times, Which happened in the real life events but I don't want to watch people go in and out of Paris Hilton's house five times. I skipped over the last 45 minutes because it was just watching kids think they are awesome for listening to Kayne West and doing drugs. And I'm not sure if the point of the movie was to show how glamorous that was or to show how stupid that was. Either one is stupid.
It only gets a star at all because Emma Watson's accent magically disappeared and she and many of the other actors did a really good job at acting like total bitches. So, good acting.",1400198400,,1004,4.4324324324324325
2880428,3,6304097050,"I get where Sofia Coppola was going with this.  I do.  I just have to wonder if she's really the person to be giving us this message, surrounded as she is and has always been by wealth and fame.  It feels disingenuous to sit through an hour and a half long lecture about the evils of greed layered subtly with reminders that the famous are people too--it's not a message that we poor, unfamous wannabes particularly need to hear, and if we do, we don't want to hear it from the daughter of American Cinema.

That said, I do appreciate the subtlety of the message, and I don't agree with reviews that said this was poorly acted at all.  It's very nuanced and layered, and I really didn't see any characters who didn't feel multifaceted and in-depth to me.  There was something exquisitely awful about Emma and Taissa's characters, though really any of the characters was terrible in a fascinating way.

I wish it had been framed a little bit differently--I got the impression that I was supposed to feel sorry for someone in this movie, but I couldn't figure out who, exactly, deserved sympathy or pity when each of them got exactly what they wanted: to be cool, to meet their idols, to (literally) steal from their fashion icons, to have their fifteen minutes of fame--and there were a lot of times I noted a shot being used not because it was impactful or because it led the story but because it looked good on film (the scene at Audrina's house, the interminably long scene in the dark car lit by nothing but the dash before an awkward, truncated attempt at conversation, the repetitiveness of the dancing/party scenes only noticeably different because the lights in the background had changed).  The director does a great job when understanding the way things look on camera, but this one felt lackluster and feeble, pretty shots and scenes used in ways that made the film feel more flip than usual for a Sofia Coppola film--Virgin Suicides, this was not; where usually every frame feels important, even when she's telling the by-now-familiar-from-her parable about excess through dizzy shots of clothes and shoes, The Bling Ring lacks even the substance to make it a satisfying film.

The Movie was hard to watch after awhile and I was ready for it to end. It may be that I am a little older than Her target audience but I think good films do not have that problem. I think the real group of Kids who committed these crimes do owe her a little thanks because the Actors portraying them were much better looking.

SPOILERs AHEAD: She could have done so much with the Rebecca character, but nothing!. Coppola did absolutely no research of her own it seems and apparently she did not go beyond the confines of the Vanity Fair magazine on which this movie is based. Come on!, she even included the bit at the end where the reporter is interviewing them. I do not care about the reporter. Why should I?

This film oddly reminds me of the obverse of A Clockwork Orange. This is also a film about a gang, about the obsession with glamour, and the sense that the future may have nothing to offer.

This film is based on the true story of a group of teens in Los Angeles who -- compelled by the desire to have the things their heroes (Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Rachel Bilson, and others) have, to wear the clothes they wear, to live in their homes -- set out and burgle these celebrity super-stars' homes.

How could this really have happened?  How could a group of bored kids have, for instance, broken into Paris Hilton's house multiple times?  How could they have gotten away with it for so long?

Well, Sofia Coppola sets out to answer some of these questions.  But more importantly, she answers the larger questions about how a society produced these needs in this group of high school in the first place.  The internet, 25 hour celebrity news cycle made up of shows like TMZ, and the ability for kids with empty lives to find even more empty goals for which to strive.  All of this and more is addressed by ""The Bling Ring.""

What Coppola does so well here is what she always does so well: Create an atmosphere, fill it with characters who represent some discreet elements of their society, and layer it with mood.

The entirety of the film is stupid kids making stupid decisions, to a soundtrack of stupid music, and they don't seem to learn anything in the end.

Towards the end, when they get caught, the story changes, but it is so short that the ""pay-off"" is not there. If you do watch the movie, watch one sequence, of what I described above and then fast forward to the end. That's pretty much the movie. No insight. The movie doesn't offer to tell us what happened, if anything, to them after prison and then it endorses the dumbest one of the groups, by letting her tell her side of the story, on other words, a lie and then letting her promote herself by letting her announce her website.

This was a 30 minute expose turned into a 82 minute movie (The credits account for 8 minutes of the total running time!)... I couldn't tell if Director/Writer Coppola was intentionally leaving these characters as cardboard cut-outs or was portraying these kids as she did to reveal them as the shallow, morally bankrupt brats of the well-to-do that they apparently were... One thing though is that if the crimes were committed as they were enacted in the film I would have little problem putting all these kids on probation (And jailed their parents)... Totally non-violent acts against wealthy celebrities who have so much stuff and yet lack the wherewithal to lock their homes or turn their alarms on? I mean they robbed Paris Hilton 8 times? She should have thanked them for thinning out her stuff... And is Audrina a real person? #smh

In fact, it shows them go to the same house 3 times. We get it, Paris Hilton has a lot of really nice designer clothes (why wouldn't she? She's a heiress/runway model).

There's virtually no character development, hardly a plot, and not much by way of dialogue. I expected so much more from this movie and it was just really... meh. At no point did I feel any emotion for the characters beyond ""These kids are kinda dumb"". So kudos to the actors for accurately describing 16 year olds (which, by the way, I had to google the true story to find out how old they are because at no point are we given info that would let you know their age beyond the fact that they appear to be enrolled in HS).

There's honestly too much to complain about in this movie and little to praise. I saw one review say that the film was well shot... who cares? A well shot but boring movie is like trying to sell a rust covered car as ""Dent free!"" You're kind of solving the wrong problem. If you have a spare 90 minutes, go ahead and watch it for yourself.

I felt like they were trying to tell some of the personal stories of the kids involved, but the ""exciting part"" of the movie was having the ring break into all the houses, so they spent way too much time on that and not enough time on the ""back story"" of the personal lives and what led them to where ended up..  At the very end of the movie, it ends in such a way that I think you're supposed to have some feeling about Emma Watson's character and the way she's using this negative experience in her life, but (and maybe this is just me) but the little glimpses of her personal life throughout the movie didn't set it up well enough.  I think we saw a little too much of the drug use and the partying (it was abundantly clear that the kids were using drugs prolifically) and some of that screen time could have been put to much better use I think..  The whole car accident thing while under the influence just sort of happened in the blink of the eye and then was over with no real explanation of what the point was..  I don't know, just seemed weird overall - if you want to tell a personal story, then do it, if you just want action action action, that's fine too, but do it..

I will explain. I lived in the place where the movie is set, Calabasas, from the age of three until I was twenty-one. I went to the same school as the characters/culprits, and frequented the same areas... and let me tell you, most of the teens/young adults in this area are exactly that: boring, vain, underdeveloped, vapid, and shallow. Most of these teens have spent the duration of their lives in the comfort of what we liked to call it, ""The Bubble,"" with an obscene amount of privilege and zero adversity. So, the portrayal of the characters is actually an interesting commentary of the effects of affluence on teens.

If you have a particular aversion or distaste for this breed of human, then this movie is likely not your type. However, if you find the consequences of money upon adolescent development (or lack thereof) appealing, then you will find this movie to be an amusing commentary on that. I think many people considered this a drama, or action flick... when it is simply a comedy.

Had the characters been more developed the movie would have lacked veracity and rung hollow. I mean, what do you really expect from a group of over-privileged, vapid dropouts anyways?",1392854400,184,1382,4.7740585774058575

On a certain level, you shouldn't like it, because it strikes a chord in your soul which points to an appalling truth about our culture and the environment in which American children are raised.
If you want to actually enjoy the film as much as I did, you must realize that you are watching the work of a master filmmaker, and try to take the film as more than just a simple narrative about some idiot kids.

They are at a 'bad kid' school and that's what gives them the feeling to just be bad I guess. It is silly and boring. If there was a better story line it would be awesome.

The film is fine.  In Coppola's signature laid-back, naturalistic, non-judgmental camera, the girls seem less like hard criminals than bored future Housewives of LA.  They want to have the best stuff and they want it now.  They want to be sexy and popular and envied.  They're shallow and vapid, but Coppola doesn't spell it out for you like a Drop Dead Gorgeous.

The film is about a group of bored, well off teens obsessed with celebrity culture who turn to breaking and entering to satisfy their boredom and desire for luxury. The common sense factor is missing(I found myself constantly asking, who was dumber, the teens for nonchalantly thinking nothing would happen to them, or the celebrities that left their doors open to them.).The acting is kind of give or take, however kudos to the young actors really nailing the personalities and mannerisms of their real life counterparts. Most in particular, Leslie Mann, Emma Watson and Taisa Farmiga, who are scarily accurate as 'Laurie', 'Nikki' and 'Sam'(Andrea Arlington-Dunn, Alexis Neiers and Tess Taylor-compare to the one shot E! reality show, ""Pretty Wild""). The Key star in this film though is luxe atmosphere, the excess and richness of the costumes and sets, and the L.A. nightlife that was super popular at the time the film takes place, that contrasts to the washed out, seemingly monotone daytime of the characters everyday lives.

It would have been much more engaging is she'd included the parallel investigation of the crimes.  Including how long it took to gain police attention and how it proceeded to their ultimate capture would have been good counterpoint and given the story some weight.  On the plus side the actors did justice to their portrayals of the tawdry sub-culture that lacks even the shadow of a moral compass.

2880873,4,6304097050,"I first watched this film on a flight from Dallas to London. While I wasn't sold on the concept (making a film about the real teens who robbed celebrity's homes), I love Emma Watson, and I am generally a fan of Sofia Coppola's work, so I decided to give it a shot.

I was pleasantly surprised by the style of the film. The dialogue wasn't polished or smooth, and I could tell (especially with Nicki and the scenes with her family) that Coppola was going for an improvised, natural feel based on how these real people actually talked to one another. Have you seen PRETTY WILD, the show that features the real girl affiliated with ""the bling ring,"" Alexis Neiers? THE BLING RING replicates complete scenes from the show in the scenes with Nicki's family, which was simultaneously unsettling and refreshing.

Another strength of the film was its use of popular music. Songs like ""Bad Girls"" by M.I.A. layer the events as they unfold, and the juxtaposition of gangsta rap with these young, affluent, Calabasas teens just adds to the mystery of their characters.

There is a lot more I could say about this film, but I'll leave you with this: if you don't like the work of Sofia Coppola, if you are ""frustrated with today's youth,"" if you only want to see Emma Watson, this movie isn't for you.

I'm not going to go into a deeply critical rant about this film, because either you got it or you didn't, just like Marie Antoinette, or Lost in Translation. I had expected a lot, and it delivered. It was a crime film, that mostly took place at night in classic noir style. The number of heists and the loot taken was epic! There were some beautiful cars, but no car chases. Only one shot got fired, but that was one of the best and most unique scenes with a gun I have ever seen in a movie. There was a dragon lady femme fatale, but nobody got croaked because of her, and contrary to classic noir, HE brought her down. And not a drop of blood, just lots of makeup. I dare anyone to compare this film to something else.",1390521600,,835,4.097560975609756
2880977,2,6304097050,"Coppola's made an interesting sort of film, whether intentionally or not --there's really no protagonist here, no one to really root for.  Of course the kids in the Bling Ring were the real wrongdoers, burglarizing celebs and indulging in substance abuse, but in a weird ironic way, they were imitating the same reckless vices that some (not all) of the celeb victims were indulging in themselves.  Take Lohan for example, with all the legal struggles and substance abuse issues.  Strangely enough, one of the Bling Ring burglars ends up as Lohan's cellmate, in an interesting twist of fate.

There is some rudimentary attempt at making Marc (the only male in the Bling Ring) the storyteller/protagonist, but it fails miserably...is he an outcast just trying to fit in? Perhaps, at first.  But, like Lohan's character in the film 'Mean Girls', what starts as an attempt to fit in becomes something else entirely, as he wholly assimilates into the Bling Ring, including appropriating their value system, or lack thereof.

The one thing about this film that was impressive was Emma Watson's take on the Valley Girl accent, which, if I hadn't known she was British, I'd never have guessed.  She really brilliantly copies her real life counterpart's mannerisms and cavalier attitude towards the crimes, including her vapid, blank-eyed gaze.

The film doesn't glamorize the crimes, at least in the end, and it shouldn't...Coppola wisely changed the names of the criminals in the film, as if to detract from their personas and focus on their actions.  Ultimately though, this film is more of a cautionary tale than anything entertaining, a ""don't let your kids end up like this"" sort of movie. Some of the most telling scenes are the few that show the interactions between the parents and their burglarizing children, one of an aloof obliviousness.

Why the two stars, after this long review? I guess I'm torn on giving it anything more.  The story is very weakly interesting at best, and I really wonder if we need to give these people any more attention or airtime--because clearly, judging by their interviews and court appearances, the attention is a big part of what they wanted.

Ultimately, it's basically a feature-length, depressing look at how 'our' (The Millenial) generation is viewed...all I can say to those older generations watching us grow up, is please don't give up on us! We're not all crazed, fame-obsessed, emotionally vacant walking selfies like the kids in this film.",1390521600,,2485,5.034146341463415

2880982,2,6304097050,"If the goal of the film is to deglamoriz crime, it succeeded.  The problem is that cinematography and acting by the cast is to good.  It feels to real to work as entertainment that inspires repeat viewings.  Watching the selfish teens brake into people's homes is doubly voyeuristic.  It has not only the feel of violating the celebritie's personal space and property, but also spying on teanagers.  Especialy since this is based on a true story.

I'm all in favor of not glamorizing and making celebrities out of real life criminals.  In this case the damage was already done and the members of the Bling Ring already achieved celebrity status.  The best that the victims could hope for is that the inevitable movie that would be made of the events would discourage other kids from attempting similar crimes.  The film works in that respect, but ultimately makes it unentertaing to watch.

The only thing that I could say that I ""loved"" about the movie was Ms. Watson's portrayal of Alexis Neiers (the real person her character is based on.) She nailed her mannerisms quite well.

2880989,4,6304097050,"There are two actual issues at stake here: whether or not the movie seems vapid (it does), and whether or not this is entertaining (up to you).

But the vapidness is on purpose; the affected-seeming speech and Cali girl talk come off as true. There is no big redemption and there is no subplot, but why should there be? That isn't what this movie is about because, it could be argued, that isn't what this story is about. The bling ring was a group of teenagers who did some crazy stupid and very immoral things. To say there needs to be more depth to them seems inappropriate, and not true to the story. It's even lampshaded in the movie when the girls' mother tries to talk to them about valuable characteristics of Angelina Jolie, and they name ""her husband"" and ""her hot bod."" The mom's distress is clear. By the end of the movie, yours might be too, as you're caught between the glitz and how strange the whole thing feels. It's also strange because several celebrities, most notably Paris Hilton (who was robbed by the ring), appeared in the film, as did her house. She has a nightclub in her house, and as the ring breaks in to party there, you feel disconnected from the whole thing (unless you're rich and also have your own private nightclub, in which case you might relate). The decadence of everything is heady.

This is decidedly a Sofia Coppola movie. It looks and sounds and feels like it. So if you don't like her other works, you probably won't like this one either. I liked it and I'm glad I saw it but I'm not sure I'd watch it again.",1390435200,,1553,4.407665505226481
2880990,1,6304097050,Not a very good story. Basically a bunch of spoiled kids without back stories. I would not recommend this movie.,1390435200,,112,4.65
2880991,1,6304097050,"First let me note that I almost never leave negative reviews. See my profile.

After watching the film, I couldn't resist going to Rotten Tomatoes to see which critics liked this movie.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are a quite a few.  Anyway, when I see their reviews in the future, I can be fairly certain they are idiots or shills, or want badly to be friends with the Coppolas.

Since there's very little in the way of surprise or revelation, I won't worry about spoiling anything here.  You see some vapid, materialistic kids 1) pick a celebrity, 2) look up her address and travel plans on Google, and 3) go rob her house, all while delivering snappy lines like, ""Awesome,"" ""Wow,"" and ""Oh my god, you guys.""  And then you see that sequence again.  And again.

If at the one-hour mark you feel like you've watched the same bad short film eight times, you can at least credit Ms. Coppola for fitting what feels like two hours of repetition into a runtime merely half that. That leaves another thirty minutes to watch a new short film about the police showing up at a kid's door.  You'll treasure that one the fifth time around.

I puzzle especially at the critics who praise the visual artistry.  The film looks like a competent micro-budget DSLR shoot.  If you're in film school, that's something to be proud of.  But if you imagine what Paul Thomas Anderson or Darren Aronofsky might do with the same material, and still you want to write about ""wonderful cinematography"" or ""beautifully shot"",  you're embarrassing yourself.

Finally, I fail to see how this can be construed as commentary on the celebrity/TMZ culture. It is a literal, minimally artistic retelling of factual events involving celebrities.  This movie is TMZ.  And if you love one, you'll probably love the other.",1390435200,,1786,4.765472312703583

Most of the movie is a voyeuristic retelling of the activities of a notorious group as they help themselves to the closets of the rich and famous. There is almost an hour of slowly escalating selfishness and self destructive behavior. The movie assumes the viewer has seen the news, so it does not spoil the film to reveal that two thirds of the way through their fun is cut short as their indulgences catch up with them. The characters are so misguided and self centered that even when caught only the male of the group shows any remorse at all. Even his remorse seemed to be about getting caught not the shameful nature of his conduct. I was actually relieved when they were discovered since the movie had began to drag as their crimes became repetitive. Once they are caught the film only has left to reveal that the parents seem as clueless and disconnected from any ability to empathize with the victims as their imprudent teenaged children. If the performances of the cast were not as outstanding as they are this movie would have been downright painful at its slow pace with such unappealing characters.

I found pretty much everyone in the movie, aside from the mother, to be very wooden and boring. I think at times the actresses were annoyed with having to play such ridiculous characters, especially given that this is based on a true story. In a nut shell, it is a story about a group of celebrity- obsessed teenagers who decide to become an organized band of criminals, stealing from the celebrities that they essentially stalk the internet for news. The fact that this is a true story is almost hard to conceive. How dumb does a person have to be to leave their million dollar mansion unlocked? I understand Paris Hilton is not exactly a brain surgeon, but come on! She was basically opening the door and welcoming the little criminals into her home. I honestly don't know who is more dumb, the vapid teenagers or the clueless "" celebrities."" If you want to watch a movie about narcissistic teenagers turned criminals, then this is the movie for you. The plot moves agonizingly slow, providing absolutely no climax or honestly any excitement whatsoever. Emma Watson is a much better actress than this movie portrayed her to be.

I was looking for the real story some explanation, insight or at least a statement that shed light on these lost ones of their generation who worship celebrity and stuff more than their own well being. I thought perhaps it would show the addiction to heroin, cocaine and alcohol that fueled some of their plights and what that really looks like. Unfortunately what I watched was a recap superficial and insensitive. The cinematography was beautiful but a little choppy. Emma Watson stood out but was not convincing. Leslie Mann's performance was dead on the character from the reality show but even the reality show portrayed a very superficial story with no insight except what could not be glossed over. (the utter adolescent view of superficial reality)  It was difficult to remember who was who. The reality show Pretty Wild was more compelling and true than this movie. There was a pathetic lost immature quality that the film did not even attempt.
These kids were on the outside and like many adolescents believed if they had the right stuff it was their ticket to utter coolness.
This movie was not satirical it was superficial
It was not funny but confusing
They used exact moments from the reality show but they did not slap you in the face just seemed stupid. The absurdity of the reality was not used and was the very basis for any satire.
No one was a real whole complex human but instead superficial bad kids with no lasting memorable characteristics beyond the stereotypes. Coppola was out of her realm, she has never been anything but an insider and was not able to conjure sensitivity beyond stereotypes of the characters OR even those they took from. She told a story that had no depth or understanding one that could be gathered from the pages of TMZ and be more interesting. There is so much more that could of have been done with this story. It could have gone the superficial route and been fun and voyeuristic and like a party you were guiltily partaking in but it was not.

The entire movie could have been a 30 second public service announcement done by your local police station and would have featured better acting.

They do tons of drugs and yet somehow none of the terrible affects of drug abuse come into play. And the one saving grace you're waiting for, when they get caught and have to deal with their consequences? That is the last 3 minutes of the movie tops. In a 90 minute movie, you get less than three minutes of actual ""acting"" instead of partying and giggling while stealing. Three minutes of sincerity, a few lines of dialog, and then CREDITS. Que the wall of applause from people who think they know an artistic movie when they see one.

This movie is less than 5% of what Requiem for a Dream already did thirteen years ago. Watch that movie and you'll know what rock bottom, and getting mixed up with the wrong people can actually look like. And how truly black, and dark the world can get with the wrong choices. And guess what? Requiem for a Dream was done on half the budget and still manages much more realistic cinematography imbued with the emotional plot line.

You feel that movie. You feel like you're watching a close friend slowly die. This movie feels like watching a bunch of kids you hate party and steal and have almost nothing bad happen to them.

2881048,4,6304097050,"Had this been a film by anyone other than Sofia Coppola it might be another 3 1/2 star piece relegated to the dustbin of indie films that were good but not great (and there are a lot of those). The film easily opens itself to Marxist, Feminist, and, naturally, Red Feminist readings. It seems to speak at once to our fascination with wealth, fame, and how we identify people with things external or separate from themselves (i.e. their patterns of consumption, their possessions, their bodies, the list goes on). Through this lens we may understand the films brief flirtations with cross dressing to have, perhaps, a deeper meaning. These are not necessarily mere layers to a character, but allusions to cultural conditions.

The cinematography is beautiful and inventive, though does seem to alternate between subtly enhancing the story and various elements within it, and calling attention to itself. This is not to say that either is poorly executed, but the film does obtain an odd rhythm from these decisions. Despite that it is one of the few films in recent memory that has, in my mind, successfully integrated the elements of the digital age.

It is almost more compelling  watching this on a laptop and seeing facebook posts and watching  the TMZ logo flash across the screen as though one had clicked a video on their site and it had just loaded.

Coppola, I think, is held back by her emphasis on a documentary approach. Emma Watson delivers the best performance, though that's not to say the others aren't doing a good job, rather her character obtains a greater depth because we see more of her interactions with other characters. Also, there is an interesting set of conclusions that can be reached by questions just whose voice we hear calling the police.

Coppola inherently nails the atmosphere of a culture, most accurately in the nostalgic venture to Japan in Lost in Translation.  Parallel, to miss her bullseye accuracy in this microcosm of degenerate celebrity culture that fails vulnerable, insecure, and ungrounded adolescence teens is a true mistake.

The so-called ""famous for being famous"" crowd that includes the likes of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan.

These teenagers literally broke into the homes of notable celebrities who lived in their area and stole lots of money and other valuable objects or ""things"" which they used to try and emulate the lavish, hedonistic lifestyles of the very stars they stole from. It says a lot about our modern society and how people tend to look up to and admire the most shallow, unlikable, idiotic, and overall meritless individuals simply because they are famous.

2881069,4,6304097050,"Nine Things about The Bling Ring

1. Directed by Sofia Coppola, this is based on a true story that made the news in 2009 (note: This is not the TV movie by the same name).

2. Its about a group of disaffected, self-absorbed, privileged kids that rob celebrities houses while they are gone.

3. This is a stylish, hip black comedy that was better than I expected. As the kids capers escalate, so does the visual style of the film.

4. Paris Hilton was robbed by them multiple times in real life, and she makes a cameo in the film. Parts of the movie were filmed in her house - which is beyond description.

5. Emma Watson gives a great performance as a bitchy, drugged-out brat. She has definitely left Hogwarts behind.

6. This movie is basically about rich people robbing richer people, so its really hard to feel sorry for anybody.

7. Coppola doesnt really take a stand on the morality of what happened. She kind of lets the kids give their own interpretation of what they did. This is an interesting choice, but she also loses the opportunity to really dig into the deeper issues, which is kind of disappointing.

8. You still can pull a few lessons from it, such as the eternal truth that kids are always looking for acceptance, no matter how much money their parents make. Cool is relative.

9. In the end, this is a testament to conspicuous consumption, and the idea that no matter how much you have, its never enough.",1388361600,,1425,4.471042471042471

2881079,3,6304097050,"Sofia Coppolas latest effort The Bling Ring is about a recent real-life criminal case known as the Bling Ring, a series of celebrity burglaries carried out by teenagers 2008 to 2009 around Calabasas, California. The victims include Paris Hilton (who allows the director to film inside her house, and also briefly appears as herself), Audrina Patridge, Rachel Bilson, Orlando Bloom and Lindsay Lohan. The film is based on Nancy Jo Sales's Vanity Fair article, later extended to a book The Bling Ring: How a Gang of Fame-Obsessed Teens Ripped Off Hollywood and Shocked the World.

OK, so how did they do it? Sofia Coppolas film certainly shows that to you, but not in a very interesting way. Those teenagers including Rebecca (Katie Chang), Mark (Israel Broussard) and Nicki (Emma Watson) unlawfully enter the house through the doors left unlocked, steal clothes and other stuff, and go back to their home. The film follows the aimless kids activities too literally, getting repetitious while making no point whatsoever.

And perhaps that is exactly the point of The Bling Ring, a superficial and emotionally distant film about superficial and one-dimensional characters we really don't care. One may argue that the film only intends to reflect the culture where it is made, but do we really need to spend 90 minutes of our life to learn the obvious thing?

Not that the film has no merit. The moody photography of late Harris Savides is effective and as in The Perks of Being a Wallflower Emma Watson shows her brilliant acting skills.

I've read reviews that state that watching the movie is like watching an extended music video and they aren't wrong, the movie's soundtrack is superb and not at all resigned to the background. But the use of music in the film is just one of the many genius ways Coppola uses traditional filmmaking techniques in an unorthodox way. The acting by all five of the stars is spot on which many criticize by being flat and lifeless, which is exactly the angle Coppola wanted.

That means you get the parties, the crime, the drugs, everything the movie's characters refer to as ""the lifestyle."" All this, especially the thievery, serves to create a driving tension that was purposefully eschewed in Coppola's previous movie Somewhere. The result is a more immediately entertaining movie.

2881105,3,6304097050,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Every moviegoer undoubtedly has their own set of performers they would see in anything. The movie itself can be panned by critics and audiences alike, but that won't stop them from watching it anyway. Although I don't have many, Emma Watson definitely makes my list, and as a result I had to sit through 90 minutes of The Bling Ring. I knew going in that this probably wasn't going to resonate with me in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Watson was in it, and that was really all the motivation I needed to sit down and watch it. As a film, The Bling Ring attempts to portray a message of idolization, but the content is so shallow that its hard to take it too seriously.

Based on real events, The Bling Ring attempts to tell the story of the infamous(?) Bling Ring, a group of young adults who went around robbing the homes of celebrities. What starts as a somewhat innocent escapade quickly turns into an obsession as the audience gets to watch these teenagers rob house, after house, after house. Although the movie centers on this ensemble cast, most of the focus seems to be put on Marc Hall (Israel Broussard), a quiet teen who suffers from social anxietyhes also the only character I actually liked, to some extent. Unfortunately, things spiral out of control when the ringleader Rebecca Ahn (Katie Chang) finds herself addicted to the rush, and the cold hand of karma slaps the group in the face.

What bothered me most about this film is that there seemed to be a strong lack of direction and genuine motivation. From start to finish, The Bling Ring is a chaotic blur of drugs, alcohol, partying, and robbing, which left me feeling empty and disengaged. To make matters worse, while it manages to tell its story well enough, the narrative thats weaved through these 90 minutes isn't terribly interesting. Once I was 15 minutes into the movie I found that I didn't care about these characters or their story, after 45 minutes I still didn't care, and by the end of it my indifference hadnt changed. Once the credits began to roll I began to feel physically ill as I remembered that this is based off something that happened, and that these were real people. Its disgusting.

In addition, there is little-to-no character development to be found here, as these self-entitled brats clearly don't care about anyone, or anything, but themselves. As I said before, the only person I genuinely cared about was Marc, and thats only because he was only doing this out of some misguided obligation. Hes insecure about himself and his abilities, which is why he finds himself so obligated to go along with Rebecca because he finally has someone who gives him some attentionhes also the only one who shows any kind of humane qualities while robbing these people. You could always tell that he really didn't want to be part of their shenanigans, and he genuinely seemed bothered by their actions.

Where this film truly shines, though, is in its cast. While The Bling Ring may not have the most interesting story, the cast portraying these individuals did a phenomenal job of exemplifying the worst of our youth. Chang and Broussard both gave convincing performances, and Chang showed a lot of potential as an actress. In addition, Watson performed wonderfully as Nicki Moore. Although I don't totally agree with the high praise shes been given for this role, theres no denying that she played the stuck-up, spoiled character really well. Another standout was Claire Julien, who plays Chloe Tainer. This is another up-and-comer who showed a lot of promise with her performance, and hopefully she starts getting offered more roles in the future.

Finally, although I personally hated every piece of music used in the film, The Bling Ring's soundtrack does an exceptional job of portraying the fun, care-free attitude of these teens. It's loud, obnoxious, and upbeat, which sets the perfect tone for the scenes and situations present in the movie. Consisting of music from Rick Ross, Kanye West, M.I.A., and Azealia Banks, this soundtrack is only going to appeal to a select group of individuals. However, ignoring its contribution to the film would be a disservice to those who worked on putting it together. The music doesn't have to be mind-blowing to be considered a good soundtrack, it just has to fit within the context of the story, and The Bling Ring more than accomplishes this task.

Overall Score: 5/10 - Although The Bling Ring attempts to showcase a message about societys obsession with celebrities, it never fully executes the task. Instead, it settles on a mediocre story about a group of very unlikable teens, and the film suffers greatly because of it. All it really accomplished was bringing more attention to this group when their 15 minutes of fame should have been over long ago. In the end, the only redeemable quality would be the performances from the cast, but other than that I cant say this is something I would watch again. However, if you're curious about it I would suggest a rental, but you shouldnt go out of your way to see it.",1385337600,,5106,4.775764439411098

I watched it again with that in mind, and it definitely added to the story. I would recommend this movie.

2881109,5,6304097050,"The Bling Ring by Nancy Jo Sales is one of the best books I have ever read. It opened my eyes about how corrupt some of todays youth really are and the out of control envy some people have for todays ""rich and famous"". It's filled with drama, suspense and the crazy ability that these kids had to deceive people so well and for so long.
The cool thing about this book is that it is 100% a true story. There were so many times I found myself saying ""No way!"" but all of the things that happened in this book happened in real life a few years ago. It's about a group of teenagers, later known as ""The Bling Ring"", that went around robbing celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Audrina Partridge, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox and plotted to rob many many more. Rachel and Nick, known as the ""Ring Leaders"", initially started this fad these teenagers had. They later got friends to join them. They stole millions of dollars worth of items such as purses, shoes, watches and tons more. These fame, young hollywood obsessed, materialistic, ""rich"" kids wanted it all and were going at all costs to get it. Some of the things the kids did were sickening and quiet scary... such as steeling Megan Fox's hand gun and playing around with it and steeling money to buy cocaine which led to addiction for some of the kids. But while this story has serious topics there are some twists that cause you to laugh. Such as when Nick and the kids go to Paris Hiltons house and try on her shoes... You find out that Paris Hilton wears a size 11 shoe! And because of this, Nick steals these pink pumps and wears them around, its corrupt but funny at the same time.
I just overall loved this book for how real it was... but for how unreal and unbelievable it was at the same time. This book isn't laid out in a typical ""story"" format like most of us are used to. It is written from Nancy, the author's, prospective and point of few and it is the facts about what happened while her opinions are also stated and included. It's all about her interviews and encounters with the kids, the research, and the things Nancy went through in order to help make this true story into a movie (which I recommend watching).
I would suggest this book to mature teenagers and women of all ages or even men that are interested in a hollywood, fame obsessed themed book. It is a great, entertaining read with a great unintentional message. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars! Read it!",1384732800,,2444,4.3618421052631575

2881113,3,6304097050,"Like one of the reviewers  here describe, pointless. You can feel the undertone of this whole affair. These people's lives including the parents; pointless. Their lives are pointless. Especially the pretence of spiritual enlightenment. An 'old soul' obsessed with taking her own picture with her cellphone every five seconds?

That seems harsh, but the empty heads of SoCal is brilliantly portrayed here. Self-absorbed, vain, nonsensical. Low self-esteem is loud in SoCal, including those who project seeming confidence, like the starlets themselves. While amusing, it actually shows how tragically sad that famous airheads are seen as desirable and envied. The lack of mature adults to guide their kids conveniently turn children into junkies at an early age. Is it any wonder they age so hideously by the time they're 30? Just like Hollywood in general - a circus, a wasteland of ugliness if you care to be honest. Skankiness rule here, beneath the clothes and glitter. And it gets more blatant by the day, you no longer believe that stars are so envied anymore, at least with people of good sense.

Emma Watson is really good. She portrayed the character based on Alexis Neiers, as described in the book really well. Occasionally, her posh Brit accent can be caught, but overall, she's believable as the silly, vapid Valley girl. Leslie Mann is not my favorite actress, but she does a wonderful job as the equally ineffective and childish mother. I must say, most of the actors chosen are really gorgeous, especially Watson and Katie Chang who plays ringleader Rebecca. In the book, it keeps describing certain girls as 'beautiful' and 'pretty' and you find it's just hype to sell the story. Katie Chang is beautiful and very cool, the real Rachel Lee was a shock and Alexis Neiers and her friend Tess were actually cheap looking! As someone I know like to say, SoCal is full of trailer trash type with money and you can't take them out of their mentality - just yet.

Overall, it's a good wake-up call to watch this movie. It reminds just how low society have fallen in certain parts of social norm and how low standards have dropped in picking who to idolize. C'mon, be serious. Audrina Partridge?? Lindsay Lohan...?

In the Special Features segment, Paris Hilton hits a new low. You can tell how eager she is to revive the spotlight interest in herself, letting her actual home to be used in the movie and later taking viewers on a tour of her closet and jewellery collection - just flaunting every bit - perhaps hinting that she wouldn't mind getting robbed again? After all,  she has so much stuff and they hold no real value for her; and the robbery does indicate that some silly kids still had an interest in her, and she has been a bore in the paparazzi's view these last few years. She is seen smirking throughout the needless interview here. Like her past interviews, conversation and quotes, nothing that she says make any real sense and she has no idea what she is talking about, herself.

Thank you Sofia Coppola. This is a good portrayal overall and I was both tickled and aghast. Rent the DVD, if you don't want to buy it. It's still good for getting a regain grounded perspective after seeing the pointless focus some people can have.",1384387200,2,3253,4.777580071174377
2881114,5,6304097050,"Great movie, especially if you live in los angeles. It reminds me of when I was 20 and partying in LA clubs next to Paris Hilton and Linsday Lohan.

I watched the reality show ""Pretty Wild"" when it aired years ago and was highly entertained, but what I missed from the reality show was actually getting to see the kids stealing and partying in the rich celebrities' houses. And Sofia Coppola showed us that in The Bling Ring. And it feels very real. Here's what I recommend: watch The Bling Ring, then watch Pretty Wild (on Netflix), then watch The Bling Ring again... then watch Pretty Wild again.

2881117,5,6304097050,"This movie really has everything; there is good acting, music, and a story. Sofia Coppola always impresses me with her films and this is my favorite work from her. The Bling Ring starts with a collection of images similar to the teaser trailer; this really helps set the mood. Also, the story is told almost backwards, which also creates an interesting way to view the robbery sequences. Had Sofia Coppola decided to show the robberies without the arrest, the robberies would have only been glamorous; instead they are fun but you know, deep down inside, that something bad is going to happen. The whole movie is very light and funny, creating more of a parody of these teenagers. Although the film plays out like a parody, Emma Watson plays her role very seriously which makes her character, specifically, very realistic. There are scenes that are very silent and still; these scenes seem even slower because the robbery scenes are so fast. The point being, they are robbing houses for the thrill. I would suggest this movie to anyone but at the same time, if you do not like Sofia Coppola's other movies, you will also not like this one.",1384214400,,1139,4.728643216080402
2881118,5,6304097050,"If ever a subject was perfect for Sofia Coppola's touch, this was it.  A huge fan of hers, I ignored the load of crappy reviews and ordered the film anyway - glad I did.  The subjects in The Bling Ring are similar to those in previous films: whether Marie Antoinette, the characters in Virgin Suicides or the Bling-ers, these are teenagers in the process of making a transition to adulthood.  Instead of using a narrative style, Coppola goes for what most of us experienced in our own teenage years - blinding speed, mental snapshot images of people/events, often vacuous preoccupations and ever-changing interests.

For the Bling Ring, this group bought all of the hype and obsession surrounding celebrities and their trappings and tried to up their own personal stock by stealing pieces of property from the people they idealized.  That this actually happened isn't what surprising; that it hasn't happened MORE is surprising.

The actors did a fantastic job of portraying rudderless, self-absorbed, completely detached group of young people.  Not ONE was concerned with the morality of what they did; and only one had limited concerns about getting caught.  Watching the film, I was struck what blank canvasses each appeared to be - defined only by what they wore.

I LOVED this film!!! It is an absolutely fascinating story and Sofia Coppola's deft touch brought this story to life in such a way that the viewer feels like a fly on the walls of the events and in the minds of the group.",1384041600,,1490,4.857707509881423

The Rebecca character was really something else, and the actress who played her did a very good job, as I really disliked the character; total disregard for other people's property, but then all the characters shared that trait. so story was a fail for me, largely because disliked/disapproved of lead characters and the writer didn't do enough to humanize most of them. the best writing was done with the young man character, I sort of got him. most of the young women characters just seemed vacuous, except the Rebecca character; in another story, she'd have the makings of a really scary villain. on the plus side, the actresses/actors were all very good, and I got to learn how police execute a search/arrest warrant.",1382572800,,1678,4.911971830985915

2881149,1,6304097050,"There's no plot in this movie. Basically, it depicts a group of rich, and spoiled teenagers burglarized the homes of several celebrities over a period believed to be from October 2008 through August 2009.  They netted  about $3 million in cash and high end goods.

Their victims included Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Meagan Fox, Orlando Bloom, etc. It showed the victims made it easy for the thieves to steal. For example, people left keys in their unlocked cars. They also left drug, cash, and credit cards there. Some did not even lock their house doors. One victim even left the house key under the door mat.

After the burglary, the teenage were shown doing drugs, trying on the stolen clothes, selling them, partying in famous bars in Los Angeles and burglarizing again. Oh, they're so brazen about their actions that they even posted their photos holding the stolen goods on the web!
That's all the movie was about. The actors did not use the real names of the thieves.
In reality, they all got a slap on  their wrists as punishments.

It is much more interesting and factual to watch Bling Ring on American Greeds episode even though it lasts only 23 minutes.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:

Production Budget: N/A
Domestic:  $5,845,732
+ Foreign:  $13,300,000
= Worldwide:  $19,145,732

According to hollywoodreporter dot com, Bling Ring's budget was 8 million dollars plus. So, it's a flop in North America. However, worldwide, it took in 9 million dollars more than its budget.

We knew it was a movie about a gang of delinquent teenagers who rob celebrity homes. But in the end, the movie seemed less about that then about the continuous stream of gross language and nightclub drug scenes. Sophia seemed intent in trying to shock the viewer.

It appears that Coppola got the script from 'The Bling Ring' article on Wikipedia while the actors ad libbed for some lousy dialogue. The characters lacked any kind of substance and the awful acting from all except the male lead and Leslie Mann made me uncomfortable. They portrayed pot-smoking, coke-sniffing druggies, yet didn't even know how to hold or smoke a cigarette.

Emma Watson must have channelled Rachel Zoe and snorted pink bubbles in between scenes to play a caricature-style valley girl. Her American valley girl accent was cringeworthy.

 When I saw 'Lost in Translation' a few years ago, I wrote Sofia Coppola off as a complete neophyte and someone who was riding on the coattails of her famous father. Now I must grudgingly concede that Ms. Coppola has markedly improved as a director. 'The Bling Ring', based on the true story of a bunch of California high school students, who burglarized homes of rich celebrities, has the look and feel of a well-crafted music video. In fact, Coppola employs a slew of contemporary tunes (mostly rap), that give the film its raw edge.

The story is rather straightforward, following the basic facts of the case against the amoral teenagers who commit the 'bling ring' burglaries. The main anti-hero protagonist is Rebecca who befriends Marc; both attend a high school for underachievers and dropouts. When Marc mentions that one of his well-off acquaintances is out of town, Rebecca has no qualms about convincing him to burglarize the acquaintance's house where they make off with a handbag, cash and keys to the victim's Porsche, which is used to go on an extended shopping spree.

Marc and Rebecca meet up with her airhead friend, Nikki (well-played by Emma Watson) and her two adopted sisters and bump into celebrities Kirsten Dunst and Paris Hilton at a nightclub. Marc and Rebecca realize that Paris Hilton is out of town while doing some research on the internet and they then concoct a plan to burglarize her home.

Paris Hilton gave Coppola permission to use her home for filming the burglary scenes and one comes away amazed at just how many clothes and 'bling', Paris Hilton owns. Hilton's home is burglarized by the Bling Ring on multiple occasions and other celebrities are targeted including Audrina Patridge, Megan Fox and Orlando Bloom. Unfortunately, the burglary scenes become tiresome and after awhile, one realizes that there's not much to this 'mini-documentary' of sorts, at all!

Coppola does well in highlighting the utter vacuousness and amorality of the principals. A few plot developments keep us mildly interested including the sale of a box of Rolex watches to a boyfriend of one of the Bling Ring and the pilfering of a gun from one of the homes, which goes off accidentally, while another one of the Bling Ring, stupidly plays with it.

Coppola deftly illustrates the gang's undoing, including a montage of their Facebook posts as well as the news coverage (including surveillance footage) that ultimately leads to their final downfall (capture by police and conviction and sentencing).

The Bling Ring's principals, Rebecca and Marc, receive the longest prison sentences (4 years) but the others get off rather easy. After Nikki does a short stint in jail with Lindsay Lohan, she claims to have learned a lot from her experience but has a hard time accepting responsibility (her story is basically that she was led astray). Now Nikki has a website devoted to self-promotion, and one wonders if she's really learned anything from her experiences.

Coppola has done well with the actors here and has learned to use the camera adroitly. It's just that the material is slight and events just seem to repeat themselves one too many times throughout the film. Coppola's detached eye captures the lunacy and moral failings of these airhead teenagers as well as the crass materialism of the Bling Ring victims. 'The Bling Ring' is a well crafted film but would be better off as a TV movie.",1380672000,,3456,4.934595524956971

Their complete lack of remorse is disgusting and the story left me feeling very sad for our fame-obsessed society.

The fault probably lies with Sofia Coppola whose writing and directing are flabby at best.  All your basically left with is 1) Emma Watson sure has mastered an American accent well and 2) Taissa Farmiga sure looks a lot like her older sister, Vera.

2881185,4,6304097050,"I don't really understand why a lot of people were disappointed and expected more from the characters. They are shallow people doing bad things. How do you expect them to be ""deep"" and develop throughout the movie? I knew right off the bat, that this movie is a social commentary/satire, not unlike the genius Spring Breakers, which many people just didn't understand either. It was made to be over the top and subtly (or perhaps not so subtly) criticize the life style of these characters. The clothes they wear, the things they say and how they say it, their priorities, their selfishness, etc. I mainly picked this up because I love Emma Watson. I mean, who doesn't? She was great in all the Harry Potter movies and she blew me away in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower. In this movie, she played a heartless, vain b**** very well. I thought she was brilliant. Everyone else did a good job as well, but Emma Watson being, you know, Emma Watson, just radiates star power, so she stole the movie in every scene she acted in. This movie is very 'this is how it starts, and this is how it inevitably, OBVIOUSLY, ends'. Even if you don't know anything about the true story, you know right away that their ending is not a happy ending. I suppose, the only character you can care about is the male lead. He was probably the one character to express remorse or reluctance to what they were doing, but that doesn't mean he didn't enjoy some of his time in his thievery with his girlfriends. He did partake in it and he did deserve what he got. Although I did feel bad, even though it was totally expected, when s*** hit the fan, his almost-like-a-sister ""best friend"" back stabbed him. Like I said, this movie is about shallow people. You go in knowing that, then you won't be disappointed. Trust me, you're not going to be awed or moved by this movie. It's very simple and well done. It did its job. I praise all the actors for their wonderful acting and I highly praise the director for her wonderful directing. It was a very beautiful looking film, riddled with beautiful looking people, who clearly are not so beautiful underneath. This kind of movie makes me very happy I did not grow up with that lifestyle.

2881192,5,6304097050,"This is NOT an after school special. If you want a happy ending with a speech: ""I guess I learned my lesson now, I love you mom and dad,"" you will NOT find that here. As someone who grew up in Southern California and went to high school with people like those portrayed in the movie, I think ""The Bling Ring"" was spot-on. Sofia Coppola did a great job of making this true story darkly funny, visceral, and edgy, without trivializing the problems it presents.

My best friend and I laughed A LOT the first time we saw this. We also cringed, gasped, almost cried, and spent hours afterward talking about wealth and materialism. The cinematography keeps you on the edge of your seat. The music coordinates perfectly with the mood of each scene, so even when you're totally against what the characters are doing, you feel like you are a part of it. The script is quotable and thought-provoking, and the actors are believable. Katie Chang is perfect to play the ""ring leader"", delivering her lines with such confident nonchalance that you understand why the other kids would follow her so blindly. Israel Broussard plays Marc, a depressed, misguided boy who is easy to relate to. Emma Watson plays Nicki, a drug-addled wannabe model, and does a very good job of delivering her hilarious lines in a convincing Valley Girl accent.

I'm not giving too many details because I HATE when reviews include spoilers, but it should suffice to say that this film is equal parts jarring and fun. It will scare you, because the obsession with material wealth and social status is a very real issue, but it will make you laugh so hard you cry.

2881202,5,6304097050,"This is a quote from one of the members of the bling ring at her trial for felony breaking and entering.  I am a fan of Sofia Coppola, and I have to place this film in the context of her work.  These kids are the entitled offspring of the American autocracy, the rich.  Their aspirations are the ""stuff"" of the richer and the famous.  They have come of age as the peers of Paris Hilton whose claim to fame is in fact fame.  In taking her belongings, they become a step closer to her notoriety.  When the bill comes due, they point to each other as the leader.  Hate the world that created these kids, but do not turn away.  If we do not understand them, they will haunt us.  If we do face their reality, it mandates us to change.

Just as in ""Marie Antoinette"", this movie has major ""stuff porn"".  If you recognize the brand labels, turn the mirror on yourself.  The acting could not be more ""spot on"".  No one who has been to high school, or still does, can fail to recognize these kids with self esteem to spare, that nonetheless takes a hefty price tag to support.",1379721600,,1067,4.2227722772277225
2881203,4,6304097050,"A quick scan of rotten tomatoes before this rental showed many criticisms hinged on a lack of character development and unclear meaning.  This is why the film is good.  Among all characters there were no facile attempts to create a plot or dialogue that goes beyond theft and the desire for fashion.  No dumb love story.  No developed background into the families that these kids are brought up in (aside from the mutual detachment of the kids and parents).  This lack of development and depth seems to be an appropriate commentary on the thought processes that accompany this crime, there isn't much regard for forethought or consequence.  Perhaps this is what I liked the most, is as a viewer, we are asked to simply watch and see what happens, which isn't a long shot from what the characters are doing themselves.  It's mindless, but it's fun (and it looks good in the process).  Aren't films allowed to be just that?  If one wishes, there is plenty of substrate here for a commentary on the thinking that modern culture (I'm thinking mostly of social media) produces.

Not to mention the poetic license taken with a plot that would show us 'celebrities', many celebrities that would habitually leave their houses unlocked, purses in the car, cash stashes in easy-to-find places and no security in this day and age.

The celebrities post their schedule so everyone knows when they are out of town. Using Google and Google Earth their homes are easy to pinpoint and it seems their security is less than my broken window double-wide guarded by feral kittens.

The film, like the event, makes a statement about when consumerism and celebrity society collide. I found the movie amusing in that regard. After they rob Paris Hilton for the third time, someone asks, ""Won't she know?""

Someone answers, ""She's Paris.""

When Rebecca gets arrested she asks, ""Did you talk to any of the victims?""

Officer: ""I talked to all the victims.

2881206,2,6304097050,"""The Bling Ring"" tells the story of a group of teenagers who break into the homes of celebrities and steal clothing, jewelry, and money.  It is based on actual events.  It is a disaster. Its only redeeming feature is that it only lasts 90 minutes.  The female characters are interchangeable, including Emma Watson, whose appearance is garnering the most publicity. Her only memorable scene comes at the end of the film, where Nicki (Watson) is being interviewed for television.  Nicki admits is was hard being on the same cellblock as Lindsay Lohan, one of the victims.  No feeling of guilt, no remorse, and a touch of self pity.
  Some flattering comments on ""The Bling Ring"" from reviewing outlets must be in jest.  ""Witty and Arresting"" Entertainment Weekly.  This is wit?  No dialogue, no character development, repetitious, and boring. By the second heist, you can't wait for the police to show up.  ""Arresting""?  I'll say.  ""Teenage fun""?  Let me count the ways: first degree burglary, grand theft auto, illegal possession and use of a controlled substance, interstate transportation of stolen property, and sale of stolen property.

2881221,4,6304097050,"There is now a book, which expanded upon the original article this movie used as its inspiration.  If you need more depth, it is in the book.  But Sofia Coppolla nails an essential sub culture in Los Angeles today which is young people who aspire to be the people who are famous for being famous.  Since they can't be them, they steal from them instead.

One initial big difference between the movie and reality is that the actors portraying the real people are better looking, especially the Asian ringleader girl.  As you see the film versions walk down the street in all of their stolen stuff, they do look as good as their celebrity counterparts.  But of course this is because they ARE the real thing.  Emma Watson, for one, is a much bigger celebrity than Paris Hilton can ever hope to be (because Watson actually has talent).  I wonder if it wouldn't have been a better idea to use more ordinary looking real people.  I would have liked to see all of the bling NOT transforming them into beautiful people.  One exception is that I think the real world guy involved from the very beginning is even better looking than the actor playing him.

Perhaps it is because I am an older person that I also found the parenting, or really lack thereof, so fascinating.  Most of these kids were from divorced or blended families.  There were people living in these households who were also rather temporary members whether as pseudo kids or pseudo parents.  There is also no supervision of these young people whatsover.  They can go out any night of the week, party all night, drink, take drugs, etc.,

This is not on the same level as Coppolla's best known work LOST IN TRANSLATION.  But I did find it oddly mesmerizing.

2881222,4,6304097050,"What makes this movie so fascinating is that it's true.  Five spoiled LA kids actually committed burglaries on the homes of rich and famous celebrities stealing designer clothing, jewelry, cash and drugs.  These weren't kids who were from poor families or who were stealing to fund a drug habit.  They were all from upper middle class households and the burglaries were more of a way to connect with the celebrities who were their idols.  With the money and items they stole, they were given access to a whole lifestyle, one that they envied and practically worshipped through the constant feed of social media and celebrity websites.  The group became celebrities themselves in their own social circles because they bragged about their accomplishments and showed off pictures of each other inside the star's private homes.  Eventually, someone turns the kids in and they are all arrested.  None, however, show real remorse for their actions.  A few of the girls ended up getting a reality television show for a while solely as a result of their popularity and being part of the burglar bunch.  This movie completely brings home the ridiculous nature of our country's obsession with celebrities and how that obsession affects young people.  The film has its funny moments as well as moments that are really sad.  The acting is all spot on.  Emma Watson is dead on as one of the ring leaders and Leslie Mann as the cluelessly pathetic mother of three of the girls involved is hilarious but still sympathetic.  Even the group members who ended up spending some minimal time in jail seem to have brushed it all off and continued their lives without ever realizing what has actually happened.  The feeling of entitlement that they all have is still driving them and they fully capitalize on their notoriety without ever stopping to realize that they've been convicted of a crime, a bad thing. Are we becoming a world obsessed with fame and celebrity?  The Bling Ring makes a strong case that we are, and with websites like TMZ and radar online providing that constant drip of photos and info into our veins, it's actually pretty easy to agree.

2881232,5,6304097050,"Innocence lost due to the struggling life of stardom is something that Sophia Coppola likes to explore.  Maybe it's her background, being brought up in a household that revolved around the arts and was always smothered by fame.  In fact, `Somewhere', her least well known film, is said to be an autobiography of sorts (with regards to her childhood with her father).  Yes, fame, fortune and the emptiness that comes along with it is something that Coppola has staked her career on.  From the solemn romanticism of `Lost in Translation' to the flamboyant ostracism of `Marie Antoinette' to the quiet understanding of `Somewhere', Coppola has exploited nearly every facet of fame and the disastrous effects it has on those caught up in it.

With `The Bling Ring', Coppola moves away from the more intimate aspects of fame and dissects the dangers that that very drug has, not on those who have it by on those who want it.  One could call to mind the fascination Coppola flirted with in her very first film, `The Virgin Suicides'.  In her debut she immortalized average girls by focusing on the neighborhood boys caught up in an obsession of sorts with their very being.  Here, Coppola takes that obsession and kicks it up a few dozen notches, using the real life story of a group of kids who took their media fueled celebrity obsessions to the extreme.

I think we've all seen the videos.  They circulated YouTube a few years back, and E! made it a point of following these girls and their stories, especially the outspoken Nicki Moore, and so when we see something like `The Bling Ring' it is easy to assume that this is nothing more than exploitation of the very thing that motivated these young women (and young man) to engage in such reckless and offensive behavior.  You are what you eat, and glamming up celebrity in this way can be seen as adding to the problem.

Watch the trailer and keep on thinking that way if you want, but watch the movie and find something very different.

What I love about Sophia Coppola, the director, is that she has a nuanced way of etching out so much truth in the details.  You can't help but feel the delicate manner in which she sets up her scenes, even the more fast paced and seemingly flamboyant ones.  She understands how to mold each scene so as to find something deeper below the shallow exteriors.  She's been doing this for years.  Watch `Marie Antoinette' and watch Coppola find so many shades of color in a rather straightforward storyline.  Here is no exception.  While scenes fly by with teens engaging in parties, drugs, drinking, robberies; all of which laced with this feeling of cool or `fun', one can't ignore the obvious drain of innocence and the compelling character study (personal at that) that Sophia delivers to us.

Let's be honest.  We are obsessed, as a culture, with celebrities.  They are superior to us.  We watch them with baited breath.  We want what they wear, we eat what they eat, we fantasize about them sexually, we watch where they go, what they watch, who the listen to, who they date, where they vacation, what they feed their children, how they dress their children.  The list goes on and on and quite frankly none of us can escape it if we wanted to.  What is more disheartening is that this has trickled down into a generation of teenagers (and younger) who want nothing more than to be famous.  The Paris Hilton's and the clutter of talentless kids from shows about being rich (much like `The Hills') has bred a world full of people who feel that they don't have to contribute anything or merit to be successful and have legions of fans, and the sad truth is that they are right.  What I found so interesting about Coppola's `expos&eacute;' so-to-speak is that she didn't stop there.  No, she didn't rest at merely singling out the media obsessions that provoked these kids, but she touches upon something even darker and more disturbing.

As young Marc mentions on the outset of the film, people today are drawn to the Bonnie and Clyde, the dangerous.  More than being famous and being rich, people are fascinated with those who break the laws that confine us.  As we meet young Rebecca we see a young woman not in want of anything and yet she is a compulsorily stealer.  She can't help it.  She checks cars, she snags purses, she breaks into empty houses and eventually she allows her clear obsession with the stars to force her into trying to attain their life, if even just for a minute.  It isn't always about the `things' but about the places.  Watch the way she can't leave Paris's house until she gets a picture using her phone.  Watch the way she ignites with glee over sharing this moment with her friends, drinking Paris's booze and trying on her clothes.  She takes delight in their knowledge of her actions, because she wasn't afraid to do the dirty and because of her they are all having fun.

But notice how easy it was for her to shut it all off, which speaks to an almost darker truth.

Yes, `The Bling Ring' is fun.  I smiled at the sequences and the way the film's depictions of teen rebelliousness was framed (great cinematography by the late Harris Savides) and the use of music (Coppola is a queen at that) is inspired and adds so many layers of edgy abandon to the film.  I relished in Emma Watson's glorious reenactment of Nicki's `put on' persona and I ogled the eye candy (both the bodies and the clothing) and yet leaving the theater I'm left with a deepened sadness for the state of our society as a whole.  For me, `The Bling Ring' could be this year's `The Social Network', a film that captures the state of an era, a people, a generation.  It casts light on the current pursuit of happiness, or what the media projects that happiness to be.

While Sophia has clearly shown us that fame isn't always what it appears, she masterfully shows us that the pursuit of that said `fame' can be an even uglier, lonelier and more crippling experience altogether.",1376524800,23,5964,4.6007568590350045
2881233,4,6304097050,"I totally loved this movie. After Lifetime's little disaster, I heard there would be another version and I wasn't very sure about it, but everything changed when I heard that Sofia Coppola would direct it, and I immediately knew it would be amazing.

The film has amazing actors (especially Israel Broussard and Emma Watson, and in this movie, she proves that she can play any role besides the ""good girl role""; this time a bimbo), the way the story is told (not as cheesy as the Lifetime version), this one is darker, but lighter at the same time, and more appealing for teenagers. I just wish they would had shown more than the robberies (the film has like 4 or 5 robbery scenes, which takes a lot of minutes off the film, instead of showing us how their life was on High School, or when they did something else besides shopping and clubbing), the psychological sides of other characters besides Marc would had been amazing. But what makes this movie so special, is that the story is not about stealing stuff from celebrities, but also the things we would do for acceptance and to feel like we're part of something.

Overall, if you enjoyed Spring Breakers, you will like the Bling Ring, and don't listen to bad reviews, it's awesome.",1374883200,3,1236,4.613636363636363
2881234,5,6304097050,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is quite obviously not for everyone. It has long boring sequences of teens talking and having a great time. This is entertaining to some. I found it quite interesting because of the fact that teens actually behave this way. At least The Bling Ring did. There were scenes when you would just wonder why it was drawn out this long. Why they showed them robbing a house for this long or showing them just basking in their glory. Showing them partying with the money, clothes, and jewelery stolen from all those celebrities. But hello? This is exactly what you're expecting from a movie like this. What else did you want to see? Just a warning before you read the IMDB or Rotten Tomato reviews. However if you always wondered why people love pop culture and wonder why people obsess over celebrities than this movie is for you. It quite simply tells why.

Watson plays a California teenager who's thirst for expensive and luxurious things is just the one thing that stands out about her character. Her character is loosely based off of one of the actual robbers in the Bling Ring, Alexis Neiers. She portrays her great. Even though throughout the movie you'll try to listen for Watson's British accent. The movie will be nothing but boring for people who are not interested in this subject or even interested in the true story about the The Bling Ring robbers. However, if you are interested in the facts about our society's fascination with pop culture then you should definitely watch this movie. The acting is great and who doesn't like to leave their life for a moment and live in the glamor?

I like to think of this movie as almost a parody of teen life. However, the fact that these specific teenagers actually acted this way is just funny and amazing to me. It's almost hard not to laugh, but also hard not to sit and realize that this is actually sad. These teens committed a felony crime by stealing millions of dollars worth of clothing and jewelry from human beings who are well known in our world. The movie ends with a sense of justice in after seeing all the good consequences of their actions it also showed equally the negative consequences of their actions. However funny this might be to some, I like the way Sophia Coppola doesn't ignore the fact that this is wrong and disturbing, but than again they are just teenagers having ""fun"" which doesn't justify their actions but rather explains them. In a way I agree with Emma Watson in her interview that this is kind of a political movie, but I also disagree with her when she says that it's not a parody because it is.",1374624000,11,2626,4.561440677966102
2881235,5,6304097050,"Sofia Coppola dishes out another intriguing, yet slow- burn indie flick. This time, Sofia delves into a much more hard- hitting story of teenagers infatuation with glitz and glamour. Sofia has her certain way of directing: she tends to focus on characters for a long time with no movement of the camera. To some, this can get tedious, but for anyone going in not just for the story, but for the directing itself, The Bling Ring delivers Coppola's usual directing. The story can get repetitive (they steal from many houses and occasionally go back to the same house, so it begins to be the same thing every time), but I knew what it was going to be like because I did much research on the case before seeing the movie. Final Consensus: The Bling Ring shows Coppola making a ripped from the headlines story come true in the best way possible. Glossy and articulate, The Bling Ring is an fascinating turn for Coppola and presents her at her desirable best.",1374451200,3,953,4.6117647058823525
2881236,3,6304097050,"Based on true events, director Sofia Coppola gathers a couple handfuls of young starlets and gives them some pretty meaty roles.  As portrayed, this gaggle of teens (Katie Chang, Israel Broussard, Emma Watson, Claire Julian, Taissa Farmiga, Georgia Rock and Carlos Miranda) play stereotyped Hollywood dimwits who decide to invade famous personality's homes.  At first these robberies are done on a lark, but then they realize that there is money to be made.

Essentially ignored or pampered by their clueless parents, their goals are to be the next Paris Hilton.  Speaking of Paris, she allowed the film to be partially shot in her actual home.  This film won't do much for her image, starting with the throw pillows that have her picture on them.  Jeez.  I thought Emma Watson and Taissa Farmiga, playing adoptive sisters Nicki and Sam, did the most with what they were given.  Sometimes funny, especially when it came to their goals in life, sometimes serious, but mostly just sad.

Fortunately these kids left their calling cards all over the place, including being photographed in the act by security cameras and by bragging to their friends.  Perhaps the only ones dumber are the celebrities who leave their doors open, their cars unlocked and wads of money and jewelry laying around.  This isn't a great film, but has enough panache to be just interesting enough to watch.",1372204800,,1378,4.973799126637554
2881237,2,6304097050,"It's relatively safe to say that there is a strange, disturbing interest that society has taken in the lives of celebrities.  The life of various celebrity personalities is the serious topic of conversation on a daily basis - via television, internet, and any other vehicle of news information.  While the next juicy piece of celebrity gossip borders voyeurism, it still gives us a glimpse of what it's like to live amongst the rich and famous. Celebrity obsession has become so intense in some cases that it has actually been deemed a medical disorder, called celebrity worship syndrome (CWS).  In 2008 and 2009, a group of teenagers became so enthralled with celebrities and their ""things"" that they actually Googled celebrity addresses and broke-in to their homes, stealing millions of dollars' worth of clothing, jewelry, and other items.  This group of teenage thieves was a group now known as The Bling Ring.

Directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), The Bling Ring stars Katie Chang as Rebecca, a fame-obsessed high school student that befriends the new kid in school, Marc (Israel Broussard).  The pair quickly bond over fashion and celebrity obsession, and spend their time ripping off cars, houses, and partying at popular night clubs.  Rebecca and Marc, along with their circle of friends, including Nicki (Emma Watson), Chloe (Claire Julien), and Sam (Taissa Farmiga), decide to start ripping off celebrity houses.  Over the course of a year, the group - known as ""The Bling Ring,"" break into the homes of Paris Hilton, Audrina Patridge, Orlando Bloom, and a handful of other A-list celebrities.  Leslie Mann and Gavin Rossdale also star in supporting roles.

Initially, The Bling Ring's plot was overshadowed by one of its stars, dubbed the film that ""Emma Watson sheds her squeaky clean image.""  However, the film is much more complex than simply being a film where its star sheds her image.  Still, if you were expecting the former Harry Potter star to take a page out of Vanessa Hudgen's playbook (check out Spring Breakers for details), you'll be severely disappointed - even though she does spend a brief scene with a stripper pole.  In fact, Watson isn't even the main character for the majority of the film, giving way to relative unknowns Katie Chang (Rebecca) and Israel Broussard (Marc), who dazzle and overshadow the Potter alum.  Sadly, as the film progresses, the initial importance of the Rebecca/Marc relationship loses its luster, as the plot shifts to focus more on greed and drug abuse.  The film, which starts with so much potential, loses direction and misses its mark, spending far too much time on Watson's melodramatic attitude and constant application of lip gloss.

To be honest, The Bling Ring will leave you with a simple question like, ""where were the parents during all of this?""  The fact that this film is based on actual events is the reasoning behind such a simple question.  It's hard to imagine that coming home at late hours, fat roles of cash in your pocket, and endless amounts of flashy new attire doesn't catch the eye of at least one involved parent (apparently adolescent smoking in your bedroom has never been more innocent).  Regardless, Leslie Mann does in fact portray one involved parent in a film full of teens.  Mann portrays Laurie (Emma Watson's character's mother) in the film, doing her best imitation of a classy Christian parent as she raises her three daughters (even though the whole family is more like devils in sheep's clothing).  Regardless, Mann significantly stands out in her role, shining brightly as the delusional mother encouraging her teenage daughter's desires for Hollywood fame - for all the wrong reasons, of course.

Instead of focusing on the critical themes - like society's obsession with looks, fashion, and an ambitious night life - it's much more interesting to focus on all the things wrong and amusing about this film.  For instance, high school teens spend their time out-and-about partying in nightclubs `til all hours of the morning?  ...not to mention they're getting bottle service, even though they're underage?  Plus, a DUI on the way home totally isn't a big deal  at all.  Instead, let's focus on the people who aren't smart enough to lock their house or car, and get ripped off for their troubles.  And, why ""shop where the celebrities shop"" when you can just let yourself into their house and rip them off instead?

Sarcasm aside, this bothersome film paints a dangerous picture of the massively divided and culturally diverse world we live in today.  Speaking of cultural diversity, it wouldn't be right not to mention another film franchise that's chalk full of cultural diversity - The Godfather.  Obviously, it's completely unfair and flat out insulting to compare The Bling Ring to The Godfather, but The Bling Ring is such a waste of a viewing experience that I'm forced to stoop to this level to remind myself that the name Copolla once stood for brilliant filmmaking.

In the end, The Bling Ring is nothing more than a satire based on the Vanity Fair article, ""The Suspects Wore Louboutins"" by Nancy Jo Sales.  Regardless, meaningful time was wasted blasting Kanye West music and obsessing over inanimate object.  It could have easily been used for character depth, instead of the relentless glorification for the ""celebrity status.""  At the same time, The Bling Ring exudes stupidity, embraces envy, and sends a message that the world's priorities are in a state of disarray.  Despite starting with promise, followed by quickly veering off-course, Emma Watson still attempts to save the flick by doing her best impression of a slutty Christian, aka real-life celebrity robber, Alexis Neiers - who is either a complete simpleton or an evil genius (depending how you look at it, since she obviously got a TV deal out of the whole ordeal). Spoiler alert:  it doesn't work.

THE BLING RING is best looked at as a crime satire. Some may think this film can't decide what it wants to be, which I can understand, however I don't think it takes any of the quality away. If anything, the pacing can be awkward. There are some great comedic parts, such as Rebecca (Chang) trying to steal Paris Hilton's dog, breaking and entering with no qualms, and Emma Watson's perfect portrayal or Alexis Neiers.

As a cautionary tale, it does show that teens are getting better at being 'out of control'. Prescription drugs are the go-to drugs for many, there is a lot of cocaine use throughout the film. Clearly these teens are lost, amoral, vapin, vain and selfish. I think that Coppola allows us to see who they really are; yes they're not the most likable clique of teens, but most can identify with wanting to be 'a part of the Hollywood lifestyle'.

Playing almost as a docudrama, the film is visceral and has an art-house feel to it. It was filmed flawlessly. Yeah you might hate Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and these kids but why can't we accept them for who they are? Especially if they have no apologies like Rachel Lee (Katie Chang's character) and take what they want without hesitation.

If only they focused this much on their grades... right?

2881239,4,6304097050,"""The Bling Ring"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the now-familiar story of how a group of teenagers living in suburban Los Angeles, with too much time on their hands and an insatiable appetite for ""bling"", decide to start robbing houses of celebrities while they are out of town. I am not spoiling the plot when I tell you that the ""group of five"" (4 girls and 1 guy), along with a couple of others, eventually get found out and caught. The first 50-55 min. of the movie deal with the break-ins and the remainder of the movie looks at what happens after their arrests.

Several comments: this is the 5th feature movie directed by Sofia Coppola, and as has been the case with her previous films, this movie is highly stylish in the way it looks at and brings the lives of these teenagers. In fact, the movie is eye-candy pretty much from start to finish. Coppola wrote the script based on the 2010 Vanity Fair article that exposed it all in details not seen before. As to the Bling Ring members themselves: it is perhaps somewhat understandable as to why Marc would get involved with this, as he is new to the school and desparately trying to fit in and make friends. But what about the four girls? There seems no rhyme or reason, other than the ""need for greed"", while apparently lacking any and all moral compass. Equally telling is the almost entire absence of parenting. Yes, there are parents, but they are too busy or too clueless. At some point we see Marc's dad asking Marc and Nicki what they are doing (while they are smoking weed in Marc's bedroom), and when Nicki simply says ""sorry we made too much noise"", Marc's dad simply walks away. An equally telling moment is when Nicki gets interviewed by a reporter towards the end, and she gets visibily irritated when her mom (played beautiflully in a small role by Leslie Mann) says a few words (interjects herself, in Nicki's mind), and she hisses ""mom, this interview is about ME!"" Yes indeed, the ""me! me! me! culture is everywhere. The role of Nicki is played by Emma Watson, and she seems only to get better and better in her post-Harry Potter days (last year in the excellent ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and recently also in a minor role in ""This Is the End""). Can't wait to see what she'll do next.

Coppola doesn't take a strong ""social stand"" as such in the movie. Instead, she lets the camera do all the talking, easily exposing the hollowness of the bling culture. ""The Bling Ring"" opened with a lot of positive vibes at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and the screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this afternoon was reasonably well attended for a matinee. It might be the case of clever counter-programming, as it appears every week there is another superhero movie or some other mega-production movie opens (how many Iron Man 3, Man of Steel, After Earth, World War Z and other such movies can a person see in one summer?). If you are in the mood for something else, ""The Bling Ring"" may be just the thing for you. Slick and entertaining, yet exposing the moral vacuum that exists in certain environments, this movie flew by in no time. ""The Bling Ring"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1371859200,48,3165,4.5508771929824565

Having said that, it does shallow with a vengeance. The film begins with cartoon-level caricatures of Valley girls. Picture mom calling her teens down for breakfast with, Girls! Time for your Adderall. Mom of course is also a caricature.  (And truthfully, I wish Hollywood would stop featuring homeschoolers as all children of the corn flat-earthers or total flakes.  Stepmothers get a better rep from Disney But thats probably a topic for a different review...)

Emma Watson is deliciously vapid here. Not even a hint of Hermiones quiet righteousness or simmering brilliance.
Its also interesting to watch the peer pressure in play at Idiot high, and how easily the Bling Ring members move from underage drinking and skipping school to multi-million dollar robberies.  Or situations where playing with a loaded gun becomes more than a metaphor.

Clearly, the closest this film comes to Oscar material is when they rob celebrities while those actors are attending the awards ceremony. But its a good rainy afternoon diversion. And you get to see the insides of Paris Hiltons actual closet since she allowed them to film inside her mansion.
FYI  The sound track is horrendous. No idea where they got that music, but the opening song has a background droning like a running garbage disposal. I thought my TV speakers had died. And the ending song is even worse. Like someone stood on the chord buttons of an accordion and just kept standing there.

8204214,4,6304097050,"I have to say I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable. A good effort from a director who definitely approaches film making from her own unique perspective. Like other Sophia Coppola films I've seen, there is an air of ""documentary"" about this movie. It rings as authentic.

I'm not referring to the actions of these people. Rather, the behavior of the young girls committing the burglaries. I had never even heard of The Bling Ring. A quick bit of research showed that the movie seemed fairly true to the events. I mean the real thieves hit Paris Hilton's house (5 times!), and the characters in this film hit the same celebs (Wiki reports that Paris let them film at her actual house, so way-to-go Paris!).

No, but the authenticity I saw was in the way the girls behaved. Although for all the 'pot"" they smoked onscreen they never really looked all that stoned. But everything else in their language, attire, and attitude just felt real. Now it's been a pretty long time since I was a high school girl in Southern California in 2008 (as in forever, since I am a dude), but it still felt real. Great acting by those girls and the supporting cast.

And the photography was superb. They really created some moments.

So that is what got me through the film. I just flt like a fly-on-the-wall. Kinda voyeuristic. :>
