3616902,5,B001GN0DAW,"I received a screener of this DVD and watched it with my 4 year old daughter. It was an instant hit! She loved all the characters and immediately related to one child that looked just like her. She really loved learning about different cultures and recognizing some places and landmarks that she has seen in books and in our family travel photos. She literally wanted to pause it when I tried to talk to her about something so that she did not miss a second of the show.

Best of all is that I really loved the video too - the music and voices were great but not annoying like many other kid videos and there was such a wonderful, diverse and positive representation of many different people. I also really liked the combination of animated graphics and real-life imagery. It is important to me for her to see people, places, cultures, etc as they occur in the real world, not just in animation. Global Wonders is definitely on my go-to list as a great holiday gift this year!",1224201600,7,976,4.4525139664804465
3616903,5,B001GN0DAW,"We loved this video! My son Charlie made us watch it 5x. He loved the music and could not stop talking about all the characters.
It is very educational and perfect for our multi-cultural soceity. It helps promote understanding and openess to new cultures and attitudes. We highly reccomend it!",1224201600,3,293,4.88
3616904,5,B001GN0DAW,"I screened this video with my five year old daughter. She loved it!! The characters are cute and interesting, the music is great and the ""real-life"" footage is entertaining.  She was captivated throughout the entire video.... and I actually found it interesting as well. Vocabulary is introduced from several different languages - a learning experience for me too. This is a great way to expose your child to other cultures.  I look forward to more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1223856000,5,468,5.064935064935065
3616905,5,B001GN0DAW,"I get bored with most children's videos.  Really.  So imagine my surprised interest during ""Around the World"".  Hence, my first review...  I received a screener copy of ""Around the World"" at one of their shows. Global Wonders has done a great job with providing a cross-cultural, educational, entertaining experience.  The kids wanted more, I WANTED MORE!!  ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!",1223596800,2,379,5.448275862068965

8306204,2,B001GN0DAW,"Want to sum up this DVD in one sentence? How about ""Let's indoctrinate little American kids into believing Caucasian kids don't even EXIST and every playgroup is one big happy stew of Indians, Japanese, Latinos, Iranians, Africans, and 7 other semi-brown kids picked at random.""

And unless you speak with an accent, you are NOT cool. If you don't inject a foreign language phrase or word into every other sentence, you are NOT cool. If you don't find a way to praise a non-American culture each time you speak up, you are NOT cool.

I fully expected any second for all the kids to get up on a hill, hold hands, and praise Coca-Cola.

A completely nauseating production that is almost guaranteed to make any kid of European ancestry feel odd  and left out.

Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because my kids stayed perplexed  just long enough to watch it, so it saved me $5 on babysitting.",1256688000,6,889,4.525
8306205,5,B001GN0DAW,"We don't let our four year old watch too much television.  When I heard about The Global Wonders DVDs I was excited to let him watch these videos because they celebrate diversity and cultural awareness. The Global Wonders series currently features four DVD s that are aimed at children. They currently have ""Around the World,"" ""Mexico,"" ""India,"" and ""African-American."" Created by the former Executive Producer for Disney's ""Baby Einstein"", the videos opens children s eyes and ears to the worlds of various cultures through food, playing games, vocabulary and traditions.",1231804800,2,572,5.355555555555555
8306206,4,B001GN0DAW,"My 4 year old loves the movie, and we can't wait to purchase more in the series.  However, the wondervision feature will not function for us, we have tried on 4 dvd players, and the picture freezes while the kaleidoscope is on, but nothing happens, the movie resumes playing normally.  Anyone else have this issue, or is it isolated to my new copy?",1225152000,,348,4.507936507936508
8306207,5,B001GN0DAW,"Great video!  It's entertaining and educational, so I have no problem with my daughter watching it as many times as she wants.  Highly recommended.",1224633600,,147,5.083333333333333
8306208,5,B001GN0DAW,"My four year old daughter loves this series. Like most four year old girls, she can be very picky (about everything!) and this is her hands down favorite things to watch. While being very entertaining (some of the Baby and Little Einstein people are the creative forces behind this), this is also a great educational experience. Our daughter has asked us to learn more about some of the themes touched on in this series. Overall, this is very highly recommended.",1224460800,,462,4.7875
