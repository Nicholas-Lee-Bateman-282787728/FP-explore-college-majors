8687228,1,B00PAYP5II,"I really like Ashley Turner so I purchased this.  I liked the idea of the massage roller balls to help ease up tense muscles.  I'm really thin so maybe I don't have enough weight to make these roller balls affective.  When I watch her in the video, it appears the balls are almost flattened like they're made of a more pliable plastic.  I can press down on one with my foot and it still doesn't get as flat as hers looked under her shoulder.  The massage roller ball is a hard plastic with spikes that are not very pliable.  Bottom line, they're not comfortably massaging, they hurt and it's nearly impossible for me to roll over them the way she does.  Wish I had returned now, but I had just started doing yoga again and thought it may be better after I rebuilt a little muscle.  Not the case.",1435363200,4,795,4.2885906040268456
