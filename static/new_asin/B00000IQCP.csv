I just purchased a copy this past week, and gone are the segments about TV Tommy Ivo, the Green Mamba, the interviews with the driver of the Botown Express, the natural gas-powered funny car, and the hydrogen peroxide rocket car. The ONLY segments that remain completely intact from the original video, in fact, are the Masters of Disaster (probably the worst part of the original!) and the Wild Bunch.

If you've never seen this video before, It's no better or worse than the original (probably) but if you're trying to revisit this video from past viewings, beware that you may not get what you expect.",1318032000,,936,4.771604938271605
8408167,3,B00000IQCP,"Not the best drag racing video ever.  I have owned this movie since the mid-80's and it is very dated by now.  Mostly about jet cars it gives a nice overview of drag racing's wild side.  It looks like the effects were  dubbed on someone's home computer by today's standards, and a cheesy track  announcer type voice is also dubbed across every run.  The best thing about  his video is that it shows one of the very few rocket funny car runs ever!  I cherish this tape for being able to see that single run.",953856000,,506,4.252631578947368
