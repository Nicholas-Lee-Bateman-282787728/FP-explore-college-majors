It looks like this might have had the potential to be pretty hot if the jag-offs in the editing room had let the footage be.  But this is such an incongruent mess of chopped-to-pieces footage making sure you see practically nothing.  Some scenes don't even let you see between the legs at all.

What is wrong with Penthouse when it comes to video??  They have stood since the 1970s as a shining distinction from the modesty that has plagued Playboy on and off as the times changed and became horrendously conservative again.
