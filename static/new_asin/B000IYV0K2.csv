It's EXTREMELY clinical, and the entire video focuses around ""problems"" the female may have not achieving orgasm. It seems to be designed for a woman who has never explored her sexuality, ever. A majority of the video revolves around the woman exploring what her sexual parts look and feel like, and showing two basic ways to pleasure herself; through manual clitoral stimulation and with a vibrator inserted in the vagina. The instructions are very basic, and show brief examples of what to ""try."" About 3/4 of the video is devoted to these instructions.

The last 1/4 of the video gives instructions on how a man can pleasure a woman. Well, at least that's what it said. It was basic instruction on two sexual positions; missionary, and woman on top. No advice on cunnilingus, or additional ways for the man to help out. So dissapointing.

A majority of the video is sit down discussion between two sexologists, one of which reminded us of Mr. Rogers, which was kind of creepy. Even the physical examples of each basic topic made us uncomfortable, because they were so clinical (no music, just a quiet woman or quiet couple laying on a bed in a black studio set). They discuss the problems or issues surrounding a woman not able to achieve orgasm, including feeling dirty, physical trauma, stereotypes or morals set by society.

The only circumstance under which we would EVER recommend this video is to a woman who has never explored her sexuality, never had sex, or never masturbated. If you know the basics of sex, and you're looking to expand your repertoire of sexual techniques to please her, you need to look elsewhere.",1234656000,16,1878,4.73394495412844
8510868,4,B000IYV0K2,"Although the DVD had a bit of lecture and the photography was not what men  would call terribly erotic, we watched it together, and were able to laugh and fast foreward thru most of the  talking. My wife enjoyed the style of the photography  and the scenes. Also after watching it together, she was much  more open about what pleased her, and that, although seeming an indirect result, has helped our sex life. Based on those results alone we highly recommend it. Also it led us to the candida roylae videos available in adult stores, she enjoyed these a lot too.(and they are not bad from a guys viewpoint either.)",1168300800,7,615,4.5636363636363635
