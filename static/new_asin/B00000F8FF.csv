1204450,3,B00000F8FF,"Supremely bad in only the way exceedingly cheesy 80's made-for-tv movies can be! Donna Mills is chewing on the scenery all over the place trying to get this bag of cliches to fly, and it just makes you wonder how much she wished she could get material like _When Harry Met Sally_ to work with; it's a cinch her career would have been a lot bigger than _Knott's Landing_ or whatever other 80s night-time soap it was that she worked on. Brian Wimmer who plays her love interest Alex Dante played his part well too, but oof, what a dog of a plot they had to work with! Actually, all the players did a decent enough job, it was just a really poor script to work with, about on par with some late night Skinimax flick, only w/o any T&A to redeem it. Even with all its faults, it is diverting enough that you can enjoy it for its sheer hokum. Donna Mills is a delight to watch, as always: what a cutie pie she was! Make you wish she'd done more rom-coms; I'll bet she could have given Meg Ryan a run for her money as rom-com queen of the '90s! ;-)",1437350400,,1041,4.1330049261083746
1204451,5,B00000F8FF,"I loved it!!!!
Reminds me so much of me and my hubby as for I am the breadwinner in our family. The romantic scenes are tastefully done and I loved the crazy best friend. Guess this just hits close to home as I was a late bloomer to get married and work all the time. If you love sweet romance movies this is a must watch. Quality is that of an 80's movie <3",1435968000,,358,3.8513513513513513

1204755,1,B00000F8FF," except for a single line. It's cute in a pre-feminist kind of way (maybe about 10 seconds' worth), when the lead keeps saying that she doesn't want to get married, but that's all she really wants after all.

Basically, a big ""Bleah""",1400630400,,233,4.523809523809524

1204757,3,B00000F8FF,"Styles exaggerated, but yeah, people wore shoulder pads in those days.  The movie itself, I remember liking it.  Brian Wimmer was tan and young from filming China Beach.  Donna Mills in certain styles looked older and in other styles pretty and young.  The title is kind of silly because she pushes away all her boyfriends, so while it implies she is a wallflower, it is the opposite.  The stereotypes are broken a bit, but there is still the over the top Pretty Woman styles vs. the Baby Boom severe styles with a little Working Girl thrown in.  Like everyone else says, the movie is cute and nostalgic and even slightly relevant.  The title is not correct, but it does catch ones eye.  It also implies old stereo types of all women wanting to be married.  This woman wants to be married, but is afraid of relationships.  They don't really explain why, other than competing in a tough profession that requires her focus.  Then a soft-spoken male secretary applies for a job in a stream of female secretaries who worked for her with the object of getting married.  Oh boy.  Working Girl galore.  It is kind of funny no one likes Brian Wimmer's art and he has to donate it.  He says he is better at being a secretary and does the art for therapy.  So they give him a side job to even his status with the high-powered lawyer.  It is headed in a more modern direction for its day and over coming stereo types galore.  Donna Mills is quite pretty.  The side characters are also cute, and I give the dentist a break because of the main characters faux pas with him she does not see.  Then they comedic him out for plot.  Too bad not a little more conflictive triangle between him and Brian Wimmer.  He was the other love interest if there was one.  The extra guy was really silly.",1395100800,,1775,4.427244582043343
1204758,5,B00000F8FF,I know that this movie is an oldie but I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it and for whatever reason it stayed with me.  If you are a sucker for a love show then this is it.,1394150400,4,188,3.4761904761904763

1204858,1,B00000F8FF,There was no chemistry and their relationship was very fake and awkward.  Ir also felt like they were trying to push many adjenda's rather than develop a true love story such as a woman choosing work over marriage and sex is more important than a relationship.,1381795200,2,260,4.6521739130434785
1204859,3,B00000F8FF,"Okay, so it says in the Amazon description release date 2013 . . . obviously that is not the real release date, circa 1982?  1983? This one has 30 years on it.

It harkens back to a time when power suits were in and women weighed 100 pounds. There are shoulder pads. There are men with rinky-dink tiny diamond earrings . . . and ponytails. It is a time when I was too young to know what was going on at the time so I will forever look back and think, damn, that was an awesome time.

That said, this movie pains me. As a professional women, I am delighted that they did not overplay the stereotypes of professional women. Thank you. I am also pleased that the fashion of the era showed where a peplum should actually sit. At the natural waist people, natural waist!! She wears a dress with a peplum that hits just right. I wish current designers would take a cue. Peplums at the natural waist are flattering. Any higher (as they often are now) and they make you look like you're hiding a pregnancy.

But the part that pains me is the professional women has to match with the sensitive artist in east village. Seriously, what are the chances? This is a movie, sure. But damn, the premise is so painfully contrived. The dialogue is fine if basic. The best friend is adorable if super basic. Ditto for mom.

At the time perhaps it earned 3.5 stars. For nostalgia I give it 3 stars, but really, it's a 2. I won't kill you to watch it, nor will it propel you to any heights. I call it lame with no blame. More of an afternoon (Tue/Wed) special on Lifetime or O. Even if you're trying to kill a pint of chunky-monkey or a bottle of wine, you're not likely to shed a tear here. It's not good enough to watch with others. This is alone time.",1381536000,11,1733,4.22356495468278

Having been a super typist myself at a young age, even briefly ran a publicly accessible secretarial service, I had no doubt about Alex being a successful secretary.  Alex marrying his former female boss was only part of the ongoing cliche (no parallel in my own situation).  While many licensed professional liars make a full time business out of sexual harassment suits based on such close business relationships and the preponderance of subsequent divorce racketeering, such thoughts were at most a slight delaying factor for Brenda.  Recognizing the social fiction involved in this story, a viewer of this well choreographed and produced film can only wish the couple will ""live long and prosper"".",1471824000,,840,5.192592592592592
