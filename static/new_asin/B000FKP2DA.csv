This documentary goes into his early life as well as rising up the political ladder and into his term as president. I love the way frost asked him questions and just let him go into it. Great interview would recommened to anyone interested in the first Bush.",1335312000,,352,4.603174603174603
8124321,5,B000FKP2DA,"David Frost is an excellent host and the thing I prefer about this bioDVD compared to  the PBS 3 hour retrospective on him is most all of the words are spoken BY President Bush not about him.  President Bush basically leads us through his life..from sitting in his library to chatting at  the Berlin Wall Frost leads him through an well spent life to be sure.  I must say when President Bush recalled his dad for the first time crying when he told him he wanted to enlist after Pearl Harbor ...he wells up himself and you can tell he  is recalling that emotion...and Frost is the master of how  to push buttons and when to shut up and let the President be the star.

I can't say enough about this fabulous presentation...its just so much better than I had even  hoped for....if you admire President Bush you will be completely happy with this.  If you are  NOT a fan or for some reason lump him together with his son (who is NO chip off the old block)...you will come away from this admiring this amazing man.",1246492800,2,1009,4.347593582887701
