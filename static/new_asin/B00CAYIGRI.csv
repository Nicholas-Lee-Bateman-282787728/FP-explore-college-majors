Favorite Immigration Film of All Time
Read the book too... It book shows how Elia Kazan's envisioned of every moment -- each beat
He breathed every moment of this epic immigration journey into life, into words, into film.
I got to speak to Elia Kazan about the making of this film.
I told him it was my favorite and he said ""mine too"" and told
me how he mortgaged his house to make this film.
Then he told me as an artist to never give in to discouragement.
He said something to the effect of : discouragement is a scourge to artists --
never give in to discouragement ---
and I've held this dear.

This film starts with ice-men, chipping ice from a mountain, and bringing the haul on a cart,
and ends with a shoeshine....
and every moment in between is glorious.

The nature of work / the sacrifice of immigrants / what it takes to survive / the boat to Ellis Island / living under oppression / restless drive / when to lie / how to adapt / how not to give in just to sit at the king's table....  it's all here

Bravo and thank you Elia Kazan

a perfect unity of characters to create this journey.

I am a fan for life
and greatful I got to speak with him while we both lived...

long live his vision!

forever,
Annie
