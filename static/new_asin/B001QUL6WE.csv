8336441,5,B001QUL6WE,"Placido Domingo and Ana Maria Martinez create one of the most memorable live concerts in recent memory. A couple duets, but mainly alternating solos of zarzuelas (light operatic Spanish or Mexican love songs) but they bring the passion and vocal mastery of high opera to the zarzuela form. I've heard Domingo sing the male versions of these songs many times before, live and in recording, and I know they tap into a deep part of his DNA--sense memories of his father singing in his youth, fond thoughts about his childhood, etc., which evoke a special passion in his voice--but Martinez was a discovery for me personally (though since then, and because of this performance, I've bought and listened to everything she has ever recorded, precious little as it is). She doesn't just sing the notes, she sings the music, the feelings, the ideas, the meanings, the tones--the emotional swoops, dives, and leaps--and turns in one of the most remarkable performances I've ever had the pleasure to hear on disk. (And at this point, I've watched and listened to this particular performance at least a dozen times.) She doesn't sing a single line the same, a single phrase mechanically, or merely ""accurately"" and ""musically."" Every phrase is infused with freshly felt and original emotion. Highly, highly, highly recommended. Music, singing, expression, emotion doesn't get better than this, on both singers' parts, but Martinez is the star of stars, the great expressor of expressers here. Oh, before I forget: to pay credit where credit is due: Conductor Jesus Lopez-Cobos makes a deserving third, getting even the Salzburg orchestra to sound Spanish! -- P.S. As is almost alway the case, if you have the equipment and the moolala, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for better sound and image; but if you don't the DVD will do.

that while both voices are wonderful the choice of material was not to my liking.",1371081600,,212,4.170731707317073

8336444,5,B001QUL6WE,"Las interpretaciones de Plcido Domingo son siempre perfectas. Escuchar su fuerte,  dulce y armoniosa voz es una experiencia muy gratificante. Adems, Ana Mara Martnez es una encantadora persona, poseedora de una maravillosa voz. El do formado por ellos es un embeleso; incita a escharlo repetidamente.",1346976000,2,300,5.666666666666667

8336446,5,B001QUL6WE,"Pour three quarters of opera, one quarter of operette, and a large zest of French chanson in a crystal glass, stir the contents, and you get zarzuela.  Pure Spanish sensuality.  And they know all about sensuality.  Look at their Flamenco.  Domingo delivers a stellar performance, and Ana Maria Martinez raises to the same heights. The chemistry between both, and their music, is mesmerizing.
Watch the stiff upper-lip Salzburg audience, they are not able to hide their joy.  They are shuffling in their seats with pleasure.  And the orchestra!  They enjoy it.  Look at the main contrabass players.  Look at their faces.  They play and enjoy like if they were in a jam session.  Remember, this is the Mozarteum. "" Salzburg's Festival Musical ambassador"".
After listening to this dvd, and again, and again, and again, ... it is impossible not to become enamored of zarzuela.  Immediately afterwards I bought Luisa Fernanda (Domingo, Herrera, Bros).  Same sensuality.
Zarzuela merits more attention.  Domingo is a splendid ambassador.  But also Elina Garanca (a Latvian glacial blonde singing zarzuela with the same sensuality as a dark-eyed Andalusian gypsy - by the way, she lives in Andalusia-) discovered zarzuela, as did Rolando Villazon.
This dvd will enchant you, it will excite all your feelings, it will bring you more romantism than Lord Byron and Wagner together will ever be able to deliver.  Buy it, and enjoy!",1322265600,6,1420,5.108695652173913

8336448,5,B001QUL6WE,"If you like zarzuela (spanish opereta) you'll love this. If you've never experienced Zarzuela you should watch this DVD. Blueray sound is so much better and the video quality is great.
Both Placido and Ana Maria are great in this DVD. The orchestra did a great job interpreting the music. Lopez-Cobos did a great job with the orchestra. Being from Spain he understands this music very well.
Ana Maria and Placido should have a similar concert televised in the US like they do in Europe. They complement each other.
Watch ""No puede ser""  by Placido and ""Maria La O""  by Ana Maria. Incredible singing!!! Both gave me goosebumps.
Get this in Blue-Ray",1265328000,5,647,4.767857142857143
8336449,5,B001QUL6WE,"This DVD is a proof of how Zarzuela has been penetrating within the most demanding audiences everywhere. This time in Salzburg. Taken by the hand of the Birgit Nilsson Contest winner, Placido Domingo, Amor, Vida de Mi Vida is a top show that grabs your attention in every song. Ana Maria Martinez let's know once more the high quality artist she is having one of the most beautiful voices in the world today. Being Spanish speaking makes me feel proud to hear my language sang in the Mozartian city by such a couple of great singers. Domingo sounds potent with that musicality that has made him in my humble opinion the most complete opera singer of all time. A few years ago, I had the pleasure of attending the presentation of Placido Domingo and Ana Maria Martinez at the Teatro Nacional in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, which was an unforgettable night, a landmark event. This DVD reminds me of that beautiful night. This time they do it again in a German speaking country.  I advise to all zarzuela lovers, Placido fans, Ana Maria fans, opera fans, music fans and to all musically curious ones to buy this product.  You will not regret it.",1261526400,24,1149,4.655172413793103
