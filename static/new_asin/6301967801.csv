386528,5,6301967801,"Charles Dickens, like Jane Austen, is a 19th Century writer whose stories translate very well to the cinema. It is because of the strength of the characters and the fact that most of the stories have a happy ending and  the baddies end up properly punished.
David Copperfield, while somewhat  faded in the physical quality of the video itself, as a film is a perfect  example. It's full of wonderful character actors who seem to be having the  times of their lives in their parts.
Basil Rathbone is at his villanest,  as the evil stepfather, Mr. Murdstone. Roland Young is particularly  effective as the slimey Uriah Heep. And the great W.C. Fields personifies  the always hopeful Mr. Micawber. Dickens would have loved his  interpretation of the wonderful mountebank.
The only clinker in the  whole cast is Freddie Bartholomew, who often comes across as a whiney twit.  I'm sure Fields would have liked to have given him a kick in the pants,  like he did Baby LeRoy in The Old-Fashioned Way.
I recommend the film  heartily for young and old. You will certainly recognize the same virtues  and vices in people you see today. Unfortunately, good and evil nowadays  don't always result in the same outcomes as in Charles Dicken's  time.
When you've finished this film, move on to Great Expectations with  Alec Guiness, Jean Simmons and John Mills; Oliver Twist with Alec Guiness,  Robert Newton and Anthony Newley and A Christmas Carol with Alastair Sim.  If you aren't dripping with good will and cheer by then, let's face it  you're either dead or Scrooged.
Happy Holidays!",944179200,29,1573,4.845864661654136
386627,5,6301967801,Classic.  One of the best films ever made based on a Dickens' novel.  WC Fields and Freddie Bartholomew have perfect chemistry and all other supporting actors are marvelous.  Highly recommended.,1480032000,,194,5.4

386629,4,6301967801,"After just listening to the audio book, I bought this version of the movie.  I had warm memories of seeing it in a theater with my Mother as a child.
  First, the quality is outstanding which wa a nice surprise.  As far as the movie itself, when I read the reviews, a number of people did not care for this version and felt it was overly dramatic and that the PBS version with Daniel Radcliffe was better.  I thought that was probably a generational thing, but I have to agree with those reviewers.  Even though I had a mad crush on Freddie Bartholomew as a child, as an old woman, this movie made me smile, but was a bit too much.  It was a treat seeing all the old actors I loved but, if your buying this for your children or just want a well acted version, I would go with the PBS one.",1478736000,2,788,4.077922077922078

386636,3,6301967801,"I saw for the first time this Academy Award nominated version of David Copperfield and thought it was reasonably well done.  But the point of this review is to recommend to readers the Bob Hoskins, Maggie Smith, and Daniel Radcliffe version filmed by the BBC in 2006.  In every way it is the superior filming of this great story.

Yes, Freddie Bartholomew is good as David, but Daniel Radcliffe is great.  He brings out the strength of character young David must have had to survive first the Murdstones and then the blacking factory in London.  Next is Bob Hoskins as Micawber -- just the right amount of pomp and circumstance and perfectly believable as a person capable of upending the evil Uriah Heap.  In contrast, W.C. Fields is simply over the top -- all bombast and no depth.  We don't for a minute think he can best the clever Heap.  Next, of course, is the incomparable Maggie Smith as aunt Betsey Trotwood.  She gives the definitive performance of this irascible and indomitable old lady.  Nothing wrong with Edna May Oliver; in fact, I think she gives the best performance in the film.  Certainly, her role is expanded and takes on great significance in the story.

Last, but certainly not least, the Radcliffe version of Copperfield is an expanded treatment of the material with four episodes.  To do justice to the novel, we need this extra time.  Just to give one example, we meet Steerforth in the Freddie Bartholomew version only briefly, yet he has a most important role to play in the story.  In the Radcliffe version Steerforth is fleshed out and his family life is included for us to understand better who he is and why his character is flawed.  More screen time and better actors make the 2006 version the one to see.

Those readers of this review who like the film will probably love the great novel on which it is based.  I have read it three times and if I am lucky, I will read it a fourth time.  Each new reading brings great pleasure and new insight to Dickens genius; he is, after all, one of the greatest of English novelists.  David Copperfield was Dickens' favorite child and he is my best friend as a character in a novel.",1455321600,,2155,4.5625
386657,5,6301967801,"I have a huge collection of vintage films on DVD, but this one is really special. Funny to see this in writing because I was never much a fan of thirties moppet Freddy Bartholomew who plays David, but this is a clever condensation of Dickens' novel which tells the story of a somewhat stoic boy who has to make his way in the world after the death of his mother. The casting and the script is just wonderful. W.C. Fields, Edna Mae Oliver, Lionel Barrymore, Basil Rathbone, Jessie Ralph are among the stars who support young Freddie in this coming of age story. Unless you watch old movies a lot, you may not be familiar with some or any of the supporting players. However. I guarantee that you will be in for a treat. This is a fairly clean black and white print that moves along very quickly. It is constructed in an easy to follow way that adapts easily to the necessary age progressions and every character is special/memorable regardless of their role. This is a great investment for anyone who loves old movies.",1454112000,,1016,4.4972972972972975

And this film does it justice on many levels.  First and foremost, WC Fields excels in his role.  His elocution and delivery has never been excelled by anyone in Hollywood.  He was born to play characters from Dickens, and it's a shame we never saw him in Shakespeare, where he would have blown us away.  Certainly a worthwhile movie to watch for any fan of Dickens or Fields.  The downside is that the movie is so short.  Just wish there was more of it!",1437436800,2,606,4.445454545454545

It is a joy to watch and is one of the greatest movies ever made.  To say this movie has an all star cast is an understatement. W.C.

The pivotal scene where she confronts Mr Murdstone over his mistreatment of David is among the best five minutes of film ever recorded. The only slight weak link is Frank Lawton as the adult David, who is a little insipid; but the film, like the book is most compelling when recording David's eventful childhood.

386769,5,6301967801,"Although the movie was necessarily condensed and some characters were either eliminated or combined with others, the movie was still able to convey the charm and quaintness of the book.",1353888000,2,185,5.2
386770,5,6301967801,"This is a film classic on a large scale.  You may expect that when George Cukor is the director. and the producer is David O. Selznick of ""Gone with the Wind"" fame.  This was a time when the Hollywood studios controlled the actors and built up a vast stable of talent.  MGM studio enlisted some of its best for this movie.

The movie made Freddie Bartholomew a huge child film star. W.C. Fields is cast perfectly as Mr. Micawber, the deadbeat with a heart of gold whose opportunity for success is always just around the corner. Basil Rathbone does his usual great acting as Davy's cruel father-in-law, Mr. Murdstone. Lionel Barrymore is solid as the plain and beneficent old salt, Daniel Peggotty.  The supporting cast is also full of some of the greatest character actors in film.  Also included is a very young and beautiful Maureen O' Sullivan as Davy's wife, Dora.

Most who read this review know the story of Charles Dickens's greatest novel and do not need a retelling here. What they will be happy to know is how well the movie follows the novel, unlike so many other movies that do not.  Full of colorful characters, sharply drawn good and bad, and grand in its scale, parents and children can enjoy this youthful and innocent story of its time.  Not only is the novel a period piece of its time.  David Copperfield, the movie, is one of its time as well. This movie is well worth seeing, at any age, almost seventy years after its making, whether you have read the novel or not.",1337472000,2,1487,4.535580524344569

To portray any Dickens' novel in two hours and eleven minutes would be completely impossible so there were huge omissions one was the period when David attended school where he met Steerforth.  In the book Steerforth is completely self-centered, but befriends and protects David from harsh treatment while at school.  In the movie David merely says he met Steerforth at school.

 Anyone who reads the book after seeing this version will forever see and hear the characters as portrayed by W.C. Fields, Freddie Bartholomew, Edna May Oliver and the rest of the cast.  I treasure my copy and will watch it many times.",1319932800,2,746,4.78125

386776,5,6301967801,"""David Copperfield"" is practically a perfect film, even viewed more than three quarters of a century after it was made. It has the benefits of Dickens's story, an all star cast rarely matched in cinematic history, produced by David O Selznick (who a few years later gave us GWTW), directed by George Cukor (""Philadelphia Story"", ""Gaslight"", ""A Star is Born"", ""My Fair Lady""), with a musical score by Herbert Stothart (""Wizard of Oz"", ""Kismet"").

The 30s were the best of times for Dickens films, including ""Oliver Twist"" (1933) with Dickie Moore, ""Great Expectations"" (1934) with Henry Hull and Jane Wyatt, ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" (1935) with Claude Rains, ""Scrooge"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935) with Ronald Coleman, and ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938) with Reginald Owen.  No other decade would support so many adaptations. Selznick produced both ""David Copperfield"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and Herbert Stolhart did the music for both. The casts were different, although Edna May Oliver, Elizabeth Allen, and Basil Rathbone appeared in both. ""Great Expectations"" was produced at Universal with almost no overlap.

The all star cast includes Edna May Oliver (Aunt Betsy), Freddie Bartholomew (young David), Frank Lawton (adult David), Basil Rathbone (Mr. Murdstone), W.C. Fields (Mr. Micawber), Lionel Barrymore (Dan Peggoty), Elsa Lancaster (Clickett), Mildred Dunwick, Maureen O'Sullivan (Dora), and Lewis Stone (Mr. Wickfield). If you look closely you'll even see a young Arthur Treacher playing a thief.

The great Edna May Oliver is best remembered for her roles as The Red Queen in ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1933) and the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936). She was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Mrs. McKlennar in ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939)

Freddie Bartholomew plays young David. Freddie was one of the most famous child actors of the 1930s, appearing in ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" (1936), ""Captains Courageous"" (1937) and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). Freddie gives his usual endearing performance. This was his first American film. Louie Mayer had wanted child star Jackie Cooper to play the role, but Selznick argued for someone with a British accent.

No one has ever been better at playing the villain or the rouge than Basil Rathbone, and he is as hateful in this film as he is in any of his other performances, partially because his venom is directed against a little boy and his dull mother.  His performances in  ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Tower of London"" (1939), and ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940) are classic. He was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""If I Were King""). He's probably best remembered as the heroic Sherlock Holmes in the 14 films he made between 1939 and 1946.

Elizabeth Allen plays Agnes. Her beauty is haunting and her sincerity is heart-felt, as she was when she played  Lucy Manette in ""A Tale of Two Cities"". She made nearly 50 films in the UK and the US. She's not well known to US audiences because she returned to the UK after a contract dispute with MGM in 1938 - our loss.

The beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan is best remembered as Tarzan's Jane. She played Jane 6 times between 1932 and 1942, but she played many other roles during that time, including ""Tugboat Annie"" (1933), ""The Thin Man"" (1934), ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), ""A Yank at Oxford"" (1938), and ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1940). She slowed down in the 40s to devote time to her husband and 7 children, one of whom is the actress Mia Farrow. O'Sullivan plays the tragic Dora and does a terrific job.

BTW - Bartholomew, Rathbone, and O'Sullivan appeared in ""Anna Karenina"" the same year as they appeared in this film, also produced by David O Selznick.

Lionel Barrymore was probably the finest American actor of the first part of the 20th century, and second only to the Englishman Charles Laughton (who wife, Elsa Lancaster, appears in this film. BTW - Barrymore took over for Laughton who had to bow out).  Barrymore appeared in more than 200 films between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (""A Free Soul"" ) in 1931 Though he's probably best known as the evil banker in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare and the Dr. Gillespie films, he gave us many memorable performances -  as the innkeeper in ""Key Largo"" (1948), Thaddeus Stevens in ""Tennessee Johnson"" (1942), Grandpa in ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), and Billy Bones in ""Treasure Island"" (1934). Barrymore plays Dan Peggotty.

Lewis Stone plays Mr. Wickfield. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Patriot"" (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in ""The Big House"" (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), Commissioner Smith in ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932), and ""Doc"" in ""Three Godfathers"" (1936). He's probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46).

W.C. Fields was one of the greatest comedians in the first part of the 20th century, remembered and quoted to this day. He made 3 dozen films from 1915 to 1941 (""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"") and introduced such memorable characters as Ambrose Wolfinger and ""The Great McGonigle"". His casting as Mr. Micawber was brilliant, and Fields manages to keep his raucous humor under sufficient control to steal every scene he appears in. It's said that this was the only film in which Fields stuck to the script and avoided his usual string of ad libs. This he did because he admired Dickens' work.

Selznick is best remembered for ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), but he was nominated for 8 other Oscars for films as diverse as ""Viva Villa"" (1934),  ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1936), ""A Star is Born"" (1937), ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Spellbound"" (1945). Beyond these, he was also involved in one capacity or another in such classics as ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) and ""The Third Man"" (1949) among the nearly 90 films he produced.

George Cukor, the film's director, began his career on Broadway in 1917 and stayed there until 1929, when he moved to film and made more than 50 films from 1930 to 1981, including 5 Oscar nominations and one win (""My Fair Lady"" in 1964), a Lifetime Achievement Award from DGA, and an Emmy (""Love Among the Ruins"", 1975). In the 30s Cukopr was busy bringing classics to film, with ""Little Women"" (1933), ""Camille"" (1936), ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), ""Tom Sawyer"" (1938), ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), and ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939).

The 130 minute film was nominated for an Oscar as Best Picture, Best Editing (Robert Kern), and Best Assistant Director (Joseph Newman), but didn't win. The Best Picture for 1935 was ""Mutiny on the Bounty"".",1278547200,3,6817,4.85948275862069

I think Edna Mae Oliver is the best Aunt Betsey I've seen. She really gives Murdstone an earful, and doesn't put up with any nonsense.
This film holds up very well for something from the mid '30s. The costumes are very authentic, just what Dickens would have wanted, I feel. It's a very good film adaptation.",1252540800,2,474,4.654761904761905

386828,4,6301967801,"Let me preface this review by saying that most of the merit of this film comes from the fact that, like MGM's ""The Wizard of Oz"" it is a nice movie on its own, without complete adherence to the original story.  Many of the actors - particularly Edna Mae Oliver and W.C. Fields - put their own comical twists on the characters so that they are fresh but still recognizable as the people Dickens created.  I really enjoyed the film from beginning to end and I would certainly recommend it.

 However, I don't know if it can be called the ""definitive"" version of DC because it does take several liberties with the story - it is NOT the most book-accurate version of David Copperfield.  Though it was of course necessary to condense and combine the plots, the screenplay seemed at times a bit too merry, missing the darker themes Dickens included.  In addition, some important scenes were either cut entirely - like the experience at Salem House - or overly minimized, like the development of David's relationship with Agnes.  The film also suffered from a bit of bad acting from both the young and adult versions of David and a very lame Steerforth.

  Overall I will have to honestly say that you should not expect the accurate ""page-to-screen"" adaptation this movie is often called, but you should expect a very pleasurable, family-friendly, Dickens-inspired film that is nevertheless worth watching. :)",1245110400,2,1402,4.804166666666666

386833,5,6301967801,"Of all of the films directed by George Cukor, I think this is his finest achievement, helped in no small measure by the perfect casting of all the Dickens characters.

Freddie Bartholomew is flawless as the young David. Edna May Oliver as his stern but loving Aunt Betsy Trotwood gives her usual sharp characterization and nearly steals the first half of the movie. As for Mr. Murdstone, Basil Rathbone is the perfect embodiment of that brutally wicked man. Born to play Mr. Micawber is W. C. Fields, so uncannily right that it almost seems as if Dickens had him in mind when he wrote the character!

Very atmospheric, so much so that it seems almost incredible that an American movie company could have crafted this gem. One would think the British would have beat us to it--but Dickens would have approved of this version, I'm sure.

The only drawback is the length and the scenes involving David's wife, Dora, as played by Maureen O'Sullivan with a saccharine sweetness that becomes cloying at times. (Thank God she didn't play Melanie in 'GWTW'). Some of the acting is a bit florid but to be expected when you consider this was made in 1935. Roland Young is well cast as Uriah Heep.

Highly recommended. Anyone who cherishes the Dickens novel will not be disappointed. The only flaw is that the story has been compressed in order to limit the running time to two hours and ten minutes and it shows. All the essential characters remain but some of them have little dimension because of time constraints.",1196640000,4,1506,4.714828897338403
386834,3,6301967801,"David Copperfield is a book by Charles Dickens, so the themes of class struggles and broken family are prevalant here. This movie adaptation features a long cast list of famous classic stars including Elsa Lanchester, Lewis Stone, Madge Evans, and Una O'Connor among others.

David Copperfield (Freddie Bartholomew) is born without a father to a widowed mother who wants the best for her son. She soon falls in love again (Basil Rathbone), but when married finds that the man she picked is a tyrant. Unfortunately, she dies in childbirth, and David is left without a mother and without a home. He goes to a family of poor but happy people with a curmudgeon father figure (Lionel Barrymore) to hold them together. David also meets Micawber (W C Fields), a friendly but eccentric character who takes him in for a short time. When Micawber fails to make enough money to support the troupe, David is forced to seek his stuffy old aunt Betsey (Edna May Oliver) for assistance. Unexpectedly, she takes him in with open arms and educates him as part of society.

David grows up (Frank Lawton) and begins to visit with the people from his past in an attempt to repay them for their kindness. He fields trouble with the Wickfield family due to the sinister Uriah Heep (Roland Young). He also falls in love with a beautiful but childish Dora (Maureen O'Sullivan).

The film drags in places, and becomes too complex in others. Essentially, it is a series of vignettes of David's life. Somehow, despite the cast, the film does not gel the way it should to be a masterpiece that it had the potential to be.

Also included on the DVD are a few unrelated short subjects including a strange technicolor film about a drunken man who imagines the dummies in a department store are alive.",1191283200,4,1769,4.715210355987055

A box-office smash when it was released in 1935, ""Copperfield"" is eminently faithful to the spirit of the Victorian-era novel, tracing the hardships of Bartholomew's orphan hero as he bounces from home to home in search of a real family. Oliver, Rathbone, Maureen O'Sullivan, and Lionel Barrymore are all superb in their respective roles, while Fields musters up an unforgettably charming mix of eccentricity and warmth as Micawber, a role he seemed born to play.

386858,5,6301967801,"1939 has often been touted as the peak of Hollywood's Golden Era. While I would not argue with that (Ted Sennett wrote a whole book about it), 1935 was a Sterling year for American movies also. All the studios turned out fine films that year: ""The Little Colonel"" and ""The Littlest Rebel"" at 20th Century-Fox, ""Top Hat"" and ""The Informer"" at RKO, ""The Ruggles of Red Gap"" and ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" at Paramount, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" at Universal, ""The Whole Town's Talking"" at Columbia, ""Call of the Wild"" at United Artists, ""Gold Diggers of 1935"" and ""Captain Blood"" at Warner Brothers, and at MGM, ""A Night at the Opera"", ""Naughty Marietta"", ""Anna Karenina"", ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""David Copperfield"" (whew!)

David Copperfield is deservedly one of the outstanding pictures of 1935 or any other year! I definitely have to agree with Charles Dickens himself, when he said ""Of all my books, I like this the best"". And of all the Dickens' books adapted to the screen, I like this one the best, and I bet he would have been pleased, too.

The film has many pleasures: the outstanding cast (of whom Freddie Bartholomew as young David, Edna May Oliver as Aunt Betsy Trotwood, and W.C. Fields as Mr. Micawber, stand out), the well-written screenplay by Howard Estabrook and Hugh Walpole (why drag a story out for five or six hours and multiple parts, when you can tell it well in two or three hours?), the expert direction of George Cukor, and the period flavor.

But perhaps the reason it is SO good is the genius that was David O. Selznick. He pulled all the parts together to make a thoroughly satisfying whole with a brillent skill that would reach it peak four years later with ""Gone with the Wind"". The production has ""class"" stamped all over it, and this was due to Mr. Selznick. We will never see his like in Hollywood again. What a shame.

I highly recommend this film. The use of the English language (have your dictionary ready) by WC Field as Mr. Micawber is worth the price of DVD in and of itself. Buy it to-day! While I'm at it, you'd be wise to watch and/or buy most any movie produced by David O. Selznick (Google his name, you will find a list).

Actually there's no need to hear the ridiculous lines (no comparison with the book) that are in this script. A nice soundtrack instead of all the babbling would have made a great difference. Why? Because the faces tell it all. Mind you that George Cukor was a great director, only this one wasn't his best work.

Carries you back in time to England of the 1800's, for the struggles of a young boy over mean people and poverty. Later in the film we see the boy grown up, seeking romance, and battling another scoundrel.

This good 1935 film shows the lost art of character acting; meaning the colorful characters come alive with lots of charm and personality. For example, you really dislike the bad guys. You are never unsure about any of the characters. The characters display a lot of personality, with depth, in a short space of time. This happens not only by good acting, directing, and script, but depends upon great casting to fit each part perfectly. A good character actor can portray say, the bad guy, and you know he is the bad guy instantly even before he speaks, and you see his bad traits beyond the black hat, meaning you can tell why he is a bad guy. Good casting is more than just good guys and bad guys, as Edna Mae Oliver shows playing the bossy aunt with a kind heart. While, I did not like WC Fields in his other films, here he is well cast as a bum, who surprisingly, gains some soul.

The 2000 version of ""David Copperfield"" with child actor Daniel Radcliffe of ""Harry Potter"" fame is the best version. I saw this 1935 version first and enjoyed it very much. However, the 2000 version has more of everything, more humor, better script, more sinister bad guys, more depth, is 50 minutes longer, and has excellent character acting as well.

The print on display here is in pretty wretched condition, with a plethora of marks, scratches and other blemishes on almost every frame. True, this is a 70 year old film, and one must make allowances - but if the original negative WAS available, then much could have been done to minimise the damage of time and restore the image.

I think that Warners didn't want to spend the money, which may explain why the DVD slipcase makes no mention of digital remastering or original negatives at all...!

386864,5,6301967801,"There are so many adaptations of Charles Dickens, but many of them in and after the 1950s are actually made for television like BBC mini-series. The golden era of the Dickens FILMs was the 1930s and 40s, when David Lean's `Great Expectations' and `Oliver Twist' were produced in England. Before these classics, however, Hollywood also made two great films based on Dickens in the same year from the same studio: MGM's 1935 version of `Tale of Two Cities' and `David Copperfield.'

George Cukor's `David Copperfield' respectfully treats the immortal characters Dickens created. The original's plot was never changed drastically, and you still feel that this is a Hollywood film - Hollywood in the 1930s when the name of producer David O. Selznick appears on the screen AFTER the director's name. Then the film shows a book cover, and someone slowly turns over the page. No one makes films like this today

The film starts with the delightful turn of Edna May Oliver as Aunt Betsy Trotwood, one of the juiciest roles in this film, and she never disappoints us. Beautiful Elizabeth Allan (then on contract to MGM, also seen in `Tale of Two Cities') effectively plays the young mother of David, too young and maybe foolish. Basil Rathbone as chilling Murdstone makes a great contrast with her sunny personality that is destroyed by his cold heart.

Cukor's `David Copperfield' is usually associated with W. C. Fields's Mr. Micawber, which is surely convincing and funny without overacting, but as I have pointed out, there are so many good actors besides Fields (who actually replaced Charles Laughton after the shooting had started). MGM's studio system sometimes damaged the career of the talented actors such as Buster Keaton who was often miscast during his MGM era, but as far as `David Copperfield' is concerned, every player is put in right place. Watch angelic Maureen O'Sullivan as the endearing and doomed heroine Dora, and you know what I mean. Well, I want more Lionel Barrymore and Elisa Lanchester, but I admit the film is near perfect.

Of course nobody is perfect, and so is George Cukor. No matter how he tries, the film's location never looks authentic, and at one scene an obviously painted backdrop stands for the city of London. By today's standard this is unacceptable, but as I said, no one makes films like this today. Enjoy the world of Dickens, and Hollywood when it was making real Hollywood films.",1160092800,32,2421,4.926470588235294
386865,3,6301967801,"If the BBC can devote 26 episodes to the Forsyte Saga (an excellent movie), surely they can devote 12 episodes to the greatest novel in the English language.  Or to put it another way, if the BBC can devote five hours to an inferior novel like ""The Buccaneers"", surely they can devote twice that number to David Copperfield.

The 1974 version of the book is 5 hours long, the longest version so far.  It includes all the important events of the novel, but only touches on these events and the many characters and does not have time to make the events as effective as they could be.  The script is creditable except a few times where they ducked a dramatic scene, breaking before and coming in afterward, including the scene which Tolstoy called the greatest in all of world literature--the storm at sea.  It is also a low budget film.

The casting is inferior with weak performances of almost all the actors (the exceptions being Anthony Andrews as Steerforth, the actress who played Aunt Betsy and the actor who played Heap, who gave us the best Uriah of any of the movie versions).  Outstanding examples of bad casting were (1) David's mother, who should have been young and dainty instead of 40 and rugged, and (2) Dora, who should have been 16 and petite instead of late 30s and tall and sturdy.  Also, the actor played Macawber too seriously without the touch of comic absurdity which the book has and which the part required.  The actor who played the grown-up David did not look half so bad as the picture on the cover and played his part adequately.

The 1935 version with its stark black and white resembles the Cruikshank drawings in the book, and many of the performances are definitive: Freddy Bartholomew as young David, Edna Mae Oliver as Aunt Betsy, Basil Rathbone as Murdstone, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Peggoty, as well as the people who played David's mother, little Emily, and most but not all of the minor characters.  The scenery is a joke, cardboard sets, painted backdrops and the desert landscape of California are offered as the English countryside.  Still, this is an effective and indelible movie, marred only by having to leave so much out (2 hours 10 minutes) and by the horrendously inappropriate casting of W.C. Fields as Macawber (the most laconic actor in the movies to play the most loquacious character in all literature?!)  His laboring to get the words out is painful to watch.  The director, George Cukor, wanted Charles Laughton.  Louis B. Mayer overruled him.  But the filmmaker knew how to make movies, and the screenwriter knew how to write screenplays.  The same cannot be said for the other film versions.

The 1970 version is a joke.  Some smart-aleck screenwriter thought it would be clever to chop the story up into bits, toss them in the air, pick them up randomly and show them to the audience.  All the moving events are thus rendered totally ineffective.  This version is useful only as a lesson in how to ruin a great story.

The 1999 version is only three hours long and has more elaborate sets, some location shooting, and background music, but suffers from poor or inappropriate casting.  Maggie Smith chose to play Aunt Betsy as a straight serious role, depriving the character of the comic touches which make Aunt Betsy such a cherished character.  Bob Hoskins' performance bears no relation to Macawber, thus depriving us of one of the most colorful characters in all literature.  Incredibly, the actor chosen to play Murdstone looks almost identical to Hoskins!  Imelda Staunton portrays Mrs. Macawber very well, and the boy does well enough as young David, but the rest of the cast is lamentable.  And the omission of Traddles is a loss.  The script is hit and miss.  But the most serious problems are the introduction of a narrator who is constantly narrating and keeping the audience at one remove from the events, and the actor who play the grown-up David who constantly smiled and smirked, sometimes even in the tragic scenes.  He seemed to have no other facial expression.

Bottom line: If you can only afford one version, the 1974 version is your best bet.  Alas.",1158278400,7,4127,4.752808988764045

386901,5,6301967801,"One of the major problems that any Hollywood director faces in transferring Dickens from the printed page is selectively deleting extraneous plot and character so that Dicken's original vision can be encompassed within a two hour time frame.  In DAVID COPPERFIELD, director George Cuckor succeeds admirably in catching the flavor of a vast panorama of characters and subplots without losing Dickens' sense of horror at the then widespread brutalization of children.  The result was a richly deserved nomination for Best Picture of 1935
  David is played in the first half by Freddie Bartholemew, and in the second by Frank Lawton.  David is a sweet, unassuming boy who loves his doting mother to the point that the audience early can guess that his happiness is soon to be blighted by nasty adults, the most insidious of whom is Mr. Murdstone, whose rapid sense of diction is matched only by his ability to use that diction as a precursor to pummeling David.  David is thoroughly traumatized by Murdstone's sadistic comments such as, ""David, do you know how I break a horse?  I beat him.""  And all the while the audience is screaming for his mother to intervene and throw out this bum of a husband.  But she does not, and David's debasement continues until her death when Murdstone inherits her property and banishes David to live with distant relatives.  In many of Dickens' novels, he portrays women as falling into one of two categories: the sweet but essentially helpless women who are no more able to control their lives than a young David is able to control his.  His mother and Dora (Maureen O'Sullivan) whom he later marries are typical.  The other kind of woman is the rompin stompin in your face female played by Edna May Oliver, who steals the movie as Aunt Betsy, who stands as a rock of refuge for the tormented David.  It is she who drives away the hated Murdstone, who comes to reclaim the runaway David.
The first half of the movie is far more of interest than the second.  It is almost as if Dickens used up most of his creative juices in delineating the character of a David whose youthful helplessness far exceeds the interest generated by Frank Lawton, who plays David more as wimpish Phillip Carey from OF HUMAN BONDAGE than the introverted but tormented Heathcliffe from WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  The second half drags as David attempts to sort out the women in his life.  He marries the child-woman Dora, only to rage against a childishness that he should have spotted long before their marriage.  Equally unbelievable is his one-sided relation with Agnes (Madge Evans), who somehow falls in love with the articulate but socially fumbling David.  Both halves of the movie are carried by the extraordinary talents of the supporting cast.  Edna May Oliver's loud voice and broomstrokes mark her as a stalwart defender of youthful innocence.  W. C. Fields as Micawber adds comedy and pathos in a gravely base voice as only he can. Roland Young makes the most of his screen time as the weasily and slimy Uriah Heap whose 'Umbleness' tagline stamps him as yet another unforgettable Dickens creation.  By movie's end, the audience can see that Dickens did not believe in the fairy tale happy ending.  Sometimes the bad guys (like Murdstone) got away with their villainy.  And sometimes (like Heep) they did not.  The Dickens of both book and screen both agree that life is most often a gamble, but if one has true grit and a loud protective female presence somewhere in the background, then all might turn out well.  Sort of like real life.",1033257600,16,3551,4.800986842105263
386902,5,6301967801,"Dickens, with his vast humanity and that amazing vitality of his which created a whole world of characters, contains inexhaustable riches for the screen, though his long rambling plots are the despair of scenerio writers.  His people--types, caricatures, or whatever you choose to call them--are distict and individual in appearance, actions and speech--and are rare parts for good actors.  The trick in getting Dickens effectively on the screen was an enormously difficult one of selecting and condensing--keeping enough to satisfy the Dickens lover who complains bitterly when any favourite character or episode is left out.  Some may find Dickens as being overlong, overly sentimental and often more than a bit tedious; at any rate, however, this is excellent Dickens!  Good intentions and imposing ambitions are plentiful enough in the making of movies, but woefully rare are the instances where technical excellence, good taste and judgement and an intelligent sense of the rightness of things combined to bring thowe intentions and ambitions to a successful issue.  DAVID COPPERFIELD is one of those rare and happy successes.  It met every reasonable expectation competently and generously, and the film was highly praised by the critics and public alike back in 1935.  This filmed version of the classic novel by Dickens, is remarkably faithful to the source - rich in atmosphere and fine characterisations.  David himself is played ideally by both Freddie Bartholomew and Frank Lawton; they miraculously seem to be the same person at different ages!  If Frank Lawton seems less interesting, its only because his adventures are so mild compared  with those of Bartholomew.  W.C. Fields' whole career seemed to have been a preparation for his role as Micawber; he is magnificent in his off-beat role.  Edna May Oliver and Jessie Ralph give flawless pictures of Betsey Trotwood and Peggotty.  The black villainy of the Murstones is done in just the right spirit by Basil Rathbone and Violet Kembell Cooper while Roland Young makes you actually feel the dampness of Uriah Heap's hands!

Freddie turns in an excellent young David, and it's a pity that the adult David is such an unremarkable figure. That's one reason, I think, why Roland Young's Uriah Heep and Maureen O'Sullavan's Dora are so impressed upon viewers' memories in the later scenes : they have no competition from a strong lead. Still, the first half of this movie is really what carries it, and what everyone thinks of when they conjure up images from the film. Selznick and Cukor did an admirable job of selecting a cast as idiosyncratic as Dickens' creations have to be: WC Fields' ever-hopeful bankrupt Mr. Micawber, Basil Rathbone's sneering stepfather Mr. Murdstone, Edna May Oliver's totally absurd Aunt Betsey Trotwood.  It's true, of course, that much of the novel had to be deleted in order to make the movie an acceptable theatrical running time, but the cutting is done well so that the audience does not sense that something is missing from the storyline.

Freddie Bartholomew stars as the title character, a young boy eventually orphaned who meets a host of characters as he grows up alone.  Although Bartholomew was actually one of the better child actors in film history, he never captures this character and his performance sometimes seems forced and ineffective.  However, he is surrounded by an incredible group of actors playing memorable supporting characters. Basil Rathbone, W.C. Fields, Edna May Oliver, and Roland Young are all excellent in roles that only Dickens could have written.  They make the movie.  The film features the usual MGM production values and is well worth a look.",989625600,5,870,5.134751773049645
386905,4,6301967801,"For those of you who read my review on the book, you know that I gave it 5 stars. Now overall, these people did a great job of fitting an 870 page book into 2 hours. To be sure, some significant characters like Traddles are deleted, and some characters like Steerforth are glossed over. But most of the major characters like David, Murderstone, Uriah Heep, and Mr. Micawber are well done. Edna May Oliver is over the top as David's slightly eccentric but benevolent aunt. Dora (the eternal child) is done well. The comical and tragic first marriage of David is done very well. The scenery is simple but well done. Micawber could have been a little more animated in his comical rage against 'HEEP,' but he does fine. Some charming extras in this video are that a page from the book ""David Copperfield"" is filmed in. This filmed in page allows us to see that we are watching what Charles Dickens felt to be his ('favorite child') best creation. Also at times, David even looks like Charles Dickens! I think it is best to watch this video after you have read the book. That way your memory can fill in the deleted or abridged events. (Steerforth's friendship with David before abducting Emily, David's aunt losing her property and having to move in with him, etc.) Even if you have already read the book, you will not want to miss this charming production.",985910400,5,1353,4.57201646090535

It also shows in some respect how people were treated in different parts of the world without being ""sugar coated"" as nothing is anymore.
