4864685,1,B005S9EHL6,"Whereas the original HUMAN CENTIPEDE had a mere three unfortunates joined together at their rectums, this smash sequel ups the ante -- or is that centi-ante? -- by nine for an even dozen and succeeds in making an ass out of everyone involved, most of all the ""filmmakers.""",1317945600,4,272,4.6875
4864686,2,B005S9EHL6,"*THIS DOES CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS*

The Human Centipede was fairly underwhelming. It wasn't terrible and it wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't this monstrously absurd and gory movie you may have expected from the concept and promotional materials. The concept itself was probably the most disturbing and interesting aspect of the movie. Imagining yourself in that situation was more horrific than anything that made it on-screen. It didn't even feel like people had enough time to fully process the first film before writer/director Tom Six began hyping the second film in a proposed trilogy. The sequel was then banned in the UK (before the ban was lifted recently) and censored in the US, which probably only piqued curiosity even further. Tom Six has gone on record as saying The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) will make the original seem like ""My Little Pony"" in comparison, which is probably true due to its graphic nature. Unfortunately the sequel has little else to offer.

So before I go into too much detail, the screener I saw was apparently an edited version of the film. Maybe that means this is the one that will be distributed theatrically in the US, but I do know that the barbed wire bit didn't make it into the film and the ending was slightly altered.

We're introduced to Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), a security guard who has a rabid obsession with the original Human Centipede film. He does nothing but watch the movie over and over again and even has a scrapbook devoted to it along with re-drawn diagrams from the movie to pull off the centipede. Martin isn't normal; he was sexually abused as a child, likes mutilating himself, and still lives with his mother. While on the job, he kidnaps people, ties them up, and stores them in an abandoned storage unit with the hopes of making his passion a reality; a twelve person human centipede.

The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is entirely black and white. It does make the film stand out in comparison to its predecessor, but it also changes the appearance of gore rather dramatically. Tom Six defended this film after being banned in the UK by calling it ""make believe"" and called it ""art."" The black and white aspect of the film certainly makes it feel more artistic, but that term will probably come into question after you witness some of the things that take place on screen. Martin is very off-putting. He's extremely overweight, greasy all the time, and just really creepy overall. He has this Jonah Hill meets Wayne Knight at their worst type of look to him. Every close up, every action, every time he licks his fingers, basically everything Martin does grosses you out. Martin also never speaks throughout the movie. He wheezes, cries, and throws tantrums, so he's not completely silent. But those of you expecting another Dr. Heiter will be sorely disappointed.

It's not like this version of the film didn't completely shy away from gruesomeness though. There's still plenty in here to get offended over or get excited about. The sandpaper bit did make it in there, but I have a feeling it was edited as well. The pregnant woman in the car scene is pretty revolting. I had to rewind it and watch it again to make sure I saw it right. We see Martin dismantle about half a dozen kneecaps by cutting open the sides and snipping their tendons, Martin takes a hammer and knocks out every tooth in a man's mouth before fishing them out, and that same man rips his stapled lips off another man's anus. Those are just a few examples.

Martin's mother was unintentionally hilarious. She mostly just seems bitter and old when the movie first starts, but her bad acting eventually makes itself known. She also has a scene with Martin at the dinner table which leads to their second encounter with their upstairs neighbor that is probably the best scene in the sequel even though it only lasts a few seconds and is kind of ridiculous. The twelve person centipede gets really disgusting though. Once Martin gives everyone a laxative shot, then you can probably see where that is going to lead and it gets all over the camera multiple times. The ending is pretty weak, too. Did you ever play Super Mario Bros 2? Well that's pretty much the ending you get here. Online reports say that there's actually more to the ending featuring more footage, but the version I saw was literally credits of the movie, Martin sitting in the camera room at work, Martin licking his fingers, an outside shot where we see Martin through a window, end film. There may have been a baby crying the background, I don't recall. But with that version of the ending, it's difficult to argue that it all wasn't just a dream.

I'm not going to tell you to not see The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence). If you enjoyed the first film or if your interest has heightened due to its hype, then curiosity will cause you to see this in some way or another. Hell, I'd at least like to know what was cut and I'd probably watch it again if I knew it was unrated, the director's cut, an alternate version, etc. But the sequel is a bit disappointing. Sure, the blood and graphic content of the sequel is increased tenfold but Martin isn't nearly as captivating as Dr. Heiter and everything just feels like it's for nothing by the time the ending rolls around. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) just leaves you with bloody discharge on your face without much of anything to show for it. Demented, disgusting, and rather pointless, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is more than likely the extremely nauseating film you expected the first film to be.",1317859200,13,5593,4.695208970438328

4864745,1,B005S9EHL6,"My first thought when gearing about these movies was that it must be about some mad scientist who wants to genetically engineer a human centipede. Never in a million years would I have imagined the sick depravity that this movie was actually about. Only a very disturbed person could have came come up with such is a disgusting premise for a movie. And even more sick is that is was made into a movie, actors actually wanted to be in it, and people actually watch it. The desensitization and demoralization of humanity continues to reach an all time high.

I unfortunately saw this movie being discussed on social media and decided to look it up online. As I watched the clip, my brain almost couldn't comprehend what I was watching. I felt a horrible feeling of disgust and felt sick to my stomach. I lost my appetite for the rest of the day and felt like I had been traumatized. The images of this movie will now be in my head forever. And to think that this movie is readily available streaming online for pretty much anyone to see. This movie contains scenes of child abuse, child rape, rape with a barb wire, a baby's head being smashed in, teeth being knocked out, oh and just people having diarrhea in each other's mouths with no escape. This movie should have never been made. If you have even a little tiny bit of decency or empathy for other human beings this movie will make you feel sick. I have seen a lot of violent horror movies, and although they are violent they have an actual point. There is a protagonist that overtakes the bad guy, or there is some sort of redeeming point to the movie. They also don't generally involve people being forced to eat feces. This movie has no purpose other than to shock and disgust, and dare I say even desensitize people to these disgusting acts. I can only imagine that Tom Six has some serious issues and a lack of empathy. He is probably proud of people's disgust with this movie, and that says it all.",1462147200,4,1958,4.454038997214485

4864816,3,B005S9EHL6,"""The Human Centipede II"" (2010) is directed by Tom Six. This film is a sequel to the 2009 film, and it seems a lot more accomplished and unified than the first film. This movie tells the story of an admirer of the first film who decides to make his own human centipede. This film has a sort of David Lynch feel about it with strong moody environmental sounds and odd characters, including a psychiatrist and his mother. One scene with the three of them in their living room reminded me somewhat of a sequence in Eraserhead where Spencer met his girlfriend's parents, where everybody just seems a bit off, and not saying much. Like Eraserhead this film was also shot in black and white. Martin doesn't speak much and so comes across as a bit slow and out of touch with the world around him. We view him as an overweight psychotic doughboy. When eventually Martin has collected enough people to begin creating his own centipede this is where things begin to go wrong for him since he is not a surgeon and he has no skills of that sort. All that he knows comes from watching the mad surgeon from the first film. The child-like drawings that he uses as reference material are the full extent of his ""in depth"" training: ""connecting the mouth of one person to the anus of the other to create one continuous digestive system"". Of course, what does one do with one giant human centipede? This seems to be where Martin comes to an impasse, and so does the movie. When you see them inching around a room on their knees he probably realizes this won't make a great circus act. It's black, it's absurd, but it's also amusing.",1443225600,2,1614,4.47457627118644

4864855,4,B005S9EHL6,"Ahh... The Human Centipede [First Sequence] (2010)
Tom Sixs debut went straight for the jugular and as a result seemed to spark the level of controversy and dismissive hyperbole most commonly reserved for people mutilating small furry animals.
Three years after its initial release it seems I belong to the minority, who believed that Tom Sixs original stab at the centipede was a work of pure brilliance, as a result I was more than a little excited, not to mention anxious to see where he might take the story next.
So without further ado, lets take a closer look at the second chapter, shall we?

Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is an obese reclusive loner, who lives with his nagging mother (Vivien Bridson) in a ramshackle apartment building in a bleak and poverty striking London neighbourhood. He works as a night watchman at a parking garage, a job that affords him plenty of time to indulge his obsession with Tom Sixs film The Human Centipede which he watches on a continues loop on his laptop while tending to his scrapbook, filled with pictures and memorabilia from the movie, including an painstakingly detailed operation chart depicting the ass-to-mouth surgery, performed by the movies mad scientist Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser)
Pushed to the brink of his already frail sense of sanity by noisy and intrusive neighbours and his perpetually exasperating mother, Martin hatches a plan to outdo his fictional idol by creating his own centipede. Soon a wide assortment of unwilling participants lie naked and battered on the concrete floor of a dilapidated warehouse as Martin commence with his fiendish plan.
Armed with duct tape, household tools, a staple gun, razor wire and a large supply of laxative, Martin is determent to fabricated the most majestic of beings; A twelve part centipede.

Part dux in the ongoing centipede-saga takes the Meta approach, which some reviews have sniffed at as a smug and pretentious move away from the established narrative, a matter of opinion I guess, personally I found the entire notion of breaking the fourth wall refreshing and quite bold for a genre film as sleazy and detestable as this one, when quite frankly the easiest thing to do would have been to simply continue onwards with the established and expected, given that it worked a charm the first time round. It clearly shows that theres some sort of intellect and out of the box mentality (albeit a highly depraved of sorts) present in driving the series forward, which ultimately leaves me all the more curious as to where the planned third chapter might take us.

As is most common, the main reason people tend to tread these murky roads of discomfort seems to be that they offer the viewer a chance to test their boundaries while they emerge themselves in the pervasive exploits of utter degradation that these types of films have to offer. Well, let me tell you (if you haven't already been brought up to speed) that The Human Centipede II [Full Sequence] fully lives up to and dare I say might even surpass the expectation of even the most hardened/tested gore-hounds out there.
The film offers up a glorious parade of atrocities including rape, mutilation, a messy delivery of a newborn and more fecal matter then even De Sade would care to be associated with (check out the sly dig at Steven Spielbergs Schindlers List, no points for guessing what element have been colour corrected here)
For short its a s*** smeared love letter to the art-form of Grand Guignol and if you should find yourself wishing for an even more offensive and cruel piece of moviemaking, then might I suggest a little thing called psychotherapy instead?

Anecdote time: I opted to give this film a viewing on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. Thats right. In the midst of holiday carolling and a parade of plumb sugary treats, my brother-in-law (a fellow deviant) and I snug down to one of the unoccupied bedrooms in my parents abode to try and counterbalance all the too-all-a-good-night sentimentality with a wee dose of unbridled perversion. An hour and a half later we were positively craving the warmth and cuddly fell of yuletide ambience.
Unfortunately we weren't the only ones affected by the visuals of Sixs film as my unsuspecting Father caught a glimpse of the atrocities while passing the window and was left utterly mortified.
Let me tell you... Its more than a little difficult defending film as an art form when the centipede is the subject of discussion.

Technical speaking, the film represent an immaculate standard, outside A Serbian Film (Srpski Film, Srdjan Spasojevic, 2010) I cant remember a film this extreme looking so professional.
The Cinematography is expertly done by David Meadows whose black and white imagery brings to mind the nightmarish qualities of David Lynchs Eraserhead (1977).
Much like Dieter Laser in the first film, Laurence R. Harvey represents a real find as the blubbery, perspirering mass that is Martin, a tragic and largely pathetic creature thats perfectly in sync with the films freak-show antics and while he never utters a word, his bulging eyes and childlike demeanour is never-the-less wholeheartedly effective.
Last but certainly not least, I want to mention the spectacular job done by the make-up effects team, unpleasantries seldom looked as convincing or dear I say good as this.
Its quite clear that the filmmakers didn't intended for the film to be taken all that seriously but this approach also renders it fairly inconsequential, which begs the question; why should the audience even get involved?
Ultimately its pure unbridled exploitation which means it deliberately shallow and primarily designed to titillated. Whether or not you want it as rough as this is primarily a matter of taste (or lack off).",1435449600,8,5752,4.968847352024922

4865120,5,B005S9EHL6,"I saw the second movie, and was profoundly moved. Essentially, it's all a weird and lazy mental fantasy that Martin Lomax is having inside his head. What becomes psychologically poignant about the tale is the mentality of such a physically repulsive pariah, the squalor and disadvantaged conditions of his existence, and the forlorn and utterly bleak redundancy of his destined future. Nothing seems left to him but squalid leisure in a rigid monotony. So he indulges in a capricious maiming of victims through all the morbid desires of those other influences around him, allowing himself the luxury of random sadism.

What he does is atrocious, but no less so than how he's treated by society at large. What he does is monstrous and vicious, but no less so than how he perceives his entire history to have been. What he does in his brain is no less than the spontaneous fantasies each and every one of us seek surcease to when found in times of frustration, and should never be regarded as anything more than idle ruminations. There should be no better means of trying to dive into the mind of any serial killer to determine the motive of their psychopathy  than this stark glimpse of hardened reality as revenge fantasy.",1409875200,,1222,4.786729857819905

Aside from the shock value of coprophagia, and the pointless violence the characters inflict on each other, I'm convinced that virtually the entire sequence is merely a fantasy taking place in the protagonist's mind. My reasons are:

We learn at the beginning that the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Centipede/dp/B004KAQV2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Centipede</a>&nbsp;film is only a film in the context of the second one. This foreshadows the conclusion that the second one is not real, either.

Martin seems to operate in a world with no police, and few other people besides his oppressors and the people he torments. No one bothers to check up on the growing number of missing people, or what surely must have been noisy gunshots in an urban area.

No one notices the baby left in the car, in the middle of a driving lane in the parking structure, and it appears to suffer no ill effects after what must be several days with no food or water. The victims in the warehouse, despite being shot, clubbed about the head with a tire iron, and also left alone for days without food or water, are all still alive when Martin starts to connect them. At the same time, none of them escape or even change position, despite only being bound and gagged by duct tape. After he cuts the victims' knees and connects everyone together, despite being in what must be agonizing pain, they all cooperatively rise up on all fours and progress around the room for Martin's amusement, without any apparent effort on his part to make them do this. Implausibly, Martin happens to have a bottle of injectable laxative conveniently available.

Ashlynn Yennie flies to London by herself, under the impression that she is auditioning for the new Quentin Tarantino movie. How Martin arranged this is a mystery - did he forge Tarantino's studio letterhead? Is he more articulate than he appears? Surely very extensive and complex arrangements are made for this sort of thing.

At the end, Martin is cleaned up and back at work, watching his favorite movie again, with no apparent consequences from leaving the baby in the car and the body of his therapist in the garage only a few feet away, not to mention the many missing people in the warehouse, including the landlord. The therapist, by the way, shows up at a very convenient time, and doesn't display the expected reaction when Martin shoots the other man right in front of him.

The point may be that in our world, the events in this film are ""just a movie."" It's an irrelevant point, because we are still watching the same images, whether they are in the ""real world"" of the film, or the protagonist's imagination. One can only imagine the next film in the series, which is supposed to make the first two look like Ozzie and Harriet in comparison.",1402704000,4,2949,4.911646586345381

Because of his obsession he decides to start kidnapping people in order to create his own human centipede.  At first I felt that the actor portraying the crazed fan was perfect for the part.  He was weird and creepy looking.  But that only lasted so long, as the man could barely move.  It made the whole scenario seem extremely implausible.  I mean how was he supposed to carry all of those people, some almost as big as him, when he could barely bend over.  Then, after all of the victims were captured, while only being restrained by rope, all of the victims just laid on the ground and waited for the sicko to tap them on the head with a wrench, which instantly knocked them out.  I know if I was in that room, Id be flailing all around trying to break loose, or at the minimum trying to dodge the blows.  Poor job in those regards.  To me this movie just seemed like a ploy to capitalize on the success of the first movieand failed in the process.  Where there was actually somewhat of a plot in the first movie, this one was simply all about the gore, and seemed as if it was just trying to outdo the first film.  I will be hesitant to watch the third oneif one comes out.

4865210,1,B005S9EHL6,"There have been plenty of reviews on this movie, so I really don't think I need to add an additional opinion.  I basically just want to say this about it.

The ONLY thing I like about this movie, is the plot.  According to ""Part 2: Full Sequence"", the original Human Centipede was a movie and not something that ""really"" happened (not that many movies really happen, but I think you understand what I mean).  So there is a guy, who is obsessed with the ""movie"" of Human Centipede, and he decides that he wants to do this for real to some people, that is the plot of Part 2.

The idea of that was actually rather brilliant (coming up with a plot like that) because sometimes certain movies struggle with ideas of how to create sequels, like some ""B"" movies about things like Killer Snowmen, Killer Turkey's, or anything else you can imagine.  So I actually thought the movie had promise with the plot, but it was basically senseless and an attempt to disgust the audience as much as they could without a point.

I also thought it was interesting how one of the girls who was an ""actress"" in the original Movie, was talking about what it was like making the movie while being unaware of just what was in store for her while being driven to the warehouse.

All I have to say is that I am thankful that this movie (in addition to the original) is available for streaming as I would not want to have bought the DVD of a movie like this.

Having said all of that, will I watch Part 3, that we all know is coming, actually...Yes, I will.  Why?  Because I heard some good people are going to be cast and maybe the 3rd attempt will give the movie a better storyline and something that isn't just all out gore.

Thus, if you enjoyed the first, then this sequel is actually pretty good. Martin, (Laurence Harvey, in one of the most horrifically challenging, but superbly-acted roles ever undertaken in the horror genre), is a London car-park attendant. A short, fat, grotesque figure of a man, with no friends, and one very screwed-up family. Living in his squalid flat, with his unhinged mother, who loathes every fibre of his being, and with regular visits from his doctor/psychologist who seems to have an unnerving ""interest"" in him, he sleeps, eats and works, with almost nothing fulfilling in his existance.

...With one exception. His decidely extreme interest in the film THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE. Rewatching it, several times a night, every night, to pass the time at work, he hatches a plan to create his own 12-person centipede, for real.

During his job, he comes across many people who society probably wouldn't miss: prostitutes, thugs, angry lovers, taxi drivers, and thus his plan begins. Shooting, maiming and kidnapping his victims, he carts them off to a large storage unit/warehouse, where he starts to turn his fantasties into actually reality... with decidedly demented results.

You can't watch something like this, and then try to take a moral high ground about it being offensive, degrading or morally dubious. You're watching a film about a man who kidnaps, tortures and brutalises 12 human beings, before he sews them together, mouth-to-anus, and defiling them. If you want to talk about morals, then go watch SESAME STREET! As such, you have to take the film as you find it. This is a film that revels in excess. Whilst not the most offensive horror film in recent years, it's certainly in the Top 10, and you can see why the British Board Of Film Classification (BBFC) and many other censorship agencies around the globe cut or banned this film. Thankfully, here, we get the uncut, uncensored version, in full 1080p, and it's a truly beautiful film to view.

The monochrome photography is sublime. Apart from a couple of moments, the monochromatic imagery is stark, shocking and a feast for the eyes. There is real beauty, in this dark tale of forbidden pleasure. A colourised version would certainly have been interesting to see, but director Tom Six has stated he never wanted the film to be seen in anything other than black-and-white. One, to make the film less offensive, but Two, to give the film a more arthouse feel to it.

Most of the acting - almost all British - is awful, and I really do mean that. It's shockingly bad. Many of the cast make Shia LaBeouf look like Al Pacino by comparison. So, you have to be quite forgiving here. And the dialogue is rotten also. Much of it, a litany of swearing and threats, that almost make you feel glad that these people are being abused/killed. This is not a film about nice people and nice things. So bear that in mind.

The one exception is Laurence Harvey as Martin, who manages to imbue the lead role with an intense humanity, that really doesn't warrant it. Martin is a man hated by everyone, and yet, somehow, he manages to come across as being the only decent human being in the entire movie. Yes, what he does is sick and despicable, but he appears to be doing this, because of repeated childhood sexual abuse from his father - thankfully now in prison. So, to a tiny degree, you almost feel sorry for him, as he channels his anger and frustration with life, into one thing, and one thing only. Feeling sorry for the most reprehensible character in a film, is certainly unusual in film-making.

So, is the film shocking? Yes. Even for most hardened gorehounds, there will be at least one moment that genuinely shocks or disturbs you. (For many, that moment is one of the last you see at the end of the film.) There is a lot of sadism on show here, and the viewers are enticed into revelling in the pain and suffering, without giving us any kind of reason to care about them. As such, I can see why the BBFC cut this film by over 3 minutes. The uncut version, is extremely brutal at times, and the monochrome footage doesn't soften some of the violence. If anything, it makes it stronger, and tougher to watch! And viewers can't file charges of sexism or misogyny against it either, as Martin is very much an equal-opportunities killer. He cares not whether his victims are male or female, as he will mistreat and abuse any of them, equally badly.

Will you enjoy this film? I think many will. There are some very dark veins of humour pulsing through this film, and any horror movie that can give you a laugh as well as a shock, has got to be worth a watch. The fact that the film ends on a downbeat note, also helps. There aren't many films which don't tie-up all the loose ends, and leave you feeling like the world is a happy place, and I enjoy those films moreso. (THE MIST is one such film, that I would urge horror fans to check-out.) But you should be aware that this is not a nice film. If you want nice, and palatable, and moderately scary, then this is not the film you should be choosing. If, however, you want a ride on the very, very dark side of the road, then this should satisfy you more than not.

As a sequel it works well, but you could watch it on its own, without having seen Part One, and still enjoy most of it. The fact director Tom Six is putting the finishing touches to THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 3: FINAL SEQUENCE, which will hopefully be released in 2014, and mark this film look like BAMBI by comparison, suggests this will go down as one of the most nauseating trilogies in film history.

But ultimately, your enjoyment or love for this film will come down to one thing, and one thing only - your own internal moral compass. Anything else is decidedly irrelevant!",1393632000,3,6032,4.617537313432836

Loved the first one though! But this one sucked. Don't watch it while you're eating dinner though. The acting was AWFUL!

The story this time around gives us an original twist and builds upon the first film beautifully. Many elements made watching The Human Centipede 2 enjoyable but one of the highlights was the performance of Laurence Harvey as Martin. I am a huge horror fan and am not disturbed by on screen violence/brutality. I highly recommend this to horror fans like myself who are not squeamish.

I love the likes of Lynch, Cronenberg, Von Trier and pretty much any other ""visionary"" of film . . . but this is an utter piece of garbage made for shock sake and nothing more. There is NOTHING redeeming about this film. I would not call it horror, indie, art or anything else other than trash. There are movies I have seen that are disturbing and have left me with nightmares. There are movie I have seen where I get sick to the stomach. This left me with nothing more than lost hope for film, period. This ""Torture Porn"" Crap that keeps popping up is honestly WORSE than even the ""Found Footage, PG-13 Crap"" constituting horror today.

More disturbing than the movie itself is that the money spent on making this piece of *#$^ could have been used for a charity to help animals or victims of abuse. I agree with other reviews that state if you get someone mentally unbalanced that watches this movie or a psycho who craves spotlight/attention, you could very easily end up with a nightmare crime on your hands.

I am a staunch supporter of freedom of speech and creativity, but honestly, what purpose does this trash serve other than shock for shock's sake?

There was absolutely no plot.  The Martin serial retarded killer made Pinhead and the other horror icons look like angels.  Folks...
let me just tell you the sin you shall be watching.
Martin smashes his mothers face in with a crowbar and plops her up at the kitchen table.
He masturbates with sand paper, and you get the view of his penis, so on.
He rapes the last women of this 12 person human centipede with barbwire wrapped around his penis.
You get the privilege of watching him staple mouths to other peoples rear ends, smash teeth in with a hammer, cut a women's tongue out, so on...
A pregnet women gives birth in a car after escaping the retarded manic and actually ends up crushing her child's head under the peddle and not even giving a crap.
Then that sick ass Martin begins shooting people, and cutting their heads off with a knife one at a time, leaving the first women of
the 12 person centipede with a decapitated head stuck to her rear.

One of the most sickest things about the film had nothing to do with the visuals. The voices in the background from the past.... An INFANT'S cries then a older man saying ""don't cry it only makes daddy's w*llie harder.""  I almost turned the film off when I 1st heard that. It was so unnecessarily sick.

  I'm not saying this just because the movie is based on one of the sickest ideas ever thought of, but simply because it's probably the most boring movie I have ever seen.
 SPOILER ALERT!  Half way into the movie (when he was still collecting people to put into the centipede), I almost just wanted to stop watching the movie because I was so bored, but this guy I work with said that it is the goriest movie out there, so I figured that I would just watch the whole thing.
  It takes forever to get to the part where he is actually ready to put the centipede together.
  The first thing about the movie that is totally unrealistic, is how nobody can seem to get out of duct tape.  I mean, they had multiple days to get their hands out of a tiny bit of duct tape, but none of them do.
  The second unrealistic thing is when he is cutting off the people's ankle tendions, and that they BARELY even scream.  same with when the guy has his teeth hammered out, and all he does is let out a painful moan.
  The third unrealistic thing is how nobody seems to try and attack him.  Especially the part where he is knelt right beside them and trying to make them fart...you're telling me that nobody tried and punch him?
  I think the only movie ending that can come near as close to how bad this one was was the ending to The Human Centipede 1.  How can they just cut it off like that?  You're telling me that he just keeps on working his job?  The pregnant woman that got away doesn't go and tell the police?  Is this whole movie just a fantasy that is playing inside his head?
  The last woman that he kills in the centipede, doesn't even try and get the knife?  She just lets him keep the knife?

4865652,4,B005S9EHL6,"The reviews I read made me think my soul or sanity was at stake should I dare to behold this un-holy atrocity. I'm a sensitive guy and  do care about what goes into the matrix of my consciousness, and so I do avoid the more purely pornographic offerings of degenerate culture. But having seen the first one and being in a fey mood one drinky night, I rolled the dice on my salvation and swiped my card at the local Red Box . Though I had to look away a few seconds here and there, I emerged from the experience spiritually unscathed and well entertained. Six could have gone much further with the graphic sadism than he did. The creator (obsessor?) of this deranged motif is no Desade. He actually shows some restraint in the most grotesque of those eventualities extending from the movies premise, whereas a genuinely degenerate muse would have riffed masturbationally upon certain taboos here present and at the nadir of common imagination. Really, we've seen gorier in modern zombie flicks.
The brilliance of Six's work is not in up-ing the ante of gore, but rather the uniqueness of his original idea and his sheer moxy in pursuing such a weirdly narrow idea into an even better realized tableau than his first strange effort. How on Earth did he persuade these talented and convincing actors to risk their future careers on this demented, coprophageic nightmare?

In a society where we have become immune to seeing video violence, this movie reawakens the feeling of horror. There isn't much of a story: a psychopath decides to attempt in real-life, what took place as a medical experiment in the 'Human Centipede' movie. However, because Martin (the main character) is not a doctor, he has to improvise (i.e. using rusty garage tools in place of sterile scalpels, and a staple gun instead of sutures). I continually found myself thinking, 'They're not actually going to SHOW that,' and then they did! If you're into that, I recommend this movie. I suggest getting the Director's Cut version over the rated one.

4865698,5,B005S9EHL6,"Which it was intended to be, of course. When Night of the Living Dead came out in 1968 it generated much the same reactions as HC2 for many or the same reasons: Gruesome plot & graphic shots of people being tortured, dismembered & eaten alive. As I recall, the makers of that film had to get their props fresh from an abbatoir to make things look real. And boy, did it work.

I see HC2 as the 21st century's NOTLD. True, there's some updating here: the use of staple guns, crowbars & duct tape as opposed to axes & plain old zombie brute strength. And more focus on the pain we inflict (or dream of inflicting, even if metaphorically) on one another as opposed to the (hopeless?) dream of escape from terror.

I think HC2 (paired with HC1 before it) is a real work of art: Brilliantly executed technically, a wonderful adjustment of perspective from the previous film & hugely adept at peeling back the social politesse to reveal what lurks underneath the surface for many of us.

I'm not saying we're all Martin, but if we don't try to understand Martin for what he is & why he is what he is, then more of us will be Martn's victims.

Well, guess what? If you are going to make a movie, even torture porn, please don't insult my intelligence.

Yes, the main character is creepy and weird, but that only goes so far. Most of the movie is very boring, and it's the same thing over and over again. Weird, fat, sweaty dude that doesn't talk brutally kidnaps people. That goes on FOREVER. Then we finally get to the end of the movie, and it's just a schlock fest.

The whole thing was very boring. No real story. It was trying to be shocking but failed miserably at it. I found the new Hansel and Gretel to be more shocking than this drivel.

3. There is almost no story-centipede's wouldn't understand a story.
4. There is a lot of sick human torture exceeding anything that a human can stand-Let's face it we human's kill and destroy centipedes home's all the time, they love watching humans suffer.
5. Human centipede-Have you ever dressed a dog up like a person? Isn't that funny? Well centipedes think the same way, it's funny.
6. The main character love's baby's-Centipedes are known for being good parents (for bugs anyway). So they can relate to the protagonist better.

The first HUMAN CENTIPEDE was only mildly acceptable thanks to the absurdist humor that came out of Dr. Heiter's character. That humor is now far removed from this second film, along with every last shred of decency. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 is even more sick and depraved than the original, with few redeeming qualities outside of the shock and gore. Martin is a disgusting human specimen on his own, let alone his plans in creating a new 'pet.' Laurence R. Harvey's screeching, bug-eyed dwarf instantly puts audiences on edge with his unnerving appearance and disreputable acts. Martin's methods lack the clinical precision of Dr. Heiter; they are crude and ineffectual, using blunted knives and a staple gun to perform his 'surgery.' The bloody results become unbearable to watch, as tendons are torn free and his twelve victims are left writhing in one big, long chain of human perversion. If anything can be said for director Tom Six, it is that he knows exactly which buttons to press in order to maximize the horrified response in his viewers. No one will leave THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 unscathed, and hopefully, no one will take after Martin.

4865806,1,B005S9EHL6,"As someone who loves horror and gore from Barker to Evil Dead and much of the violent, grotesque in between, I have to say I had hope for the hype of these films. The first Centipede was a nasty, violent affair that makes you just uncomfortable watching it, but it had some semblance of character and story, a real villain and victims you could actually want to survive.

This time around the villain is a squat parking attendant who's addicted to the original film. He fantasies about creating his own twelve-person centipede and the first 50 minutes is really just him collecting his prey. Most of the film features little dialogue and there are many, many, many looooooooooooooooooooooooong shots of naked people tied up on the floor. There's no story, just violence for the sake of it. I love horror and I have no issue with all the gore and nasty violence you can fit in the film, don't mind nudity or sex or all mixed either, but if it's just there it's boring and that's what this is.

I was constantly fast-forwarding as nothing was happening and the camera was just stuck on naked, writhing duct-taped bodies. The antagonist is no doctor, he does his work with kitchen knives and a stapler. Yeah, it's a lot of close-up detailed gore, and that's it.

Awesome! God I hope there aren't people that are actually as insane as the main character. Sadly there probably could be. A thoroughly entertaining movie that would be a psychologist's dream. Great casting for the main character as he just oozed creepiness as a warped, sweaty pervert. Not really much to the story, it is pretty much a get-what-you-pay-for script. There are some holes and obviously some unbelieveablity (hey, it could be a word), but that wasn't, nor should it have been, the focal point. The purpose of this movie is to shock, disgust and entertain the audience, which I most certainly think it does! The longer the movie progresses the more you start thinking,""he won't do that"" or ""that's not going to happen"". And the beauty is that is DOES happen.

4865928,2,B005S9EHL6,"The centipede isn't that bad. It's the protagonist; a fat guy named Martin; that's repulsive. Seeing him cough, sneeze and gag is more disgusting than what he does to other people, with the exception of him knocking someone's teeth out with a hammer. At-least I assume that's what happened. I had to look away.

Having to look away is the point as director Tom Six presents a horror sequel that's even more bloody and violent than part 1. Though there's no narrative explanation for the sudden transformation to black and white, it also looks better. There's a darker, more sinister tone here. Lacking is any kid of narrative depth.

There is a story and even some backstory. Martin, who was apparently sexually abused by his father as a child, is a die-hard fan of the first Human Centipede movie and has become obsessed with creating one of his own. But that's just a flat platform for the gimmicky concept, which is, so far, all this set has going for it.

If there's a part 3; and judging by the way this one ends, there probably will be; I'd like a centipede of all girls. If I have to watch naked people squirm around on the floor with their mouths on each other's asses, farting and squirting diarrhea, once again, I'd like for all of them to be girls; preferably attractive ones.

Not because the images on screen weren't revolting and sick, but because I had become so desensitized by the buzz, the hype and the build-up by the time I sat down and watched it, I kept thinking ""THIS is what's happened to horror?"". I expected the most shocking cinematic experience of my life (sorry, that honor goes to Pasolini in my opinion) but what I watched was an amateurish, not-very-effective attempt at assaulting my senses and sensibilities. Is this horror? No. It's an explosion in a sewer pipe, a direct jab to the jugular, a sucker punch. The movie is shot in B&W, not an original concept but it looks better than it deserves to and that is about the best thing I CAN say about it. Ultimately, a film should entertain. How can anyone assess such an experience if viewers are turning away in horror through most of it (or the trailers want us to believe that's what they did)?. Quite honestly, I found it boring and silly. I yawned twice, checked my phone several times and got up once to get a snack. And I'm not a goremonger, I get queasy pretty easily. But this film didn't even deserve my revulsion. The violence and gore are so redundant, so deliberate that after a while I simply was no longer shocked. Bottom line, the film is a novelty and proof that with the right publicity machine you can make people buy/watch/love anything. It's the work of an amateur and he should have stuck to the concept of the first installment, even though the plot was thin-as-his-leading-ladies, at least it DID have a plot!

After seeing seemingly hundreds of by the numbers horror movies, this is one of the very few that has ever left me with a lingering emotional reaction after it was over. Part of me loved it, and part of me was very glad it was finally over. That all being said, only part of this movie really made me feel like a boundary was being crossed. And that is the baby scene in the car. Not only do I think that violence towards babies is inappropriate and crossing a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, but I was also upset at it because it was so unnecessary for the film. The whole quick, pointless subplot that leads to this brutally uncalled for sequence has no buildup and nothing that affects the plot afterwards. It simply adds a disgusting, unneeded moment to the film. I'm all for Tom Six's intent not only to make brutal movies but to also continue to up the ante in this series in particular.

4865932,2,B005S9EHL6,"<strong>The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence</strong> (Tom Six, 2011)

Okay, I'm probably going to catch some flak for saying what I am about to say, because we all know that <em>The Human Centipede</em> was a cheap exploitation flick, am I wrong? But despite that, <em>The Human Centipede II</em> feels <em>more</em> like a cheap explitation flick than the original did, so I'm going to compare the two by alleging that this one is and the first one isn't. Bear with me, it's all relative. I promise.

Plot: Martin (Laurence R. Harvey in his screen debut) is a misfit loner, possibly mentally challenged, who lives with his psychotic mother (Vivien Bridson in her feature debut) and his incredibly large centipede. He is obsessed with Tom Six's movie <em>The Human Centipede</em>, and eventually gets the idea to try to replicate the movie in real life, but with a dozen segments instead of three. He uses his job as a night watchman in a parking garage to be able to approach people, incapacitate them, and drag them back to a warehouse he's not quite renting (you'll see how that works). If you've seen the original, you know what's coming next. It is well within the bounds of Martin's character that he becomes a tinpot dictator like Dr. Heiter never was...

...and ultimately, that's why I didn't like this one as much as I did the one before (not that I was all that big a fan of the original). While it <em>is</em> completely within Martin's character to run the cheap exploitation tricks he does on his creation, that doesn't make them any less gratuitous from the POV of the viewer. It feels like a Russ Meyer cash grab, except Russ Meyer had some basic semblance of class, as odd as that statement may sound.

Given the premise, you can also expect a whole lot of meta with this. While there are times that such antics are grimly amusing (Ashlynn Yennie, who played Jenny in the original film, is back playing... Ashlynn Yennie), there are some scenes where Six takes it way, way overboard, to an almost embarrassing degree (when mum finds Martin's <em>Human Centipede</em> scrapbook, especially).

...and I'd have been willing to forgive most of that if not for the movie's final shot, which is most definitely a cheap cash grab that makes me hate everything about this movie. If Australia had banned the film for that final shot instead of the brash, exploitative gore, that would have made a hell of a lot more sense, at least to me. * ",1341532800,4,2450,4.725995316159251

4865935,1,B005S9EHL6,"Let's go over the standard arguments.

1. You know what this movie is about. It's about a maniac attaching people in a line from mouth to rear. A large portion of the world would give that sentence zero stars, let alone choose to watch and review a movie about it. Therefore, if you have a moral or just biological aversion to that sort of thing, quit reading these reviews and move on. It's not fair to give a movie zero stars just because you find the premise repellant.

2. It's not supposed to be art. Six does a competent directing job, and he's adept at creating suspense and unease. The main character, Martin, is so ably played by newcomer Laurence Harvey that it seems odd to believe the actor didn't inspire the script. The black and white and the focus of the story contrast cleverly with the first film, which was downright clinical compared to this. The point (part of it) seems to be that the depravity experienced by the victims is nothing compared to that of the villain. But all of this is really just a footnote to the main point, which is graphic torture, gore, and people eating a lot of ""down there desserts."" This is hammered home by the inclusion of only one color to the film's palette, and it ain't turquoise. The point being, you can't give the film zero stars just because it is artless, pointless, and base if that's what it aspires to be. You can't complain that your hot dog doesn't taste enough like a steak.

3. Is it done well? Ah. The most important question. You can argue story, characters, setting and dialogue all you want, but if a movie doesn't want to have those things, or if it seeks to be a cartoon of them, then so be it. You judge a film by its own goals, not your preferences. And in that respect, this film fails.

You heard me.

Look. This is all fake. We all know that. The power of a film -- good or bad -- is to draw you into its world so firmly and deeply that, even if you loathe what you are seeing, you still invest part of yourself into the reality. It's called suspension of disbelief, and gory movies have used the natural human aversion for pain as a way to skip the tough work that usually a plot or characters do to slowly pull a viewer in and hold them fast to the film. You see something graphic, and an instinctive part of you is jolted into that reality, happily or not-so. As tech has improved, films have found more and more envelopes to push, sometimes for no other reason than to say, ""Look at how convincing this is!""

This film is not convincing. The gore is so overboard, that it becomes a parody of itself. The movie seems to hint that it is supposed to be a comedy. There is more than one obvious ploy for humor as Martin interacts (silently) with his psychotic mother, ludicrously lecherous psychiatrist, malicious and thick-necked upstairs neighbor, a whole host of drunk, obnoxious, or unfortunate people with cars, and even an actress from the first film who is lured into his clutches because she thinks he's involved with a Quentin Tarantino film. Ha ha ha ha ha! Hilarious! Now let's kill them all!

Wait a minute. The horror wave of exploitative torture isn't funny, nor is it meant to be. Or maybe I didn't get a memo or something. At any rate, say what you will about the film just being goofy or playing tongue-in-cheek or just being a lampoon of the first, this kind of dismissiveness is one kind too many in a film where the thrills are meant to be a more visceral kind of voyeurism. As a result, you cannot help but be pulled out of the reality of the film and into a world where people who are wide awake, of above average build, and bound by a single strip of duct tape politely lie almost perfectly still while someone knocks out their teeth or cuts up their knees. They wriggle and grimace and scream to show you it hurts, of course, but they don't appear to have enough energy to, say, turn over or thrash violently or even slip their hands out of the loose and blood-slicked tape.

That's just one example. I could listen dozens and dozens of more where the scene, moment, or very idea is so outlandish that it's very ludicrousness robs it of any power it could have. As a result, I spent most of the movie wondering how each special effect was achieved, or how these actors felt midway through filming, or what the conversations were like in between takes. And please don't think I'm saying this to say how tough I am. There were at least two moments where I was pulled into the film's sickness, where it was looking for an effect and it pulled it off. Overall, however, the movie was so excessive that it became redundant and stupid, and both of those things are bad no matter WHAT kind of film you're trying to make.

But does that mean I get to give it zero stars? Maybe the film WANTED to be an over-the-top parody, a farce, a redundant, relentless, uninspired hate letter to its audience. Even if this were true, I finally chose to give the film this website's lowest rating because...

People who say this has no class or background were simply too distracted by the gore of the film or had a bad thought in mind before viewing which made the experience nothing.  I watched the film 3 times... first to watch a sequel second to find the character development and third for my final understanding.  Now a days viewers only look at the surface of a movie and miss the psychological games and, in this movie,  the chance to get into the mind of Martin.  People need to approach movies like this with an open mind and if you don't like the movie you don't like the movie, don't force your opinion on others saying the movie was a waste because that other parson may not think the same way.

I feel that even bad movies have something someone can take from them, this movie is only movie I have ever felt that had nothing to offer anyone. There is such little character development that it is almost non existent. The only characters that have any development are killed off. I might have even felt sorry for either of these characters if they hadn't been developed as characters you want to hate. The total lack of character development for the victims might have been ok, given the scenario we meet them, however they are so blatantly stupid that I can't feel sorry for them as they essentially let, if not help, the main character do this to them. They are clearly left unattended for long periods of time in an unlocked room. Sure some of them are bound by duct tape, but not all of them. There is literally nothing stopping these people from leaving. They are so hopeless that they don't even move from the positions the main character drags them to. If all of that wasn't bad enough when he starts his 'procedure' on these people they do nothing to resist, despite being fully conscious.

I might have given this movie a second star if it were something I could put on and just do chores while I listen to it. The almost total lack of dialogue makes that impossible however.

4865979,2,B005S9EHL6,"I remember watching this in a little art-house theater in the middle of nowhere with other freaks, all getting together to get as grossed out as possible. Now that was a grindhouse experience that was interesting. So what I'll remember most fondly about this endurance test is the experience moreso than the movie, and I think that's how other people approach this too, to see if they can stomach it.

Well the plot is nearly non-existent, right off the bat Martin (a pudgy bug-eyed security attendant) is bludgeoning poor blokes that are in his parking lot after hours with a crowbar and tying them up with duct tape in the back of his hearse. When he's not gathering up people he's either watching the Human Centipede 1 or going home and getting screamed at by his psycho mother. The first half was very reminicent of David Lynch's Eraserhead with all the B&W weirdness, which pretty much establishes the few necessities for the plot. Basically Martin gets a warehouse big enough for his pet project and gathers random people, that's the first half of the movie summed up.

Now the second half is where things get disgusting, unlike the first Human Centipede a surgeon Martin ain't, and he botches a few things while his victims remain tied up and fully aware. Before we really get into things let me explain one aspect of the series that I like so far, this movie is drastically different from the first one. Whereas the first movie was from the victim's point of view and all the disgusting parts were skipped and the whole movie takes place in a sterile setting, the sequel centers around the psychopath, is filmed in black and white, and mostly takes place in a gritty dungeon-esque warehouse. The two 'doctors' from both movies look exceptionally creepy as well, so I'm looking foward (albiet in a sick way) to the third movie, to see how it'll be different from these two vastly contrasting movies.

Anywhoo, Martin starts constructing his 12-piece centipede after he gets the star of the first movie in a funny but illogical way, and from there on the Human Centipede 2 becomes exactly what people paid for: an endurance test. In case you're curious about what happens but don't want to actually see it I'll list everything I remember off the top of my head in order (from the uncut version):
-people get beat with a crowbar/shot in the legs
-Martin masturbates with sandpaper
-his mom gets her face bit by a desert centipede then literally gets her face bashed in
-Martin's therapist gets his balls shot, then he gets shot in the head
-people get their teeth beaten in with a hammer
-a man's buttcheeks get sliced open and he bleeds out
-Martin uses a rusty scapel to slice people's knee tendons open
-Martin staples people's lips to each other's anuses
-Martin shoves a tube all the way down the front person's asophagus and injects laxatives into people's butts
-Martin rips the front person's tongue out to stop her from screaming
-the people start pooping in each other's mouths with messy results (one color is shown here, guess which one?)
-Martin ties barbed wire around his penis and rapes the woman in the back (this was really horrifying for me to watch, and I'd say I'm pretty jaded with these kinds of films)
-a pregnant woman presumed dead wakes up and runs to the car while giving birth, and stomps her newborn's head in accidently during the frantic escape
-while the woman's escaping the centipede splits in half when a man rips his lips out of the other man's anus, you see the man's lips all bloody and feces spewing out of his mouth while the other man's ass is torn open, very nasty stuff
-Martin in a rage comes back and excecutes the back centipede, shooting them all in the head, he runs out of bullets for the front half and uses a knife to carve open their throats
-the last person alive (the actress from the 1st one) knocks Martin down and shoves his pet centipede down his anus, he retaliates by stabbing her in the throat and walks out of the warehouse

And that's basically what happens in a nutshell, after all that disgusting chaos Martin's back at his job hearing a baby one of his victim's left behind still crying in the parking lot, was it a dream? If you stop and think about some things it really doesn't make sense, like how didn't the guy who got the duct tape off his mouth not bite other people's duct tape bondage and free them all? How did those people survive with such blunt force truama to the head? How did a short fat schlubby guy manage to kidnap most of these athletic looking young men? Blah blah blah, at the end of the day this movie was made to be as disgusting as possible, people can argue if it's art but hey, it's something different. Tom Six's stated that for the final film there's going to be 500+ people in the centipede. All I can say is Holy S***.

Quick Side Note: Roger Ebert's logic makes no sense to me, he says the first movie doesn't really get a rating and just exists in it's own universe (kind of how I feel about rating this movie with stars), while this one got 0 stars and was called 'abhorrent'. They exist in the same universe, the only real difference was that this one was way more disgusting, so I think ol' Ebert was just disgusted and decided to change his opinion about the same concept he rated before, whatever.",1337385600,6,5308,4.55392670157068

Although the whole movie is pretty unbelievable I could not get over the fact that these people before they are even attached to one another were just laying around on the floor of this big warehouse secured with just duct tape securing each of them.  All while this fat clown is out and about for what looks like days at a time.  All these poor fools had to do was use the floor to peel the duct tape off their mouths and then use their mouth to bite through the rest of the duct tape on them.  Then wait for the fat clown to come back and clobber him.  What dummies.  One of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I have to say the way they showed the fat clown treating his wife was probably the most entertaining part of the movie.  Especially how he used her as a decoy for that clod playing loud music upstairs... hahahah.

I have seen it all from the Japanese style frightfests to low budget horror to zombie flicks to the ultra violent torture themes that are so prevalent today. With that being said, I am not that easily shocked, probably the last time I was moved or nervous by a horror film was the first time I watched the Exorcist,(I'm dating myself),and in the last few years perhaps Cannibal Holocaust. This film is vile,disturbing,extremely disgusting,and when it is finished,if you make it all the way to the end,you will feel as if you immediately require a shower. If I am rating this movie solely on production value,easily 5 stars. The black and white method of shooting the film was pure genius,with director Six creating a dark and gritty patina that transferred effectively to the viewer. Character creation,another win. Martin was extremely convincing to the point that you actually wondered if they cast an actual mentally disturbed and violent recluse for the part. Then theres the actual story...more than halfway throught the film the whole thing kind of falls apart,in the first film of course you had a brilliant but demented surgeon,now we are treated to a twisted human mole with household tools,duct tape and a staple gun. The subject matter is what it is,watching this movie after having viewed the first installment you obviously have to expect it to be disturbing,but wow,it crosses lines that no other film in my memory has before,and I suppose the fact that during certain parts I cringed and almost turned completely away means the film delivered its desired effect. I cannot remember the last time I felt absolute revulsion while watching any film,let alone extreme horror,but this piece was a dandy. I think the point where I almost jumped off the Human Centipede train was as a previous reviewer pointed out that towards the climax a single color was allowed onto the pallette...brown. If you have seen the first movie,you will know what I'm getting at. All in all,and this is comoing from a severe horror movie buff,this one kind of left me wondering just how far is too far...watch if you dare my friends.

4865987,4,B005S9EHL6,"This is a good film for those who like films whose content makes folks turn their heads, cringe, and walk out of movies.  If you're a Human Centipede fan, though, don't expect a movie about a human centipede and let this sequel take you to a somewhat different land of moral paucity.  I give this a thumbs up for gorehounds.

 The Human Centipede: First Sequence (2010) really tried to test the limits of what Americans would sit through and claim to enjoy.  It tackled some serious medical curiosities--chief amongst them being what happens when you staple someone's mouth to someone else's business-end?  Can someone survive on a feces-only diet?  And is it medically provable that it sucks the most to be the middle segment of a human centipede?

 Our sequel begins precisely as the original ends.  Except that in the sequel, the original is the ""actual original movie"" being watched by our new mad scientist.  He is inordinately short, stout, balding, and has rather protruding eyes and cheeks; both child-like and off-putting.  He makes an excellent sociopath.  I won't ruin the surprise, but Ashley Yennie (Jenny from First Sequence) makes a major appearance in this film and the way Martin encounters her is very funny.

 The First Sequence was told through the eyes of the victems, as most such stories would be.  The Full Sequence tells the story through the eyes of our mentally retarded, obsessive amateur surgeon, Martin.  Martin lives with his psychologically abusive (and rather demented) mother.  He quietly tries to avoid her as he perpetually wheezes and sweats his way around the house.  Working as a parking lot security attendant, Martin recruits centipede segments late at night.  He doesn't discriminate or target the weak; anyone will do.  He's also quite handy with a crowbar.  You'll wince.

 Writer/director Tom Sixx had spoken some pretty strong words about how intense this sequel would be.  He explained that part two would make part one look like the ""my little pony"" of human centipedes.  Sixx did succeed at somehow making a very different-styled movie from the same idea with some interesting nuance, however I would contest that he completely failed at pushing the envelope and further testing our limits.

 Sure, Martin is an awkwardly disturbing character--who never utters a word of dialogue, by the way--but the original dug its dirty fingernails into moral limits much more deeply.  The First Sequence delivered the utter terror and rage of the victems when captured.  Once assembled, the victems eyes, holding hands and muffled cries conveyed terror while also demonstrating their futile compassion for each other amidst this morally abject scenario.  Again, I understand that First Sequence was told through their eyes and Full Sequence wasn't.  But what did Full Sequence give me instead?  Other than a very cleverly architected and effective villain, nothing at all.

 Despite this shortcoming and noting that I enjoyed the First Sequence, I very much enjoyed this movie.  Martin is delightfully evil and somehow naively innocent at the same time.  His obsessive mania for Tom Sixx's First Sequence was a spiffy story device and his expressions of delight or frustration with his experiment made me recoil.  The biggest flaw of this movie is that it's really about Martin's obsession and not his human centipede pet project.  Fans of the first should be encouraged to watch this sequel, but do so expecting something quite different from a larger, more disturbingly macabre centipede.  If you want that, then hang around for Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), which promises an irrationally long chain or patients linked by an irrational surgery.",1335916800,6,3690,5.115577889447236
4866048,4,B005S9EHL6,"I'm not sure what movie the other reviewers were watching, but the one I saw is clearly the inner fantasy of a highly disturbed individual.  Of course things don't logically make sense, and of course the filmmaker cuts scenes abruptly because this is how the mind works.  When Martin, the protagonist, is in his white coat, we are into pure dark fantasy, because parking garage attendants don't actually wear white coats.  He is copying his idol from the first movie, Dr. Heiter (where things logically could have happened.) The inner struggle of this character between hatred, rage, the desire for revenge, and guilt are what drive this movie.  Can you staple and duct tape people together anus to mouth?  Of course not; the staples would tear almost immediately.  The building-the-centipede scenes, while overlong (which is why I knocked it down a star) are pure revenge and rage fantasy.  If I'm an overweight, abused, semi-retarded individual, how would I connect people together like Dr. Heiter did in the original?  Duct and staples leap to mind, since they would be all I would have at hand. What I find interesting about this movie is how it depicts Martin's struggle with his own worst enemy -- his own mind.",1335830400,6,1217,4.87378640776699

I guess this movie would be good for someone who is exactly like the guy in the movie who is torturing this collection of people.  The only thing I can think of to say as far as this movie's point of existence is if you want to test your ability to hold in barf, this is a great test.

This just degrades into the silly after the first 5 minutes.  I don't dislike ""bad"" movies (I love Plan 9 and The Lost Skeleton), but this was just boring and silly.  It's not particularly gross or horrific.  It's poorly exiectuted and makes absolutely no effort to hide it or the the stupidity of it all. I mean, a 280 lb guy who looks like a weight lifter 1) fails to break out of one round of cheap duct tape that happens to be falling off another guys mouth and 2) he sits as still as he possibly can while his teeth are knocked out - a preggo who is unbound except for her feet doesn't move for DAYS and decides to run for it only after being declared dead, AND The chick at the front just sits there without struggle while her tongue is torn out.  I don't care how much of a concussion you have, if you can scream, you can move.

It's almost as painfull to watch as the 30TH anniversary remake of Night of the Living Dead (DON'T BUY IT - I implore you).

The First Sequence was slightly disturbing...  but it was different and entertaining.  It felt a little ""edgy"" or something.  It was cool, plain and simple.  So when we found out about The Human Centipede 2, I knew I had to get it for her.  We set up a night to watch it just recently, and sat down with our dinner and drinks, just like we did for the first one.....  only this time neither of us finished our dinner.  Mostly I couldn't look away, but at times I couldn't look directly at the TV either.  Some of the sound effects, although borderline childish, still made it difficult to watch.  The hammer.  The scissors.  The staple gun and the crow bar....

She gagged.
I hid behind pillows.
It ended, and I went home feeling dirty.

However, I can't say I didn't enjoy it.  As other reviewers have stated, this movie pretty-much ""goes there.""  It shows you everything that was left to your imagination in the 1st movie.  You ask a question, it answers.

4866055,4,B005S9EHL6,"Not that anybody's really been asking for it, but here it is-The Human Centipede 2!!  And Oddly enough I like it more than the first film.  The first film, while decently directed and all, was pretty much nothing more than overrated torture porn with a novel idea.....at least I think so.  With this sequel, director Tom Six has gone a different direction with the same novel idea.  Here it's more in the vein of the whole psychological character study of a disturbed mind-Martin: A Portrait Of A Movie Obsessed Psycho, if you will.  Plus there's an artsy Lynch-esque twist on it.  Whether or not this whole aproach works, is up to viewer interpretation, but I will say that this movie does fall into some of the cliches of that style just as the first film fell into the cliches of torture porn.
So here in Centipede 2, we have Martin, a security officer(though I'd sure never feel secure with him around) of a parking garage.  He's overweight, sweaty, bug eyed, wheezy and asthmatic.  Definitely not the typical horror psycho who is usually charismatic or just outrageously crazy and wild.  Martin's cut more from the Ed Gein cloth-Yeah, we all think he's weird, but he couldn't possibly be threatening, right?  He's more pathetic than menacing.  But no less deranged!!
Well, Martin's got a lousy home life-His mother wants him dead, he was sexually abused by his dad, and he's balding.  So, he spends his time obsessing over the film, The Human Centipede.  He's constantly watching it and even has a scrapbook of everything associated with it.  So naturally he gets the idea that he wants to replicate it, but upping the ante by making a twelve person centipede.  Why not?  Bad choice of films to want to copy though.  Imagine how many lives would be saved if Martin had been obsessed with, and wanted to re-enact Grease or Kazaam.
Thankfully the film isn't paced like a television commercial, and takes it's time to tell the story.  Mostly it consists of Martin's scenes at home with his mother and the numerous sequences where he rounds up his victims from the parking garage.  He even manages to lure the lead actress from the first Human Centipede movie, though that whole scenario is rather hard to believe that it could happen that way.  The last half hour of the movie takes place entirely in Martin's rented warehouse where he performs the ""surgery"", brings his ""centipede"" to life and has it re-enact highlights from the first movie.  This particular ""centipede"" proves to be a bit more rebellious and uncooperative than the one in the first film.  And as you can imagine, this all can't end to well for everyone.
Though more artsy than the first film, Six somehow makes this one all the more schlocky and exploitative.  He pulled out all the stops as far as the centipede's construction goes.  For the first time around, you actually had to use your imagination as far as the surgery and it's effects were concerned.  Not now!  Now we're shown the teeth pulled out(or knocked out with a hammer more precisely), the butt cheeks sliced off, the knees and tendons slashed, the mouths stapled, and of course.....the pooping!  Had to including the pooping to keep it all from treading into any kind of tasteful territory.  You see, Martin's no doctor, so the surgery is rather crude.  If the doctor's surgery in the first film is like Bob Vila building a shed, then Martin's surgery is like myself building the same shed.....and that's bad.  Sloppy, completely uncoordinated and just plain bad.
For me, it was hard to really feel anything watching this, if feeling anything was really the intention.  There isn't one likeable character in this film, not one.  Anyone with any speaking lines is just a despicable human being, and most of the poor victims aren't given much to do other than lie, bound, gagged, squirming on the warehouse floor.  It's unfortunate, but in a day and age when any film that qualifies as ""horror"" includes characters who are incapacitated, screaming and tortured, it's all rather desensitizing.  Sad but true, in the words of Metallica.
I guess I'm still kinda unsure of what Six was trying to accomplish here exactly.  A message about media and violence with the whole movie within a movie thing?  A deranged character study?  A grossout?  Shock?  Horror?  A middle finger aimed at critics of the first film?  Humorous, dark schlock(I don't know if it was supposed to be funny, but a gruesome scene with a baby actually made me laugh at how outrageous and Troma-like it was)?  Hell, I don't know.  But I do know that people are gonna take this movie in a variety of different ways and take different things away from it.  I suppose that's kind of the point, eh?
Well, with that said, view at your own risk, though I'd discourage watching it on a first date.
I don't think I'll purchase this movie, or even watch it again any time soon, but for whatever reason, I did enjoy it....much more than the first one.",1334966400,5,4944,4.725467289719626

"" Makes SAW and HOSTEL look like teenage  comedy movies"" - ***Doum666***

I've been wanting to see this film for a long time. The first sequence was definitely a worldwide horror classic and manage to do the ""Shocking and disturbing""  job very well.  When the first sequence came out, there was a lot of arguing about the film; is it garbage or is it art? I remember having to defend and explain my point several times, not only here on Amazon but with friends and co-workers as well. You see, for a lot of people, the line can be very thin between what is art and what is garbage, or what is acceptable and what is not. Again people, this is a horror film meant to shock, not a Disney release...

This second installment goes even further with Martin, a short, obese, asthmatic and mentally ill freak who's obsessed with ""The Human Centipede"" (1st film) and tries to do like the real doctor in the first film (Dr Josef Heiter) and create a  centipede on his own. A 12 people centipede. The only problem is that poor Martin doesn't have any Medical knowledge and relies on the first film's instructions by Dr Josef Heiter to make is own....Being mentally ill, incontinent, emotionally unstable, seriously retarded and without any medical knowledge, Martin will struggle to try and make is 12 pieces centipede.....

In response to the controversy surrounding the ""100% Medically Accurate"" statement on the first film cover, this 2nd movie cover shows ""100% medically Inaccurate"" and i think people will find out why. The film did have some classification refusal issues and almost got banned from UK and Australia due to the film being ""too extreme, sexually violent and potentially obscene"". A modified version of the film including several cuts was submitted and finally accepted for both countries. The movie was also the first film since THE EXORCIST (1979), ZOMBIE (by fulci)(1979) and ANGUISH (1985) to be shown in theatres with medical personal and barf bags....

The cinematography is also excellent despite the lack of color. The film was indeed shot in color but was later turned to black and white. The result was a near perfect blend of ""black and white"" with an almost imperceptible tint of green (unless this is only my TV settings...). Very effective camera shots and angles.
I think director Tom Six wanted to push this one as far as possible...Everything you can imagine actually happens...I was very shocked and surprised on several scenes myself! This is honestly the sickest ride i ever been on. Once again, not for the faint of heart! This is art in its most sickest and twisted form, not for everyone, only real ""extreme"" horror fans.

4866127,4,B005S9EHL6,"This black and white movie follows a new madman that obsesses over the first movie Human Centipede. He watches it time and time again in his security office of a parking garage. He plots, plans and fantasizes making his own human centipede capped off with a star from the first film. This movie is really about him and his obsession before and when he makes the centipede with more people than the first film had. This madman is a heavy giant bellied disgusting man that lives with his mother and the only man who tries to help is a psychologist more interested in molesting him. You get to see into his psyche and why he might be messed up enough to really do this. His mother blames him for everything, the only help he could get seems to molest him and he gets picked on by society due to his weight, height and looks.

The disgusting protagonist goes around shooting and beating victims over the head with a giant metal crow bar... and it makes me think they'd be dead from brain hemorrhaging. It is so laughable how people survive things that it made me think a bullet to the head would mean the victim would be alive in the next scene. The villain loads them into his van and whisks them away to his evil warehouse. He keeps them there before making the medical procedure.

If you like blood and squeamish moments this is for you, however the squeamish moments really only come toward the time that he makes the centipede. He cuts things, breaks teeth and duct tapes them together with their posterior to the mouth of the next person. I'm shocked enough actors signed up for this job.

It sticks with you for awhile. Warning NOT FOR THE FAIN OF HEART. If you are twisted check this crazy film out.",1332288000,2,735,4.111111111111111
4866192,2,B005S9EHL6,"We purchased this movie with great anticipation after seeing the first installment. Let me start off by asking the question WHY BLACK AND WHITE?...In my opinion this really detracts from the enjoyment of the graphic nature of the flick, which was supposedly its calling card. This movie has no coherent plot and almost zero dialog from the actors. The main character does not say a word almost throughout the entire movie. This flick exists for the sole purpose of gore and it does not even do that right. Save your money.",1332201600,6,522,4.747252747252747

About the second, ""The explicit presentation of the central character's obsessive sexually violent fantasies is in breach of Classification Guidelines and poses a real, as opposed to a fanciful, risk that harm is likely to be caused to potential viewers.""

4866258,1,B005S9EHL6,HC1 was  badly acted and  deeply flawed. In HC2  the lead actor gives a brilliant performance without using any dialogue. His  facial expressions  are  deserving  of an oscar. The film was the most disgusting that I have ever seen and we  are promised  that HC3 will be  even more gross.  It is not without its flaws however. The very first warehouse scene  has the owner talking to the  guy hiring it. There is a sudden jump in the editing and  we next see the  owner lying on the floor with blood gushing from his stomach. What happened and why was it not in the film? This important scene is missing  from both the  cut and uncut versions of the film. Can anyone  tell me why?,1330905600,4,679,4.296

4866261,3,B005S9EHL6,"First, let me preface by saying that this film is made extremely well.  Six does a great job.  There's a reason he had such a strong following with the first movie, and he definitely ""one-ups"" the first sequence.

Second, I have watched both Aftermath and Nekromantik.  This made Nekromantik look like a walk in the playground, because at least Nekromantik has enough absurdity and artistic creativity that it creates a glass barrier between the realm of gross and possible.  Aftermath removed that barrier, but was only 25 minutes long.  Human Centipede 2 is close to 90 min., and shatters that barrier.  It reaches the level of disturbing that I anticipate Aftermath would have reached had it been an hour longer.

Six really outdoes himself and takes horror to a level I didn't know existed. Props to him for making a self-respected horror fan truly cringe.  At the end of the movie, my husband and I just sat there speechless.

My Recommendation in a Nutshell:  If you're a fan of gore, you're definitely about to see something new, and if you're not a fan...you will probably turn it off long before you vomit all over yourself.",1330732800,10,1133,4.758974358974359
4866262,1,B005S9EHL6,"I usually don't rate movies at all that I would rate one star (not even that much if I could in this case). They don't deserve the attention. But this one did for the following reason. I read that part of the director's inspiration for the film was Pasolini's movie ""Salo, 120 days of Sodom"". The only thing that shocks more than the film is that anyone could think that this `product' has any artistic merit or is in any way comparable to Pasolini's work.

There is no artistic merit in either Centipede film. It has no value as any kind of social commentary whatsoever. It is pure and simple torture, and the emphasizing of the helplessness of the victims. The connection between the suffering individuals is not a glimpse of humanity, it just emphasizes the helplessness in order to magnify the suffering. I'm sure someone out there will try to call it art, but remember the guy who defecated in a jar and put it up as an art exhibit? Remember Piss Christ? These are things people do because creating real art is hard work, and they've no idea how to create art. A film like this is an indication of the sterility and lack of ideas in the culture we've created.

The doctor in the first Centipede was obviously a sociopath. The man in this film is probably sociopathic and psychotic. The ""I've been bullied so I'm going to make you suffer"" motif doesn't lend anything to the film at all. I'm not recommending ""I Spit on Your Grave"", but at least the character development lent some believability to the revenge-torture in that film. But what also strikes the audience in that film is the emptiness of the revenge. You don't even get those feelings here. It's like fishing people off the street and ripping them to shreds. All it has going is the shock value. Once it wears off, you wish you hadn't watched this at all. Perhaps the idea of being shocked can be likened to the fact that heightened arousal leads us often to sleep with someone we normally wouldn't touch, and getting the feeling after that you'll never be able to wash the taste out of your mouth. We want to be shocked, so we watch it.

There's not enough character development for any real connections to be made with the people involved. It's just a pure torture flick that is attempting to make money off of the pure depiction of suffering with a gimmick. So, don't expect any character development or any kind of real human interaction in this film. It's pure torture. The assailant doesn't speak a line in the film.

Don't pay money for this film; I don't recommend watching it at all. Spare yourself.",1330646400,22,2574,4.540948275862069
4866263,3,B005S9EHL6,"I enjoyed the first one more than the second.  The doctor in the first one was very clinical and a man of science.  The villian in this one is the polar opposite of the good doctor in the first.  Choosing the complete opposite was an interesting idea but I didn't care much for Martin's character.  All Martin did was make noises (Martin doesn't speak in the movie) which get somewhat annoying considering they happen when he is trying to motivate a bowel movement from the centipede.  Also, if Martin was trying to copy the good doctor from the first flick...why does he wear baggy tighty whites with his lab coat open??  Since he is trying to immitate I would think he would be a bit cleaner in his appearance and surgical/medical environment.  The other thing I didn't care for is it was somewhat choppy.  It showed Martin beaning a woman with a crowbar then all of a sudden she is bound and gagged in a warehouse.  It never shows Martin moving the bodies which I would have liked to see especially in the heavy rain with a bad asthma condition and his stunted growth.

The other thing that stuck out was the police were never notified?  People were missing from a certain area and not one showing of the police just seems odd since the victims had friends, families or clients.  The police didn't even show up when people went missing from the apartment building.  Just seems odd since they appeared in the first one and nothing here.

I don't want to ruin it but it also never showed what happened to one of the victims or a child that appeared.

There were only a few things about the movie I did enjoy.  One was the appearance of the actress from the first film and how it was shown as a film.  The other was that it was filmed in black and white (except the feces splattering on the screen...they did use brown for the poo) which gave it a seedy appearance.  It fit with the delapitated warehouse and Martin's perversions.  The reason for the black and white was to tone down the gore which was actually nice.  One can only watch so much poo being exerted from one anus into another's mouth.  After a while it gets old and the shock value wears off.

All in all it was OK, I watched it thinking I would enjoy it as much as the first but it just didn't seem as effective as the first.  It contains gore and poo but just seems pointless.",1330560000,4,2343,4.36027713625866

He as no lines, and for most of the movie shoots or beats his victims only later cutting them up and putting them together with a staple gun and duct tape. Although it was done on purpose the video quality sucks...breaking off and lighting blinking on and off.

The sequel to Human Centipede (The First Sequence), Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is a unique format. Instead of building the second movie off the events, and timeline, of the first film, this sequel uses the First Sequence as the catalyst for the events of the Full Sequence. That's why this film is 100% medically inaccurate instead of the first Human Centipede's 100% medically accurate status.

Martin (Laurence R. Harvey - cinematic debut) has some problems; physically he's short, overweight, and a bit awkward, and because of mental, physical, and sexual abuse he doesn't speak, can only perform the simplest jobs, and is a bit socially awkward. Oh yeah, Martin is also obsessed with the movie The Human Centipede (The First Sequence). That is if obsessed means you watch the movie continuously, have a scrap book documenting various aspects of the movie, and (shudder) you become aroused at certain points of the movie. So, yeah, obsessed is a good way to describe him.

So, Martin is obsessed with the film Human Centipede (The First Sequence) and, because of certain situations throughout his life, is determined to not only replicate the process from the first movie, but to outdo it by a factor of four. Whereas in the first one the doctor was a successful surgeon, with state of the art facility in his basement, and the knowledge to make the procedure 100% medically accurate, Martin is not as accomplished. In fact Martin lives in relative poverty with a mother that hates him for having her husband imprisoned, who abused Martin physically, mentally, and sexually for most of his life. His doctor may or may not be abusing him, and the neighbors intimidate him. The only plus to Martin is his job in a parking structure, which allows him the privacy to watch his movie, and hunt for his subjects. Okay, here's the meat of the movie; Martin is going to outdo his obsession by creating a human centipede consisting of twelve (yes, I said 12) subjects. Of the twelve two die, one is his intimidating neighbor; eight are innocent victims who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His coup de grace is the acquisition of Ashlynn Rennie (Human Centipede) one of the actresses who played in the original, whom he has tricked into becoming his number one (and not in a good way). Remember, Martin doesn't have the education or the money to perform the operations properly, with a well outfitted facility, so he acquires a warehouse, his surgical kit comes from a toolbox under the sink, anesthesia courtesy of a crowbar, sutures from Swingline, and bandages are duct tape. Anything from this point onward is either a spoiler, or inappropriate.

The first installment of this trilogy was a masterpiece of ingenuity and disturbingness. The second film could have been a contender for with first; the first film itself is used as an influence vice a starting point, it was shot in black and white to enhance the feeling of unhealthiness and lack of sanitation, and the simple fact that a man is prepared to not only recreate but to surpass a fictional event without the proper facilities. Several problems occur though. One is what I call `Too Much'; in this case too much is wrong with Martin. Hey, pick one, maybe two, but did he have to be mentally, physically, and sexually abused by his father, the target of other sexual predators, socially awkward and unattractive, and despised by the mother that keeps trying to kill him and commit suicide because her husband is in prison for his atrocities against Martin. It bothered me that I couldn't find Martin as a sympathetic character, because I really wanted to. I think that if he had any combination of two of his problems a cruel insanity could have been portrayed as cruelly insane. Another problem I have is that I'm a fan of retribution, and this film didn't use the retribution factor to a fulfilling and disgusting end. Of the four characters that Martin has cause to seek retribution against only two ends up as part of the experiment. As to the disgusting point, how would you feel if he had put dear ol' mummy in the middle of the line-up.  I just threw up in mouth a little bit just writing that. Human Centipede II is a good movie, just not a great movie. It has all the right elements; tension, disturbing situations, and an innovative idea, but the execution could have been better. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, it simply could've been better. This movie isn't for everyone, but I liked it.

4866267,1,B005S9EHL6,"I was absolutely stoked to see this movie. I had seen the first one many times, it had a good creative theme to it, Dieter Laser absolutely stole the show in that movie. The concept was just disgusting enough to get people interested but in the end it was not as gory/disturbing as people made it up to be.

Now this is where I myself get greatly dissapointed. I think the entire thought process that was taken into creating this movie was to take the biggest complaints people who hadn't seen the movie was, and build upon that. There is no real plot, nothing was done creatively to add depth as to why Martin was kidnapping these people and turning them into the centipede, other than he was sexually aroused by the first film and that he just wanted to.

The climax of the movie is a 15 minute sequence of people defecating in each others mouths and ralphing in each others anuses. Thats the movie in a nutshell. I really wanted this movie to even be half the movie the first one was. It fell very, very short.",1329868800,8,1013,4.354497354497354
4866298,5,B005S9EHL6,"Ever hear of ""The Aristocrats"" joke? They even made a documentary on it. It's about a family auditioning for a stage act, and it's basically an exercise in improvisation on the part of the teller to see just how offensively explicitly obscenely over the top flat out revoltingly gross that audition can be. Many have had a crack at it, some with considerable talent, and the results have been interesting for those who can appreciate that type of thing.

The sub-genre of torture porn in horror films seems to be following a trend comparable to ""The Arostocrats"", and if it continues, it's probably going to burn itself out in unintentional self-parody. Some would argue that this point has already been reached, and they may be right, although it's hard to say. What people find disturbing is highly subjective. If you had asked me two months ago which film I would personally classify as ""most disturbing"", it would have likely been ""A Serbian Film"". The title holder prior to that would have been ""August Underground Mordum"", which held that dubious honor for seven years. Now ""Human Centipede 2"" comes along and slams ""A Serbian Film"" into the sewer a mere two months later. Horror certainly has gotten edgier these days. In any case, Tom Six is a director with some talent, and I think this one's going to be talked about for awhile. It certainly helps that the movie's villain is without a doubt the CREEPIEST character I've ever seen.

Anyway, if extreme horror is your thing, go for it. To date, I think it's the best of the lot. Or worst, considering how you look at it. 99.9% would say it's fit only for burning, and it would be difficult to argue the point. Why this type of thing appeals to me, I really can't say. But it does, and this one freaked me right the &!@# out.",1329868800,55,1783,4.60377358490566

There is a strong similarity to David Lynch's EraserHead as it is fimled in black and white. The relationship between Martin and his mother is so pathetic and hopeless.  Martin is the sick man who creates the human centipede. His entire life is just so dark and gloomy the dread is so believable.

I must praise the American censors for releasing this film in it's complete uncut and uncensored version. The British and Australian censors banned the release of the film in England and Austrailia during it's initial release. The film looks at the darkest reaches of the human mind and evokes the hidden desires of lust, murder, hatred, and emotional pain which all people have had once or more in their lives. In a clever (in your face) kind of way we are lead down the rabbit hole and shown how a human monster, in the character of Martin, is created by life's circumstances. This is real life. Human monsters do exist and often they are people of status and/or of material comforts. Tom and Ilona Six enjoys showing what can happen when people give in completely to the Seven Deadly Sins and transforms into something much less than human.

The first film -- something of an instant cult favorite, even if it made pennies at the box office -- seemed to have fully explored its central premise, so what could Six do to up the ante? This time around, he goes with the meta commentary, focusing on a disturbed, overweight parking garage attendant named Martin Lomax who's obsessed with the first Human Centipede film. Eventually, Martin decides to recreate the experiment therein portrayed, and what ensues is a brutal, graphic depiction of his efforts. The Human Centipede II: Full Sequence is so over the top that I simply got tired of it and felt the weak attempt at social commentary was undone by its own boundary-pushing. Nevertheless, the improvement in technical skill over the first film at least holds some merit.",1329177600,5,971,4.926829268292683

Keep in mind, I'm a Clive Barker and Scott Sigler fan, so the truly violent and grotesque is what I eat for breakfast. This movie? This movie put them all to shame. It made the first Human Centipede seem like child's play. I was physically ill and my sense of common human decency was attacked on every level. The mindless brutality, the profane indifference to human suffering, and the utter lack of a fracking point to it all was offensive and intriguing all at the same time.

This movie should be watched as a challenge between friends. Who can watch it the longest without demanding that it be turned off. Be warned, the friend of yours that's grinning like an idiot at the end of the movie should be shunned.",1328832000,2,794,4.401360544217687

4866377,3,B005S9EHL6,"Hc2 is graphic and nuts.  It pushes the limits of what can be done on film.  I've never seen anything like it.  I first heard about hc one watched it, and was also shocked.  But this takes it ten times further.  The main actor doesn't say a word in the whole movie, yet his facial expressions and body language say he's mentally ill.  It's a well acted movie by all people.  But I think this is designed to gross you out and not so much tell a story.  I mean the story is making a human centipede, but that's all the story you're gonna get.

Like a previous review I read, its certainly not a nice film to watch, but also cannot be ignored.  I sought out the movie, so its my own fault that I watched.  For the other, oh, 90% of the population, you'll probably not seek out this movie.  It'll be mentioned to you by somewhere else, and you probably won't watch it.  But you will hear about it, so either way, it'll be hard to dismiss it.  I give a overall three stars because with these movies, I don't want to run around saying its my new favorite movie.  At the same time, Tom six has big cahones for successfully making a movie ill never forget and that will be talked about for a long time.  I walk away from this movie only watching it once, having the guts to do it, and giving in to my curiosity.  When part three comes out, ill most likely watch it once as well because at this point, how much more gross can it get?  Tom six will probably achieve that too...",1328400000,5,1467,4.123674911660777

4866429,5,B005S9EHL6,"This is one of my all-time favorite children's books. One sunny day, a caterpillar pops out of an egg. He is very hungry and begins searching for food. Now, many of Eric Carle's books have gimmicks--the tactile web in THE VERY BUSY SPIDER and the chirping in THE VERY QUIET CRICKET, for example. The gimmick in this book is that the caterpillar eats holes through all the food, holes that are actually punched into the pages of the book. It's a good gimmick, actually. Also, many of Carle's books teach conventions--telling time in THE VERY GROUCHY LADYBUG and animal sounds in THE VERY BUSY SPIDER, for example. This one teaches the days of the week. On Monday, the caterpillar eats this, on Tuesday he eats that, and so forth. Very cute. Eventually, he becomes a fat caterpillar. He then spins himself a cocoon, where he rests for two weeks. And when he emerges...well, you can guess the results. It's a wonderful story. Best of all, the text is very simple as are the illustrations, so the book will appeal to toddlers as well as the pre-K and kindergarten crowd. In fact, it may appeal more to toddlers, because the story is so very simple. I know I read it as a kindergartener. I loved the holes but found the story rather boring. I read it to my two-year-old this spring, however, and he went nuts over it. The days of the week were lost on him, but he was fascinated by the caterpillar turning into a butterfly--he had no idea! Can't tell you how many times we read it. We also re-enacted it, crawling on the floor and eating, spinning ourselves into cocoons, and popping out with fluttery wings. In fact, he was so taken with the caterpillar-to-butterfly phenomenon that I ordered some caterpillars (I used ""Insect Lore""--they are on-line--but I'm sure there are lots of other places to get them). We read THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR at each stage of their development and then right before we released them as butterflies. It was the highlight of our spring.",1327276800,7,1967,4.638968481375358
4866430,3,B005S9EHL6,"In 2010 writer/director Tom Six unveiled The Human Centipede (First Sequence), a horror film with a plot so outlandish, so vulgar that it got a lot more attention than a typical low-budget, small release horror film. Six immediately promised a sequel, divulging little detail about it except that the first film would be ""My Little Pony compared with part two."" The first Human Centipede, promoted as ""100% medically accurate,"" was remarkably tame and tastefully done considering the extreme subject matter, the brunt of its cultural impact coming from the premise rather than the execution. The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) substantially ups the ante, going so far as to promoted it as ""100% medically inaccurate."" With the film being banned in the UK until 32 cuts were made, Six proved himself an honest filmmaker who truly delivered on his promise. What's scary is that a third film is already planned and he has said it will make this installment look like a Disney film. Discussing a film like this is not easy, because The Human Centipede is a film you enjoy the same way you enjoy a freeway car accident. There's nothing redeeming, entertaining, or significant about it, but it's hard to take your eyes off of it. These films fall into their own niche of ""shock horror,"" horror films that don't intend to evoke fear but shock and disgust. Despite the decided lack of artistic value, I do enjoy seeing filmmakers push the limits of a genre and make something as extreme as possible. While the fact that someone not only had this idea but actually immortalized it on film may destroy any lingering faith you have in the human race, it's an admirable effort that, despite being soulless and demoralizing, accomplishes its intended goal.

Opening with the final scene of the first film, the camera pans back to reveal it being watched on a laptop in a parking garage tollbooth. The viewer is Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), a stout, bug-eyed, asthmatic British man who watches the first film obsessively at every opportunity, has a scrapbook dedicated to it, and even has a pet centipede. His extraordinarily creepy childlike appearance and demeanor coupled with this obsession make it quite clear that Martin is mentally ill. It's revealed that Martin, who never speaks a word in the film, was sexually abused by his father as a child and lives with a mother (Vivien Bridson) who blames him for getting her beloved husband sent to prison. Frequently alone in the parking garage at night, Martin uses this solitude to start attacking and kidnapping people. After gaining access to a warehouse, he begins storing those he has kidnapped with the intention of recreating the human centipede in the film he so loves...But, there's a twist. Martin wants to create a human centipede with 12 people.

This film goes into some of the dark, unheard of places and Six's decision to pull the story into the realm of reality adds an extra level of horror to the happenings. Unfolding in stark black and white (although originally shot in color), this film is cut from a different cloth than the first. The tone and atmosphere, as well as the gratuity and fearlessness, recall the films of German director Jrg Buttgereit, particularly Nekromantik and Schramm, while the black and white imagery and haunting use of silence is reminiscent of David Lynch's Eraserhead. It's easy to dismiss artistic credibility when it's utilized within the torture porn genre, as even torture porn that attempts to be artistic is still just torture porn. While some may (and have) called it artless, Six is a capable director. There are scenes that don't involve violence or gore that are both effective and eerie, but if Six's ability is ignored it's his fault for making such a no-holds barred film. Nothing is off-limits in The Human Centipede II, with even pregnant women and newborns falling victim to the horrific violence. Six is a director gleefully free of pretense and for all of the artistic intentions it appears to have, it never takes itself too seriously. Despite how staggeringly violent it becomes, it's pretty tongue-in-cheek. When Martin actually lures Ashlynn Yennie, the actress who played 1/3 of the centipede in First Sequence, to his warehouse under the guise that she's auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino movie, it's clear that that this film, as well as being horrifically violent, is self-aware. It's easy to forget that the idea of sewing people mouth-to-anus is a rather ludicrous premise and that Six has made it the horrifying premise of two films rather and kept it from being unintentionally funny is an accomplishment in and of itself.

The final 30 minutes will make you realize how conservative the first film was, with Six taking everything as far as his imagination will allow. All of the disgusting elements that were only alluded to are allowed to come to light. He holds nothing back, allowing his potent mix of the horrifying and lack of seriousness to collide when he finally allows a single color, the color brown, to enter the palette. You must recall that the procedure in the first film was performed by a surgeon, with the tools and ability to perform this procedure. Martin is no surgeon and when the time finally comes for him to make his own centipede he uses whatever tools are on hand (hammer, knife, staple gun, etc.). Needless to say, the procedure is much more crude and stomach-churning. Many scenes made me squirm and there are images that will stay with you for a long time after the film has ended; this is not a film for the faint of heart.

I regrettably confirm that this is not the most disgusting, depraved film I've ever seen, but for the average moviegoer it probably will be. How can you critique a film of this sort? It's immune to criticism as there's no way to simply point out the good and the bad. Even the most ardent fan can't ignore that this is a piece of filmmaking with no substance behind it. The Human Centipede II does not function under the faade of a metaphorical social statement in the way last year's A Serbian Film did nor does it even try to make up a reason for its existence. If you look beneath the depravity of the film you'll find only more depravity. In that sense, this is a soulless, obscene, and trashy film. Yes, the acting is solid and say what you will about the film itself, Harvey gives a chilling, effective performance. It's well-made except for some jumpy editing, sound effects that seem out of sync with what is shown onscreen (pay particularly close attention whenever Martin uses his gun on someone), and an ending that is disturbingly ambiguous but also feels like a cop out. There may not be a reason for its existence, but Six has made the film with the intention of shaking his audience. If you make a film with the sole intention of making your audience nauseous and you succeed, how can the work be dismissed solely because it offends your moral and cinematic sensibilities? Six has not made a ""good film"" here, but he has made a well-made one that succeeds in exactly the area it intends. Those who will be most offended by it will be those who haven't seen it and those who are forced to watch it. If you consciously embark on the journey, you know where it's going to take you.

It's rare that a film makes you feel unclean just watching it. The effects this film could have on your psychological well-being and how effectively it offends all sense of moral decency is something that can't be ignored. This film is a success when looked at in that light. This is not a movie you like or dislike; it's a movie that simply exists and it's your decision to choose how you cope with its existence, be it by watching it or ignoring it. At its most primordial level, it's effective in its desire to offend. It's certainly unforgettable. The need to assign this film a rating has pushed me into a corner, confused on how to choose something which will be looked at as indicative over whether it's a good film or a bad film. With a sigh, I give The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) a 3/5 and throw up my hands.",1325808000,201,8099,4.724893917963225
4866431,3,B005S9EHL6,"""The Human Centipede II"" opens with the final moments of ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"", including the closing credits. The camera pulls back, to reveal that this is playing on a laptop computer, and a man in a toll booth in a parking garage is watching the film. Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is an asthmatic, overweight, mentally ill, middle-aged, short British man. He lives in a small flat with his emotionally abusive mother (Vivien Bridson) while working as a security guard in an underground parking garage. His neighbours play Hard Dance music at high levels all night and day, and Martin often spies on the rich individuals who use the parking garage. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens) suspects that Martin was sexually abused repeatedly by his father, now in prison (a suspicion confirmed when Martin has a flashback to this abuse, in which the audience hears the father [voiced by Tom Six] raping his son).

Martin is obsessed with ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"", watching it repeatedly at home and in his toll booth. At one point, he is depicted masturbating (graphically and on-screen) to the film with sandpaper wrapped around his penis. He keeps a centipede as a pet, and maintains a scrapbook on the film. When his mother destroys the scrapbook, Martin crushes her skull and then props her dead body up at the kitchen table. Martin wordlessly decides to recreate the fictional experiment he saw portrayed in The Human Centipede (First Sequence). Medically untrained, he assembles a potpourri of kitchen gadgets, woodworking tools, and assorted household items, puts them in a suitcase, and secures a dingy, dirty, dark abandoned warehouse to recreate the film's medical experiment. But Martin intends to create not just a three-person centipede, but the ""full sequence"" of 12 connected people.

How do you review a film like ""Human Centipede II""? It is one of the most vile, reprehensible, and ugly horror movies that I have ever seen? You want broken teeth, crushed babies, and explosive diarrhea? It's all here. This is a film that completely succeeds in what it wants to do - gross out its small but intensive audience - and will do anything in its power to achieve it. Stylish and incredibly well made with some nice artistic touches here and there - I especially liked the ""dinner table"" scene. Nonetheless, none of this really adds up to very much which is a shame considering that Syx is a talented director with a lot more to offer. Overall, I can't really recommend this film but I can't recommend that you don't see it either. Does that make any sense? This film exists in its own little world and there is something kind of special about that.",1325721600,58,2684,4.896703296703297

Excellent, but very grotesque film. I think it is hard to top any original movie with a sequel. Sequence two for me did not live up to sequence one. It was just as graphic as the first, but to me the second seemed dragged out and the story line just was not there.

The anticipation for #2 was extreme. I read and reread all these reviews and eagerly spent my money. Sorry to say it was not all I had been led to believe I'd see.

I agree with a previous reviewer that Hostel 2 tops the best movie list. I remember the first time I saw Pulp Fiction. Alone! Remember reacting to Alien in the theather? John Carpenter's The Thing? Saw 1? These movies are some of the very few to ever make me really suck wind in OMFG I don't believe it wild eyed awe. We also recommend highly Dee Snider in Strangeland. Surprisingly good movie. A store clerk recommended Wolf Creek and I really like that one. HC1 is in this group but HC2 is not. The 'banned in the UK theme' has boosted interest and sales everywhere else, but it is only a sales hype tsunami that's very obvious and laughable after you've seen the movie. There is absolutely nothing that we can see that rates being 'banned.' Uncountable horror movies with more gore and killing, etc! The pregnant lady who freaks out, gets loose and escapes was a very WTF scene. Didn't care for the B/W. But it does remind me some of Eraserhead, huh? An EASY way to avoid the clarity and reality of #1. The Doctor was 'brilliant' and insane but he had the ability to achieve the joining of them medically. Martin delivering too much blunt force head trauma when it wasn't needed and killing a few of his captives quickly is incapable of scaring you like the look on Girl #2's face when she's sewn in between two dead people, surrounded by other dead people and realizes she's alone, huh?!!

So save your money, folks. I would love to have my $6.99 back. Wait till it's released in February. You'll be able to get it on ebay for PENNIES, I'm sure. Oh, yeah, Netflix will have it, too. :)

The first being Human Centipede I. Let's just say DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN UNDER 16 SEE THIS FILM AND DO NOT EAT WHILE WATCHING THIS FILM. You made need a barf bag because the gross content is that high. On a scale of extremities, it's beyond 100. The main character of this film does not utter a word throughout the whole hour and twenty-seven minutes of this movie except for the occassional snort, giggle and cry. The film is also in black and white which is great because in color would be just too much for viewers to handle. I've had heard that Dario Argento films are extreme which I've never seen and this film would probably be in the same company. It's true what they say, CURIOUSITY DOES KILL THE CAT and I took the bait because Human Centipede I is mild compared to this one and I just had to see the second one. This film was also banned in the U.K. which explains how extreme it is. I guess here in America we are too desensitized to violence. I will say I did like this film and rated it a 4 out of 5 because two things in the movie just didn't realistically sit right with me. How does a parking attendant work everyday and no other worker comes to relieve him or notices the blood in the garage? Also being an asthmatic as is the main character in the movie, How is one able to physically get the bodies he needs, clean up the blood, perform his little surgeries for which he has no experience without passing out. Yes, you see him huff and puff his way through the movie but he should have been almost dead trying to create his 12 person centipede. The other unrealistic thing is he should have been caught and if you've seen the movie, you know why unless there is works for another sequel.

Not that this film pulls any punches. I think as other reviewers have stated it does go to a cheesy level to some degree. But then on the flip side, the actor they found to play Martin works masterfully well. This guy takes creep to a whole new level. You actually start to wonder if this is an actor playing a role or if this guy is actually this seriously disturbed in real life. What makes his performance more perplexing is the fact he does not utter one line in the whole movie, but is able to convey the fact his character is one seriously messed up individual. As far as the ending, I want to throw out one possibility. The viewer is led to believe that he tried his expirament and then went back to his job like nothing happened, which is possible. I, though, took the ending slighly differently, in that as they cut back to the parking garage, he is back watching the movie, and I can possibly assume this was all in the guys head. Yes still seriously obsessed with the film, but the events you witness are really his perverse imagination. It is possible, the ending does not really shed light one way or another, but it can be left to the viewer to make that ultimate decision.

Mostly because of absolutely unnerving performance by Dieter Laser as the sickeningly twisted Dr. Hieter. However, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) isn't so lucky. Here the antagonist is a voiceless, sort of creepy looking rotund fan of the first film. He never utters a word throughout the whole film. At most his utterances are some weird impression of Danny Devito's grunts as Penguin in Batman Returns. The violence is overblown, what dialogue there is is trite and meaningless, lending nothing whatsoever to the plot.

I understand there is a market for these kinds of ""violence purely for the sake of violence"" films but even most of those attempt at some level to have a reasonable plot, or some kind of point. The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) attempts none of this. All throughout the first two acts any viewer with half a brain will wonder how on earth the antagonist is actually getting away with collecting any of his victims. This is just the tip of the iceberg that represents the inherent flaws in the film.

The ambiguous ending, which suggests that the entire film is merely the antagonists fantasy playing out while he masturbates, comes far out of left field and like the majority of the film rings hollow and empty and disgusting.",1320537600,7,1376,4.851063829787234

Two of his victims die prior to this happening, so he is left with only ten.  There's a scene where one of his victims who is pregnant (assumed already dead), is alive and manages to escape.  She gives birth in the footwell of an automobile.  The scene is not gross at all.  It does show the baby sliding into the footwell.  It appears the baby gets in the way of the gas pedal and the skull is crushed by the mother's foot.  This is shown so fast that it's less than disturbing and certainly not as gorey as it is being portrayed in some reviews.

The relationship between Martin and his mother should have been developed more.  From what is on screen, it is assumed she is already totally fed up with him and his obsession with The Human Centipede movie. I would have liked to see more of his dual identity explored more as well.  Martin does not speak in the film.  There's no development of his personality as this may portray his deep isolation from the outside world and his disconnection with reality resulting in he objectifying the first film as something real.

In short, I walked away from the film unscathed.  I felt more disgust from the first one and that impressed me more than this second installment.  See this to see what all the hype is all about.  This film is being marketed more on its gore-factor than anything else and I believe it's misleading.

People who call this film, ""sick"" are most likely referring to the act of ""mouth to ass"" bonding.  It is sick if it were done in reality.  It's a film.  It's fiction and movies are to be watched with a little glimmer in the back of your mind that what you're watching is not real.  In some ways, it's a twist on art in a macabre sort of way.  The ending is also interpretational.  I look at it as a director pushing boundaries and making the audience think while being disturbed.  It makes one think about who will get too close to them in a parking garage at night the next time they go to their car.",1320364800,3,2418,4.3467561521252795
4866599,5,B005S9EHL6,"In my 37 years of living, I have not once came across a single movie that was able to capture my attention as the ""Human Centipede"" has. During the ""Human Centipede"" I found it quite interesting with its quite peculiar plot. Since then I have been consulting with about a dozen medical experts about the idea of a single digestive tract made of three different people. I have become what some would say ""obsessed"" with the idea. Well this obsession has been eating away at me until this came out. I can say before that the ""Human Centipede: First Sequence"" had gotten me very sexually aroused by the idea of this. When I first saw the ""Human Centipede 2: Final Sequence"" I had never had my sperm count so low. This movie had literally saved my life. The sexual tension I had before was slowly killing me. This is the story of Martin who is a security guard who watches ""The Human Centipede: First Sequence"" and become sexually aroused, much like me. But Martin is much more violent. Well without ruining the movie for you I can just say this. YOU WILL NEVER FIND A MOVIE AS GOOD AS THIS. And for only $6!!! This is a no brainer, if you're on the edge of if you should buy it or not because of its graphic content, let me just say that you will not regret it! This I believe is the censored version seen in the UK where it was originally banned for it gruesome content. This is easily the best purchase i've made in the past 6 months.",1320278400,4,1433,4.311111111111111

4866601,4,B005S9EHL6,"I haven't had this much anticipation built up over a movie in along time, well the wait was finally over as I sat down to watch ""The Human Centipede 2"" (Full Sequence). If you saw part 1 and were disgusted by it than I don't know what to tell you except do not watch part 2! Full Sequence takes everything to thee extreme and pushes all its limits, if you want to see peoples teeth getting smashed out by a hammer no problem, knees cut open and ligaments cut got that, people stapled together mouth to anus, watch this movie.

The movies almost a hour and a half long which sucks, it had me drawn in and by the time I knew it, it was over leaving me wanting more. At no time was I bored with it, I loved every minute of it I just wish it was longer. A few things I didn't like were the baby scene which I think was kind of stupid and how towards the end when Ashlynn hit Martin in the crotch than did what she did (I don't wanna give to much away) I think was a little unbelievable. This movie was actually fun, gross, comedic and disturbing all at the same time, which is what I think Mr. Six wanted.

If you do decide to watch this just remember its not perfect but just a movie made to scare you, gross you out, make you laugh, make you feel pity but most of all its made to ENTERTAIN you which it does very well.",1320105600,8,1316,4.0
4866602,4,B005S9EHL6,"I saw this movie with my friends on the day before Halloween, and I guess the atmosphere helped. The film is about a mentally deranged man named Martin (Laurence Harvey, in a surprisingly good performance) who is obsessed with the the first Human Centipede. He then decides to kidnap 12 people to make his own centipede. Obviously, he isn't a doctor, so he has to use what he has at hand: hammers, staple guns, and scissors. There's the plot. On to the violence. Sure, Human Centipede 2 is gross. But it isn't so gross that it should be banned or get the reputation it has. All 4 of us unanimously agreed that the film wasn't that disgusting (Me and a friend were actually underwhelmed by the gore in the film.) If you're a gorehound, I guess you should at least check it out. If you're looking for a film to show on Halloween or around then, try this.

The acting was also OK, at least for the standards set by the plot. The story's alright, and the conclusion is interesting.

Overall, OK. Definitely an improvement over the honestly boring first film.",1320019200,5,1054,4.513089005235602
4866603,3,B005S9EHL6,"Some Spoilers!!!

The first film really shocked me and this new one did the same. It just GROSS ME OUT! The main star, Martin, is this old fat mommy's boy. He was sexually abused before and is somewhat retarded. He is in love with the movie ""The Human Centipede"" and watches over and over again. He wants to make his own human centipede, but better.

In the first film you see 3 people connected and in the second film, you see 10 people connected. The second film is in black and white, so in some way, is a bit more scary than color. This movie showed me more nasty and gross stuff for the actual operation, when the people were being connected together. You don't see that in the first film and it is left for you to picture it, but not here. You do see it! Also, seeing the people poop into each other will disgust you out.

The ending was somewhat disappointing because I didn't know how he got away with it. I would think that he would get caught and go to jail. I would think the police will figured out who killed all those missing people. I will think that the one victim that lived and got away will get the guy caught. Well, none of that happened and he got away with it. The end.

If you want to be scared than this isn't really your movie. But, if you want to be gross out. You need to watch this movie.",1319932800,2,1316,4.12890625
4866604,2,B005S9EHL6,"Once again the extreme negativity that reviewers are giving this film is going to generate alot of interest (or, curiosity as it may be) for this sequel (actually more of a follow-up...). I can say however, I personally find that the decision to film in B & W totally works against this film as since I knew what I was going into from the get go I would much rather have seen the proceedings in color. Let's get this out of the way also...I'm not a psycho, degenerate, and I certainly don't need the powers that be flagging me for a film I choose to view...Ha, Ha, come on now, Look at what's happening around you in this world and tell me that those who choose to view a certain type of film (YES, there ARE exceptions that we won't get into) need's big brother interference...please, will I still have my choice of slurpee flavor at the concession stand in the next year or so? Yes, there's certainly a fair share of naughty business that splashes on the screen through out, but there's many more out there that are way more graphic. Again, if this had been released in color, we'd be viewing a film with 10x the impact that you get as it is. Essentially, as with anything you do, know what you're getting into before you take the plunge. I highly doubt anyone would accidentally find themselves watching this film and then proceed to continue watching it for the next hour and then follow up the experience with a scathing review. I, personally, would have rated it higher but I hated the B & W concept and being that I'm a huge fan of the horror film genre I know what I'm getting into before I viewed this or ANY other film. That way, there's no surprises for anyone. Yes, it's not going to EVER be anyones favorite film, and the lead is so scuzzy and overall disgusting you may just get sick of the long repeated viewing of his sweaty nasty self, but it's what this film IS trying to accomplish and it succeeds very well. There now, you know what you're getting into...choose wisely. Aw ok...3-1/2 stars.",1319846400,4,2010,4.420485175202156
4866605,3,B005S9EHL6,"The Human Centipede (First Sequence) was an extremely disturbing movie.  Its [questionable] premise of being ""100% medically accurate"" made the movie all the more terrifying.  Whether or not that accuracy claim was true, the movie was presented in a way that made it SEEM possible, and that's why the first Human Centipede worked so well.  In The Human Centipede 2, director Tom Six just wanted to make a gorier version of the first film.  The end result is, in my opinion, not quite as effective.

The premise of this second film is actually pretty good.  A mentally ill outcast is a huge fan of the first film and it inspires him to create his own human centipede.  So for the first hour or so the film chronicles his life with is overbearing mother and the gathering of all his victims for the construction of said centipede.  The film's climax involves this man actually building the centipede, and that's when it's no holds barred for the director.  We get to see, very graphically, the removal of teeth, the severing of the kneecap tendons and the general mutilation of the human body.  However, it's shown so explicitly that after a while it's just cheesy.  Moreover, the first film only had three victims, two of which were given a bit of background before the horror started.  In this film, there are 12 people in this centipede.  The only ones you really get to ""know"" are pretty horrible people in the first place.  The rest only get a minute or two of exposition before they're rounded up, so you essentially have zero investment in the people being victimized.  So when you put it all together, it's just gore for the sake of gore.

Kudos, however, to Tom Six for trying really hard to shock us.  The film is rather expertly presented in black and white, giving it the look of a kind of snuff film.  This mechanic really works here, and I couldn't possibly imagine this film being shown in full color (actually, brown is the only color shown...if you've seen the first film you can imagine what it's used for).  The antagonist, Martin, is played immaculately by the actor.  He is chilling, disturbed and incredibly creepy.  The victims do their job well, and having Ashlynn Yennie, who played the center segment of the centipede in the first film, is a bit amusing playing herself here.  In my opinion, the film was well-casted and everyone was giving it their all.

Is this a good movie?  I'd say yes.  If you saw and liked the first film, then I definitely recommend this second one.  Just don't expect to feel the same desperation and suspense you got from part one.  Do expect to be shocked and awestruck in horror at the visuals during the 10-15 minutes of ""centipede construction"".  If you found the first film too much for you, then stay far away...this one goes places few films have gone before.",1319846400,7,2817,4.636363636363637

8484645,1,B005S9EHL6,"Let me start off with a simple recommendation for prospective buyers, please do not purchase this movie. It is simply a waste of the capital you have so earned rightfully. This movie is worthless and a pathetic excuse for entertainment. It's essentially riding on the coat tails of the first movie, but trying to up the ante with more blood and crappy acting. Main character doesn't talk, useless gore, and lack of any story plot to it all makes watching this unbearable. The use of a black and white filter for the entire film is pointless. The dialogue is minimal and worthless.
  When people decide to watch a film, they want to be entertained and they want to be lost within the film. For the amount paid for this movie, people not only have been robbed of those minutes of life, but of their well earned capital as well. Film is meant to inspire people and help them think of a new way to see the world and situations. With this film, there isn't any depth to the gore, the dialogue, nudity, obsession with violence, and black and white filming. There was potential, but sadly, all that money was wasted on this worthless film.
