4492998,5,B004X8VQJO,"Bottom Line: you definitely want this blu-ray version if you're fan or this movie, or if you're an Asian cinephile with a good TV and surround sound.

Yes, I know this is expensive, but this is because it's an import from Japan, since there's no US distributor.  CDs, Blu-rays and the like are quite expensive for reasons that are beyond this review, and IIRC the cost is around $80-100 US equivalent if you buy it in Tokyo (which is not at all out of line for a one-disc movie/CD in Japan - they're expensive!!!).  But it's definitely worth it for two demographics:

1. fans of the movie: you like this movie in the first place, get this.  The mastering and HD presentation on this is light years better than the previous US DVD set.  Colors, resolution, clarity, contrast are excellent on my so-so TV set.  This makes the beauty of the animation stand out.  Likewise, the sound is a set better if you have a decent surround system (but the lossy dolby soundtrack on the US DVD set was pretty good).

2. Asian cinephiles: one of my favorite Samurai type movies - if you appreciate this genre enough to seek out releases that don't have wide distribution outside of Japan (I do for many foreign movies, especially Asian movies) definitely get this.  Conceptually/philosophically, this is as good IMO as anything else of the genre.  Cinematography is excellent, though there are lots of subtle visual cues that only those who really know Japanese culture will fully understand.  The dramatic flow and plot line are also quite well done.  It's had a lot of re-watch value for me.

Notes:
- contains both Japanese and English subtitle and soundtrack options.  Japanese soundtrack with subtitles is the way to go.

- Only criticism I have of this is that since they used the four-episode OVA format (good) they kept the now redundant credits at the end of each episode (a bit odd) and instead of having credits after Kenshin gives up the sword (like in the OVA and movie version) they the credits roll after he burns the house and the scene shifts to Kyoto's Daimonji-yama (bad and annoying but by no means a deal breaker).",1342137600,2,2119,4.655913978494624
4492999,5,B004X8VQJO,Excellent service. I got the OVA on time. This is the blue ray version of Rurouni Kenshin OVA -Trust & Betrayal with english subtitle and it's free region. This the best ver. ever.,1335657600,2,180,4.484848484848484
4493000,5,B004X8VQJO,"This Blu-ray DVD was released as a special edition for the 15th Anniversary of Rurouni Kenshin, and would be great for any fan of the anime or manga. Being a long time fan of both myself, and still considering the series a favorite, I of course wanted to own it. I was not disappointed with my purchase. However, although beautifully done, I did feel the price was a bit steep for what you get (4 episodes and a manual about the main characters and story and an interview with the director). As a result, I can't recommend this version to anyone who isn't a hardcore fan like myself when there's the significantly cheaper Samurai X DVD set with both Trust and Betrayal as well as Reflections (released separately). There may be some differences in events when you compare the two, and the quality won't be as good, but they're essentially the same.

Also, on a side note, I advise everyone to shop around. Amazons list price for this product is $128.98, which is an insane amount. You can buy this for about half that from other online venders.",1327363200,,1044,4.553191489361702
4493001,5,B004X8VQJO,"If you're wondering whether this release of Rurouni Kenshin is worth it I'd say that depends on a few things. If you're as meticulous as I am and you notice every detail and thing wrong with an anime, or you just want a stunning looking blu ray then get this.

Video 10/10
The video quality on this blu ray is great. I have an old Samsung 630 series tv and this blu ray still looks great. Some instances of where you can see detail are when Tomo's hair shines, when you see the awesome looking reflections on the water at 1:11:54 you can see an almost life like fire burning (no joke it's almost true to life). There's also other detail. The shadows and lighting are perfect as well as the rain.

Audio 10/10
The audio is perfect. sounds like a cherry blossom hitting the water as well as the Japanese and English audio are perfect.

As far as I'm concerned all anime should look this good or better.

See first review for other comments.

And yes this is the directors cut of the Trust and Betrayal movies.",1318636800,2,1007,4.335106382978723

Rurouni Kenshin is my favorite all-time anime/manga franchise. It follows the story of Himura Kenshin, a wandering swordsman, who travels around Japan during the Meiji era and helps those in need. He's a peppy sort of goofball, but possesses unparalleled skill with the sword; a sword, by the way, that as a reverse blade. But before he became the optimistic pacifist most people know him as, back during Bakumatsu (the end of the Tokugawa regime of Japan) he was known as the legendary assassin Hitokiri Battousai. Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku-hen is the remembrance story of the events that ultimately shaped his ideals. Fans of the series, and probably a good majority of anime fans in general, should need no introduction to this tragic and epic tale of a boy who had to learn the hard way of what it means to protect something. In contrast to the much lighter TV series, this Original Video Animation is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum in terms of mood. It's dark, bloody, foreboding, and all kinds of melancholy. Technically, if you haven't seen the series you could just as easily watch these 4 episodes by themselves, but I feel the familiarity of the character (at least up to episode 62 of the series) makes for a much more shocking and poignant transition when it goes from ""campy"" to ""dreary."" Not to mention this story path also follows the manga in terms of linearity (Tokyo arc -- Kyoto arc -- Tsuioku-hen -- Jinchuu arc). There's also a second OVA and movie that follow afterwards with the movie being just out there (taking place during the Kyoto arc, actually) and the second OVA being a total disgrace to the manga, but I'll leave that for another review. Regardless, though, Tsuioku-hen is renowned for its storytelling and characterization (whether you know Kenshin's ""present day"" character or not). It's a story of innocence lost, coming of age, love and tragedy, and the beginnings of what would become one of the highest-renowned shounen franchises in all of anime/manga. Featuring some gorgeous and fluid art and animation by Studio DEEN, a truly sweeping and epic score by Taku Iwasaki, and some masterful voice acting by some great veteran seiyuu, Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku-hen is a classic to this day.

I don't have them, but I remember the quality of the initial R1 DVDs. They were good, but not great. There was a bit of dirt, colors were washed out, the framing had some shake in it, and edge enhancement was fairly obvious. Then they released a director's cut that merged all 4 episodes together to make a movie version, but the aspect ratio was CROPPED into 16:9 of all things. Despite the slightly better video quality that solved about half the problems that plagued the initial single releases, you just shouldn't mess with the original aspect ratio and crop. Thankfully, though, they put a really high amount of effort into mastering this for BD. Back before this edition came out, the official website of the product had a streaming video of one of the producers explaining how they were going about re-master everything. It was a time in the industry where digital animation was starting to evolve and they ended up doing Tsuioku-hen partially on film and partly digital (I'd guesstimate around 90 to 10 in terms of percentage). In scanning the film parts, however, she says they were able to bring out a LOT more detail than they ever thought they could. And the result really shows (back in the original aspect ratio of 1.33:1, no doubt). The first thing I noticed most when I watched this was the coloring. Colors are bold and perfectly saturated really giving the art direction that grittier look apart from the series. Contrast is very balanced helping to reveal a lot of excellent line detail as well. They're sharp, full, and give the characters and backgrounds a lot of texture. In addition, black levels are nearly flawless outside of a speck here or there, though I'd attribute that more to the artwork in general than as a video anomaly like dirt or artifacting. The digital parts of the film are essentially SD upconverts, but they're so short that there's never really any time for them to sink in. The picture overall is so, so smooth in comparison to what I saw on the DVDs. Lines are straight with no aliasing, colors are very vibrant with respective senses of warmth and coldness depending on the point of the story, and I've never seen it look any better. A big thank you to Studio DEEN for doing a remarkable job of re-mastering the video.

It's not often that a sound design for anime has much to offer. Unless they were full feature-length films with really high budgets, most anime just never got a lot of pampering in the sound department. The R1 DVDs offered a measly Dolby Digital 2.0 for both languages during its release. Then the R1 director's cut had lossy 5.1 English and lossy 2.0 Japanese. The R2 Japanese DVD had LPCM 2.0 Japanese and, I believe, lossy 2.0 English. Well, in addition to remastering the video, they also did a stupendous job on the audio. Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku-hen features LPCM 2.0 Japanese, DTS-HD MA 5.1 Japanese, and DTS 2.0 English. Bit rates for each are 1.5Mbps, around 2.8Mbps average, and 477Kbs, respectively. Sound effects play a big part, but are actually used quite sparingly as a result of the action scenes moving so quickly. High and low ends for swords clashing and feet shuffling on the ground are spot-on. However, I was really surprised at the level of separation. Dialogue stays in the center for the most part unless characters are talking off-camera, while music and nature effects are evenly dispersed at an excellent volume between the fronts and rears. In particular, rears do a very good job of reflecting the mood and creating a sort of ambiance with various sounds of cicadas, rainfall, wind blowing, and crowd-goers to make you feel immersed for the given situations. LFEs are there, but are most prevalent via the score. Ah yes, the score. As much as I love Noriyuki Asakura for composing the series' music, Taku Iwasaki brings Kenshin to a whole other level with this one. As I mentioned about the dispersal of music, it is, by far, the driving element of the sound. It sets the mood, moves the story along, and really keeps you tuned in to anything and everything on screen. That being said, I wouldn't say this is reference material compared to a sonic behemoth like Akira or anything, but considering the genre (more so a period drama with a little action instead of an all-out blade fest like Sword of the Stranger), it sounds extremely good for what it's worth thanks in huge part to the score and its emotional effectiveness.

Extras - 2.0

Aside from a trailer, the disc itself doesn't have anything. Instead, this digipak includes two booklets, one in the original Japanese, then another translated into English. The Japanese booklet seems a bit more in-depth by including artwork and sketches to go with character biographies. The English booklet includes translated bios and an interview with series and OVA director Kazuhiro Furuhashi. The interview itself is only a little over a page and talks about some of the nuances in the writing of the OVA, which was actually written while the manga was still being published, and a little bit about how the violence was used as more of a storytelling tool to convey the emotions and ideals of the times. It's not much, and I would've preferred something along the lines of interviews with cast and crew on the disc itself, but oh well.

Overall - 4.5

Regarded as one of THE masterpieces by a good majority of anime fandom, Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku-hen manages to tell a very gripping story within just 4 episodes that essentially is the building block and ongoing legacy of the Kenshin franchise. It's a story that displays strength, philosophy, all the good and bad sides of life, and the fortitude to choose how one lives on past their own tragedy and sadness. The character content for this franchise is intricate and amazingly deep. If you're new to the franchise, I'd recommend watching the TV series from episodes 1-62, watching Tsuioku-hen, then finishing up the last arc with manga volumes 20-28. You could even skip the first season of the anime (episodes 1-28) and just read the Tokyo arc in the manga (volumes 1-6) if you don't want to experience some filler. But whatever you do, if you're a fan of the franchise, do yourself the favor of trying to get a copy of this BD. Tsuioku-hen has never looked or sounded better, and the story itself should more than earn its weight for the money. Hopefully, with the new Shin Kyoto-hen OVA coming out, the franchise might garner enough popularity again to make for either some sort of reboot, or at least a proper production of the Jinchuu arc. Fans.. must.. own this.",1317859200,15,9052,4.77330779054917

4493015,5,B004X8VQJO,"A bit on the pricey side, but well worth it for the hardcore Kenshin fans. Not only a beautiful BD remaster of this classic (seriously, the quality of the video is outstanding) but it comes with an awesome cover art that I wish I had a poster of. My favorite aspect of is that, rather than use the ""Director's Cut"" which merged the four OVAs into one continuous movie, they kept it in the original four OVA format. This, for me, is probably it's best quality as the Director's Cut movie removed or changed critical sound pieces during key moments. By keeping the OVA formats, these awesome sound/action pieces remain the same. Seriously, if you're a Kenshin fan, do yourself a favor, dig into the piggybank, and buy this before it's gone for good.",1445990400,5,747,4.582089552238806

4493022,5,B004X8VQJO,"Loved the TV series while growing up, but never saw this OVA til 2013. Loved every minute of it. This one movie had more violence and sadness than the whole TV series did. And that's one of the reasons why I love it. A very tragic story for Kenshin. I have watched this multiple times because it just doesn't get boring. The only complaint I have is I thought I was getting the limited edition Blu-Ray but it was just the regular. Still happy with the purchase though. Great audio, visuals, and it also has the English dub! The dub ain't perfect but I do think it's very good. The way some lines are delivered and some pronunciations are a little weird. But a good dub nonetheless. And the soundtrack is amazing. This is a must own.
