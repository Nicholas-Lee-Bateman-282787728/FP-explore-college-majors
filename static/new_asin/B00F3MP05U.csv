5966517,5,B00F3MP05U,"I've loved Mama's Family ever since growing up in the 80s! And I think Vicki Lawrence is such a talent - love to watch her!

And I love it when there is a great value: getting two DVD sets (two seasons) in one go! I already knew that when they re-released season 1, pretty much uncut, it was going to be a great product. Of course it's 100 times better than the first issuing! Love the extras too: The extras on season 2 are phenomenal, especially the Vicki and Carol interview!!!

I really hope that the remaining 4 seasons will be released individually and soon! Buying the Time-Life complete series would be more expensive for me because they do not ship internationally and I'd have to bug someone in the states to worry about s+h to Finland :-/ So, as long as the remaining 4 seasons will be available individually (why wouldn't they???) I don't mind waiting!",1381881600,3,864,4.496815286624204

8612036,5,B00F3MP05U,"Mama's Family was my favorite comedy in the eighties. It was unlike anything else on television. The Harpers were loud, obnoxious, flawed and completely dysfunctional. The first two seasons include 35 episodes aired on network television. This edition is completely restored to include Harvey Korman's Alistair Quince ala Alistair Cooke introduce almost all the episodes. The first season included thirteen episodes with Vicki Lawrence as Mama Thelma Crowley Harper; Rue McClanahan as her spinster sister Aunt Fran; Ken Berry as Thelma's youngest son, Vinton; Vint's teenage kids, Buzz and Sonja; and Dorothy Lyman as Naomi Oates Harper who married into the family. Special guest appearances with Betty White as snobby Ellen and Carol Burnett as ornery Eunice Higgins. Harvey Korman played Ed Higgins, Eunice's husband.

Several notable guest appearances included Murray Hamilton ""Mama Cries Uncle;"" William Windom; Yvonne Wilder ""Cellmates;"" Jerry Reed ""Leonard Oates;"" Richard Dawson; Conrad Janis; Fred Willard; Geoffrey Lewis; Earl Boen; Georgeann Johnson; and others. The second season included an NBC special 90 minutes televised play entitled ""Eunice"" with Vicki Lawrence; Carol Burnett; Harvey Korman; Betty White and Ken Berry in the cast. The first and second season DVDs included a retrospective with Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Betty White and Ken Berry and a sketch from the ""Carol Burnett Show"" with Betty White.",1511049600,,1429,5.6157407407407405
