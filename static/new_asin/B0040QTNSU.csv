This is exciting news for Disney fans everywhere, but even better, Disney is including Destino, an animated collaboration between Walt Disney and Salvador Dali.

Disc One: Fantasia Blu-Ray
* DisneyView

* Interactive Art Gallery

For those who have been putting off upgrading to Blu-Ray, this might finally be the incentive for which you've been looking.",1283126400,122,1477,5.032786885245901

4240663,5,B0040QTNSU,"I would like to go on the record by saying that I actually watched Fantasia 2000 first before I ever knew about the first one. It was only when I got older did I watch the first Fantasia. And let me tell you, it was a blast to watch.

Both films provide animated takes on the classic music we usually find boring to make it into something memorable. If you ever want a charming film to watch get this special double pack with the original Fantasia film and Fantasia 2000.",1502236800,,471,4.233333333333333

4240691,5,B0040QTNSU,I am a great fan of Fantasia and have watched it on video tape and DVD many times over the years. I have never seen the technicolor version. The Blue Tooth version of Fantasia is so good it is like seeing it for the first time. The colors pop and there is so much more detail than the analog versions. This must be what it was like to see it at the movie theaters in technicolor.,1460160000,,379,4.0

4240693,4,B0040QTNSU,"The reason I only give this set four stars is because Fantasia 2000 was a bit of a disappointment.  The original Fantasia is still classic, but in 2000 I think they tried too hard and fell short of the mark.  If they had just relaxed and ""let it happen"" like they did in the original, it probably would been a lot better.  However, hindsight is always 20/20, and this just goes to prove it.  At least the music was good.",1454976000,,420,4.2125
4240694,5,B0040QTNSU,Love the original. 2000 is good too but the original is very nostalgic. Took me 2 tries to get a copy that worked but glad I stuck out the return and rebuy process! Crazy to think how old the 1st movie is! (1940's!),1454889600,,215,4.023255813953488

4240702,5,B0040QTNSU,"These were two of my kids' favorite movies when they were growing up, and now are among the most often borrowed from Gramsie's library by the grands.  Too few kids today get the opportunity to listen to plain instrumental music, especially classical.  These movies present the music in such beautiful and creative way that it makes quite an impression.  To this day, ""Pomp and Circumstance"" now calls up images of animals advancing up to the Ark rather than of caps and gowns!",1449619200,2,476,4.780487804878049
4240703,5,B0040QTNSU,"I remember going to the movie theater as a child to see the original Fantasia. MANY years later, I was able to enjoy it on VHS tape. Even my daughter was fascinated with the flying horses & centaurs of the Pastoral segment. I got this 2 disc set because I can no longer watch the original on VHS. I have never seen Fantasia 2000 as a whole movie, just segments on the old Wonderful World of Disney. I'm looking forward to it.

4240719,5,B0040QTNSU,"A masterpiece. This 1940 Disney film called ''Fantasia'' is the kind of movie where talking about it doesn't do it justice, you have to experience it for yourself.

The movie is split into 8 segments, and each of them begins with a narrator describing what we are about to see. Each segment tells a different story, and features different things such as fairies, leaves, flowers, volcanoes, monsters, animals, dinosaurs, and centaurs either dancing to the music, or the characters simply doing things in the story as the music goes on.

My personal favorite segment is the last one called ''Night On Bald Mountain''. This segment is scary and disturbing, and is also beautifully animated. Night On Bald Mountain is about a demon called Chernabog (who is basically the Devil), summoning monsters and evil spirits to dance on the mountain as Chernabog throws flames and casts black magic. As the church bells ring and the sun begins to rise, Chernabog and the spirits go back to sleep. It then ends with monks walking to the ruins of a cathedral while holding torches. The entire segment is a depiction of Good Vs. Evil.

Other segments I loved are the ones with the fairies that is set to The Nutcracker music, and the segment with the Centaurs and Centaurettes.

The movie is amazing. I think everyone should see this movie. It's beautiful, funny, cute, scary and disturbing, trippy, and an amazing experience. Fantasia is a masterpiece, and it is one of the best animated films I've ever seen.",1439683200,3,1494,4.847058823529411

4240808,5,B0040QTNSU,"It had been far too long for me to avoid the superlative four-disc Blu-Ray/DVD edition of ""Fantasia"" and its sequel ""Fantasia 2000"", so I finally went to a CD store and bought the four-disc set for $29.99. And boy, did I ever get my money's worth? Considering that ""Fantasia"" is not only one of the greatest movies of all time, but also one of Walt Disney's own personal favorites, it's no surprise that it continues to be venerated even by non-Disney fans and be preserved righteously without needless refurbishing (**cough**The Sword of the Stone**cough**). Yet words cannot describe just how stunning the movie looks and sounds on the Blu-Ray. If you thought ""Fantasia"" looked great before, wait till you get a load of this.

Everybody knows about the history of ""Fantasia"". After the spectacular success of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Walt Disney conceived a feature that would synchronize classical music with state-of-the-art animation and breathtaking visuals. Collaborating with the great music composer Leopold Stokowski, Disney and his team of artists constructed an anthology of eight animated segments, each set to their respective classical music, and use this anthology as a platform to continue making more experimental cartoons that would push the envelope of what animation could do in the future. The result was ""Fantasia"", a movie that ranks, along with that other masterpiece ""Pinocchio"", as the pinnacle of Disney animation.

Unfortunately, any attempt for ""Fantasia"" to start an animation revolution was permanently thwarted, thanks to WWII cutting off the European market, as well as fans' apathy towards the film's ambitions and scope, which they dismissed as ""highbrow"" and ""pretentious"". Like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Blade Runner"", ""Fantasia"" was the great visionary film that was ahead of its time and took a long time to gain its critical and commercial stature. Even after the 1970s counterculture, of all movements, embraced the movie for its psychedelic colors, ""Fantasia"" continues to polarize moviegoers: some hailed as one of the towering masterpieces of American cinema, others reject it as a grotesque piece of kitsch and a gross example of ""Disneyification"".

But as history has shown, time can heal wounds and turn black coal into gold nuggets and the time has come to re-evaluate ""Fantasia"" as the monumental classic as it is. No matter what your views are, you cannot deny the film's ambition and technical perfections. To this day, no animator or filmmaker has attempted what ""Fantasia"" achieved, not even Pixar or Miyazaki. Its boldness is great enough, but the fact that all the meticulous detail and stunning visuals were done by human hand and that it was done nearly 75 years ago is staggering. The scary part was that Disney was just starting to break newer ground in the animation world and probably would have achieved more if the European markets didn't freeze. Just imagine what Disney could have done had WWII never took place; just thinking about it can produce a chill.

Now after numerous releases, ""Fantasia"" (and its sequel ""Fantasia 2000"") has been released in a format that finally expresses the film's visual and aural power. Don't even think that the ""Fantasia Anthology"" set is as good as ""Fantasia"" will look and sound. As good as the picture and audio were on that set, nothing will prepare you with just how stunning the film looks and sounds on Blu-Ray. There are some movies that are released on Blu-Ray and they fail to demonstrate its dexterity. ""Fantasia"" not only shows what Blu-Rays can do; its shows why they are now a necessity to buy.

Watching ""Fantasia"" on Blu-Ray and the big screen, I finally saw the immense clarity and beautiful detail that wasn't noticeable in the previous versions. Just witness the dazzling colors of ""Toccata and Fugue"" (the sections of this segment where the backgrounds were in complete darkness are now revealed to have had different shadings); the delicate textures of ""The Nutcracker Suite"" (particularly the ""Arabian Dance"" and ""Waltz of the Flowers"" portions); the wondrous effects of ""Rite of Spring""; the rich tapestry of the ""Pastoral Symphony""; the misty quality and subtle touches of ""Ave Maria"" (just look at the art direction where the pilgrims are walking through the cathedral-shaped forest and the trees in the final shot and you'll see details you never saw before); the volcanic riot of demonic imagery on ""Night on Bald Mountain""; the gentle satire of ""Dance of the Hours""; and best of all, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", now looking as timeless as ever. If this is as good as ""Fantasia"" will look, then I am happy for it.

But as stunning as ""Fantasia"" looks, the soundtrack is utterly magnificent. Disney had envisioned ""Fantasia"" to be a spectacular sensory experience where the sound quality was every bit as grandiose as the animation (it was, after all, a precursor to the now common 'Surround Sound' system). Hearing ""Fantasia"" with huge speakers was an exhilarating experience I don't think I'll ever forget; it was equivalent of being in a concert, which is what Disney had originally intended. Stokowski's powerfully dramatic music comes through the speakers like a tidal wave, gripping the audience while enriching the visuals on screen. Visually and aurally, ""Fantasia"" has never been this good.

Sixty years after ""Fantasia""'s original release, Walt's nephew Roy Disney collaborated with a new team of animators and artists to create ""Fantasia 2000"", the overdue sequel that finally achieved Walt's original goal in having a continual release that mixed newer segments with old segments. Out of the eight segments in ""2000"", only one original segment remained (""The Sorcerer's Apprentice""). The seven newer segments were composed of artists who worked on many of the best-loved Disney movies from the ""Disney Renaissance"" era, including ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"". Considering that those were the crown jewels of that illustrious period, you would think ""Fantasia 2000"" would be a worthy equal to ""Fantasia"".

Unfortunately, that is not the case. All the segments are very entertaining and the animation, backgrounds and art direction are absolutely stunning. And the picture and sound quality is just as exceptional as the ones on ""Fantasia"". But most of ""2000"" lacks the bold spirit and fierce imagination of the original. The sole exceptions are the marvelous ""Rhapsody in Blue"", which is a stylistic homage to Al Hirschfeld and the limited animation style of UPA and the majestic ""Firebird Suite"", which successfully merges the themes of the conflict between profane and sacred the same way ""Night on Bald Mountain""/""Ave Maria"" did in the original.

The rest, however, are, for lack of a better term, pedestrian. ""Carnival of the Animals"" is a nice kiddy piece, but it ends just when it gets good. ""Symphony No. 5"", which opens the sequel, feels like a half-hearted retread of ""Toccata and Fugue"". ""Pines of Rome"", with its flying whales, and ""Piano Concerto No. 2"", based on the ""Steadfast Tin Soldier"" by Hans Christen Anderson, are nicely drawn but emotionally bland narratives. The worst segment, however, is ""Pomp and Circumstance"", a Donald Duck segment that bizarrely merges Elger's majestic marches with a Noah's Ark story. Mixing Donald Duck with sentimentality and an ecological message never works and the music sounds hopelessly pompous (no pun intended), with an irritating soprano solo that turns an emotionally powerful composition into saccharine mush.

Nevertheless, ""Fantasia 2000"" is not to be entirely dismissed. Children and young adults will enjoy the film and there are indeed some people who prefer it over the original since it's more accessible and child-friendly. But all the technology and artistry in the world is not enough if your movie is lacking imagination and creativity. Still, Disney deserves praise for putting both films in this edition and releasing it for an appropriate price (at its time at least; now it's expensive to buy), so that anyone can watch both movies and compare and contrast which is better or worse.

Unsurprisingly, the four-disc Blu-Ray set of the ""Fantasia"" films is complete with outstanding bonus features. In addition to the previous supplements on the ""Disney Anthology"" set (which is only available through BD-Live Portal), the Blu-Ray set includes three top-notch commentaries for ""Fantasia"" (including a new one from British historian Brian Sibley) and two for ""Fantasia 2000"", a DisneyView presentation that lets viewers see ""Fantasia"" in its original screen ratio but with custom painting substituting the black bars, two sprawling galleries of interactive art, a brief promo of the Disney Family Museum, envisioned by Walt's beloved daughter Diane Disney Miller who sadly passed away back in December, and, most interesting of all, a documentary on the intriguing collaboration between Disney and Salvador Dali and the short it produced (""Destino"").

The best bonus features, however, are ""The Schultheis Notebook"" and ""Musicana"". The former is an excellent featurette that shows Herman Schultheis keeping notes on how the artists developed special effects and animation techniques on ""Fantasia"" and the latter reveals the ideas towards a potential ""Fantasia"" sequel that never came. These extras show, with heartbreaking realization, just how far Disney wanted to push the envelope before WWII undermined the whole process.

Disney really outdone themselves with this phenomenal set on a phenomenal animated classic and its flawed but entertaining sequel. After all these years of watching ""Fantasia"" in that tolerable ""Anthology"" set, I (and millions of moviegoers) can finally watch ""Fantasia"" as it was intended. At long last, ""Fantasia"" has been restored to its glorious, original state the way it was meant to be. To quote Robert Duvall, it smells like victory.",1400025600,,9929,5.241032095657646

In the Rhapsody in Blue sequence we get the line drawing genius of Al Hirschfeld combined with Gershwin's angular jazz; fantastic concept that one can watch over and over.  That you can get disney's original 1940 movie and the 2000 iteration with all the advancements in animation technology makes this worth buying.

Fantasia 2000 had some brilliant moments that transcended the level of the first movie.  The segment that really stands out is the Steadfast Tin Soldier.  Unfortunately, my BluRay disk came damaged, and I was too lax about getting a replacement, so I can't tell you about some of the pieces that I couldn't see, especially the whales.  (If Disney had collaborated with National Geographic, they could have given us something that was stunning, but big money finds it hard to collaborate, as we all know.)

4240815,5,B0040QTNSU,"I saw Fantasia & Fantasia 2000 for the first time ever today.

Fantasia is a Disney classic, and one of the best films ever made. The so-called racist content has been eliminated, and that's a good thing. In my opinion, the centuarette Sunflower isn't racist, but scary. It's a good thing that she was cut from the film, and unlike other reviews have stated, there's no jump in the audio track (which is fortunate, as the Pastoral Symphony by Beethoven is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever composed, and it would have been unforgivable for there to have been a jump in the audio track). Of course, the most well-known part of Fantasia is The Sorcerer's Apprentice, featuring Mickey Mouse, but there is sooo much more to discover.

Fantasia 2000 is very good, but I have only one complaint: it's too short. The pieces of music chosen for this long-awaited sequel blend perfectly with the images on the screen, and of course, they all tell a complete story, even when the music is just there for its own sake, as Deems Taylor said in the original Fantasia. And of course, The Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence is included, as a nice nod to the original.

The only part that I felt was weak was the introduction to The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

I highly recommend both films.

Didn't bother me, but it made it harder to keep my daughter's attention between segments and eventually I just started skipping the introductions. Other than that it's just as I remembered.

Fantasia 2000 I hadn't seen before and is an interesting revival of the idea. All the segments are good but really none of them have that same truly classic feel to them like the original ones did (with the possible exception of ""Rhapsody in Blue."") That said they're still very well realized, even if they don't feel quite as daring and exciting as the original segments (some even seem to be deliberately trying to recapture the feel of parts of the original, ""Carnival of the Animals"" is trying very hard to rekindle ""Dance of the Hours"" for example.)

4240830,5,B0040QTNSU,"This is the marriage of two art forms, the majesty of the world's best classical/modern instrumental music and the artistry of the walt Disney's resident artists.  This collection includes the theatrical releases of Fantasia (1940) and Fantasia 2000 (2000) is for the serious music lover and animation aficionado.

The original 1940 animated classic features sequences set to music by Bach, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Mussorgsky, Schubert and Beethoven. The film opens with the now-famous 'Sorcerer's Apprentice' routine, in which Mickey Mouse conjures up a troublesome mop when he messes around with a magical wand. This movie still stand up today and brings back memories of a simpler time and artistry.

Fantasia 2000 is an ode to the original film, Fantasia.  It starts withe original film's most famous sequence - the Mickey Mouse adventure 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and seven other all-new animated interpretations of classical music. Among the best is a sequence that features the stories of 1930s New Yorkers accompanied by Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue', a tale of volcanic myth set against Stravinsky's 'Firebird Suite', a comical version of the Noah's Ark story and Elgar's 'Pomp and Circumstance'.

I bought this for my 18 month old daughter and she enjoys it. I think the only people who are going to dislike this are those who are very picky. The video quality is really good and I was watching it on an old SD television from around 2004.",1388620800,,624,4.032258064516129

4240842,4,B0040QTNSU,"Ive had this film in my collection for some time, but never watched it the whole way through before now. I can see why this has been called one of Disneys finest. It certainly does seem to delve more into the essence of art forms, both in film and music. The conductors introductions before each piece can help to explain some of the meaning, but they can also take out some of the interpretation on the part of the viewer. I recognized some pieces Ive already heard before, like Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, and some other pieces I recognized by sound, like the Dance of the Hours (the hello mother, hello father rhyme). My favorite piece was of course, Mickeys performance as the Sorcerers Apprentice, one that I forlornly recall upon every apartment cleaning check. Night on Bald Mountain was also a favored one (though more so in the video game Kingdom Hearts, where you actually get to fight the creature while the music plays), and Ave Maria had a very peaceful air about it. I must say that some of the visual choices for the animation seemed odd, like the music of the Dance of the Hours didn't immediately call to mind ballet-dancing ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators. I will also add that I enjoyed the pieces with discernable plots and stories more than the abstract ones, but I am a writer by trade and stories are our thing.

I had both films, so I thought I would look at both back-to-back, and for the first time with this sequel. While I enjoyed it overall, it didn't seem as profound as the original. Again, I recognized several pieces, including Beethovens Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, and the graduation theme Pomp and Circumstance (though I wouldnt have immediately thought of Donald Duck as Noah while hearing it). The visual choice of a herd of humpback whales that can suddenly fly to Pines of Rome also seems astonishingly random. Many of the pieces adequately represented the emotional feel of the music, though I wouldnt go so far to say as perfectly, but it did sufficiently subscribe to the doctrine of affections in my opinion. In this film, my favorite piece was the Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major by Dmitri Shostakovich, which was set to an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersens The Steadfast Tin Soldier, again because of the story involved and its changed happy ending. I also enjoyed the visual style of Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin, with its look of 1930s cartoons by Al Hirschfeld, and the variety of people and problems shown within. I will admit that I thought the best overall piece, in both sight and sound, was Firebird Suite by Igor Stravinsky. Its flowing visuals were amazing and the ultimately triumphant sound of its ending with the large brass section was inspiring. However, the random celebrity cameo introductions and the complete rehashing of the Sorcerers Apprentice didn't help this film much.",1384732800,,2871,4.730538922155689

I love Fantasia.  This is a classic from the time of hand-drawn animation that will always serve to demonstrate how amazing the soon-to-be-lost art is!  Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is VERY slow for today's short attention span generation.  I must admit, I had difficulty making it all the way through the original Fantasia lately.

Fantasia 2000 is a much shorter film than the original Fantasia.  However, it has much better pacing and does a good job of keeping everyone interested.",1377043200,,663,4.866071428571429
4240862,4,B0040QTNSU,"Probably Disney's most ambitious Animated film gets a nice treatment, but still has the altered centaur sequence. OK,OK already, I hate censorship as much as anybody, but I probably saw the sequence once in my lifetime, in a theater, as a kid. While I wish Disney would release both versions of the film (and the others that have been altered)include full screen and widescreen versions if they were presented in a theater that way, it's probably not going to happen, so since I intend on enjoying the films, I'll buy them regardless of these issues. Life is short folks!

What bothers me most about the edits are where do we draw the line? I'm of Italian/German decent, so maybe I'm offended by Stromboli from Pinocchio? or the way German's are continuously portrayed as Nazis??!  If we look hard enough we can find offense in anything. I understand the need to keep the little ones away from some images to a certain point, but I think we're doing them a great disservice by sugar coating everything! The solution is to release BOTH versions of the films that have been altered and let the purchaser watch the version they want to. Haven't we given Disney enough money buying these films over and over again??!

Ok enough ranting.

Fantasia Disney's 3rd effort gets a first class treatment here looking and sounding remarkable! The film has been restored to 125 minutes and is an important landmark in film and Disney's career. Personally I think Children will be bored to tears with this film, but that is for you to decide. I own the 4 discs Blu Ray/DVD edition but still had to keep my previous 3 disc DVD set because Disney has another irritating practice of leaving out bonus material from previous releases. These negatives aside, this is the version to own, but hold on to the DVD box set if you like the behind the scenes stuff.

The new bonus material is very good though especially the cross bio of Salvador Dali and Walt Disney, it's a little over an hour long and I found it very interesting. There are other new items that are short ,but very good and if the old bonus stuff had been included on this new set of discs(not BD live!)this set would get a 4.9 with the edit being the only blemish.

The two films look spectacular on Blu ray and really jump off the screen. The sound is also much improved. It's a shame that Fantasia 2000 isn't the groundbreaking film it should have been. It's actually very good, but having multiple persons introduce the selections wasn't a great idea, it makes the film feel more like a documentary. The Sorcerer's Apprentice shouldn't have been part of this new continuation either. When Walt first envisioned this being an on going ever changing thing, he didn't have home video in mind. No one wants to watch these films back to back and see the same segments twice? What I find funny is the original Fantasia is 60 years older, but the animation seems much better and groundbreaking even in these times. I think they should have pushed the envelop a little further in this film, it should have been longer and the Salvador Dali piece should have been in it maybe instead of The Sorcerer's Apprentice repeat.",1376438400,,3158,4.630357142857143

 Fantasia 2000 partially lived up to its predeccessor, but there was a few minuses. While it had some wonderful original scenes, Like the Whales in the ""Pines of Rome"" segment and the ""Steadfast Tin Soldier"", ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and the ""Firebird"",they could have done something different and not had a redo of ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"".Also some of the mugging done by a couple of the guest stars was a bit annoying as it wasn't really necessary. In fact, I felt the musical artists should have been the ones to introduce the pieces as there was already comedy involved in some of the works displayed. While the second Fantasia was great,I hope that if another one is ever made,they will do more original material and let the earlier films speak for themselves without filling the spaces of the new film with stuff that was seen before-and let the musical artists speak for the things they do.",1374019200,,1151,4.642156862745098

But several of the scenes were actually frightening to her and when the broomsticks get chopped to pieces by an evil looking, axe wielding Mickey Mouse, she got upset and I shut it off.  It'll sit for several years until she is older and we can explain.

The Noah's Ark sequence may be the most glaring example, but darned if it doesn't bring me close to tears every time.  And while I doubt that any of the pieces in 2000 will become cinematic icons like the Sorceror's Apprentice, I show both movies to anyone I can who hasn't seen them as a clever and often inspiring blend of two art forms that can tell moving stories without words.",1358640000,,637,4.38135593220339

4240914,4,B0040QTNSU,"What today may be looked on as trippy, odd, unconventional and unorthodox was never again replicated. The likes of a beautiful and lavishly animated motion picture with a famed conductor, Leopold Stokowski, at the wheel of the vessel, the production was called Fantasia. Perhaps harder to believe today but this was nothing short of a very special treat for children and adults of the era, having a renowned conductor orchestrate beautiful classical music to some of the prettiest and fantastic scenes in animation history on screen. That was a vision of the man himself Walt Disney, a project that he was quite passionate about.

Walt Disney saw no limit to animation, why should it only be secluded to one specific style or presentation? 1 part comedy, 1 part horror, 1 part drama and all parts eye candy Fantasia is a captivating and entrancing film. Never have music and images fit so perfectly together. This was produced during the best era that traditional animation ever saw, 1935-1949 the Golden Age, and came off the heels of the huge success and first feature length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Because of the financial success of Snow White, 1937, not only was Disney given ultimate freedom in what he could produce, but the success was enough that the Dwarfs built the Walt Disney Studio, literally the studio actually has built in stone all Seven Dwarfs holding up the roof of the building. The best and only way to watch this film, as is with the other Disney Classic titles, is in Blu-Ray.",1356393600,2,1525,4.816793893129771

4240922,3,B0040QTNSU,"Mistake #1:
You may have read that this 1941 film has been modified quite a few times since its debut. Whichever edit this one is, Joseph Deems Taylor's distinctive voice is overdubbed and the orchestra segments have been brightened so that you can see their faces. These scenes are now terribly annoying on the ears, the intended mysterious effect is ruined, and how dare they take it upon themselves to modify the works of the great genius, Walt Disney!!!

Mistake #2:
I grew up with the 1969 edit and it was a huge part of my childhood. They used to show it at the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Show before the Rockettes came out. But in this new edit, the order of the sequences have been changed and now have a way of making this great film a bit boring, especially for a child. Everyone knows that for most kids, the most beloved sequences are the Dinosaurs, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and A Night On Bald Hill. But this one positions the first two in a way that makes the film drag.

Mistake #3: Here is my 2 cents on Sunflower...
Get over it. The Sunflower scene was a nod to ""Farina"" from ""The Little Rascals"", a beloved character in those days. It was a silly little scene, I wouldn't miss it if wasn't there, but the crime is that I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE! That was taken away from me by certain people with gigantic chips on their shoulders because Sunflower had a goofy teeth, pickaninny hair and was in a service postion (something black activist groups want to pretend never happened). It's 2013 and I see this real-life character every time a walk into a McDonalds. There were also a few black centaurs in the background of this scene which were later removed, but they should feel lucky that there were ANY black characters in it at all! If there were none, today you would be hearing, ""There ain't enough black centaurs in this movie! This is an outrage!"" Yes, it's true that African American have had a terrible time trying to make their way in this country, and have had horrific acts committed against them, but this is something that me and my ancestors had nothing to do with, yet I will forever pay a price for this because I happen to be a caucasian. Just like ""Songs Of The South"", one would have to read into it real hard to see this alleged racism, and it is a purely subjective interpretation. This is America and we shouldn not allow the ""thought police"" to tell us what we can or can't read or watch. If it offends someone, well, sorry but such is the price of freedom. Disney should release the popular 1969 edit which does not have this scene (I would be perfectly happy with it) and a more expensive ""Special Collector's Edition"" which has multiple versions, tons of extras, and if you don't like the Sunflower scene, then don't buy it and shut your blapper!!!

Mistake #4: Why hasn't anyone mentioned the harpie's tits? This movie has tits. Harpie tits with burning red nipples. Pefect for kids under 8.",1349654400,,2937,4.49625468164794

4240924,5,B0040QTNSU,"Ok, I will do a review on two of my all-time favorite Disney movies of all-time. They are Fantasia, and Fantasia 2000. I will be grading the pieces of music by the animation, and the pace of the music (The pace will not take away from the music however), and the music. Here we go! Let's start with the first Fantasia....

The people of the Philadelphia Orchestra start coming in and going to their instruments that they will be playing throughout the movie. They are starting to practice until a gentleman named Deems Taylor comes in, and he gives the introduction of the movie. Then he introduces the Toccata a Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach. Then introduces the conducter of the movie, Leopold Stokowski.

Bach: Toccata a Fugue in D Minor: 5/5- Animation score. The Animation is spectacular as well as the Sun at the end. 4.5/5- Pace. It started slow a little bit, but then picked up right away, then slowed down, then picked right up to finish it off. 4/5- Music. The Music was great, and it had you wanting more in this 2 hour, 5 minute program.

Deems Taylor now introduces the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky.

Tchaikovasky: Nutcracker Suite: 5/5- Animation. The Animation was like a painting that was turning into a light show. It had fairies, dancing mushrooms and flowers. 3.5/5- Pace. The Pace was weird here because it started slow, and stayed slow, until the Dancing Mushrooms came on, then it went back to slow pace, then when the Dancing Flowers were dancing, it picked up, then it stayed like that until it ended. 5/5- Music. The Music was spectacular because it had some very famous pieces here.

Next up is the most famous one, The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

Dukas: The Sorcerer's Apprentice: 5/5- Animation. It had Mickey Mouse in this so it scored big time. 5/5- Pace. It wins the Best Pace of the Movie Award. 5/5- Music. The Music was very fun to hear.

Then, Mickey Mouse says Hi to Leopold Stowkowski.

Next is the very slow-paced Rite of Spring.

Stravinsky: Rite Of Spring: 5/5- Animation. The Animation was brilliant with the Dinosaurs in this. 2/5- Pace. This is what I am talking about, the pace for this piece of music is heavily slow, and it pretty much stays like this during the whole segment, it starts very very slow, then picks up, but goes right back down again, and stays like this the whole segment. 3/5- Music. The Music is good, but it is slow as well.

Next is a 15 minute Intermission.

Now they come back and Deems Taylor introduces the Soundtrack. This is a great segment that gets a 5/5 because of the sounds you will hear.

Next is my favorite piece of Music in the Movie, Symphony #6 by Beethoven.

Beethoven: Symphony #6: 5/5- Animation. It wins the Best Animation of the Movie Award. You will see the Gods like Diana, Vulcan, Zeus, and Isis. The Centaurs and the Centaurettes are in this as well, along with Pegasus and his family, and Cupids. 5/5- Pace. It starts kinda slow, but it picks up and stays like that for the whole piece of music. 5/5- Music. The Music is well done in this well-paced piece of music. This is my favorite segment in this whole Movie.

Next up is The Dance of the Hours.

Ponchielli: Dance of the Hours: 5/5- Animation. It is very well done here as you will see the Hours of Day, and the Hours of Night battle it out. 5/5- Pace. The Pace is a very fast one here, but it will get a 5/5. 5/5- Music. This is a very famous piece of Music because it has been heard in Symphony Halls, and on TV shows as well.

Now we end this program off with a bang! Here is a combination of Night On Bald Mountain and the Ave Maria.

Mussorgsky: Night on Bald Mountain: 5/5- Animation. The Animation is quite spectacular, and funny. 5/5- Pace. It is very fast-paced because they were finishing up the Movie. 5/5- Music. The Music is very cool here.

Schubert: Ave Maria: It is the same Animation as Night on Bald Mountain. But it gets a 5/5 for the Music.

There you have it, the first Fantasia was a great one. The Movie and The Music earn a score of 5/5.

Now, it is time for Fantasia 2000......

We start off with Symphony #5 by Beethoven.

Beethoven: Symphony #5: It is so fast, I will not grade it for the Pace. However, the Animation gets a 5/5 because it is colorful and spectacular. The Music gets a 5/5 because you can hear it as the Intro Music for Judge Judy.

Next up is Respighi's Pines of Rome, my favorite one in this Movie.

Respighi: Pines of Rome: 5/5- Animation. It wins the Best Animation of the Movie Award for the Whales, Aurora Boriallis, and the Arctic. 5/5- Pace. It also wins the Best Pace of the Movie Award because it was not too slow or fast. 5/5- Music. It also wins the Best Piece of Music of the Movie Award because it was a great showing of gratitude as well.

Next is Rhapsody in Blue.

Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue: 5/5- Animation. It was great Animation, and yet funny at times. 5/5- Pace. It was a very cool pace, started slow, then picked up, then went into a pace that had one of the best, if not the best endings that Fantasia and Disney would want to see. 5/5- Music. The Music is beautiful here.

Next is Piano Concerto #2.

Shostakovich: Piano Concerto #2 Allegro Opus 102: 5/5- Animation. The Animation was awesome that had an evil Jack in the Box going after a Princess and a one-leged Tin Soldier. 5/5- Pace. The Pace was great as well. 5/5- Music. The Music was great to hear.

Next is a funny one called Carnival of the Animals.

Saint-Saens: Carnival of the Animals: I will give this a 5/5 rating because it was so funny because a Flamingo had a yo-yo.

Next is the very famous Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Disney's Chief Cartoon Character, Mickey Mouse.

Dukas: The Sorcerer's Apprentice: I already rated this on the previous Fantasia. If you want to see the rating, look at the rating for Fantasia.

Next is Pomp and Circumstance starring Donald Duck and Daisy Duck.

Elgar: Pomp and Circumstance: 5/5- Animation. It was very funny to see Donald Duck and Daisy Duck in this, but it was great too. 5/5- Pace. The Pace was great. 5/5- Music. The Music was nice to hear.

Now we are at the end of Fantasia 2000, so here is the Firebird Suite.

Stravinsky: Firebird Suite: 5/5- Animation. The Animation was so beautiful because it was very colorful and exciting to see. 5/5- Pace. The Pace is well done. 5/5- Music. The Music here was spectacular and exciting.

There you have it, Fantasia 2000 deserves a score of 5/5.

4240925,4,B0040QTNSU,"Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are two of the most interesting and rewatchable animated films ever made.

The image on these blu-rays is fabulous, and the audio is amazing.

Extras are slightly disappointing, since you must have BD-Live (which I lack) to access the older DVD features on both movies. This inclusion of the short film Destino definitely bumps up the extras score, though.",1345593600,2,383,5.063492063492063
4240926,5,B0040QTNSU,"The original Fantasia is in very good quality and is an awesome classic. It is amazing how they thoughtfully paired the music with art to encompass the tone of the music. I raised my niece and nephew watching this and they loved it. I purchased this for my son who is 17 months, and he loves pretending that he is a conductor to the music.

However, the second version (Fantasia 2000) is not as interesting or thoughtful. It seems as if they were more concerned with making ""beautiful"" drawings, and having nice graphics, rather than having a good conceptual idea of what visual pictures would compliment the music. I am not a fan of Fantasia 2000, but would still recommend purchasing the set because it is a great way to introduce classical music to your children.",1336176000,2,766,4.632352941176471

4240928,1,B0040QTNSU,"I was amazed to find that the color in the original Fantasia in both the Blu-Ray and the DVD is very much worse than it was in the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD, which was also ""digitally remastered"" and released a decade ago.  The digital remastering in this version has the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  Many of the beautiful and often subtle colors that were in the original have been replaced by brilliant, saturated, mostly primary colors so that the original effect is often entirely lost. If you are thinking this might be a case of restoring the brilliancy of faded original colors, there is no shortage of examples of what the original colors were, and Fantasia was shot in the original Technicolor, which produced silver-based masters rather than the dye-based masters known for fading.  The deterioration often goes beyond color.  All the beauty and subtlety of the milkweed seed dancers in Nutcracker is gone, and that scene uses very little color.  The 60th Anniversary Edition is still widely available.  Assuming that Disney is still using the original DVDs in the 60th sets being sold now, that is a much better bet if you want to see Fantasia at its original artistic best.",1330128000,21,1188,4.856435643564357

4240939,5,B0040QTNSU,"This 2000 update of the famed Walt Disney Fantasia has eight well-known personalities from the arts introduce eight of the more exciting and easily recognizable classical pieces of music with shrewd animation backgrounds. The film initiates young people into the enjoyment of classical music very effectively. Even older people will like both the music and the witty and often humorous animations that accompany the pieces.
The first selection is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. It is backed up by abstract figures of butterflies, birds, lightning, and other swirling objects dancing in time with the music. The second is Pines of Rome, which has swarms of likable whales, including a baby whale that gets lost, flying and swimming to the beat of the music. The third is Rhapsody in Blue, which is accompanied by drawings of New York life and cartoon dramas of characters such as a young girl, a dissatisfied construction worker who wants to be a musician, an out of work penniless man searching for work, and a husband whose  wife harasses him.  The fourth is Shostakovich's Piano Concerto Number 2, with a story of a one footed tin soldier who saves a toy ballerina from a jack in the box villain. Carnival of the Animals in number 5, which shows birds annoyed with one of their flock who constantly plays with yoyos, tossing them in all directions. Next, as number 6, is The Sorcerer's Apprentice, which appeared in the original Fantasia, with Mickey Mouse using magic to lighten his work, but not knowing how to stop what he started. Then, as number seven is Pomp and Circumstances with Donald Duck acting as Noah's helper at the time of the flood, depicting him and his wife Minnie distraught because they think that the other is lost in the flood.  The final piece is The Firebird playing to a background of a story about a fairy-like creature and her involvement in life, death, and, happily, rebirth.",1323302400,,1904,4.87037037037037
4240940,5,B0040QTNSU,"I speak of course about Sunflower.  She is a big lipped, buck toothed, nappy haired mule and extremely racist.  Why would you want to ruin a masterpiece with a bad decision that someone made in 1940.  This is my favorite Disney movie and I watch it with my daughter. At some point in her life We'll have to talk about how people judge other people over things that are superficial and how life was different 70 years ago. I'd prefer to have that lesson come up elsewhere. All the other DVD releases that people are referring to, like the Silly Symphonies collection are sets geared towards adult collectors.  With Fantasia we are talking about a general release for people of all ages.  Put yourself in the shoes of a black child who just wants to watch a innocent movie.  Is it worth the slap in the face so some middle age white nerd who lives with his mom can pontificate about the purity of the art of animation all for what amounts to 8 seconds of the movie? Get a grip people. I've seen this movie 20 time since I bought it and only now can I identify the pan and scan where they edited this out.  All of you who are talking about being able to see the footage on YouTube, well, go to youtube and watch it. Do you research, learn the lesson that's there to be learned. When you sit down to watch this masterpiece try focusing on the music and the visuals that are beautiful and stop wasting your time pining for some taboo.

As a result of seeing that movie, I became a lifetime fan of classical music, even though I also still love big band, dixieland and barbershop quartet music I really appreciate classical music.

Fantasia 2000 was good, but it lacked Walt Disney's hand and, like many sequels, was not as good as the original..",1320537600,,644,4.573913043478261

So I was familiar with both of them and, I must admit that I have always enjoyed Walt Disney's movies.  He was ahead of his time when ""Fantasia"" was released in whatever the year.

4240948,5,B0040QTNSU,"The package came just as it would at the store. If you are worried about buying online, you shouldn't with this product. It had all the inserts/ pockets/goodies. All disks worked just fine.",1310601600,,189,4.757575757575758
4240949,4,B0040QTNSU,"I'll skirt most of the controversy aspects on the subject of Fantasia as they're being extensively written about here. (Bottom line: I would prefer them to have made it possible to see the original version of the film in some sort of branching option, but it's understandable and sadly expected that it has not been included.) It's also too bad that the audio had to be redone in several sections, namely the live-action parts.
As it is, the inclusion of as much as possible of the Deems Taylor introductions helps this film immensely in my opinion. It fleshes the original film out and puts the pieces into a better context. It also doesn't hurt that ""Meet the Soundtrack"" is easily one of my favorite parts of the film, a light contrast piece to Rite of Spring or Night on Bald Mountain. So one can at least appreciate the work that went into recreating them as best they could ten years ago for the DVD set.
As an owner of the previous DVD set, I can say that in some ways, it's preferable to the new Blu-Ray. It's easier to get around in and, while the extras take a third disc, I prefer that all the extras are right there on the disc instead of ""in the cloud"" as is now so en vogue to say. However, there are a few extras on this disc that certainly make it worthy of being eyed for a double-dip. First and foremost is the completed short that Salvador Dali began working on at the Disney studios over 50 years ago, Destino. It looks tremendous. Looking at the finished product, it works, but it also looks like it might not have been a mistake for Walt to shelve the project in '46. Without decades to get used to Dali's imagery, it would seem even more strange and alien. Had it been produced then, it would have been even more of a museum piece. Let's just call it ahead of its time. There is also an accompanying feature-length documentary that easily could have cut a lot of its running time and still been informative. One piece that I actually would love to have expanded (or even included as a gallery of the book itself) is a documentary about the Schultheis Notebook: a diary of Fantasia's special effects production that contains amazing details about how the production was accomplished. It's not a stretch to say that Fantasia belongs to a very small list of the most technically advanced films ever made, like The Ten Commandments and Star Wars. Until this production diary was found (made by an employee who offered to sell it to the studio once production was complete and turned down... looks like the studio ended up getting the best of that bargain in the long run), many of the special effects were a mystery to those who came after the production, so radical and specific (and disposable) were they.
As for the films themselves, I never appreciated Fantasia as a child. It wasn't until I was an adult and was able to watch it purely as a piece of art that I wasn't bored to tears. Looking from an adult perspective, Fantasia has some spots that go on too long, some that are masterpieces and some that are still tough for me to get through. (Sorry, but that Nutcracker portion does me in every time.) But I can appreciate all of it from an artists perspective. The Rite of Spring may be scientifically inaccurate, but it's still spectacular. And it took some balls to produce in the late 30s. The Freddy Moore girls design for the centaurs (waist up, of course) is beautiful. Night on Bald Mountain is ultimately fantastic and scary however you look at it. Fantasia 2000 never dawdles, but in that way it has the opposite problems of its predecessor. With the exception of Rhapsody in Blue, most of the pieces feel too rushed, especially the Carnival of the Animals. It's more brilliantly funny than anything in the original film, but is so short that it feels empty. At a scant 74 minutes, you get the feeling they were afraid of stretching their legs, lest they overstay their welcome.
As for the technical aspects of the blu ray, the film has never looked (and most likely never will look) better. One of my rules for blu rays is that I will always double-dip on a Disney release because the HD visual presentation is spectacular and thus far I've yet to have a transfer let me down. While I don't have a surround sound system (my apartment is much too small), it sounded excellent to my ears.",1310169600,6,4323,4.50828025477707

4240951,5,B0040QTNSU,"I first saw Fantasia in a neighborhood theater shortly after its first release.  I then went to one of the ""special"" downtown (high priced) ones to enjoy it with a better sound system.  I bought the vinyl ""HI-Fi"" disc when it was available and have enjoyed it countless times.  When it be came available on VHS I bought it and was rewarded with the visuals again.  It became one of our top 5 replayed favorites.  I missed buying it on DVD and am oh so happy I did.  Viewing and hearing it on HD TV (Blu-Ray) and hearing it through my excellent surround sound system is better than ever before.

He ended up just taking us out of the theater because we were obviously restless. I had thought that as an adult I would appreciate the combination of the beautiful artwork and the classical music. I was wrong. I turned this on, and while I do think it is beautiful and the music is fantastic I was asleep within minutes.  I gave this four stars because (again) the music is very good and the art is very nice, but also, I slept so well with it playing in the background I am very glad that I bought it. Sometimes we need a good long nap and that is what I got from this.  Whenever I am feeling stressed and cant get to sleep, I just pop this into the player and I am off to the most restful and relaxing deep sleep. As far as the racist centaur, she is not in this movie. She wasn't in the movie when I was a child either so I guess Disney handled that eons ago.  I couldn't resit going on youtube to see the so called racism and I must say... WOW.  That was a mess.

No worries, they loved it, and were actually riveted most of the time. For those that haven't read other reviews on this Edition, it includes 2 DVDs - one of the original Fantasia (minus a 15 second edit that you can read more about in the first review here at Amazon) and one of 'Fantasia 2000', a shortened version, with only some of the sequences, and others edited down. We first watched the Fantasia 2000, since it is only 90 minutes, and the kids liked it so much we ended up watching the full edition the next day. I will say that the full edition has some scary sequences for young kids - demon type visions, etc., but compared to a lot of modern animated films, is still quite tame. I love that this is mostly classical music as well, so that they are getting more exposure to that. And for adults, I think this is simply stunning, some of the sequences are quite sophisticated in their use of the animation in relation to the music.",1306886400,,1111,4.320574162679426

4240958,4,B0040QTNSU,"Everyone loves the original ""Fastasia"".  There's nothing I can add to help sell this 1940's classic.  You either love it, or you just don't get it.  For a Disney film, I really don't think too many kids would get into it.  It took a few viewings for me to eventually begin to embrace it.

However, ""Fantasia 2000"" doesn't seem to be as wonderful as I expected.  It's an extremely short film compared to the original but still worthy of purchase since you'll buy both together in this one complete Blu-Ray set.  I find it hard to believe that this was all that they could come up with after 60 years from the original ""Fantasia.""  On ""Fantasia 2000"", Bette Midler says that they screened so many different artists work that was intended to be a part of ""Fantasia 2000"" but many just didn't make the cut. I find that hard to believe because this movie was so short, and yet it still included a re-play of the original ""Sorcerer's Apprentice."" If you take that out of this film, then ""Fantasia 2000"" would only be about one hour long.

It was smart that they put these two movies together as one package because I really don't think very many people would have bought ""Fantasia 2000"" on it's own.  I wouldn't have.

One other disappointment I have with this release is that they release these movies with both the Blu-Ray and the DVD, making this a totally unnecessary 4 disc release.  Who needs the DVD's?  If you already have a Blu-Ray player, then you don't need the DVD's, right?

One other disappointment too with Disney releases (and many other movies on disc) is that you have to watch a ton of previews before you get to watch the movie.  Luckily, you can just continue to click ""skip"" but I wish I didn't have to.  I'd rather watch other previews as an option to click on later, or to have them play after the movie.

There is technology available now to improve the sound--to sound more like an actual live orchestra.  I wish that had been done here.  Otherwise, the color was better.  Fantasia 2000 was too short and, with a repeat of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", it was even shorter still.  Nonetheless, both DVDs were still great to listen to.

4240968,3,B0040QTNSU,"After reading every one of the younger viewers reviews they seem to think everybody in the world is under the age of 35. I hate to tell you this but, but ""Yoo-hoo"" there are some of us who actually remember when Disneyland and Disney World opened! I was actually there the day Disney World opened in Florida.

Fantasia was totally Walt's concept to take classical music and put it to animation so that youngsters (and older people, too) would enjoy it and therefore preserve classical music for all time. Walt saw jazz as a destruction of what he believed of as ""real music"" and believed kids needed to remember the classics. He wasn't so stupid that he believed he could make new forms of music go away but through Mickey Mouse and the magic of his animation geniuses he could preserve classical music.

If he was alive when Roy Disney made Fantasia 2000 he would have B-slapped him for using jazz music to continue that legacy.

I don't deny that Rhapsody in Blue was a great work in Fantasia 2000 but it violated what Walt's original concept was for Fantasia. Just watch the interviews with Walt and you can hear it for yourself: ""Classical music"".

Fantasia 2000 was panned by the critics, was a box office disaster and remains in the bargain bins at Wal-Mart for $5 when you can find it at all in normal DVD release. It's no wonder that in order to attract anyone to buy this that they had to make it into a special set along with the original Fantasia to get people to buy it.

One more thing; Walt hated impressionistic painting and the concept of pairing Salvador Dali in Fantasia 2000 would have probably made Walt throw up all over his desk in wonderful Technicolor!

4240970,2,B0040QTNSU,"Since there's so much discussion here of the ""censored"" scenes (actually teensy insignificant clips that some people rightly find offensive now), I'm going to lodge my own complaint about censorship of this classic -- and I mean the elimination of Deems Taylor's original narration, replacing it with the utterly boring, zero-personality, insultingly artificial tones of ""voice actor"" Corey Burton. Allegedly, the voice tracks for some of Taylor's scenes had been ""lost,"" so everything had to go. If that's true -- at Disney, of all places, which hasn't thrown anything away since Walt left Kansas City -- then I hope some incompetent nitwit lost his or her job and was blackballed for life. And even if it is, in this day and age of digital marvels, I can't believe there was no way to simulate Taylor's voice, or at least to hire someone (Rich Little?) who could impersonate it. They were simply to cheap and lazy to bother. (It would be like replacing Laurence Olivier's entire voice track in SPARTACUS with, oh, Brian Williams just so they could include that ""oysters"" scene with Tony Curtis.)

I don't begrudge anyone who wanted the ""Sunflower"" scenes cut. But cutting Deems Taylor? For shame. I will never spend another cent on any FANTASIA video until this travesty is corrected.",1304812800,,1286,4.981395348837209

The time flies by as the classical music is visualized by the Disney animaters in ways that may not be what the original composer might have been thinking but in a way that is completely entertaining.

For a film of this age, the bluray transfer is clean and shows no more grain than is needed to capture the original theatrical experience.  This is one of the few films that I have seen that makes my 62 inch screen seem small.  Theatrically, Fantasia has always been released to very large theater screens and it shows in the amount of detail in the image.

I am sick and tired of Disney's teasing the customer by vaulting to force a rush on purchase.  Now, I read that they add defects in the Fantasia disks
to make it less desirable to copy these disks.  Of course there is copy protect defeat software out there, but, let's face it, if the original product
is defective, why buy it at all?

I think it's a rotten trick to make us hold our breath so that we can rush out to buy it when it is released again.
Well, I'm too old to wait or permit myself to be made anxious over this stuff, so I not only avoid buying Disney media releases, I also don't bother to attend the
Disney movies.

4240993,4,B0040QTNSU,"Fantasia was one of the movies I absolutely adored growing up as a child. I can't remember how many VHS tapes I wore out over the years, and it used to be a joke that every birthday or Christmas, I'd have to receive a new copy of Fantasia to replace a worn-out one. I still have my latest one and am happy to say that it is holding up well. I have every nuance of sound a video of Fantasia memorized so well that if my thoughts could hypothetically be projected on a screen and a set of speakers, you'd get an exact copy of the VHS version of Fantasia (that's a truly fantastical statement, I know, but understand that I loved everything about this movie). However, I'm updating my DVD library to Blu-ray. That said, I REFUSED to buy the DVD version of Fantasia as I was infuriated by the fact that they had overdubbed Deems Taylor's voice with some mousey-sounding voice actor. His voice is incredibly annoying, and as someone who has done amateur voice-over work myself, I really can't stand his tonal quality. For those of you who don't know, Joseph Deems Taylor was a very well respected composer and music critic. He had a very lovely, sonorous voice that was always very pleasing to hear narrating in between the musical numbers. I've memorized his script from the VHS, and so every time the orchestra finishes warming up at the beginning, I always expect to hear that voice saying speaking to us, the audience.

Today, I bit the bullet and purchased the Blu-ray edition. As I figured would happen, the annoying voice over dub was carried over into this version. I feel like it's such a slap in the face of Deems Taylor to have this guy reading his lines. Yes, I know, the reason why they did it was because the original audio tracks for the added scenes were destroyed...but why did they overdub the ENTIRE movie?! Why not just have the guy overdub the added scenes and keep Taylor's voice in the scenes they do have the audio track for? Even if they didn't have the ORIGINAL audio track, there are still plenty of Fantasia copies lying around that have the needed audio. I have witnessed enough of the incredible work of audio engineers to know that it was more than possible for them to extract the audio from say the VHS version and remaster is to Blu-ray quality.

As for the added scenes, I would have been happier to have had them as bonus features or alternate angles. For someone who has beaten the dead horse about his love for the VHS version, I wouldn't have minded seeing the version that I'm familiar with remastered and otherwise left alone.

Now here's what I DO like about the Blu-Ray edition. The video quality is - for the most part - superb! The for the most part is some minor issues that comes with ""color bleeding"" in the remastering process. For one thing, Deems Taylor's face is weirdly distorted to an orange color. Indeed, the first time I saw it on this version, I thought he had a bad case of jaundice. In contrast, the animated scenes have never looked better! The colors are rich and utterly stunning. I am reminded of the Blu-ray edition of Beauty and the Beast. Once again, Disney has stunned me into near reverence with their incredible use of color and texture. I'm sorry to speak ill of my beloved VHS copy, but there were some animated parts that I had no idea existed within some of the scenes that I was otherwise very familiar with. By brightening the colors and truly some masterful handiwork by some truly talented artists, what was invisible could now be seen.

The music is absolutely stunning in this version. Since my fingers are starting to tire from this review, I'll let blu-ray.com speak for this section:

There's no two ways about it: Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 sound magnificent. Boasting two impeccably mastered, utterly absorbing DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround tracks, each film surpasses expectation, drawing the listener into every whirlwind dervish and swirling symphony the pair have to offer. Strings rustle beneath a storm of horns, trumpets pierce lumbering bass lines, timpani tum-tum-tums hang heavily over fleeting frenzies of flutes, and tumbling harps stir gracefully within the majesty of it all. Gripping melodies roar and relent, the orchestra fills the front channels convincingly, and sound spreads around the room with natural ease. Throughout each animated segment, LFE presence is profound and powerful, rear speaker activity enhances the illusion of sitting in the middle of a concert hall, and dynamics are bold, brazen and breathtaking. It's enough to leave the hair on your neck and arms bristling in the sonic breeze. Meanwhile, the various introductions feature crystal clear voices, and the interaction between the narrators and the conductors never falter. Likewise, directionality is subtle but precise, pans are wholly transparent, and the whole of both experiences is perfectly engaging. Audiophiles of all ages will be thrilled with the results.

-end blu-ray.com section-

For those of you whining over the fact that they STILL left out the apparently racist centaurette, I say get the heck over it. As many people have said, it amounts to a few seconds, and really no one except some sticklers who feel slighted by the smallest amount of censorship cares. More importantly, Disney doesn't care that a handful of people want to see the centaurette. Even if it WAS brought back, however, it would in no way hinder or impede on the beauty that is Fantasia. That said, Fantasia is absolutely perfect without her. Also, some people have said the other centaurs are sexually provocative and wouldn't want to show their young children those scenes...Really? Trust me, young children aren't thinking about ANYTHING along the lines of sexuality in those scenes. I am a living testimony in that regards. Stop sheltering kids from something that is absolutely beautiful!

I haven't gotten to watch Fantasia 2000 or the bonus features yet, but I will submit a comment on this review as soon as I get to that. However, it may take some time as I am busy being a college student.

All in all, I'm tentatively wary of this, because I'm very reactionary when it comes to something I grew up adoring like Fantasia. I'm trying to decide if the enriched animation and music outweighs the overdubbed narration and unnecessarily added scenes. I will, of course, be keeping my VHS for both nostalgic and sentimental purposes. Thank you to all of you who have read this far.",1297987200,4,6448,4.78096947935368

4241011,4,B0040QTNSU,"To start, I can't say I know anything about the censorship in Fantasia and personally I grew up never noticing any revisions made: I think the film is just fine as it is.

The most important thing to know about Fantasia is that it isn't a conventional Disney animated film: it is (like the title says) music an animation paired together.  If you like such things, it can be a wonderful experience.  If you're like some of my family, you may be turned off by the fact that there is ""no plot"".  As they say within the movie, some of the sequences tell a definite story (The Magician's Apprentice, Pomp and Circumstance).  Other's are less coherent, but are still obvious as to what is being portrayed, and then there are a few completely abstract pieces.  There's no princesses in distress here.

The second most important thing to know about Fantasia is that one of the movies is very old.  The original Fantasia has no widescreen support, although they do supply an alternative through Disney Vision, which fills the extra screen space with different paintings throughout the movie)  The age of the movie also means that the sound quality... the music recording is less than ideal.  I'm told that the music was re-recorded with earlier releases, and it would have been nice for Disney to include it as an alternate audio track, but it is missing, perhaps in an attempt to maintain authenticity.  The quality of the 1940 recording will be immediately noticeable, but eventually, like the age of the animation, you become used to it (or I did anyway).  It is the quality of the recording in the original Fantasia that made me rate the set only 4 stars.

The animation for both films is top-notch, and even the original fantasia still looks good today.

Because of the age of the original Fantasia, and all the less than ideal sound quality, Fantasia 2000 is probably the better release in this bundle, which is a little sad seeing as the Original Fantasia featured 8 pieces of music to Fantasia 2000 's 6 (and one of those was brought back from the original Fantasia)

Still, both films combined make for a powerful experience that is ultimately easy to enjoy, despite the age of it's source material and whatever censorhip occurred (I understand it was about 10 seconds of altered material).",1296432000,6,2290,4.71859296482412
4241012,4,B0040QTNSU,"The original Fantasia was released in 1940 with the intent being to ""show what music looked like and what pictures sounded like"". Beautiful classical music was interpreted by the Disney animators and they developed the ground-breaking techniques you see in the film.  Walt Disney had planned for new versions to be produced at intervals. Somehow I missed seeing the original if it was shown on television and this was the first time I had seen these award-winning animated films. You need to remember that what you are seeimg is not the technology of computer-generated animation that we are used to seeing in the 21st century. In the l940s every cell was drawn and colored by hand with many artists working on the various characters and objects being animated. It's nothing short of genius. The restoration and digital remastering are excellent on the DVD version and other reviewers have already raved about Blu-Ray. I found it very helpful to view the discussion of the making of Fantasia to understand Walt Disney and his collaborators' vision and intent with the various parts.  Fantasia 2000 is a completely new Fantasia with different classical music and different characters (objects) but true to the original intent of the Fantasia series. Roy Disney, Walt Disney's brother, was the Executive Producer of the Fantasia 2000 movie and these DVD versions are dedicated to his memory. Some famous performers help introduce the parts. Both of these Fantasia movies would be mesmerizing for children and be a wonderful introduction to beautiful classical music. The genius of Walt Disney, his attention to detail and his commitment to excellence has continued from the 1930s and his humble beginnings with Mickey Mouse to the Disney empire of today. The live theater performance of The Lion King changed the way musicals are presented on the stage and present the same giant leap-forward that the original Fantasia had on animation and film in 1940. Walt Disney was a national treasure--long-live the Disney magic!",1296259200,6,2017,5.127659574468085

Fantasia 2 Movie Collection Blu-ray delivers stunning video and reference-quality audio in this exceptional Blu-ray release

Fantasia: this ambitious animated epic from Disney studios includes sequences set to music by - amongst others - Bach, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Mussorgsky, Schubert and Beethoven. Also featured is the famous 'Sorcerer's Apprentice' routine, in which Mickey Mouse (voiced by Walt himself for the last time) creates magical mayhem when he tries to get his chores done with the aid of a spell or two.

Fantasia 2000: A semi-sequel to Disney's 1940 classic 'Fantasia' which features the original film's most famous sequence - the Mickey Mouse adventure 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' - plus seven other all-new animated interpretations of classical music. Highlights include the interwoven stories of a group of 1930s New Yorkers accompanied by Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue', the volcanic eruptions which illustrate Stravinsky's 'Firebird Suite', and the story of Noah, his ark, and his assistant Donald Duck, played out to the strains of Elgar's 'Pomp and Circumstance'.

This Blu-ray release includes the following titles, see individual titles for specs and details:

Reviewed by Kenneth Brown, November 27, 2010

It's easy to forget how bold a visionary the late Walt Disney truly was. Lest we forget, Snow White wasn't always the undisputed classic 21st century filmfans have declared it to be, nor was it a surefire business venture by any means. Released in 1937, when the country was still struggling to recover from the Great Depression, the fearless filmmaker's feature-length animation debut was deemed a risk, a fool's errand and a career killer. But hindsight can spot a money-maker a mile away. Snow White not only shattered expectations and revolutionized the film industry, it paved the way for countless artists, animators and dreamers, and gave birth to one of the most profitable forms of family entertainment in the modern age. 1940 would see the release of the next two Disney classics: Pinocchio, which went on to earn the same affection and accolades as Snow White, and Fantasia, easily Uncle Walt's most daring and experimental animated production. Conceived as a perpetually evolving experience -- one he originally intended to add additional segments to each year -- Fantasia wasn't nearly as successful as its forebearers, critically or commercially, but slowly assembled a discerning audience over the coming decades; viewers who finally responded to the allure of its concept, structure and vignettes. It soon became a Disney Classic alongside its more traditional brethren and even inspired a sequel much like the one Walt Disney often envisioned: 1999's Fantasia 2000. While thematically lighter than its somewhat moody predecessor, Fantasia 2000 complements Fantasia nicely, and both films, despite their divisive nature, achieve a great many things.

If an oboe isn't crooning in your head by now, you probably haven't seen 'Fantasia's most iconic segment...

How do you do. My name is Deems Taylor, and it's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here on behalf of Walt Disney, Leopold Stokowski and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, Fantasia. What you're going to see are the designs and pictures and stories that music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists. In other words, these are not going to be the interpretations of trained musicians. Which I think is all of the good. Now there are three kinds of music on this Fantasia program. First is the kind that tells a definite story. Then there's the kind that, while it has no specific plot, does paint a series of, more or less, definite pictures. Then there's a third kind: music that exists simply for its own sake.

Fantasia opens with a flurry of color and sound, and never panders to its audience for a second (well, minus Mickey's silhouetted chat with conductor Leopold Stokowski). Though pretension lingers nearby in the wings, it never strides on stage, giving the film's animators the freedom to indulge in whatever fits of whimsy, imagination and inspiration happens to guide their hands. Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor challenges viewers from the outset, surging and relenting at will, crackling with abstract bursts of energy and light, and announcing Fantasia's every lofty intention. From there, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite takes itself less seriously, tracking the passing of the seasons through a dance of ice-skimming fairies and flowering plants, and never once grounds itself in the doldrums of reality. Next up is Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice, the film's most accessible, family friendly and, above all else, memorable vignette. In it, Mickey plays a fledgling wizard who takes advantage of his master's absence. The resulting chaos leaves the befuddled mouse scrambling to stop an army of brooms from destroying his master's workshop, and continues to leave entire generations of children grinning from ear to ear. Soon, the first half of the film comes to a close with Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, a foray into evolution, the rise of the dinosaurs and a very bleak portrayal of the survival of the fittest. Relatively violent and potentially unsettling, it represents a unique marriage of music and animation, and hints at the darkness that lies in wait just before the credits roll.

After an unnecessary intermission and a cute ""Meet the Soundtrack"" segment, Fantasia plows ahead with Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony, more commonly known as The Pastoral Symphony. The weakest and most problematic of the original film's segments, the animators delve into Greek mythology, but neglect to establish an engrossing narrative or a compelling abstract world. Instead, it drags on and on as centaurs mate, cherub-like cupids hover at their heads, and a drunken bit of slapstick comedy undoes whatever carefully laid plans Disney had in mind. It isn't bad, mind you, and will delight many I'm sure. But it's slow, uneven and, frankly, bizarre. Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours rights Fantasia's course, even though its high-flying flourishes and balletic wildlife will appeal to young viewers far more than their parents. Dancers of the morning, afternoon, evening and night -- ostriches, hippos, elephants and alligators, respectively -- descend on an outdoor palace to celebrate the passage of another day, all to an amusing end. Finally, Modest Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria drag Fantasia to hell and back with one of the most unsettling, nightmarish bits of Disney animation committed to film. It opens as a massive demon called Chernabog raises the dead; a twisted cadre of scorned souls, skeletons and beasties of the netherworld, all intent on wreaking havoc on a sleepy little town. At least until a group of monks, accompanied by Schubert's soothing chorus, vanguish the evil and send it scurrying back to the grave. The film closes on a somber note, but considering Disney's hope that Fantasia would be expanded in the coming years after its initial release, the sobering, somewhat abrupt denouement isn't exactly a point of contention.

Fantasia is widely considered to be slightly superior to Fantasia 2000 for a number of reasons, but I actually enjoy the sequel considerably more than the original. Chalk it up to having a six-year-old in the house, stronger stories across the board, or its shorter, more manageable segments. Whatever the case, my family has only watched Fantasia a handful of times over the last few years, while this year alone, we've tossed in Fantasia 2000 on a dozen different occasions. (My only major gripe? The celebrity-helmed intros are obnoxious and decidedly forced.) Take that as you will though; to each his own and all that. The sequel begins much like the original, with an abstract explosion of color set to a powerful piece of music; in this case, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor. Presented as a battle between light and dark forces (interpreted as angular butterfly wings), it's a fittingly engrossing opening to a creatively buoyant film, and a visual stunner that plays with shape, perspective and form. Ottorino Respighi's Pines of Rome follows suit as flying whales migrate into the heavens. Dazzling and distinct, it's brimming with cold underwater vistas, sweeping flights of fancy and beautiful imagery. Does it make sense? Not a lick. Does it matter? Not at all. Next comes George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, a glimpse into the troubled lives of four people in 1930s New York. Drawing inspiration from Al Hirschfeld's cartooning style and taking full advantage of the big brass brevity of Gershwin's piece, it's a brisk, cheerful, resonant vignette that keeps Fantasia 2000 hurtling down a diverse, increasingly exciting animated highway.

Thankfully, Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major doesn't let up, painting the story of a disfigured toy soldier who's determined to rescue the love of his plastic life, a tiny ballerina, from the clutches of an evil jack-in-the-box. Sweet and surprisingly poignant, it offers a touching, fully realized tale in a few short minutes, and speaks volumes even though its pint-sized protagonists never say a word. Soon thereafter, Camille Saint-Sans's The Carnival of the Animals provides the sequel with one of its lesser entries, a fun but mildly shallow short in which a yo-yo obsessed flamingo tries to maintain his individuality when his flock tries to get him to fall in line. It's thematic ground Disney has trod hundreds of times before, and the segment does little to break the mold. Endearing? Briefly. Forgettable? Wholly. Unfortunately, the appearance of the original Fantasia's Sorcerer's Apprentice segment doesn't help Fantasia 2000 shed its sudden sense of familiarity. While the vignette itself is as nostalgic as ever, a newly animated version of the classic short would have been a godsend. Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance brings things back around, casting Donald and Daisy Duck as workers on Noah's ark. Although other classical music selections would have been better suited to the story at hand, the personality on display and the animation itself represents another strong showing from the sequel. Last but certainly not least is Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite, by far my favorite vignette from either film. Cut from a Miyazaki-tinted cloth, it finds a nature sprite and a noble elk scrambling to survive the fiery wrath of an erupting volcano. Mesmerizing, evocative, gorgeous and paired with a pitch-perfect Russian ballet, it rises above all other things Fantasia and, in my humble opinion, stands apart as one of Disney's most impressive animated shorts (and yes, that includes Pixar's best).

Ultimately, both Fantasias have their share of issues. However, Walt Disney's pioneering spirit permeates each one and, critics of either film be damned, the studio's commitment to animated excellence prevails. As a Double Feature, most filmfans will prefer one over the other, but both can be appreciated in their own right; both can be seen as arresting forays into unconventional animation; and both will hopefully open the door for another Fantasia, bolstered by new visionaries and new dreamers dedicated to embracing everything the late Walt Disney held dear.

Aesthetically, Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 couldn't be more different. However, Disney has invested considerable effort into restoring, remastering and presenting each one as faithfully and proficiently as possible, and the 1080p/AVC-encoded results are equally beautiful. Color erupts from the screen at every turn, regardless of how blazing or bleak a particular segment's palette may be. Primaries are gorgeous, black levels are rich and inky, and contrast is strong and satisfying throughout. Each hand-painted backgrounds and CG dreamscape stands as a testament to its animators' skills, and textures -- whether born from an artist's brush or a turn-of-the-century computer -- are perfectly preserved and precisely resolved. Moreover, Fantasia's hand-drawn frames are as true to their source as Fantasia 2000's razor-wire line art and computer-generated characters. Yes, the latter is noticeably sharper than the former, but anyone who tries to pit the 1940 classic against its 1999 sequel is a poor, misguided apprentice in need of a master. Both transfers are largely free of artifacting, noise and other distracting anomalies, and only a few, brief oddities spoil the otherwise flawless presentations. Specifically? Inherent ringing and color bleeding haunt Fantasia's live-action scenes, and some extremely minor banding (watch the green sky during The Carnival of Animals), blocking (keep an eye on the murky depths of the ocean during Pines of Rome) and aliasing (typically associated with the film's CG elements) invade Fantasia 2000 on occasion. Again though, each instance is so negligible that even the most unflinching videophile will overlook whatever issue arises. Both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 look fantastic, and Disney has done a wonderful job of ushering each one into the 21st century. Animation enthusiasts and Vault collectors will be exceedingly happy with the treatment each one has received.

Anyone who does not have this for the blu-ray experience alone is missing a magical experience. I don't know how they restored this timeless classic to such digital perfection, but I am very pleased.

A word to the censorship bandwagon: Editing is NOT censorship. Artists have the right, privilege and responsibility to edit their works whenever possible for whatever reason they want. I have seen an increasingly positive, inclusive, uplifting evolution of the products that come from the Disney company and applaud their actions.

4241031,5,B0040QTNSU,"I was very pleased that the Disney Company has decided to re-issue this wonderful masterpiece that is Fantasia. And I speak especially about the 1940 version. I'm less enthusiastic of Fantasia 2000. But it's only my opinion.

Already I have bought several years away the 60th anniversary dvd of this work. So I could compare with the bluray edition of now. It's without comparison relative to the quality of the pictures, above all if we speak about a film 70 years old.
It's enough to see the Sorcerer's apprentice feature and to look at Mickey Mouse : I believed the movie had been made quite recently !

For foreign buyers like me it's interesting to see the original narrator we don't have on the French edition where he doesn't appear and is replaced by the voice of a deceased French actor well known in our country.

About languages and zones, I'm impressed by the effort of the Walt Disney Company to put all the movies and extras (very interesting in this new edition with particularly Destino and the San Francisco Disney museum of Diane Ann Miller)in several languages in audio or subtitles.

Last but not least, this four discs combo bluray-dvd cost half on Amazon.com including shipping of what it costs in France, where Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are sold separately and without combo edition. So it's a good bargain for such a masterpiece.
I highly recommend buying of this Disney box.",1295654400,2,1400,4.7727272727272725
4241032,5,B0040QTNSU,"I will keep this brief. If you have done any research on amazon, then you have seen the various 1 or 2 star reviews regarding the edits made in this film. If you are that interested, go to youtube and check them out for yourself. These scenes are incredibly racial and unnecessary and are an utter distraction to the beautiful film that is Fantasia. Now, if you feel that you need Fantasia to contain 15(?) seconds of racial content, then don't buy this Blu-Ray and institutionalize yourself immediately. Otherwise, if you have fond memories of this film from childhood, as I have, then buy this Blu-Ray set. What's more, it comes with Fantasia 2000, and DVD versions of both films. I watched Fantasia 2000 for the first time when I bought this set, and I was fairly disappointed. However, Fantasia alone justified this purchase. If you did enjoy the 2003 sequel, then you have all the more reason to buy this set. This is the definitive version, with incredible quality sound and picture, and the Blu-Ray menus and whatnot are fun and are somewhat interactive. So, if you have loved Fantasia all your life or you are introducing another Disney classic to your children, then look no further than Fantasia on Blu-Ray.

4241033,5,B0040QTNSU,"Doing a follow-up to an iconic film like the original ""Fantasia"" is no easy job, but Disney did it, and did it well.  ""Fantasia"" itself has been a favorite of mine since what must have been its first or second re-release, though I'm told that when I was very young the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" scared me (not any more: now I just love that mountain devil--I think his wings are gorgeous!).  Granted, I'm not as great a fan of Mickey Mouse as ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" as many people are, and I usually fast-forward through ""The Dance of the Hours,"" but the adaptation of the ""Nutcracker"" is quite good, Beethoven's ""Pastoral"" is an absolute delight (the centaurs and pegasi are favorites of mine, and the dance of the grape-stompers doesn't last anywhere near long enough!), and the ""Rite of Spring,"" featuring as it does that love of every kid's life, dinosaurs, should continue to find an audience for as long as humanity lasts!

In the new version, as in the first, there are eight musical features, and each one is a winner.  Beethoven's ""Symphony #5,"" like the earlier version's ""Toccata & Fugue,"" converts the music to abstract shapes, adding butterfly-like creatures fleeing, and finally overcoming, sinisters that remind me of Barbara Hambly's description of her ""Dark.""  Respighi's ""The Pines of Rome"" becomes a look at a family of CGI-enhanced right whales that levitate into the air, and features a stunning vision of the chambers inside an iceberg.  Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" is quite fittingly rendered in drawings based on the style of Burt Hirschfeld, following a group of Depression-Era New Yorkers--a black construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer, a lonely and overscheduled little girl who just wants to be with her busy parents, a henpecked husband, a jobless man--through a typical day.  The finale of Saint-Saens's ""Carnival of the Animals"" focuses on a misfit flamingo whose yo-yo play irritates his flock.  Marches 1-4 of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" feature Donald Duck as Noah's assistant on the Ark.  There are *two* pieces by Shostakovich: the ""Piano Concerto #2,"" which provides the background for a retelling of Hans Andersen's ""Steadfast Tin Soldier,"" and the ""Firebird Suite,"" apparently based on the eruption of Mount St. Helens, in which we meet a bull elk and his friend, the Spirit of Vegetation, and see how they survive and react to the cataclysm.  There's also a repeat of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" for reasons not really clear.  Celebrities including Bette Midler, Steve Martin, Itzhak Perlman, Penn & Teller, and Angela Lansbury provide commentary to the selections.  The set includes a featurette focusing on the abandoned project that was to be titled ""Musicana.""  As both an introduction to classical music and a visual delight on its own, this set should be in every family's video library.",1295568000,,2853,5.04468085106383

Fantasia 2000 looks wonderful too, and that soundtrack sounds even better than Fantasia's.

I was regretting my purchase, even though I got the disc for $10. I put it on my 2-Sell shelf without even watching Fantasia 2000.

A few nights later, my 7-yr old son couldn't sleep one night, so I decided to put on Fantasia 2000 figuring it would put him right to sleep. Imagine my surprise, when both him and I were wide-eyed an hour and a quarter later after enjoying the whole movie. Fantasia 2000 addressed all the issues I had with the original - it was shorter, the stories were more interesting, and it was less ""artsy"". In general, the movie didn't take itself too seriously. Fantasia seemed to be saying, ""Look at me! I'm a brilliant piece of art! You must appreciate me!"". In contrast, Fantasia 2000 was saying, ""Sit back and enjoy the show!""

After viewing it, my son asked if we could watch it again right away, and I told him not right now, but any other night you want kid. (Looks like I'll be keeping this blu-ray for awhile...)",1295222400,3,1107,4.368932038834951

With this new DVD release, the animation looks very beautiful and the colors are even more brighter and brilliant then ever. The only things that were a little disappointing was the voice dubbing over Deems Taylor's and showing one single female centurette twice. I think the Disney company could have done a little better by adding the missing character ""sunflower"" as a hidden bonus feature on the DVD/Blu-Ray discs where young children don't have to see it, only the adults.

So imagine my surprise watching the DVD. The changes are slight, but noticeable. In the VHS, the narration for most of the pieces are cut short. Yes, the DVD restores them to their full lengths, but I think it detracts from the movie. Now, every piece is spelled out, as if making a checklist of scenes to watch. Also, there is a very weird, choppy edit during the Pastoral sequence, when the female centaurs are coming out to greet the male centaurs. From 01:21:10 to 01:21:23, the green female centaur is shown twice coming down the steps; in the VHS, this is not so. I don't know how Disney managed to make the DVD edits more choppy than the VHS, but it did.

The edit in the Pastoral sequence that somewhat redeemed the DVD version was showing the red carpet unrolling for Bacchus, and showing Bacchus sitting/toppling on his ""throne."" In the VHS, this scene is simply cropped to edit out Sunflower; in the DVD, the scenes are shown in full - not cropped. That's some pretty awesome Photoshopping!",1294185600,,1153,4.570048309178744

it came to the demon or ""devil"" she got scared and ran out of the room, that's when I turned it off.
I gave it to family friends that love it and are more age appropriate, in their late 20's. It is a collectable edition and
they are Disney buffs and into the classical music scene. Other then that, I enjoyed the graphics from that time era and the
inovation of the musical material.
I recommend this to an older audience of children that can tell the difference between right and wrong, good and evil and the
interpretation of ideas with music. We did something similar in my first year college Art & Design class with music and it is
a good tool to learn something new using musical scores. It's a Disney worth watching again.",1293840000,,977,4.315217391304348

4241083,5,B0040QTNSU,"Fantasia is one of the all-time classic movies, and Disney tends to hold on to this one for years without re-release.  In fact, except for Snow White, this one has not been seen for purchase for about 20 years.  So, when you have the chance to purchase it, you must take it!  The idea behind the original movie was to set stories to music (to put it simply), and Disney chose some iconic pieces and set his artists to work.  However, he did not stop at putting his finest cartoonists on the project.  He also got one of the top (if not the top) conductors at the time, Leopold Stokowsky, to manage the score.  (For those who think that name is familiar, check out Warner Bros.' cartoon, ""Long Haired Hair."") The result was a magical rendition, and it was one of Disney's favorites.  However, it was not well-received publicly, though the critics liked it.  As a result, it stayed hidden for years, only coming out once a decade or so.  (In fact, it didn't even come out in the 1990s.)  In the 1990s, due to the rise in popularity of Warner Brothers cartoons and the huge success of Beauty and the Beast, Disney company sought a new product, and someone remembered that Walt had intended to do a sequel to Fantasia.  They dusted off the notes and original art and made a new movie, Fantasia 2000, which is a worthy successor but not at the same level.  Don't get me wrong:  The art is amazing, but the magic of the original or even of Beauty and the Beast is not as powerful.  Regardless, this collection is great because you get both movies in regular DVD and in Blue Ray for the price of one DVD.  You can't beat that.  This will be one you will see again and again.",1293580800,,1667,4.3462783171521036
4241084,5,B0040QTNSU,"""Fantasia represents our most exciting adventure"". Walt Disney. This statement is completely true. Fantasia is 70 years old and is still a bold experiment after all this years. Fantasia is not only an excellent movie, is an excellent experience. When you watch it and hear it, you are transported to a new entire experience completely different from everything you ever saw. Fantasia is the perfect marriage between music and images and a truly masterpiece. I think Fantasia was the boldest thing Disney ever attempted in his life (even more than Snow White). This film showcased great musical pieces and gave the animators an unprecendeted freedom to interpret the music and produce great animated images. Not all the pieces work as well as others but as a whole, Fantasia is something unique and beautiful that everyone should see at least once in their life. A classic masterpiece through and through. Now I will list all the segments and denote my favorites with an *.

-Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor: An abstract segment that opens the film with random animated images mixed with orchestra images. Beautiul lights.
-Nutcraker Suite*: An amazing segment that shows images of fairies, flowers and mushrooms dancing at the compass of Tchaikovsky's wonderful music.
-The Sorcerer's Apprentice*: The most famous and my favorite segment, shows Mickey Mouse in it most delightful role. Dukas's music is perfect for the story. One of the film's highlights. Simply amazing!!
-The Rite of Spring: One of the longest segments, shows Earth's birth and the life of Dinosaurs. The animation is amazing but the segment is too long for it's own good. Still is a good short.
-Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack: An unnecessary intermission paired up with a delightful segment about the soundtrack.
-The Pastoral Symphony: Beethovens's great music is paired up with a somewhat uneven segment. While I like the beginning and the middle, the end with Zeus is a little bit problematic. This segment caused a lot of angry reviews in this site because some seconds of animation (showing ""Sunflower"" the black stereotyped centaurette) were edited out. While I'm a purist and hate when people revised their original work (George Lucas on Star Wars) I have to say that this seconds were not central to the plot, the character is offensive and to boycott this amazing film because of this issue is just crazy. I'm not saying that this is right and Disney should have offered both versions with the original version being introduced by Leonard Maltin addressing this issue. Still, with this minor problem, you should see Fantasia because I think this will be the only version available forever.
-Dance of the Hours*: Many people says that this segment is especally ""for the kids"" but I found it delightful. A great composition with outstanding character animation, What else can you ask?
-Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria*: The most powerful two segments of the film, the first shows evil at its height. Chernabog is a masterful creation and one of the strongest characters Disney have ever created. Ave Maria on the other side is pure and the perfect way to wrap up a perfect picture.

Fantasia 2000 tried to fulfill Walt's dream to keep Fantasia an ongoing proyect through the years. Due to financial failure of the first film (unfortunate), this was never possible. 60 years after the premiere of the first film, Walt's nephew Roy Disney and Disney animators created a similar project entitled Fantasia 2000. Like its predecessor, it takes classical musical pieces and matches them with newly created animaton. While the principle is similar to the first film, its themes are different and is more family-oriented than the first. While the first had many abstact interpretations and loose stories, this one has a more cohesive narrative in its segments. Also in Fanatasia 2000 the animators used many animation techniques like hand-drawn, CGI and more styles and you can tell the difference. While I like the first more, Fantasia 2000 is a worthy succesor to the first and a great movie on its own. It's not quite an experience as the first one but come close. I have some minor issues with the film like its short lenght. It didn't have to be as long as the first but running only 75 miutes is really short to build an experience. Still, Fantasia 2000 is a great movie and is the only Disney animated sequel that I like (aside from Pixar of course). Like above I will list all the segments and denote my favotites with an *.

-Symphony No. 5: Beethoven's great composition is used to score an abstract segment much in the vein of the Tocatta segment in the first film.
-Pines of Rome: I love the music but the plot is a little bit weak. Still it ends in a very high note. Great use of CGI animation.
-Rhapsody in Blue*: Excellent segment with a unique style and unique story. Just amazing!!
-Piano Concerto No. 2 , Allegro, Opus 102: A nice story with an interesting animation style.
-Carnival of the Animals, Finale*: A short, funny and delightful segment with great music.
-The Sorcerer's Apprentice*: See my comments above.
-Pomp and Circumstance*: Marchs 1, 2, 3 and 4*: A charming Donald segment paired up with the tradional wonderful march.
-Firebird Suite-1919 Version*: My favorite of Fantasia 2000, this segment has a wonderful story of death and rebirth with great music that uplifts your spirit and sends you with a high note.

Fantasia comes to Blu-Ray looking absolutely amazing. Disney is a master on restoring their classics and this film is no exception. The picture is crystal clear with no artifacts, grain or other issues. Likewise, a new 7.1 DTS-HD audio has enhanced this experience in amazing ways. Sound is crisp and clear.
Unsurprisingly, Fantasia 2000, being a new film, is demo-quality in Blu-Ray. Picture is absolutely pristine and the new 7.1 DTS-HD Audio is a perfect compliment for the picture.

On the Fantasia disc you have three audio-commentaries. Two of them are carried over from the ""Anthology DVD Set"" but the third is an all-new one recorded by Brian Sibley. I'm not a fan of audio-commenatries but listening to some portions of each, they are very informative and fun to hear.
""The Schultesis Notebook"" is a featurette that covers the long lost notebook of Herman Schulthesis, the special effects supervisor that wrote in great detail about the effects on Fantasia. This featurette is very enjoyable and highly entertaining.
""Disney Family Museum"" is a presentation and promotion of the new museum hosted by Walt's daughter Diane Disney.
""Interactive Art Gallery"" is a new way to look storyboards, sketeches, stills and more for both films.

On the Fantasia 2000 disc, you have two audio-commentaries carried over from the previous set.
""Destino"" is the recently finished short that began in 1946 under the collaboration of Walt Disney and Salvador Dali. Is a wonderful surrealist short but is a little bit grainy.
""Dali & Disney: A Date with Destino"" is a very long but informative documentary about this two mena and their unlikely collaboration. Drags a little but has some very interestng facts.
""Musicana: Walt's inspiration for a sequel"" to Fantasia is a more entertaining featurette that shows the truncated ""Musicana"" which was supposed to be the successor to Fantasia and the proposed segements that would have been included in it.
Disney's Virtual Vault is a BD-Live feature that contains everything from the Anthology Set including making of documentaries, analisys on each segment and discarded scenes. While is great to see that everything was included, it's highly impractical to put everything on the net which will be erased in some time. BD discs can hold a lot of capacity and there is no excuse to not include this features in physical format. Besides, when you see this bonus material you can't wath them in whole screen, only a little window which is annoying. If you have the Anthology disc, you might want to hold into it for the time being.

DVDs for both films are also included in this set and while they look better than the Anthology set they don't have a lot of bonus material included and can't match the quality of the BDs.

Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are great films that you should really own. With amazing picture and audio quality and new informative bonus material this is a no brainier purchase. Some issues like the Virtual Vault and the edited segment are a little annoying but not to deny yourself of enyojing the classic film and its worthy follow-up. Completely Recommended.

Note: If you like to read a much more comprehensive review, I recommend Kevin Cedeno's review on DVDizzy.com. It's a great review which is also fun to read.

PD: You should know that Disney is planning to return this set to the ""Disney Vault"" on April 30, 2011 so you should get it while you can before the price gets really high.",1293408000,4,8866,4.920454545454546
4241085,5,B0040QTNSU,"Despite the ""censorship"" claims, I still give this blu-ray release 5 stars. The combination of classical music and beautiful Disney animation is not to be missed. Fantasia 2000 is fantastic and in my opinion, lives up to the high standard of the original film. The picture and sound quality is superb for both movies and to be able to own this on hi-def and see the beauty of the films is awesome. This is one of my favorite blu-rays that I own.",1293408000,,445,4.439024390243903

4241117,5,B0040QTNSU,"My first Fantasia experience was as a child, privileged to attend a special screening at the Academy Award Theater in Beverly Hills. This venue, owned by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, was equipped to show the film in the original Fantasound process. I have never seen or heard it like that since. In Fantasound a theme would actually accompany a character across the screen. It was nevertheless an unforgettable experience to be in the company of real genius (the composers, the animators and artists, and yes, Mr. Disney himself). The Blu-Ray version is perfectly gorgeous, the only way to see it better would be in a process currently called 4K, which will perhaps someday supplant high definition television.

What made this even more extraordinary was to hear it with an audio commentary that reminded me of attending a master class in musicology and animated film making. I thought I knew a lot about how the picture was made, but it turned out I had a lot to learn. I was mesmerized for the full 125 minutes. Regarding the missing fifteen seconds I would say to the purists, get over it. It wasn't necessary to include something that most intelligent people would consider offensive. This isn't 1939 and sensibilities have changed, thank goodness.

As far as Fantasia 2000, I loved in Imax and on the big screen. It is almost a completely different experience from the original Fantasia and has its own feel and charm. The Pines of Rome with the flying whales is simply a bit of artistic genius as was the interpretation of Rhapsody in Blue.

For those who don't feel comfortable with the cuts made in the musical content, I would say, anything that exposes young people to Bach, Beethoven, Gershwin, Mussorgsky and the others deserves our gratitude. I have my MFA in musicology and conducting. If I didn't find it a sin against the music, perhaps those who do should lighten up just a little. These are more than just movies, they are motion picture experiences and as such occupy a different level from most of what is out there. Please give it a chance.",1293235200,3,2082,4.761772853185596
4241118,5,B0040QTNSU,"Music, fantastic artwork and animation?  It all comes together in this set of DVD's.  The story is ageless and the music is the music of the ages!  There is no better way to enjoy the ""True"" Disney world.",1293235200,,204,4.315789473684211
4241119,4,B0040QTNSU,"I'll start out by saying the original Fantasia is a 5 star film and Fantasia 2000 is pretty good itself. As for the positive items about the set 1) the price is good for a 4 disc set; 2) the packaging is very compact and better than the original box set; 3)clarity-nice job on the transfer; not as dramatic change as there was from VHS to DVD but nevertheless an improvement. The bonus feature ""The Shulthesis Notebook"" is very informative and entertaining for film historian buffs. I could have taken more of this than the very long feature on ""Disney and Dail."" Which leads me to the negatives about this set; 1) Deems Taylor (the original narrator's voice) is missing again! This causes me major heartburn. You can read the internet elsewhere why this was done but it doesn't work for me--there could have been other options. The Sunflower editing doesn't bother me as much as replacing the original narrator with a guy that sounds nothing like the original. You can see Sunflower on youtube but Disney should have included those segments as a bonus. As previously mentioned the ""Disney and Dail"" documentary is long. The first 30 minutes or more are a bit boring if you know the basics about the two gentlemen. It does get better as it goes along. The actual ""Destino"" is good. It had so much legend to live up to it probably never could do so. Another real negative is the ""Blu Ray Live"" features; if you don't have your blu ray hooked up to the internet you're out of luck. Bad move on Disney's part. I haven't listened to the new commentary yet so I can't comment on that item. If you have the original Fantasia box set hold on to it. There is no reason to get rid of it because I don't think everything has been duplicated (certainly not if you don't have your blu ray player hooked up to the internet). There are more exhaustive reviews on Amazon and the internet but for me these are my major pro/cons.",1293062400,,1912,4.481375358166189
4241120,5,B0040QTNSU,"With the success of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Pinocchio"", Walt Disney Studios began working on a new animated feature length film titled ""Fantasia"".

Unlike the previous two films, ""Fantasia"" would incorporate live action segments hosted by host Deems Taylor (an American composer and music critic) but with the studio wanting to raise the bar even higher, the animators wanted to try more experimental styles of animation that has never done before and then time it to go with the music directed by Leopold Stokowski and performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra.

Because the film is more of a musical extravaganza, Walt Disney wanted the premiere to be a special event where there was reserved seating and it was a formal occasion in which people would get special program books.  So, in many ways, the film was like visiting a classic music concert versus a film.

""Fantasia"" would feature the following soundtrack:

  * Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor, BWV 565 (Johann Sebastian Bach)
  * The Nutcracker Suite OP. 71a (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky) which includes ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"", ""Chinese Dance"", ""Dance of the Reed Fluets"", ""Arabian Dance"", ""Russian Dance"", ""Waltz of the Fowers"".
  * The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Paul Dukas)
  * Symphony No. 6 (""Pastroal"") Op. 68 (Ludwig van Beethoven) which includes I. Allegro ma non troppo, II. Andante molto mosso, III. Allegro,  IV. Allegro, V. Allegretto
  * Rite of Spring (Igor Stravinsky)
  * Dance of the Hours from the opera ""La Gioconda"" (Amilcare Ponchielli)
  * A Night on Bald Mountain (Modeste Moussorgsky)
  * Ave Maria, OP. 52 No. 6 (Franz Schubert)

While the majority of the animation has no actual plot, among the most well-known animated segments include Mickey Mouse in ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"".  Mickey plays the assistant who takes his wizard's hat and by looking at his spell book, tries to make the brooms come to life and clean the castle (so he doesn't have to) but by creating so many brooms, the basin continues to fill up until a flood is created and causing damage.  While ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" is about the nocturnal Chernabog trying to summon souls from their graves as well as other evil entities.  Until the Angelus Bell sends them all back into hiding and transitions to ""Ave Maria"".

The film has received positive reviews since it's release in 1940 and even today as many are in awe of what was created at that time.  But because ""World War II"" was around the corner and Disney's success was due to worldwide release and the film being shown in many countries outside of the U.S., the theatrical version (which cost a lot to make back in 1940) and only shown in 12 theaters was not a financial success.  Re-released in 1942 and receiving a hack and slash edit from 125-minutes to 81-minutes, it was a commercial failure as the public were not used to accepting a Disney animated film as a classical music animated concert.

Fortunately in 1946, the film restored the ""Toccata and Fugue"" animation.  In 1960's, ""Fantasia"" would finally make a profit but because of the sign of the times, the film would become even more popular but that is because of the rampant drug use at that time and even Disney itself would release a psychedelic poster to promote the film.  The film would be edited once again for its 1969 release to remove the character of Sunflower, the centaur that was an African-American girl during the ""Pastoral Symphony"" and a racial stereotype that many praised for its removal but also annoying those who wanted an unedited, uncut version of the film.

The film would go through a major change in 1982 as the original sound negatives back in the '30s were deteriorated and unusable, a magnetic recording was done in for its 1956 release.  Unfortunately, the master was unusable in 1982 and thus Disney re-recorded the film's soundtrack digitally by an arrangement conducted by Irwin Kostal.  Deem's Taylors original narration was replaced with voice artist Hugh Douglas and also removing most of the live action pieces of the film.  Once again, sending fans of the film in an uproar, while audiophiles who enjoyed the digital recording by Irwin Kostal over the original audio enjoying the audio change/upgrade.

With technology changes in 1990, for the 50th anniversary of ""Fantasia"", Disney went back to the original Stokowski recording as they were able to digitally use the 1941 soundtrack to resemble the 1946 general release version.  Everything was restored with the exception of the 1969 racial stereotype removal.  In 2000, for the 60th Anniversary of the film, Disney also brought back the Deems Taylor visual elements and the intermission with the exception of the 1969 edit.

And here we are in 2010, for the 70th Anniversary of the film and for its Blu-ray release, receives a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio treatment, keeping with the most faithful version of ""Fantasia"" since its 1946 release with the exception of the 1969 racial stereotype edit.

""Fantasia"" was and still is considered ""Avant-garde"" and creatively artistic as the animators sought after experimental ways to raise the bar of animation.  It continues to be praised by critics and those who have watched the film and for nearly half a decade, remained a mystery on how the animation was created until a notebook created by Herman Schultheis (who worked for Disney's camera effects department) was found and is now currently featured in the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco (note: A documentary on the finding of Schultheis' notebook is included on this Blu-ray release).

The film was never meant to have an ending and thus for the film's 60th Anniversary, the 38th animated feature ""Fantasia 2000' would be created.  Although shorter in duration than the original, the film would stay within the same context as the original by visualizing classical music compositions with live-action introductions.  For this 1999 release, the introductions would feature celebrities Steve Martin, Quincy Jones, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Penn and Teller and Itzhak Perlman.

The new music would featuring James Levine conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with the exception of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" which would feature the original recording by Leopold Stokowski.

The biggest difference with this latest version of ""Fantasia"" would be the inclusion of modern animating techniques (CG) and trying to incorporate the classic style the original was known for.

Included in ""Fantasia 2000' are the following songs:

  * Symphony No. 5 in C minor-1. Allegro con brio (Ludwig van Beethoven)
  * Pines of Rome (Ottorino Respighi)
  * Rhapsody in Blue (George Gerswhwin)
  * Piano Concert No. 2 in F Major-i. Allegro (Dmitri Shostakovich)
  * The Carnival of Animals, Finale (Camille Saint-Saens)
  * The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Paul Dukas)
  * Pomp and Circumstance - Marches 1,2,3 and4 (Edward Elgar)
  * Firebird Suite -1919 version (Igor Stravinsky)

A major difference between ""Fantasia 2000"" and ""Fantasia"" is the inclusion of animation with a storyline.  In ""Pines of Rome"", a whale who is trapped in an iceberg tries to find a way out of it with the help of its parents, in ""Pomps and Circumstance - Marches 1,2,3 and 4"", Donald Duck and Daisy escort animals to Noah's ark but when the flood comes, both Donald and Daisy are separated and both fear that the other must have died in sea.  For the final dramatic piece, a spring Sprite tries to return the land back with plants and vegetation after winter but a volcano erupts with a Phoenix breathing ash and fire to destroy any living thing around it.  Will the spring Sprite and her companion, an elk, survive?

With ten years having passed since the theatrical release of ""Fantasia 2000"" and 70-years since the original ""Fantasia"" film, Walt Disney Studios are releasing a special 4-disc combo pack which includes a Blu-ray of both films, plus two DVD's of each film.

Also, as an added bonus, the Academy Award winning animated short ""Destino"" (2003) which was originally created by Walt Disney and Salvadori Dali and storyboarded alongside with John Hench back in 1946 and shelved for over half a decade and brought to life in 2003 by Roy E. Disney and director Domonique Monfery with the help of John Hench is included on this Blu-ray release along with the fantastic documentary on the making of the short.

VIDEO:

""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000' are both presented in 1080p High Definition with the former at 1:33:1 and the latter at 1:78:1.  First, the original 1940 film ""Fantasia""...  Having owned this film on VHS and then DVD, the only thing I can tell you is how awesome the film looks in HD.  The colors are absolutely vibrant and once again, you can watch this film over and over and still be in awe of what was created back at that time, it's amazing!  The contrast is very good, the blacks are nice and deep.  I did see some minor banding but considering the age of this film, by no means does it ruin your viewing of this animated classic. This is easily the best version of ""Fantasia"" thus far.

Now, of course, with ""Fantasia 2000', 60-years-later and the animators were able to combine newer CG animation with classic animation and thus with newer film elements compared to the original film, ""Fantasia 2000' obviously looks much better in HD.  The CG still holds up ten years later but if this film was created in 2010, who knows how much more detailed this whole film would have looked.

But both films look absolutely fantastic!  I didn't see any artifacting, nor did I see any major blemishes towards picture quality.  Fans of ""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000"" should be quite happy with this release!

As for ""Destino"", Destino looks absolutely wonderful in HD.  Salvador Dali and Walt Disney's creative and scrapped collaboration comes alive.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep but it's very important to note that this film does showcase Dali's experimental style and although there is no nudity, there is a animated woman naked and unusual but creative artwork that some parents may find objectionable.  So, parents be warned.  But otherwise, a wonderful inclusion to this Blu-ray release!

As for the two included DVD's, the film is presented in 1:33:1 aspect ratio (Fantasia) and 1:78:1 aspect ration (Fantasia 2000).

AUDIO:

This is where ""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000"" comes alive on Blu-ray.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, I was absolutely floored.  Reason being is that I have owned several versions of the ""Fantasia"" soundtrack.  Listening it on cassette and CD and typically, ""Fantasia"" was my meditation music throughout the '90s.  I've had this soundtrack play when I was working on my college notes, when I needed to just meditate and collect my thoughts and even to sleep, I absolutely love the soundtrack for this album.

But watching it on Blu-ray, I have never experienced ""Fantasia"" in this way ever!  Instruments separated on each of the seven channels, hearing audio going from left to right and right to left and hearing it so crystal clear and yet coming alive on a 7.1 system, I was literally amazed!

Both soundtracks with the Philadelphia and Chicago Orchestra just come alive in your soundscape with instruments being hear from all over.  If you have ever wondered how proper utilization of a concert or even audio Blu-ray using all channels would sound if properly done?  ""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000' is it!  Every instrument comes alive in each of the musical segments and simply, this is the best I have heard of ""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000'.  I know there are some people who are still stuck on the digital recording of the 1982 version by Irwin Kostal but if you have a 7.1 setup, you may just want to come back and listen to Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra come alive in his HD release of ""Fantasia"".  Once again, both soundtracks are fantastic!

As for ""Destino"", the soundtrack utilizes the original song from 1941.  You can hear that record player needle touch upon the vinyl and that vinyl coming alive in HD.  It absolutely works with this film and I'm so happy that they used that soundtrack and not clean it up.  The audio is properly integrated to that classic song that Salvador Dali was inspired by.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

As for the DVD release of ""Fantasia"", the film comes with a 5.1DEHT English, French and Spanish language track.  Subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.

EXTRAS:

""Fantasia/Fantasia 2000: 4-Disc Special Edition"" comes with a slip cover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I loved ""Fantasia"" and since the 1990 release, the music of the film really got me through college and throughout that ten years before the DVD release in 2000, I would watch the film over and over and just be in awe of how this timeless classic continues to surprise me on how it was created and how beautiful the film is and how the marriage between animation and music just came alive. Experimental animation at its very best.

One does not have to be a Disney aesthete to watch this film and just be appreciative of the details of how the animation is and how well-timed it was for the big screen.  It's an amazing testament to artists who wanted to push the envelope, raise the bar of animation to sights never seen before.  And this was in 1937-1940 and the results were fantastic.

Here we are in 2010 and if you thought you have seen or heard ""Fantasia"" in the best way possible, all I can say is prepare yourself until you watch and listen to this film on Blu-ray.  Audio-wise, this has to be one of the most incredible demonstrations of how audio and music can be used effectively with a 7.1 system.  As mentioned earlier in my review, I have had various versions of the ""Fantasia"" soundtrack which I have listened to in the past 20-years and until this Blu-ray release, I was literally shocked of how crystal clear and how effective the audio was utilized through the various channels.  Each instrument was given its own prominence on each channel and the results were incredible.

But granted, ""Fantasia"" is not the usual animated Disney film and also, it's not a film that is loved by everyone because it's not a story-based film.  As Walt Disney saw it in 1940 as an event to get people to sit and watching as if they are watching an actual concert, it all comes down to one's appreciation to classical music and in this case, classic Disney animation.

For the first disc alone, I could see this as an easy must-buy because of the audio upgrade, especially audio commentary tracks and the Schultheis feature but Walt Disney also gives you ""Fantasia 2000' and ""Destino"" in this 4-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray release.

""Fantasia 2000"" is a combination of CG-animation with classic hand-drawn animation that Roy E. Disney and company have done a fantastic job in paying tribute to the the original and continuing Walt Disney's goal of continuing the series.

""Fantasia 2000"" still manages to hold up well despite the 2000 CG but I enjoy the animation segments even more because they are story-driven and also sync up quite well to the music.  But when it comes to the music, both animated feature films are awesome in their own way.  The music selection for ""Fantasia 2000"" was a bolder selection with the inclusion of Gershwin, but for the most part, I am happy that it doesn't try to copy the original but mostly pays homage by maintaining the soul of ""Fantasia"" but presented differently with the inclusion of the celebrity introductions, story-based segments and more.

And as I enjoyed both films, the cherry on the cake for me was the inclusion of ""Destino"".  As I am a fan of Salvador Dali's work especially familiar with his work with Luis Bunuel, I did not know how close of a collaboration he had with Walt Disney until I saw the documentary ""Dali & Disney: A Date with Destino"".  What a fantastic documentary and just the fact that it's included in this Blu-ray is fantastic because we are getting three films showing us the experimental, the creative, the avante-garde side of Walt Disney Studios""within the last 60-years.

And just when you think that you are getting the best HD presentation of these films on Blu-ray and getting the best audio presentation of the soundtrack for both ""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000"" films, you also get a lot of special features.

At first, I was looking at the back cover of this release and it appeared that this Blu-ray release of ""Fantasia/Fantasia 2000"" would have very little special features but in fact, Disney decide to focus more on packing each disc with commentary on the first disc, and the ""Destino"" and its documentary on the second disc, that they saved all the special features for the BD-Live portion of this release.  And if you have a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player and it's connected to the Internet, then you can access the documentaries, story reels and more for both ""Fantasia"" and ""Fantasia 2000"".  I know those with older Blu-ray profile 1.0 or 1.1 players will be disappointed by this and would have hoped for a third Blu-ray disc with bonus features but the fact that you get four discs in this release (including the DVD versions of both films), I can see why Disney decided to add the special features to BD-Live, especially utilizing the technology more with this release than they have in the past.

Overall, ""Fantasia/Fantasia 2000: 4-Disc Special Edition"" is a fantastic release and if you are a fan of either ""Fantasia"" films or a Disney fan at heart, this release is highly recommended!",1292976000,6,24488,4.941711756025578

4241122,5,B0040QTNSU,"We all know how incredible this piece of animated history is.  Here are a few things I noticed that weren't on the video I previously owned,

- in the centaur sequence there is a rainbow/pixie frolicking in the water sequence
- Hippo / Ballerina sequence there is the bubble / elephant sequence
- Night on Bald Mountain there is some extra dancing of the minions in flames sequence

The Fantasia 200 disc includes an excellent feature length film about the not so surprising influence of Dali on Walts animation and their friendship and collaboration on ""Destino"" .

The film has been restored to perfection, now it seems all the more amazing, as Walt said ""I never regretted doing Fantasia, but I don't think I could do it again...""
I can't help but imagine if the film had ben more successful in its time what direction the studio would have taken instead of regressing with Dumbo and Sleeping Beauty.
Walt won a well deserved Academy award for advancement technology for work on the the sound enhancement for the theatrical release of the film.",1292544000,2,1134,4.688442211055277
4241123,5,B0040QTNSU,"Okay, I was ready to pan this release after reading all the criticisms that came out ahead of time.  However, I cannot do that.  Bummer!
AUDIO.  The audio of Fantasia is so important because it was recorded by Stokowski in 1939!  The original six-channel Fantasound recording was lost in 1955, when it was duped over the telephone lines, capping the top frequency of the sound and introducing hum.  All we have had since then is the two-channel remix done at that time, though efforts have been made to clean up and tweak that source.  I have always been sick listening to the sound of the 50th anniversary laserdisc and of the 60th anniversary DVD, because the audio experience was so much less than what Disney and Stokowski had offered to the 40 theaters which were initially equipped with Fantasound.  Well, I don't know how they did it, but the sound on the blu-ray is very good.  Only in the Toccata and Fugue section does one still yearn for a hearing of the original, undestroyed soundtracks.  Personally, I wish they had offered the option of Stokowski original on one channel and Kostal re-recording of the score on the other.  Kostal can't even be found as a soundtrack recording anymore.  If I am not mistaken, the blu-ray has returned to the original Deems Taylor audio track in the narrative sections?
VIDEO.  My 60th anniversary DVD once went bonkers and stretched the picture out to widescreen, and it actually worked amazingly well with this film.  So much of the picture is abstract that the distortion of the aspect ratio instead of a disaster was quite interesting.  Of course, the image quality of the blu-ray is superb, and one would never want to go back to low-res again!  The blu-ray is provided with two ways of viewing: the original aspect ratio with black bars to the side, or the original aspect ratio with triptyched side designs.  I liked the latter at first, but it got to be cloying after a while.  My TV has black framing, and the black side-bars blend well into the background, allowing the picture itself to stand out distinctly.  I think if a little more work had been put into designing the colored side-bars, they might have been more successful.  In other words, it wasn't a bad idea, but the execution was timid.
CONCLUSION.  This is as good as the image quality is going to get.  Some day Disney may deem to re-release Fantasia with a re-recording done in multi-channel sound.  While what is left of the original soundtrack should never be jettisoned, only a 5.1 re-recording with a full symphony orchestra will allow an approximation of the original experience.  Until that happens, this is still the best release of Fantasia yet.",1292457600,6,2673,4.738095238095238
4241124,5,B0040QTNSU,"Wow, I didn't even know there was a censorship scandal until I sorted through the reviews.  I saw Fantasia for the first time in 1990, long after the ""Sunflower"" bits were cut, so it was never a part of the ""classic"" for me anyway.  After just having watched the uncut version on YouTube, I can say I'm pretty ambivalent about not having it on the new Blu-Ray/DVD version.  I'd always wondered whether people might find the two zebra centaurs introduced with Bacchus offensive (though I thought they were pretty cool and wanted to see more of them) but despite being pretty open-minded myself, I thought Sunflower was in bad taste...not so much by the role she played and what she did, but how she looked.  Though I can see why film buffs and would want to preserve it, I'm fine without it.  I certainly wouldn't have returned the Blu-Ray if it was included, but I don't feel like I'm missing anything either.  If they've not released the uncut version by the time I have kids, I'll just show them the version on YouTube and start the conversation that way.

That said, I thought the rest of the restoration was well done, and I had my doubts about the restoration of the original Fantasia.  My last copy was the VHS b/c I'd missed out on the Anthology DVD release.  When I watched it on Blu-Ray this morning, I was blown away.  I didn't think it was washed out by any means, as a couple reviewers pointed out.  To that, I'd argue that adjusting the dynamic contrast on the set (particularly the blackness level) would fix the problem.  Some liens were still a little grainy and fuzzy, but I'm positive that was the animation style more than poor restoration.  There wasn't a lot of sharpness in the lines for the Toccata and Fugue sequence, whereas the snowflake fairies in the Nutcracker sequence looked like they were jumping right off the screen (and I was only watching at 720p/60Hz).  The crispness of Fantasia 2000 was light-years better (some scenes were positively hypnotic), but it had more advanced animation to begin with, so that was expected.

All in all, I was very happy with this release, and so happy to have it in the collection.  As for Disney's decisions?  I don't necessarily like that they did it, but I certainly understand why.  It's really easy to be an armchair liberal and tell them they should take ownership of their own history and be willing to release both versions in hopes of making everyone happy, but to do this would mean Disney would have to open a huge can of worms by acknowledging to the masses the controversy and why there are two versions.  It's a no-win situation.  No matter how in the right they would be and no matter how PC that explanation is, I'd wager money that the negative outcry over Sunflower would incite a larger and much nastier stir if she were released to the public than if she were not.  It's difficult getting many people to listen to reason when it comes to racism, and I just don't think we have enough people yet willing to view these 15 seconds as a valuable piece of film/cultural history as opposed to a perpetuation of an offensive stereotype.  My hope is this will change sooner rather than later, but for now, I think Disney just did what it felt it had to do.",1292371200,3,3235,4.541379310344827

4241138,5,B0040QTNSU,"I dimly remember seeing ""Fantasia"" in theatres as a child. Looking on Wikipedia, I see it was re-released when I was ten years old, so that must've been when I saw it. It doesn't seem that long ago, actually, and seeing it again now it felt just as fresh as it did back when I was a wee little lad.

The original ""Fantasia"" dates back to 1940, and it's an amazing piece of art. Each of the segments in the film is very well done, though the best in my opinion is the mix of ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" and ""Ave Maria"", a song so lovely it almost makes me want to forgive religion for its many sins. Almost. The animation is incredible in all the sequences and the sound, oh, the sound! Everything one can expect from such a film. I'll also confess to getting a mighty chuckle when the narrator mentions that ""The Nutcracker"" isn't performed much anymore. Ah, such a different time.

""Fantasia 2000"" is also a great film, but flawed on several levels. First, it's only 74 minutes. If you remove the really pointless celebrity cameos (and they are quite pointless. Who thought Bette Middler talking about music would be a draw to kids?) and the repeat of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" from the first movie, you've only got about an hour of new content. Second, while that content is generally good, none of it really stands out, except the ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and ""Firebird"" sequences. Lastly, there's the aforementioned celebrity cameos. But despite that, it's still a good movie and worth seeing.

As for the discs, the movies look and sound just spectacular! There's really nothing wrong with the transfers, which are crisp, clean and delightful! You also get a raft of extra features, plus DVD versions of the films, though strangely no digital download versions.

This is two great films at a great price. Disney could've easily decided to release them separately at a high price. I'm glad they didn't. It's a great value!",1292112000,2,1921,4.641176470588236
4241139,3,B0040QTNSU,"This is not about censorship, i don't really care about the black centaurettes.

HOWEVER, seeing as Disney has employed a ""multiple versions"" gimmick for nearly every one of their ""platinum/diamond"" releases, my expectations were sky-high for this release. I was eagerly anticipating the option to watch the 1990 version with Deem's Taylors original voice, as well as the 1982 version with the Irwin Kostal Score.

Why is it Disney will Insert a totally pointless and clashing song into ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", but not give us the historically signifigant alternate versions of Fantasia?

If you do not have the original 2000 DVD release, by all means pick this up, but if you do, this really isn't worth it.",1292112000,3,727,4.942622950819672
4241140,5,B0040QTNSU,"Some of us can remember a time not long ago when it seemed unthinkable that a classic Disney animated feature would be shown on TV at all, and with the rare exceptions of Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland (which was edited), they were not broadcast for decades but only reissued to theaters.

When home video came along, again it seemed out of the question that Snow White, Sleeping Beauty -- and especially Fantasia -- would ever, ever be released on VHS tape. Now it's become a nostalgic memory to recall the fervor that arose when, one by one, they all did become part of many home libraries.

The release of Fantasia was always an event when I was growing up because Disney didn't release it nationwide with a big ad campaign. It just suddenly appeared every few years in theaters and each time, seeing it was like living through a multi-sensory experience. It's not like a movie, per se, but more of a journey.

When it was issued on VHS, it was a huge seller. Surely Walt Disney, who was apparently disappointed throughout his life that the public never embraced Fantasia the way he dreamed they would, might have felt some closure. It was the success of the VHS sales that helped Roy E. Disney convince Michael Eisner to green light what became Fantasia 2000.

This new multi-DVD/Blu-Ray package combines both films for the first time. If you didn't get the DVD last time, do not hesitate this time because it should be in every home. If you want to see and hear it as never before -- plus finally get a look at the fabled Disney/Dali collaboration, Destino, this may be the thing that tips the scales in favor of getting that Blu-Ray player for a holiday gift.

There is nothing like Walt Disney's Fantasia, including its countless imitators. You never run out of things to notice with each viewing. And thanks to the generous audio commentaries and supplemental materials, you can gain an even greater insight into what a mammoth enterprise Walt Disney had the tenacity to take on. It was produced during a period when his artists were at the peak of their form and right before the strike and the war changed things forever.

Some of my own little notes about the original Fantasia:
Ever notice how many characters are waking up and going to sleep? What's that big blocky thing going down the hallway in ""Toccata and Fugue?"" (Even Roy didn't know.) How many action, horror and sci-fi movie scores must have borrowed elements of ""The Rite of Spring?"" And was I the only person in the late '60s/early '70s who burst out laughing during ""Dance of the Hours,"" not because of the funny hippos and ostriches, but because Allan Sherman used the tune for ""Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh?""

It's fitting that Fantasia 2000 is being reissued to the public after Waking Sleeping Beauty, in which we learned more detail about Roy E. Disney's pivotal role in turning the Disney corporate tides, and then seeing and hearing him as a major guiding force behind this film, which was very much a personal triumph for him.

The miracle is that such an ambitious project as Fantasia 2000 is excellent, too, combining reverence for the original film and its techniques with the newest innovations. How can you not admire the brilliant ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" the hysterical flamingos, the lush and lovely ""Firebird"" sequence, and the rest?

The live-action 2000 ""interstitials,"" though largely amusing to diffuse the stuffiness that one might have found in the 1940 Deems Taylor hosting duties, will probably date 60 years from now, too, with several of the celebrities being obscured by time and generations, but they are there merely for marquee value and are fine.

My only quibble is that Bette Midler seems a little too flip and dismissive of the early Fantasia sequences that were considered then dropped from the original. Nothing against her, but the segment comes across as if these lost concepts were all ""losers,"" reducing these ideas to mere eye-rollers, like the one about ""Salvador Dali and baseball."" It kind of flies in the face of the years of effort Roy put into restoring Destino and to the countless artists whose work was deleted for reasons other than ""dumbness."" It's a cute segment, and she is charming as ever, but it just seems a little insensitive.

The new audio commentary by the always welcome historian Brian Sibley is, as expected, richly detailed with endless facts about every minute of the 1940 film, along with mini bios on the artists involved. Some of it overlaps with earlier commentary from other historians, particularly John Canemaker, but if you don't have a Blu-Ray, you only get the new one and not the two earlier ones.

The two earlier Fantasia commentaries are wonderful because they feature Roy, Canemaker and ""2000"" Conductor James Levine on one, and Canemaker again on the other one with none other than Walt Disney himself in various clips, plus spot-on readings of his notes by an astonishingly gifted voice actor, who also redubbed Deems Taylor when the restored footage was found to be missing a lot of original audio.

[Note to collectors: If you have the three-disc Fantasia Collection DVD set, you'll probably still want to keep it, though, because there are still a lot of extras, like all the concept art and background materials, that were included on the Fantasia Legacy disc that are not in the new package.

The most touching moment, for me, came when the audio commentary for ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" started, and there was  Roy talking with Mickey Mouse, performed in the vocal persona who we have had the pleasure of enjoying for the past several decades. This was the Mickey I have personally witnessed doing radio interviews at various Disney events, filled with good humor and crackling wit. What a wonderful treat and what a irreplaceable treasure to have now.

So what's the big deal with Destino? Well, it is a big deal because it was considered unfinished and never to be completed. With the help of John Hench, who worked with Walt and Dali originally, and again Roy's dogged determination, it was completed with the original soundtrack intact (it's a Latin pop love ballad, by the way, sung by Dora Luz, who sang ""You Belong to My Heart"" in The Three Caballeros. It is strange? Weird? Disturbing? Nutso? Oh yeah! But how cool! And what a miracle that this once-in-a-millennium collaboration survived and we can actually see it at home!

One last note : on the commentary for the interstitials for Fantasia 2000, producer Don Hahn talks about the design of this otherworldly concert hall, with its ""sails"" carrying images around the frames (and on the selection menus).

How appropriate that a film that is so much a result of the teaming of Roy E. Disney with great Disney artists, past and present, should have ""sails,"" since sailing was his passion?

Along with Disney heritage and legacy, of course.",1291766400,12,6859,4.812234494477485
4241141,5,B0040QTNSU,"Before I begin this review I want to set the record straight because of some nasty comments on got my Shrek Complete story DVD release.

Please be aware that I am reviewing the DVD and not the 4 disc DVD Blu Ray combo pack. While yes the Blu Ray is a better buy because of the extra special features if you have a Blu Ray player it is worth the extra cash. Still, to me the only thing I was upset about was the fact that `Destino' the musical short that was a collaboration between Walt Disney and famous surreal artist Salvadore Dali is NOT featured on the DVD. I don't intend on owning a Blu-Ray player and personally I don't feel you need the DVD and Blu Ray of the same movie. Also all the special features of the Blu-Ray minus Destino are all on the DVD. So I prefer the DVD and you can see Destino on YouTube for free. Now, that we covered that on to the film review.

Disney is without a doubt the proverbial God of animation. His company has given us films that have shaped our culture, the movies we see and just remind us to never stop dreaming and wishing for your desires to come true. Now, from out of the Disney vault comes debatably his most original and boldest of all of his, now 50 animated classic. That film is Fantasia, and it is one of the few of his classics to treat us with a sequel.(That means it is not a direct to DVD film nor was it a Disney Movietoons film). For the first time, both Fantasia films are in a two disc set.

Fantasia is probably one of the greatest films ever made in all of film because of the fact that it was a project to show how music is able to create a story and project wild imaginative creatures and characters. It was also a film that paid tribute to the messages and stories that the featured composers portrayed in their musical platforms. The first film, which I still can't believe is over 60 years old has been cleaned up and re-mastered which unbelievable brilliance. First seeing the movie when I was 8 years old, while I did find portions of it to be very boring I was still amazed by how colorful and creative it was. The music is probably some of the most beautiful in all of classical music. While music is what drives these animated segments, you don't get names, but the music plays such an impact and drives the stories so well you know the faces of the characters. Probably the pieces that do it the best is the Song of The Hours and the Sorcerer's Apprentice.  Still, everything in Fantasia is wonderful and seeing it again after all this time reminded me of how great it is and while it really isn't a movie that should be seen by young children, it should be shared by all generations.

We move on to Fantasia 2000, which is one of the few rare classic sequel films in Disney's library. I had the pleasure of seeing this one on the big screen. It is a little different in some good ways, the only bad part about it is the fact that it is too short compared to its predecessor. It features animation in many different styles and also a few different styles of music besides classical. My favorite would have to be `Rhapsody in Blue'. The animation pays tribute to Al Herschfeld's unique artistic style and piece is a classical jazz piece by George Gershwin whos music has given life to many works of film and theater. The narration is also portrayed by a great group of actors and modern day composers.

Both of these films are great on their own and the special features on this film are definitely a secondary. These two films are two of the best if not two of the most important films in animation and to miss them would be horrible. Oh I know so many people made a huge stink about the Beethoven Sonata not having the 'Black Centaurs' in the film calling the film not the full film. I saw the cut scenes on YouTube and wheather there or not is completely meaningless to the film as a whole. If people are so bent on the whole 'Racsit' factor of Fantasia and that not including this is an insult on the African American populace of this country. Then go complain about the Disney company not releasing 'Song Of The South' on DVD.",1291766400,5,4104,4.289032258064516

I purchased this product ONLY for the Dali project because I am a high school art teacher.  How many high schools do you know with BlueRay (as under-funded as we are)?  NOT COOL DISNEY & AMAZON.

4241143,4,B0040QTNSU,"Fantasia has always been my favorite movie ever. The idea of combining art, animation and classical music is brilliant and the concept is wonderfully realized. It has been an immensely influential film in many fields; it's hard to believe that it was made in the late 1930s, only a decade or so after the first talking pictures. I like this new transfer and the brighter coloration. I regard the loss of Deems' voice as trivial (I don't watch the movie to hear him speak) and I can't really understand the fuss over the missing few seconds. Movies are cut for many reasons and it seems to me that removing material that might be found offensive (especially when it forms such a minute part of the movie overall) is far from being the worst of them.

I do feel that Disney has shortchanged the purchasers by not only cutting back on the extras but also by putting the short film 'Destino' only on the Blu-Ray disc. If the DVD purchasers aren't important enough to merit the additional material, why is it being sold as a package? For that reason I've only given this release 4 stars, but the movie itself is worth five stars in any company.",1291593600,4,1139,4.529126213592233
4241144,3,B0040QTNSU,"These comments refer to the regular DVD release (2010) of Fantasia, not the Blu-Ray version.

Image: I've no complaints about image quality, and since the visuals are the main reason most of us will be watching this film, the set automatically gets at least a passing grade.

Unfortunately, it's downhill from here.

Sound: As at least one other reviewer has pointed out, the surround-sound of this edition downmixes into something awfully close to plain old mono when played through a two-channel stereo system.  Stokie may gesture dramatically to the left, and then to the right, but the orchestral sound comes straight down the middle of the two channels just the same!  I've informed the tech types at Disney about this blunder, but have yet to receive any very meaningful response.  Ironically, the Deems Taylor interludes downmix into perfect stereo, as do the ads at the beginning.  Too bad they didn't get it the other way around!

Content: I doubt that many of us will watch Fantasia 2000 very often, and I suspect most would prefer to have seen a generous assortment of bonus goodies in its place.

As for Sunflower: I don't miss her, but sanitizing the past isn't very different from lying about it.  Anyway, surely Disney could have pleased everybody by putting her on an alternate track, or at least slipped in the censored extract as a bonus feature, or something.

I can also live with the Deems Taylor surrogate, but would it have been so dreadful to retain what survives of Deems' commentary, and use the voice double only for the missing sections of the soundtrack?

Considering this release isn't exactly cheap, I feel somewhat resentful about having to wade through a seemingly interminable series of ads to get at the main feature/menu.

Altogether, I don't regard this as a definitive edition of the movie.  But what is the alternative?  Finding a clean copy of the (also flawed) 2000 version is difficult and expensive, and the only other choice we have is to wait another ten years to see what the Disney corporation will do to Fantasia the NEXT time around (remember, it could be worse!).  So, I'm disappointed, but I still plan to get a lot of enjoyment out of the set.",1291593600,7,2195,4.797872340425532
4241145,1,B0040QTNSU,"Ok, so I guess most of the folks giving this just a star are mad that this is not the original version.  It's not that I don't agree somewhat with that, but however, what most seem to forget, is that in the United States, we are grated freedom from ""censorship"" of the government, NOT business or other non-government groups.  Under the current laws of the land, the same ones that guard against government censorship by the way, Disney can do what ever they want with their stuff.  If we were to crack down on them for that and tell them what they can and can not do, then ""family friendly edits"" (a thing I support) would be fully allowed as well as under the same logic, someone could tell other studios what to do with their films as well.  Frankly, this whole issue is steeped in hypocrisy and I think a bunch of people need to get over it.  This is the ""Fantasia"" I grew up with, move on.

No, I'm not giving the 2010 Blu Ray/ DVD release a single star over that issue, at worst if that was the only negative, I'd give it four stars.  No, I'm giving this release a low rating becuase Disney totally dropped the ball on this one.  First is the fact that after years of teasing Disney fans with ""Destino"" on DVD, they pull this ridicules stunt and make it a Blu Ray only extra on this release.  Then, the long rumored ""Fantasia World"" that would have included not only ""Destino,"" but a number of other shorts that would have been ""Fantasia 2006"" before it was axed, was dropped.

But that isn't even the worse part.  The same company that sold us all on how important ""bonus features"" are has done a crappy job of delivering them on many of their re-released films on Blu Ray, and this one may be the worst case of that.  For a film with such rich history, the bonuses on this release are about as bare bones as they could get it.  The original DVD release from about a decade ago had WAY more content that really gave the audience a rich historical perspective on this fine animated film.  I think the audio commentaries may be the same, but past that, NOTHING from the amazing 2000 release of either of these films has been carried over.  Huge mistake.

Then there is the films themselves, which is basically the only real selling point on this release theoretically.  I mean it should be about the movie and not the extras, right?  Well, while the digital restoration into HD works for ""Fantasia 2000,"" for the original, they really ruined it.  In this modern age where everything has to be HD quality, we seem to forget that while that is all great for modern films, old films, especially REALLY old films don't work the same way.  Disney's original five films for sure were always meant to be a little darker and grainier in picture quality.  The scarier moments like Snow White running through the forest, or ""Night on Bald Mountain"" were granted the more menacing, scary status that they had BECAUSE the picture was a bid dimmer and dark originally.  With the new Blu Ray versions, everything is lighter and almost looks like it was made in the last ten years or so.  That is not necessarily a good thing, but then again, there may be people who like that effect, I'm just not one of them.  I'm not saying that any film restoration for these films is bad, but I do think there is such thing are going too far with it and I think they did.  Again, the 2000 DVD is the BEST version of the original.

All in all, this whole release feels more like an after thought then the amazing release it should have been.  Disney could have had the most amazing Blu Ray release of one of their old films ever with a proper and more appropriate restoration of the original film, and with hours and hours of amazing extras carried over for the 2000 DVD release, as well as all of the lost shorts that would have been ""Fantasia 2006.""  Make ""Fantasia World"" available on DVD and this whole release would have been perfect, as well as give owners of the 2000 release serious reasons to go Blu for it.  Instead, they just screwed the whole thing up.  Watch them re-release this on Blu Ray in five to ten years and this time add all the original extras and some.  That would be very Disney.

Final verdict, if you don't have the 2000 DVD or you like how washed out the film looks on Blu Ray, try to find the 2000 DVD anyway as it is the better version.  But if you can't find it or it's too much, something is better then nothing, and at least owning this 2010 release gives you one of the most innovative animated films ever made.  But, if you already own the amazing 2000 DVD release, do yourself a favor and skip this.  With the money saved you can buy the ""Rapunzel"" Blu Ray later or get ""Toy Story 3"" if you have not already done so.  In fact, check out the 2000 ""Fantasia"" DVD here:

4241146,1,B0040QTNSU,Some of us are getting copies that are defective. Fantasia 2000 blu plays fine but the original Fantasia blu won't play after the promos (naturally). You may have a problem with this set.,1291507200,6,187,4.696969696969697
4241167,5,B0040QTNSU,"This is a classic Disney movie and it doesn't matter that the offending 15seconds is eliminated.  It uses timeless music - orchestral in nature - not just as a backround to the video, but as the premise for the story.  It should capture the attention of children of all ages because it is a collection of short stories - each only a few minutes long.  I am thrilled that it is being released and cannot wait to watch it again - by myself and with the grandchildren.

What a wonderful way to stimulate their imaginations rather than some of the lewd music and videos created today.",1291507200,,580,4.443396226415095
4241168,5,B0040QTNSU,"My only recent copies for both films were the VHS version, and Im quite surprised at how well the VHS version of Fantasia held up all these incredible years, like a trusty friend. Even so, even with this item now in my possession, I will not dispense of the VHS, I cant possibly be that cruel to a faithful buddy, but I will turn in the VHS copy of Fantasia 2000 to a local video store that buys your video or music disposables. So with that in mind, I am entirely delighted with the new version of Fantasia, and very glad they packaged it in a 2 movie collection with both movies that cut to the chase with no boring introductions of the package feature and its contents. I don't need a history lesson, thank you, and they don't have one tied into the main features. It goes straight to the movie catagories with great background music that wets your whistle for the upcoming animation filled concert.
I like the chapter episodes split up into either the standard introduction or the music animated segment itself. Great for the video DJ alive and well within me.
Fantasia is a bit longer from 120 minutes to 125 minutes not because of unedited animated footage, but because the dialogue from Deems Taylor has more commentary than the VHS version, which is ok because the additions are scattered throughout all his intros, which do not make any of them any longer than they have to be.
The sound quality is first rate and plays excellently on my home video set which was updated recently, and plays like dynamic butter. I am so glad I got this set before the end of the year holidays, and Im sure it will be greatly used in conjunction with my DVD video library which just grows like a blossoming rosebud.
The packaged box is as extreme as Disney's 3Dish hologram like Ichabod And Mr. Toad treatment, and will probably remain while other discs are stored in disc binders with the bulky container thrown away.",1291507200,,1909,4.520231213872832
4241169,5,B0040QTNSU,"I'm not going to repeat all the reviews on here... because there's one thing I think pre-buyers should know.
This re-release of Fantasia & Fantasia 2000 is probably the BEST you're ever going to see the movie, ever.
I had just finally gotten this in the mail a few days back and watched it.
Boy, what a big difference.
The new, digitally-enhanced, hi-definition movie is simply a pure delight to watch. Everything is re-mastered, which makes it seem like the movie was brand new.
The live-action sequences were great, gives the allusion that the actors are really there, rather than the original, all darkened footage.
The animation and color of each segment is very beautiful, but more than (let's say) the original VHS versions.
For example, the ""Toccata & Fugue"" sequence has been given more life & color into it, some scenes seemed to have brighter colors never before seen. And the ""Rite of Spring"" sequence was probably the sharpest of the pictures. With a brighter atmosphere, the darkness fades away and you are now able to see even more details (like wrinkles) on the prehistoric life. In the marine segment, you can pretty much see every fish on the screen, instead of hiding in the shadows.
If you are a good fan of the movie like I am, in order to enjoy it to the fullest, you would want to buy this one before it goes away. :D",1291420800,2,1339,4.606694560669456
4241170,5,B0040QTNSU,"The masterpiece FANTASIA remains important on several levels. From conception to execution, Fantasia is a Disney studio venture into the unknown that has endured the test of time. Just as important, it was and remains an American masterpiece. It incorporates avant guard imagery and technological innovation that brought classical music to a new standard of family entertainment. This was the first motion picture to utilize stereophonic-ish surround sound which in fact holds up remarkably well in comparison to modern Dolby soundtracks. Books and many scholarly articles have been written over the decades about Fantasia, so you certainly don't need further illumination from me.

This film was conceived with with the conviction that Fantasia was and would remain a work in progress. In the early 1980's the film was released with a new digital sound track created from scratch. The result was mixed since the original track, while not exactly ""high fidelity"" had a certain charm that could not be duplicated no matter how brilliant the orchestral performance.  Enter into the scene, FANTASIA 2000. True to Disney's original mandate that the film should continually reinvent itself with state of the art exhibition technology, 2000 is a worthy addition to Disney's ongoing ""work in progress"". Shot in the IMAX format and incorporating new digital animation, FANTASIA 2000 represented the pinacle of Film and Sound art as it was at the beginning of the 21st Century.

Addressing many of the reviews featured here, it should be noted that racism was simply a part of the international humor of its day. No offense was intended, at least not by the Disney Studio. In fact, FANTASIA was rather gentle in its use of stereotypes. Works of Walter Lang (Woody Woodpecker), Warner Brothers (Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs) and Max/Dave Fleicher (Betty Boop antics) were far more offensive by todays standards.

The only FANTASIA that I have ever seen had one questionable moment in portraying black centaurettes as zebras. The scene was cute then and clever  even today. I have never seen the notorious ""Sunflower"" seqence. I imagine it is as offensive today as it was mainstream in the era of ""Amos and Andy"".  This rather tasteless humor was never mean-spirited or hateful.  Disney was niether a hate-monger or a bigot any more than Al Jolson in blackface.  I think that to focus on this one issue dismisses the overall wonder that FANTASIA was and remains.

The Blu ray disc of Fantasia 2000 is stunning. So is the 1942 original. Since the original 35mm release had mediocre film grain and cell artifacts p we can view the Blu Ray release as a vintage old film presented in High Definition. Whimsically, the first run prints of the film never looked as good as its digitally enhanced counterpart. Nevertheless, a collection of both films in the ultimate reproduction format(s) is simply a continuation of Disney's concept. One day I have no doubt that we will see a 3-D installment.

If these films can fill your home with brilliant symphonic music, then it is worth the cost of admission on that point alone. 2000 will give your Hi Def screen a real workout. As a collection, this set should be seen as a must-have for any serious Blu-ray library.",1291420800,,3246,4.9833641404805915
4241171,4,B0040QTNSU,"The Blu-ray presentation is flawless (despite the censorship), I am amazed at the sharp clear details of the live action symphony & the brilliant colors of the animated sequences.  Disney out-did themselves here.

I have seen the uncensored version, and this is one of those rare times I feel the censorship is called for (but should be included as a bonus clip).  The serene pastoral mood would be shaken up by the appearance of the exaggerated black stereotype character.  For the sake of the overall mood set by the beautiful animation & music, i am glad it has been taken out.  I generally support the presentation of all animation in its original uncensored version, so I am not a PC prude, I am just thinking about the total effect it would have on the movie. In this case the censorship does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie, like it did with the Roger Rabbit movie & bonus cartoons.

But now comes my real gripe: when will we see the original ""3rd disc"" bonus material ""FANTASIA LEGACY"" released a decade ago on the 3-disc FANTASIA ANTHOLOGY box set?  I have to keep my original DVDs in order to see ""Clair de Lune"", ""The Ride of the Valkyiers"",""The Swan of Tuonela"", ""Adventures in a Perambulator"" and ""Invitation to Dance"".  Pencil tests of unused animation.  And then there are the Disneyland TV show specials about Fantasia that are included in that set ""Tricks of the Trade"", ""Plausable Impossible"", ""Story of the Animated Drawing"".  I know, the BD-LIVE feature takes you to their website where you can get most of these features, but for how long?  Don't think that you can put this BD in 5 or so years from now & expect to see those live features still up on a website.  Unless you have them in a disc, there is no guarantee you can see them years to come.

Instead we get a 3 minute promo for the Disney Family Museum (dim compared to the in-depth documentary made about the museum by a local TV station in S.F.) and some promos telling you how to take your Disney Movies on the go & why Blu-ray is better for you.

The bIg deal here is the inclusion of DESTINO, the long awaited & teased home video release of the Disney/Dali collaboration.  And it is not even included on the standard DVDs for those who do not have a Blu-ray player.  I was a little disappointed in Destino, it looks too much like computer animation which gives it a mechanical feel.

I still have to give this bare-bones presentation 4 stars for the beautiful restoration.",1291420800,3,2471,4.5292792792792795
4241172,1,B0040QTNSU,"Caveat Emptor:--Disney's 2 dvd Fantasia / Fantasia 2000 set does not contain Destino. They want you to buy a blu-ray player and shell out for a 4 disc pack for an 8 minute cartoon. Destino was originally to be a collaboration between Walt Disney and Salvador Dali, and famously one of the greatest unfinished films. Until 2003, that is. Since then the only place to see it is in large theatrical venues like NY and LA or art museums. Now it has become more than apparent it will never see a release on dvd after seven years of teasing and internet rumors. I bought this product for nothing. Without a blu-ray player or being in a major city, your best option to see Destino is a shaky mobile phone video someone uploads to youtube. Enjoy!",1291334400,7,738,4.474074074074074
4241173,5,B0040QTNSU,"Since there have already been so many great points made in regards to being for or against the 1969 edit of Fantasia, I will ignore that issue and instead focus primarily on the picture and sound quality of Fantasia and Fantasia 2000, as well as my love for the films.

If you have never seen Fantasia before, let me tell you that it is something marvelously different from other Walt Disney animated films.  It is an ode to art and classical music, combining and mixing the two so that brilliant animation tells the stories of the compositions, or invents new interpretations. It is the movie that I remember most vividly as a child because it is what first inspired me to become interested in music.

Since Fantasia is ultimately a movie about picture and sound, it also becomes the most enhanced by a stunning HD picture and lossless soundtrack.  Thankfully, Disney has done it once again and provided us with the most perfect Fantasia release ever seen.  The dancing toadstools practically pop out of the screen as they move along to the 7.1 surround sound mix of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite.  Mickey's famed Sorcerer's Apprentice scene dazzles with detail like I've never seen before.  That particular scene literally had me awestruck the entire time, mouth open in shock.  It looks SO CLEAR! It's amazing to me that after a year of experiencing blu ray I can still be shocked by a good transfer, but it happens time and time again when your age-old favorite movies become so pristine and perfect.  It's like watching it again for the first time.

Fantasia 2000 is a less memorable movie, but still offers some gorgeous music and animation.  ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and the ""Firebird Suite"" are absolutely classic, in my opinion.  The picture fills the entire screen and actually looks a splash more vivid than the 1942 Fantasia, if that's possible.  Anything that combines classical music and hand-drawn animation will typically get me excited.  Both Fantasias are perfect to play in the background while company is over or as you do chores around the house because even if you aren't experiencing the beautiful picture, the soundtracks are flawless in surround.

Bonus features are fairly slim, but Destino is an exciting addition that I plan on watching very soon.  Overall, though, Fantasia is my favorite Disney movie ever made.  If Walt had only made one film, I would have wanted it to be Fantasia.  It's breath-taking, it's artistic, it inspires... simply put, it's perfect.  And I'm so thankful that Disney didn't slack on the Blu Ray transfer, because frankly it's perfect as well.  I've only had the release a few days now, but already I find myself playing it over and over and over.  In the morning while I get dressed, when I get home from work, before bed... even if I'm not watching it intently, it's so comforting to experience in the background, knowing that whenever I look at the screen something brilliant will be there, illustrating the music.",1291334400,5,2968,4.849206349206349
4241174,5,B0040QTNSU,"As with most other reviewers, I'm a bit torn as to how high I should review this current release of Fantasia/Fantasia 2000.

First of all, there is the obvious issue with editing Sunflower out of the pastoral scene.  Yes, this is classified as censorship, but the cut was made for the greater good (of the film, of society, you name it) and has been omitted in the film for the past 45+ years.  While this type of African American portrayal (or any other minority for that matter) was typical of the time, there are a few other instances in Disney movies where songs/scenes are uncomfortable and eye-raising (such as when the carnies put up the circus tents and sing their {now a slap in the face} song in Dumbo).  Different era, different mentality.  Sure, other studios have addressed this time in animation/film history, but only Disney remains relevant.  I mean, would any other animated film from the 40s have this much selling power if it DIDN'T have the Disney name on it?  The Censored Eleven (for those of you going off about ""censorship"" but have no actual clue what you're talking about, look it up on wiki) should be locked up and really only used for the purpose of education, NOT entertainment as they were originally meant for.  Of course one could make an argument that such imagery was intended as empowerment through comedy and propaganda, but that's a completely different discussion and will NOT be part of my review of Fantasia/2000...

Second, I am not a fan of Dali.  I have degrees in art, I've studied Dali in Madrid, I *know* Dali, however I do not personally *enjoy* the Surrealist movement.  That being said, I think Destino is absolutely amazing.  Dali was in his element and Walt Disney was experimenting with film, animation, and music.  What we consider classic animation now was WAY ahead of its time and above and beyond what other studios were doing when Fantasia had its public release.  Destino is definitely a gem and should be treated as such.

And third, I do NOT understand the DVD release being shut-out of most of the special features.  I can understand keeping the hours and hours of extra commentary as a blu-ray exclusive, BUT keeping Destino off of the DVD?  Making the DVD discs plain without any Disney graphics?  What's with that?!?!  Unfair!!

Despite its many flaws, this latest edition of Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 is a fantastic addition to any blu-ray, animation, or Disney collection.  Seriously, just for the animation that pushes the envelope, the amazing colors and techniques, and the music... both the ground breaking original and it's less popular 'sequel' are keepers.",1291334400,,2628,4.8475336322869955
4241175,5,B0040QTNSU,"Fantasia is a beautiful movie, and it looks better than ever. To give this product a one star rating over a few seconds of material that was edited out is ridiculous.

Fantasia 2000 I would probably knock a star off of, but not because it isn't a beautiful movie, mostly because it kind of bugs me the way that most of the segments in Fantasia 2000 seem to have a storyline. In the original Fantasia there were a lot more abstract segments, and animation just existing for the sake of beauty, in Fantasia 2000 I feel like it could just be a silly symphony set to a classical piece of music. Also I wasn't crazy about celebrities introducing the segments. Mostly this movie feels like it was put together by a corporate committee. I view it as an added bonus to own it with Fantasia though.

The Five star rating is to try to offset some of the silly one star reviews that are bringing the average rating for this set way lower than it deserves to be.",1291248000,2,950,4.331460674157303
4241176,1,B0040QTNSU,"No Reason to by the DVD Version - Same Old Same Old

Disney REALLY missed the boat on this one! Big time. The Standard DVD version is no different than the previous releases except for a 9 minute documentary on ""Musicana"" that was to be the follow-up to Fantasia and a commentary track.

But the Blu-ray set has WONDERFUL stuff - I only wish I could watch it! They have released -on DVD for the first time - the wonderful animated collaboration between Disney and Salvatore Dali called ""Destino"". Until recently Park West Auctions (the one on many cruise lines) owned the rights as they were selling framed prints from the film (for BIG dollars). Finally it's out. Not only that but there is a 90-minute documentary too. But this is ONLY ON THE BLU-ray disc. How sad. Imagine how children could learn about modern art by watching this film when they learn about classical music from watching Fantasia. Disney isn't even planning to issue it on a separate mid-priced standard DVD. Shame, shame shame.

So if you have a DVD player, go ahead and spring for the set. I've seen Destino before (but only on cruises) and its great. And the documentary - not even available to reviewers in standard DVD format - is probably interesting. But, unless you have Blu-ray, pass on the Standard DVD. Maybe in a few years, Disney Home video will change their mind. I never thought I'd give a Disney product only one star, but that's the best I can do this time.

I've seen the uncensored clip and I prefer it edited out (the movie was edited numerous times, something most of the naysayers probably don't know). In any case, the reason I prefer this version is because the ""cut"" scene didn't fit at all. The humanoid centaurs, the beautiful environment, the masterful music that is Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, all fit perfectly. Then the goofy black centaur shows up for a few seconds just makes the film look dated, I guess it's a product of its time?-- but the rest of Fantasia looks, feels, and sounds so timeless.

If the clip was added back in, would I complain? not at all. But Fantasia is such a great film regardless and definitely one of Disney's best.

My only complaint (kinda) is that it comes with Fantasia 2000 of which I'm not a fan.",1291161600,9,903,4.567901234567901
4241200,5,B0040QTNSU,"After originally looking at this item and its reviews, I was worried that I wouldn't get the version I'd grown up with (I'm 26) - people were complaining about censorship and edits (one review said the movie was only 90 minutes long).  I checked the VHS I own - it's 120 minutes.  So, of course, I was concerned.

However, after looking into it, this seems to be one of the most complete copies that exists.  I looked for images of the back of the actual box - the running times are listed as 125 minutes for Fantasia, and 75 minutes for Fantasia 2000.  Both of these times are LONGER than their respective VHS times.  The original roadshow release of Fantasia was 125 minutes long, so it sounds as if everything has been restored.

This leaves the censorship.  The ""censored"" scenes haven't been in the releases of the film since 1969, so I'd never even seen them.  After viewing the ""uncut"" version on YouTube, I have to say that this is VERY minor, and I don't miss it at all.  The character of Sunflower (besides being very racist) is very jarring amongst the rest of the sequence.  She simply doesn't fit in, which was probably the original racist intention, but it disrupts the rest of the art.  Besides, in total, the cuts number a few seconds in length, and have no impact on the storyline.  I don't think it's that important - especially since OTHER black centaurs exist in the film.  (They accompany Bacchus/Dionysus into frame - they are the ""zebra"" centaurs, and in my opinion are some of the prettiest.)

Finally (and look down on this if you like), I read the release history of the film on Wikipedia.  The history confirms that this is likely the most complete release available (it mentions no differences between this release and the 60th anniversary edition).  We are also lucky that Disney was able to restore as much as it has, since there have been numerous problems with the film or its audio degrading.  The only other thing that hasn't been restored is the original Deems Taylor audio - the full audio track of the live action scenes (shortened in early edits) has been unusable for decades, so Disney had a voice actor redub it.  Perhaps in the future, new techniques will make restoration possible; but for now, be happy that the video has been restored.",1291161600,295,2280,4.612903225806452
4241201,5,B0040QTNSU,I cannot believe the extraordinary clarity of this film. It is like seeing it for the first time. I went to You tube to view the uncencored scene in the Pastoral symphony. I am a film purist but I think it was right of the Disney family to sanction the edit of those scenes. Very rude. No other way to put it. It actually ruins the stunning art that surrounds it. Pretty sick and inappropriate. There is positively nothing wrong wioth this release. The art is amazing and jumps off the screen at you. What a remarkable transfer! Technicolor rocks!,1291161600,3,547,4.48
4241202,1,B0040QTNSU,"I love FANTASIA.  I've seen it nearly sixty times, and hope to double this amount before I die - oh! sorry! ""transition"" - for those of you who are politically correct.

Last time I checked, at ager 67 I'm still a compassionate human being, a teacher and a writer who delights in the beauty and wonder FANTASIA's provided all of us over the decades.

What I do want to know is this: Disney's first dvd release of this title provided us with the
minimally esteemed ""roadshow"" version.  Unfortunately, since they did not have the Deems Taylor vocal soundtrack available for this version, they provided us with a ""ringer"", some guy impersonating Deems - and not well.

So...is this the ""theatrical"" version, with the actual verifiable reassuring Deems Taylor narratiin?

I know I'm not the only one here who grew up with the movie, so this review is coming from someone who is quite familiar with the source. In case you don't know, the pastoral symphony has been edited to where you cannot see a black centaur, and thats...about...it.
Even in the original cut, that centaur I spoke of earlier is only on screen for about fifteen seconds if even, and that is all that really has been trimmed. When first reading these reviews, I was not aware if I had grown up with the censored or uncensored version of the movie, but upon watching it i found out something else. The original version of fantasia has been recut and edited multiple times since 1969, so there's little chance anyone anyone below the age of forty grew up with the uncensored version. I understand that people dislike changes to movies they've grown accustomed to, but this really isn't that different.
Anyway, I'll end my review on this note. If you grew up with fantasia as i did and don't have a vhs version, or just have seen it once and enjoy it then i highly recommend getting the dvd version.

4241205,5,B0040QTNSU,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray release. Because Disney HAS made some blunders in the past regarding video releases, I had a queasy feeling when I started to read all of the negative reviews, and was worried that they may have ruined what is perhaps my favorite movie of all times.  But I couldn't NOT have the film on Blu-Ray, so I purchased it.  Throughout the 125 minutes, I had the same drop-jaw, WOW feeling that I have not experienced since I first saw the film in the theater in 1977 (and I have watched this on various video formats probably over 100 times).  Having studied Disney animation from an artistic and historical perspective for over 20 years, I consider myself to be somewhat of an ""amature Disney expert"".  Here are my responses to the ""negative press"" that this release is garnering:

The ""censorship/editing"" concern - OK, one character has been removed using digital scan techniques.  This caracter is ""Sunflower"", a black ""servant"" psuedo-centaur (in the ""Pastoral"" sequence), drawn as a crude caricature, who has roughly 10 seconds of screen time. As much study of the film as I have done, I did not even know of the character's existance until all of this ""controversy"" came up (I checked it out on YouTube after the fact).  I consider myself to be both a ""Disney purist"" and not especially ""PC"" - but I DO believe the decision to retain this cut (made in 1969 and not seen since) was correct. Even seen through the lens of what was ""acceptable"" in 1939, I found this characterization to be uncomfortably embarrassing.  Disney Studios made the wise choice.

The ""re-recording"" of Deems Taylor's voice concern - This actually had me more worried than the ""Sunflower"" issue - until I saw the video.  The simple fact is that the master audio tapes made 70 years ago have been unusable for nearly 30 years.  Previous releases of Fantasia on video have been based on the re-recorded track that had significantly abridged the original Deems Taylor introductions.  Disney was faced with the choice of either using the abridged narration with Deems' voice, or to use the original version with a modern actor ""looping"" the voice.  They chose the latter, which I strongly believe did a better service to restoring the film than the former would have been. The syncing is so well done that only someone who knows Deems Taylor's voice would realize that it had been dubbed. I was blown away by how much narration that I had never heard before!

Bonus features - OK, I do have to agree with some of the complaints here.  There is a vast amount of additional material that is accessable only if you have an internet-connected Blu-Ray player. I do not, and I feel somewhat cheated.  Fortunately, I have this material on a previous DVD release, but given that this is the ""definitive"" archival release of the film, I would have been more than happy to spend an extra ten or fifteen dollars to have this material included.  On the plus side, FINALLY having the Disney/Dali ""Destino"", and an excellent documentary to accompany it, does make up for the lack of previously released material.  I feel sorry for people who have only a DVD player that they cannot see this material as well. Additionally, ""Fantasia 2000"" has been included in the release.  Although an inferior film in almost all regards, it is still nice to have an exceptionally clean version on video.

Other observations - The picture quality is beyond amazing!  I have seen details that I never even knew were in the film, and even at only a few feet from my 35"" HDTV, the image is clearer than I even remember from the theater.  This alone is reason to purchase the video. I might add that the DVD version is also a marked improvement over previous DVD releases. Likewise, the sound is as good as it has ever been.  The original Stokowsky recording has been used, with excellent stereo/surround separation, cleaned to a pristine condition.  It must be remembered that this was recorded 70 years ago (when 78rpm records were ""state of the art""); listen to ANY other film from that era and you will see that they just cannot compare (although the recent Blu-Ray releases of ""Snow White"" and ""Pinocchio"" do come close).

In closing, I have to commend Disney for doing an outstanding job in bringing what is arguably the finest film ever produced by the studio to home video in a magnificent package.  Thank You!",1291161600,8,4384,4.7204724409448815

4241227,1,B0040QTNSU,"This is a major revision of an earlier review, updated to reflect the just-issued Blu-ray edition. (The original is not in this group, because Amazon changed the title of the disk, so it appears with a ""no longer available"" heading. You can find it by browsing my reviews. It was written early in 2010.)

IMPORTANT  On my Sony BDP-S550, which is probably a bit faster than average loading a BD, ""Fantasia"" takes forever to bring up the top menu. I wasn't sure if the player or disk were defective. I give you Alton Brown's advice about cooking -- walk away, just walk away. Your patience will be rewarded.

I was among the first to post a negative ""Don't you dare continue to censor this movie, Disney!"" Unfortunately, it remains censored. I suggested to Disney that the original scene be available as an alternate-angle view, but they didn't listen. I object to sweeping something under the carpet and pretending you never did it. In a country that values freedom of expression, this form of self-censorship is worse than the obnoxious thing being censored.

Let's talk about the new Blu-ray. I'm more than ever convinced Disney is altering its classic films in ways that will make them more-pleasing to modern viewers. This is sometimes an improvement, because you see things that weren't visible in the original Technicolor prints. This, of course, raises the question of what /was/ intended to be seen.

""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" have always struck me as dark, almost grungy-looking films. I'm not an artist, and don't know the adjectives (if there are any), but Disney's pre-'50s films often look as if the cel paints had been smeared on with a trowel. The images often have a ""heavy"" ""muddy"" (???) look I've always found displeasing. (I've been watching Disney animation for 55 years.) ""Fantasia"" now seems almost preternaturally clean, to the point where it sometimes looks like a completely different film.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I enjoy seeing additional shadow detail -- and detail in general. But ""Night on Bald Mountain"" has lost most of its darkness. Though one can better appreciate the animation and art, the sequence is no longer quite so creepy. I suspect Bill Tytla was aiming for a greater sense of ""mass"" in his Chernabog, much of which seems lost in this new transfer.

Complaints have been raised about Disney ""goosing"" the saturation. This /does not/ seem to be the case with ""Fantasia"", as scenes which ""should"" have a subdued color palette /do/, while the ""Pastoral"" -- which Disney allowed his artists to go wild with -- has eye-popping color, especially the rainbow.

I've discussed these issues ad nauseum in other reviews, so I won't belabor them here. Suffice it to say that, as with previous Blu-rays, Disney's animated classics do not look as they did in the theater. Whether they come closer to what Disney /intended/ is highly debatable.

The film itself remains a flawed classic. Though originally intended to restore Mickey Mouse's fortunes (as a short subject), it was also a showcase for animation, and a way of introducing classical music to the great unwashed. I am one of many people who date their initial interest in ""the classics"" to ""Fantasia"".

The film is narrated by Deems Taylor, a well-known and respected music critic and writer. The original narration was long and boring, and was later trimmed to the terser version we were familiar with prior to the DVD set. The original full narration was found, but the sound for the edited-out parts was missing. The DVDs used a modern speaker to replace Taylor's voice. Unfortunately, the ""complete"" narration has been used for the Blu-ray.

The conductor is Leopold Stokowski, who held a pop-culture position not unlike Leonard Bernstein's. He remains one of the all-time-great conductors, and he was at his peak when ""Fantasia"" was made. The set is worth owning simply to hear him conduct ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (best performance I've ever heard -- by a mile), the ""Nutcracker"" excerpts, the ""Dance of the Hours"", and ""Night on Bald Mountain"". The opening piece is his highly Romanticized version of Bach's ""Toccata and fugue in d"", and it has never received a kitschier or more overblown performance than it does here. (That's a sort-of compliment.) I'm not so offended by his ""Rite of Spring"" as others are. Considered as a piece of abstract music (rather than as a ballet), a case can be made for his approach. What is more objectionable is his cutting and rearrangement of the work's sections.

If you have the ""Fantasia Anthology"" DVDs, /do not/ get rid of them. It has the sound recordings for unused segments. One of them is Stokowski conducting Sibelius's ""Swan of Tuonela"", and it's amazing. Stokowski had an uncanny ability to slow down the music to a near stop without becoming ""mannered"" or losing the forward momentum, and we hear it here to amazing effect.

Visually, it looks better than ever!  The color registration which was bad on the 60th Anniversary/Anthology edition has been fixed, and the graininess of that edition is gone.

The only issue I found was with ""Ave Maria"":  the candles that the nuns are carrying now look like solid *pink* lollipops instead of the yellow glow of candles.

Still has the dubbed Deems Taylor interstitials.  :(

I watch most of my DVDs on my computer.  Normally, the surround sound will mix down to standard two-channel stereo.  This new version with the 5.1 soundtrack mixes down to MONO for standard two-channel playback.  The exception is the interstitials and menu, which do play in two-channel stereo, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence on the Fantasia 2000 disc will also play normally in two-channel mix down, however it's the old soundtrack from 2000, drenched in reverb, not the new soundtrack.

Regarding the 7.1 Soundtrack: It only plays in mono on a 5.1 home theater! The only way to get surround sound is through the French or Spanish soundtrack. They didn't include an English 5.1 soundtrack, and the 7.1 version is incompatible. I have other Blu-Ray discs with a 7.1 soundtrack and they play just fine in 5.1.  Another downside is that Disney did not release a soundtrack CD featuring this new restoration.  :(

I think blu ray shows its upgrades best on animated movies, and am thrilled to add these to my collection.

If you've somehow never seen either movie before, Disney takes a beautiful piece of classical music and finds the right animation to bring it to life and really allow adults AND children to appreciate the music in a new way.  It proves that you don't NEED words to tell a story.  My personal favorites include the oh-so-controversial Pastoral scene, the Nutcracker segments, Rhapsody in Blue, the Firebird Suite, and the Pomp & Circumstance ""Noah's Ark"" - which I thought was a BRILLIANT use of this classic march.

I am so disappointed to see how many people are upset about the ""hacking and slashing"" that ruins this entire movie for them and makes them lower the overall rating.

4241230,1,B0040QTNSU,"The increasing numbers of negative reviews should send a clear message to Disney: HANDS OFF! NO CENSORSHIP!

This edition, being censored, begs the question... Did anyone over at Disney Studios consider asking the question, ""What would Walt Disney want?"", ""What Would Walt Disney Do?"", or did anyone consider that if Walt Disney had found the sequence objectionable at an earlier, supposedly more buttoned down period of time, that he would have cut the objectionable portions at THAT TIME?!? If the film was acceptable to Walt as it was when it was released, then LEAVE IT ALONE!

Who or whom on what committee felt that they were granted the permission to rewrite this work of art in their own, biased vision where censorship is acceptable? Censoring a sexual innuendo out of this beautiful, classic film is assuming power that was never granted. Would anyone actually consider getting out a brush and a tube of paint and changing the bust line on the 'Mona Lisa' in the interest of sensitivity and assume that Leonardo Da Vinci would be alright with the decision? What if Michelangelo's 'David' was altered and 'improved' with clothing, lest some museum going child see a nude human figure carved in marble? Why should anyone accept anything other than the product that Walt Disney produced? The task at hand for the powers that be at Disney Studios was to produce an incredible Blu Ray reissue of this classic film, NOT re-edit it in their own fickle bias, so-called politically correct vision, and reckless self empowerment.

Let the market decide. I plan on skipping it. No sale. I would love to own this film on Blu Ray, but NOT a CENSORED version. Given that this is a masterpiece of animation and music, what level of self-aggrandizing individual assumes that they can just censor it?! The adherents to the integrity of the original, WANT the ORIGINAL. The bottom line: Why not just simply PRESERVE WALT DISNEY's original vision and ENHANCE the IMAGE QUALITY with which that vision is presented?!?!

It's classical music along with animation of the artist's feelings on the pieces. I find it great for kids of all ages. FOr younger children the music and soft animation is soothing, especially for insomniacs in the making. Once children get older it's a form of education with both beatiful and funny sequences. Even Fantasia 2000 was good, I love them both equally.

To the collectors and nerds, I give you a big right there with you. But you gotta remember that Disney is a kid oriented foundation standards change over time, so what was beautiful and artisic 50+ years ago is offensive today. We have to accept that we'll only be able to view things like editted sequences and Song of the South in dark dusty vaults because most of the world isn't ready to see that. So don't give this still magnificant movie a 1 star jsut because they've editted a few scenes here and there. We're not rating Disney we are rating a product.

4241232,3,B0040QTNSU,"If you're looking for the highest quality presentation of Fantasia available, this is the set to purchase. The Blu-ray versions of both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 in 1080p are positively beautiful. Crystal clear animation with no discernible artifact (banding), lush grays and blacks, and the artistic beauty of Disney's animators at their best is featured in these two extravagant movies. And yes, the movie has been censored in that we're missing a portion of one frame for a few seconds thanks to some overanxious lawyers at Disney, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying what are otherwise superb video presentations. (One star lost to the censorship issue).

There's an additional downside. The prior release of this set was the Fantasia Anthology. This was a DVD (not Bluray) release with three discs. You'd not be faulted for thinking: ""That set has three discs. This one has four. This one, therefore, has more content."" You would, however, be wrong. In both sets, one disc is Fantasia and one disc is Fantasia 2000. In the Anthology, Disc 3 is Fantasia Legacy, a bank of hours of supplemental features. In the new four disc set, Disc 3 is simply a DVD (non Bluray) of Fantasia while Disc 4 is simply a DVD of Fantasia 2000. Where did the Legacy supplemental material go? It's now on BD-Live in the ""Disney Virtual Vault."" So the picture resolution and overall quality has deteriorated AND you get to wait for the BD-Live connection to come to life AND you're counting on Disney making this available for the life of the disc (e.g. forever) which may or may not be the case.

Fantasia lovers out there will therefore want both the Bluray set here for the best possible presentation of the movie AND the Anthology 3 disc set for the supplemental feature disc.

I have Bluray. Why would I want two discs for an older format? Why wouldn't I want the supplemental disc that was included on the earlier set? Another star lost for a bad marketing decision by Disney.

I feel terrible giving this wonderful movie three stars, so let me underscore that the movie gets 5 stars as one of Disney's all time best works. The dropped stars are for hypervigilant attorneys and the transition of supplemental features to BD-Live instead of providing them as part of the overall package.",1291075200,235,2281,4.796437659033079
4241233,5,B0040QTNSU,"I'm not going to disagree with anyone against censorship. I hate it too, and if left to it's own devices it could be the demise of everything we hold sacred.

However, Disney deserves a pass on this one. Fantasia is a film we should share with our kids today, and we shouldn't have to explain why one little centaur has become a controversial piece of animated history, simply because the kids won't understand why until they understand the history behind it.

And, seriously, omitting this scene does NOT destroy the entire integrity of the film, like some would have you believe.

The bottom line is that this film has never looked better than it does on Blu-Ray. Not even on Laserdisc, which I did own.

It was a masterpiece in 1941, and it's a masterpiece now.

And it even has an animated short by Salvador Dali, which is amazing.

Who other than Disney could give you that?

So all the naysayers need to focus their attention elsewhere and leave this set alone, to be purchased by people who will appreciate it as the classic it will always be.

Maybe focus their attention back where it should be....on having Disney restore and release an unedited, more adult packaged edition of ""Song of the South"", where I will gladly jump on the film purist bandwagon.",1291075200,7,1263,4.632286995515695
4241234,3,B0040QTNSU,"The Almost-Masterpiece: It was easier for me to find the merits of the first Fantasia after viewing Fantasia 2000, having seen the first after nearly 20 years and the latter since it first came out on DVD in 2000.  Fantasia is certainly the superior, not by virtue of its having come first, but because it was rather audacious in going from abstract animated segments to more representational animation derived from Greek pastoral and mythological scenes, then to the very bold and praiseworthy depiction of evolution from single-celled organisms to the dinosaurs (and then to their eventual extinction), and then to the very eeriely pagan segment of ghouls and demons dancing in the palm of a giant winged Satan, only to be dispersed by an equally eerie procession of shadows carrying dim lanterns and singing Ave Maria.  These are what make the film more remarkable in terms of subject matter.  All the segments are equally exemplary in terms of the animation, however.

**Regarding Sunflower, the black centaurette: there seem to be two objections to be made on the presence or absence of this character, and the basis of the first is historical while the second is aesthetic.  I purchased the film today and the black centaurette known as Sunflower is indeed edited out of the Pastoral Symphony segment.  But having read in advance customer reviews which claimed knowledge of the omission, I managed to track the original clip online.  (This is easily done, by the way.)  The caricature is certainly horrific and dehumanizing and it should not be forgotten that not even Disney was immune to the disgusting prejudices of the time.  On historical integrity alone, therefore, frustration over the omission is more than understandable. (And I certainly don't intend to put the case lightly by saying so.)

On the other hand, what the film gains historically by Sunflower's presence is rivalled only by what it gains aesthetically by her absence.  The ill-conceived caricature of the black centaurette is the only blight on an otherwise remarkable piece of animation.  Shifting between the original Pastoral Symphony and the purged version, the presence of Sunflower is truly shocking and totally superfluous to the overall mood of the piece.  I am honestly baffled as to how the animators justified this revolting parody on artistic grounds, unless unapologetic racism was so commonplace and second-nature in those days (unpleasant, but very likely) that caricatures like Sunflower were being drawn left and right without a second thought to whether or not they harmonized aesthetically.  Edit Sunflower out, however, and one is able to appreciate the segment.

But for those who accuse Disney of trying to deny this embarrassing part of their history by the omission, that grievance is addressed in this release of Fantasia.  In part, at least.  There is an audio commentary by Disney historian Brian Sibley, and during Pastorial Symphony he brings the viewer's attention to some scenes of the segment which are grainier than the rest as a result of the image cropping done in order to omit the offensive caricature.  I haven't listened to the other audio commentaries or watched the special features (6+ hours in a 24-hour period is time I don't have. Sorry.) but the issue might very well be addressed there, too.

Of course, the choice is yours.  If a work of art is confined to the hands that made it at the time that it was made, then you're not likely to overlook the gruesome prejudice of the caricature.  But if a work of art has an existence independent of history then the defects may be excised and what is worth having artistically may be salvaged.

The Half-Masterpiece:  In spite of displaying animation techniques which were state-of-the-art on the cusp of 2000, Fantasia 2000 is unfortunately a degraded product compared to its predecessor.  For a start, the segments are introduced not by a single individual like the original, but by celebrities such as Steve Martin, James Earl Jones, Bette Midler, and Penn&Teller who all make strained attempts to be humorous and engaging but end up bringing down the tone of the film significantly.  (Were they there to make the film accessible?!)  Whether this is due to the celebrities innate mainstream draw is irrelevant as their performance would have to have been tailored anyway to fall in line with Disney's transparently lame attempt to market the second installment of the concert feature to a young audience.  From trying to capitalize on the short-lived vogue of yo-yo tricks in the late '90s to the shameless consecutive flogging of trademark Disney characters, the producers seemed far too intent on renouncing the mysterious, eerie tone of the previous Fantasia.

Producer: ""Oh, do include The Sorcerer's Apprentice!  Mickey Mouse is in it.  Everyone knows and loves Mickey.  Oh, hold on.  I almost forgot: that's a tale involving sorcery. That's hardly wholesome. Let's see....  Okay, no problem.  We'll follow Sorcerer's Apprentice immediately with a Biblical story featuring Donald Duck. It's the Bible and it's yet another trademark Disney character. They won't think twice about the sorcery bit!"" [guffaw]

A Note on Destino (the Utter Masterpiece): The segment that might have made it had it not been too bizarre was the segment that ought to have made it because it was so bizarre and so beautiful.  Barely 6 minutes long, Destino has more integrity artistically than either of the Fantasias combined. Why Disney doesn't strive to make feature-length films of this caliber mystifies me.  Dull PC garbage like The Princess and the Frog and the newly released Tangled have nothing on this elusive masterpiece. Why won't Disney have more of the same courage it took to pursue Destino?",1291075200,2,5760,5.076433121019108
4241235,5,B0040QTNSU,"For those of you who may be reading through the other reviews here on Amazon, and being turned off of this product due to all of the complaints of so-called ""censorship"", I feel the need to set things straight. You are not being told the whole story by the angry one-star reviews.

First of all, the missing (approximately) 15 seconds from the film has been missing since 1969. Most of us probably weren't even born at that time. So it's not like this isn't the Fantasia that we grew up with. Besides, Fantasia has undergone many edits over the years. The original theatrical version was only 81 minutes long (and included the 15 seconds of racism), the version on this new blu-ray/DVD release is 125 minutes (and does not include the 15 seconds of racism, but has 44 minutes of footage that has been restored since the original release). There have been almost a dozen re-edits of Fantasia since it's release in 1940, most of them to restore and repair lost or damaged footage, so making a big deal out of losing 15 seconds is redundant.

More importantly, if you actually saw the 15 seconds of edited film that has caused such a stir, you'd understand the need to remove it (by the way, if you're curious enough you can find the missing scenes on youtube, or do a google image search for ""Fantasia Sunflower"" to see the black centaur). This is no small offense. The Pastoral Symphony scene is packed with beautiful skinny centaur girls of many different vibrant colors, all with perfect bodies (at least the non-horse part) and long flowing hair. Of the many colors of centaur there is only on black one, and this one black centaur also happens to be short and goofy looking with crooked teeth, big hips, messy matted hair, and huge pail lips. To top it all off, she's clearly the servant to the other female centaurs, we first see her giving a pedicure to another centaur and then happily breathing on her hoof to polish it off like a good slave. She decorates her master centaur's flowing tail with flowers only to get comically slapped in the face by it when the master runs off to see the male centaurs coming. The last we see of her she is dutifully walking behind her master carrying a string of flowers worn like a gown. There's no doubt about it, this is racist as hell. The argument over this content is not whether or not the content is racist. We know, with absolute certainty, that it's racist. The argument is whether or not it's okay to excise it from the film.

Now I understand the need to preserve even the worst things in history, in fact, it drives me absolutely insane how many people completely disregard the fact that the founding fathers of this country were slave-owners. Just because this is a dark and abhorrent side of our history does not mean it should be ignored and that it shouldn't be in our children's school textbooks, this is stuff they shouldn't have hidden from them. I also don't think it would be okay to ban any re-release of the classic silent film ""Birth of a Nation"" even though it contains some of the most atrocious racism ever depicted on camera (and in a positive light, no less), it's still an important piece of cinema history and the controversy only makes it more interesting. And I even find it completely ridiculous that Disney has not yet released ""Song of the South"" on any recent home video format, albeit with an introduction/disclaimer to remind people that it's a product of a different time.

Be all that as it may, Fantasia is a different story, unlike the stuff mentioned above, Fantasia is not to be remembered as nothing more than a historical relic, Fantasia is still a culturally relevant movie with fans spanning many generations. It's not ""Song of the South"". If Disney was to release a remastered and unedited ""Song of the South"" on blu-ray next week, the only people to buy it would be fans of film history, it's not the kind of thing parents are going to give to their kids to watch, in fact, it would be seriously irresponsible of any parent to let their kid watch a movie that reinforces negative racial stereotypes as much as that one does. The same could be said of ""Birth of a Nation"" (though I doubt many kids are interested in that anyway). Fantasia is a movie that kids still love, it's timeless, it's perfect, and it would be a shame to lose it all because of 15 seconds.

What prompted me to write this review was one single review on amazon among all the negative reviews. There was one that stuck out to me, because this guy said that he would have loved to show Fantasia to his daughters, but he didn't want to show them the edited version, so he was boycotting this release. Think about that, this guy was basically saying 'I won't show this movie to my children unless it includes offensive racist material!' That's stupid. This is my point, Fantasia is a movie for children, and to include that 15 seconds of racism and market it to children would be a bad idea, even if they got Whoopi Goldberg to give an introduction to the film and forgive the racism (as many reviewers here have suggested they do) the point would still be lost on the kids, all they would see is an ugly black centaur acting as a servant to the others. Fantasia is a movie of a different time, we accept that either way, but there's two ways to deal with that, either we could preserve the racism and let Fantasia become nothing more than a relic that needs to be justified by Whoopi Goldberg before every viewing, or we can lose 15 seconds and let Fantasia remain relevant and thrive throughout the ages as a gorgeous and unspoiled piece of art.

This is one hell of a blu-ray, I can't think of any movie that can show off the technical splendor of blu-ray more than this one, the perfect combination of stunning visuals and magnificent music. I recommend this product to everyone, with a reminder that the missing 15 seconds does not diminish the enjoyment of this classic one bit.",1291075200,"1,924",5945,4.535880708294501

First of all it only has the more recent cut of the first Fantasia that most of us are familiar with. Alot of it's scenes were left on the cutting room floor and it was reduced to a mere ninety minutes (1 1/2 hours) as opposed to the original uncut version which was 125 minutes (two hours, counting the fifteen minute intermission). That's right, half an hours worth of footage, gone. If you want the first movie on DVD, go for the Special 60th Anniversary Edition instead. It has the complete uncut version with the entire narration by Deems Taylor and the intermission and is fully restored in THX for awsome picture and sound. And why anyone would want Fantasia 2000 is beyond me. It's okay but it doesn't do the first movie justice. Just a friendly warning, don't go for this one, it's not really worth it. (Update - 12/26/10) Okay, first of all I shouldn't have said ""piece of garbage"", that was kind of harsh. As it turns out, the full two our version is intact here' although the intermission is missing from both releases. That's okay though, staring at a closed curtain and a Fantasia logo card would probably have made for a boring fifteen minutes anyway. I'm still not to crazy about Fantasia 2000 though but for those who insist on having both, this would be th set for them. Although the 60th Anniversary release has better bonus features.

Because of this fact when the film was put back into circulation in the 1960's at the height of the civil rights movement a good 5 seconds involving a half-donkey half-black servant centaur was panned and scanned out in order to not strain race relations further. It has never been re-inserted because it effects the movie so little. As well, as someone who has seen the clip - it truly is a poor joke made in bad taste, there's a reason they don't make Golliwogs anymore. For a film critic this is horrible because it means you aren't seeing every single second - for a parent purchasing this film today it doesn't matter. Fantasia continues to be a wonderful way to introduce children to orchestral music and remains fun all these many years after the fact. To adults it remains a fun and interesting movie with beautiful artwork and powerful performances. The only negative about this collection is their attempt to push Blu-Ray on everyone - as this is one of the few copies I can still readily find of the film.

The movie, in it's entirety has not been seen since the first year of release, but obviously is available somewhere for it to even have a bad copy on YouTube. This would have been the perfect time to step aside and show possibly both versions for those film lovers, who are not easily offended by what was common in the 40s.

As for those people who have commented about the narration track being different, you must not have read anything on this movie as you would know that it is impossible due to the audio track being unusable. Achieving and preserving was something that was not as important as it is now. There was too much lost quality on the actual tracks to be able to use and/or recreate.

I boycott this version and hope others will follow suit.
I've had the priviledge of watching both versions and the original full-length uncensored version is MAGNIFICENT!

Censoring classics, whether print, audio or video, for ""objectionable"" content is the gravest insult to history, art and the society that appreciates art and how it reflects our history.

If one is offended, one has every right, and if a wish to not be further offended, even an obligation to ""turn away"" from the offending material.  NOT the right to censor and by doing so, maliciously diminish a classic due to an irrational fear of offending the presently prudish, overly-sensitive and tyrannical elements in a society.

Even if ""apalling"" stereotypes are present, it should be imperative that they NOT be censored. The true version of this movie can even be used as a teaching tool!  Used to teach the younger generations how common society once viewed some segments of humanity and how we are capable of changing for the better.  Attempting to ignore past mistakes and crimes of conscience by ""re-writing"" our history through censorship, and eliminating evidence of our prejudices is a crime against society and perpetuates bigotry by ignoring the lessons learned when those amongst us progressed beyond the petty, harmful viewpoints evident in much of our heritage.

The lesson is that we CAN change for the better and our art is not diminished by this content but to the contrary, further elevated by the newly-discovered lessons contained in it.

I am offended, thus I turn away from this inexcusable destruction of a beautiful movie.
Actions such as these encourage piracy.  I love this film and plan to enjoy it again in the future. But this type of insidious censorship urges me to ""vote with my dollars"" and no longer support those who approve of it.  Ergo it encourages me to obtain and view a classic by means other than those which support the censors.

My hope is that the ""powers that be"" at Disney (and everywhere in a perfect world! :-) will use their influence to educate through strong, rational leadership instead of bowing to petty, ignorant foolish folk in dire need of enlightenment, who so often are seemingly destined to repeat the historically obvious mistake of censoring art.

Deems Taylor's quaint but original narration should have come back after the last DVD release (remember when they decided to eliminate Stokowski's soundtrack to tack on a new stereo track?).

The depiction of the centaurs is completely inappropriate for a 2010 release.  A lot of reviewers are calling them the ""black centaurs"" when they would be more accurately described as the ""coon centaurs"" because they presented a negative and inaccurate stereotypical version of Blacks (albeit as mythical creatures).  There is no ""historical"" value to the depiction when it wasn't historically accurate to begin with.

And it isn't a benign relic when the movie is introduced to a new generation.  Maybe the generation that grew up with the racist version wants their memories untouched (although you may want to ask yourself why) but the point of any Disney release is for KIDS to see them.  I would love for some of the anti-censorship crowd to come over to my house and explain to my 3 year old daughter why the centaur whose skin color is like hers has oversized lips, a buck toothed grin and shines the hooves of the white centaurs before they go out and leave her behind.  I would really like to see you face that inquisition.  As for me, I would never subject my child to that insult for the sake of preserving a deeply painful ""history"" when the point of Fantasia is to share with her some beautiful animation and music.

This is probably my all-time favorite Disney movie, which I have been watching for as long as I can remember, and for it to finally get a Blu-Ray release is something of a dream come true.  Fantasia 2000, although it pails in comparison to the original, still holds up as one of the very few good Disney sequels.

Now, I am giving this release four stars out of five for one reason (and it's not about the censorship, but I'll get to that in a minute): they really dropped the ball on the bonus features.  While you still get what looks like some pretty cool bonus material, such as The Schultheis Notebook and Disney and Dali: A Date With Destino Documentary (though, I'm not too sure how much this really has to do with Fantasia), there is a treasure trove of features out there that are not included in this release, which really makes this release feel like a missed opportunity. Back in 2000, Disney released a triple-disc set,  that contained Fantasia, Fantasia 2000, and a bonus disc entitled Fantasia Legacy.  The set contained full-length ""Making of"" documentaries for each film, multiple commentaries, test footage, deleted scenes, and a plethora of other fascinating featurettes documenting Disney's ultimate creation.  All of this is gone on the Blu-Ray, replaced by exclusive material that doesn't provide much insight into the history of this great film.

UPDATE: If you have an online-enabled Blu-ray player or wifi-connected PS3, you can access all of the Anthology features through BD-Live, so there is no need to invest in the other set!

Now, as for the censoring, people are making a big deal out of nothing.  Honestly, you loose a whopping 19 seconds of film, cutting out an African American centaur that feels rather out of place anyway.  Seriously, the entire sequence is a depiction of Greek mythology, where pretty much everyone is white, or a slight variation thereof, so an African American centaur wouldn't really fit into this.  If I were to edit this, I would probably do the exact same thing, because the black centaur just isn't necessary.  Besides, this is the cut I have grown up with and is the cut that has been used for over 40 years, so I do not know why it is so appalling to some that they would release this.  A little research will show that Fantasia has undergone numerous cuts and re-edits/re-recordings over the years and that this is the most complete and closest to the original source material that we are ever going to get.

In my opinion, if you love Disney movies, this release is essential, especially if you want to see the amazing visuals that these films have to offer on glorious High Definition.

Like any masterpiece, the public deserves to view a masterpiece un-tampered with. In the case of Fantasia, we should be able to see this film un-edited. I completely understand the people at Disney wanting to portray themselves as ""Family Friendly"" and P.C. The Walt Disney studio has always been known for it's clean, wholesome entertainment. What has been sacrificed? Sprinkled throughout the Pastoral sequence is a Black Centaurette that is a servant/ comedy foil to the other Centaurettes. She is an un-fortunate stereotype. But this type of stereotype appeared in many cartoons and movies of the period. We had Irish Policeman, Jewish Butchers selling their wares, Chinese launderers etc. It was common at the time. To remove the Centaur is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. Are we as viewers not given enough credit to hold these images in a historical perspective? Apparently not. The hierarchy at Disney, has made that decision for us. Sorry people, We at Disney Home Video simply won't allow you to view Fantasia in it's original form. She isn't even on screen for an extended amount of time. Place the footage in the supplementary at the very least. Hire Leonard Maltin or Whoopi Goldberg to tell us that it's o.k. to watch this footage, as long as we are told it was of the period. If that makes them happy. I found it amazing the extent that the studio has gone to remove this footage. If you watch the scene in the Pastoral where Bacchus is being led up to his wooden throne, you will see a red carpet unfurl before him. Seemingly the carpet is un-rolling itself! Wrong, the now missing Centarette unrolled it before him originally! Now digitally removed along with all of her other footage. Even If one accepts this, the powers that be have taken out the original narrator's voice! Missing is the original voice of Respected Musical Historian Deems Taylor. The story goes, that they were missing some 30 or so seconds of the vocal soundtrack of Mr. Taylor from a segment. Instead of finding a sound-a-like to dub this small amount of dialogue, they replaced all of Mr. Taylor's vocal tracks with another (Sounds nothing like him) person's voice! Makes one wonder, what the family of Mr. Taylor feels when they see their Father, Grand Father's or Uncles presence, but now with another person's voice!. Something else makes me wonder. Did anyone see the re-release of Fantasia in the 90's? In that version, at the end of the film we see the orchestra pick up their instruments and exit the stage. Was that footage pulled from the Intermission scene, where they exited the stage? If so, put it back. It really added a lot to the ending. Unless of course, Walt Disney wanted the screen to go black after Ava Maria. Then of course, don't touch it.

Fantasia is a part of film history, and as such, needs to be seen as it was meant to be seen in it's entirety.

As has been said here in the comments section, all Disney would need to do is to add a disclaimer at the beginning (like Whoopi Goldberg has done with the Warner cartoon sets) stating this is a product of it's time and as such Disney is releasing it uncut.

4241343,1,B0040QTNSU,"Disney needs to provide 2 versions of this film: one for the ""politically correct"" (although I've had yet to hear from anyone that the original actually ""offended"") crowd, and the other for the sensible among us who want the full artistic vision in all its glory. Releases with stupid editing is like taking Vivaldi's ""the Four Seasons"" and omitting ""Spring"" because it alludes to reproduction and sexuality through song. No one would buy the ""Four Seasons"" with only 3.

Just provide the public the option. That takes it out of your hands, Disney. Do it right, or just don't do it...

4241356,3,B0040QTNSU,"Personally, I found the first DVD release of Fantasia (the original) highly disappointing. The resolution was dark and not very sharp, and the soundtrack simply wasn't the glorious multi-channel affair that accompanied the 70mm restoration release (I can cite specific instances, such as the stunning church bell effect at the conclusion of Night on Bald Mountain, which caused every head in the theater to jerk to the side trying to spot where that ""live"" bell player was stationed! And where's that big crescendo in the low strings *underneath* the bell??). More like the limp 2-channel audio, now artificially spread out, that we've been saddled with since the days of the LP.  The DVD was also released in *5. Zero* Dolby Digital, which means that the bass response - excellent in the theater - didn't stand a chance on home systems simply because it wasn't there.

To be honest, the couple of short ""censored"" scenes bothered me only because they were, in fact, censored. Nothing I can spot has been cut from Fantasia's playing time - the few shots that have been deemed offensive have simply been re-framed; in other words, blown up and cropped. The result is a few seconds of a grainier picture than the rest and something less than stellar screen composition. And, as has been said elsewhere, these edits were done quite some time ago.  Honestly, far worse ""hatchet jobs"" have been perpetrated on films we now regard as unimpeachable classics, say, King Kong and Metropolis. Even 2001 lost about 20 minutes of its playing time after its New York opening.

I'm still curious what this new Blu-Ray release of the original Fantasia has to offer in the A/V department. No such questions or worries over F-2000 - I saw that at IMAX and it knocked my socks off! I'm confident the Blu-Ray video will be stunning, but the audio?? Any comments?  I'll keep looking through previous reviews here as well.",1284681600,12,1901,4.854938271604938
4241357,5,B0040QTNSU,"A review of the actual product: (see next section if you are confused)

My original review was written solely on the technical aspects of the release;  having now owned and watched the Blu-Ray, it has reaffirmed my opinion that you should not miss this multi-disc set if you are at all considering it.  This is an excellent film (Fantasia) comparable to any contemporary production with the sole exception of form factor (not widescreen, as with today's films0.  Looking with a fresh, objective view, even the painted (vs CGI) images could be considered a stylistic choice . . . which makes this a superb film that really transcends time . . . perhaps it will have to wait for it's 100th anniversary to become clear.  The Blu-Ray transfer is absolutely wonderful; it could honestly pass as a modern film done in homage to this type of picture.  Like most people, I just sort of watched Fantasia as an adolescent and said ""that's sort of nice"".  Understanding music much better, as an adult, and photography on a semi-pro level, I have to say that this release of Fantasia really makes it clear that Walt Disney and the other producers truly understood what they were undertaking at the time.  I mentioned, at the start of this review, that you should purchase this if you are at all considering it; based on the numbers, when these films 'go back into the vault', the price goes way up, so just buy it now if you were considering it, and wait a year or two if you don't like it . . . possibly make a profit.  Rent it if you insist on being safe.

A review of the reviews (original review -- this should clear up the confusion)
This product got the CRAP kicked out of it, even before released.  If you really look into it, the 'censorship cuts' that everyone talks about is ONE instance (""Sunflower"" is the character they are referring to - search the web if you're interested) and is most likely not in the version that anyone saw as the edit was made in 1969.  I can't agree with the number of people that basically say ""don't see this, it's not original"" -- the story wasn't changed as were done in other ""self-censorship"" titles (I'm looking at you Luke S.).

The alternative would be to rate it as TV-MA or NC-17, as this type of thing is inappropriate without the understanding of the time it was made, and/or include the mandatory 'sit down and talk' with Whoopi Goldberg (See Golden Collection) -- being that the edit was done 40 years ago, it would be an 'edit' to put it back in there.

Moving along, it's nice to see that this isn't a double-dip.  You get Blu-Ray & DVD on both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 . . . titles that (in my opinion) never really warranted the cost of a single Disney title.

In the replies you will see that there are 'director's cut' type omissions as well.

One Last commentary (if you got this far, your mind is more open than most):
You've got two types of reviewers here; the crusaders that want that black <type of character> waiting on the white <type of character> -- either because your'e a racist (that's a guess, why else would you be so concerned) or a prideful purist . . . or you have someone that wrote a much better review.  You will see that the latter got VERY high reviews, excepting where the crusaders voted them down . . . buy this product, it's excellent.",1284595200,26,3311,4.471760797342193

And I've actually seen Song of the South. I have no idea how anybody could honestly think the film is racist. The Uncle Remus character is more like a father figure and role model to the young kids in the movie.",1284508800,82,428,4.283950617283951

4241360,1,B0040QTNSU,"Don't get me wrong Fantasia and to a lesser extent Fantasia 2000 are both great films and deserve 4-5 stars. This review is about the material actually included on the set.

Disney's marketing department is up on their high horse again with respect to being too politically correct.

As quoted from ""The Digital Bits"" web site - ""...the original theatrical version of the film featured a 'black centaurette' character in The Pastoral Symphony sequence. For the previous DVD release, this character was removed via a digital zoom. Our sources tell us that this change is still part of the new Blu-ray, but that with improved digital tools the edit is more seamless.""

Shame on you Disney. Sticking your head in the sand again because you're afraid of a little controversy.

Enough is enough. Don't buy this or any other censored product from Disney. Tell them to stop this practice by hitting them where it counts, the bottom line. Disney, you should either not release a product at all (think the travesty of Disney not releasing ""Song of the South"") or do release it in it's native format and include and explanation of the climate in which the original material was released.

Disney, pull your head out of the sand and stop being afraid of what people might say.",1284508800,139,1265,4.784403669724771
4241361,2,B0040QTNSU,"As a big fan of ""Fantasia,"" I was disappointed when the regular DVD box set came out, because Disney Home Video decided to restore two minutes of footage (that Walt Disney himself deemed not essential) to the film, most of which featured narrator Deems Taylor. However, they could not find the audio track for this footage, so they had a voice actor re-record ALL of Deems Taylor's introductions. Now, anyone who has seen the film knows that Deems Taylor has a very distinctive voice, and the voice actor they hired tried to imitate it, but it did not have the character of Taylor's delivery.

But worse than that, Disney Home Video also brightened the picture on all the narrator's segments. Remember the theatrical presentations where he was a shadowy, mysterious figure? Where you could just barely get enough detail on his face to get a sense of who he was? All that evocative and poetic feeling of mystery was gone in the regular DVD release, because Taylor's face was brightened considerably to the point where he was just some guy standing there in a tuxedo yakking at you. It took away the classiness of the setup sequences and made them purely dry information pieces.

So incensed was I at this drastic re-working of a classic film that when I ran into Scott McQueen, who was in charge of Disney restorations at that time, I fairly blasted him about it. Scott sympathized with my disappointment, but admitted that the decision to alter the film in this manner was not his, but the Disney Home Video marketing department.

I'm hoping against hope that this Blu-ray release restores the original color timing of the movie, with all it's moody mystery and poetic darkness (and Deems Taylor's real voice), but we'll just have to wait and see.",1284163200,31,1747,4.759075907590759
4241362,5,B0040QTNSU,"After reading all the negative reviews in Amazon, I was inclined not to buy this disc. I could not resist since Fantasia is very dear to me and is very close to my life since I was 6 years old.  Back in Havana, (when Cuba was free from any oppression and destruction) every spring there was a theater that showed it for a few weeks.  The lines were blocks long of people waiting to enter the theater to see Fantasia.  I loved it and my mother took me to see it every year. Some times we watched almost half of the movie standing in the isles of the theater until the seats were free for us.
This restoration is incredible.  Some how the engineers at Disney have managed, not only to restore the image to a new splendor and detail, but the sound also.  Now it sounds like none of the previous releases.  They have restored the original recording to perfection.
I have not watched yet Fantasia 2000 but this movie since is new don't think has much in the restoring department. What they have done with the original Fantasia is close to amazing!

I guess I'm on the fence regarding the changes made to the Deems Taylor material, but the loss of Sunflower is no loss to me.

My biggest complaint with the film is Deems Taylor, who redundantly explains each segment, telling us what to expect, what we can easily see with our own eyes, as though we were blithering idiots.  Removing his annoying remarks would have cut down on the viewing time, considerably.  They were certainly eager enough to edit out the racist bits during the 60s.
And although they tried to make some of the segments cute, this isn't a cartoon for kids.
