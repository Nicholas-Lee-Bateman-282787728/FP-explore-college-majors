1096381,5,6305951446,"The Fly is the movie I want to introduce my nephew to the great world of atomic age horror films. When I was twelve I watched the Late Show with my best buddy Sam Byars' house in my pajamas. The film was really great but we positively freaked at the end. The image of the fly with the human head screaming Help me! HEELP me! never gets out of your head. What is so marvelous about The Fly and other sci fi movies in that era is they weren't played with a knowing tongue in cheek as is the case with so many horror films of the '90s. They give the film star treatment and play it as a serious drama. The Fly is a complex well written movie. We are introduced to the story in the still shocking opening sequence, then we rewind the story to uncover what led to the murder.  Then just when you think the film has unraveled everything, ""The Fly"" rolls forward to the shocking finale. Rather than be just a monster movie, The Fly is a human tragedy about teleportation experiment gone terribly wrong. Its a cautionary tale to warn scientific progress pushed beyond our ability to understand can produce unimaginable terrors. Next its a crime story as we try to unravel the events that lead to a gruesome murder. Lastly it is about a family in a life or death crisis. Mom and dad dealing with a serious crisis while trying to protect their little boy from the terrible truth. The little boy Phillipe's naivety is cleverly  used as an irritation to heighten the tension and add dark humor in a frustrating situation. The stakes are very high in this film and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Personally I am only interested in the original classic and haven't seen Return of the Fly. However the modern David Cronenberg version of the fly is more gorey but also very good. I can scarcely wait one more year to permanently scar my nephew's mind. : )",1001548800,2,1847,4.350724637681159
1096382,4,6305951446,"This DVD combines the classic Horror/Science Fiction film ""The Fly"" with its inferior sequel.  What makes ""The Fly"" a classic is not when we finally see that Andre Delambre (David Hedison) has the head of a fly, but when we see the screaming face of his wife Helen (Patricia Owens) multiplied by the insect's multi-faceted eye.  But even that scene is nothing compared to when Francois Delambre (Vincent Price) and Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall), discover a fly with the head and arm of a human, trapped in a spider's web and screaming ""Help Me!"" over and over again in a high pitched voice of terror.  Francois had been helping Andre with his teleportation experiments, which were going well until Andre used himself as the test subject and never noticed there was a fly in the chamber with him.  David Cronenberg remade this film to show how this would have ""really"" happened, but this is one of those films where most of us willingly suspend our disbelief and go along for the ride.  The story is told in flashback as a distraught Helen, accused of having crushed her husband's head and arm in a press, frantically insists no one in house hurt a fly--especially if it has a white head.  With a script by James Clavell based on the story by George Langelaan (it appeared in Playboy with the artwork of a white page on which there was one small fly), this 1958 film was directed by Kurt Neumann.
""The Return of the Fly"" attempts to duplicate the success of the original by pretty much just repeating the original plot line.  However, instead of achieving horror the end result this time around is completely laughable.  Philippe Delambre (Brett Halsey), the son of the original ""fly"" Andre Delambre, grows to continue his father's teleportation experiments.  Once again Francois Delambre (Price) helps Philippe as he did the boy's father.  And, once again, a Delambre trades his head and an arm with a fly.  Price, whose performance in the original was wonderfully understated, goes back to overacting and when the fly starts running around the countryside it is impossible not to start laughing so hard you are in danger of choking on your popcorn.  Go watch David Cronenberg's remake, where he tells how this story would have ""really"" happened, instead of ""The Return of the Fly.""  Watching this 1959 sequel, directed by Edward L. Bends, will only leave a bad taste in your mouth.",994204800,5,2388,4.795121951219512
1096383,5,6305951446,"This DVD is a good example of 1950s classic science at its best. You get the original THE FLY and its sequel. In 1958's THE FLY man through his science takes experimentation of his environment one step too far. Man's attempts to disrupt nature's harmony leads to destruction and horror to him and his loved ones. This is a well intentioned, poignantly directed and produced film. The horror resulting from Al (David) Hedison's experiments gone awry are devastating and disturbingly represented in the film's images. Once seen, the viewer can never forget them. This is a powerful film even to this day. Vincent Price as Francois and Charles Herbert as the young Philippe are good. However, David Hedison and Patricia Owens' performances are brilliant and elevate this film a notch higher. This CinemaScope print by cinematographer Karl Struss on this DVD is beautiful. The colors are rich and the Stereo Sound is excellent. Paul Sawtell's lush score is eerily touching. On the flip side, 1959's RETURN OF THE FLY is an interesting and imaginative sequel. Brydon Baker's black & white CinemaScope photography gives it a feel of film noir with a twist of science fiction. It looks great on this DVD. Both Vincent Price as Fran'ois and Bret Halsey as the grown Philippe turn in believable performances. This can be attributed to Director Edward Bernds' choice to concentrate on characterization over the science fiction elements, which had also been effectively accomplished in the original. John Sutton as Inspector Charas played by Herbert Marshall in the original turned in an adequate performance. The score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter was very effective to the mood of the piece. RETURN OF THE FLY is an interesting and a somewhat overlooked film. I would recommend both these films. This is a handsome DVD and highly recommended.",980121600,5,1837,5.046052631578948
1096384,5,6305951446,"Two spine tingling horror thrillers from the late 50's starring the American prince of horror, Vincent Price, on one DVD !!
Fans of the original (and less bloody) ""THE FLY"" will be wrapped to see this classic film presented in glorious crystal clear color and dolby digital sound that really gets the hairs up on the back of your neck. For those who don't know the story...scientist Andre Delambre (David Hedison....later to star in ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") develops a matter transfer device. However, on trialling the machine himself, a fly is caught inside, and Hedison emerges with fly's head and arm...and the fly now posesses Hedison's head and arm !! Film boasts plenty of classic shock moments...including the first time we see the fly in full view !! ""Return of the Fly"" isn't quite up to the original, but still has plenty of enjoyable moments that make it a nice companion to the original....and it still has Vincent Price on board !
Interesting anecdote from ""THE FLY""...according to Vincent Price in his book ""I Like what I Know"", in the final sequence of ""THE FLY"" where Price and fellow actor Herbert Marshall are peering into a spiders web containing the fly (with human head and arm)..the two actors could not complete the supposedly sombre scene without bursting into fits of paralysing laughter. The only way they could finish the scene was by ensuring no eye contact was made with each other....otherwise the laughter just continued !!

1096387,5,6305951446,"I vividly recall being creeped out by this film as a child and it left a memorable impression on me. Although I originally saw it in b&w (those were the days before color tv!) and since most of the 50's films in this genre were filmed in b&w, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was indeed a color film. This dvd presentation is quite outstanding - it is presented in its original aspect ratio and the sound has been remastered in a 4.0 Dolby Digital remix and an optional 2.0 surround sound. The sound is fantastic but most impressive is the image quality. It is super sharp and the colors are beautiful. On the other hand (and the other side), ""The Return of the Fly"" looks great also (in b&w) but it is a lousy movie.

The Fly (1958) is a classic horror film, and alone it's easily worth the $10. Return of the Fly is a decent sequel, but not in the same league IMO as the original. The Curse of the Fly is a terrible film. The 4th DVD has all the special features, as the film DVD's have none.

FYI, the first film was in colour and the others were in black & white. Also, the 1980's Fly remakes, while fun to watch, are not as good as these originals IMO... the remakes are weaker on plot, and more about showing off special effects.

1096855,5,6305951446,"How not to lose your head while others around you panic.  The sad tale of a scientist with a swell idea but a work environment given over to flies.  Poor Andre Delambre (David Hedison), he would tamper with things beyond his scope of understanding.  The man wanted to transport things from one box to another.  He wanted to disintegrate matter then reintegrate it over great distances.  First, his transporter ruins an ashtray then it played havoc with the family cat, which failed to reintegrate.  But what the heck, lets go to the ballet!  This was one careless and callous scientist.  But.  He eventually confessed to losing the cat.......somewhere in the great beyond.  But.  He pooh-poohed his wife as being frightened by progress.  Yet, he admitted that he didn't really know how or why his machine worked.  (Im surprised he didn't try it on his son!)  Naturally, the wife is arrested for squishing her husband like a bug......well, part of him at any rate.  If only they had caught that blasted fly with the funny head.
Fabulous horror/sci-fi flick with a great reveal when hubby is unveiled.
Vincent Price is sublime as Andre fly-heads brother...........in love with his sister-in-law!  This film is practically a masterpiece.

Return of the fly is a black and white gem also featuring Vincent Price as Francois Delambre.  This time poor little orphan Philippe (Brett Halsey) is all grown up and determined to fulfill his dads insane project.........even if it kills him.  Hes a ruthless nitwit, surly and ungrateful.  He blackmails his uncle (Price) into helping him or hell ruin the family business!  The rotten little snot hires a larcenous lab partner/part-time murderer to aid him in his plot to rule the world...............or build a machine that turns a British agent into half a guinea pig.  Naturally, junior ends up the same as his dad but in a vain attempt to outdo him, he gets and ever BIGGER fly head.  Will they find the fly in time to save him?  Will they thwart Ronald Holmes aka Alan Hinds evil plan to steal the invention?

1096942,5,6305951446,"Of course, five stars! If you're a horror and sci-fi fan like me, what could be more horrible than swapping your chromosomes on a sub-atomic level with those of a common housefly? David Hedison is great as the starry eyed scientist working towards an end to world hunger and poverty by being able to transport goods and services from one place on the earth to another instantaneously.
Then something goes wrong. A simple mistake. For one moment, he was careless, not realizing a fly was in the transporter pod with him, and the hideous result is a nightmare for him and his family. He becomes a human with the grotesque head of a fly, as well as a claw hand and foot. The makeup effects are superb for the time this movie was made and they still shock today.
As a horror film, it was way ahead of it's time. No body count to speak of for a monster movie, unless of course you count the poor unfortunate scientist himself, both versions of him. I can still hear the tiny whimper...""help meee!""
'The Return of the Fly', which was shot in black and white instead of color for some reason (it was cheaper? I don't know), features the return also of
Vincent Price, who plays Francois Delambre, brother to Andre, the brilliant but alas, unlucky scientist who was transformed into a monster in the first film. Brett Halsey plays the son of Andre, who of course like all scientists in respectable sci-fi movies wants to carry on his father's work.
Vincent's character tries to dissuade him every step of the way, but to no avail. And whadda' ya' know? Similar result, except that there is a body count this time. The fly headed son of Andre Delambre goes out to seek revenge on the double-crossing partner who was trying to steal his work for profit, and the man who would sell it for him to the highest bidder.
The body count was the only reason I liked this movie better than the first when I saw them as a youth...but I'm older now (and I wish that would stop soon) and in retrospect, 'The Fly' is a far superior film as far as pure science fiction goes.( Still like me a monster movie with a high body count
though.)
The third entry, 'Curse of the Fly' didn't thrill me too much the first time I watched it, and probably as most others, I was disappointed at the omission of the fly-headed creature that menaced the first two films. But as a stand-on-it's-own sort of movie (kind of like Halloween Three; Season of the Witch... with no Michael Meyers) it doesn't tower over it's predecessors, but deserves a comfortable little niche at the end of the trilogy. It has some fairly bad laboratory mishaps and teleportations gone wrong, resulting in things that must be hidden from sight in closet-like rooms out back behind heavily latched doors.
All very entertaining movies, and with the addition of a bonus disc featuring interviews, stills, behind the scenes photos and a great bio of the incomparable Vincent Price, one of my favorite horror stars, and I think, would have been an awesome person to have known.",1427155200,,3008,4.561922365988909

It certainly holds its own against the first two, and was maybe even my favourite of the three. Yes, surprise, surprise. It certainly is more diabolical, reminding me somewhat of the ""Island of Dr. Moreau"", as a myriad of people become victims of the scientists' experiments.

All three are in their own case, as is a fourth disc which has the special features, and includes a 44 minute episode (1977) from Biography, featuring Vincent Price.

1097175,5,6305951446,"I may not be the best judge of these movies, because I am biased in their favor.  I first saw The Fly when I was about five years old (in a double feature with The Blob).  They scared me to death!  I loved it, and was hooked for life.  In Arizona, in the 1960's and 1970's, we had a television program (on an independent channel) called World Beyond.  They showed everything from Carnival of Souls to Invasion of the Body Snatchers to Bride of Frankenstein, including The Fly triology, on Friday nights, and a reprise on Saturday morning.  Those were happy times, because my whole family would gather to watch, and get scared!  Later in life, I was thrilled when I had an opportunity to meet Vincent Price (who stars in the first two Fly movies).  I got to talk to him for about half an hour about all the great sci-fi/horror movies he had done.  I guess I'm old-fashioned:  I'd rather watch these old treasures, with their lack of graphic sex and pornographic (sorry Eli Roth) violence.  I want to be thrilled and chilled, not disgusted.  So, if your tastes run this way, give them a try.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",1395100800,3,1129,4.3701923076923075

There was little in genetic research so the film-makers filled in fact with interpretation.  The result is a classic of science fiction-horror.  the special effects are first-rate for their time and the acting is first-rate.  Vincent Price adds a delicious tenderness as the brother of the doomed scientist.  The sequel, Return of the Fly is in B & W (a mystery to me as to why it was filmed in B & W.) a pale version of the original with the son of the doomed scientist following in his father's footstep.  Of course, there is a slimy assistant and another giant fly.  The final film, The Curse of the Fly features no fly but there are several grotesque creatures and the family curse.

1097291,4,6305951446,"The Fly(released Aug/58) and the Return of the Fly(released July/59)both come to light on this two sided disc from Fox. The original Fly is a classic. This is one Sci-Fi classic that simply got away from me,and I had never ever seen the film other than on a full framed B&W TV set,until just the other day! They present the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and in colour! It doesn't sound like alot,but when you see it for the first time in colour and in such good condition as presented here,it is quite a revelation. The Return of the Fly is in the same w/s a/r and is in B&W,but it is still a great print.
The story of The Fly is well known. The setting is in Montreal(I did not know that until I recently re-watched it)and it concerns a company run by two brothers played by Vincent Price and David Hedison(future star of TV's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea).It seems Vincent's brother is somewhat of a techno wiz and he has been dabbling in trying to disintegrate and re-integrate matter. The story itself starts out after the main circumstances and tragedy has happened. When the back story comes around we find that Hedison started carefully using inanimate objects then progressed slowly to living matter. When the kinks are worked out he puts himself in the chamber,but unfortunately a fly entered also. He re-integrates with a head and left arm like a fly. He and his wife try in vain to capture the fly who got its molecules mixed up with his,but time runs out and Hedison finally,with the help of his wife,commits suicide. The end of the film has the terrifying moment where the recalcitrant fly with Hedison's head and arm,is stuck on a spider web pleading for help. A police inspector finishes off the gruesome moment with a well flung rock to both creatures.
The Fly to this day STILL packs a tremendous punch,in moments such as when we first see Hedison with the Fly head,to his demise later. This is a classic of its kind and I give it 4 1/2-5 stars.
The Return of the Fly is good,but not up to the level of its predecessor. The story finds us back in Montreal and Vincent is burying his sister in law,years after the first incident occurred. He has raised his nephew best he can and now that his nephew is old enough he wants to know the exact causes of his fathers death. Vincent takes him to the old company lab where it all began and relates the story. Instead of settling on this,the nephew wants to follow in his fathers footsteps. Vincent at first refuses to help,but eventually comes around. Mixed into this is an ex assistant of Vincent's that is a crook,who is working with the nephew now,and wants to steal the plans for the machines and make a buck. The nephew makes impressive headway but when he discovers what his assistant is up to a fight breaks out. The nephew is knocked unconscious and is thrown into an integration chamber. He also deliberately throws a fly into it. When he re-integrates he has been hideously transformed into a mutant like his father. He seeks out the crook and his assistant and kills them both. When he finally returns they are able to locate the fly that was in the chamber with him and they successfully bring the nephew back to normal.
TROF just doesn't pack the same punch as the first,as we have already seen the results before,not to mention this film relies more on scare for scare sake(more typical of the 50s type films).It also has a quickie and unsatisfying ending. I would give it a 3 1/2 star rating. There was another sequel,The Curse of the Fly in /65,but it was not a good film at all,and didn't have any of the same folks in it from the original two.
All in all a great pairing of the original Fly movies with Vincent Price. The first is the best of the two. The DVD itself is on a dreaded double-sided disc,so watch out for possible scratching and scuffing. Recommended.",1383004800,,3857,4.472340425531915

1097445,5,6305951446,"The Fly Collection is a four DVD collection of The Fly, Return of The Fly, The Curse of The Fly, and The Fly Collection Disc of Horrors. Only The Curse of The Fly is the only one I did not write a review for because the movie made no sense and there is no fly in the movie. Mainly a third and fourth generation of the Delembre is continuing Andre Delambre work. The movie does not follow continuity because Henri Delembre is presented as the son of Andre Delambre and Martin and Albert Delembre are the grandsons of Andre Delambre and Philippe DeLambre is not even mention in the movie. Also Inspector Charas is dead in the Return of The Fly and seems to have risen from the dead in The Curse of The Fly. Finally when Inspector Charas shows pictures of Andre Delambre as the Fly to Inspector Ronet, it is pictures of the Fly from the Return of the Fly.  Now with the commentary with David Hedison and Film Historian David Del Valle is okay at best, but could have been better. Finally in disc four of The Fly Collection Disc of Horrors is okay. The Vincent Price Biography and Flytrap: Catching a Classic are a nice touch but it does not due justice to the collection. The Fly Collection is great if you want to own all three Fly movies. This set gets an AAA+++.

Disc 1 - The Fly

The Fly starring Vincent Price, is one hour and thirty - three minutes long and was released on August 29, 1958. The story takes place in Montreal, Quebec; which explains why the reason for the French accents. The film starts at the end when Helene Delembre has just taken part in killing her husband. Helene calls Francois Delambre (her brother-in-law) and Francois calls Police Inspector Charas. We find out in the film that Helene's husband, Andre Delambre, has made a machine that can transport atom through the air and to another place. When Andre runs a second tests on himself again, a fly gets caught in the machine with him and Andre has the left arm and head of a fly. After a few days of this new body, he finds himself losing his sanity and orders Helene to kill him. At the end of the movie when they begin to take Helene away, Philippe Delambre (her son) tell Uncle Francois that he has found the funny looking fly. Francois tells Inspector Charas about it. Philippe shows them both where the fly is and in the end Inspector Charas kills it with a rock. In the movie the monster fly is only shown for about ten minutes; though the left hand is shown earlier. So the horror does not come till the end of the story. Unlike most monster movies, The Fly seems to have a heart. The Fly does not go on any killing spree nor does The Fly kidnaps anyone. So at the end of the movie, one has to feel sad for The Fly. I give this movie an AAA+++.

Disc 2 - The Return of the Fly

The Return of the Fly is one hour and eighteen minutes long and was released July 1959. This film was shot in black and white to save on costs. Also with this Fly, his head is bigger and his left arm and right leg are part of a fly. In the original only the head and left arm are parts of the fly. With the fly only the head of the human is showing; the right leg and left arm are missing. The story is set fifteen years in the future. The movie starts off with the funeral of Helene DeLambre. Her son Philippe DeLambre and his Uncle Franois DeLambre are at the funeral. On the way home Philippe pressure his Uncle Franois to tell him the truth about the death of his father. Franois takes Philippe to his father's laboratory and tells Philippe the whole story. Philippe wants to continue in his father work. Francois is against it. Philippe and his friend Alan Hinds construct a new lab in the basement of Philippe's grandfather home. Alan decides to sell the plans to the black market. Philippe corners Alan in the lab. A fight takes place and Philippe is knocked out and is put into the machine with a fly. When he re-emerges, he has the head, left arm and right leg of a fly. In the end he is returned to normal. Vincent Price is the only one from the original movie to reprise his role. I give this movie an A.

1097446,4,6305951446,"The three disc DVD set of The Fly, The Return of the Fly, and The Curse of the Fly is typical of late fifties - early sixties horror films.

1097450,4,6305951446,"This set contains four discs, each in their own slim case and packaged together in a bright colored cardboard ""collection"" box.  Each of the movies have an accompanying one-page insert that lists the disc chapters on one side and a kind of neat mini-poster reproduction of the movie's theater poster on the other.

The fourth disc in the set called ""Disc of Horrors"" contains a 1997 A&E Network Vincent Price biography, which I enjoyed watching quite a bit.  It also contains a featurette, some still galleries, press books, posters and other odds and ends.  These extras aren't overwhelming and the quality of each varies, but they are nice to have for fans of the Fly movies.

My Amazon star rating is for the DVD set.  My rating and review of each movie follows:

The Fly (1958) - 4.5 out of 5 stars
""The Fly"" is a lot of fun with plenty of creeps, shocks and even a bit of gore.  Right from the start, ""The Fly"" shows us a rather gory scene of a man who's head has been crushed by his wife using an industrial press.  You don't normally see gore like this in any 50's sci-fi feature, so this brings an initial shock.  The story then settles in to recall the story of the characters leading up to the murder.  We find out that the husband/scientist had invented a transportation machine that can beam things Star-Trek style from one cabinet to another.  I don't think the story of ""The Fly"" is a mystery to any self-respecting sci-fi fan so let's just say the scientist tries to transport himself and well, that's where the fun begins.  The behavior of wife Helene is curious.  She loves her husband so much that she goes to great lengths to help him.  The story centers on her and that's a good thing because Patricia Owens shines as wife Helene.  I really don't want to spoil what I think are some neat surprises but I have to say that the reveal of the scientist's transformation to Helene is a great moment.  Even greater are his final moments of rage when he fights his crazed impulses until he ends up destroying his lab.  Very late in the movie there is a scene that is very creepy and is one of my favorite sci-fi/horror moments of all time.  It looks so weird and is such a shock...let's just say, when you hear ""Help Me! Help Me!"", you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.  It scared the Hell out of me as a kid and still gives me shivers today.  The only drawback of ""The Fly"" is that about 50 minutes crawl by before we get to the terrifying fallout of the scientist's experiments.

The Return of the Fly (1959) - 2.5 out of 5 stars
The sequel to 1958's ""The Fly"", Vincent Price returns to work out the kinks in his brother's teleportation project.  Actually, Price's character is reluctant to do so but is nicely coerced into helping out by his nephew Philippe.  This movie is entertaining but it's nothing special.  Even though the original was a color film, this one is in black and white, which actually helps with the creepy possibilities.  Unfortunately, the special effects really make it tough to take this as anything other than a B-movie.  Take the redesigned fly head.  It sure looks cool, but it's so huge that the stuntman wearing it has to hold it on in a couple of scenes.  He also bangs into a hanging light which is unintentionally funny.  The human-headed fly is unconvincing too, but not as bad as the first transporter mishap, a guinea pig with human hands.  The effect is so bad and out of proportion, just wait until you see it being crushed.  I recommend freeze frame.  Hilarious!  What I can't figure out is why the Delambre family just doesn't use their invention to transport non-living items like, say, packages?  FedEx would have nothing on them.

The Curse of the Fly (1965) - 3.5 out of 5 stars
This follow up to 1959's ""The Return of the Fly"" seems barely related to the first two movies of the series.  There's no new fly-related action in it at all and there's no Vincent Price.  But there is the Delambre family and this time they're busy teleporting back and forth between Quebec and London to stay one step ahead of the authorities.  There are some cool directorial touches.  The scene that plays during the opening credits is in slow motion and it's again in glorious black and white.  It features Carole Gray escaping from a mental institution in nothing but a bra and panties.  The laboratory set and transporters are classic sci-fi inventions.  There is also an amazing shot when Martin enters a ""cage"" to find a deformed man leaping toward him.  The look of this shot is really freaky.  Also shocking is the transportation of two men...at the same time.  The result of the reintegration is actually fairly gory.  The ending seems a bit rushed but it is not the typical happy Hollywood ending normally encountered in movies from this time period.  ""The Curse of the Fly"" is a pretty entertaining and stylish finish to the overall satisfying ""Fly"" trilogy.",1320192000,2,4913,4.548460661345496
1097451,5,6305951446,"You have to love this melodramatic nonsense, it's so beautifully done by the Master of Camp Horror. Well, I do, anyway. I could probably shoot a complete remake of this film without recourse to either script or any other paperwork, it's all so vividly imprinted on my mind. David Hedison has always seemed to me a soulless actor so he comes across well as the obsessive young scientist. Our Vincent, on the other hand, simply oozes ham and, as always to me, he does con'vince', ho ho. This movie is great escapist fun and makes a great film because of that.",1317513600,2,557,4.524752475247524
1097452,5,6305951446,"Ok, I'll admit up front that I'm a 50s scifi freak anyway but this is just GREAT!.  The quality of the DVD reproductions are wonderfully produced. I'm not even going to comment on the films themselves.  I love them. You may not.  However, the A&E bio on Vincent Price on the 4th disk, the ""Disk of Horrors,"" is worth the price of the package.  It would run over $20 if you could find it.  I received this set as a gift from my wife, bless her heart.  She always buys me the neatest stuff.  This one is definitely a keeper.",1293408000,2,522,4.16
1097453,5,6305951446,"The Fly:
--------------------
""Help me! Help meeee!"" 1958 saw the release of one of Horror's most memorable movie monsters: THE FLY! The police are investigating the murder of a brilliant researcher when they learn that it was his wife, in fact, that killed him. She tells the tale of daring new science experiment that had gone horribly wrong, where her husband was mistakenly crossed with a fly during an attempt at human teleportation. THE FLY leaps far ahead of its B-movie brethren due to Kurt Neumann's superb handling of the material, taking a silly plot and transforming it into a conceivable human tragedy. David Hedison is brilliant in the role of the mad doctor; a charming husband on the one hand, but an obsessive scientist with an undying lust for knowledge on the other. It is Patricia Owens that is left to carry the film after the accident, and she does so with a striking performance that is filled with loving devotion for her poor unfortunate husband. The greatest shock comes when Hedison steps out of the transporter after attempting to reverse the effects of the transmutation, revealing for the first time his hideously deformed appearance. Neumann also introduces a unique kaleidoscopic lensing for the first-person perspective of The Fly in the thrilling climax. THE FLY is a distinguished classic that is essential viewing for all Sci-Fi and Horror enthusiasts!

Return of the Fly:
--------------------
With his mother fresh in her grave after losing her sanity, the young Philippe Delambre resumes his father's research in an attempt to succeed where his father had failed in the transmission of living matter through time and space. Tragedy strikes twice, however, as Philippe suffers the same damnable fate as his father in becoming a half-human freak! RETURN OF THE FLY follows many of the same familiar steps as the original, but lacks the emotional strength shared between the two leads from before. The great Vincent Price plays a much larger role in this second film, serving as a friend and mentor to his stubborn nephew. What is most unique in this feature is Philippe's growing paranoia of the pesky flies that seem to trail his every move, a bit of foreshadowing that leads towards an all-too-expected end. A subplot involving industrial espionage also adds a touch of Film Noir to the scientific backdrop. Philippe's monstrous alter-ego does not make an appearance until late in the picture, but while the creature's design is quite impressive, its bulbous head does seem rather silly. RETURN's greatest casualties then becomes its conflicting plotting and sluggish pace, which hold it back from becoming more successful. Still, RETURN OF THE FLY provides ample shocks in its final scenes to please the fans that eagerly awaited a sequel.

However,1958 The Fly is an under-rated masterpiece that was worthy of imitation. Vincent Price and David Hedison could not have foreseen the fun they would offer viewers time and again. The Return of the Fly is worth it to see how they rework a script for even more popcorn entertainment.",1260662400,,594,4.265486725663717
1097564,4,6305951446,"Alfred Hitchcock did not direct 'The Fly', but it has the look and feel of a Hitchcock masterpiece.

The film has its dark side: there is the macabre foundry machine, the haunting sounds of the disembodied, the suspense provided by the black cloth, and the spellbinding approach of a hungry orifice.  On the light side: there is the devotion of a brother, the mutual love of husband and wife, and their joy over their son.

The husband is on the cusp of perfecting a revolutionary invention, but he impatiently tries out the machine before doing exhaustive testing.  His wife first learns about the mishap, when she finds his note on the lab door.  She is filled with dread, but she courageously follows his written instructions.  With each new horrific revelation she realizes that their idyllic life is doomed to memories; if only she could find the fly.

The film has a below-the-radar Hitchcock-like moment.  A murder has been committed.  The wife confesses, but the way she confesses leads the police inspector to conclude that she has gone quiet mad.  For the time being, she is confined to her bed.  A nurse brings the wife's lunch on a tray.  Take a look at what she picks up from the tray and you will see the point!

The most memorable scene is one of the last; it is a tingling mixture of humor and horror.

1097566,5,6305951446,"I bought this set because I saw ""The Fly"" when I was a kid of 10 or 11 and it made quite an impression on me. My friend and I would sometimes have a sleepover and stay up to watch ""The Late Late Show"". This was back in 1975 or 76 and TV was black and white then.

I think others have covered the films themselves pretty well, but I want to comment on the packaging which I think is very good. I normally don't get too excited about packaging but I think this is so well done it adds to the overall quality of the set. There are three films plus the bonus materials and each is on its own picture disc and comes in its own slim-case. Each DVD except the bonus comes with a little insert in the form of a reproduction of an original production poster which on the back lists the chapters in each film. The bonus disc contains some very interesting material - the biography of Vincent Price is excellent and there are about 15 previews of other films of the same type which I have already started to hunt down. Also included is a little booklet which contains more fun facts. Everything has a touch of quality to it - nothing feels cheap - and I think any ""Fly"" fan would be proud to own this set. I have downloaded images of all these items so please take a look at them.

I must say having never seen ""The Return of the Fly"" it was great to finally do so even if the movie itself in my opinion isn't that great. The same applies for ""The Curse of the Fly"" which I think started with so much promise but fizzled out somewhat. Context is always important and I think if I has seen these as a child they would have seemed scarier. I rate ""The Fly"" 9/10, ""Return"" 6/10, and ""Curse"" 7/10.

By the way if you don't know who Dandelo is you really must watch ""The Fly"". Poor Dandelo. I wonder where he is now?

1097673,5,6305951446,"This is a great set as is each film in it.  The Fly is the all around best film of the set but it doesn't win that easily.  Return of the fly changed the look by filming in black and white to give it a more artier feel which Price strongly disagreed with (I do as well)among other things during filming.  Return is the funniest/campiest of the bunch.  For example once I saw the guinea pig with little human hands the film had me.  I also believe Return is the most suspenseful of the set.  The Curse of the Fly is better than just ok as I've read from other reviewers and is the second best of the bunch in my opinion.  Curse is also the most artsy picture, here there is no human fly, literally at least.

THE FLY:  5/5 (Overall Best)
I learned in the ten page book that comes with this set that The Fly first appeared in Playboy Magazine in 1957, winning the magazines best story of the year.  A former soldier for Britain's Intelligence Army during World War II, George Lagelaan, wrote the Novella and actually underwent surgery while enlisted to change his identity, thought that was interesting considering the material.
A more subdued Price not yet a permanent horror staple delivers as usual as Francois Delambre, whose brother Andre Delambre has developed a way to transport matter.  Most know the story, eventually Andre tries to teleport himself and a common housefly gets trapped in one of the machines, the result is a cross between a Fly and a human.  The fly mask isn't the over the top part you think it will be prior to seeing this, that comes later, but I felt the simple towel used to hide Andre's head head was subtle and effective.
The Fly coming after WWII and creation of the atom bomb people had a fear of what radiation and it's effects could do.  I felt The Fly's message was not to mess with nature.  The ending wasn't happy but had a happy feel to it that I didn't feel fit, HOWEVER it made it all the more unsettling.

RETURN OF THE FLY: 4.5/5 (Most Suspenseful)
Filmed in black and white return as I said above is the most suspenseful and over the top, at times.  Following his mother's funeral Phillippe Delambre, Andre's son wants to pursue his father's work all his family has suffered hasn't been in vein.  He asks his uncle Francois (Price)for help (Price) which he eventually, reluctantly does.  The plot is plausible, I remember thinking how is the exact same thing going to happen again, but the story is done well so that it makes sense.

THE CURSE OF THE FLY:  5/5 (Most Artistic)
Completely underrated.  Curse begins with the smashing out of a window followed by a young attractive woman escaping from something only to stumble into a member of the Delambre clan and he helps her.  They soon marry without knowing one another and he takes her back to his house/lab.  The Delambres are still at work on their families invention and can actually teleport humans.  There is no fly in this film literally but the young girl above is trapped in this house metaphorically like one.  The film is all serious this time with no campy moments, just a feeling of dread.  Great special effects and make up in this one which comes the closest to Cronenberg's version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly-Blu-ray/dp/B000MNOXZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly [Blu-ray</a>] as far as an attempt to shock the viewer.

1097674,4,6305951446,"Mad scientists, pretty girls and killer insects abound in this great value box set which comprises the original ""Fly"" trilogy, plus a fourth disc loaded with bonus materials!

THE FLY was based on a well-received story written by George Langelaan for Playboy Magazine, and was brought to the screen by Twentieth Century Fox in 1958.  Lushly filmed in CinemaScope and Deluxe Colour, it provided audiences with a far more sleek and stylish horror movie than they would be used to seeing.  It's topline stars Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall, two of the leading character actors of their generation, added another layer of prestige to the production.

The story is told in flashback.  The beautiful Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens) is charged with the gruesome murder of her husband Andre (David 'Al' Hedison) after his crushed body is discovered in the Delambre factory.  Helene insists that Andre told her to kill him, following an experiment that went disastrously wrong, involving the cross-fire of atoms belonging to Andre and a common house-fly.  Andre's brother Francois (Vincent Price) and Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall) remain unconvinced--until a fly with Andre's head is seen trapped in a spiderweb...  Co-starring Kathleen Freeman and little Charles Herbert (""Houseboat"", ""13 Ghosts""), THE FLY is still one of the most unsettling and intense horror movies from the 1950s.  The disc also includes a bonus audio commentary track with the 'Fly' himself, David Hedison.

In THE RETURN OF THE FLY, filmed the following year, we get a good sense of continuity with Vincent Price reprising his role of Francois Delambre.  The story opens several years after the events of ""The Fly"".  Following the death of Helene, Andre's now-grown son Philippe (Brett Halsey) is determined to continue his father's work, much to the horror of Francois.  But Philippe's honest and honourable intentions are destroyed by his devious assistant (David Frankham) who turns Philippe into another hideous fly-creature.  Can Francois save him from the same fate that Andre suffered?  RETURN OF THE FLY also co-stars Danielle de Metz (best-remembered as the Italian tourguide in ""Gidget Goes to Rome"") and John Sutton.

Things get a lot more gruesome and darker in THE CURSE OF THE FLY, filmed in 1965.  Andre Delambre's grandson Martin (George Baker) wants to carry on the family legacy, but the arrival of his lovely new wife Pat (Carole Gray), who escaped from a psychiatric hospital, complicates everything.  In the gloomy Delambre mansion, the deformed victims of ""failed experiments"" lurk, including Martin's former wife Judith (Mary Manson), and it's only a matter of time before Pat discovers the whole sickening truth...

Filmed on location in England (hence it's British stars George Baker and Carole Gray), CURSE OF THE FLY also features Brian Donlevy, Rachel Kempson, and Michael Graham.  Burt Kwouk and Yvette Rees (""Witchcraft"") are the Delambre's Asian house-servants, with the laughable names of Tai and Wan.  CURSE OF THE FLY was originally released in a theatrical double bill with ""Devils of Darkness"", another British horror title co-starring Carole Gray.

The bonus fourth disc, entitled ""Disc of Horrors"", includes a brief ten-minute featurette which touches on all three movies.  The 50-minute Biography episode for Vincent Price (""The Versatile Villain"") provides an absorbing portrait of a man whose interests and talents ran in many directions.  There are also selective photo galleries for each of the three ""Fly"" movies.  The four discs are housed in individual slimline cases, packed together in an attractive slipcover which displays key artwork from all three movies.  Each disc is single-layered; the movies themselves are in their correct 2:35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, enhanced for 16:9 displays.

This bargain-priced collectors' set is a must for all fans of classic horror.",1206662400,6,3895,5.332242225859247
1097675,5,6305951446,"I saw and bought it without hesitation. I love sci-fi from the 50's, so this was an unexpected delight. First, the images are great. I have never seen the original format of The Fly -- always on 4:3 TV. The sound is better than expected (4 channel!). The sequel is better than I remembered it. Very entertaining. The last movie I have to say surprised me: I've never seen it, which was a good reason to buy the set. A very good sci-fi thriller. Many lab scenes, which are of course required for sci-fi movies. Really creepy. Some reviewer mentioned that the chronology didn't make sense: the father in the third movie was a middle aged man yet the grandson of Hedison in the first. It's explained, sort of: the police inspector quickly mentions that when Phillippe (in Return) had his genes mixed with the fly, it gave him rapidly accelerated aging. It's still a good, fun movie.

I wish they made more movies like this now days. I've seen the remake, and it makes me sick. Too violent, gory, too much sex. If I am watching the original movies and a child entered the room, I wouldn't be bothered at all. But if a child walked in as I was watching the man-fly-machine mess blow its head off at the end of the remake, I would stop the player and turn off the tv. 50's movies were more innocent, and 20th Century (as well as other studios) still have some fun ones lurking in vaults just waiting for DVD release. I hope they hurry...I'm getting old.",1205625600,2,1447,4.419475655430712
1097676,4,6305951446,"While the 1950's will forever be THE decade of movie science fiction, Fox studios actually contributed very little to the genre during that time.  But they started the decade (well, in 1951) with one of the best-known and simply BEST films of its kind,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still/dp/B00005JKFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>, and in 1958 gave us one of the quintessential creatures of the era with THE FLY.  My own view is that the film's reputation looms a bit larger than its actual entertainment value.  The main problem, hardly an uncommon one for a low-budget film of this kind, is that it's all a bit talkly.  The title creature is only on-screen for a minute or two, and star Vincent Price is absent for large chunks of the running time.  Still, the script (based on a short story appearing in Playboy magazine a year earlier) is intelligent and the performances are more than adequate.

Price was lured back a year later for Return of the Fly, although he has been vocal over the years in his lack of enthusiasm for the film.  But as sci-fi/horror sequels go, it's not a bad effort.  With the ""more is more"" sequel mantra firmly in place, the story gives us more violence and more Fly.  The third film in the series, Curse of the Fly, is something of an anomaly.  It features the grandfather of the original film's scientist, but otherwise the film's continuity threads are quite thin.  As someone has pointed out, there is no ""fly"" in the film, which probably helps explain the disappointing reception it received upon release.

As for extras, the ""Disc of Horrors"" includes a too-brief documentary (all three films are covered in just 10 minutes), trailers and various still image galleries.  I have to say I was disappointed in the documentary, as a film of THE FLY's reputation certainly warrants a deeper exploration of its creation (by contrast, note that the doc included with Day the Earth Stood Still is longer than the movie itself!).  A & E's biography of Vincent Price is very well-done, though it was previously available on the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-of-Horror/dp/B0000C23H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes of Horror</a>.

All three films look and sound as good as they probably ever will, and are presented in their original Cinescope widescreen format.  For fans of fifites sci-fi, The Fly Collection has been a long time coming.  And while I maintain my opinion that the films are not quite classics, this is definitely a set worth owning.",1205452800,2,2643,5.314903846153846
1097677,2,6305951446,"I've encountered an exasperating technical problem on the Fly Collection bonus materials disc: Viewers are instructed to use the right skip/left skip remote buttons to move forward or backward through the still photo/ad art galleries, but whenever I did so a red slashed O flashed on screen, indicating that I'd requested an impossible function.  ( I had the same difficulty with Fox's Horror Classics (Lodger/Hangover Square/Undying Monster).  I e-mailed Fox - twice - about the problem; no reply.) This is a large disappointment, particularly in view of the fact that Fox's DVD packaging bears no disclaimer suggesting that any of the bonus material might be inaccessible to certain DVD players.",1199750400,9,697,5.327272727272727
1097678,3,6305951446,"These two films are both frequently over-looked by people who only remember the David Cronenberg version from the 1980's.

Firstly let me say right from the start that I enjoyed both these films, regardless of any reservations I may have about them. They are good quality horror films of the 1950's. Overall I rate the first film slightly higher than the second one, because its in colour and mainly because the first film has a much better ending than the second, which is a little too Hollywood for my liking.

For their time both films are actually pretty scary. In fact the 2nd film has one classic scene where regardless of the fact that you know what is going to happen, when it does it still makes you jump. By todays standards the special effects are primitive, but I was quite surprised how effective they were considering we are talking about films over 40 years old.

The acting and direction is generally of a decent standard and the only area where the films sometimes let themselves down relate to parts of the plot which don't quite follow logically.

So overall whilst these two films are certainly not masterpieces, they are much better than expected, and in a few key scenes quite haunting. You won't forget the phrase ""Help Me"" for a long time.",1196812800,5,1263,4.650224215246637
1097679,5,6305951446,"Ah, The Fly!  We all know it and love it, don't we?  It's the story of a scientist, Andre Delambre, who creates a teleportation device(here called a disintegrator/reintegrator).  It seems to work like a charm, but there are a few...bugs to work out(sorry I couldn't help it).  When he tries teleporting himself, he's unaware of a houselfy that snuck into the machine with him.  They get scrambled and Delambre is left with a fly head and arm.  The housefly is left with Delambre's human head and arm.  I'm no expert in science, but I highly doubt that switching heads with a fly would mean that the fly head would become human size and the human head would shrink.  But who cares, it's all in good fun.  The murderous fly instincts slowly start to overcome Delambre and he must find his smaller counterpart to reverse the process.  When all else fails, he decides to destroy himself and his work with the help of his wife.  The movie is told from the wife's point of view as she tells her story to her brother in law, Francois(Vincent Price!) and a police detective.  A great classic sci-fi film that manages not to be as corny as you might think.  Good acting all around and a pretty decent looking fly getup.  Includes the famous ""Help me!"" scene.
Next up....it's The Return of the Fly....with Vincent Price...You guinea pig...yeah, Return of the Flyyyyyy.  Sorry, I couldn't resist adding a little Misfits to the mix.  The Fly isn't a film that needed a sequel considering the whole premise was based on a random occurrence and a case of really bad luck.  It's still good though.  Andre's son, Phillippe is working on a teleportation device of his own(how convenient!)against the wishes of his uncle, Francois(Price again).  A doublecrossing partner lands Phillipe in the machine with....you guessed it....a fly(what are the odds of that, eh?).  Phillipe emerges as a homicidal fly headed monster, and once again the race is on to find the smaller counterpart before one of them dies.  Though fun, this one's a bit sillier.  It's more of a creature feature and has a been there/done that feeling.  The fly head is also quite laughable because it's jumbo sized this time.  Price is excellent as always.  Even when Price is cast in a silly movie, he never acts like he is.
Finally we got the Curse of the Fly.  This movie is much cooler than it's reputation would have you think.  The third generation of Delambres(two grandsons and their father.  Yes, the genealogy doesn't make too much sense) have nearly perfected the teleportation machine.  They have a setup in Quebec that can teleport them to London.  These Delambres should know by now not to mess with this teleportation crap anymore, but you know how movie scientists are.  Just ask Victor Frankenstein's two sons.  One of the grandsons gets smitten with an escapee mental patient he runs into and soon brings her home.  This doesn't sit well with dad who doesn't want the secret of their work leaked out to anybody.  Dad and son keep the failures of their experiments locked in a building near the house.  These are mutated and scarred humans.  Everything goes to hell when the son decides to tell his wife everything.  Plus the police are closing in.  The grandson in London is also fed up with whole thing.  And the mutants are restless!  It all ends with a neat twist.  Needless to say this one was different than the first two.  It wasn't great, but I admire the effort to take it in a different direction.  They could've easily(and stupidly) rehashed everything with a story about a Delambre somehow getting trapped in the machine with a fly again.
As stated before, the picture quality on these discs is great.  The commentary is informative, the documentary on Price is informative, and the packaging is awesome.  There's no reason whatsoever not to pick this up if you love these movies.  Hell, it's worth getting if you've only seen the first one.",1193788800,3,3918,4.72082717872969

1097800,5,6305951446,"I figure the first thing that anyone interested in this DVD collection is going to want to know is whether the picture transfer to the original ""The Fly"" is an improvement over the previous Fox DVD double feature of this movie and its immediate sequel, ""The Return of the Fly,"" released in 2000.  The answer is an emphatic, Yes!  The 16x9 anamorphic image for this 1958 Cinemascope movie is less grainy, slightly brighter and sharper, and has improved color with more accurate flesh tones.  The 4.0 Dolby Digital and Dolby Surround stereo are also an improvement over the previous release.  So, if that's important to you, you need to get the upgrade found here.

The transfer to the 1959 sequel appears to be the same one used before, but since that movie is in black & white and the 16x9 anamorphic transfer of the Cinemascope image looked fine before, this is no problem.  The second sequel in the collection, 1965's ""The Curse of the Fly,"" is making its DVD debute here and this Cinemascope film is also presented in a fine black & white 16x9 anamorphic transfer, with good sharpness and full gray scale.  No one should have any major complaints about the transfers of these movies, and each film has been given enough extras to satisfy all but the most finicky of fans.

The extras, besides a small booklet that's included with the set, are all on a fourth disc in the collection (Each movie is in its own slim case with original ad art on the covers and reproductions of each film's 1-sheet poster inside.) and these include still, ad and poster galleries, original trailers, pressbooks, a new ten-minute featurette on all the movies, and a 1997 A&E Network ""Biography"" of Vincent Price.  There's also a brief Fox Movietone newsreel segment of the original movie's premiere at the San Francisco Fox Theatre on July 16, 1958 that nostalgically captures an era in movie exploitation that's long dead.

The one extra that's included with the original film itself is a rambling, but often amusing and informative ""conversational"" commentary track between star and ""the fly"" himself, David ""Al"" Hedison, and film historian, David Del Valle.  The two men often cut each other off, but their talk flows smoothly and keeps up with a movie both are very fond of.  Hedison is actually quite amazing in his recall of a film now nearly fifty years old and, he informs us, was shot in just 18 days!

I wasn't too enthusiastic when I pre-ordered this DVD collection.  ""The Fly"" is a good but not a great sci-fi movie -- its ending is classic, but the movie itself is rather talky -- and I wasn't sure if the transfer would be much improved over what I already owned, but I took a chance and now that I've looked at this collection, I'm glad I have it.  Another very good job from Fox Home Entertainment.  They've been putting out some great DVD reissues of their older titles lately and I hope they keep it up.",1190160000,91,2902,4.649706457925636
1097801,4,6305951446,"Fox is releasing its series of the original ""The Fly"" films and even including a bonus disc of extra features in this set, most notably a biography of the great Vincent Price. Many people prefer Cronenburg's 1986 remake with Jeff Goldblum, but to me the original will always be best because the result was one of the creepiest horror films ever made without the capability of doing the kinds of special effects that were possible by the the time the 1980's remake was done. The contents are as follows:

Disc One - The Fly (1958) - This one is a classic of 1950's sci-fi/horror, and weds traditional horror - the idea of something half human/half insect - with the science of the atomic age that made it possible. It deals with the psychological issues of madness, of what it means to be human, and therefore with what it means to murder. Top acting jobs by everyone, including Vincent Price in a supporting role here, turn what could have been very campy material into one of the creepiest films ever.

Disc Two - The Return Of The Fly (1959) - This film takes a step down from the first film mainly because there is nothing novel going on here as there was in the first film, but you still have the great Vincent Price reprising his role as the dead scientist's brother, this time trying to convince his nephew not to follow down the same path as his father. In this film the half fly/half human output of the teleportation machine is a murder attempt rather than an accident, and there is more emphasis on action rather than the psychological angles of the first.

Disc Three - The Curse Of The Fly (1965) - Vincent Price is not in this one since by this time he was under contract to another studio. However, I found this film to be better than its reputation. The Delambres, despite what has happened in the two previous films, have continued to experiment with the teleporter. The result has been more subtle but just has horrific. Now the Delambres are a family with various physical and mental ailments that are in danger of disintegration if an answer cannot be found. Oddly enough, after all the tragedy, they still think the answer to their troubles is the the teleporter. Many people don't like this film because it is quite a departure from the first two, but I think that is its strength.

1097803,5,6305951446,"""The Fly"" is a definite must see because of Patricia Owens, her outstanding performance truly carries this movie.  What an underrated performance she gives.  From such a fantastical premise, Ms. Owens creates a most believable character, one in which the audience can emphathize with. In an odd way, for a movie about a man with a fly's head,it's heart is in the right place.  Ms. Owens does what she does for the love of her husband and her son. Without her, this movie would be just like many other 50's sci fi/horror movies. Her spectaular performance lifts this admittedly silly scenario into the realm of unforgettable, classic movie performances.",1153526400,,652,4.963302752293578

It just so happens this is slated for rerelease from Fox with extras. This is a great movie and so is Return of the Fly.",1147651200,5,292,4.140350877192983
1097805,5,6305951446,"I ordered this 2 DVD set, including both the original ""The Fly"" and ""Return of the Fly"" starring Vincent Price, the ""Grand Seigneur"" (the Master) of the fantasy and sci-fi genre.

I am glad I did.

I could have ordered the remake and its counterpart ""The Fly II"", but I preferred to start at the beginning and I was right.

The classics may have less sophisticated SFXs (Special Effects), but the acting is far superior. The ambience of the two, typically Fifties, adds to the charm of the whole.

The music is tense, but not overbearing as in eighties movies and the screaming girl is there, where one wants her, and at the right time too...

Who can forget the finale of the original ""The Fly"", almost a work of slapstick comedy, but so dramatically funny.

The second and follow-up, ""Return of the Fly"" is not so brilliant, lacking the glamour of color (although in CinemaScope), and its story comes and goes, but still a valid sequel for those very campy ""drive-in"" movies.

Whilst in the first, Vincent Price is just the shoulder to Al Hedison, in the second he truly becomes the star of the action.

Everyone who loves that particular feeling of Fifties Widescreen movies, won't be disappointed.

Both are not to be considered as Horror movies, or just Science Fiction ones, although elements of both genres are present, no, more likely, I would call them a twist in the ""Film Noir"" genre.

In fact, especially in the first one, the entire plot is told while a Police investigation is being conducted, to clarify a vicious murder case.

In the second, we have more of a crime movie, in which a mobster is blackmailing the hero, with obvious tragic consequences.

While watching these two installments, one has to keep in mind that in the Fifties, Science Fiction and Horror movies were considered a minor and secondary genre.

The taste of the time were Western Spectaculars and Crime Movies, such as said, the so-called ""Film Noir"".

Combining both in a Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre was a truly daring move, as well as a touch of pure genius.

Doing so, allowed the producers to take some liberties with its contents, emphasizing some elements and exagerating others, to build the necessary tension in style and reaching a well constructed climax at the end.

Both movies are more than worth the money spent, even for newcomers to the Fifties movies.

While the '80s version has its own appeal, being more modern and adding some truly scary effects to the story, it does not make it more interesting or more appealing to the viewers.

I like Jeff Goldblum as an actor, but I cannot see him stealing the seat of Vincent Price.

Granted, he does not play his role. While in the Fifties you have a happy Canadian family, with at its head, a hard-working scientist, we in the '80s, receive an eccentric scientist who slowly goes mad and moreover is a solitary guy with a lose tie to a female journalist.

This for ""The Fly"" Part One. For Part Two, we also have differences. As said, ""Return of the Fly"" (1959) is more a Crime Movie with the legendary rescue of the hero and the its final revenge scene. ""The Fly II"", in 1988, is a fumbled attempt to create a sequel.

Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are gone altogether. They don't even get a chance at Cameo roles. We have totally unknown actors in something that is meant to be a new story altogether.

In ""Return of the Fly"" we have Vincent Price reprising his original role and stealing the show.

Nevertheless, now that both versions are out, when in doubt, buy them both. Also the 1980s ""The Fly"" series is available in a compact collection and also at an affordable price.

My suggestion to you, the viewers, is to buy them both and then compare them for yourselves.

But be warned. If you have a faint heart, the '80s collection is rather gory and could cause you some visual shocks, while the '50s versions are more stylized and a lot is left to your imaginations to work out.

It is up to you.",1141171200,4,3946,4.5934379457917265
1097806,5,6305951446,"i saw this film many years ago in my early 20s and was impressed. innovative filmmaking for its era, THE FLY still manages to intrigue today. the concept of teleportation of solid matter, living or inanimate is a concept that has been pondered for many years. to disclose any major details of the plot would only deprive anyone who hasn't seen this little gem of the enjoyment of watching the first time.

i purchased this film for THE FLY only, but the other feature included, RETURN OF THE FLY, is watchable but inferior to its predecessor. avoid the remake with Jeff Goldblum. the only redeeming that one has is its modern use of special effects.

as for the DVD, the transfer is great. the colors are vibrant and rich. the audio is good too. no real extras, but who cares. it would make a good addition to anyone's library.",1129507200,3,827,4.543624161073826
1097807,5,6305951446,"Yes, this is the apex of all sci-fi horror giant bug '50's late night drive in movies. Absolutely. So it starts with a woman smashing her man in a giant steam press. She smashes twice. When the reason for that is revealed, it is truly horrifying. Anyway, the movie of interest is a flashback from that scene. The woman's husband is one of these lucky scientists who have a fabulous modern laboratory in the basement of their houses. Within this basement, he has invented a way to transmit mass from one point to another by making a loud irritating noise and flashing a very bright light. It works, most of the time, for inanimate objects that do not have writing on them. However, when two critters, say a man and a housefly, get transported together...the fun begins. You know, I have seen the modern Cronenberg/Goldblum version of this movie and it is disgusting. This version conveys a lot of that disgust without the stomach churning quality of the newer one. MUCH prefered. I mean, you get it when you hear him eating, and when he tries to canoodle with his wife for the last time...eeeeeeee!!!!!

Anyway, this is an entertaining film with a genuinely scary ending (freaked out my 13 year old. I can agitate her by saying ""help...me!"" now. Great tool to have I must say). Performances are not that good, Vincent Price is is usual fey and stiff self. But the horror is there without the gross-out, and the truly scary ending (in spite of the teddy bear-like spider) all make it highly recommended.",1125014400,3,1501,4.642857142857143
1097888,5,6305951446,"The man defying the Gods in Greek sense, like a modern Prometheus, seems to be the message between lines

About this sordid tale about a scientist who experiments with a disintegrating machine and has his obvious parallelism with the nuclear paradox . When Icarus flied closer the sun his wax wings simply melted and then he died falling to the sea: superb, greed and excess of self stem among other ephitets were the main causes of this disgrace: Help me, help me.

Almost forty years have elapsed since its release and this sci fi maintains its profile due perhaps, it cointains the essential elements of a mythical fable.

Consider this film among the emblematic quintet of the most pyramidal pictures which dealt with  this genre: Them, Invasion of the body snatchers, The thing, I married with a monster from the outer space.",1111449600,3,830,4.823943661971831
1097889,4,6305951446,"The Fly is a true classic. A woman is arrested for crushing her husband in a steam press, she seems rather mellow about it, doing what she had to do, and it's up to the detective and her brother-in-law (Vincent Price) to make her tell the story - a flash-back. What follows is a truly disturbing tale of a scientific experiment gone terribly wrong, the concept being hilarious and truly horrible at the same time, while the matter-of-factly treatment sets the perfect mood.
The image-transfer is adequate, but the colours seem a little washed out. Although Return of the Fly is rubbish it's of course an appropriate B-side feature. It has a few incitingly surreal images, the protagonist running around the country side with an enormous bug head for example. Being in black and white it looks better than the first one.",1078185600,,819,4.774647887323944
1097890,5,6305951446,"""The Fly"" is a well made / known sci-fi classic. Andre (David Hedison) is a scientist, working on a contraption that disintegrates solid matter, sending it to another location to be re-integrated. Andre wants to develop it for the good of mankind, but that would make for one dull movie! Instead, he accidentally enters the disintegration chamber with an undetected fly. The two become fused into one being. Andre ends up with a fly head and claw. The fly gets Andre's head and upper body. Andre's wife is tested to the depths of her love for her now hideous husband. A frantic search for the tiny fly ensues (maybe they could de-fuse them??) with tragic results. Vincent Price is excellent as Andre's brother. Yes, it's true that ""Return Of The Fly"" is nowhere near as good as it's predocessor. However, I like having them both together anyway. Andre's son Phillipe is all grown up and decides to continue his father's work. He enlists the help of a guy who turns out to be a sociopathic criminal, bent on stealing the invention and selling it to an accomplice. After killing a nose-y cop (by turning him into a rather ridiculous guinea pig man!), he knocks Phillipe out and puts him in the disintegration cabinet with a suspiciously handy fly. The rest of the film is a revenge story. I like the crooks and the way Phillipe avenges their treachery. While watching, be sure to check the house for those pesky insects!... >>UPDATE 12-6-15>> Well, since amazon has lumped the reviews for the old double feature-THE FLY / RETURN OF THE FLY dvd in w/ the 3-movie set- THE FLY COLLECTION, including CURSE OF THE FLY, then I might as well review that too! CURSE is very different from the first two films. It opens w/ a woman named Patricia Stanley (Carole Gray), dressed only in her underwear, escaping a mental institution. She encounters Martin Delambre (George Baker) and love blooms. Little does Patricia know, that something is terribly wrong w/ Martin. Something involving his family's infamous teleportation experiments, now conducted by his father. Henri (Brian Donlevy- THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT aka: THE CREEPING UNKNOWN, ENEMY FROM SPACE). This time, the experiments have gone even further, causing strange mutations. One gruesome, undulating mutant is particularly memorable! CURSE OF THE FLY has a darker, more sinister atmosphere than either of its predecessors. The mad science involved has taken on a more diabolical quality. While the disintegration / re-integration machines have returned, there is no ""Delambre-fly"". Actually, this is quite refreshing, as one more ""rubber-fly-head"" movie would have been silly. A worthy addition to the FLY legacy...",1058486400,3,2664,5.029411764705882
1097891,4,6305951446,"I enjoyed 'The Fly' a lot. A good sci-fi story with a dash of 'don't mess with mother nature' thrown in...and after all these years, it still retains a lot of it's creepiness. The plot is pretty out there, but I think the actors did a really good job with their performances. The special effects seemed a little understated, but, for me, that worked to the movies' advantage. I always thought it was interesting that while Vincent Price was in this movie, he really didn't play a main character or have much to do with the more macabre features of the movie. He more or less played it straight, but I liked that, seeing him playing role where he isn't exuding that sinister aura that he does in a lot of his movies. I also think this is a beautiful looking transfer with vibrant colors. And the end still always gives me a shiver up my spine. A solid movie overall.
'The Return of the Fly' suffers from an obvious lack of originality and financial support. It is in black and white, while the original was in color. I don't have an issue with this as I think some movies look better in black and white, but I was a little disappointed in how closely story in this sequel matched that of the original. And the fly head and fly arm used in this movie seemed more comical, played up for visual effect while the fly head and fly arm in the first movie were more understated, and, to me, worked more effectively. Basically, this seems more of a remake than a sequel, with a few new things.
If you like sci-fi, then I think this DVD is a really good addition to your collection, and having both movies on one disc is certainly a decent value. The four stars I gave are for the original, while I would only give the sequel about 2 1/2 stars.",1050624000,8,1734,4.3058103975535165
1097892,4,6305951446,"This double disc presents two horror movies from the 1950s: the classic Fly and the not-so-classic sequel, The Return of the Fly.  Although neither movie is close to perfect, they are good enough for some fun, old-fashioned entertainment.
In The Fly, a scientist experiments in his basement lab on a matter transmission device that he is certain will solve all of humanity's problems.  An experiment on himself, however, goes awry when a fly gets into the works.  Although often cheesy, this is a generally solid work that avoids a lot of the standard mad scientist cliches and also has at least two real classic scenes:  a ""fly's-eye-view"" of the scientist's screaming wife and one of the concluding scenes, with a fly with a human head caught in a spider web.
The sequel, however, is a step or two below in quality, little more than a standard monster movie.  In it, the son of the original character continues his father's experiments and through the malicious act of a partner, winds up similarly transformed.  As a follow-up to the original, it is barely okay, but as a standalone, it offers little worthwhile.
As a twosome, this pair rates a low four stars.  If you like 1950's style monster movies, this should be a pleasure, but if you are looking for any sort of truly great movies, you might want to look elsewhere.",1048896000,,1325,4.734782608695652
1097893,4,6305951446,"I got into the remake and its sequel because I heard, in other movies I watched, references to the first. Then when I was old enough to watch horror movies, and got into the old black-and-white classics, like ""DRACULA"", ""FRANKENSTEIN"", ""THE WOLF MAN"", and ""THE INVISIBLE MAN"", I decided to give them a try. So I rented them. It took me a while to get used to them, but now, I'm into them and I own them. They're both awesome, but kinda gross. Then after getting into those two, I ended up liking and wanting to own the oringinal two from the 1950's with Vincent Price that started this whole thing about THE FLY. While both of these look kinda fake and boring and may no longer shock or horrorify like they did at the time of their release, they haven't lost the power to fascinate. And I don't find them boring at all.
In the first one, a man named Andre Delambre ( Al ""David"" Hedison ) is a scientist who's just made a remarkable discovery: Two devices. One of them can transport an object to the next. When he finally gets it right, he sucessfully transports himself. Then he tries to do it again, but doesn't know that a pesky housefly gets in there with him. Now, he's got the enlarged head and arm of a fly and the fly has his shrunken head and arm. Now, his wife, Helene ( Patricia Owens ) is his only hope to get back to normal.
In the second one, it's 20 to 30 years later and Andre's son, Phillipe ( Brett Halsey ) is a grown man and wants to continue his late father's work. Although his uncle Francois ( Andre's brother from the first, played by Vincent Price ) warns him about the dangers of it, he goes ahead and does it anyway, with the help of his assistant, Alan Hinds ( David Frankham ). Everything seems to be safe and doing well, but Alan is a criminal who plans to steal the secret and sell it to the highest bidder. And when Phillipe finds out, he and Alan get into a fight and Alan traps Phillipe in the device, along with another pesky housefly, and now, Phillipe is just like what his father was. Now, Phillipe goes out to, not just find a way to get back to normal, but to give Alan his come-uppance.
For the first one, I will give 3 stars. And for the second one, 4 stars. And for this DVD, 4 stars. Just like the one with the remake and its sequel, this double-feature DVD works beautifully, although it doesn't have a special or a commentary by a film historian on both movies.
The reasons I think the second one is a bit better than the first are: The music score, the storyline, and the villians of the second one. Those are the differences between the first and the second. The villians of the second are an example of how the second one is different than the first. The first one didn't have any villians. Most of it was just romance and drama.
If you're a big movie buff like I am, I'm sure you'll like these two. I recommend both these movies. They're just as much fun as the remake and its sequel are. See my review of them ( THE FLY / THE FLY 2. ) It's titlied: AVERAGE REMAKE, ABOVE AVERAGE SEQUEL, LIKE THE ORIGINALS.",1014681600,2,3056,4.225641025641026
1097894,4,6305951446,"The only reason this Fox DVD doesn't get a 5-star review is the lack of extras.  Both films are presented widescreen and the quality is stunning.

The scientific premise behind both movies is sound as a dollar: Anyone transmitting himself along with a fly will come out with the head and insectoid malevolence of a fly. Of course! Okay, one might wonder about all the parasitic organisms living like squatters on every human body, like the dust mites on your eyelashes, for example, and question why a person doesn't come out part human, part fly and part dust mite, but those questions are reserved for people with nothing better to think about, like me.
For the rest of humanity, both The Fly and Return of the Fly deliver the goods. This double feature DVD is a gem, highly recommended.",1007078400,,847,4.72972972972973
1097896,5,6305951446,"THE FLY is one of those rare 1950s-era flicks that successfully combines the science fiction and horror genres into a genuinely literate and, yes, scary piece of entertainment.  The pseudo-scientific babble may seem less plausible in light of the advancements in genetics that have occurred since 1958, but the script is tight and the story gripping, the acting is top-notch, and the creepy spider-web scene still manages to haunt viewers long after the movie has ended.
By now, of course, the basic plot of this film is well known.  When a scientist experimenting with the electronic teleportation of matter uses himself as a guinea pig, some of his atoms are inadvertently mixed with those of a housefly that has managed to sneak into the machinery with him, and the result is quite a pesky problem for the scientist, his loving wife, and his milquetoast brother.
Vincent Price delivers one of his best performances ever in THE FLY.  More restrained and earnest than in his later wonderful but over-the-top performances of the '60s and 70's, Price is very affecting as Francois Delambre, a meek businessman who, in coping with his brother's hideous accident, must comfort his sister-in-law while staving off the overzealous police.  The beautiful Patricia Owens gives a strong performance as Helene Delambre, a woman who finds the inner strength she needs to protect her husband, even though protecting him might also mean destroying him.  And David Hedison, as scientist Andre Delambre, and Herbert Marshall, as Inspector Charas, also do quite adequately.
Even after almost 45 years, the special effects in THE FLY hold up quite well.  Although the depiction of computers is a bit outdated, the teleporation effects are very convincing.  They are just flashy enough to give a sense of technological wonder, but restrained enough to avoid that  garish visual hyperbole common to a lot of '50s sci-fi.  So, too, with the make-up effect for the human-fly hybrid.  It is quite realistic and eerie, and it still manages to shock modern viewers in spite of all the amazing advancements in cinema make-up that have taken place since.
There are, of course, the inevitable comparisons with David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the film.  Cronenberg's version is admittedly more in-tune with modern scientific knowledge.  Also, his special effects are more modern and very realistic, and his actors are superb working with a script that is quite literate.  But in many ways the original 1958 version is much more engaging, and it has a climax that is, psychologically speaking, much creepier.  Cronenberg's film may be a masterpiece of modern sci-fi horror, but the 1958 version of THE FLY is undoubtedly a classic.
This DVD version of THE FLY comes paired with 1959's THE RETURN OF THE FLY.  In spite the presence of Price in a reprise of his role in the original film, this sequel is far inferior to the first.  The story is weak, the special effects are cheesy, and, with the exception of Price, the acting is sub-par. However, the DVD is very modestly priced, making it worth purchasing just to get original THE FLY.",1005782400,2,3110,4.998062015503876
