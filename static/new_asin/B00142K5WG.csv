8254076,5,B00142K5WG,"I have been a fan of Charlie and Eric for a while now and bought this DVD to pick up on some different proven flies that I don't see out west.  These are great patterns that have worked in my area and their style of tying makes it easy to perfect.  I would recommend this to anyone from a beginning tyer to more advanced.  I wouldn't say this should be your first one, but none of the patterns are too difficult and can be cranked out pretty quickly.",1281916800,,450,4.090909090909091
