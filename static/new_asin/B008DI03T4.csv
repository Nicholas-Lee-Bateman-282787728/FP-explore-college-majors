5153372,1,B008DI03T4,there were at least seven dvds that had episodes that wouldn't play or that would freeze moments into the episode. They were all still individually packaged and factory sealed so they must have come from a janky manufacturer.,1419638400,15,225,4.947368421052632
5153373,5,B008DI03T4,Brand new DVDs still in the wrapper delivered in a timely fashion. Great purchase!,1419552000,,82,4.928571428571429
5153374,5,B008DI03T4,It's the first 15 seasons of south park with bonus features. Great sound and picture quality. Having fun watching from episode one onward. Really can't go wrong here,1416787200,4,165,4.928571428571429
5153375,1,B008DI03T4,"I was really exicted when they arrived great packaging and it came a day early when I opened the package I noticed the firs thing wrong with the package the size is too small the size of the dvds were smaller than than the blu ray seasons of south park. I noticed that there were two seasons which were the normal size season 15 and 16 which are shown in the picture the rest are fake. I decided maybe they are a different region so I opened season 14 which I had and I decided to take out for comparison between the two first of heres a little fact a regular south park season has five flaps which holds the dvd and includes artwork, a blu ray season has four flaps. I opened the box and the disk is out of color and bad  audio is ok no good low frequencys video looks muddy.",1415059200,15,776,4.038961038961039
5153376,5,B008DI03T4,Really good quality. Came brand new.,1413072000,3,36,5.166666666666667
5153377,4,B008DI03T4,It arrived quickly--however some of the discs do not work.,1408665600,2,58,4.9
5153378,5,B008DI03T4,My husband took a full week off of work so we could veg and watch this and spend time together. Who would have thought SP could bring a couple together. Haha,1406246400,5,157,4.096774193548387
5153379,3,B008DI03T4,Great. Except some (1 in 20) episodes skip or don't play correctly,1404086400,2,66,4.583333333333333

5153381,5,B008DI03T4,I bought this for my son and it came with more episodes than advertised. 5 star when that happens. He is very happy!!,1397001600,2,117,4.130434782608695
5153382,5,B008DI03T4,"They all came seasons 1-16 and I thought it was until 15 but season 16 was included but all the others are factory sealed and they are all wrapped up in a giant wrapper from Comedy Central with a sticker from the studios.
And as far as the moron Casey who gave the bad review doesn't the person understand that it's 15 seasons not disks!!! I guess that person rode the short bus!!! The only problem I had was how long it took to get here.",1390780800,5,438,4.104651162790698
5153383,4,B008DI03T4,"I give this a 4 star rating as a show because I feel the ratings vary from from 3-5 stars from season to season.  As a collection, I give this 4 stars because this product is not a single box set of seasons 1-15; this is a lot that collects all of the individual box sets of seasons 1-15.  As far as I know, a single box set does not exist, and this is the closest way to buy the complete series at one time (Season 16 is also now available).  In other words, if you've always wanted to have a South Park DVD collection, this is the way to do it.  South Park lovers will not be disappointed...  as long as they receive the product as advertised.

I recommend doing some research of the sellers/dealers before you buy.  There's a lot of counterfeit and Chinese versions of these box sets floating around out there.  If you want the authentic DVDs, you are probably better off paying the higher prices or buying used.  Buying this set NEW in individual units costs between $215-$250 (give and take occasional discounts), and that does not include shipping costs.  It's not often the NEW retail price for this collection will be less than $200 outside of a huge sales event like Black Friday, so be very skeptical.",1390435200,8,1211,4.390134529147982
5153384,1,B008DI03T4,"I read the product description and something smells fishy - 15 seasons of South Park fitting on only 15 DVDs.

Hmmm, how is that possible?",1389830400,3,138,4.52
5153385,3,B008DI03T4,some disks like 2 are empty every time i try to play them i get a error message that theirs no data,1388880000,5,99,3.5454545454545454

Thank you!!

5153387,4,B008DI03T4,It is South Park...what more can you say if you enjoy this type of humor!  I will say that the place through Amazon that I purchased my set was extremely slow to ship it to me.  Make sure you get your tracking number information and contact the seller for shipping updates!,1386979200,2,273,4.333333333333333
5153388,5,B008DI03T4,"Great deal for the price. My Husband has been wanting more South Park, as he only has 2 seasons, and at $25 a piece I never bought them. So getting 15 for $150 is a steal!",1385942400,4,171,3.7777777777777777
5153389,5,B008DI03T4,"I bought this set as a gift for my sister whose birthday is July 28th! So, as of yet it is unopened. Thanks for the great delivery!",1373587200,,131,3.888888888888889
8527009,1,B008DI03T4,"The photo makes it look like you're getting a boxed set, or at least matching sets, but that's not the case.
Save yourself some money and but each season separately for $7-10 each (& they'll actually be packaged the same)",1522800000,,221,4.55
8527010,5,B008DI03T4,"I now have ( as of today ) EVERY SEASON

8527012,1,B008DI03T4,I bought seasons 1-15 (New) separately for about $180. I think this is a bit overpriced.,1472601600,3,88,4.5625
8527013,5,B008DI03T4,This is amazing becuase you can get every season,1460505600,,48,4.444444444444445

8527016,1,B008DI03T4,Worst product ever seriously if I could get you negative stars I would.... I complained about the fact that almost every 2-3 episode on a disk didn't play I could understand a couple but when it happens almost every disk somethings going on I contacted the seller bc amazon wouldn't do anything... the seller said let us know which episodes don't work I said the entire thing needs replaced and I'm not waiting my time to watch hours of freezing up dvds just buy the regular  one one by one,1456099200,15,490,4.444444444444445
8527017,1,B008DI03T4,"We ordered this set because it shows all the DVDs to be the same editions. (similar packaging and DVD features).  This is not the case.  While the product is the true seasons 1-15 episodes, the packaging and set was not what was expected at all. It was a very hodge-podge collection. I could have bought each individual season for $100.00 cheaper, and will do so from another retailer.",1454630400,14,385,4.647058823529412
