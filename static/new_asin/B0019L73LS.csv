8274352,4,B0019L73LS,"(BOUGHT THIS FROM AMAZON USA,SINCE AMAZON UK ONLY HADTHE 2CD -PLEASANTLY SURPRISED HOW QUICK IT GOT HERE!)

A"" sheer curiosity"" buy was this - found some fan videos on YouTube(**),struck by ""parallels"" with ""Black Symphony"" DVD by Within Temptation, who are very important to me. Sebnem's 2007 DVD was both filmed and released a year BEFORE the WT one - maybe all down to two ""great minds thinking alike"",using the same state of the art live music tech & mega ultra-widescreen video screens etc ..and no doubt having the same dash of luck it all worked ""alright on the night""!

The single DVD gives 21 tracks (140 mins)of the full concert, basically symphonic rock though also with some metal, Turkish, jazz (including ""big band"") elemenet in the mix,plus not least Soul elements in Sebnem's powerful,all-Turkish vocals.

One or two of the previously viewed fan videos offered English translations ,hinting of possible further Den Adel/ Ferah ""parallels""in the lyrics, however the DVD itself makes no attempt to translate, neither the songs (which of course is fair enough)nor even the ""making of ..."" type ""Extras"" (indicating the producers never expected the DVD to attract any interest outside Turkey itself?)

Just one real ""minus"": the video producer often gets a little too carried away with exploring the outer limits of the editing suite - mercifully not on every track, but one time or another we get just about every which way split screen you can imagine, plus Sebnem duetting face to face with Sebnem etc. Its all a bit irritating and gimmicky, as if out to ""upstage""......annoying enough to cost  a Star on what SHOULD have ben a clear ""Five""!

(**)So how did I find my way here in the first place? A Youtube surf through some ""Giersbergen guestings"" offered one of Anneke with most of her band singing in Turkish with Hapko Cepkin and part of his .From there was offered Cepkin with Ferah, then clips of this CD. But where did I first come across Anneke ... where else but guesting on ""Black Symphony""!",1346976000,,2111,5.122093023255814
8274353,4,B0019L73LS,"There seem to be two types of live albums - the kind where artists offer fresh interpretations, arrangements, or energy, and the type where they interact with the fans and don't sing the words that the fans all know and sing.

The latter is more intimate, but it requires the listener to know the studio versions of the songs.  Unfortunately, this happens in several of the songs on this album.  What makes this harder is that her studio albums are not generally available in the U.S.A..

So, check her out on YouTube, get addicted to her, and then buy this album and hope for the day when her other stuff becomes available here.",1275177600,,629,4.539823008849558
