8293798,3,B001DJ7PXW,This is a fabulous collection of interviews and the SPORTSCENTURY show on Mike Tyson which is fascinating viewing.  The fight section has 6 fights. The Ringside Tyson 2 DVD collection has 19 fights and an hour of interviews so I give it the edge if you are a Tyson collector you may want both (all 6 of the fights on this are also on the Ringside Tyson 2 DVD set if that helps?),1244160000,13,378,4.178082191780822
8293799,5,B001DJ7PXW,"This dvd is cool as it has all new documentries on Iron Mike Tyson,no matter what you say about Iron Mike Tyson,his record as the youngest heavyweight boxing champion in history will take some beating and remains up there as one of the greatest records in all of world wide sports,it is just a shame Mike let money and woman destroy him,as he could have become the greatest of all time.",1226707200,3,386,4.450704225352113
