7949779,1,B00005Q64X,I don't understand about this product. Reviews say its 4h long and 2 CDs which matches with what is selling on BarnesNobel. However on this product description it says 1 CD and 1.5h long? And is the same price as Barnes?,1513209600,,220,4.390243902439025
7949780,5,B00005Q64X,Arrived on time and intact.  Very informative and extremely interesting.,1437004800,,72,6.2
7949781,5,B00005Q64X,"This is, without doubt, among the top three documentary DVD sets about naval history -- focusing on the battleship and its' origins.  The historic footage in itself is spectacular with the addition of informative modern film shot on location aboard historic warships.  I have studied warships, their history, and their design for well over 50 years and the facts in the documentary are 99% accurate.  For the big-gun-battleship lover -- THIS IS A MUST!",1350604800,2,452,5.081081081081081
7949782,5,B00005Q64X,"If you love battleships and naval history then you will LOVE these DVDs.

I break these out whenever I can and watch them again and again.  I love hearing the history (and folly) of countries spending massive amount of money building battleships to the point of bankrupting their countries.  All the while the battleships were not decisive in any major war.

Learn how the battleships evolved from wooden vessels with cannons to massive steal behemoths with 18 inch guns, the battles they fought in the two world wars, and how air power rendered them virtually obsolete.

The videos and narratives are great.  Lots of pictures and clips of the dreadnought era Battleship Texas, moored in Houston.

These are a great buy for guys that love big ships.",1288742400,2,749,4.850393700787402
7949783,5,B00005Q64X,"I taped this 4hr set on the History chanel .When it came out VHS I bought the set. When it cane out on DVD I bought the 2disk set. Ilove this Battleship documentry I view all 4hrs at least once a month,some times more. I buy all battleship ,submarine,aircraft carriers,WW2 that catches my eye. This set of 4hr Battleship stories are the Best.",1282435200,2,342,4.444444444444445
7949784,5,B00005Q64X,The 'The Complete History of the Battleship: 1916 - Present' and the earlier volume are two of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Both are very well done. This volume covers from Jutland to Korea and includes good coverage of the carrier war in the Pacific. Great footage and even better historical narration. If you have any interest in naval warfare you will want both of these documentaries.,1165190400,5,400,4.811594202898551
