3871747,5,B00284EMCS,Celtic Voyage is a great investment in understanding the Irish culture and Irish life. A great introduction and if you go :  )  a treasure to have watched!!,1341705600,,156,4.535714285714286
3871748,5,B00284EMCS,This is a great travel dvd. It is alittle out of date but the information is very good. This shows alot of the places that you may want to see if you are planing a trip to Ireland like I did. And many of the places in this dvd package are places I visited while I was in Ireland.,1339027200,,279,3.7457627118644066
3871749,5,B00284EMCS,"This is an excellent 3 video series, well presented and anyone who has been to Ireland would love this ~ a mixture of its beauty, gorgeous scenery, and a wee bit of history to fill everyone's needs.  Received in a timely fashion, reasonably priced for the package ~ very pleased.",1335312000,4,279,4.58
3871750,4,B00284EMCS,"These were good. Not great, but good. The reason I don't think they are great is because there was too much focus on musicians, dancers and even acting. All of these things are wonderful and I have many DVDs with all three BUT I bought this particular set to learn more about the land of my ancestors...I wanted to see more of the villages, the country landscape, the cities. While there was some of each, it was not enough to satisfy me. They just about took a glance at The Burren and gave no information at all about this fascinating part of Ireland. Again...I'm not totally displeased with these DVDs, but I would definitely would have loved the ""Fascinating Journey Through Ireland"" that was promised, with a little more focus on places of interest and a little less focus on entertainment.",1302048000,30,795,4.6453900709219855
3871751,2,B00284EMCS,"This video tried to use the ""Visions"" template but fails. Although the videography is not bad, the transitions are non-existent or are very poorly done. There is a pre-occupation with Irish music and dance with long boring shots of expressionless musicians droning on with monotonous Irish music. Not enough narrative to keep your attention. Also many shots are repeated in the three discs. Content seems to be from the the early 2000's and does not reflect conditions in Ireland today at all. Just there last year and the Celtic Tiger is dead!! Would not buy again and will make someone a good deal if they wanted to buy the series!!",1298246400,24,634,4.7727272727272725

3871757,1,B00284EMCS,Very DATED. Three discs and too many repeated segments from one disc to the next. A waste of time and money. Poor video quality.,1382313600,7,128,4.375

3871761,3,B00284EMCS,I ordered these DVDS because I was traveling to Ireland and wanted to quickly catch up on the history.  There is a lot of information and beautiful scenery but this did not hold our attention. Watching it after the trip will probably be more useful,1347062400,9,248,4.511111111111111

8355679,1,B00284EMCS,"Don't waste your money.  These videos are more about promoting difference B&Bs, restaurants, and infrequently visited sites.  If they spend one more minute talking about the canals, I thought i would fall asleep.",1436918400,,212,5.393939393939394
