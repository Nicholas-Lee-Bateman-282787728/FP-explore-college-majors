8316130,2,B000FH90HC,"So, there's no point in reviewing these four ""Classic"" John Wayne movies on their own, since they're all exactly the same thing. John Wayne comes into town, meets Gabby Hayes, gets into some shenanigans and then kisses some annoying girl.

I appreciate all the stunt riding and gun slinging that went into these 1930's Lone Star Productions films, but unfortunately they're so poorly produced it's hard to notice the good stuff. And Digiview piles some extra crap onto the last film on the disc by adding some unnecessary, hackey background synth music. If you're a huge John Wayne fan then this budget disc is a good way to see some of his early budget movies, but I can't think of another reason to reccommend this.

Here are the four movies on the disc:
The Dawn Rider (1935)
Blue Steel (1934)
The Lucky Texan (1934)
The Man from Utah (1934)",1272412800,6,844,4.657718120805369
