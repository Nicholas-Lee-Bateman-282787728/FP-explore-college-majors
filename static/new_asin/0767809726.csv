7043,3,0767809726,"Film boasts some of the best New Orleans scenery. For anyone who has visited this city, it creates nostalgia immediately. One of Gere's lesser works but has plenty action. Bassinger was there for her body. Service was great.",1241395200,,224,4.921052631578948
7044,3,0767809726,"Although the film is a bit dated, it is worth watching for Kim Basinger's performance as an illiterate bayou girl.  Compare this performance with the super smart callgirl in LA Confidential -- she does have range.

Buy it used at the cheapest price -- you won't be disappointed.",1234310400,9,278,4.770833333333333
7045,3,0767809726,"Richard Gere is the tough Chicago cop who goes to the Big Easy to track down the killer of his partner. This killer is a much feared hood in New Orleans named Losado. While down there Gere runs into Kim Basinger, a ""slave"" of Losado's, and he becomes determined to free her as well as kill Losado. This is all very typical thriller fare, although it can be pretty suspenseful at times--especially in the bayous and, of course, the big ending where Gere gets his man in a nail-biting shoot out and fire. But after you've seen this, ask yourself the next day how much you can remember. Note: There's a scene in the picture that's stolen directly from Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"": Gere and Basinger are handcuffed together as they make their escape through the swamps.",1111536000,3,764,4.583941605839416
7046,1,0767809726,"A cop's partner is killed, and poor Richard feels he has to go and take care of the bad guy that did it.  Richard's wife has left him and he now is divorced, so Kim, who is a white slave of the bad guy, ads more reason for Richard to go after the bad guy.  Besides, Kim was there when Richard's partner was done in.
THE GOOD
Not much, Kim Bassinger is pretty to look at, and that is about it.
THE BAD
Richard and Kim along with rest of the cast, seem to be going thru the motions of acting.  Richard has the same blank stare that he has in most of his moves.  Living close to New Orleans, they did not take advantage of the local landscape.  This movie could have been filmed anywhere.  They do not know how to eat Crawfish in the movie, a southern treat. The Final fight scene is poorly shot.
C.P.O.V
The F word is used alot, along with other foul language.  Kim's breast are shown thru her wet shirt as she poors water down blouse to cool off.  The killings are pretty bloodless, compared to today's standards.  Not a lot of killings in this movie anyway.-EJW",1089590400,2,1061,4.161764705882353
7047,5,0767809726,this is such an incredible movie.  We get to see to Oscar winning performances here.  Both great bodies strut their stuff and intensify the moments in the movie with the dramatic impersinations of the charactors.  Don't miss it!,1071014400,2,228,4.947368421052632
7048,4,0767809726,"A film that went unoticed in the 80's is a tight well acted thriller starring the incomparable Richard Gere as tough brash Chicago Cop who's on a revenge misson to the bayous of New Orleans to find his partner's killer and gets involved with a mobster's illerate mistress. Standard Script with a few good action sequences thrown in along with Gere's exceptional talent to hold the viewer's attention throughtout the entire film. Even though the viewer has been through familar territory with this type of script it is still a great movie. Memorable scene was when Gere & Bassinger are treding through the swamps handcuffed together Mouthing off to one another. First of two film this duo has done together the other film was released 6 years later in another steamy thriller ""Final Analysis""",1049414400,22,791,4.91044776119403
7049,2,0767809726,"No Mercy is one of those films that is not really that bad, but it leaves you wondering how did they get big stars to do it.  In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit, an ex-wife, and a bad rep.  So what happens to him?  Well his good natured partner (you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down.  So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story.  This will bring him to New Oreans(that whole ""fish-out-of-water"" thing), and to Kim Basinger.  Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys, bullets, cops who don't like him, swamps, crawfish, and cajons(sp?) all to a hip 80's soundtrack.
This film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it's credit it is better than there second film, Final Analysis.  However there really isn't much going on here.  The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock.  Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce's(the director) fault because they fall in and out of their accents.  I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films, like this one, he is still fun to watch.  The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears.
This film has it's momments, but they are pretty sparse.  Maybe Richard and Kim will get it right on the third try since they seem to like doing this type of film together. If you're out there looking for some steamy action you might want to look elsewhere.",1000252800,5,1664,4.298076923076923
7050,5,0767809726,"Great action flick about a cop out for revenge over his partner's death. Fantastic Louisiana swamps, explosive action, cheesy dialogue and of course Kim Basinger getting wet. She was a hottie in this film. Need I say more?",950140800,7,222,4.868421052631579

7053,4,0767809726,"The Pre-Katrina scenery of  New Orleans  and of the bayou makes this a worthwhile movie to watch for the aesthetic.  The plot is believable but the chemistry of  Richard Gere and Kim Basinger's connection is a tad odd.  What does occur to me is that Gere's role of saviour to Basinger,  was a glimpse of early Gere activist tendencies.  His role in ""No Mercy"" seems like one he'd enjoy playing.",1498176000,,394,4.542857142857143

7056,3,0767809726,"The initial idea is not bad but the story fails to really engage because the main character is not a moral man. He is basically a jerk who only cares about taking REVENGE for his murdered partner. It's NOT about saving a woman from slavery or protecting society from a dangerous murderer/criminal. And the attraction towards him by Kim Basinger's character is just sad - he slaps her, says nasty rude things that only an abused woman like her would be willing to overlook. Hence I don't want to root for him to get her, he does not deserve it in the slightest. As for the action part of the movie, it's OK but not great. Early on I had to cringe at a glaring faux pas of the film makers - he puts hand-cuffs on his LEFT hand and her RIGHT hand but when they get into a car she is sitting on his right side and yet he is able to drive completely unencumbered! Come on - could've made some effort to make it more realistic! Bottom line - action is ok, acting is not bad (Jeroen Krabbe is great as a villain) but the story itself does not fully engage and falls flat at the end. It's important to have a hero at the core of such a genre - think Lethal Weapon or Die Hard. The main reason we love these characters and are willing to forgive their unconventional methods is because they fight the GOOD fight and check their egos at the door. But this does not happen in ""No Mercy"".",1492128000,5,1376,4.176691729323308
7057,4,0767809726,"Definitely a film of it's genre. 1986, Miami vice was all the rage, Hunter, etc....

7059,5,0767809726,"I had purchase ""No Mercy"" for some friends, they really enjoyed this action packed movie. I have seen this movie several times and
look forward to seeing it again. Excellent action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat!",1488499200,,227,4.560975609756097
7060,4,0767809726,"This is another one of those movies I saw in the late 80's (on cable) already aware of the back story that Kim Basinger did not like working with Richard Gere and that they both were very upset about spending so much time in the movie being wet
I can see why.  There is lots of 'wet' in NO MERCY.
By the way, Gere must have been a difficult 'act' to work with because he and Debra Winger were at odds in Officer and a Gentleman, and there was a variety of production problems in Coppola'a ""The Cotton Club"" (as the story goes).  I'd assume Gere had something to do with that too.
But,
all that said, NO MERCY has a great look that begins in a pretty dreary Chicago and the gritty look does not change when locales change..
Gere is the aggressive Chicago cop who goes undercover and discovers somebody wants to hire him for a 'hit' on a no doubt about it ruthless New Orleans 'business' man with the gorgeous blonde, Cajun girl who was basically 'sold' to the 'Narlins scum by her own mother when she was 13.
Gere is always good as the wild card cop and/or loner type, and he will do just about anything to find the murder witness (Basinger).  Could she be involved more than we know?  Well, the race to the conclusion may be visible from an hour away but the ride is entertaining enough with the attractive leads in good form (Basinger really does do that ""shaking rage, so tired of being pushed around and manipulated fury"" well...).
I found the ending symbolic of a Western in ""Hell"" showdown.
Yep, not only did director Richard Pearce have his cast and crew playing in lots of water, but they also did an impressive job of playing with fire.
Keep in mind this was years before the movie Backdraft.
Street location footage and the hiding in the swamps of Louisiana footage help NO MERCY remain a credible viewing entertainment.  Some of the hard-boiled dialogue by the police Captain (George Dzundza, for example -- who is good otherwise) is too easy to laugh at:  ""I don't like you I don't wanna' swap spit ...(really?  It comes from out of no where too..) but, basically it's ""go get'tum tiger"".  Legalities have become an afterthought.
Check out NO MERCY for the good action, the real good visuals (includes Basinger's tastefully done, see through blouse when wet, of course...).
Just let some story implausibilities slide by and enjoy the buildup to Gere and Basinger's relationship and, of course, the action finale.
No need to overthink this one.  Sometimes looks are everything.  Basinger is beautiful and Gere is in the prime of his great hair days.

It was one of the best days I can remember in 1985. seated at gate 9 in the Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans with Michael Hausman, Sr., as executive producer and Dino De Laurentis, as producer, this movie stands out for action, action and more action...then there's the reactions. You'd enjoy this flick, believe dat! Richard Gere makes himself understood, right, well and real! Purchase this, you won't be sorry. And no I do not receive any royalties as an extra! Oh I'm in the airport scene, white rabbit coat, white leather heels, Levi Strauss jeans and tan suitcase, as Here exits the unmarked unit! They actually kept me in frame until I walked out of sight!

7082,5,0767809726,"""No Mercy"". A movie written and directed with an A excellence for Action, Suspense, and Romance and casted perfectly. Almost reminded me of Denzel Washingtons, ""The Equalizer"" but that was on another level, of course. I had to give this 5 stars, because 4 would be too critical for minor defects if any and too critical of minor details in the movie. The only thing I was surprised with, is that Richard Gere dyed his hair brown for the part ? No a ""Mr Jones"" it was not, that was out of part for Richard Gere's parts in movies he takes, but it was great. The Beautiful Kim Basinger showed B+ acting and Richard Gere the Hero.

Deveneux has come to Chicago specifically to find a hitman. While Jillette's partner Joe Collins (Gary Basaraba) escorts Duval back to her hotel, Jillette meets with Deveneux, but before Jillette can find out the details of the target in New Orleans, Deveneux is killed. Jillette escapes and goes to meet up with his partner, only to find that he too has been killed. Jillette's boss, Captain Sternkowski (George Dzundza) allows Jillette to go to New Orleans to hunt down Collins' killer. The villain Jillette is tracking is Losado (Jeroen Krabb). Jillette's first option is to try to find Losado through Paul Deveneux's cousin Allan (William Atherton), who resents Jillette's actions and is very protective of Duval. Jillette arrests Duval for complicity in the murder of his partner and the two of them then find themselves on the run both from Losado and from the local police chief Lieutenant Hall (Bruce McGill). This is a very exciting story and I will say only that Jillette eventually gets his man - but getting there runs into a great many difficulties.",1370476800,,1257,4.933962264150943

 Richard has to find out who killed his buddy cop.  He isn't allowed to but he finds out anyway.  He looks for Kim Basinger he only knows her from her blonde hair and tatto.  He finds her and handcuff her sexy.  It screaming S and M undertones wich is sexy!!!
Its a must for Richard Gere fans both male and female.",1292371200,,568,4.1
7157,4,0767809726,"Released in late 1986, ""No Mercy"" stars Richard Gere as a Chicago cop who travels to New Orleans to track down a blond (Kim Basinger) who is linked to the murderer of his beloved partner. The film features a great love-to-hate villain, Losado, played by Jeroen Krabb; a notable survival-in-the-swamp sequence wherein Gere & Basinger are handcuffed to eachother; and an action-packed showdown in an old city hotel.

Actually, I could do without the hotel showdown, as it comes off too cartooney and contrived (like when one of the villains barges right through a wall with his rifle -- Why sure!), but I suppose it can be accepted on the grounds of Western-like artistic license.

There's loads of foul language but I found it realistic for these types of individuals in such critical situations. So I didn't mind it too much but my wife took (minor) offense.

Gere's still relatively young here (36). I realize many hate him, but I'm a fan of quite a few of his pictures, e.g. ""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""King David"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Kim Basinger doesn't do much for me personally, although she's certainly pretty and her acting is effective here. I know it's a matter of taste but ""No Mercy"" provides zero 'babe appeal' for me.

The film was shot in Chicago and Louisiana (and some parts in NC).

The score is moving despite the dated mid-80s electronic drums.

FINAL WORD: It's hard to put into words why I like this film to the extent of writing a review. It's nothing exceptional, but it somehow 'works' and gets better with repeat viewings. I bought the dvd a year & a half ago and have watched it three times since, which is something I rarely (if ever) do. I think what attracts me is that it's more than just a mindless cop/action flick, although it has the thrills if that's all you're looking for. ""No Mercy"" has something to say about love, loyalty, courage, justice, freedom and happiness, but it's smart enough to not spell it all out. Hence, not only is the picture enjoyable to watch due to the 'movie  magic' but it can also leave you contemplating.

The film runs 106 minutes.

7159,4,0767809726,"When this movie first came out it was a perfect rainy day date movie.  Well, it still is.  Cameo performances from a very young Jeroen Krabbe, as well as Kim Basinger make this a real collectors item.  Atmospheric, moody, not the greatest script, but hey the visuals rock it.

The result is that both the guy and Jillette's partner wind up very dead, while a stunning blonde in on the setup disappears. He heads south to settle the score and soon finds himself being hunted, with the girl in tow and the local police anything but happy. Gere and Kim Basinger go very well together, and the chemistry between them adds to the movie's realism. ""No Mercy"" in my view  is one of the better thrillers of the eighties. The action sequences, especially the final shootout in the burning flophouse, are effective enough to satisfy action movie junkies, but there is more to the movie than that. It is well acted, well photographed and well written, in all a superior sort of thriller.",1267574400,4,823,4.5608108108108105

7788762,3,0767809726,"It's about average for your 80's action movie.  Doesn't reach your ""48 hrs"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Die Hard"" or any Dirty Harry film level of crime drama cop movie.  I find some of the scenes very unbelievable drifting through a swamp all night in the everglades, with alligators and snakes all over the place, not very realistic. Trying to escape a burning building by not obviously going out the dam* window.  The poor damsel in distress standing in shock instead of helping our hero out by shooting the villain or making some effort to defend herself.  The lead villain Losado looked an awful lot like Sam Neil from Jurassic Park fame.  Must be his long lost twin or something.

I liked the locations in this film of New Orleans and thought the film did have some promise, but a lot of the film's pacing is slowed way down at times which makes it kind of a dull movie.  I found the film very forgetful and that is the worst thing you can do for an action movie.  More could have been made of the New Orleans police lack of respect for the Chicago PD.  I am sure real politics happen like that in real life as well.  There is mob connections in New Orleans similar to the mob in Chicago.  The movie ends up being overly generic instead of a riveting action suspense movie.

Overall I would rate the film about 2 1/2 stars just slightly above made for TV movie quality.  I like Richard Gere and Kim Basinger this isn't the best movie for either one of them.  Richard was much better in ""Internal Affairs"" and Kim Basinger seemed to be type cast into the same roles over and over again.",1517788800,,1582,4.391752577319588
