8321688,3,B001MT80AA,"This DVD must be a very poor copy of a much older Video. I'm giving it three stars because there's a lot of information regarding Scottish history, but the film quality is horrible, almost hard to see, and the sound quality is also very poor. I really bought this for the sections on Scotland, but tried to watch the Irish part too to see if it was better and I was giving an unfair review... nope, terrible and terribly dated as well. Think of an old (boring) film clip that you had to watch in high school and you've about got it. The background music, when I could hear it, was not offensive. And there is some beautiful, tho grainy and blurry, Scottish scenery, and a lot of history, but in my opinion, get a good book.",1421884800,,723,4.2846715328467155
