2874324,4,B000RPD0DC,"I happened to find this item on a shelf at a Circut City a week ago and it is uncensored according to the case. However i couldn't purchase the item since it wasn't supposed to be out for another 3 weeks but it was definately season 2. This season was very funny and i can't wait to purchase it. The DVD has 20 episodes on it and unfortunately the STAR WARS SPECIAL didn't appear to make it. However the Christmas Special did. I believe this was originally on season one, but not the DVD. Still a great season though, 5 star show minus 1 star for not including the special.",1187913600,2,573,4.218181818181818
2874325,3,B000RPD0DC,"Dead chicken is brought back to life by mad scientist and forced to watch bad TV shows. Short (12-minutes per episode)  TV series satirizes popular culture and network television with rapid-fire claymation vignettes.

2874327,5,B000RPD0DC,"This is great! This is the best thing I've seen Cartoon Network do. Seth Green is a warped genius. This is madness in it's purest form.

Robot Chicken is a sketch show that uses action figures and various dolls to act out scenes in stop motion animation. It's only fifteen minutes long and only airs once a week but it's great fun. It's so completely random that you have no idea what's going to happen next. Nothing is sacred. Adult Swim has a real gem with this one.

This show is fun. It's like watching a mad man play with his old childhood toys. You can't help but look as you see Seth Green's sick imagination unfold bizarre and comedic situations for several famous characters with their action figure counter parts. Various celebrities lend their voices. I hope this show lasts a good long while.",1186704000,4,804,4.537931034482758

2874423,4,B000RPD0DC,You can't do that on television??? Robot chicken does. For us adults with ADHD this is a perfect dvd. Random parody clips from the late 80's early 90s. Perfect for us 20+ year olds that don't want to let go of our youth. Rock on Seth Green.,1235433600,2,240,4.127659574468085
2874424,4,B000RPD0DC,"I stumbled upon Robot Chicken late one night while flipping through channels. I've been hooked ever since. I didn't see much of this season before I bought it and the main reason I bought it was for the Star Wars sketch when the Emperor gets a phone call from Darth Vader. That bit pretty much sums up everything about Robot Chicken for me. Clever takes on ""what if"" scenarios from popular cultural items. I love that it picks on a lot of the stuff I grew up with. I'll admit that Robot Chicken isn't for everyone, but I find it hilarious. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the Star Wars DVD was funnier and that's the barometer I compare all Robot Chicken stuff to.",1232496000,,673,4.307086614173229
2874425,5,B000RPD0DC,Fast Shipping. Item was exactly as described.  Original Dvd with original case and artwork.  Thanks!!,1232323200,,101,5.666666666666667
2874426,5,B000RPD0DC,"This has to be one of the funniest shows on TV that is animated, it certainly gives South Park a run for it's money!  The first compilation was hilarious but season 2 is even funnier if that's possible.  Some of the ""skits"" are toilet humor but if you don't like one skit you'll love the next one in a few seconds.  None of them really run more than about 3 mins or so.

The Xmas special has to be seen to be believed and there is just so much material on this DVD that it will take you a while to get through it all.  If you want to laugh your brains out and don't want to have to deal with bleeps on the F bombs this is the ultimate Robot Chicken.

I mean who can not laugh at Santa complaining about breaking his ""MF"" knees and then launching into an obscenity filled diatribe.  I laughed so hard at this one show that I could hardly breath.  There is so much material on these discs (10 Episodes per disc) + bonus material and dialogue during each episode explaining the gags with the entire writing team.

This is a must see for people that like rude, adult comedy.  This is definitely not for kids and if the Cartoon Network version has you repelled you will not want to watch this, but if you've always wondered what was under all of those bleeps this is the way to go!  It's truly hilarious!",1231804800,,1299,4.156
2874427,5,B000RPD0DC,Robot Chicken - Season Two is funny. I like it a lot. It is very funny. I watch it on TV sometimes on Cartoon Network. It will make you laugh so you should watch it.,1227139200,,165,3.742857142857143

2874430,4,B000RPD0DC,"First of all, I absolutely love Robot Chicken.

However, the Season 2 DVD set let me down in one way: the only option was uncensored. I found myself not laughing as much. I'm not sure why exactly, but I at least find the censored version to be more entertaining. Hearing the bleeps instead of the words makes me laugh more for some reason. For making uncensored the only option, I had to take away a star, which is a sad thing for me.

Just a little more explanation: It would have been nice if there were a way to have some sort of setting to turn the bleeps on or off, that way those who prefer it uncensored have it and those who prefer it censored have it as well. I can't imagine it would be THAT hard.

That should not stop you from enjoying this though. For any Robot Chicken fan, this is really great to have. More of the greatness from Season 1, and something I have watched many times and will watch many times in the future.",1225497600,,935,4.183333333333334
2874431,3,B000RPD0DC,"i think this was hilarious.alot funnier than season 1. the fact that it was unrated made it a little funnier.my favorite skit from the whole season and series probably was the star wars skit. that was so freakin funny.

this dvd is one of my favorites. i put it up there with some aqua teen episodes. i think seth green is a creative genius. i could set there and wath the whole thing.

if u get this dvd you really would get your moneys worth.",1217462400,,444,4.211764705882353

It is so funny becuase its so fast paced, joke joke joke. they make sure they do the best work even if its a 15 min show.  I was totally hooked and bought both seasons after just seeing 1 eposode!",1217462400,,374,4.04054054054054
2874433,5,B000RPD0DC,"As a HUGE Robot Chicken fan, I can't recommend Vol 2 enough.

2874435,3,B000RPD0DC,I watched a couple of episodes on TV... and laughed a lot.. decided to get the CD... watched it for a while... laughed a little... but really think this cd should be watched with a group of people... some of it is funny..  some not so funny... I feel that I could have spent my money elsewhere for better value..,1216080000,,312,4.2
2874436,5,B000RPD0DC,"This is definitely an Adult Swim TV DVD I can recommend to buy and watch on DVD for three reasons - One, some of the skits run by fast (sometimes whole 11-minute episodes) that you are going to want to stop and pause or rewind and look again.  Two, on DVD the show is uncensored, mostly for language, which adds to the laughs.  Three, you can now watch the episodes continuously, which adds to the entertainment.
There is a fairly wide variety of satire with these skits and a lot of them (some only a couple of seconds long) so you are not going to laugh at all of them, but I found the majority funny.
As far as comparing season one to two, I would definitely watch one first, though there are only a few running gags through the season.  Two seems a little better on animation, but one is a little fresher on skit plots.  From what I have seen with the third season, it also looks like a winner.  If you like Seth Green's brand of rapid-fire, irreverent humor, this is a DVD to get.",1211587200,,985,4.218085106382978

2874467,5,B000RPD0DC,"Robot Chicken Season 2 is probably the best one yet, uncensored sketches, truly truly halarious without sensors like ""Buck Rogers"" and ""DragonBallZ Christmas"" also ""Molar:Ethernian Dentist"" very funny. No bleeps (exept maybe a few but its for the sake of the joke). Unfortunately, one part of the DVD got me very dissapointed, only one biig sketch was cut out of the DVD, the sketch where Archie and the Gang combine with Final Destination, one of my favorite sketches and it might of been for funny uncensored, sadly to my misfortune, they cut it out. But other than that very funny TV show and one of my favorites and my friends and I can't get enough of watching this DVD over and over and over again, it never gets old and I would love to put it on my iPod for travel or my PSP whichever I can show to people who have never watched the show before.

2874484,5,B000RPD0DC,"this is, in my opinion, one of the best tv shows to date.

seth green is an awesome director, the comentary is good, best of all you don't have to see the first season to know whats going on.

channel flips work well to segway between clips (because they usually have nothing to do with each other), this is like when using an old dial tv where the white noise shows for a fraction of a second.

the first season left little room for improvement, but the sets look better, and the box looks awesome. the only problem is that the star wars robot chicken episodics are not included.",1191974400,,580,4.302752293577981

2874488,5,B000RPD0DC,"Robot Chicken is the creation of Seth Green, the little guy that played the son of Dr Evil on the Austin Powers Movies and also provides the voice of Chris on the Family Guy cartoons. Part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim these short sketches are nothing short of comedic genius. From G.I. Joe parodies which is my favorite one, to Calvin and Hobbes they dabble in a little bit of everything from past and present pop culture. If you have not been tuning in to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and you are a fan of Family Guy Cartoons and Sick and Funny Animated Shorts, then buy this DVD and you will not regret it.",1191715200,,611,4.368421052631579
2874489,5,B000RPD0DC,"If you like cartoon comedies that are like the Simpsons and Family Guy, then this is right up your alley.  A must have of adult cartoon comedy shows.  Seth Green is a genius at work in this creation.  You will laugh until you cry.  Can't wait for more episodes.",1191542400,3,261,4.26530612244898
2874490,4,B000RPD0DC,Great DVD set for Adult humor.  These will be considered classics in the future.  The DVD's are great quality and but wish that they could have a break from the opening sequences and just play the skits that way they can get more on a single DVD that way.,1191456000,4,255,4.183673469387755
2874491,5,B000RPD0DC,"If you're a fan of completely irreverent, bizarre and random humor...this is the show for you.

Toys from yesteryear find new and twisted life in the show with insanely hilarious results. Thundercats, GIJoe, Care Bears, My Little Pony...nothing's sacred...

Also, check out the deleted scenes for the lost but still funny episodes. 5 out of 5 stars!",1191456000,,349,5.105263157894737
2874502,5,B000RPD0DC,I think this is super funny. I love this stuff. Of course the banging robot is my favorite of the little bits. Its a good time.,1191369600,,127,3.923076923076923
2874503,5,B000RPD0DC,Either your a fan of Robot Chicken or your not. This 2nd season is every bit as hilarious as the first. Seth Green's best work. Probably the most underrated comedy ever produced.,1191283200,2,178,4.59375
2874504,5,B000RPD0DC,"I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at stop-motion animation in all my life. Seeing the stop motion makes me think of having to watch the davey and goliath cartoon as a kid, and then with RC being so twisted, it all adds up to some funny stuff. I highly reccommend this for your DVD collection.",1191196800,2,298,4.245614035087719

2874506,5,B000RPD0DC,There is really nothing new to say about the second season of Robot Chicken. The same 10 minute episodes of nothing but bashing pop culture by using the most unappreicated people in show business with all the vulgarity and disturbing images this show has to offer from brain child Seth Green. Who could ask for anything more?! Wait....uncensored you say?....I'LL TAKE IT! What seals the deal in this compliation of episodes is the infamous Star Wars: Phone Call. You will wet your pants from laughing so hard and then you will wet your pants a second time because like the fool you are you just had to watch it again instantaniously. You have been warned.,1189900800,,655,4.7043478260869565
2874507,5,B000RPD0DC,This set is the best. You get this set and you won't be disappointed. If you thought this season was funny on TV you will love all of the uncensored footage here. I give it 5 stars all the way....,1189468800,,196,3.925
2874508,4,B000RPD0DC,"While the shows are short, its still packs alot of laughs. I did notice a few curse words are censored but that really didn't bother me. I still love the show. I recommend this show to people who would enjoy a random, fast paced show with a warped sense of humor.",1189382400,4,263,4.176470588235294
2874509,5,B000RPD0DC,"I can't say enough for this series!  I laughed so hard at the 'Star Wars' parodies, I gave myself an asthma attack!  Seriously, it brings to mind the scorching, dead on satire of Mad and National Lampoon magazines in the '60's and '70's, such as the Barbie and Ken reality photoplays.  RB's creators have given us a brilliant variation on the art of social as well as political satire.  The flight-suited George Bush doll says it all. And, all the while you watch this, no matter how good the writing or the artwork, you still see in the back of your mind a bunch of grown men playing with their 'collectable' toys.  And that's what makes Robot Chicken such a hit!",1188864000,2,664,4.454545454545454
2874510,5,B000RPD0DC,"The second season of Robot Chicken, created by geek-god Seth Green, continues the stop motion, action figure starring insanity that made the groundbreaking first season of the show so entertaining.  If you enjoyed the first season of the show, you should know what to expect here: skits ranging from Star Wars to classic TV shows and cartoons, to politically charged moments, celebrity-aimed knocks, to just plain blink and you miss it insanity.  However, there are some misses to this season, including a segment starring both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman as themselves, which is almost painful to watch.  The good however, greatly outweighs the bad, as we see a crazed Ted Turner (not voiced by himself) masquerade around as Captain Planet, Barney the purple dinosaur looking for love, Castro playing ""Dance, Dance, Revolution"", a fantastic Highlander spoof starring the current day teen queens, and plenty, plenty more to boot.  Also like the first season of the show, there is a horde of voice talent to be found with the second season of Robot Chicken, including Green, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Scarlet Johansson, Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd, David Hasselhoff, Seth MacFarlane, Christian Slater, Phyllis Diller, Breckin Meyer, Miguel Ferrer, Dana ""Master Shake"" Snyder, Dan Milano, Alex Borstein, Mila Kunis, Michelle Trachtenberg, Ginnifer Goodwin, Macaulay Culkin, Bruce Campbell, Peter Gallagher, Emma Caulfield, Melanie Griffith, Gene Simmons, Jimmy Kimmel, Sarah Silverman, Weird Al, Kelly Hu, Roddy Piper, and Hulk Hogan.  There's a great selection of special features to be found on this two disc set, and yes, like it says on the cover, season two of Robot Chicken is uncensored, and even funnier than you may think it would be without the bleeps.  All in all, even for casual Adult Swim viewers, season two of Robot Chicken is a must own.",1188864000,24,1849,5.2087542087542085
2874511,3,B000RPD0DC,"The Archie sketch is deleted from the ""Veggies for Sloth"" episode. Yep, another sketch gone because of legal trouble, just like the Teen Titans sketch from season 1. Also, some of the episodes still have bleeps in them, and are not truly uncensored like the box says. Other than that, the dvd is good.",1188777600,22,301,4.592592592592593
