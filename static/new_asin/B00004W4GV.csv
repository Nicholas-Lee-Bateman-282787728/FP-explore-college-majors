1360972,5,B00004W4GV,"This was a truly fantastic movie that had the entire audience in my theater laughing.  After the film ended, everyone left with a smile on their face and (literally) dancing in their steps.
I sat down to see it after a long, frustrating day.  Almost immediately, this film made me feel wonderful.  It is lighthearted, romantic (even somewhat sensual) and engaging.  Such a surprise for a Branagh film!!
Tremendously approachable Shakespeare, without cheapening the product.  The film takes a truly creative and fresh-air approach that allows the audience to get over the (huge) intellectual obstacles of Alicia Silverstone performing Shakespeare AND singing.  Choices of music are inspired and uplifting, particularly ""Let's Face the Music,"" ""Heaven"" and ""They Can't Take That Away From Me.""",975024000,5,791,5.390243902439025
1360973,1,B00004W4GV,"Kenneth Branagh's ""Love's Lobour's Lost"" has to be one of the worst Shakespeare films I've seen. It is hard to say that about something the master of Shakespeare on the screen did. Everything about this production is cheap and dull. In the movie theater I didn't know weather to: A. fall asleep, B.Walk out or C. Write Branagh and challenge him to a duel.
The first fault of this film is the acting. Once again actors doing a Shakespeare comedy feel like they have to act over-the-top stupid especially the fool which in this production wins the prize. Even Branagh acts like a fool. Even Nathan Lane who I thought would win the show is pretty dull here! As an Actor, I don't even critique films that strong as I could for acting but even someone who isn't an actor could see the ugh there's no word to describe how bad the acting was. I am certain no one knew what they were saying either which is the biggest flaw of acting Shakespeare. I would've rather see Community Theater do ""The Complete Works Of Shakespeare Abridged"" which is my most hated play of all time keep in mind.
The musical and dancing part of the movie is even worst than the acting. The music is off-key and unaspiring. The dance movements could've been done by anyone. It was all regular musical formula watered down to make it look like a read through.
Kenneth Branagh will have to do something way way better to excuse himself from this piece. It's hard to believe the same man who did amazing versions of ""Henry 5"" and ""Hamlet"" stooped to the depths of this mess of a film. In my mind, this will remain the ""Battlefield Earth"" of Shakespeare films. Save yourself the misery and pass!",974851200,13,1658,4.493377483443709
1360974,5,B00004W4GV,"Shakespeare at his lightest meets the old standards of musical  comedy and vaudeville. This movie is an absolute hoot! Yes, it's Shakespeare, but it doesn't take itself seriously at all. The entire movie is suffused with the dignity of the Marx Brothers. The storyline about a young king and his faithful courtiers who renounce women for their studies is set in the period leading up to World War II. Unfortunately for the king and his reluctant companions, women are on their way and can't be avoided. And the women are fully determined to seduce our heros and make them pay for avoiding them.
In addition to the main plot, there is a silly sub-plot about a woman who attempts to sneak into the domain of the king to meet her lover Don Armado (a character that could have been created by Monty Python) This sub-plot comes straight out of vaudeville complete with rubber chickens and mis-directed letters.
The settings are beautiful and the attention to detail is remarkable. Even the martinis are color-coordinated! The use of fake 30s newsreel footage is wonderful.
If you like slapstick and broad humor, you must see this movie. If you like musical comedies, you must see this movie. If you have always wondered what would happen if Shakespeare had been able to cast Esther Williams in his productions, you must see this movie. It successfully blends the pomp and prose of Shakespeare with the music of George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and Irving Berlin.",972950400,11,1466,4.840637450199203

Good performance by the cast especially Branagh, McElhone and Silverstone, who is much better than everybody would have suspected. She has a great skill for comedy and is perfect when things need to get serious. The movie is very beautifully designed. Great costumes (the motive of the four colors is through the entire movie) and great set pieced reminding you of the old musicals.

1360976,4,B00004W4GV,"Love's Labour's Lost is true to the spirit of Shakespeare's comedy if not the text itself.  A delightfully entertaining blend of Gershwin, Porter, and a little bit of the Bard, LLL is highly recommended for musical theatre lovers and anyone willing to consider Renaissance theatre in ways not involving pantaloons and talking to skulls. Nathan Lane is brilliant as Costard, here interpreted as a struggling vaudevillian; Lane lends vocal support (the weakest area of the cast) to the eleven o'clock number ""There's No Business Like Show Business.""  Though the ensemble struggles through some of the musical numbers, the bittersweet ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" is all the more moving because of their difficulties.  The only number which seems not to fit within the framework of the play/musical/film is also its chief selling point; LLL publicity has focused upon the Fosse-esque ""Let's Face the Music and Dance,"" which stands out in an otherwise charmingly coquettish production as a sexually charged sore thumb. As always, theatricality dominates Branagh's directorial style; look for long, sweeping shots and entire scenes filmed with a single camera and no cut-aways.  Though many critics lambasted Branagh for cutting well over half of Shakespeare's text, the musical interludes fulfill much of the function of the missing lines in a way that is a dead-on throwback to an earlier generation of entertainment.",971395200,36,1421,5.302222222222222

1361002,5,B00004W4GV,"I did not know what to make of this movie. First rate casting, beautiful colorful cinematography. A Shakespeare farce or comedy brought into collision with the silly and wonderful musicals of the thirties it has to be the most creative movie I have ever seen! It had me smiling and laughing all the way through, the music was performed just as it would have been in the thirties from Esther Waters synchronized swimmers in period gold bathing suits and caps, to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers with beautiful dresses and Tuxedos! Light comedy and gags. Even summaries given in period newsreel format. Turn on the captioning so you do not miss the fast paced lines of Shakespeare, and to see the lyrics too. Some could criticize editing of the original Script but the production it made for a modern audience. I found it to be one of the most creative and entertaining movies I have ever seen. What do critics know? They have their opinion, and not all the reviews were bad. Judge this film by how you feel watching it it distracts you with surprises, delights you with smiles and laughter, soon you forget all your troubles and are feeling wonderful all through it.

1361006,4,B00004W4GV,"I have not read this play or seen a production aside from this movie, but it definitely follows the wacky antics in plays like Much Ado About Nothing. The King of Navarre and three friends swear a public oath to study philosophy and other esoteric subjects while foreswearing women for three years. Naturally they do this just before the French princess comes to visit with three of her lady friends who all have had past associations with the King's three friends. A lot of comedy ensues as the men try to stay with their vows but also woo their women in secret.

The twist here is the setting is a 1930s musical. In fact, the story is set in the 1930s, so World War II is looming on the horizon for all the characters. And what I presume is the role of the chorus is taken over cleverly by short black-and-white newsreels filling in the back story (much like the TV reporter at the beginning of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet). The songs are classic jazz-era tunes from Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins, etc. The singing and dancing are good but not stellar (except for a fabulous ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" by Timothy Spall's Don Armado). The cast gives fine performances, hitting the right blend of serious and silly and sensual.

The story is pretty light but very enjoyable and fits really well with a classic Hollywood musical treatment.

Parental advisory: There is one sensual dance scene with no nudity but a lot of touching. Otherwise the romantic intrigues are fairly benign.",1381881600,,1494,4.609022556390977
1361007,5,B00004W4GV,"One of the best movies of Shakepeare I have ever seen!

Some moments of comedy, and how they are staged, left us howling with laughter, literally belly-laughing.  Enough so to make our children come running, asking if we were alright!  The cast is delightful, even if some can't handle the dialoigue quite professionally.  The trick is, Branagh has decided that this would make a good 1930's Musical. !!!  So he adds songs and dances!  Using song by Cole Porter and Irving Berlin, beautifully chosen to highlight the text and bring it out.

The cast is marvelous!  Richard Briers is his classic self, Timothy Spall has a comic tour de force as Armando, and Geraldine McEwan is delightful!  But Nathan Lane about steals the show!  You've never seen him this good!

Branagh has that marvelous ability to make sure his actors bring out the text perfectly, as if we were all used to hearing this language of Shakespeare's, though it's 400 years old!  You are absolutely clear as to hwat's being said, what's happening, at all times.  A rare gift indeed!  And for comedy, indispensible.

Then the ending.  Oh my!  The end of the play by Shakespeare is unusual - and brief!  There is a  sequel mentioned in history, but we don't have it.  So Branagh, by setting it in the 1930's, gives us an ending which is beautiful, heart breakingly lovely and splendid -  it brings me to tears every time!  WIthout a word of extra text, just gorgeous music by Patrick Doyle it continues the storyline in a very unique way, and it is moving beyond compare.",1379721600,4,1536,4.652985074626866

1361019,5,B00004W4GV,"Kenneth Branagh is arguably the foremost Shakespearean actor of this age, and his Shakespeare Film Company is doing a remarkable job of bringing the Bard to the masses.  In the case of this production, he has taken a very non-traditional approach to the material (which may be unpapupar with ""purists"") and, in turning it into a musical - using some of the great music of the 30's and 40's - has made this comedy extremely accessible and entertaining for even non-Shakespeare enthusiasts.

1361039,1,B00004W4GV,"There's a line in ""Life With Father"" where the leading character protests. ""That isn't coffee.  You couldn't possible combine coffee and water and come up with that.  It's slops, that's what it is, slops.""  Well, until you see this movie, you might think, ""It isn't possible to combine a Shakespearean comedy with perfect movie songs and reasonably decent actors and come up with a stinker this bad."" But they did, chums.  It's slops that's what it is, slops.

Kenneth Branagh was still in his Gilderoy Lockhart phase when he made this one: no doubter of his own talent, he ripped bits of Shakespearean dialog along with much of the basic structure of the play to use as scaffolding for his own creation.  LLL is now pre-war Europe with costume-coordinated (so we can tell which girl goes with which boy) non-sweethearts, plus a pair of wonderful clowns (Seriously, this film is a waste of a perfectly good Nathan Lane and Timothy Spall and I don't like seeing Richard Briers put to waste either) the June Taylor dancers, an Esther Williams swimming number, some of the very best songs from Irving Berlin and Cole Porter, some channeling of Busby Berkeley and a director who didn't know when to yell ""Cut!""  If it sounds like it should have worked, well yes, except for a few problems.

The actors did their own signing and they can't sing.  I don't mean off-key, just they can't put any conviction or delivery into those voices. If you can't sing in a musical either talk-sing it into a hit like Rex Harrison, have it dubbed or don't sing at all.  Anything else is a sin.

The actors are not natural dancers and it shows.  It's clumsy at best and downright embarrassing at worst.  There are ways around it if you have a great choreographer (""All that Jazz"") and an actor who's willing to work him or herself to death to fake not being bad.  In this picture they couldn't be bothered. Of course, there are real dancers in the chorus but their performance only points out how sloppy the leads are.  Seriously sloppy.  Off-with-their-heads sloppy.  Seriously, if this film has any redeeming feature, it must be that Busby Berkeley's ghost got a great cardio work out; these numbers have him rolling in his grave.

Worst of all, some of the actors can't act.  Alicia Silverstone is fine with short choppy American dialogue but she absolutely drowns in Elizabethan verse.  She's trying her hardest but it's just past her limit here and it shows.  Much as I would like to blame this on her, I think the main blame goes to the director (Branagh) who should have seen her floundering and should have helped her or cut the film (he cut everything else!) so the disasters didn't show.  He didn't.

I am an unabashed fan of Shakespeare, musicals and several of the actors in this laundry-soap-leaves-better film, so this really hurts.  I wish I could go back 12 years and grab the director by his overly-coiffed hairs and say ""Fix this or don't release it, buddy!""  But I can't.  All I can do is warn others to avoid this pathetic production in favor of one where the singers sing, the dancers dance and the speech sparkles trippingly off the actor's tongue.  Until then, take this brew of Shakespeare/Berlin/Gershwin/Porter & Branagh and take it back to the kitchen.  It's slops is what it is, slops.",1328054400,8,3291,4.676521739130434
1361040,4,B00004W4GV,"I read both good and bad reviews of this work before saying, ""Oh, what the heck...  It's Branagh doing Shakespeare...  Take a chance...""

It's not quite up to the 5-star quality of _Henry V_.  But that was a tour de force that'd be hard to repeat.  If there were a place for 3 1/2 stars, I'd probably give it that, but I'll let the fourth one slide by on benefit of doubt.

The high points?  A novel idea, to be sure.  Reasonably good choreography given that none of the stars is really cut out for dancing.  And again, a good edit of the original work on Branagh's part.

The lows?  It was about one musical number too long.  I'm not sure which I'd have cut, but I'd have let one of them go.  I might not be saying that had anybody had a voice powerful enough to carry the tunes.  But when you know them all and you've heard them done by Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, etc., nothing done by actors who are actors first and singers second is likely to stand up.

The acting?  Again, Branagh is superb.  On her looks alone Natascha McElhone could read the phone book and I'd be at rapt attention, so it was all the more pleasant to find out that she actually could carry Shakespeare.  But Alessandro Nivola's performance was touch-and-go, and Alicia Silverstone struck me as being a little out of her depth.  Not as far out as Keanu Reeves was in _Much Ado_, which I'd drop from five stars to four on the basis of that casting blunder alone.  But as far as having a uniformly solid cast of the kind in _Henry V_, this production came up a little short.  If I could have swapped Brain Blessed and Derek Jacobi into this production in a role here or there, I'd have done it.

Was it worth the $7 I paid for a used DVD?  Well, considering the trash that regularly goes for $8 a seat at the local Cineplex, the answer would have to be an emphatic yes.  Even 3 1/2 star Shakespeare is better than five star _The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas_ (if there is such a thing).

I'd say buy it, try it, and don't feel guilty if you hit the fast forward button through one or two of the musical numbers.  If I watch it again, I almost certainly will.",1312675200,,2149,4.2444444444444445

1361045,5,B00004W4GV,"This production was my introduction to this early play by William Shakespeare.  I think my first impression was that it was a production filled with light -- everything seems very bright and beautiful.  The acting and production is superb, especially the comedy.  This is, indeed, one of Shakespeare's happiest comedies, until the dark climax intrudes.  As with most (and I think all) of these productions, dress is of the historical period.  This early play is infused with poetry, and yet the players of this superb production speak the lines, for the most part, naturally, bringing out their meaning despite the archaic language.  It is interesting to see, even at such an early date, Shakespeare makes each of his characters unique, a soul unto itself; and, too, that he was such a thorough playwright, self-assured and full of unique talent.  The characters in this play, even the fantasticks, are fascinating and believable.  Mike Gwilym (whose PERICLES in this series is an outstanding performance) is excellent in the role of Berowne.  David Warner is quite amusing as Don Armado.  Moth, perhaps a role that was originally played by a child actor, is portrayed here by the delightful John Kane, and his comic genius is as subtle as it is effective.  Paul Jesson's performance as Costard seems exactly right, amusing and down to earth.  The fantasticks of language are well-represented with John Wells especially fine as Holofernes.  Maureen Lipman's Princes of France is intelligent, witty, sexy and charming.  The play is, indeed, rather risque, and the sexual frolic of the lines is handled with expertise.  Sets are simple.  Again, one of the effects of this production is that it seems full of light -- as opposed to MACBETH, which seems almost a paean to darkness.  I love this production and have watched my old video recording of it numerous times.  It's lovely to have it on disc.  The quality is very good, the program being digitally remastered, the picture and sound enhanced.  There is a downloadable script of the play but I have yet to figure out how to do it--I am, alas, rather computer clueless.  The one thing about these BBC television productions of Shakespeare is that they are usually so well done that every live performance that I have seen of the plays here in Seattle rather suffers by comparison.  It was once my fantasy to see all of Shakespeare Live--but I find that the experience of these BBC productions is so fine that they cannot be improved upon.",1262217600,7,2489,4.904306220095694

king is well humbled in the result.
What the year and a day of penance might bring is left for us
to imagine by Shakespeare, but oath breakers were not well thought of
in this time frame. From a modern prospective the romantic love
of Shakespeare's time was hardly a practical search for a life partner
were one looks for a long term relationship. But love as a
rational behavior has always been in short supply,
and women have been the better temper of it in their
search for a wealthy man.",1258070400,2,685,4.317829457364341
1361068,3,B00004W4GV,"I was excited to see this movie because I love Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare movies.  Unlike his others, though, I haven't read this Shakespeare play.  So maybe I should have done that before I watched the movie.  Oh, well, too late.  The movie started out ok; a ton of dialogue about the vow the four men have taken and how serious it is.  But then all of a sudden, they broke into SONG!  When I realized that he turned it into a musical, I couldn't decide how I felt about it.  I think it might work if the idea was really SOLD - in other words, the actors could sing and dance really well, instead of just ok singing and dances that were obviously choreographed for people who aren't dancers.  This was not convincing.  I still can't figure out whether Branagh was trying to pay homage to a great film genre (1930s/40s movie musical) or poking gentle fun at it.  The dancing is weak, with the exception of Adrian Lester, who both sings and dances well in this film - unfortunately that just seems to emphasize how mediocre the singing and dancing of the others is.  And I have no idea why a scene from ""Chicago"" took over the movie when the song ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" came on.  It really made no sense; the rest of the film wasn't that sensual at all, and there certainly wouldn't have been dancing like that in the 1940s musicals.  To be frank, the musical numbers and dances just didn't flow naturally in each scene - they were awkward and not enjoyable enough to be excused for that awkwardness.  Perhaps it is because generally the 1930s/40s musicals paired cheesy songs with cheesy lovey-dovey dialogue, so it flowed.  Or, failing that, they used a show-within-a-show vehicle to feature the songs (think White Christmas).  Maybe this could have been successful if Boublil & Schonberg (Les Miserables) had composed more serious music for it, rather than Branagh choosing to use old standards.

I watched the film to the end, because I didn't know what actually happened in the play and wanted to know.  I'm still not sure I do know.  We got a bunch of fake news reels throughout the movie and a whole bunch at the end, which somehow were supposed to help, I am sure, but I think they fell flat and the ending was way too rushed and abrupt.  The ladies say, ""oh, we have to go so the princess can be queen now that her's father's dead - wait a year for us,"" then there's a war, the men all fight/ladies help with the war's cause; then it's over and they are together, yippee!  I don't feel like we had enough time to see the characters fall in love for real, so I didn't really care whether they got together in the end or not.  And I'm sorry, but Alicia just didn't work in that princess role.  She was the Keanu Reeves of the production (although not as bad as he was in Much Ado - shudder).  It was very hard to get over her pronunciation and ""acting"".  I also couldn't figure out what the point was of the following characters: the Spaniard, the country lass, Nathan Lane's character, the constable, the professor, and the reverend.  I know they are in the play; but they didn't seem to have a connection to the other characters here, and I certainly couldn't understand what was going on between them.  The funniest scene (at least I hope it was supposed to be funny) was when the country lass, the prof., the reverend, the constable, etc. were ""dancing"" - I put it in quotes because I'm not sure I'd call it that.  What I did like: the costumes, the scenery.  A little bit of the acting, maybe some of Branagh's lines.  But even Branagh has a speech in the library which seems acted/spoken in an identical way to his soliloquy in Much Ado where he's describing the kind of woman he wants, which I found disappointing and it made me think less of him as an actor.

Watch this movie if you want to see how strange it is.  I gave it three stars because it's not as though the source material is bad, and I won't throw up if I have to watch it again.  It's worth a once-through if you like Shakespeare and musicals.  It probably could have been so much better, though.",1253664000,3,4087,4.405333333333333
1361069,4,B00004W4GV,Although this production leaves the ground (literally in one scene) of the text it is a beautiful and delighfully silly film. Love's Labour Lost is a play of wit which delighted Elizabeth's court but demands much of a modern reader/playgoer... but rewards are there for the persistant. Branagh offers a sweetener if you haven't read it.,1247011200,,336,5.017857142857143
1361070,3,B00004W4GV,"""Love's Labour's Lost"" is an entertaining mash-up of a 1930's era musical with one of Shakespeare's slighter comedies. The combination is less seamless than one might have wished, but Kenneth Branagh and his photogenic cast coast on creamy charm. This flighty flick has all the nutritional value of a flute of champagne, but who says Shakespeare has to be good for you? After Branagh's epic, unabridged ""Hamlet""--a four course meal if ever there was one--no one can blame him for whipping up this frothy dessert.

The fact that ""LLL"" is relatively unknown Shakespeare gives Branagh license to play fast and loose with his source material. This adaptation doesn't labor under the false pretense that it is anything more than it is - an old fashioned paean to old-fashioned movie musicals. Branagh sets the film in a Technicolor dreamscape that deliberately echoes the great musicals of yesteryear. The soundtrack features hummable hits by the likes of Irving Berlin, Gershwin, and Cole Porter, and the movie itself is a wholehearted embrace of old-school glamour: dapper tuxedoes, filtered cigarettes, chic hairdos, Busby-Berkeley water theatrics, and some burlesque-inspired broad comedy are all welcome throwbacks to a more stylish era.

A movie this bubbly and good-natured would be tough for even the most hardened cynic to resist. So call me a cynic, but for all its breezy charm ""LLL"" never quite hits the high notes of Branagh's first cinematic foray into Shakespeare comedy, ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (1993). Gussying up one of the Bard's less-produced plays as a retro musical was a nifty idea, but the movie never quite lives up to the promise of its cutesy conceit.

Part of the problem is that the cast's singing and dancing skills are not exactly up to snuff. The shaggy-dog amateurishness of the dance numbers adds to the movie's ""let's put on a show!"" charm, but any comparisons to Ginger Rogers or Fred Astaire would be downright insulting. (Adrian Lester excepted -- this incredible talent sings, dances, and performs ""Hamlet"" like he was born for the part. What can't he do?) The choreography is modest enough to not embarrass the untrained actors' equally modest abilities, and the occasionally off-key renderings of Broadway standards also have an oddly appealing quality. Nonetheless, this is a musical, after all, and the slipshod singing and dancing give the impression that Branagh slapped the production together in a manic fit of inspiration and didn't have the time or the resources to smooth out the rough patches.

Branagh enthusiasts (and I count myself among them) will get a kick out of the singing, dancing, and Bard-penned bantering. ""LLL"" is so light, it practically vanishes. Yet even if you can't remember exactly what transpired as the credits roll, you'll probably have a couple of catchy showtunes swimming in your head and a warm sense of soft-focus nostalgia for bygone days. There are worse ways to spend an evening.",1235865600,3,2957,5.103305785123967
1361071,3,B00004W4GV,"Wild horses couldn't get most of us to watch a full-length Shakespeare play starring Alicia Silverstone, but give the girl credit for really trying!  (I do like the review below in which the reviewer criticizes Silverstone for speaking her dialogue with emphasis on every single word, it's true.)  So even while I take off two stars for the terrible performance she gives, I add two stars because I think she's so great.  What!  A paradox worthy of the great Matthew Lillard.  In any case she looks enchanting and her expressions in the cafe scenes with her girlfriends, as she glances from face to face, often seeming to anticipate who will be speaking next, give the viewer the feeling of being a pinball in a mighty pinball machine of the late 16th century.  She must have been studying, or Branagh must have been feeding her, videotapes of old Cybill Shepherd movies like DAISY MILLER and AT LONG LAST LOVE to get everything that disastrously wrong on a syllable level...  and yet the movie would be pretty dull without her.

Kenneth Branagh, why so many long, long long shots of the musical numbers like the one in ""I've Got a Crush on You?""  Is it to reassure us that the actors you picked are actually doing the dancing?  Maybe so, for in the one number (the sexy ""Let's Face the Music and Dance,"" in which all the stars wear elaborate masks) that uses extremely swift cuts and closeups of miscellaneous body parts a la FLASHDANCE, I was soon convinced that the real actors were participating only occasionally, and that you had hired Ann Reinking or whoever to play their body doubles for the Fosse-like choreography.  I see that you persuaded Stanley Donen (and Martin Scorcese) to sign on as ""presenters,"" whatever that means, but in those long static shots of Geraldine McEwan cavorting for ten minutes at a stretch along a green sward, you are displaying the Donen touch for sure.

Were you too old to play a youth in Love's Labours Lost?  Maybe so, but I watched the whole picture just thinking you were the uncle to the other boys.  Only after I went back and read the play did I see that Berowne is supposed to be no older, just a little wiser, than his three friends.  Still you're great and I'm just sorry that the failure of this movie was such a setback for your career.  But you wound up luckier than your leading lady whose career this bomb pretty much decimated.  She was for five minutes the greatest star in the world, then you came along with this, and the Batman and Robin movie came along making her look chunky and dumb, and then it was curtains for a unique talent in the cinema.",1227744000,2,2608,4.562231759656652

Nathan Lane is hilarious as well as Timothy Spall. Once again, Kenneth Branagh works wonders as a director AND actor. It's a good date movie for drama geeks (like me). :)",1201478400,,344,4.390625

HENRY V,HAMLET,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and now LOVE""S LABOUR'S LOST each lovingly and differently interpreted so that the general public may approach Shakespeare in a way that hitherto they may have not. I am such a person. I confess that I have not been a fan of Shakespeare as usually seen in Shakespeare Festivals,Broadway and regional theatres. For me,I have no affinity nor find it interesting;AHHHHH,but thank you Kenneth Branagh for trusting your own sensibilities to continue to reinterpret these masterfully written plays so that certain of us may find Shakespeare more to our tastes. I make no apologies for what some may consider my low-brow approach to Shakespeare via Branagh;IT WORKS FOR ME and I love every last delicious minute of it!
The story to LLL is quite simple: four chums have sworn off women and frivolity for a three year period in order to pursue knowledge and enlightenment. When four gorgeous maidens arrive from France,though, the four chums find it harder and harder to keep their vows. Branagh sets this farce in 1939 Europe just before France is invaded. He styles it with the look and extravagant grandeur of a Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical with dancing and singing to the melodies of the times from Cole Porter and Irving Berlin and voila...with sharp editing,lighting and dazzling camera work,Branagh transform this Shakespeare play into a WW2 movie musical spectacle. He obviously researched the times well,for the look of Branagh's film is totally faithful to the time period including authentically recreated newsreels and swirling newspaper flashes. It is delightful from the opening scenes of the four chums taking their united vows to the semi-sweet conclusion of the end of the War. Adrian Lester is to be especially commended for his performance. I had seen him live on stage in London in the musical COMPANY and the man can sing and dance!!! The others at times seem obviously out of their elements as singers and dancers,but that is why it IS so good. This is a group of actors first and foremost who happen to be able to sing and dance;not a group of singers and dancers who can't act! BRILLIANT KENNETH.I LOVE ALL YOUR WORK.
As usual,Branagh has Patrick Doyle do his soundtrack. This pairing always works and pleases. Very highly recommended.",1192060800,,2504,5.0071942446043165
1361075,3,B00004W4GV,"Taken by its parts, this film has very little to recommend it.  The decision to cast a musical with actors who can neither sing nor dance is daring to say the least.  Dropping a Shakespearean comedy into a 30s-homage is questionable.

However, I do LOVE this movie.  It reaches that very precious stage of bad where it really starts to work.  The colors, the filming...bad dancing and poor singing...it feels like this world Branagh has thrown together is teetering on a precipice waiting to fall (which, in fact, it is).  It's bad in all the right ways for a rainy, saturday afternoon.

If you are looking for a serious WS-rendition, try Henry V or Hamlet (if it ever comes out on dvd).  If you are looking for a well-executed comedy try Much Ado, but if you are looking for something different just for the guilty pleasure of it, give Loves Labours a go.",1176681600,3,856,4.549019607843137

Four hours of archaic puns is something I've only been able to sit entirely through once at the theater, despite the company's strong performance.  This adoption makes the play ""work.""

Whatever its flaws are (e.g. Silverston's acting and Branagh's singing) I think that they are largely compensated by the enthusiasm and love that actors and director have put in making this film.  I really loved it in spite of the fact that I am not a fan of Branagh at all.  The last minutes are really moving and beautiful, they convey a sort of nostalgic feeling that seems to pervade the whole film but that is more evident at the final scenes.",1162339200,6,507,4.43010752688172
1361098,5,B00004W4GV,"I'm really of two (or three) minds about this film. LLL is a great play. I would have prefered a straight-forward movie keeping the text intact. With the failure of this movie at the box office and critically, it's unlikely I'll ever see a cinematic return to this play in my lifetime. (I am aware of the BBC version from 1985, but that is quite cut up, too.)

That said, I do enjoy this movie for what it is. The women are beautiful (especially Natascha McElhone). Timothy Spall is a great Armado, even if his part is hacked to pieces. Branagh's handling of the scene where the men are overheard professing their loves (4.3) is excellent. The deleted scene of the Nine Worthies is quite good, and would have been a much better choice for the film proper than that goddawful ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" number.

Which brings me to the songs and the dancing. I really enjoyed ""I Won't Dance"" and ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" but most of the other performances just weren't as good. Not good enough to justify the cutting of Armado's part! The familiarity of the songs didn't really help it, either. New songs in the style of Gershwin would have been a nice, albeit more difficult, choice.

So, all in all, I'm glad I bought it. I'll watch it here and there, but I'm glad I have the (unabridged) Arkangel Audio tape to turn to when I need a shot of Love's Labour's Lost. Which I need more often than you might think.",1158192000,2,1435,4.448669201520913
1361099,3,B00004W4GV,"I really love Branagh's idea of turning ""Love's Labor's Lost"" into a musical, but it just wasn't that good. Every Branagh production has an ""ouch"" casting, and this time it was Alicia Silverstone, though not as bad as Keaneau Reeve's ""Don John,"" she made a much better ""Clueless"" teenager, as she seemed uncomfortable with the language. Second, I think the biggest thing that detracted from this production was actually the way it was filmed. Everytime there was a big musical number, he pulled the camera back. I know this was harkening back to thirties productions, but the lack of solid coreography, and poorly skilled dancers made those on screen seem insignificant, and took away from the immediacy of the action. Additionally some of the song choices just didn't fit, though Lane's ""Show Business"" was brilliant. Overall, it is an average show, and would have to point people toward ""Much Ado"" first before they delve into this one.",1149120000,3,938,4.980891719745223

The last time I saw Shakespeare translated to the modern-day (Tim Blake Nelson's ""O,"" Richard Loncraine's ""Richard III,"" Baz Luhrman's ill-titled ""William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet"" and P.A.'s ""Hamlet"" starring Ethan Hawke, anyone?), I HATED it. But after reflecting briefly on Mr. Branagh's excellent track record, not to mention his convincing performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in the made-for-TV movie ""Warm Springs"" (which I haven't seen in its entirety) and looking at the star-studded cast, including Alessandro Nivola (""Mansfield Park,""), Matthew Lillard (the ""Scooby-Doo"" movies), Nathan Lane, Alcia Silverstone, Timothy Spall, previous Branagh collaborators Geraldine McEwan (""Henry V"") and Richard Clifford (""Much Ado About Nothing"") and frequent Branagh collaborator Richard Briers (""Henry V,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" ""Hamlet"") with Branagh's film composer Patrick Doyle providing original music alongside the tunes of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein II and others, I thought, ""I'll definitely give him the benefit of the doubt. He's a great actor, director, producer and screenwriter. As far as I'm concerned, he can do no wrong."" Read on.

Kenneth Branagh does it yet again. He combines Shakespeare with classic tunes from the great early 20th century composers and hilarious performances from Timothy Spall and comedian Nathan Lane. Excellent performances by everyone. The only minor disappointment is in the special features, which include 17 minutes worth of deleted scenes, sans director commentary, outtakes and a making-of featurette. Other than the absence of a director's commentary on the deleted scenes (which are well worth viewing, in conjunction with the making-of featurette and the hilarious outtakes), I'm completely satisfied with this movie. Can't wait for Branagh's next two directorial efforts: ""As You Like It,"" a remake of the classic 1937 film starring Sir Laurence Olivier, and ""The Magic Flute,"" based on the final opera of the same name by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; both set to be released next year. Rated PG for mild thematic elements.",1136419200,7,2357,5.6770538243626065

Through the years, however, I have relented and come to realize that even in Shakespeare's day plays were edited for the audience at hand, and even he prepared the script according to where and to whom it was to be shown.

Liberties have been taken in this production of Love's Labour's Lost, but they have been taken with tastefulness and knowledge by the preeminent Shakespearean actor and interpreter of our day. The production never fails to put a smile on my face; once again genius has smiled on a Branagh production. Do yourself a big favor and acquire one of these still available copies. It is out of print and not likely to be reproduced, so it is quickly becoming a rare collector's item.

A more strictly interpreted BBC version is available from Ambrose Video, and it is good. But for a rare treat that will approach your sensibilities with mirth, watch this film!",1132963200,7,1100,4.65979381443299

What might have seemed like a great idea to combine classic songs like ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" & ""The Way You Look Tonight"" and mix it with Shakespeare sinks like a stone here when mixed with WWII newsreels.  The worst part of this film is that it fizzles rather than climaxes.  About halfway through it becomes tedious and then dies as trivial.

It has pleasant moments because of a great cast.  Brannagh's soft-shoe in the library is a great piece of choreography.  Allesandro Nivola who played the psychotic brother of Nicholas Cage in ""Face/Off"" and the wild Brit rocker Ian who charms Frances MacDormand in ""Laurel Canyon"" shows his range as the King of Navarre and sings and dances terrifically.  Natasha McElhone as Rosaline is also entrancing as she was opposite Brad Pitt in ""The Devil's Own"" or with Robert DeNiro in ""Ronin.""  Timothy Spall who is one of the great character actors is funny as the mustached Don Armando.  Nathan Lane is funny.  When he falls flat on a stairwell in the deleted scenes, it's actually funnier than most of this comedy.  Matthew Lillard who usually plays creepy characters as in ""13 Ghosts"" or oddballs like in ""Scoobie Doo"" shows a side I'd never seen.  Adrien Lester as Dumaine who was great in ""Primary Colors"" and flitted briefly on the screen in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" sings and dances admirably.  Alicia Silverstone from ""Clueless"" and ""Beauty Shop"" is lovely as the Princess of France.  Unfortunately, the whole thing goes nowhere with each part more interesting than the whole.

1361104,2,B00004W4GV,"Kenneth Branagh is a rarity: a truly great stage and screen actor. And so one wonders what he is doing wasting his talents adapting, directing and starring in an (musical!) adaptation of one of Shakespeare's least-loved plays, Love's Labours Lost.

Perhaps Branagh thought that like his film adaptations of Henry V, and to a certain extent, Much Ado About Nothing, he could again dish out Shakespeare to the masses. Not in this case. I'm sure the whole cast sang really hard, and danced really hard, and gosh darn it, just gave it their all, but there's a limit. The singing, and dancing in this movie is amateurish at best. At worst, it's, well, frankly appalling. Although better choreography and less self-conscious singing may have helped matters, experienced moviegoers may wonder why in God's name Branagh wanted to stage musical numbers made famous by such virtuosos as Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. If you've seen American in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, or any of the Fred and Ginger musicals, you'll spend most of this movie cringing.

But what about Shakespeare? Does any of the Bard's poetry rise above this frothy mess of a musical? The answer to that is no, except when Branagh speaks. Then you suddenly remember that this man is one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation, perhaps of all time. But these brilliant flashes of poetry are soon drowned out by another endless musical number. I could go on, but I won't. Let it suffice to say that there is really nothing to recommend this well-intended, yet hopelessly flawed musical adaptation save one person: Kenneth Branagh. And really, in all fairness, Branagh is the man responsible for the mess. So what should you do? Rent Branagh's Henry V, or Much Ado About Nothing, or, if you must see a musical, try Singin' in the Rain or Top Hat.

I really liked the entire look of the film, from the ""all the credits at the beginning"" (just like films done before the 1970's) to the use of specific colors to for each character's costumes to changing Holofernes to Holofernia (it makes the utterances of the vicar about ""society"" mean a lot more than I thought it did when I read the play in high school).

Some reviewers complain about the presence and ""lack of ability"" of the 2 Americans in the cast. I didn't think that they did a bad job at all. Also, the fact that most of the performers are mainly actors rather than singers and dancers didn't bother me either. I prefer a good actor delivering the lines and emotions properly and dancing ""amatuerly"" than having it the other way around.

My overall favorite sequence is the ""farewell"" scene where each pair of lovers arrange to meet a year and a day hence and they sing ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" followed by a ""newsreel"" of what happens to them all during that ""year and a day"" and the reunion at the end of the film.

Additionally, my niece watched it with me and she is now reading Shakespeare's comedies, watching other films and reading about the history of the first half of the 20th century. I can't call the film a failure when it has that effect on someone.",1123286400,3,1478,4.462962962962963

 I love Branagh in any role he performs (with the exception of Dr. Frankenstein.) I loved the women who played the Queen's attendants. I loved Nathan Lane. Unfortunately, the movie just doesn't gel.

 Casting Alicia Silverstone was a misled attempt to capture a youthful audience and her delivery of iambic pentameter is clunky and paintful. She should stick to defacing Jane Austen novels.  Matthew Lillard brings a lot of energy to his role, if only he could sing or dance or deliver a line that doesn't make me want to shake my TV.

 Only one musical number is tolerable. (""Let's face the music and dance"") And that makes this movie worth watching.

 If you want to watch a Shakespeare movie, try Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" or Elizabeth Taylor's version of ""Taming of the Shrew."" Both classics.",1121040000,3,1089,4.875
1361107,4,B00004W4GV,"Okay, so this film is an acquired taste. I won't deny its enormous flaws. In order to make a 90 minute movie, with at least a third of that time devoted to musical numbers, far too much of the play is cut for it to make any sort of sense. Most of all, the fact that the actors were not trained singers or dancers or, for the most part, Shakespearean actors, shows, especially in the embarassingly amateur performances given by the two lead Americans, Alicia Silverstone and Matthew Lillard.

In spite of all this, however, I can't help but love this wacky little film. It just has such an infectious sense of joy, and such gorgeous music. No matter how much I may know, logically, that it is hopelessly flawed, I end up grinning as I watch it.

I do want to let people know, however, that there is a better alternative to this Miramax DVD. The British DVD, if you are able to play foreign discs, has much richer colors and also boasts an extremely informative and chatty commentary track by Kenneth Branagh, as well as one or two extra deleted sceens not on the American disc. It's available for about ten bucks at amazon.co.uk and is highly recommended for a fun, light Shakespeare experience.",1115942400,4,1194,4.523148148148148
1361128,5,B00004W4GV,"Set in a european neverland with a kind of drifting and pleasent lifestyle the film mirrors the original text and Europe in the 1930's with equal astuteness. The feeling of the 30's is mirrorred further by the use of classic 30's music and Hollywood musical styles, the sets have a flavour of Astaire and Rogers; as do the costumes and choreography.

 A worthy little film with a lively, engaging and romantic cast.

 To me it demonstrates Branagh is better behind the lens than infront of it.",1111795200,7,493,4.6976744186046515
1361129,4,B00004W4GV,"I agree with most of the other reviewers -  Branagh is great!  I loved his Henry V, Benedict in Much Ado, Hamlet (bummed its not on DVD!) and his Iago in Othello was pretty good although it could have been a touch more evil.  In those films he stayed quite true to the text.  While I've claimed to be a Shakespeare purist in other reviews, unlike most purists, I have to say I liked this film.

I think I get where Branagh was coming from.  He, like most Bard fans, believes Shakespeare was one of the greatest mirrors of the human condition of all time.  In this film, Branagh stays true to that aspect of Shakespeare but takes it a step further by incorporating the works of other great portrayers of the human condition, albeit musically - the great song writers of the early 20th Century.  Understood on that level, I think Branagh succeeded in blending these two mediums of commentary on love and the human condition and thereby pays homage to both in a very unique way.

If you're looking for a strict representation of Shakespeare's work, this isn't your film and there are plenty out there.  But if you're looking for a fun, whimsical, and heart-warming film that pays homage to two great artistic genres and outstanding artists, one from the 16th century and several from the 20th century, this will do the trick.",1105660800,7,1322,4.563559322033898
1361130,3,B00004W4GV,"Love's Labour's Lost is one of the rare Shakespearean films in which the viewer does not have to be a scholar to enjoy; it belongs in that category of movies which, like wine coolers, are sweet and a little intoxicating but not much else. The inclusion of details from old Hollywood musicals (including the clever placement of Fred Astaire's necktie-as-a-belt statement in the costuming) make it interesting to film buffs, and the giddy song and dance numbers make it pure cinematic confection. For once, Shakespeare's comedy is presented in a way that is actually hilarious.
The sugar rush can become overwhelming, however, especially at the end of the film, when events turn suddenly tragic and the feel-good tone receives rather desperate attempts to be maintained. Still, this version of Shakespeare is refreshing, especially after so many tragedies have already received film treatment. If anything, Love's Labour's Lost proves that interracial romance can exist in a movie without garning special attention, which is probably the most refreshing idea of all.",1066608000,7,1064,5.3017751479289945
1361131,2,B00004W4GV,"So here is my take, I love fun revisioning of Shakespeare's works so I had no problem when I heard this was being made into a musical..I even had no problem with the fact that many of the stars, including Branagh are not professional singers..no big deal there really.
What my problem was that LLL is one of the oddest of the Bards plays it is happy and comdeic for 3/4 of the play then becomes depressing at the end. IT is a VERY HARD play to do and even the slightest mistake can turn the play into a muddy mess.
Well sadly that is what we have here. The play gets mired in uncomprehensibilty very early one.
Alicia Silverstone is horrible and unconvincing as the Princess but other than that most everyone else is good but in many ways unconvincing.
Nathan Lane, who I adore, plays Costard the fool and seems very uncomfortable and unsure of just what is going on. The actor playing the Spaniard Don Armando has horrible diction and can barely be understood and he is also not terribly good, not as bad as Alicia but not great either.
And even though I didn't care at first that they were not professional signers, some of the musical numbers are such bad choices and make you cringe, at the lack any talent or how it stops the play dead, doing nothing for it. Don Armandos song was especially painful and I had to fast forward through it after awhile...
The editing is atrocious and unlike some less professional companies I have seen do this play, the ending falls completely flat, with no true revelation for the audience to really understand what this play, if done well is supposed to mean.
There are a few shinning moments, but they do not help this deeply flawed production and that is sad indeed.",1065744000,8,1707,4.456869009584665
1361132,2,B00004W4GV,"Normally I am a big fan of Kenneth Branaugh, but this just had too much singing and dancing and not enough substance. Everytime it seems that a character got a little bit heartbroken or needed to let off some ""girl"" or ""boy"" trouble steam, they suddenly turned into Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers. The part where the  men were flying in the air singing about love was almost too much for me to stomach.
I do credit Martin Scorsese for taking a relatively experimental step with Shakespeare and making it into a jazzy 30s style movie. Many directors would not take such a chance. This is a movie that is more about fun than taking itself too seriously, and if you are the type that enjoys a good musical, this might be a fun movie to take in.
I just felt it was too much musical and not enough dialogue, and by the end, I really didn't care about any of the characters.",1056326400,2,867,4.319018404907975
1361133,3,B00004W4GV,"Kenneth Brannagh started out as the modern wunderkind of Shakespearean cinema.  His early films, Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing, are both brilliant, despite some odd casting choices in the latter (Keanu Reeves).  And while I wasn't wild about his uncut, four-hour version of Hamlet, he definitely deserves credit for having the guts to film the whole thing.  So, while I was deeply skeptical about his approach to Love's Labour's Lost, I decided to give it a chance anyway.
In some ways, it worked.  It had entertaining moments, the songs were adequately executed, and the cast was more or less up to the task before them.  It is a perfectly acceptable way to spend a otherwise unoccupied afternoon.  But having watched it, I will probably never do so again.
Brannagh is both helped and hindered in this production by having chosen one of Shakespeare's lesser known plays.  The radical liberties he takes with the text (and the insertion of all those songs!) are more likely to be forgiven (or even really noticed) with this than, say, A Midsummer Night's Dream.  That also allows him to get away with the tidying of Shakespeare's rather open-ended non-ending.
But there's a reason Love's Labour's Lost is one of the lesser known plays -- namely, Shakespeare wrote much better ones.  Nothing exists in this play (or in the movie version) that isn't done better somewhere else.  If you want a Shakespearean comedy, try Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, or a Midsummer Night's Dream. (There are excellent movie versions of each.  Better yet, see one live.) If you want to see a thirties musical, try one of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodger's classics.  And if you have seen Brannagh's Benedick (in Much Ado), you have pretty much seen his Berowne, and in a better movie with a better cast.",1051488000,,1794,4.826797385620915
1361134,1,B00004W4GV,"Of all the adaptations of Shakespeare's plays for the screen, this is among the very worst. After Branagh's glorious Much Ado About Nothing, one might expect a similar treatment for this comedy. Unfortunately, this was not so. Why bother making a musical with actors and actresses who can neither sing nor dance?  Maybe this could be forgiven if the acting weren't, at best, merely adequate.",1049846400,6,391,5.015384615384615
1361135,3,B00004W4GV,"Give Kenneth Branagh credit for his gallant inventiveness and his desire to broaden the contemporary audience for Shakespeare. (He deserves someone's lifetime achievement award for his filmed Shakespeare oeuvre.) Sometimes this Love's Labour's Lost clicks beautifully, other times it misses woefully. In spirit, however, it is wholly consonant with the Bard's light, light-speed, merry-mocking, yet ultimately serious intentions. Serious, yes, because love always has a serious subtext, but Shakespeare also knows better than any who has ever lived how ridiculous love may make both lover and beloved. The broad, broad style of this production perfectly suits the material.
Moreover, Branagh + Shakespeare is always worth it. Absolutely no one has so effortlessly natural a way with any line in Shakespeare than Branagh. Ian McKellan is his match in the tragedies or the history plays, but McKellan is difficult to imagine as Benedick or Biron or Petruccio or any of Shakespeare's wiseguy comic heroes. If this were opera, Branagh would be the greatest bel canto tenor of all time. His masterful voice is on good display here, and particularly so with Biron's great speech on ""love, first learnd in a lady's eyes"" from act 4.
I am troubled hardly at all by the singing and dancing inadequacies of the cast: the ensemble numbers reminded me of high school plays - utterly amateurish but overflowing with enthusiasm. And not all lovers are singers and dancers of professional caliber. Although the cast members here are all accomplished actors, when they sing and dance, they're just you, or me, in love, hoofing for their lives and trilling their hearts out - which I count as one of the charms of the picture.
And I am also untroubled by the performances of the crowd-pleasing kids, in particular Alicia Silverstone and Matthew Illiard. Again, their broad comic approach is fine, they did what Branagh directed them to do, and they intoned the lines clearly, and in plain American (part of Branagh's charm as a director is his recognition that Shakespeare doesn't have to be declaimed by figures of marble all draped in togas: the words accept a full range of accents). Even so, not all the cast makes the cut: I thought Timothy Spall's Armado, for example, was close to grotesque - not quite appalling but, perhaps worse, unintelligible: an amusing part utterly wasted. Nathan Lane's Costard, however, amply made up for this - plus he's perfectly at home on the musical (sound)stage.
For all its splendors and creative flights, this production has difficulties that begin with Branagh's savage cut of a play that is undeservedly treated by most critics as ""minor"": it is early Shakespeare, but in its poetic abundance it is dazzlingly beautiful, filled with verbal delights and the poet's own romantic exuberance. For some odd reason, Branagh has chosen to preserve less of this than the play warrants. He could have given us a great deal more by adding a mere 15 minutes to a very brief (90 minute) film. And whither the rhetorical fencing between Biron and Rosaline? She is the great proto-Rosalind/Beatrice, and here she simply disappears along with much of Shakespeare's words.
And I also have a problem with the almost total breakdown of Branagh's original concept: the timeless examples of the Great American Songbook deployed throughout the film are simply not very well integrated into the narrative flow: they do little to advance the tale, they pop up, they recede, they're gone, they leave no trace. They could have been neatly excised, unlike the poetry and songs they replace, which I missed.
So: on balance, an honestly earned three stars for being game and entertaining, however uneven - and, frankly, for being Shakespeare on film, for which we must all be grateful. (And I must add that, over the past two months at Washington D.C.'s Folger Theater, we've had Aaron Posner's absolutely stunning production of Twelfth Night, which with vastly greater success melds a rock score to a production that uses almost all the words - and makes me think Posner got the idea from Branagh. If that's the case, those who were fortunate to experience the Folger production have additional reason to be grateful to the Great Irishman.)",1045785600,8,4239,5.057142857142857

For one thing, although Branagh handled his lines as well as usual, some of the cast's wooden delivery sounded like high school kids.  For another, the Broadway song & dance numbers were often just plain silly and not meshed well with the script and action.
""Much Ado About Nothing"" and ""Henry V"" clearly prove that with the right cast, direction, and production, Branagh can handle both lighter and heavier Shakespeare.  ""Love's Labours Lost,"" though, just doesn't work well.

1361151,5,B00004W4GV,"It may surprise you to learn this, but I don't think that Kenneth Branagh makes perfect films. He does many things brilliantly, a few things not very well, and doesn't seem to change either the good stuff or the bad from one film to the next. I therefore tend to describe his work as 'highly idiosyncratic.'
I find Branagh's ability to emulate - not simply mimic - the conventions of distinct genres one of the most potent weapons in his filmmaking arsenal. While I think 'Dead Again' illustrates this skill most effectively - I once referred to it as 'the most thrilling and effective tribute to Hitchcock this side of, well, Hitchcock' - with 'Love's Labour's Lost,' Branagh fashions a very affectionate paean to the musicals of the '40s and '50s.
This genre particularly suits his naturally sunny, optimistic and romantic (sometimes to a fault) style. In his hands, one of Shakespeare's lesser comedies - its text radically shorn - becomes a fluffy, color-coordinated musical romantic comedy, thin on plot, but long on production value and bursting with exuberance. Make no mistake about it - this musical, like its ancestors, is just often plain giddy, a bit campy and full of ridiculous coincidences and mistaken identities. Please suspend your disbelief (and check expectations of profundity) at the door.
While Branagh appropriates the right music (classics by Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins) for the film, his cast's execution of the song-and-dance numbers, by his own admission, falls short of the calibre of the performers (Astaire and Rogers in particular, but also Esther Williams [!], Gene Kelly and the like) to whom they pay tribute. It gives a cheerful, ragtag effect, more like watching a performance given by a good regional theatre troupe than by the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Though Nathan Lane (as the clownish Costard) is the only castmember with prior musical theatre experience, among the eight principal characters, one finds a mixed bag of talent ranging from passable to truly outstanding. Among the ladies, Alicia Silverstone [the Princess] has a sweet but thin voice, and often strains for notes. Carmen Ejogo [Maria] and Emily Mortimer [Katherine] fare better, but Natascha McElhone [Rosaline], with her regal bearing, Emma Thompson-ish features (I wonder whether Branagh sees that) and richer, mellow voice, outshines the other three. Among the men, Matthew Lillard [Longaville]'s skills compare to those of Silverstone; Branagh[Berowne]'s and Alessandro Nivola[the King]'s work improves upon that.
If you watch nothing else from this film, you simply must see Adrian Lester[Dumaine]'s graceful athleticism on display through his portion of 'I've Got a Crush on You.' I would guess that his homage to Gene Kelly - a hat, cartwheels, tipping chairs and all - formed the basis for his recognition as a BAFTA best actor nominee the year of this film's release. If I recall correctly, he landed a role in a stage musical not long after he finished work on 'LLL.' That should give you some idea.",1014940800,11,3033,5.129292929292929

Maybe because the reviews I read were pretty scathing.  But I was able to rent this video from my library and have to say I had a great time watching it.
Branagh and company have done an admirable job updated the story to pre-World War II; the musical numbers fit perfectly into that scenario.  It is obvious that some of the cast members are not trained in either dance or song, but that is part of the movie's charm.  Because the numbers are not polished like a Busby Berkley kaleidoscope, I think the critics missed the point.
I never would have bothered to read Shakespeare's Love Labour Lost if I had not had such a good time watching the movie.  I guess critics have a problem if a movie is an ""adaptation"" of a famous work.  Because every single word of Shakespeare's play was not used, they were offended.  But it is great fun to normal folk like myself.
One word of caution, though.  As with most movie musicals made after 1954, if you do not see the widescreen version, you are missing out.  The VHS version I first watched had 2 1/2 dancers on the screen most of the time, instead of the 4 that I knew were there.",1010448000,,1261,4.264705882352941

But I did chuckle and I did laugh!  I thought it was hilarious.  The switch in language from Elizabethan vigor (speech) to 1930s slang (music) struck me funny every time, the joke never got old, not for me.  I adored the supporting cast, all their antics amused me and a couple times I laughed so hard I disturbed the cat.  (Eventually she got up and went into another room.)  I thought the dancing was a lark and the singing, too.  A giggle, you know?  Meant for light-hearted enjoyment.

However, Kenneth Branagh has managed to make it work. By transplanting the story to the late 1930's and capturing the general mood of the play in songs from musicals of that era, he has managed to keep Shakespear's play intact, while adding the visual elements necessary in movie.
The choreography is absolutely stunning, even more so when one realises that none of the performers is a professional dancer. The songs and the text of the original work flow seemlessly into one another.
As always one of Branagh's greatest achievements is the selection of the cast, assembling an unlikely combination of actors and actresses, most whom would at first seem unsuitable to Shakespeare and to get a more then creditable preformance from this group.

I read somewhere that the black and white ""newsreel"" intros were inserted after test screening the original, because audiences couldn't decide whether they should be laughing or taking the film seriously. I could have done without the newsreel myself, but it is a minor distraction in an otherwise outrageously fun interpretation.

The two curmudgeons who disliked the film should be sentenced to see the full play produced on stage for life - because LLL was probably unintelligible even in its own day on stage (tons of in-jokes that were almost certainly dated by 1600), and is completely beyond comprehension in this. What Branagh has done is taken the goassamer elements of the plot, brightened them with some first class songs and wonderful staging (can't say dancing, because almost none of the principals can dance), done one brilliant conflation of the Bard's best lines from the play (toward the end, concerning women's eyes and the lessons to be learned from them, superb editing) and come up with a first class piece of nostalgia, barely Shakespearean, but close enough.
 So it isn't the pure stuff by a country mile. And yet one does have the feeling that Big Bill himself would have smiled and said, `he's got it exactly right.'",991526400,2,938,4.754601226993865
1361175,4,B00004W4GV,"I thought hubby was going to die during the first ten minutes of this.  At that point it was a solid romantic comedy by Shakespeare intercut with some pre WWII newsreel type footage.  I looked over at him and asked how he liked it.  ""I hate it,"" he responded.  ""Well,"" I said, ""I guess I could watch it myself tomorrow since I want to see them break out into all of those Cole Porter and Irving Berlin numbers during the midst of this Shakespearean comedy."" All of a sudden I noticed the remote had crept closer to his chest and he said, ""Let's give it another five minutes.""  I knew I had him and ,sure enough, he was laughing like mad when the burly Spainard broke into ""I Get A Kick Out Of You.""

The tale itself is slight about 4 men who want to get together with 4 women but for this vow they've made to immerse themselves in asceticism for 3 years.  That vow is easily broken.  The play is also updated to the 1930-1940s WWII Europe, which of course goes better with the music.  I think a partial debt is owed here to Woody Allen's ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" which first broke the musical into non-musical material with non-musical stars.  However, I'll take bold experimentation any way I can get it, begged, borrowed or blue!  Really, it is closer to 4.5 stars but I can't put it in quite the same 5 star class as Ethan Hawke in ""Hamlet 2000"" or Hopkins and Lange in ""Titus."" Bottom line: see it.

1361176,4,B00004W4GV,"Kenneth Branagh must have taken a leaf from Monty Python.  Every film he does could have the subtitle of ""And now for something completely different!""
That's one of the things I love about him.  He's daring and wants to experience (and wants us to experience) all sorts of moods, emotions, film genre, etc.
Love's Labour's Lost is for fun! His and ours! One review I read criticized KB for using film reversal to lengthen one of the numbers, but have you watched those movies to which he was paying homage?  That's how they did it too!  It wouldn't have been near as much fun if he'd done it ""right""!  I thought the ""Esther Williams"" bit was hysterical!
I couldn't believe it when I saw Silverstone as the princess, but she was wonderful in what had to be a huge stretch for her.  It was a stretch for all of them - and for us as viewers.  That's what made it fun and an adventure!
The music is great, the actors are beautiful and funny and sweet and the plotline is ........well, it's Shakespeare!
Don't take it seriously - Neither Shakespeare nor Branagh meant it that way!  Watch it, laugh with it, not at it and admire a man who can tear your heart out as ""Henry V"", scare you to death in ""Dead Again"", have you rolling in the aisles with ""Much Ado"", leave you in awestruck wonder as ""Hamlet"" and give you a jolly good toe-tapping time with LLL!",988502400,9,1349,4.368
1361177,4,B00004W4GV,"Like another reviewer, I too was vaguely dissatisfied on first viewing, but found the gem of enjoyment with this film comes with additional viewings.  While it may not be effortless in execution, for an all-but-dead-art-form revival it is exceptional.
Few of the tunes are out of place (the only one which, after a while, is a bit jarring is the ""Fancy Free"" segment, as it doesn't seem to flow from the set and story as much, and showcases a water-dance segment which unashamedly uses an obvious video-reversal to extend a cut.)  Most of the tunes are very well executed, and the orchaestration (especially on ""Face the Music"" and the show-stopping, tear-jerking ""Can't Take That Away From Me"") is superb.
Nathan Lane steals the scenes he is in with his impeccable comic timing (something Branagh shares with him, although he has far fewer opportunities here by virtue of the script.)  He always knows the right look, the right little gesture to put in with each line.
In short, a comic romp of a musical to be enjoyed, and not too much dissected - so I heartily recommend it to anyone open to the experience (another lost art, when the art itself is lost, is the ability of people to enjoy the art.)  For Branagh fans it is a must.  For musical fans(especially the tin-pan alley type) it is enjoyable.  For Shakespeare fans.... well, it's interesting.  For fans of all three, it's exceptional.",986083200,3,1395,4.763485477178423
1361178,5,B00004W4GV,"This film has several strong points.  First and foremost, it is FUN. It isn't a perfectly faithful recitation of the play but the Shakespearian spirit is perfect.  The plot is light and always has been, even Shakespeare didn't make this one complex. And there are no big surprises because we've known for 400 years how the story ends and Branagh didn't change that -- but he does give a little twist to the ending and there are several interesting twists and interpretations throughout including framing the story within news headlines.  And setting the story in the 1930-1940s is a great device for making the film more accessible to modern audiences, in fact, this is probably the most accessible Shakespeare film that I have ever seen. (If you like this 30's effect, try Richard III with Ian McKellen -- very different but equally good I think.)
And as if that weren't enough... The dancing and music are WONDERFUL -- I guarantee that you will be singing in your head (or out loud if you have more talent than me) when the film is over.  The song selection was full of classics that you will recognize from other settings and they were made to fit well in LLL. The dancing was beautifully choreographed and well executed.  Both the singing and dancing required really versatile actors -- this had to have been fun and challenging to do.
Lastly, the sets and costumes were stunning and effective.  The visual effect of the film is very memorable.  The use of color is especially nice.
How could it have been better?  I don't know.",986083200,4,1532,4.690298507462686
1361179,4,B00004W4GV,"As to being a fan of Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and the classic Hollywood musical, I confess both.  This acknowledged preference leaves me predisposed to enjoy this film.
And yet, on first viewing, I found myself vaguely dissatisfied.  I wasn't ""bowled over"" the same way I was by ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and ""Hamlet.""  I missed all of those great location shots and sweeping vistas.  Where were the castles?  Where was the sense of importance?
Thankfully, I gave the film a second viewing and I came to realize that ""Love's Labor's Lost"" is not only Shakespeare filmed as a 1940's Hollywood musical, but it is filmed in the style of a 1940's Hollywood musical.  All action takes place on a sound stage, and all the colors are primary.  It's not meant to look real the way ""Henry V"" looks real.  At this realization, I settled back and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I liked it even better on the third viewing when I pulled out my book and followed along with the play.  The tunes do an amazing job of capturing the missing dialog and forwarding the play.
This film has an amazing collection of tunes, with George Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin posthumously collaborating, each contributing their finest work.  While there is not a Gene Kelly among them, all of the actors are surprisingly capable triple threats.  Alessandro Nivola has a very nice voice, and Adrian Lester shows them all what dancing is during ""I've Got a Crush on You.""  Nathan Lane is great, of course, and Timothy Spall plays a very funny Don Armado (who gets to sing ""I Get a Kick Out of You"").  Natascha McElhone is a stand out among the ladies, and Alicia Silverstone is surprisingly no Keanu Reeves.
The ending of this film is the real prize.  The cast sighs their way through ""They Can't Take That Away from Me"" looking as ""Casablanca"" as they can get.  For a Shakespeare comedy, it is quite a melancholy ending.  You this way, we that way.
Finally, as the successful mark of a musical, I have been humming these tunes for weeks.  ""Take a lesson from me, I'd rather Charleston...""",983232000,11,2088,4.68956043956044
1361180,3,B00004W4GV,"No, this isn't Henry V, or Much Ado, both of which probably stand as Branagh's best movies.  But it's a lot of fun, if you can manage to relinquish a little cynicism and treat the movie as a homage to an earlier type of movie.  Plus, in my opinion, the few bits that are just *too* cheezy are easily balanced by great moments.  Branagh: ""Worthies, away; the scene begins to cloud.""  Probably a movie best suited to Branagh fans, of which I am one, or people who are buffs of old movies.  It's not for the viewer who can't let go of the present a little bit and go with the logic of the musical.",981244800,4,594,4.130434782608695
1361181,4,B00004W4GV,"The original play is sort of the ""Finnegans Wake"" of the Shakespeare canon: an avalanche of dated puns and contemporary satirical references that is going to be just about impenetrable to a modern audience. It was probably written for a very specific audience which would get all the jokes, but we, without footnotes at least as copious as the text, are simply lost. A ""straight"" production must rely heavily on that old technique of ""if we laugh hard enough, the audience will have to join in"", which can quickly grow mighty tedious. So chopping the text and story down to their bare bones, and going for slick entertainment value (as per original intent, no doubt), is probably as good a solution as any. If the effect is merely cute, that hardly represents a betrayal of the Bard, in the case of this play. One hopes, though, that Brannagh will get back to some more substantial Shakespeare at some point. The ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"" films are really interesting, agree with them wholly or not.",978912000,4,996,4.7298850574712645

Loves Labours Lost is totally unlike any other play-to-movie youve seenits wildly inventive, very sexy and so funny youll be laughing almost every minute. With its gorgeous costumes and sparking sets, it dazzles like magic, making you wish you could push the rewind button for each scene.

Co-writer Kenneth Branagh has removed all of the sometimes hard-to-understand Shakespeare verses, leaving in the famous puns and incorrigible wit. The lines that remain are not only easy to understand but delightful to hear because they are delivered by actors who have obviously worked hard and are now having entirely too much fun.

Also, and this might make The Bard turn over in his 400-year-old grave, director Branagh updated the story with grand cinematic flourishes. Its choreographed as a 1930s musical, replete with infectious tap dancing, hilarious Busby Berkley routines, awesome Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers dance-alikes and the classic music of favorite 1930s songwriters, such as as Cole Porter and Irving Berlin.

Its 1939. Though the winds of war are beginning to howl in Europe (and its important to remember that fact even if the characters dont) and the Civil War (1936 to 1939) has been tearing Spain apart, the court of Navarre resides in its happily ignorant fairy tale.

The handsome young King Ferdinand of Navarre (Boston-born Alessandro Nivola) makes his aristocratic pals vow that they will all abstain from lifes pleasures, including women, for three years while they devote their days and nights to scholarly pursuits. Longaville (lanky American Matthew Lillard) and Dumaine (Jamaican-rooted Adrian Lester) reluctantly put their pens to the oath. Berowne (Belfast-born star Kenneth Branagh) tries his eloquent best to get the King to change his mind, but he, too, eventually joins with the others.

Everything goes swell for one boring day. Then Temptation comes wafting down the river in boats that glow with swinging candle lanterns. The high-spirited Princess of France (American Alicia Silverstone, known for 1995s Clueless) arrives for a diplomatic visit with the King. She is accompanied by her ladies-in waiting: two flirty English roses Rosaline (Natascha McElhone) and Katherine (Emily Porter), and an exotic bloom named Maria (Nigerian-rooted Carmen Ejogo).

Of course, its love at first sight for all the hormonally charged 20-somethings. But being Shakespeare, things swiftly get complicated--love letters go awry, misunderstandings go ballistic, the amorous swains are driven nuts by the ladies teasing-- and lets not forget that annoying oath that keeps everyone in miserable chastity.

Again, being Shakespeare, the secondary players, the non-aristocrats, are shameless scene stealers. Theyre so hilarious youll react just as I did-- and laugh your head off. Theres the court jester Courtland (manic Broadway star Nathan Lane), whose Pan-like mischief guarantees the path to love will be paved with potholes. The pompous be-medaled bureaucrat Armado (Briton Timothy Spall) is supposed to put the wench Jaquanetta (Italian Stefania Rocca) in jail but hes so besotted with her, he cant stop chasing her all over the kingdom.

All these hijinks are played out in dance and with the ironic lyrics of the famous Depression-era love songs. Numerous classic film references, including Top Hat (1935), Singin in the Rain (1952), Annie Hall (1977) and more, ensure fun for sharp-eyed film fans. Creating tension is the use of mock newsreels, at first portraying the kingdom of Navarre as a paradise and then, as war sets in, as an all-too-real member of the reality of war. In this way Branagh, a vitally complex artist, brings in an unexpected layer of sobriety to what is usually seen as one of Shakespeares baubles.

What will happen to the world that the court of Navarre once knew? More importantly, what will happen to love?

Branaghs character, Berowne, assures us of the eternal power of the heart:

And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Make Heaven drowsy with the harmony.",1472342400,2,4111,5.251524390243903
