7949125,5,B00005OSNE,Bought this movie for my toddler after a recommendation from school. Well needless to say everyone in the house knows the songs. I guess they are pretty catchy!  We have since ordered more. Mommy and Me is a very sweet video series,1425427200,,231,4.5
7949126,5,B00005OSNE,"Mommy and Me was a great series-- until they sold to (I think)Disney. And, believe me, I'm the biggest Disney fan out there, but this time, they ruined something wonderful.

Anyways, Lullaby and Goodnight, Splish Splash, and Fun and Friends are the first three.  After that, they changed formats and casting methods and all of the series took place in an ugly daycare type room.  But, these three dvds I've just mentioned are before those drastic changes and they are phenomenal.

My daughter's favorites, in order (and my husband's and mine, too) are Lullaby and Goodnight, then Splish Splash, then Fun and Friends.  But, they are all wonderful.

Each episode takes place in a warm and cheerfully decorated home.  Lullaby and Goodnight is a slumber party, where several moms and their kids of different ages are having a sleepover.  They sing songs, brush their teeth and wash their faces and get their pajamas on.  Then they hear a story and go to sleep.  They also have a talking radio, voiced by Tim Conway (who's very likable here) and a talking silly flower voiced by Caroline Rhea.  She's good, too, but they weren't necessary because the stars of the shows are the moms.

They aren't glamorous, but they are all attractive mothers with very nice personalities and voices.  They take turns singing and speaking and do a wonderful job.  They are very professional, but seem like moms rather than actors.  Each episode has a mom that is in the spotlight more than the others, but they all take their turns.  Lullaby and Goodnight's mom  is on the front cover and she has an adorable personality-- very likable, very sweet and engaging.

Splish Splash's episode is about water play-- the stories involve water, the songs involve water and the kids play outside in the backyard pool.  The main mom here is also sweet and very upbeat-- you have to smile while watching any of these dvds.

Fun and Friends' theme is friends (as are all the others, too), and is also charming and great fun.

When my daughter watched these, she wanted to play them CONTINUALLY.  She learned how to press play on the dvd player while watching these.  Even now that she's four, she'll request one or two of them sometimes.

They are great fun and I really wish they would have made more of these dvds.  The quality is wonderful and each dvd has some extras including parental advice, etc.  Kind of boring run of the mill stuff, but I bought the dvds for the kids, not for the advice, so I'm very happy with them.",1199836800,,2493,4.660550458715596

7949128,5,B00005OSNE,"My two-year-old LOVES this video.  The three adult ""mommies"" use wonderful facial expressions and ""talking to toddler"" voices that really make it seem as if they were speaking directly to my child.  It is very well-structured instead of just singing songs one after the other.  They say ""now it's time to..."" and ""okay, next we're going to..."" and it really helps to give the video a sense of purpose.
They play toddler-appropriate games, sing engaging songs, and read a short animated fairy tale.  The three children in the video all seem to be having fun with these activities, too.  ""Splish Splash"" uses repetition, exploration and discovery, and lots of music to keep the children focused throughout the video.
The songs are familiar and well-composed.  I especially like ""Three Little Fishes"" and ""Singing in the Rain"" as I had forgotten the lyrics to these songs from my childhood.  The only thing I didn't like was the daisy-puppet.  It just looked creepy with it's eyes rolling around and it's mouth stuck in a huge rubber smile.  But my toddler doesn't seem to mind, so I guess it's just me!  If he loves it, that's all that matters!  I highly recommend this one.",1084924800,4,1172,4.81
