1753066,5,B00006G8KI,"My entire life I have heard of the legend of Hulkamania, when this captivating trend began I wasent even born yet, however I can remember when I was just three years old and I went to my older brother's friend's house to see Hulk Hogan face Randy Savage for the WWF Title at Wresltmania 5 and I finally experienced Hulkamania for the first time and from 1989-2002 I have witnissed this legend captivate crowds wherever he has gone, the great things about this DVD is what made Hulkamania legendary in it's own right, it has not just Hulk Hogan but Terry Bollea and of course the fans, there is a very touching moment at the end of the first disc that shows an 18 year old kid cry over his former actions and how Hulk Hogan brought him from a bad street life to where he is today, Hulk Hogan is a role model for every kid and sets a good example for anyone, this DVD is truly touching and exposes what the wrestling business is both in and out of the Ring, so purchase this DVD and don't forget to remember that the greatest entertainer of our time is Hollywood Hulk Hogan!",1030060800,2,1072,4.285714285714286
1753067,4,B00006G8KI,"WWE has really got themselves together over the past year as far as video releases go. I rarely buy their home videos, but after picking up the very well done ""Undertaker: This is My Yard"" DVD several months ago, I decided to give them a chance.
This DVD focuses on Hulk Hogan, and it is just as well done (if not better) than the Undertaker one. The DVD is absolutely LOADED and has TWENTY SEVEN extra matches and interviews spanning from his debut in 1979 to the mid 90s and his early WCW career (plus the clip of him tearing up a cardboard Rock from Raw in Feb. '02).
The one hour feature is pretty well done, although I have one major gripe with it. Just like the Undertaker DVD, they emphasize the beginning and more recent parts of his career, but then gloss over a good chunk of the middle. In this case, they show a lot of Hogan in the late 70's to the mid 80's, then they spend about 2 minutes on the late 80's to early 90's, showing short clips of Hogan fighting 'taker and Earthquake. It regains pace around the mid-late 90's and the introduction of the (WCW version) NWO, then we jump to the recent WWE and are treated to the same old hype packages we've all seen a million times prior to his PPV matches against Rock and HHH. Still, the look at the early years is especially excellent and makes it worthwhile regardless.
Also worth mentioning about the feature, we get a few stories that really haven't been ""out there"" too much in the past, most notably (Hogan's take) on why Randy Savage liked him, then hated him, then liked him, and then hated him again, as well as his argument with Vince McMahon Sr. over whether he should do Rocky III or not.
As said above, the extras are plentiful, although I question a few of them. They include some hard to find important matches, like his WWF debut in 1979 (against Ted Dibiase, no less), his pre-Wrestlemania III match with Andre at Shea Stadium, and his Tuesday in Texas match with Undertaker from '91. They really should have put the Rock vs. Hogan match from WM 18 and Hogan's title victory over HHH a month later on here, but they did not, and instead ""treat"" us to Hogan vs. Big Bossman and Hogan vs. Nikolai Volkoff. I guess WWE wants to get as much money as they can out of you, making you buy other discs to get the whole story. No surprise there.
Still, this is arguably the best DVD they have put out yet.",1029974400,3,2375,4.327354260089686
1753068,5,B00006G8KI,"I got this the very day it came out. I am a Hulk-A-Maniac from way back. This DVD is like a godsent. It has everything you could ask for as a Hogan fan, from his beginnings all the way up to April 2002. You'll see Hogan talk candidly about superstars of the past. The first disc features a great documantary that goes through all the phases of Hulk's alustrious career. They tackle some of the great feuds of his career, Piper, Paul Orndorff and Randy Savage are all brought up.
The extras are incredible, you'll see Hogan's very first match among some great SNME matches mainly one vs, Mr. Perfect. A great one. If you want one DVD that truly sums up a legends legacy this is it. Vince and company digs deep, deep, deep into the company's archives and comes out with the best DVD they have ever and I mean EVVVVERRRRRR released. Whatch ya gonna do when this DVD runs wild over you??????",1029888000,2,887,4.381818181818182
1753069,5,B00006G8KI,"Ok. When I was a kid, I use to hate Hogan. I loved the bad guys. But as I grew up (I'm 26 now) I became to appreciate the greatness that is HULKAMANIA. This DVD is proudly displayed in my home, much to my girlfriends delight. Great DVD with pretty much every match, highlight, & interviews spanning the 2 decades of the Hulksters career. Highly recommended for even the casual fan. A quick EASTER EGG...
On the 2nd DVD got to the 3rd extra section where you see the ""HULK STILL RULES"" logo on the bottom right, highlight it and hit ok, or whatever you have to push on your system to play a selection. You'll get to a Tuesday Night Titan clip of Hogan playing guitar to ""Mean Gene"" singing his infamous ""Tutti Fruiti"" song.",1029888000,3,722,4.3161764705882355

1753071,5,B00006G8KI,"Whether you love him or hate him, Hulk Hogan's DVD is the single best DVD the WWF/WWE has ever put together.  Every WWE superstar should get this kind of career retrospective.  There are matches from every era, and they are not the Wrestlemania matches that everyone has seen. There is his debut at Madison Square Garden in 1979, two matches from 1980 including his match with Andre The Giant at Shea stadium, his first appearance back in the WWF in December 1983, his win over the Iron Sheik in 1984 to win the title, the Big Event in Toronto in 1986 versus Paul Orndorff, Summerslam '89 teaming with Brutus Beefcake to take on The Macho Man and Zeus, Bash at the Beach versus Flair in 1994, Tuesday in Texas where he wins the title back from The Undertaker in 1991, three matches from Saturday Night's Main Event including a tag team match with Andre to face King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd, Wrestlevision versus Rowdy Roddy Piper in 1985, his Royal Rumble win in 1990, Survivor Series 1988, a tag team match with Mean Gene against Mr Fuji and George ""The Animal"" Steele, and a match with Big John Studd in Puerto Rico outside in the pouring rain.  There are also several appearances on Tuesday Night Titans and alot of interview segments.  AND these are just the extras, I haven't even watched the main program yet.

Classic matches spanning from Hogan's debute throughout his golden years in the WWE, and even a highlight or two from WCW.  The base peice on Hogan sheds his feelings of fear on working with Andre the Giant and King Kong Bundy, as well as his relationship with Randy Savage.  But the extras are where its at.  1 hour on the first disk and 4 hours(!) on the second disk of pure vintage Hogan nostalgic goodness.

1753159,5,B00006G8KI,"I bought this dvd last year and I'd say I watch it just about every other week. If your a huge Hulk Hogan fan or even a fan of the 80's and early 90's wrestling era, this 2-set dvd is a must.",1236556800,,191,3.5714285714285716
1753160,2,B00006G8KI,Just did not have very good matches and was not complete enough.  Not very good when you consider the career of Hulk Hogan. Not worth having.,1179014400,,141,4.423076923076923
1753161,3,B00006G8KI,"This DVD doesn't really do Hulkamania justice.  It starts with stories from the early stages of his career in Memphis, leaving Vince St. to do Rocky III, and Vince Jr. calling him back to the WWF to lead his vision of ""sports entertainment"" & breaking barriers in wrestling to him finally leaving the WWF.  The DVD starts to go downhill from here because it only waste around 10 mins. on him being involved with WCW/nWo and the backstage problems there with Vince Russo.  The main highlight of this documentary would be Hogan ""shooting"" on Roddy Piper, King Kong Bundy, Paul Orndorff, Andre The Giant, and Randy Savage.

Matches Include:
vs. Ted Dibiase - Around a decade before these men would go on to bigger fame under ""Hulkamania"" & ""Million $ Man"" and headline the first SummerSlam in that same building, they fought here in what was Hogan's Madison Square Garden debut.  Both men displayed their strengths in this match as Dibiase had the superior speed while Hogan had the strength factor & able to capitalize on an opening made by a mistake by Dibiase.  It's really ironic how the crowd sided with Dibiase & against Hogan knowing how heavily things would change between the two men years later
""MSG"" Dec. '79

vs. Andre The Giant - This was their most famous encounter before their feud in close to 7 years later for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania III with this having another ironic twist in Hogan being the heel & Andre being the babyface.  Hogan talked in the documentry about how Andre used to ""tan his hyde"" and he wasn't kidding as Hogan was able to match strength against Andre & wear him down with moves like a bearhug but Andre was always able to get an advantage & just beat Hogan up with chops/punches & even an back stretch that had him shove his leg into Hogan's back putting more pressure there.  The match itself wasn't much as the aftermath was where Andre was left a bloody mess.
Showdown At Shea '80

vs. WWF Champion Iron Sheik - Honestly, I can try to summerize this match but who hasn't already seen this match already & what can't be said about it that hasn't been said about it for over 20 years.  Gorilla Monsoon summerized this match at the end with one phrase, ""Hulkamania Is Here!""
""MSG"" Jan. 84
(""History Of WWE Championship"" & ""Hulk Hogan: The Utlimate Anthology"")

vs. Paul Orndorff - Mr. Wonderful was on the best best workers at that time because his stuff looked so stiff that you thought the guy was really going to get hurt. Hogan did bring his A game to this one was Orndorff always did & put on a great back & forth match.
The Big Event '86
(""Hulk Hogan: The Utlimate Anthology"")

vs. Andre The Giant - The biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record. Just like the Sheik match, there's nothing I can say about this match that hasn't been said for years & who hasn't seen this already.
WrestleMania III
(""History Of WWE Championship"" & ""Hulk Hogan: The Utlimate Anthology"")

w/Brutus Beefcake vs. Randy Savage & Zues - For those who don't remember Zues...it's probably a good thing that you don't but I'll remind you anyways in that Zues (the actor Tommy Lister who's more famous for his role as ""Deebo"" in the Friday movies) was the lead heel in the Hulk Hogan movie ""No Holds Barred"" so as an attempt to cross promote the movie, Zues was brough into WWF to feud with Hogan.
Taking into concideration that Zues was strictly an actor & not a wrestler, this was a real good match here as Savage was a real workhorse at this time & really carried the team while Zues played his role well in being a monster who couldn't be hurt (outside of raking his eyes) while Hogan & Beefcake was able to sell the punishment while able to have the crowd constantly behind them.  Again, a fun match concidering the ""Zues"" factor with an entertaining ending between Sherri & Elizabeth.
SummerSlam '89

vs. Ben Ortiz & Angelo Gomez - This was back when Hogan was a heel with Freddie Blassie & was nothing more than a exibition match for Hogan to display his dominating strength & presence.
""All Star Wrestling"" Jan. '80

vs. WCW Champion Ric Flair - Hogan's debut match in WCW and one of Hogan's best wrestling matches in his WCW reign. He all know Ric Flair is one of the best wrestlers in the history of the sport & Hogan knows what to do to get the crowd hooked into a match. This was a match that did live up to all the hype it had surrounding it.
WCW Bash At The Beach '94
(""Hulk Hogan: The Utlimate Anthology"" & ""Rise & Fall Of WCW"")

w/Gene Okerland vs. George Steele & Mr. Fuji - Before the match, you get a short interview with Mean Gene explaining the setup behind this match.  This was really just a glorified handicap match as Okerland was just a prop in the corner while Hogan handled his business with Mr. Fuji & Steele but there were a few comedic moments when Hogan ""tagged in"" Gene along with their celebration afterwards.
Aug. '84

vs. WWF Champion Undertaker - This was the rematch from their Survivor Series match (on Undertaker's DVD) which was Hogan going back & forth with Taker until the outside interfearence from Paul Bearer, Ric Flair & Jack Tunney. This was a fun match for me to watch.
Tuesday In Texas '91
(""Hulk Hogan: The Utlimate Anthology"")

vs. Big John Studd - This match was nicknamed ""The Puerto Rican Downpour"" as Hogan & Studd wrestled in a very unusual situation where it started heavily rain during their match to the point where you just saw a crowd full of umbrellas and the ring area just got so wet that both men started slipping & losing their balance towards the end.  This match wasn't much (under 10 mins.) but it's definately something that you don't see everyday.
Oct. '85

vs. Nikolai Volkoff - This was a match where Volkoff cheated to get the advantage early with Hogan recovering & getting on a role before Volkoff came back & showed amazing displays of strength against Hogan various times before Hulk once again gained the momentum on his way to victory.  A good match that went back & forth between both men.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Oct. '85

vs. Mr. Perfect - Eventhough Perfect got a hit in here & there, this was all Hogan with Curt Hennig being the ""perfect"" spotmonkey for Hogan.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Apr. '90
(""Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event"")

w/Andre The Giant vs. King Kong Bundy & Big John Studd - Jesse Ventura nicknamed this match accurately as ""the battle of the beef"" since these were the four biggest men in the WWF at that time.  This was a short match with Hogan & Andre dominating Studd & Bundy throught the entire match.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Nov. '85

vs. Roddy Piper - This was another match that was pretty short & no different than any other Hogan/Piper match where Piper heavily relied on his mix of heavily street fighting/brawling along with some wrestling while Hogan brough himself to Piper's level relying on fist fighting & using his strength before things got out of control with interference by Bob Orton & Paul Orndorff.
The Wrestling Classic '85

Royal Rumble Match - This only shows everything after Hogan enters the Rumble match. Typical Royal Rumble stuff that you see but the big story here was the first confrontation between Hogan & Ultimate Warrior which started the build towards their WrestleMania VI match.
Royal Rumble '90
(""Hulk Hogan: The Utlimate Anthology - Bonus Disc"")

Elimination Match w/Randy Savage, Hillbilly Jim, Hercules, Koko B. Ware vs. Big Boss Man,  Akeem, Ted DiBiase, King Haku, Red Rooster - This match has so many stories going on at the same time that it was interesting to watch as it continued to tease the breakup of Red Rooster & Bobby Heenan along with the continued tease of tension at the end of the match between Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage revolving around Elizabeth. The match itself had all the main players put forth their best effort & was really fun to watch.
Survivor Series '88

Other DVD extras include Hogan's return to the WWF in Dec. '83, past promos from Saturday Night's Main Event & Tuesday Night Titans, and a promo from RAW with a cardboard cutout of The Rock along with hidden extras such as the ""Real American"" music video & Mean Gene singing ""Tutti Frutti"" with Hulk playin' the guitar. Again, the documentary isn't anything special & the lack of WCW footage really shows how ""one sided"" this documentary is but the DVD extras save this DVD. Get it if your a big fan of Hulkamania in the WWF.",1148688000,2,8469,4.580687830687831

Also.... the last 10 minutes of the 1990 royal rumble that hogan won. plenty of classic promos, 2 great segments on TNT, including when he trained mean gene and hulk's protein powder. the documentary is good but cuts away to soon when we get to the 90's. it seems like we go straight from ""winding down in the 90's"" to the nWo. I strongly reccomend this dvd.",1130803200,6,2122,4.926760563380282
1753164,5,B00006G8KI,"This is a 2 DVD set which runs for approximately 6 hours. I watched it in 3 separate sessions of approximately 2 hours over the same weekend. Disc-1 has what I refer to as the main section of the DVD, plus some extras. While Disc-2 totally comprises extras. The main section of the DVD runs for approximately 65 minutes, and definitely should have been longer. Ninety minutes would have been more appropriate for a wrestler such as Hogan, who has almost 25 years of experience in the industry.

We kick off the DVD with a decent little introduction of how Hogan got into wrestling. He actually was playing in a rock band in 1978, and his entrance into the WWF was through the legendary Brisco Brothers. Hogan started off as a heel, and had an almost contradictory gimmick, in that he practically played a big strong prettyboy. The major factor he had going for him at the start though, was the managerial services of Classy Freddy Blassie. Hogan seemed to be able to draw heel heat on his own, but Blassie was the icing on the cake.

From there we go to an interesting little discussion concerning Hogan's part in Rocky 3. Vince McMahon Sr basically stated that it was either wrestling or movies. When Hogan chose Rocky 3, he basically walked out the door & surfaced in the Minneapolis based AWA. That wasn't for long though, as he returned to the WWF in 1983 as a face. Within a year, he had defeated The Iron Sheik to become the World HeavyWeight Champion.

This was the time that the WWF was starting to get mainstream audiences tuning in. Pat Patterson is quoted as saying that Hogan was the main ingredient that helped Vince Jr realize his dream of the WWF being more than just wrestling. Arguably the focal point of this was March-31 1985 at WrestleMania. Hogan briefly talks about this & claims that Roddy Piper only ""looked after #1 (himself) & never let his guard down"", which was a very bad thing. He goes on to comment about King Kong Bundy (""Tough to work with"") and Paul Orndorff (""Occasionally took it too far"" & genuinely hurt Hogan in the ring).

A little more emphasis is then placed on the legendary WrestleMania 3 match, and Andre The Giant himself. Apparently the 2 gained respect for each other when they were in Japan & Tatsumi Fujinami basically turned a bout against Hogan into a shoot-fight. Andre really wanted to help afterwards, but Hogan fought his own battles. Obviously, parts of the WrestleMania 3 match are shown, including the bodyslam finish. Hogan then moves on and speaks about Randy Savage. He says that they were once best friends, and it was Elizabeth's fault that they no longer see eye to eye. He calls Savage ""ignorant"" and implies that he was always paranoid about Hogan stealing his girlfriends (even Gorgeous George years later in WCW).

This is the point on the DVD where the major downfall is. It jumps to a quick discussion about Vince thinking that Hulkamania should start coming to a close, because both it & Hogan was getting old. From there, we go straight to Hogan's WCW debut. Hang on a moment!!! What happened to the direction-changing face vs face WrestleMania 6 title match against The Ultimate Warrior??? How did he feel about passing the torch that night? What about the subsequent angles against Yokozuna? Even a brief discussion on Bret Hart wouldn't have looked out of place. But basically, 3 years of his career is just ignored & we jump straight to his WCW debut.

The WCW portion was also a little too brief, as he only really discussed Savage (again), his Bash At The Beach NWO heel turn (""The NWO was successful because I was the leader"") & Vince Russo (""A huge mistake in WCW""). Throughout this section, many segments are shown, including parts of Hogan's after-match interview at BATB '96.

Back to the WWE we (too quickly) go, as Hogan discusses his February 2002 debut & the subsequent WrestleMania 18 match against The Rock. Hogan is quoted as saying ""I thought I was the best until I got in the ring with The Rock"". Rock stuck with him (referring to his own slow pace I presume) throughout the match, and handled the surprising booing of him perfectly. Hogan feels the shaking of hands after the match was the true passing of the torch. Hogan would have liked to remain a heel a little longer, but both he & Vince knew that they had to go with the crowd momentum & not only turn him face, but have him win the Undisputed Championship. This happened at Backlash against Triple H (who he calls ""a great ring general""). Hogan also discusses how hard it was to calm down after the 10 minute applause he got from a Montreal crowd. He had obviously been genuinely touched by this moment.

The main section of the DVD ends with a rather nice touch, as some lifelong fans meet & greet the Hulkster at an autograph signing. This was good to end with, as it showed the stature that Hogan was held in by his fans. Overall, this was a very good watch. But it definitely deserved to be more complete with an additional 20-30 minutes. The extra time could have perfectly been split in half by the last years of Hulk's WWF run (including the matches with Warrior, Yokozuna, etc..) and further detail on his WCW run.

MAIN - Extras, Extras & More Extras

I tossed & turned about how I was going to structure this, but at the end I just said ""stuff it"" & decided to list all the extras & give a brief opinion.

December '79 vs Ted Dibiase: This was Hogan's MSG debut. It was a slow but fascinating match, as watching these 2 at a very young age was interesting. Of all things, Hogan won with a bearhug.

August '80 vs Andre The Giant: This is truly classic footage. Held outdoors at Shea Stadium, this took place almost 7 years before the legendary WrestleMania 3 match. Hogan actually body-slammed Andre during this match as well, showing the potential that he truly had. Hogan was the heel in this match, and it was the only bout on the DVD which Hogan lost. That's right folks, the Ultimate Warrior match is not included.

December '83 Return to the WWF: This was during a match between Bob Backlund & a Wild Samoan. After constant interference, Backlund goes to the back for help, and brings out the returning (face) Hulkster. An after-match interview is shown discussing Hulk's reasons for returning.

January '84 vs The Iron Sheik: Apart from it being a little short (6 minutes), this was actually an excellent match. Hogan goes for the quick win & dominates the first 3 minutes. The Sheik then takes control, only to see the Hulkster come back to drop the Legdrop of Doom to win the HeavyWeight title for the first time. An after-match interview is also shown.

August '84 training Mene Gene: This was a segment on the Tuesday Night Titans show setting up a match which is shown later. Classic footage with a few laughs (including Vince wearing a pink suit). Another segment is shown later where Hogan blends a health drink & preaches about vitamins.

August '86 vs Paul Orndorff: This match also took place outdoors, this time in Toronto. A very good grudge match, with a disappointing DQ finish.

March '87 vs Andre The Giant: I can't really add much more to what you already know about this WrestleMania 3 match, other than that it's worth watching for the legendary commentary of Gorilla Monsoon & Jesse Ventura alone.

August '89 teaming with Brutus Beefcake vs Randy Savage & Zeus: This took place at SummerSlam, and includes a pre-match interview, plus commentary by Tony Schiavone. I remember as a kid being scared by the cross-eyed monster known as Zeus. In retrospect, I realize he couldn't actually wrestle. But Savage was at his best here & carried Zeus (and arguably the other 2) to a decent match. It was far from perfect, but was huge at the time.

DISC-2

January '80 vs Ben Ortiz & Angelo Gomez: An All-Star Wrestling handicap match against 2 jobbers. Should have been excluded, and is only worth watching for a very loud guy in the crowd, and the after-match interview, where you can really tell how much Hogan improved in subsequent years.

July '94 vs Ric Flair: Bash At The Beach '94 match which also has Jimmy Hart & Sensational Sherri running around at ringside. This was the much-anticipated, but slightly anti-climactic first match between the two legends. Not that bad, but should have been better due to the occasion.

October '85 Tuesday Night Titans Clip: Includes the usual preaching, a 3 minute match against perennial jobber Tiger Chung Lee, and a poem by Leaping Lanny Poffo. Should have been excluded.

August '84 teaming with Mene Gene vs George 'The Animal' Steele & Mr Fuji: Includes a pre-match interview, and is basically a vehicle for Hogan to be over-shadowed by the sight of Mene Gean in wrestling tights. I'll give you one guess who got the pin. Should have been excluded.

December '91 vs The Undertaker: I absolutely loved this. This was the rematch held a few days after Survivor Series when The Undertaker won his first world title with the help of Ric Flair. It was far from a match-of-the-year contender, but watching The Undertaker playing his original gimmick was so fascinating. This was also one of the few times Hogan was involved in a feud with a newcomer. Hogan won, but the title was once more held up, leading to Ric Flair's classic win at the '92 Royal Rumble.

October '85 vs Big John Studd: This was an outdoor match in Puerto Rico, and was progressing terribly until something interesting happened. It started to pour with rain. I'm not talking a light shower either, it was genuinely bucketing down. The wrestlers couldn't keep their feet, so the referee ad-libbed & called a countout victory to Hogan.

October '85 vs Nikolai Volkoff: Short & decent mid-80's big man match stressing Hogan's patriotism to the USA. Includes interviews both before & after the match.

April '90 vs Mr. Perfect: This match took place less than a month after Hogan's title loss to The Warrior. I was really looking forward to this bout, but it was disappointingly short, and didn't prove anything about how Hogan would handle a wrestler with Hennig's style at the time. The Genius Lanny Poffo was with Hennig at ringside.

November '85 teaming with Andre The Giant vs Big John Studd & King Kong Bundy: Holy cow, there were a lot of pounds in the ring during this match. Hogan was the smallest of the competitors!!! The bout actually moved quite swiftly for it's five minute length, and ended in a DQ when Andre got caught in the ropes & the heels wouldn't stop beating on him.

November '85 vs Roddy Piper: To be honest, this match wasn't all that different to those the two fought 12 years later in (1997) WCW. Hmmm, playing the devils advocate, it just goes to show how far some wrestlers can go without improving their in-ring skills. As previously touched on, Piper wouldn't let Hogan beat him, so this one ended with a DQ when Bob Orton interfered.

January '90 Royal Rumble: The footage starts when Hogan enters at #25. It's always fascinating watching old Rumbles. The highlight of this one was seeing a brief one-on-one contest between Hogan and The Warrior just 2 months before their WrestleMania showdown. The crowd just loved it. Hogan wins the Rumble, last eliminating Mr. Perfect.

November '88 Survivor Series Match: Hogan teamed with Randy Savage, Hercules, Koko B.Ware & Hillbilly Jim vs Ted Dibiase, Haku, Akeem, The Big Bossman & The Red Rooster. Well, I won't say that watching the old 5 on 5 elimination format is as good as watching old Rumbles, but they're still interesting. Hogan & Savage survived, last eliminating Haku. This was the start of the dissension between the two, as Hogan hogged the spotlight & Elizabeth after the match.

Promos on Harley Race, The Genius, The Big Bossman, The HonkyTonk Man & with a cardboard (The) Rock: All are short, and are only used to close the DVD.

All in all, this DVD is a 'must-buy' for any wrestling enthusiast, and is the best WWE DVD I have seen so far. You don't necessarily have to be a fan of Hogan to have this one in your collection, as there is such an array of wrestlers & matches included. You also get classic commentaries from the likes of Monsoon, Heenan, Ventura, Vince, Okerlund & Hayes. The DVD format allows you to be able to pick & choose what you want to watch, and with 6 hours of footage, there is bound to be quite a few things that tickles your fancy. The major drawbacks are not speaking on & including the WrestleMania 6 match against The Ultimate Warrior, having the extra matches out of chronological order, and including 2 or 3 boring matches in favor of larger ppv bouts.",1114732800,7,12575,4.637303370786517

Any of his tag team matches with Benoit as his partner

Chris Benoit (Royal Rumble)

Brock Lesnar (Wrestlemania 19)

Charlie Hass (Angle's return)

1753223,1,B00006G8KI,"Hulk Hogan is known world wide. He is like Ric Flair, he might now show much talent in the ring but his charisma can attract sold out crowds everywheres. The dvd seems like a good idea with 15 matches, what can go wrong? Well Ive viewed the matches, its a mixed bag. Most of the matches I have on other tapes, the ones I don't know aren't that great. The Royal Rumble was dumb considering Hogan came in at 25 and thats where they started it. Where is the WCW years? Did WWE just forget where Hogan went from 1993 to 2003? Sure they showed his match against Ric Flair when he first started in WCW but what happened after that match? They could have included some new matches like his match against The Rock at Wrestlemaina 18 or his title win over Triple H as well. The documentery on this dvd feels to rushed, like they threw a bunch of random clips and got his 10 second opinion about the person. The clips are cool but they go by so fast. I just bought Ric Flair's dvd set and Im hoping its better then this set on matchs, the Rumble is suppose to be in its full form and his matches with Ricky Steamboat are considered classics. Im excited for that set, but as for Hogan- it's good but feels a bit rushed, Ive noticed that about a couple of WWE best of DVDs.

This DVD covers Hogan's life as well as his wrestling career and Hogan was probably the best well known and best wrestler ever before Austin & The Rock.",1102118400,2,402,3.9382716049382718
1753225,5,B00006G8KI,"This DVD is essential for any pro wrestling fan! In addition, it's a great nostalgia present to give to anyone who lived through the ""Hulkamania"" era of the 1980s! Pro Wrestling has changed a lot since Hogan's day, both in pace and storylines.  However, this DVD proves that Hogan's ability to read a crowd and pump up the fans will never be matched again. (The man was on the cover of ""Sports Illustrated,"" for crying out loud!)

On a technical level, Hogan wasn't much of a wrestler.  But he had the size, the look, and the charisma to become the ""Babe Ruth of Wrestling."" This DVD gives a nice biographical documentary on ""The Hulkster,"" and traces his evolution from early days in the business to Wrestlemania 18.

It would have been nice to see even some more matches. (For example, what about Hogan's classic 1989 steel cage match with the Big Boss Man???), but most fans will be very satisfied with the many included here.  It would have also been nice to see a few episodes of Hogan's Saturday morning cartoon, ""Rock n' Wrestling,"" as those were pivotal in bringing wrestling to the masses (and to the youth). Nonetheless, it's nice to see some of Hogan's matches from the 1980s on DVD, as the WWE is yet to release any of the old Wrestlemania's (1 - 10) on DVD. Fans of biopic wrestling DVDs should also check out Ric Flair's new one!",1101427200,5,1343,4.533057851239669
1753226,1,B00006G8KI,"I hated Hulk Hogan! He was so hammy and did the EXACT same thing every match. What a bore! But I guess things can never get too boring when the average wrestling fan has the mental capacity of a lemming. Anyways, back to Hogan.... He was ALWAYS the champion to the point that it was just stupid. After he won the darn match he spent more time in the ring posing than the entire match lasted. I was so happy when Andre the Giant (a true talent) beat him and later on when the Ultimate Warrior pinned him. Really took the wind of his sails. Hogan's movie suck. No Holds Barred and Sububurban Commando anyone? Here's to hoping he stays retired and never comes back.",1095033600,6,662,4.304
1753227,4,B00006G8KI,"This was almost a perfect 5 star DVD. I won't bother with another reveiw of whats on the disc ect.. theres already plenty here to read already.
My only disapointment is that the first disc just does not have enough on it. It is about an hour long, and missing some of the best moments in the hulkamania career... where the hell is the match when the Hulkster went up against the Ultimate Warrior? Hogan might not have won that match, but it was still one of the most legendary matchs to this date. And also, theres no sign of when Hogan teamed up with the Warrior at one of the SummerSlams and the duo they became after that.. even if they didn't show the full match, they should have included the HOGAN/WARRIOR days. There is only a short glimpse of the Warrior during the mid 90's in the WCW and thats it. It didn't even show those matchs!
It also only showed a short leg drop on Yokozuna at wrestlemania '93, that whole match lasted about one minute, why wasn't that included? It was Hogans last WWF title win in the 90's. Infact, there seems to be nothing from Wrestlemanias at all after Wrestlemania 3!
It barely showed anything with Hogan & Randy Savage! A few words, and a few look back at things, but nothing from some of there matchs! Also, nothing about how many un-defeated wrestlers he brought to there first defeat! Sid Justice(Viscious) is just one that comes to mind amongst many others. Hardly anything from the WCW era, match wise. There's next to nothing about the NWO, Wolf-Pac stuff,  Everything is mostly the acting side. Nothing from when he signed with the WCW and that terrible acting, but funny fake press confrence when he signed with WCW...too much is missing. Theres no VS McMahn footage from Wrestlemania 19.
I hope if the WWE ever re-issue this DVD that they add some of the best footage that hasn't been included here onto the DVD. Other then that, it is a pretty good DVD, if you like Hogan? The second disc is over 2 hours long and features rare matchs for anyone intrested, but it puzzles me why the bonus disc is over 2 hours, but the feature presentation is about an hour, and dosent show some of the best moments in wrestling history that Hogan was part of!
EGGS: There are 2 hidden eggs, one on each disc, both found the same way.
Go to the chapter selection/Extras , and go to NEXT, and go to the last (3rd) menu, and then press right to highlight the Hulk still rules logo. On Disc one you will find the ""Real American"" video clip. And on Disc 2 you will see footage of Hogan playing bass and Mean Gene playing piano, with a band playing ""Tutti Frutti""!!!",1088294400,5,2595,4.417536534446764
1753228,4,B00006G8KI,"Arguably, this is one of the best DVD efforts on the part of the WWE. If anyone was lacking in a DVD set, it was Hulk Hogan. Certainly not an outstanding ""wrestler"", Hogan, nevertheless, helped pave the way for all the ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austins, Rocks, Undertakers, and Goldbergs in wrestling today. Though oft times lacking in truth, Hogan gives his candid comments before each chapter in the set, and it allows for the newer fans to have some (slightly skewed) background into the goings on during the intial periods in question.
The match and content listings are readily avaiable elsewhere, so there is no sense in my listing them off here. I will say that all the CHAPTERS contained clipped matches and segments whereas the EXTRAS section contains full matches and interviews (*note* the second disc is made up entirely of matches,interviews, and segments)
Older fans make recognize a very young Ted Dibase in Hogan's 1979 Madison Square Garden debut match. Dibase was far from being the much ""beloved"" Million Dollar Man here as you will discover for yourself.
You'll see many classic matches and angles that helped define Hogan as not just another wrestler, but a true superstar. This is a great treat for all the fans that remember staying up on the weekends to watch Hogan's bouts on NBC's ""Saturday Night's Main Event"". This is for the fans who recoiled in shock as a Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan-led Andre the Giant ripped the cross necklace right off Hogan during the Piper's Pit segment. This  is for the fans who remember Hogan battling the likes of King Kong Bundy and ""Big"" John Studd. Finally, this is for the fans who were true ""Hulkamaniacs"" at heart. Great angles and famous moments make up the bulk of this set. Suffice to say, watching this set is like stepping into a time machine and going back to the wrestling boom of the 80's.
This is more than just a Hulk Hogan love fest collection. This is a look back at the rise of professional wrestling as we know it. Let's face it, without Hulk Hogan, wrestling would not have become the phenomenon it is today. Few could have successfully embraced both the true wrestling fans and the mainstream media the way Hulk Hogan did at the time. This set does a great job of chronicling the transformation of Terry Bollea to that of the ""Immortal"" Hulk Hogan.
Unfortunately, there are just a few caveats that blemish an otherwise near-perfect DVD:
The Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior encounter from Wrestlemania XI seemed a little conspicuous by its absence, but that match did little for Hogan's career in the long run, so its exlcusion is really a matter of splitting hairs. Also, it would have been nice to have included the Hogan vs. Rock encounter from Wrestlemania XVII, especially since the latter part of this set contained teasers and promos for this match. Ideally, this match would have been the way to end the set. Instead, we are treated to various clips. I guess that is better than nothing
Hogan's WCW run, for the most part, was heavily glossed over. Granted, Hogan had obviously seen his better days at this point in time, but his presence helped ignite the famous Monday Night Wars. Aside from clips and mentions of Hogan's infamous nWo heel turn, there is nary a match or otherwise any indication of how big the ORIGINAL nWo actually was .I say that rather emphatically because the nWo had basically become nothing more than a failed attempt at freshening up a stale product when Vince McMahon ""reintrouded"" them in early 2002. Still, Hogan's time spent in the nWo was classic. Not so much in terms of match quality, but in charisma, showmanship, and the revitalization of his career. Sadly, you're not likely to walk away with the full effect of how important this time was thanks to the WWE treating it as though it were just another footnote in modern wrestling history.
It seems very odd that this set would not include a single Hogan vs.""Macho Man"" Randy Savage match. Sure a Hogan-Savage match might not be brought up in the same breath as say a Steamboat-Flair match, but it is still a perfect demonstration of a feud that can span many years and two wrestling companies. Any true wrestling fan can tell you that Savage has always had an unquenched hatred for Hogan, even when the two were on so-called friendly terms. Fans could always sense an underlying tension between the two (this is partly due to the fact that Savage and Hogan REALLY do despise each other) A feud this intense is a rarity nowadays given the WWE's (mostly) hackneyed way of presenting the concept of a wrestling feud as lasting maybe two months at the most without any hint of continuity from there on out. One only need to see a Hogan vs. Savage match to feel the real life tension between these two men. Again, you are not likely to get the full feel of the feud simply by watching this set. Not including a single Hogan vs. Savage match on this set seems near-criminal in nature.
In my opinion, Hogan has never been a superb wrestler, ala Chris Benoit or Shawn Michaels. However, any wrestling fan worth his/her weight in water will unequivocally state that Hogan is one of the most charasmatic wrestlers of all time, and it certainly shows here. If you can stomach Hogan's ego and own unique brand of revisionist history (going so far as to claim he made the ""Macho Man"" character that Randy Savage became in addition to a few more tall tales), and a few glaring omissions, you'll no doubt find this to be one of your favorite wrestling DVDs of all time.
Love him or hate him, you simply cannot deny the fact that Hogan made wrestling what it is today. Buy this set and see history unfold for yourself",1074729600,11,5658,4.663663663663663

Wow, was I disappointed. All I got was a 1-hour documentary and a bunch of matches thrown together with really no rhyme or reason. The documentary was good, but it could've easily been two or three hours long. I walked away from my TV frustrated because I had so many questions that were left unanswered. The featured matches were OK for what they were, but almost none of them were explained. What was the story behind Flair/Hogan or Piper/Hogan? Why were Hogan and Big John Studd wrestling in Puerto Rico? Who were the Mega Powers and the Mega Bucks? And many of the matches they included were LOUSY.

It is great! I especially enjoyed seeing the ""Puerto Rican Downpour"" where he fought Big John Studd and they were slipping and sliding all over the ring! It was hilarious! Also, the WWWF match(Hogan's WWE Debut) in my mind was like deja vu. He fought Ted DiBiase in his debut match. But, anyone who is either a true Hogan fan or a diehard wrestling fan would know that Hogan and DiBiase actually fought in a feud in the late 1980's when DiBiase ""bought"" Andre The Giant's services to win the WWF belt from Hogan on The Main Event February 5,1988. Then, Andre presented the belt to DiBiase and that's what led up to the WWF World Championship tournament at Wrestlemania IV! Then,Hogan helped Randy Savage win the title with a chair shot to DiBiase's back while the referee was distracted. Isn't that a coincidence or what?

I'm glad I finally checked it out.  This is not purely a tribute; it's also a behind-the-scenes view of Hulk's career, and a good one at that.  The interviews with Hogan are real (i.e. out of character) and entertaining.  Ever wonder what he really felt about Paul Orndorff?  Randy Savage?  Andre?  You'll find out here.
Also, the extras are particularly good.  I knew that Hulk had fought Andre years before the supposed ""first meeting"" at Wrestlemania III.  I did NOT know that Hulk body slammed Andre in that match as well.  (He lost anyway.)  Also, a lot of these matches will take you back to a time before wrestling was the polished ""sports entertainment"" you see today.

1753331,5,B00006G8KI,"""Hulk Still Rules"" is a fairly comprehensive look at the career of wrestling icon Hulk Hogan.  The feature proper is an hour rundown of his career.  This two disc set also contains almost four hours of bonus material including some of his most significant matches as well as classic promos and skits from WWF programming.  In all, it's probably THE BEST video put out by WWE ever and is surely a must-have in any wrestling fan's collection.
THE FEATURE:
The main feature is a ""cliff notes"" version of Hogan's wrestling career.  Among other things it chronicles how he broke into the business in the Florida independent circuit through the Brisco Brothers and how he initially entered the WWWF as a heel with Freddie Blassie.  From there it follows his career through the AWA, his phenomenal and history making second run in the 80's WWF including his feuds with Piper, Bundy, Orndorff, Andre and Savage to his second history making stint in WCW with the N W O to his recent return to the WWE.  In all, a lot of ground is covered and a lot of it is incomplete (no mentions of his feud with the Ultimate Warrior, Lex Luger or Sting) but it hits most of the major highlights.
THE EXTRAS:
If you like extras, this DVD BRINGS the extras like no other.  By far, this is THE most loaded wrestling DVD ever put out as it takes two discs to hold all the extras.  The extras are a mixed bag of classic (and non-classic matches), miscellaneous skits and some classic Hulk promos.  In all, some of it's great, some of it's not great but it's definitely stacked.  Here they are:
Disc 1:
1. Hogan's debut WWWF match against (a non-Million Dollar Man) Ted DiBiase at MSG on 12/17/79.  Kinda weird seeing Hogan as a mega-heel and DiBiase as a clean babyface.  Decent match.
2. ""Heel"" Hogan vs. Andre the Giant at Shea Stadium, 8/9/80:  7 years before their historic showdown.
3. Bob Backlund vs. the Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika), 12/83:  Hogan's WWF return from the AWA as he helps Mr. Backlund.  Post-match promo from both afterward.
4. Hogan vs. the Iron Sheik, 1/23/84:  Witness the birth of Hulkamania as Hogan captures his first WWF title.  Post-match promo by Hogan with Mean Gene (and the locker room).
5. ""Mean Gene"" training vignettes from Tuesday Night Titans.  Funny and cute stuff.
6. Hogan vs. Mr. Wonderful, The Big Event in Toronto, 8/28/86:  Awesome, big money match.
7. Hogan vs. Andre, Wrestlemania III, 3/29/87.  The match itself wasn't much, but this was THE biggest match in the history of the sport.
8. Tuesday Night Titans vignette as Hogan teaches McMahon and Lord Alfred Hayes about nutrition.
9. Hogan and Brutus ""the Barber"" Beefcake w/Elizabeth vs. Zeus and ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, Summer Slam '89.  Another classic!!
10. Easter Egg:  Title 1, Chapter 10.  ""Real American"" music video.  Cool and funny at the same time.
Disc 2
1. Hogan vs. 2 jobbers, All-Star Wrestling match, 1/2/80:  Token jobber squash match.
2. Hogan vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair, Bash at the Beach '94:  The historic first MAJOR big meeting between the two 80's legends.  One of the best Hogan matches as Flair carries Hogan to a good match.  The one lone WCW match on here.
3. Another Tuesday Night Titans skit
4. Interview with Mean Gene that leads into...
5. Hogan and ""Mean Gene"" Okerlund vs. George ""the Animal"" Steele and Mr. Fuji.  Fun match
6. Hogan vs. Undertaker (champ), This Tuesday in Texas, 12/3/91:  Hogan's rematch for the belt.
7. Hogan vs. Big John Studd from Puerto Rico in the rain.
8. Hogan vs. Nikolai Volkoff from Saturday Night's Main Event, 10/5/85.
9. Hogan vs. Mr. Perfect (w/ The Genius) from SNME, 4/28/90
10. Hogan and Andre vs. Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy from SNME:  Classic WWF style big man collision
11. Hogan vs. Piper, WrestleVision, 11/7/85:  Another classic feud.
12. Royal Rumble '90:  Joined in progress as Hogan enters featuring his confrontation against the Warrior.
13. Survivor Series '88.  Team Mega-Powers (Hogan, Savage, Hercules, Hillbilly Jim and Koko B. Ware) vs. Team Mega-Bucks (DiBiase, Bossman, Akeem, Haku, Red Rooster).  Great Survivor Series action!!
14. Classic Hogan promos:  1) King Harley Race, 2) The Genius, 3) Big Bossman, 4) The Honky Tonk Man, 5)  ""Cardboard"" Rock
15. Easter Egg:  Title 1, Chapter19,  Mean Gene sings ""Tutti Frutti"" with Hogan on Bass from TNT.
THE VERDICT:
Overall, this is by default a thumbs up as this collect some of the best matches, promos and skits and reviews the career of wrestling's biggest star.  This collection though is by no means perfect.  A lot of ground is missing and a lot of Hogan's biggest matches are not (and in my opinion should have been) included.  Some other things they could have put in are:
1. Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior from Wrestlemania
2. Hogan vs. Savage from Wrestlemania
3. Hogan vs. Sting from Starcade
4. Hogan vs. Goldberg from Nitro
5. Hogan and Rodman vs. DDP and Malone
6. Hogan and Bischoff vs. DDP and Leno
There are more but as is the DVD is stacked great as is but they definitely could have done more.  Also, the feature itself while well done is just too short at an hour.  A lot of ground is left out (like his feud with the Warriors and his WCW activities)..In all though, as is, the DVD is well done and the extras are more than enough to make any wrestling fan (Hulkamaniac or not) happy.

1753332,5,B00006G8KI,"When I was a little boy, I put no hero above Terry ""Hollywood Hulk Hogan"" Bollea. However, as I grew older, I changed with the times, but he didn't. What was worse, I started to hear reports about how difficult he was to work with behind the scenes in the former WCW, which was bad enough without having him, and how he would always put himself above the younger guys. Recently, however, on his last run, he has returned to his roots and reconciled with Vince McMahon and is now back in WWE. I've also been hearing that he has been a lot more accessible and is evidently selflessly losing to every big star WWE has now. As a result, I've regained the respect for Hogan that I once lost. And this DVD is a fitting tribute to the man.
There really isn't any period of Hogan's career that is not covered here, and that's why there's no excuse for a Hogan fan who owns a DVD player not to have it. Even if you hate Hogan and you just feel nostalgic, it's worth it because there's footage from all three of the major promotions he was in. And I would like to take time out to personally thank Terry Bollea and Vince McMahon not only for making an insecure young man rekindle his childhood with the reemergence of Hulkamania, but also by taking him back to its' heyday when he was a little boy with this very DVD.
Highly recommended. Two posedowns up!",1030665600,2,1345,4.299212598425197
1753333,2,B00006G8KI,"I was really looking forward to this DVD but it really was a let down. The story of hogan was great but the extra matched were not that good. Mostly all of them were boring, and some didn't even have announcing. Overall this is ok, but I would really think before buying it.",1030492800,,274,4.188679245283019
1753334,4,B00006G8KI,"In the world of ""smart"" wrestling fans, Hulk Hogan has been much maligned over the years.  I was first introduced to the ""immortal one"" back in 1985 and have been a 'maniac ever since.  I've seen the heydays of Saturday Night's Main Event and early Wrestlemanias, and I've suffered through the lows of poor WCW booking and promotion  with The Hulkster.  Whatever the era, whatever the moment, Hulk Hogan has been at the epicenter of wrestling.
First off, if you are not a Hogan fan, don't bother with this DVD, you'll hate it.  For the rest of us, there is a lot to enjoy.  The 60 minute documentary is well done with plenty of old WWF footage of Hogan's early career and some still shots of his AWA days.  Very cool.  It's nice to see WWE dip into that vast video library and resurrect those classic moments instead of just recylcing the latest  events of the past three years or so.  It's difficult to not feel nostalgic and a bit choked up to see some great clips of Andre and Hogan together celebrating Hogan's firt championship.  A golden moment in wrestling history for sure.  The first years of Hogan's WWF run are chronicled nicely, but the last couple of years ('91-'93) are a bit rushed.  His debut in WCW is mentioned as is the formation of the nWo, but much like his final years in his first WWF run, a little too short for my tastes.  Also for those who say Hogan is an egomaniac who simply looks out for himself, check out some of the touching moments with fans at a Toys 'R Us appearance and then tell me about Hogan's so called superego.
The are some things I would have liked to see explored a little more.  The Megapowers got a little bit of time, but there could have been more.  I would have liked to see more WCW footage as well.  Of course the nWo was given props, but there were some other classic WCW moments that would have fit in just as nicely.  Mainly the showdowns between Hogan and Warrior, the nWo split into the Woflpac and Hollywood factions, and of course the classic showdowns between Hogan and Sting.
The extra features on both discs are good.  I love seeing these matches brought back to life on the DVD format.  The picture for some of those timeless matches are very clear and the audio is cleaned up nicely.  Props to the WWE production team for doing their absolute best!  However there are some matches that were deserving to be included in the extras:
Hogan vs. Goldberg from WCW Nitro
Hogan vs. Sting from Starrcade '97
Hogan vs. Randy Savage from Wrestlemania V
So there you have it.  This is a must-have DVD for all Hogan fans.  Buy it, you won't be unhappy that you did.
Peace.",1030492800,3,2624,4.41875
1753335,2,B00006G8KI,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews I read here at Amazon.
Are we all watching the same DVD?
Here is a more realistic view for anyone thinking about buying.
1st of all, the doco. only goes for 1hour!
(come on WWE, the man has been around 20 years)
The doco goes as follows:
1) Looking at Hogan's entrance to the busines
2) Playing the bad guy early in his career
3) Brief, brief mention of Rocky III
4) Brief mention of AWA run (little footage)
5) Return to WWF and birth of Hulkamania
6) Wrestlemania I, Paul Orndof and Roddy Piper
7) Wrestlemania II and King Kong Bundy
8) Wrestlemania III and Andre the Giant
This is all great stuff, but here is where it gets weird.
After a mention of Randy Savage (and their personal problems!)
Wrestlemania IV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX are not mentioned at all!
Hogan main evented all of these (except IV where he still featured heavily). Apparently the Ultimate Warrior, Sgt Slaughter, Sid Vicious, and Yokozuna feuds never happened!
Their are brief clips of Hogan matches as he mentions this entire period in a few sentences.
Apparently he 'went away for a while' then decided to go down to WCW to show people down south Hulkamania. Brief look at inital WCW run then explanation and highlights of NWO run - no matches mentioned. No mention of steroid trials, waning popularity or fallout with McMahon.
Hogan then blames WCW's demise on Vince Russo,
and we then skip back to his WWE return. After showing him initally return as a heel we see the return of Hulkamania and spend the last 15 minutes of a 1 hour doco looking at the past 4 months and talking about The Rock.
The extras totally save this disc. Lots of rare, lost and interesting choices that many Hogan fans have probably never seen. I did find it odd that Hogan Classics such as Randy Savage (WM5) & Ultimate Warrior (WM6) aren't on here. There is also not a single match from his NWO period which he is (rightly) very proud of.
Most reviews here list them all individually so I won't go over them again.
Hope this helps.",1030406400,6,2018,4.516393442622951
1753336,5,B00006G8KI,"This DVD is awesome. I liked the DVD footage alot, first Hogan in his 1979 debut in the WWWF and then onto his first WWF Title reign from the Iron Sheik that started ""Hulkamania"" then some WCW footage of him and wrapping up with his match against Triple H at Backlash and the rebirth of Hulkamania.
But the DVD extras are amazing, 15 extra matches, I haven't even seen them all yet but I'm sure their awesome.
Some of them are:
Hulk Hogan vs Andre the Giant- Wrestlemania III
Hulk Hogan vs Iron Sheik- January 26, 1984
Hulk Hogan vs Undertaker- Tuesday Night Titans
..........And much more!

1753337,4,B00006G8KI,"Let me start by saying this:  If you're looking for a lot of ""insider"" information, then this DVD isn't for you.  Backstage information is minimal, and seems to be slanted heavily in Hogan's favor, but that's not the point of this video.  The point is to relive the career of the most popular pro wrestler in history.  And be sure to get the DVD, as it has a TON of extra matches and interviews, literally spanning Hogan's entire WWF career.  While there are a few matches (Hogan/Warrior vs. Perfect/Genius from TME) and interviews (full ""new world order of professional wrestling"" interview, first RAW promo with The Rock) included, I think that's inevitable when trying to pick moments from a career with 20 years at the top.

I don't care if you don't like Hogan, if you hate his wrestling style, if you believe McMahon was ""really"" responsable for it all (which has ""some"" truth to it).  When Hulk Hogan came out to wrestle, especially in the late 80's, it was far more electrifying than ANYTHING since, in terms of wrestlers.  If you didn't live through it, you might not comprehend it.  The whole country was talking about Wrestlemania 5.  Now, the hype has more than leveled off.  Hulk Hogan was, indeed, the man.
