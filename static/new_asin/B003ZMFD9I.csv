8410688,2,B003ZMFD9I,"Daring but static film adaptation of Abel Gonzlez Melo's play, ""Chamaco"" is a stagy production, the more so for the aesthetic resolution taken by director Juan Carlos Cremata Malberti, of filming almost everything as if from the fifth row in a theater, and for the performances of several players, especially Francisco Garca, as an aging homosexual, repeating the same over-the-top type of representation that served him better in ""Molinas Ferozz"" to play a grandmother wicker than the Wolf. A dark and gloomy portrait of people of the night, ""Chamaco"" tells a dramatic story of cruel and cold sexuality among several persons from La Habana and a young man from the country side: they all use each other for financial reasons, in a general landscape of economic and spiritual misery, leading to a tragic ending -or beginning, as its structure often resorts to flashbacks. Cremata created high expectations with his thesis film made at the Cuban international film school, and then made ""Nada"", an interesting first feature. But in the following years he opted for stage works and he has not been very successful when bringing them to the screen. This is one of those unfortunate cases.",1425081600,,1185,5.051020408163265
