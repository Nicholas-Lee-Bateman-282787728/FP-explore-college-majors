4184898,5,B003RHZ6CK,"In 1971 Peter Lawford starred as EQ in a made for TV film called Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You.  Harry Morgan of MASH and Dragnet played his dad.  The cast was pretty good, the mystery fun to follow and I thought this film might propel the two main stars into a series.  I was wrong.  When the EQ series came about it was Jim Hutton as EQ and David Wayne as the dad who took the leads.  Thank goodness.  Jim and David were brilliant as relatives and fellow detectives, one official, one amateur.  The show began with a 90 minute pilot and proceeded to a single season on TV.  The shows were loaded with major stars of the 70's as well as a host of talent from several decades which came before.  Production values were fine and included a Main Theme and had many episodes scored by the late great composer Elmer Bernstein.  Three of his movie successes included The Magnificent 7, Hawaii, and The Great Escape.  I located this series including the pilot on a DVD set from EBAY several years ago which turned out to be a pirate release.  The quality was poor but from then to this September 28 the only game in town.  Hoping they have good sound and picture quality to go along with the great cast and tuneful EB music I have preordered and look forward to visiting the 40's, the Queen family, and all the killers they kept running into once again.  There is a fun EQ fan site which may still be around dedicated to info on this series.  Great for fans both of the books and the show.  That site indicates that a couple of scripts were written for EQ but when the series was cancelled never got filmed.  One ended up being rewritten as a ""Murder, She Wrote"" episode and another used in rescripted form for another short lived Detective series.  So even if you missed the EQ series you may have ended up seeing Jessica solve the EQ crime in a modified form at a later date.  Looking forward to this set.  Hope you are too.",1282608000,24,1926,4.326815642458101
4184899,5,B003RHZ6CK,"The writing team of Manfred B. Lee and Frederic Dannay, were cousins who collaborated together, and under the pseudonym ""Ellery Queen"", produced mystery novels featuring a detective of the same name.  Their first novel featuring Ellery Queen, was published in 1929, and the detective would be featured in books for the next forty years.

Running just one season, the television series Ellery Queen Mysteries (1975-76) was based on the fictional detective, and was produced by William Link and Richard Levinson, the same team responsible for Columbo, and later Murder She Wrote.  The series was set in New York sometime after the end of World War II, and opened with a provocative introduction and Elmer Bernstein's catchy theme.

The casting was simply stellar, as Jim Hutton (The Green Berets) and David Wayne in the lead roles, had wonderful chemistry together.  Hutton was marvelous as Ellery Queen, a writer of mystery novels, with some odd personality quirks.  Ellery shared an apartment with his father Inspector Richard Queen (Wayne), the NYPD's chief of detectives.  It was through this connection, that the younger Queen often became involved in bizarre and challenging cases, mostly involving the upper crust of society.  The cast also included Queen's muscular right hand man, Sergeant Velie (Tom Reese).  Ken Swofford was slick reporter Frank Flanagan.  And a pre-Magnum P.I. John Hillerman was the uppity detective Simon Brimmer, host of the radio program The Casebook Of Simon Brimmer, who often attempted to match wits with Ellery.

Dannay's and Lee's intricate mysteries were typically set in the times they were written, and the character evolved through the decades.  A device found in the early novels was the ""reader challenge"", where at a certain point, the reader was informed that all the necessary clues to solve the mystery had been provided, and the reader was invited to solve the case, before Ellery revealed the solution.  This same device was made a part of the Ellery Queen radio dramas in the 1940's, and then also carried over to the television series, as Jim Hutton would break character, and looking straight into the camera, review key points and ask the audience if they knew the solution to the case.

The series pilot ""Too Many Suspects"" (included in the set), did well enough to justify greenlighting the series in the fall of 1975.  Well-written and produced with the Levinson and Link touch, the Ellery Queen Mysteries is great fun for lovers of classic whodunits.  The relationship between the two Queens is a key element, and David Wayne plays a great straight man to his eccentric and absent minded son.  The stories are compelling, and the presence of Frank Flanagan, and the snooty Simon Brimmer, adds some humor, and helps to keep things lively.  Originally a look back some thirty-five years to the 1940's, the series is now even more of a period piece in 2010.  Like many mystery dramas, it is a showcase for a multitude of well known stars of the era, including Vincent Price, Vera Miles, Ray Milland, Carolyn Jones, Howard Duff, Ida Lupino, George Burns, June Lockhart, Jim Backus, Eva Gabor, Bob Crane, Troy Donahue, Joan Collins, Dana Andrews, Kim Hunter, John Dehner, Lloyd Bochner, Ken Berry, Stuart Whitman, and Ed McMahon, just to name a few.

Still fondly remembered by fans, this official release will introduce Ellery Queen to a whole new generation, some who may even be encouraged to explore the original novels.  Jim Hutton, was a very talented actor, who somehow never landed the leading roles he probably should have.  At six foot five, and with a likeable onscreen persona, he was often cast in supporting roles.  Hutton the father of actor Timothy Hutton, passed away from cancer in 1979, at the age of 45.  Highly recommended to mystery and detective story lovers, The Ellery Queen Mysteries provides an opportunity to see this gifted performer, doing some of his best work.",1280880000,138,3943,5.021505376344086
4184900,5,B003RHZ6CK,"Arguably one of the best whodunit series ever put on television, Ellery Queen with Jim Hutton and David Wayne has only been available via fair to middling quality bootlegs for years. I'm glad to see Universal has finally come to their collective senses and finally released this gem of a TV show.

Created by the same team responsible for other quality mystery series like Columbo and Murder She Wrote, Ellery Queen features top flight casts and equally entertaining plots.

Can't wait for 9/28. Pre-Order is on the way.",1277251200,106,520,4.8977272727272725
4184901,5,B003RHZ6CK,"The 1975 Cult-Classic TV whodunit Ellery Queen starring the brilliant Jim Hutton is finally being released on DVD in its entirety, thanks to E1 Entertainment.

The series was based on the popular classic Ellery Queen mystery books from the 1930's. The show lasted only one season on NBC, but has remained a fan favorite.

Set in the post-WWII 1947, the show closely followed the format of the Ellery Queen mystery novels, which carefully laid out the clues before the reader/audience and invited them to attempt to solve the mystery before Ellery Queen presented the solution.

The show premiered March 23, 1975 with a telepilot, ""Too Many Suspects,"" which was adapted from the book, The Fourth Side of the Triangle. Beloved veteran character actor, David Wayne, portrayed Ellery's crusty but loveable father, Inspector Richard Queen throughout the series. Wayne perfectly delivered folksy dialog ostensibly from the 1940's like, ""Why don't we cut all the banana oil?""

Hutton (the father of actor Timothy Hutton) played Ellery to perfection, blending absent-minded goofiness with genuine emotional depth and boyish charm. Together, he and Wayne had the perfect on-screen chemistry, creating an authentic charm that remains undiminished after all of these years.

In all, 22 fun one-hour episodes followed beginning on Sept. 11, 1975, the last show airing on April 4, 1976.

In the early Queen books, just prior to the presentation of the solution to the mystery, a ""Challenge To The Reader"" was issued during which the suspects and clues were reviewed and the reader challenged to guess the solution to the crime.

This tradition was preserved in the series, when Hutton as Ellery turns from the scene to the camera and speaks directly to viewers. This occurs prior to the commercial break that led into the final act. Ellery provides a brief recap, then invites the audience to add up the clues, and to identify the guilty party.

The final act always employed the time-honored detective clich of calling all of the suspects together (it was made famous by Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, who often gathered the crowd in together in the drawing room) with Ellery presenting the solution to the group, frequently upstaging and skewering the solution proposed by whichever rival sleuth was also in the episode.

Rounding out the cast was John Hillerman, who portrayed Radio Mystery Master, Simon Brimmer. Brimmer constantly tried to upstage the Inspector and also embarrass Ellery by solving the crime first -- and he always failed.

In addition, Ken Swofford portrayed yellow journalist Frank Flannigan; Tom Reese, as the stalwart and stone-face Lt. Thomas Velie, the Inspector's right-hand man; and Nina Roman, who portrayed the Inspector's secretary, Grace, in seven episodes.

The show as also known for its clever opening montage, in which an announcer relays that this so-and-so is about to be murdered. Who is guilty? Is it ...? Next, each suspect (guest star) is shown in a brief clip, speaking a short humorous phrase. It ends with, ""Match wits with Ellery Queen and see if you can guess whodunit!""

The series was created by the writing/producing team of Richard Levinson and William Link, who also created the Classic TV mystery/police shows Mannix, Columbo and Murder, She Wrote.

""Too Many Suspects,"" the pilot episode, IS included in this six-disc complete series boxed set entitiled: ""Ellery Queen Mysteries."" The other 22 episodes included are: The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne; The Adventure of the Lover's Leap; The Adventure of the Chinese Dog; The Adventure of the Comic Book Crusader; The Adventure of the 12th Floor Express; The Adventure of Miss Aggie's Farewell Performance; The Adventure of Colonel Niven's Memoirs; The Adventure of the Mad Tea Party; The Adventure of Veronica's Veils; The Adventure of the Pharaoh's Curse; The Adventure of the Blunt Instrument; The Adventure of the Black Falcon; The Adventure of the Sunday Punch; The Adventure of the Eccentric Engineer; The Adventure of the Wary Witness; The Adventure of the Judas Tree; The Adventure of the Sinister Scenario; The Adventure of the Two-Faced Woman; The Adventure of the Tyrant of Tin Pan Alley; The Adventure of Caesar's Last Sleep; The Adventure of the Hard-Hearted Huckster; and The Adventure of the Disappearing Dagger.

In addition to these fabulous episodes, which have been completely remastered, E1 Entertainment has included a special collector's book in the set.

Guest stars truly included the cream of 1970's acting talent on the small and big screens, including: Kim Hunter, Ray Milland, Tim O'Connor, Gail Strickland, Joan Collins, David Doyle, Ray Walston, Anne Francis, Don Ameche, Susan Strasberg, Orson Bean, Dee Wallace, Lynda Day George, Tom Bosley, Pat Harrington Jr., Eve Arden, Bert Parks, Betty White, Robbert Loggia, Rene Auberjonois, Pernell Roberts, Jim Backus, Larry Hagman, George Burns, Hayden Rorke, June Lockhart, John Larroquette, Eva Gabor, Dean Stockwell, Tab Hunter, Roddy McDowall, Susan Stafford, William Schallert, Robert Alda, Arthur Godfrey, Ed McMahon, Bobby Sherman, Dick Van Patten, Tricia O'Neil, Cesar Romero, Dick Sargent, Bill Dana, Diana Muldaur, Noah Beery Jr., Troy Donahue, Vincent Price, James Sikking, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Edward Mulhare, Vera Miles, Victor Buono, Polly Bergen, Ken Berry, Norman Fell, Edward Albert, Kevin Tighe, Bibi Besch, Bob Crane, Juliet Mills, Gary Burghoff, Ronny Cox, and Walter Pidgeon.

(Important FYI: Here's a quick word about the ""real"" Ellery Queen in the literary world. ""Ellery Queen"" is actually the pseudonym used by two cousins, Frederick Dannay and Manfred B. Lee to write detective fiction. Some of the later Ellery Queen novels were ghost-written by Theodore Sturgeon, Jack Vance, and other prominent writers.

In their successful series of novels, Ellery Queen is not only the name of the author, but also the detective-hero of the stories. The writing team also wrote four novels under the name of Barnaby Ross about a Shakespearian actor/detective named Drury Lane. These novels were later reiussed under the Ellery Queen byline.

For a while in the 1930s ""Ellery Queen"" and ""Barnaby Ross"" staged a series of public debates in which one cousin impersonated Queen and the other impersonated Ross.

The early Queen novels encouraged the reader to attempt to solve the puzzle, with an explicit note in the text when the reader had all the necessary information.

There were many paperback novels written by ""Ellery Queen"" in the 1960s that did not feature the detective Ellery Queen. For instance, three novels featuring the governor's ""troubleshooter"" Mike McCall - The Campus Murders (1969, written by Gil Brewer); The Black Hearts Murder (1970, written by Richard Deming); and The Blue Movie Murders (1972, written by Edward D. Hoch) -- were published under the ""Ellery Queen"" byline. Jack Vance also wrote four of these book.)",1276560000,421,6920,5.2565729827742524

4184961,1,B003RHZ6CK,"I thought more of this series than one star, but I know most people don't read the mid-range reviews.  I have several issues with this presentation.  First, the show is so full of continuity errors that you sometimes find yourself asking yourself ""Was that intentional?  Is that a clue?""  Often it's not.  Another is that the culprit often confesses at the end of the show- sometimes when all Queen has is one of his elaborate theories to fall back on- and no evidence to speak of.  Another problem with the show is the constant references to items that were probably common knowledge in the late 1940's but not so much now, and the constant use of the SAME CARS in every episode.  Finally, the acting is often lousy and wooden, with the actors seeming to be just going through the motions.  Some of it isn't their fault though, the dialogue is often very poorly written.",1484784000,,871,4.574193548387097

4185144,4,B003RHZ6CK,"I recommend this show on several interesting points.

1. It's from the creators of Columbo, a show I absolutely love (and have written ebooks about; see shameless plug below).
2. Jim Hutton (Timothy's dad) who stars in the show; he's good, and, sadly, died of liver cancer a few years after.
3. The parade of 1) famous guest stars and 2) people who were also on Columbo (see item #1, above)
4. It reverses the Columbo model and goes ""classic mystery"" on us: we don't know whoddunit
5. Some creative elements, such as ""breaking the fourth wall"" prior to the reveal.
6. It only ran one season!!

OK, it's a pretty basic, formula detective show. The murder ... a slew of suspects ... Simon Brimmer -- each and all are the same every time.

But that's kinda yer basic TV thing, right? It's no Breaking Bad, but then -- what is? And the characters are well-developed within that stricture, and the episodes are fun, and go back and read the other six reasons.

Fun to watch, and re-watch, since by then you own it ...

4185173,5,B003RHZ6CK,"While four television shows bore the name of Ellery Queen, one incarnation is the undisputed best. The series starred Jim Hutton as Ellery Queen with David Wayne as Inspector Richard Queen.

Hutton first played the master detective in the 1975 Telefilm, Too Many Suspects which then led to a 22 episode run in the 1975-76 series.

The series was set in Post-War New York City with Ellery as a mystery writer often called in by his father on various cases. Only one suspect ever cried foul on this odd process.

The mysteries are well-written and well-crafted and very traditional, trying to provide a sense of fair play and usually succeeding. Though in one case, The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne, I don't think anyone could have come up with a proper solution based on what was shown on TV. Still, following the tradition of the book and the golden age radio series, before the solution was revealed, Ellery issued his challenge to the viewers to see if they could solve the case.

There was great chemistry between Hutton and Wayne who made a solid and believable team, and played off each other beautifully.

In the majority of episodes, Queen wasn't the only one trying to solve the case. He had a rival who was also collecting clues, sharing some findings with Ellery and hoping to come to a conclusion. Several times he faced off with the Suave and sophisticated Simon Brenner (John Hillerman) who was a criminologist who played himself on the radio but also tried to solve real life mysteries. Hed come up with very clever and well thought out solutions that always turned out to be wrong. When Brenner wasn't around, resourceful newshound Frank Flannigan (Ken Swofford) would often try to solve the case from right under the polices nose.

The program featured an embarassment of riches when it came to its guest stars. Adding to the 1940s atmosphere, many great stars of the Golden Age radio appeared in the series including George Burns, Dana Andrews, Don Ameche, Lloyd Nolan, Rudy Vallee, Vincent Price, and Arthur Godfrey. In one episode, Eve Arden (best known for Our Miss Brooks) played the star of a radio soap who was murdered. Beyond the radio stars, such classic TV and film stars such as Ken Berry, Eva Gabor, Tom Bosley, and Bob Crane featured.

The series did a good job capturing its era with the vehicles, the cultural references, and the overall feel although it did occasionally deal with issues that were emphasized less during the era itself such as payola. Some of the portrayals of how radio drama worked were more played for comedic value than for realism. Still, this was a very wonderful period series.

Unfortunately, the series was cancelled after a single season, losing its time slot consistently to ABCs Streets of San Francisco. Despite how well beloved by fans, it faced two challenges.

The 1970s was a great era for the TV detective, similar to the late 1940s for radio detectives. Ellery Queen began airing in the era of Columbo, McCloud, Mcmillan and Wife, Rockford, Kojak, Canon, and Barnaby Jones. However, its period feel and strict puzzle story format made it different from its competitors but perhaps they were too different.",1435881600,,3173,4.828729281767956

Ellery gets involved in the cases his father is investigating and, of course, helps solve them. I don't understand how this show only lasted one season! Jim Hutton & David Wayne are great as Ellery and his police captain father, and most of the one hour stories are fun trying to guess who the killer is.
 I've read that the people who created this show, also created Columbo and Murder She Wrote. One of the creators said that had Ellery Queen been successful they wouldn't have done Murder She Wrote.

Jim Hutton and David Wayne make this movie. It was created by the same people who gave us Columbo and Murder she Wrote. Both of these were big hits and for good reason. If only another net work had picked up Ellery Queen I believe it would have been as big a hit as Columbo and Murder she Wrote at least for the second season. The untimely death of Jim Hutton would have been the end I feel for no one could have replaced him. I can remember only one show, or movie, where a change of main actors was a success. That was the ""Charlie Chan"" movies of the 30s and 40s. Again the untimely death of the leading man, Oland, was replaced by Toler who picked up where Oland left off and the show remained a hit until Toler's death. I sure  would have loved to seen at least one more season of Ellery Queen. I loved the mid 40s setting. Everything about this show was perfect. I guess we should be thankful for the one season.",1417910400,,1079,3.9953703703703702

And there is a real fun aspect to the show as ALL of the clues necessary to solve the mystery one's self are there if one simply watches and listens closely.  They are not easy to solve, though, even if you do listen and, yes, replay parts.  There are some very subtle things that my wife and I do miss and we get it wrong.  It is a unique show in the respect that you CAN solve it your self and are given a chance to do so.  Pretty cool to us.",1403827200,,663,3.9473684210526314
4185296,5,B003RHZ6CK,"This series proves my point about people in charge. When this was on tv it had 20 million viewers watching it but the people it charge cancelled it, they had the great, brilliant idea to use unused ellery queen scripts to launch the eddie capra mysteries with vincent bagetta. Also, as a reviewer said period tv series are expensive. If that was the reason for cancellation why were the waltons on s  o  l  o  n  g? Also, in an interview Mr. Dannay said that Jim Hutton reminded him of a younger version of himself. I would say that was a seal of approval, wouldn't you?",1402704000,,570,4.339622641509434
4185297,3,B003RHZ6CK,"The Ellery Queen Mysteries is a TV show about a regular forty-something single guy in New York who writes mystery novels and lives alone with his also single father, a police inspector who brings his son along literally every time there's a murder to solve the crime for him. That's normal right? Nothing strange about any of that at all.

I've been curious about The Ellery Queen Mysteries ever since I read creator Peter S. Fischer's book Me and Murder, She Wrote (which is SUCH a great book btw). In it, he talks about several series he created or worked on, including Murder, She Wrote, Columbo, and a few you probably don't remember (like The Law and Harry McGraw or Blacke's Magic). There's a special place in his heart, though, for The Ellery Queen Mysteries, which Fischer recalls fondly throughout the book while expressing continued confusion as to why the show wasn't more popular. After watching the series on DVD, I think I know why.

It's not that the show is terrible--it has a lot of great elements which make it fun and watchable--but it definitely has some problems. The premise--that writer Ellery Queen solves murder cases better than his police inspector father can--might be straight from the books, but the TV series makes it seem like his father is the world's absolute worst detective. It's not that he's portrayed as bumbling (quite the opposite--David Wayne is very gruff and direct) so much as that he has no idea what he's doing. Whenever there's a murder he literally panics until someone goes to get his son. His son the writer, not the police officer. It stretches the very limits of belief.

I'm also not a fan of the fourth-wall-breaking moments when Jim Hutton as Ellery Queen speaks directly to the camera saying, ""I've figured it out. Have you?"" That almost never works out as well as TV and movie creators want it to. Suddenly I feel like I'm watching a children's detective show with the host saying, ""Hey kids, did you figure it out?""

The series was only based on the Ellery Queen stories in the most basic ways (only one or two episodes even credit Queen, the rest being original scripts using the same characters) so you're not likely to find your favourite books or short stories depicted. It does stay true to the ""fair play mystery"" aspect of Ellery Queen stories, in that all the clues you need to solve the mystery at home are given and shown. Of course, they rather hit you over the head with that point. And the answer to almost every single one is that the murderer left before the victim was really dead, giving the victim a few seconds to leave a ""dying clue,"" some cryptic indication of who the killer is (no one ever uses those last seconds to call for help or try to stop their own bleeding).

Still, there's something inviting about the show. It takes place in the 1940's but was made in the 1970's, which means that it feels very 70's. What was it about the 1970's that compelled people to make period dramas in which everybody wore polyester and shiny blue eyeshadow? And the odd relationship between father and son is sort of like a detective duo version of Sanford and Son. Plus there's the added mystery of how 5'7 David Wayne managed to have a son as tall as 6'5 Jim Hutton. How tall was the mom supposed to have been??

But the chess-themed opening sequence and instrumental music draws you in. Get it? Because his name is Queen, like a chess queen? And he solves difficult puzzles, sort of like playing chess. Yeah, the show doesn't go much for subtlety. But I'm glad I watched them. I could almost hear Peter S. Fischer in the background saying, ""I love this show! Why isn't anyone watching it?""

This review first appeared on my blog, Murder She Watched, a mystery-themed offshoot of Cozy Little Book Journal, and is based on the Ellery Queen Mysteries DVD set that I borrowed from my local library.",1402617600,,3866,4.61863173216885

Jim Hutton provides a great performance as this quirky detective.  I love the relationship between  him and his father , played by the actor David Wayne.

Jim Hutton is as cute as a button.
There is fabulous fashion from the '40's as conceived by '70's costume designers.
Over-plucked eyebrows and frosty eyeshadow.
John Hillerman as a snarky radio shock-jock.
Every single TV star of the period makes an appearance.
Dr. Joyce Brothers is a murder victim - yes, really!
Mix it all together with wacky story lines, goofy dialogue and Jim Hutton - did I mention how cute he is? - and you've got several hours of light, fluffy entertainment. Mix yourself a Manhattan and enjoy.",1388966400,,544,4.7368421052631575
4185325,1,B003RHZ6CK,"Not much to say except if you liked the books, avoid this series.  These episodes make the movie Clue seem deep and challenging.  Everything is reduced to shameless mugging and overly explained exposition.  Casting famous stars in key roles didn't help, although I'm sure it was done that way so that the audience might not notice the lack of plot and fundamental absence of mystery.  I can't believe I enjoyed these when I was younger, but of course when they came out I was a mere toddler.......",1388188800,4,497,4.67816091954023

4185330,5,B003RHZ6CK,"This series is so much fun to watch, everything about it feels ""Mystery""; the music, the era, the ambiance, and best of all, when towards the end Ellery looks at the camera and asks if you know ""who done it""? Jim Hutton was the perfect Ellery Queen, although seemingly absentminded extremely sharp minded, you can almost see the wheels turning in his head! Another excellent choice, David Wayne as Ellery's dad, although pretty laid back keeps a sharp eye on his witty son, (Ellery, just focus), together they are a great team. Extra great additions to this series; John Hillerman as Simon Brimmer, so fitting in his role as a radio star with an extra large ego, Ken Swofford as Frank Flannagan the newspaper hound who you want to dislike but cannot. It would have been nice if these two characters were in more of the episodes. These mysteries are pretty family friendly, especially if you are all mystery hounds. Very fun to watch, I highly recommend this all too short series.",1385683200,,979,4.6976744186046515

I'm a big Agatha Christie fan and watch all the PBS productions of Miss Marple and Poirot so I figured this series just wouldn't measure up to the quality of those shows but it does!

The reason the gangster boss went to that one club is because he liked the food. Sometomes,a cigar is a cigar. Bibi Besch performance was outstanding !!",1384387200,,452,4.524390243902439

Now that I'm retired I picked it up in hopes it was another ""Columbo"" or maybe close. It isn't, but it does have it's charm. Ellery Queen books & magazine stories must have been full of ""dead man clues"" because this series boast a number of them none of which are particularly intriguing and some down right absurd. You get to guess the killer along with Jim Hutton (as Ellery) but in most cases you won't because.......well I'll let you judge that for yourself.
Ellery Queen was a one year series so you can move through the series rather quickly and as I said it has it's charm; good supporting cast , unique format & chance to see Jim Hutton in action. Jim was not with us long but his talent remains. I can help but think that son Tim's series, ""Nero Wolf,"" was a silent tribute to his father.",1374192000,,939,4.280898876404494

4185361,4,B003RHZ6CK,"The major problem with this series is that it lacked the feel of the 40's when it was supposed to have taken place. This could have been a wonderful period piece with the film noir feel, but instead it seemed stuck with 60's hairdos and 50's clothes. Ellery should have been more in the character of Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe instead of a man working hard to be a beatnik. This show would have been excellent in the creative direction of Timothy Hutton who did one of the amazing period pieces and one of the best detective shows on TV-Nero Wolfe.  Perhaps Timothy learned a great deal about what should be done with period pieces by watching his father in the Ellery Queen Mysteries.",1372896000,,686,4.488

Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Not only did it hold up, but it was a breath of fresh air. I watched the first episode and did not hesitate to purchase the entire series. I've had many a fun evening, after dinner, relaxing with Ellery, Inspector Queen and Sgt. Velie. I think at this point I've watched each episode at least 3 times. Great for a cold rainy night, with the lights out, curled up under a blanket with a cup of hot cocoa.

4185550,5,B003RHZ6CK,"""In a few minutes, this man is going to be murdered. Who killed him? Was it his son? The faithful secretary? Her fianc? The cheating business partner? The needy nephew? The gold-digger? Match wits with Ellery Queen, and see if you can guess Who Done It!""

Whether due to ratings, the high cost of a weekly show set in the 1940s or star Jim Hutton's failing health, 1975's Ellery Queen only lasted a single season, but that at least meant the show never went into the kind of decline long running mystery shows inevitably run into as they run out of plots. As it is the show relies heavily on the same plot twist - the murder victim almost always leaves a dying clue to the murderer's identity while an unrelated example of Ellery's absentmindedness will give him the key to the mystery - that becomes almost as much of a gimmick as Queen breaking the fourth wall to address the audience and recap the clues before revealing whodunit. But the show still has fun with its conventions, throwing in knowing jokes about assembling all the suspects to reveal the killer and even allowing Ellery's father to come up with the guilty party in one episode and for the most part it plays fair and doesn't hide the evidence you need to solve the case yourself.

At the heart of the show is the real easygoing chemistry between Jim Hutton and David Wayne as the likeable crime writer and his police commissioner father and a good cast of occasional supporting characters like John Hillerman's wonderfully supercilious radio mystery host always trying to gazump Ellery's cases or Ken Swofford's gossip columnist as well as Tom Reese's reliable cop to do the heavy lifting. They're complimented by a very impressive array of guest stars from old and new Hollywood, some effectively cast against type (Ken Berry turns in a surprisingly good dramatic performance in one episode that's a world away from his usual loveable idiots), most doing exactly what you'd expect: the roll call includes Vincent Price, Ray Milland, Walter Pidgeon, Don Ameche, Dana Andrews, Jim Backus, Eddie Bracken, Victor Buono, George Burns, Joan Collins, Troy Donahue, Mel Ferrer, Rhonda Fleming, Farley Granger, Larry Hagman, Kim Hunter, Carolyn Jones, Robert Loggia, Ida Lupino, Roddy McDowall, Vera Miles, Juliet Mills, Sal Mineo, Dorothy Malone, Lloyd Nolan, Donald O'Connor, Cesar Romero, Barbara Rush, Dean Stockwell, Susan Strasberg, Rudy Vallee, Dana Wynter among many other familiar character actors stretching back to the 30s. It has great production values too, with a surprisingly lavish recreation of 40s New York that may rely heavily on Universal's old props and costumes but always looks good even if half of the murder victims seem to live in the same house.

It's a fun, genuinely good natured and highly enjoyable show, deftly made without becoming twee or too self-parodic, it's 22 episodes having many of the virtues of superior examples of the kind of programmers that the studio turned out on their better days in the era the show is set in, and thankfully the DVD gives them a decent showcase. Picture quality is good in the original fullframe ratio - no gratuitous cropping for widescreen TV here - with an 18-minute interview with producer William Link and a booklet as extras.

The old days in Singapore, TV programs (like Ellery Queen) was a luxury; and I did not have the opportunity to watch the entire series.  But if it was aired, I would be glued to the tv set.  Of course, my elder sister would sit with me to explain what's going on.....I was in my early teens but love Ellery Queen...both the novel and TV series.

30++ years passed and still remember the opening music from the series.  That is why I bought the DVD set. Needles to say, to catch up episodes that I have missed.... I am sure I will still enjoy them.

From the opening strains of Elmer Bernstein's cheeky theme music to the closing titles I'm caught: even if I remember who did it, the ins and outs of the plot and the acting are a joy to watch, as well as the tremendous recreation of an era. And on top of that the quality of the images and sound are excellent, much better than anything I expected.

For movie buffs / radio fans / EQ fans: listen for the sly references to entertainment milestones of the era. They're there in almost every episode!

As the classic theme song plays, I am taken back to a kinder and gentler time, when TV was not afraid to be nice and perhaps tickle a few brain cells.

I love a good mystery, and when the acting and writing is good, it can be a winner. But I've seen the first three episodes, so far, and I find it very pathetic that the chief of police, Queen's dad, HAS to use his son to solve every murder investigation. It makes Queen's dad look so stupid. Wished that element was eliminated. What I do like about it, and the reason I gave it 3 1/2 stars, is because of all the grand actors they were able to utilize for this series. A lot of them have become very famous, but I also recognize many famous character actors I've seen in different series over the years.

4185593,4,B003RHZ6CK,"Running for just one season, the television series Ellery Queen Mysteries (1975-76) was based on the fictional detective Ellery Queen, and was produced by William Link and Richard Levinson, the same team responsible for Columbo, and later Murder She Wrote.  The DVD set of the complete series (Ellery Queen Mysteries) contains the series pilot, Too Many Suspects, and 22 one hour episodes, on six discs.  This set contains just four of those twenty-two episodes on a single disc.

The series was set in New York City, beginning in 1946.  The casting was simply stellar, as Jim Hutton (The Green Berets) and David Wayne in the lead roles, had wonderful chemistry together.  Hutton was marvelous as Ellery Queen, a writer of mystery novels, with some odd personality quirks.  Ellery shared an apartment with his father Inspector Richard Queen (Wayne), the NYPD's chief of detectives.  It was through this connection, that the younger Queen often became involved in bizarre and challenging cases, mostly involving the upper crust of society.  The cast also included Queen's muscular right hand man, Sergeant Velie (Tom Reese).  Ken Swofford was slick reporter Frank Flanagan.  And a pre-Magnum P.I. John Hillerman was the uppity detective Simon Brimmer, host of the radio program The Casebook Of Simon Brimmer, who often attempted to match wits with Ellery.

The selection of the episodes is bit odd, as it includes the first two episodes, and the last two episodes in the series.

The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne (Episode 1):  A wealthy man is found murdered on New Year's Eve, 1946, at party attended by Inspector Queen and Sgt. Velie, being held at the Hotel Astor in New York.  With a ballroom full of suspects in attendance, Queen seals off the hotel to question everyone.  Ellery battles cross town traffic, and an angry girlfriend, to get to the hotel and come up with the vital clue.  The guest cast includes Joan Collins, David Doyle, Herb Edelman, Farley Granger, Guy Lombardo, Karen Machon, Charles Knox Robinson, Barbara Rush, Ray Walston, and George Wyner.  Rating: 7 out of 10.

The Adventure of the Lover's Leap (Episode 2):  A wealthy heiress is found outside her home, having apparently fallen to her death.  Just prior to her death, she had been reading one of Ellery's books.  Fiction and fact run together in this episode that features the first appearance of Simon Brimmer (John Hillerman) demonstrating his flair for the dramatic.  The guest cast includes, Don Ameche, Anne Francis, Jack Kelly, Ida Lupino, Craig Stevens, and Susan Strasberg. Rating: 8.

The Adventure of the Hardhearted Huckster (Episode 21): An abrasive executive for a cigar company is found murdered in his office, and his staff are the chief suspects.  Ace reporter Frank Flannigan (Ken Swofford) gets his feet wet in the new medium of television, hosting a program where Ellery solves the case during a live broadcast.  The guest cast includes Eddie Bracken, Bob Crane, Herb Edelman, Carolyn Jones, and Juliet Mills.  Rating: 10.

The Adventure of the Disappearing Dagger (Episode 22): A close friend of Inspector Queen, who is investigating an old case, is murdered.  The Queens try to solve the murder, and also discover what happened in the original case, which  involves a murder on an airplane.  This is one of the best episodes in the series.  The guest cast includes Gary Burghoff, Ronny Cox, Mel Ferrer, Walter Pidgeon, and Dana Wynter.  Rating: 10.

Near the end of each episode after all the clues have been revealed, Jim Hutton would break character and directly address the audience, reviewing key points and asking the audience if they knew the solution to the case.  Extremely well-written, the Ellery Queen Mysteries is great fun for lovers of classic whodunits.  The relationship between the two Queens is a key element, and David Wayne plays a great straight man to his eccentric and absent minded son.  The stories are compelling, and very rewatchable.  The presence of Frank Flanagan, and the snooty Simon Brimmer, adds some humor, and helps to keep things lively.  The program was a showcase for many well known stars of the era.  This four episode collection provides a decent sampling of the series at a pretty good price, although you do get a much better deal purchasing the entire series.

Jim Hutton, was a very talented actor, who somehow never landed the leading roles he probably should have.  At six foot five, and with a likeable onscreen persona, he was often cast in supporting roles.  Hutton, the father of actor Timothy Hutton, passed away from cancer in 1979, at the age of 45.  Highly recommended to mystery and detective story lovers, The Ellery Queen Mysteries provides an opportunity to see this gifted performer, doing some of his best work.",1310256000,3,4774,4.982300884955753
4185594,5,B003RHZ6CK,". . .but then no non-literary presentation ever has, not even the radio dramas scripted by Ellery Queen themselves.

That said, I watched this show religiously when it first aired, and was ecstatic to find the DVDs to replace my sadly decaying VCR tapes.

Jim Hutton is utterly adorable as Ellery and the chemistry between him and David Wayne is extraordinary - much like the chemistry between Ray Walston and Bill Bixby in 'My Favorite Martian.'

The show is cerebral - not at all humorless, as the humor arises from the characters and the witty writing - no guns, no car chases, no explosions. Just a good solid puzzle and some good solid ratiocination.

Why is a one-season failure getting a DVD release? Well, think. This show had 20 million viewers in 1976 and was considered a failure. LOST had 15 million at the top of its ratings and is considered a great success. TV has changed - up to 20 million people remember this show fondly. More 'failures' like this should find a home on DVD and download.

I was and still am  a huge fan of shows like Columbo, McCloud, McMillan and Wife, and Banacek; this show ranks up there with them and I throughly enjoyed melting into an inert puddle one weekend while watching the DVD set. First of all, I had forgotten that the characters were set in post-WWII New York, and the atmosphere suited the mysteries extremely well. It was nice seeing detective work without DNA and the  hi-tech we are used to today, although sometimes Inspector Queen, and Ellery himself,  so grossly contaminated the crime scene that it is amazing Ellery didn't go off on all manner of wild goose chases. Yes, not all the stories were particularly realistic or plausible but I wasn't that bothered by that- it was fun seeing Jim Hutton and the constant parade of highly recognizable guest stars in action. The breaking of the fourth wall at the end of each episode was something I  remembered well, and still enjoy. The quality of the DVD transfer was surprisingly good- I watched this on a bluray  player and a new HDTV and the images were quite sharp and clear.

This show has a kind of nifty theme song, by my favorite theme composer, Elmer Bernstein.
It actually involves the viewer in the plot. It ''breaks the fourth wall,''
(Jim Hutton talks to the camera near the end of each episode) which is something I find intriguing. It makes me think about it!

With Columbo, you sit back and guess.

4185603,5,B003RHZ6CK,"I was eighteen when the pilot movie for this series aired. As a 1940s and OTR buff, this series was tailor-made for me, not to mention that one of my favorite character actors, David Wayne, was portraying Inspector Richard Queen. Jim Hutton, who I was familiar with from THE GREEN BERETS and THE HORIZONTAL LIEUTENANT, played a loveable, absent-minded, but sharp Ellery. (I found out later that the Dannay/Lee families said that Hutton's portrayal was very close to the actual personality of one of the authors.) Week after week I would ""match wits"" with Ellery and try to guess the identity of the murderer. (I even kept score in my journal; alas, in the end Ellery ""out-sleuthed"" me.) I liked best the stories where knowing a certain word or concept would give you the clue to the killer's identity.

The guest cast was filled with delightful character actors, from the 1970s regulars of the ""Universal Studios repertory group"" as I called them, to veteran performers who went back to radio and vaudeville, like George Burns, William Frawley, Eve Arden, and Eddie Bracken, and all the 1940s settings and references were equally delightful. Along the way QUEEN satirized a number of subjects, such as Hollywood changing writers' scripts and the movie scene; addressed hot subjects of the 1940s, such as the early payola scandals and war crimes; and even presaged the comic book violence controversy of the 1950s.

A particular delight of the series was John Hillerman's portrayal of Simon Brimmer, an unctious radio mystery story star who fancied himself a sleuth. Brimmer would somehow always come up with the wrong suspect, only to be corrected by Ellery in the climactic scene. Indeed, radio stories played a part in several of the mysteries, and many times the wordplay of the structure of the episodes themselves harked back to radio. Ken Swofferd is also fun as Frank Flannigan, a bombastic hack reporter.

This is a nice, solid release of the series which includes the pilot film TOO MANY SUSPECTS. The episodes are sharp and crisp, with typical television sound of the time, which is not unpleasant. Definitely for classic mystery fans who don't mind a bit of whimsy, 1940s fans, and those who enjoy classic radio mystery stories.",1304294400,6,2239,4.949468085106383
4185604,5,B003RHZ6CK,"I was very pleased to learn that the Ellery Queen Mysteries were finally released on DVD and were available on Amazon at a reasonable price.

Great fun watching mysteries that weathered the test of time-- as the series was set in 1947, they were not ""dated"" from the '70's. Many, many guest stars populated the stories and the core cast of Jim Hutton, David Wayne, Tom Reese et al. were dead on representations of the fictional characters they portrayed. Very entertaining if you are a mystery fan and just want a fun diversion for an evening.

Shame the series was cancelled after only one season-- one review I read claimed the series was too cerebral because it challenged the viewer to guess who dun'it. Audiences of the day preferred the Columbo format-- that is, you knew who dun'it from the beginning of the show. Anywho-- I enjoyed Ellery Queen Mysteries then and I enjoyed seeing them again on DVD.",1304035200,3,907,4.69811320754717
4185605,4,B003RHZ6CK,"It's incredible that Ellery Queen did not have the longevity that Columbo and Murder She Wrote and a lot of the other mysteries shows had.  Ellery Queen had only one season and it was a first-rate show . . . it should have gone on and had the same longevity.

--William Link, producer of Ellery Queen

Ellery Queen may have only lasted for one season, but among those nearly two dozen episodes, it's impossible to find a clunker.

--Andrew Gulli, Managing Editor of The Strand

The answer to William Link's incredulity in the first quote is that the second one by Andrew Gulli just isn't true.  I wish it were.  But there were clunkers; and unfortunately, for the way television worked in the 1970's, the worst show fell at the worst possible time.

For decades you could count on the second episode of any new series to be terrible.  Conversely, the first was usually one of the best.  The reason for both was the same: time.  There was generally an open deadline in creating the first episode.  It was the pilot.  But if the network liked it enough, a series was ordered.  Now time was suddenly the enemy.  The next show, the first upon being picked up but the second to air, was done virtually on the fly.  And it almost always showed.  There was an exception to this rule, however: when the pilot was a two-hour movie.  Which brings us back to Ellery Queen.

After much advertizing, the audience that tuned in that Thursday night in 1975 found the character for whom the series was named bumbling across New York City, trying to find his way to the scene of a New Year's Eve murder, where his father, a NYPD inspector, desperately awaited his help.  Ellery solved the murder almost upon arrival, and it didn't matter whether the solution was brilliant or ordinary.  We had wasted an hour following this buffoon.  Not the ideal introduction.

It grossly misrepresented the series.  Link was correct in his self-assessment above: it was a first-rate show.  And its strength from the beginning was casting.  Jim Hutton was the perfect Ellery Queen.  David Wayne, while hardly a talented actor, fit the role as Inspector Richard Queen well.  I liken him to Ray Walston as Judge Henry Bone in Picket Fences; the character's eccentricities happened to match the actor's posturing.  Ellery's foils were also well-played: Ken Swofford as boisterous newspaperman Frank Flannigan and John Hillerman as the prim and arrogant radio host Simon Brimmer.  In fact, I have always believed Hillerman's work here got him his most famous role, as Higgins on Magnum, P.I.  I believe just as much that Jim Hutton's performance as Doug Selby--Erle Stanley Gardner's other, almost-unknown series character--in the TV movie They Call It Murder earned him his shot at Ellery.

And then there were the guest stars.  At worst they were competent.  Some were brilliant.  But almost always they were good, solid.  And some surprises, performances you would not expect from the people who gave them.  I have to be vague here because the best performances in a mystery are inevitably the confession, and I won't give that away.

And that's why you'll never hear me complain that a suspect confessed too easily.  I want to hear the confession.  ""Why"" is as important as ""who"" and ""how"" to me.  If you agree then you'll enjoy ""Lover's Leap,"" ""Miss Aggie's Farewell Performance,"" ""Wary Witness"" and ""Tyrant of Tin Pan Alley.""  Unfortunately, the vital clue in the last of these listed is so obvious that I spotted it as a thirteen-year old back in 1976.  Doesn't spoil the ending, though.

And in that vein, ""Pharaoh's Curse"" is pretty obvious and you'll figure out ""Caesar's Last Sleep"" at the same time as the Queens do.  But in most cases you won't.  And not because they're particularly ingenious.  It was simply a near-impossible task to fairly present all the evidence in a way that the audience could retain it and still not recognize it for what it was.  The clues are all there.  Ellery even points them out to you when he breaks the ""fourth wall"" right before the solution.  But you won't slap your head and exclaim, ""It was so obvious!""  That's not to say there aren't episodes like that.  Just not a lot of them.

And that's okay.  Because it's the trip that counts here.  And the characters and the performances will carry you along.  You will be entertained.  Particularly with ""Too Many Suspects,"" ""Colonel Nivin's Memoirs,"" ""Mad Tea Party,"" ""Sinister Scenario,"" ""Two-Faced Woman,"" ""Hardhearted Huckster,"" ""Disappearing Dagger,"" and ""Veronica's Veil.""

I list ""Veronica's Veil"" last because it is a favorite.  First of all it features George Burns as a murder victim who still manages to deliver a monologue at his own funeral.  And it also gives exposure (in more than one way) to Barbara Rhoades, one of two sex symbols of my childhood that time has forgotten.  (The other is Melinda Naud.)  And finally it contains a nice solution and a solid confession.  Overall I feel it represents the best elements of the series: entertaining and fun with a fairly-presented mystery.

And to return to the guest stars for a moment, this was shot at a time when once established, an actor could make a decent living by guesting on various shows.  In a lot of instances these people died decades ago, and if you were around then--at whatever age--it's like revisiting old friends.  For me it was like that with: Ross Martin, Simon Oakland, Roddy McDowall, Forrest Tucker, Bob Crane and Vincent Price.

For that feeling, for characterization of Jim Hutton and Co, for the pure entertainment value, I consider Ellery Queen an unqualified success.

Starring Jim Hutton ( Timothy's Father ) and David Wayne, it has been restored to near HD perfection. The stories are well written and clever. In a nice twist to the usual detective show,at the beginning of each episode the viewer is invited to watch for clues in order to outwit Ellery Queen( Hutton ). Before the culprit is revealed, Ellery steps out of the scene and asks you if you have found the key clue that he found. To top it all off, the packaging is first class and thorough, with a synopsis booklet and background information on each episode and its stars, and there are Guest Stars galore in every episode which adds to the fun.

The quality of the DVD is very good, sound, visuals all fine.  So that leaves the actual content of the series to review.  I appreciate the pace, the turns and the plot lines in the series very much.  It isn't frantic or so overly dramatic as shows I experience today.  The characters are well developed and true.  The performances by the cameos are honest and involved.

Can't exactly say why but my son who watched the 1st episode with me has asked to see more shows.  I like that!",1302048000,,645,4.256198347107438
4185617,5,B003RHZ6CK,"The real mystery is why this outstanding series only lasted one season. Could it be because they did not realize how good the show was? The writing/producing team of Levinson & Link gave us so many notable shows beginning with MANNIX, moving on to another doozie, THE BOLD ONES, which lead to COLUMBO through their Broadway stage play PRESCRIPTION MURDER, to the infamous MURDER, SHE WROTE. They were aptly dubbed the Rolls Royce of the industry.

Needless to say, these guys know their stuff, and ELLERY QUEEN is up there with the great ones produced by this talented team. Jim Hutton gives his role a soft touch with his Einstein-like brain, touched off with an insatiable sense of humor, not to mention his good looks. The mood of the show is highlighted with a 1940s style faithfully represented with stylish wardrobe and extraordinary automobiles.

David Wayne, who plays Ellery's father, is a classic character actor who gives the show balance, and a sense of humor all his own, offset with his obvious love and admiration for his son.

The series is set with a plethora of fantastic guest actors, and good writing. I highly recommend it for hours of enjoyable entertainment. It is such a shame this show did not have a good run, but am thrilled to bits for the ones we have.",1302048000,,1281,4.709821428571429
4185618,5,B003RHZ6CK,"I fell for Jim Hutton after seeing ""Where the Boys Are.""  Have to admit I'm in my sixties, so this great actor and the work he did was a few decades ago. For those of you who remember him, and this series that he starred in, I strongly suggest you buy the set, not just for the great mystery stories that STILL hold up after all this time (1975-76 to be exact) but also for the ability to see some of your favorite actors from past eras, such as Troy Donahue, George Maharis, Vincent Price, and others. One of the fun parts of this series was when ""Ellery"" turns to the viewing audience and challenges them to solve the crime. He reminds you of some clues, and of course, unlike that viewing era, you can now stop the show and ponder his challenge before watching to the end. The series takes place in the later 1940's, so the cars, clothing, and way of life will be familiar only to those who have memory of the times. But for younger viewers, these mystery stories for me rank evenly with those currently running on the small screen.",1302048000,,1035,4.3076923076923075

He used to really love the old style ""Who done it?"" mysteries and this one actively invites participation. So, we would sit and argue (debate) our theories and see who was right. We loved it!
The series itself, is much as I remembered it. Kind of campy, with all the usual suspects. It is fun seeing some of these actors that I had not seen in years.

With the wonderful Jim Hutton as Ellery and the venerable David Wayne as Inspector Queen, it was a trip back in time once a week.  The chemistry between Hutton and Wayne is evident and adds to the fun quotient.  Yeah, it's a little bit ""70's television"" but a cut above the usual run-of-the-mill fare.  With music by Elmer Bernstein, period costumes and a little 40's film noir patois, it's fun stuff for those who enjoy mysteries.

4185627,4,B003RHZ6CK,"Nine years before Angela Lansbury's Jessica Fletcher started her 12-year run as a true-crime solving mystery writer in Murder She Wrote, Jim Hutton set the formula as Ellery Queen.

I fondly remember this show and its catchy theme music as a kid when its one season of 23 episodes ran in 1975 and 1976. It's nice to see the show finally on disc, but the 2010 DVD set includes no extras whatsoever. Set in New York in the late 1940's, Hutton's Ellery Queen is somewhat absent-minded, a successful mystery writer, and the son of a famous New York homicide detective played by David Wayne. Ellery is frequently called in ""unofficially"" to help solve crimes which baffle the police. Kinda makes one wonder how dad keeps his job and how Ellery gets any writing done. The chemistry between Hutton's Ellery and his on-screen dad is good, although their facial features aren't very similar and I have trouble believing the very tall Hutton is related to the very short Wayne. Wayne's age and his character's general veneer of gruffness remind me of Harry Morgan's Col. Harry Potter in M*A*S*H.

Likeable Hutton, who I first  discovered in the John Wayne film, Hellfighters, spends a lot of time scratching his head and acting like he's thinking really hard. It's sad to think that Hutton died at age 45 of liver cancer just four years after this series ended. A hallmark of the show is that at the end of every episode, Ellery ""breaks the fourth wall"" and talks directly to the TV audience, basically saying, ""now you have all the clues, have you figured it out yet?"" Like Murder She Wrote, each episode ends with a gathering of all the suspects where Ellery explains what the pertinent clues mean and exposes the murderer.

The show runs on a couple of recurring conceits - that murder victims almost always spend their dying breath trying to leave a cryptic clue as to the identity of their murderer, and once cornered, murderers always come clean and confess. To mix things up, Ellery has two would be crime-solving rivals who alternate in and out of the episodes. One is a smarmy crime show radio show host named Simon Brimmer, played by John Hillerman who went on to play Higgins in Magnum P.I. The other is a pithy reporter named Frank Flannigan played by Ken Swofford, who went on to play Mr. Morloch in the two-season TV version of Fame, as well as a slew of other television roles throughout the 70's, 80's , and early 90's. Ironically, both actors later played recurring roles in Murder She Wrote.

A lot of the fun of this show is seeing all the past and future stars who show up - George Burns, Joan Collins, Vincent Price, Larry Hagman, Dean Stockwell, Rene Auberjonois, Ed Mc Mahon, Ray Walston, Dick Van Patton, Jim Backus, June Lockhart, Betty White, Roddy McDowell (as a guy from New Jersey with a German accent no less), and many others. Chances are, if you don't know who any of these people are, this probably isn't your show. There's not a lot of action in Ellery Queen and the series relies on some moody skyline shots to remind viewers this show is set in the 1940s. Unfortunately, they use the same shots over and over and if you're watching the series back to back on disk, you'll get tired of seeing the same video footage again and again, as well as the same exterior shots of the brownstone where Ellery and his dad live. Overall, an entertaining diversion, but probably too dated for younger viewers.",1301875200,,3421,4.638613861386139

4185634,5,B003RHZ6CK,"I grew up in the 70s watching all of the current detectives' series such as Columbo and the Rockford files, but the Ellery Queen series was something different. It was set in the late 1940s, and the killer was not revealed until the last few minutes of the show. I liked it because the show actually made you think and pay attention, always challenging you to guess the identity of the killer before Ellery Queen did. It was a very intriguing and interesting show

That is not surprising, considering that The Ellery Queen series was created by Richard Levinson and William Link, who also wrote for Columbo, Mannix, and Murder, She Wrote.

The series began with a two-hour pilot that in March of 1975 was part of the NBC Sunday Mystery Movie, a revolving series of feature-length episodes of Columbo, McMillan & Wife, and McCloud. NBC then filmed 22 episodes and added it to their Fall schedule, but the show was cancelled due to low ratings. Which was a feat caused by the NBC network changing its days and viewing times around, and not because of any lack of quality or lagging interest in the series itself.

I was quick to buy this set at Barnes and Nobel when it became available in November of 2010, for about $45.00, and it compliments, very well, my previous purchase of the Nero Wolf  series from Amazon in October of 2009.

The series is similar to one of my all-time favorites: ""Burkes Law.""  Usually a very unlikeable character is killed at the beginning of the show.  There are numerous suspects played by various guest stars.  Ellery, a mystery novelist, usually gets involved due to his father N.Y. Police Inspector, Richard Queens, investigating the case.  Ellery is usually at a loss until (like Amos Burke,) someone says some innocuous thing that give him a clue into solving the mystery.  Ellery, as portrayed by Hutton, is sort of an idiot savant. He seems to live in a world of his own and  would forget his head if it wasn't on his shoulders, but he can figure out a mystery like nobody's business.  He is a man in the mid-40s who has no problem living with his Inspector father (well-played by David Wayne.)
The show takes place in New York in the late 1940s and portrays that era and locale very well.  The show also has a nice line-up of guest stars, (including the great Vincent Price in one episode,) who sadly, for the most part, are no longer with us.
The episodes are very nicely produced and enjoyable for a relaxing hour of mystery.  The dvd set includes an interview with one of the co-creators and producers, Richard Levinson who along with his late partner William Link created this series and many others (including ""Columbo."")
As stated previously, I never really cared for this series during its original 1 year run on NBC.  However, the nice thing with dvds are we get the chance to rediscover them again.  And I'm glad I rediscovered ""Ellery Queen.""",1297641600,4,1823,4.572307692307692

For those who haven't seen this program-""Maestro"" is the nickname Inspector Queen's able assistant, Sgt. Velie calls Ellery, and will do what Ellery asks at the drop of a hat!.  We don't always guess the murderer, but when Ellery ""breaks the fourth wall"", looks at the audience and reminds the people watching of the clues, the suspects and recaps about the victime, well, it is pure pleasure.

Our family recommends this series to anyone; it's a wonderful family program.  We've had hours of enjoyment with this series, and the fact that it is so family-friendly, it's terrific for a family movie night.  Enjoy",1294704000,5,1032,4.896551724137931

This is a TV series that disappeared long before its time. I never knew why. One seasion. And yet if you watch one episode the quality comes through. Jim Hutton and David Wayne are great as the father and son Sleuthing team. The people that guest star on this show are the best hollywood had to offer. But the show on DVD is perfect in the respect that you really have to pay attention to the show (Intently)to follow the mystery to the right conclusion, WHO DONE IT!. Here are 25 fantastic episodes for you to solve with no commercial interuptions. They look like they were shot yesterday and I'm pleased! You will be to.",1294531200,3,818,4.533783783783784

I could never understand why it had such a short series life. The quirky way Jim Hutton would turn to the viewer when he figured out who the killer was  and invited you to figure it out as you had been presented by the same clues he had seen was classic book style. It was a challenge and you tried to meet it.
Well worth the money spent.",1294185600,,589,3.9495798319327733

4185660,4,B003RHZ6CK,"I grew up watching this TV series, so I just had to have this boxed set.  Over the years, I forgot just how annoying the characters of Ellery Queen (a mystery book author played by Jim Hutton) and his dad (played by David Wayne) are.  They bumble their way through the evidence and the suspects and, even though his dad is a top level police official, it's always Ellery who solves the crime.  In any event, the storylines are good and the guest cast are recognizable.  Unlike ""Columbo,"" the viewer doesn't know who the killer is until the end of an episode.  And at some point during each episode, Ellery speaks directly to the viewer, such as asking if you've been able to identify the murderer.  Also, Ellery is not as cute or likeable as Lt. Columbo.

4185665,4,B003RHZ6CK,"I remember watching this show and being in love with Jim Hutton. OK, at the time, I was also in love with Davy Jones of the Monkees, and every other cute actor on TV. Whether to buy this DVD was a no-brainer, and watching the episodes again made we realize why I had a fascination with Mr. Hutton. He is still cute, and has that disorganized, but the mind is always working, way about him. The show is fair, in that it gives you all the clues, and if you are observant of the human condition, you have a fair shot of knowing who dun it. And realizing that if the police or Simon is sure it was someone, it wasn't! As an adult, watching the shows again, I can see the subtle hints and it's still fun to try to figure it out. If you liked the show when it was on, this is a DVD you'll enjoy. If you didn't watch it before, this DVD is a good mystery series that allows you to follow the clues and see if you can figure it out before the last act, when Ellery turns to the audience and asks if they have it figured out. If you like the Ellery Queen mysteries that start Ellery (which i started reading after seeing the show, way back when), then you'll love this series.",1293321600,,1167,4.0562770562770565
4185666,5,B003RHZ6CK,"This is a great series and every Mystery lover should own a copy.  Really i would just like to offer a suggestion to the co-creator of the series William Link.  Since we can never have a second season to this remarkable series, why not author a new book of Queen stories similar to the ""Columbo Collection,"" published earlier this year, which might give us an idea of how a second season would have looked?  Say a collection of
12-14 short stories?  Several fictional works of fiction are mentioned in the series such as, the adventure of the Golden Gargoyle, the adventure of the Purloined Gun and the adventure of the Lover's Leap. This might serve as a starting point, and i doubt with the exception of the two cousins, no one could write a Queen story better than William Link, well maybe Ed Hoch.  Still, it was through this series that i came to read and enjoy the Queen books which are sadly mostly out of print.  I think its time for a new one. A possible title?  Why not, The Adventure of the Golden Gargoyle and other stories, by Ellery Queen, as told by William Link!  Put me down for two copies today!",1293235200,3,1113,4.421568627450981

Ellery Queen (Jim Hutton) and Inspector Richard Queen (David Wayne) worked so well together.  They had a wonderful chemistry and you could see the enjoyment they took in working together.  The guest stars were great actors and actresses as well, investing their parts with all the angst and mystery they deserved.

The same team that brought COLUMBO and MURDER, SHE WROTE to television did ELLERY QUEEN.  It shows in the writing and the characterizations.  These are ""fair play"" mysteries, but that doesn't detract from the fun by any means; when Ellery Queen breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience, it's like being invited to play a game you didn't realize was going on.

The addition of subtitles (which I wish Amazon.com's DVD descriptions mentioned) makes it a great set to have so that everyone can enjoy it.",1292976000,4,1007,4.813953488372093

I enjoy reading Ellery Queen Mysteries on paperpack. It consists of several short stories and they all hold my attention. Unlike some mysteries Ellery Queen shows you who is going to be dead in a few minutes and who the suspects will be. After that the story unfolds. At the end of the show Ellery announces he has solved the murder and invites the audience to match wits with him and guess who the murderer is. I welcome the challenge and sometimes I am right and others I am surprised at who the murderer is. One nice thing included with this set is a booklet with pictures and information about the actors and the show. It lists all the episodes on each disc. Very few dvd sets have any paperwork let alone a booklet. It was a nice surprise.

4185691,4,B003RHZ6CK,"I have to say that I really like this release. I am over 50 years old now and was quite young when this show aired (weren't we all, though??) but my father loved it and every time I watched it, I was enchanted. As many others have said, Hutton and Wayne played off each other quite well and were very fun to watch. As I watch this series today, I get such a charge out of both the characters of Simon Brimmer and Frank Flanagan. Who was the better 'foil' for Ellery? Neither of them (to my knowledge) appeared in the books or the old radio show, and I think they add a fun touch to the series. Both are always trying to outguess Ellery and, of course, fail miserably. Brimmer was an arrogant elitist who considered himself an expert on crime detection merely because he played a detective on the radio, while Flanagan was a gossip-mongering reporter who always wanted to 'scoop' Ellery's latest case.

This was a very charming show and I don't quite know why it didn't last beyond a single season but, that's just my taste, I guess. I still find myself wondering who I really like better. Flanagan or Brimmer. But they were both fun.

As far as delivering a review, I think the packaging is okay (I give it 3 stars. The overlapping discs, while they save space on my library shelf, are a bit annoying) and there are no features to speak of other than a 22-page episode guide which merely rehashes each show. The show itself gets at least 4 stars from me and maybe even 5, I like it that much. I realize both Jim Hutton and David Wayne are gone now, but it would have been nice to have some sort of added features like interviews or thoughts or memories from some of the guest stars or perhaps some insight into the making of the show, but all in all, this is a very good package of a classic '70s TV show and I am happy with it. This is the best we Ellery fans will get, and I think it works well.

Beatrice was one of the stars of Happy Days as Marsha the Car Hop and also on the original Wonder Woman as Etta Candy Wonder Woman's girl friday.  As a working character actor of many years I have a great love of the nameless people who toil in films and TV shows, whose faces you recognize but whose names are not known.  When I was a kid growing up in Philadelphia I loved going to the movies to see, not the Duke or Randolph Scott but rather I looked forward to seeing Jimmy Gleason who was in over 400 pictures playing a variety of nameless fight managers, priests, hard boiled reporters etc.
One of the things that makes Ellery Queen so wonderful is the parade of guest stars, known and unknown, who bring a special charm to the proceedings.  Yes, Jim Hutton and David Wayne are marvelous but what makes this series so wonderful to watch is the roster of great guest stars in every episode including....well yes.....Beatrice Colen.

4185705,5,B003RHZ6CK,"I first watched ""The Ellery Queen Whodunit"" while still at school, in the 70s on BBC television, when VCRs were not so widespread and DVDs hadn't yet been invented. I was intrigued by its special feature, that near the end of the episode, the detective would turn to the viewers and challenge them to solve the mystery. Lacking a photographic memory and the ability to immediately process the relevant clues with a creative imagination, the prospects of success in most cases seemed slim.
I am very pleased that the series has come out at last on DVD, because it makes this enjoyment a realistic prospect at last. I would urge viewers to stop the DVD at the ""challenge"" when Jim Hutton as EQ breaks the fourth wall, and see the episode again, thinking about the clues and possible solutions, even a number of times, before moving on. By this, the enjoyment of the final solution, even the viewer does not find it, should be much enhanced.
The DVD set also has an informative interview with one of the creators of the TV series, William Link, an Ellery Queen fan himself.
Other welcome features are the pilot, ""Too many suspects"", effectively a double-length episode, just as good as the others. Also welcome are the teaser trailers with spinning question marks, which were not shown on the BBC.
The star, Jim Hutton had made a detective film earlier in 1970, ""They call it murder"", certainly worth seeing, but not as fine as this series. Sadly Hutton passed away in 1979, a few years after the series was released, so this DVD set will be a worthwhile part of his legacy.
One criticism of this particular edition is that the mystery movie theme of Henry Mancini has been substituted for the pilot film's original title music by Elmer Bernstein, which was an extended version of the one used for the episodes. Hopefully an edition containing the authentic theme will become available eventually, as well as on a soundtrack album on CD.
Minor criticisms could be made of the episodes. In one I felt that an essential clue (the fact of a blackmail) wasn't sufficiently explicit beforehand. In the ""challenge"" in another, in my view the word ""earlier"" would have been more appropriate than ""later"". Another involved a knowledge of American telephones of the 1940s, though this would not have been uncommon in the 1970s when the series was made. These episodes might be less suitable for ""EQ parties"" unless some commentary were provided, without giving the game away.
However, on the whole this must be one of the finest American detective series ever made for TV. Very highly recommended.",1288396800,,2585,4.798206278026906

4185707,5,B003RHZ6CK,"As a lifelong fan of Golden Age mystery writers, I count Ellery Queen as one of my favorite American authors, and I remember being thrilled when this show came out. Watching it again with a new perspective, I find it an interesting amalgamation of the ""old"" and ""new"" Ellery, yet it is a wholly original creation of the scriptwriters and actors who played these roles.

The character of Ellery Queen went through a complete transformation during his reign as the cousins who created him, Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee, began to allow their own political, social and spiritual concerns to pervade their writing. The early Ellery was a rather obnoxious fop, along the lines of S.S. Van Dine's Philo Vance, and the mysteries he solved were pure puzzling delights! Each book was titled after a different nationality (The Dutch Shoe Mystery, the Egyptian Cross Mystery, and on and on, including my very favorite, The Greek Coffin Mystery). In terms of puzzle alone, the TV series draws more on these early cases for inspiration, with stylized settings and characters and odd clues, including Queen's specialty, the dying message clue. It was in these early books that Queen issued his ""Challenge to the Reader,"" and Jim Hutton's Queen continues that tradition in the series.

Naturally, a 45 minute long television program cannot hope to create as complex a mystery as Queen's novels allow, so the characters tend to be thinly drawn and the clues minimal. I remember reading The French Powder Mystery, set in a NYC department store. During the denouement, which incorporated nearly one hundred pages, Ellery gathered the suspects together and sifted through what seemed like DOZENS of clues, accusing suspect after suspect until he narrowed in on the actual culprit. The TV mysteries are much more straightforward, and some are thinner than others, giving ample time (sometimes a little too ample) to the comical interactions between Ellery and his dad, or to the sneering misdirection of Simon Brimmer's theories. But the mysteries are great fun, for all the reasons that fans have stated: great guest stars, clever clues, and a willingness to include the audience in on the game.

It's interesting that the show is set in the post-war 40's because by then the authors had transformed Ellery from a high-handed twit to a real human being, troubled by the world around him, spiritually bereft, lonely for companionship and connected to his father by much more complex threads. On the one hand, their father/son bond was deeply drawn, warm and rich. But more often than not, Ellery resented his entry into crime-solving, as the cases began to take a much more emotional toll on the detective, the suspects, and even the killer at times. These mysteries are better written, if less clue-centered. They still play fair with the audience; some of them have terrific twists. But now Dannay and Lee are dealing with some really hard-hitting issues: post-traumatic stress disorder on returning soldiers, the unhappy willingness of society to embrace fascism, the question of the existence of a deity! Sounds like fun, no? But some of these later books are true classics: Calamity Town, The Murderer is a Fox, Cat of Many Tails, Ten Days Wonder, and so on.

None of the stuff of later works is present in the TV show, except for the warm filial bond of the Queens. It doesn't belong in this series, but I sure wish someone would consider dramatizing these later books. The one attempt at it, a TV movie based on Cat of Many Tails, was fairly mediocre due to the modernized setting and the miscasting of Peter Lawford as Ellery. I'd love to see a whole series based on the Wrightsville novels. (Wrightsville was the perfect small town of yesteryear that Ellery loved to visit when he needed to get away from the dirty city. Unfortunately, his arrival always - ALWAYS - heralded one or more murders. It's a wonder that the town didn't drive him out!!)

I've spoken more about the books than the series. I really am enjoying revisiting this show, but more than that, I hope it sparks a renewed interest in Ellery Queen the writer and that more mystery lovers will seek out his books.",1288310400,3,4172,4.8787023977433
4185708,4,B003RHZ6CK,"Having purchased this at a local ""wholesale club store,"" I was shocked to see it was the last box. I never thought it was all that popular, but I remember watching it as a kid.....and I could never figure out ""How Done It."" Well, I still can't, really, though you can, for the most part get the idea of what was happening and how they got to conclusion. For those who have not seen this, prepare yourself, because I don't think they used more than two cameras (how I miss the days when television was not about constantly flashing images in your face). The banter and interaction between the characters is excellent. The acting is on par (if not better) for the time. It may seem a bit over done now, however, this was a different time. I like the story line, as well as the implied violence. By that I mean that I like that they did not show the murders and violence, but rather left that to the viewers imagination. There was no need for graphic violence, etc.. Too bad it was such a short series.....it did not really hit its stride.

So, why 4 out of 5 stars? Well, I wasn't that impressed with the transfer quality. Playing them on my blu-ray, as well as my regular dvd players, (both of which upconvert), the image was not as crisp as I had expected, and in some places was just unacceptable for something that could have been easily remastered well. The sound quality is not bad, but could have been improved. None of these are deal breakers, and in fairness, I do not know what they had to work with. Also, nothing is THAT bad to make them deal-breakers. As for the disc holders, well, I have to say, I'm not thrilled with having one disc sit overlapped on another, and am wondering exactly how much it saved them (if anything). Lastly, I would love to have seen outtakes. There really isn't much in the way of bonus material, etc. If you liked the old televesion program, you will love this. If you watch a lot of present day programming, you probably will not enjoy this, mainly because of how it was originally shot....of course, this is could be used as a way to help hone attention span. ;-)",1287878400,4,2104,4.381074168797954
4185709,5,B003RHZ6CK,"Of all the crime dramas I've ever watched, none top this show. Jim Hutton, who unfortunately became ill after the first and only season, played the perfect non-detective. I'm sure this series inspired the creators of shows like Castle to have a mystery writer help solve cases. The regular cast, Hutton, Wayne, Reese and last but not least Hillerman, had an incredible chemistry. However, unlike shows like Castle, you were drawn in to try and figure out the mystery...not just watch and see what happens. Any fan of television mysteries needs to add this to their collection.

Now we have a professionally done version.  ""Ellery Queen"" is without doubt the most entertaining mystery series EVER.  Jim Hutton plays Ellery as a somewhat bumbling but still ""sharp as a tack"" detective.  But what do you expect from the team who would later create ""Columbo""?  David Wayne plays inspector Richard Queen, Ellery's police inspector father.  An especially entertaing feature of this series is (toward the end) Ellery looks at the audience and says, ""OK, you have all the clues.  Do you know who did it?  Stay tuned and let's see.""  The series is set in late 1940's New York, and the authentic costumes, scenes, and mannerisms are really captivating, especially when one character says of television,""It's that new-fangled gimmick that will NEVER catch on.  Don't waste your time.""  There are many guest stars including Betty White, Ed MacMahon, and Guy Lombardo who plays himself.  This is a real fest of entertainment.  It's too bad it only lasted one season, but then Link sand Levinson went on to create ""Columbo"".  Bottom line, get ""Ellery Queen"", you won't be sorry.",1287792000,,1251,5.004854368932039

Often times I was wrong, but just watching and trying to catch the killer made the show very fun to watch. When he turned to the camera and asks you if you have it figured out, you knew the chase was over and the answer would soon be there.

Let's not forget to mention the supporting actors, director and writers whose many talents when combined make the stories live and breathe. Unique to the show was the audience's participation for they were challenged to solve the mystery at home - before Ellery wrapped up the case. It was different and it was fun!

4185713,4,B003RHZ6CK,"I was only 14 when this show first aired and I loved it and was able to solve half of the stories so I don't know what the problem was with the two dissenting reviewers, one of whom thinks knowing the motivation is necessary for solving the case rather than clues.  Yes, a few episodes did not entirely play fair.  Every series has a few weak stories.
Among the best are ""The Mad Tea Party"", ""Miss Aggie's Farewell"", ""The Comic Book Crusader"", ""Veronica's Veils"" and ""The Two-Faced Woman"".  ""THe Tyrant of Tin Pan Alley"" was very good as well  but easy to solve long before Ellery.
Jim Hutton and David Wayne were great as Ellery and Inspector Queen, while Tom Reese was just right for Velie.  John Hillerman was marvelous as the pompous Simon Brimmer, and most of the guests were great as well.  There were some picky mistakes with the 1947 setting, such as having a suspect sing ""Mona Lisa"", which wasn't written until 1949.
One curious thing with the credits - ""Auld Lang Syne"" does not list the familiar face of Thayer David as playing the victim, yet ""The Pharoah's Curse"" credits the then unknown John Larroquette in his bit part as a bellhop.
I did have a sticking problem with disc 5 - I had to forward past a stuck scene on one, the other episode continued on its own after a slight pause.
NBC made a big mistake in not renewing it, or at least making it the fourth wheel in their Sunday Night Mystery Movie, where the longer running time would have made for tighter plotting and better suspect development.",1287100800,12,1516,4.494545454545454

4185715,5,B003RHZ6CK,"Ellery Queen, the well known mystery writer, knows a ""dying clue"" when he sees one.  What is a ""dying clue""?  If you have just been stabbed or shot, wouldn't you like to leave a clue to the identity of your killer before you take your last breath.  You can't count on paper and pen being handy, you will have to improvise with whatever is in reach ...

Sometimes a ""dying clue"" seems obvious, but it can easily lead you astray.  It may seem to point to one suspect, when it actually points to another or it may point to more than one suspect.  Worse yet, although it is an obvious ""dying clue"", it doesn't appear to point at any suspects.  And, worst of all, sometimes there appears to be no ""dying clue"".

These episodes make a great mystery game:  Before watching an episode, write down the suspects from the opening narrative; these narratives are also printed in the included reference guide.  Take notes of your observations, what you hear, and any conclusions you may draw as you watch.  Near the end of each episode, Ellery will look you in the eye and ask if you know whodunit.  If you don't know, replay it to see what you missed.  Once you think you know, then play the ending.

4185716,5,B003RHZ6CK,"If you weren't around in the early 70's. NBC had mysteries everywhere, from Columbo, McCloud , McMillan and Wife, Banachek and other shows. Ellery Queen filled the quota for mystery.

 I never understood why the show failed to have a second season. Its production value and quality  is up there with the other mystery shows. Jim Hutton, thats Leverage's Tim Hutton's Father, is likeable as Ellery Queen. David Wayne is Inspector Richard Queen. Peter Fisher, Levinson and Link created this show like they did future hit Murder She Wrote for CBS. The actor preform well and make this show likeable. The guest Stars each week  were like Love Boat, a who's who of show business. The Mysteries were well thought out.

In many ways I assume that this show was a thinking man's shows and most on Sunday Nights wanted either fluff or 60 Minutes..and this show was neither.

Now on DVD, mysteries audiences can savor this stylist show with the cleanest master recorders. Since this show never went to syndication, it seems uncut from the original shows.

Hutton played Ellery without being a tough hard pulp detective. His gentle touch sometime is stronger then the harder muscle (AE action shows) that was and still is the future of TV.

After viewing all the episodes. I still wonder why it did not have a second season on TV. Many should thank E1 Entertainment for unearthing this TV classic to DVD. This 35 year old show from the vault entertains and amazes.

So if you want go family entertainment that will engages the mind, this is it

Thus each episode of Ellery Queen features former film stars like Ray Milland, Dorothy Malone, Don Ameche, Rhonda Fleming, Howard Duff, Ida Lupino, and Eve Arden, and those of 50's and 60's TV series like Monte Markham, Anne Francis, Linda Day George, Larry Hagman and others.

I found some of the characterizations rather wooden and 2-dimensional.  Since I know that most of the cast were veteran actors, I felt a little embarrassed for them at first, but after viewing several of the episodes it became apparent to me that they had been directed along this mode of expression; almost a caricature or cartoon presentation.  The whole seemed a parody of the 1930s film noir gangster pictures, which I'm sure, was intentional.  If it seemed unnatural to me without introspection, I suspect it will definitely seem so to younger viewers unfamiliar with that period in the history of cinema.  Just give it a chance.

The series is rather dated, not by its fictional 1947 NYC venue but by its very 1970s style and presentation.  This is delightful for those of us who were young in the 70's as it lends a double dose of nostalgia, since many of us were born in the 40's, grew up in the 50's and 60's and went to college in the 60's and 70's.  Most of the older cast is recognizable because they were our parents' generation and the others were from our own.

The series does a marvelous job of capturing the culture and technology of the 1940's.  The Queen household, especially the kitchen, is highly evocative of the period.  I still remember some of the appliances and kitchen gadgets shown from my own childhood.  The pressure cooker sequence was very familiar, since my parents were the proud owners of one when I was in grade school, and my mother managed to produce some pretty impressive results with it.  I do remember worrying that it might explode, just as it did for Ellery, but my mother managed to keep it under control. The old TVs are also familiar to me, and I'm sure there really were those who thought TV was just a ""fad"" at the time!  Seeing the ""future"" in the sequence on computer run trains was particularly enjoyable.  It made one feel positively clairvoyant!  The old candlestick phones and their successors the black desk phones also took me back, since my grandparents had first the one and then the other when I was quite little.

The mysteries, some of them from original stories--though I don't recall any of them, despite having read most of them years ago--are mostly original works based on the Ellery Queen characters.  (""Ellery Queen"" is actually the pen name of a pair of authors, Dannay and Yaffe, who produced the original books.)  Most of the stories are very well plotted, with clues well placed and well hidden, so they are fair for the most part.  They don't rely on manipulation of character and plot at the end to make it come out right.  This was not always the case for some of the original books.  (I remember reading one in French and was upset by the abrupt changes made at the end to make it come out right, which reminded me that I'd already read the book in English years before and had felt the same way about it!) Some of the regular characters do a marvellous job of diverting the viewer's attention with their own ""brilliant deductions,"" showing that other answers are possible, just as is the case in some other mystery writer's creations.  The best example of this is Collin Dexter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Morse-Complete-Collection/dp/B000E1NWP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Morse - Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-First-Inspector-Morse-Omnibus-The-Dead-of-Jericho-Service-of-All-the-Dead-the-Silent-World-of-Nicholas-Quinn/dp/0330335588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The First Inspector Morse Omnibus: The Dead of Jericho, Service of All the Dead, the Silent World of Nicholas Quinn</a>.

""Ellery Queen"" and the novels of Agatha Christie cultivated my love for the mystery genre to this day - and AT LONG LAST it's brilliant to see the entire series in one boxed set on DVD, digitally remastered and looking even better than in their original airings on NBC!

And, after much speculation, I am so glad to see that the pilot film, ""Too Many Suspect,"" is included in the boxed set.  So truly, this is the COMPLETE ""Ellery Queen""!

I received my set today, and have already watched two episodes featuring brilliant guest stars such as Eve Arden, Bert Park, Betty White, Tom Bosley, and Donald O'Connor.  That was one of the most enjoyable things about watching the show; you never knew who would be guest-starring, and indeed the guests list throughout the brief series (22 episodes) reads like a who's-who of famous stars and character actors from the 1970's and before.

Set during the years immediately after World War II, the series often started with Inspector Queen getting involved in a puzzling murder - one that he would either bring his son Ellery (a famous writer of ""whodunnits"") in on ... or, in some cases, Ellery would be so intrigued by the case, he'd tag along.  With the police baffled, Ellery would investigate in his own quiet, intuitive style, his analytical mind often finding clues in places or people the police have overlooked entirely.  Then, close to the end, Ellery would figure out the killer ... and, in a brilliant move that set the series apart from any other, he would turn to the camera and directly address the audience, briefly going over the clues and asking (or sometimes assuming) viewers if they came to the same conclusion he did, before summoning the suspects together to reveal all.

It was a terrific format, the stories well-written and overseen by the creators of shows like ""Columbo"" and ""Murder She Wrote.""  Other than Ellery and his dad, the series was also populated by a variety of colorful secondary characters - including a muckraking columnist, a serious and quite big police sergeant who was the inspector's right-hand man ... and even a popular radio show host, named Simon Brimmer (and played to perfection by the great John Hillerman), who would often investigate and reach the solution before Ellery - usually the wrong solution.

""Ellery Queen"" is an incredible walk down memory lane, lighthearted and sometimes even humorous fun mixed in with the drama.  Wonderfully acted and written, and very evocative of the styles and mores of its time setting (1940's New York City), this boxed set is a real treat; an early birthday gift I treated myself to, and a fantastic show done justice on DVD.",1285977600,9,2840,4.820987654320987

4185725,5,B003RHZ6CK,"I received my copy of the Ellery Queen Mysteries yesterday and watched a couple of the episodes last night. There have been a number of very helpful reviews of the series already posted, but since all of them were prior to release, I'm just chiming in here to add the following:

Most importantly, the series was every bit as good when I viewed it last night as it was in my memory, where, believe me, it was pretty danged good. That's no mean feat! The acting, the pacing of the episodes (I watched Too Many Suspects and The Adventure of Auld Lang Syne) and the mysteries themselves were all uniformly excellent. It was a pleasure to get reacquainted with Jim Hutton, too, whose work I've always enjoyed and have missed.

The picture and sound are very good. I'm not a video/audio techy person, so I can't go into particulars and while I could see that the picture wasn't up to blu-ray standards, I was completely satisfied.

The case is nice and includes a Reference Guide with a synopsis of each of the episodes, some color stills and essays from Janet Hutchings (editor of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine) and Andrew Gulli (Managing Editor of The Strand Magazine).

IMHO, the producers of the DVDs have done this great series proud and I'm so glad they finally got around to it!

Very highly recommended.

One last note: If there are any fans of this series who have never gotten around to reading the Ellery Queen books (the ones starring Ellery), I highly recommend that you give them a try as well. They're intricate and superbly plotted as well as being very entertaining reads. On my shelf, they sit alongside Agatha Christie, which is about the highest praise I can give them. :)",1285632000,50,1689,4.632107023411371
4185726,5,B003RHZ6CK,"Actually I've been waiting for this series to come to disc.

I was thrilled to see Jim Hutton's son doing an EXCELLENT job as Archie Goodwin on Nero Wolfe and thought ""Gee he's doing as good a job as his dad bringing to life an iconic detective figure""  Seen quite a few examples on television ( Peter Lawford - shudder)and radio shows (listening) and made for TV movies and they all distorted the figures of EQ, NW, & AG.

These two sets (Queen & Wolfe)are worth every penney and I would be extremely pleased to recommend them to anyone who is interested in some of America's detective fiction from the 20's on up to now.

8403712,5,B003RHZ6CK,"This is an Amazon Video specific review. I am not here to review the content of Ellery Queen, as you can find wonderful reviews all over the place covering all of the subjective issues like actors and set design from people who are very passionate about such things. I am very passionate about picture and sound, the good old fashioned video and audio quality battle, from one transfer to the next, who wins.

First, there is no Blu-ray of Ellery Queen anywhere in the world. I would know. There is an excellent DVD release that was discontinued and costs quite a lot of money, more than most have to spend, even on an old favorite like this. I happen to have the DVD, from when it was much less expensive, have watched it many times, and will again. But, when I am being lazy and want some Ellery, right now, no effort put forth, I turn on Amazon Instant Video and watch an episode. And so, in comparison, I have found that the DVD transfer source and the Amazon Video transfer source are, indeed, the same, identical, original source material.

Considering the type of limited restorative work that was done for the DVD, the film actually cleaned up quite well and looked pretty clean, with good color and image stability, for a DVD. I really believe that with a little love they could manage an HD transfer but, truly, that is never going to happen and we are lucky they took this digital transfer while the celluloid was still in good condition. Of course that is the DVD. Lucky for you, if you are reading this, the Amazon Video is the same, with the same little flaws here and there, and I do mean little, the same great picture quality, stability and color, with that classic half-moon nightmare orange sofa in the pilot film to prove it. The picture is, like the DVD, clean and, for the most part, stable, as said, and the color reflects what I remember of Ellery's study, Dad's office, and the various New York staples we see throughout. The audio is also the same, that is to say that it is also identical to the DVD set, and quite good considering the source.

I know it matters to no one but, if they could find a way to do the same for McMillan & Wife, similar in quality on DVD to the Ellery Queen DVDs, that would be a spectacular Amazon Video find. But, back to Ellery, I highly recommend the Amazon Video version of the first season, when it is under thirty dollars, to anyone who cannot afford one of the remaining DVD sets. It looks as good as it likely ever will and sounds better than I remember, because my television is better, as are all of yours. I think that huge monstrosity is still disassembled in a huge box out in the garage.

Good luck finding what you are looking for.",1513641600,4,2701,4.406813627254509
