2822537,4,B000PHX4HY,"Previously, I purchased Teletubbies Springtime Surprises for my infant daughter and she loved it, and since she also loves dancing I thought this would be a good choice. The dvd is comprised of several episodes of the Tubbies united by a theme of musical instruments. You can play the episodes one at a time or all at once. Unfortunately there's not really much dancing, except for the two bonus features which must be played separately. Still, my daughter (now 18mos) does seem to like it, though not as much as the Springtime Surprises dvd.",1212451200,6,542,4.776595744680851

8191544,5,B000PHX4HY,I purchased this item as a gift for a little girl. She was 2 years old at the time and is now 3 1/2. She still loves this DVD. Her favorite episode is about the Music Box. It a great DVD for the price. I like that it is broken into 3 segments. I would definitely buy this item again.,1238371200,,283,3.7333333333333334
