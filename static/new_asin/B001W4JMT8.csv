8346991,5,B001W4JMT8,"I've still got excerpts of the dialogue of this show in my head twenty years later.  About ten years after the series first aired, around the time I was doing my A levels, the BBC decided to show reruns and had old people like me ringing CBBC in droves for a chance to sing the iconic outgoing theme music!  It's got that madcap 1980s silliness vibe - obvious comparisons would be Young Ones or Red Dwarf, but its topical humour has echoes of a gentler Mock the Week. I don't even mind the episode when Gary and Graeme accuse Arsenal of playing incredibly boring football (a sentiment I find highly offensive!).  Would definitely recommend this to parents looking to make their child laugh and get them thinking creatively at the same time - Maid Marian's influence is clearly found in the work of modern humourists in all disciplines.  Or I could be fondly imagining that, but either way, watch this because it's really, really funny!",1260316800,2,935,4.648484848484848
