3148387,5,B0015XL7T4,"I can't believe they are finally releasing Season 3 of Charles in Charge.  They are making us wait too long in between seasons.  I don't know why they do this to us.  Who wouldn't want to watch a show with two handsome guys, Scott Baio as Charles and Willie Aames as Buddy (Buddance Lembeck).",1210636800,5,292,4.37037037037037
3148388,5,B0015XL7T4,"Ok so Charles in Charge is a guilty pleasure but I enjoyed watching this show so much as a youngster. Scott Baio was such a good actor back then, he was made for this role. I can't believe the third season will be out soon, keep 'em coming. Enjoy!",1208304000,6,247,4.061224489795919
3148389,4,B0015XL7T4,THE CHARLES IN CHARGE SEASON THREE IS A GREAT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION OF CHARLES IN CHARGE. ALSO ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES SO FAR. THANK YOU:FRANCAIS1959.,1318809600,,155,4.777777777777778
3148390,4,B0015XL7T4,Does the 3rd season set contains the missing episodes from the 2nd Season set or does it contain the same 3rd season episodes they showed on the 2nd Season set?,1274572800,,160,4.366666666666666
3148391,5,B0015XL7T4,"I love watching all the old episodes.  If you were a child of the 80's and loved to watch Happy Days and Charles in Charge, then you will love these... Scott Baio is sooooo cute!!  And I love the fact that the corkiness is so innocent and real.  Total nostalgia.",1234656000,2,262,4.2
3148392,5,B0015XL7T4,"I bought this DVD the day it came out, and I loved it. I love this show!! This season is definetly my favorite season so far. I loved every episode! Please release the final 2 seasons!",1231977600,,184,4.138888888888889
3148393,5,B0015XL7T4,I have given this a 5 star based on the first 2 seasons. As I recall Charles in charge only lasted 2 seasons in Australia. Before being canned. So finally I will get to see Season 3.,1231804800,,182,3.945945945945946
3148394,5,B0015XL7T4,"Welcome to the Powells - Join Jamie, Sarah and Adam in the third season of Charles in Charge.  Now this is real tv that you can enjoy with the family.  This is one of those programs you could enjoy as a kid or as an adult without fear of hearing curse words or very adult rated themes.  This was a time when tv was innocent and enjoyable. Boy do I miss those days.  So if you are into good clean fun join Charles and the rest of the cast as Charles helps the little darling grow up.",1216857600,4,482,3.9381443298969074
3148395,4,B0015XL7T4,"I always loved watching Charles In Charge.  It was always funny, I used to follow Jamies fashion style and Charles was very easy on the eyes.  When I watched this entire season the other week, I loved watching all the episodes that I remembered well, but these days it's not as funny as it used to seem.  I think sitcoms have gotten so much smarter, that this humour is tired now.  It's still cool to enjoy a show that I used to love, but it's not going to be something I'll watch over and over.  And while I love all the characters, this season seemed to make Buddy more stupid (and subsequently annoying) than ever.  Other than that, this is fun to watch purely for sentimental reasons and to watch Scott Baio again (while he still looked good).",1216512000,11,747,4.3768115942028984
3148396,4,B0015XL7T4,"All in all, I like Charles in Charge. It is by no means my favorite sitcom from the 80's, but for the most part it's engaging and funny. Some of the episodes can border on way-too-corny (to the point of nausea), but even this can be funny if you are in the right mood. They do sort of run the token side kick (the one who played the ship wrecked jungle kid in the movie, something Lagoon, with Brook Shields) a little into the ground.",1216339200,5,434,4.117647058823529
3148397,5,B0015XL7T4,"One of the better seasons. A definite sitcom classic. If you love everything Scott Baio, you will enjoy. Thanks.",1215648000,6,112,4.947368421052632
3148398,4,B0015XL7T4,The third season of Charles in Charge was excellent.  This is a good retro show from the late 80s that will always be a classic.  I can't wait for the remaining two seasons. Keep em coming !!,1215129600,9,191,4.135135135135135

8260319,5,B0015XL7T4,"It is unbelievable to me that Amazon holds on to rights of this TV series and continues to refuse to make any more DVDS.  Either make more DVDs or sell the rights to someone who will.  It has been years since you could buy this series for anything that is close to reasonable.  Not everyone wants to stream video, some of us want to own the DVD!!!",1390867200,3,347,4.149253731343284
