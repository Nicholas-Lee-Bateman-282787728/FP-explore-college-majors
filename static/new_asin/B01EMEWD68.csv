7738761,2,B01EMEWD68,"This review is on the multi-format. It arrived today and I already have a return label. As much as I was hoping this would be high quality and the perfect gift for my son for his birthday, I can't justify the price. It is small. The front plastic cover is kinked because they shipped it with a heavy household item, and it is simply not worth the money (to me). Somewhat heartbroken. My son would have loved it.  I hope your perception of its value is better than mine. Peace.",1474416000,2,476,4.288888888888889
7738762,5,B01EMEWD68,Awesome piece of history. Great for any fan of Jim Henson David Bowie or the Labrynth/mythology and fantasy .,1474329600,,109,4.7894736842105265
7738763,1,B01EMEWD68,"For some reason I thought this was gonna be a ""numbered"" limited edition as well as being much larger.....the height of this package is less than my hand...a large soup mug would be about the size of it...the price didn't dip on release day like I hoped/ assumed it would so I will surely be returning this one...not even close to being worth 75 ...I would value this at the most at 35 and that's pushing it. I took several pictures to show how actually small and pathetic this is for $75",1474329600,67,488,4.315217391304348
7738764,5,B01EMEWD68,"This is sincerely one of my favorite movies ever. I have been watching it for 30 years and it still never gets old. No one is murdered in a bloody bath of anger; no one is snorting cocaine, there are no pushing the verge of porn scenes.... Sorry. It's just a great story with wonderful acting, and amazing, tangible special effects. If you are rating this moving anything less than 4 stars, you definitely need more magic in your life.",1474243200,3,435,4.45
7738765,5,B01EMEWD68,"Ok, since we don't have it in hand at this moment, this is still one of my all time favorite movie. Even though I didn't watch this when I was born, I exactly watched it when I was just in my last year or so in Elementary and fell in love with this movie years after. I don't care if I remember the lines or the music, it's still the best one from 1986.",1470268800,6,353,3.7837837837837838
7738766,4,B01EMEWD68,"Update 11 - 4 - 16 : OK so I got the box and I checked it out just so people would understand I gave this a fair review. I AM a little sad that I paid full price as now looking at it it's only 52. The good news is that for 52 it's a good price if you are a fan of the movie however I feel that 75 this still might be a bit overpriced for what you get. I am downing this to 4 stars because I would have really appreciated the 4k in this spiffy case for the full 75 dollars. I do wanna support the movie though so for the 30th anniversary I'm OK with this blatant money grab. Still a dang good movie! And the case still looks amazing on my shelf!

What is this world coming to? No, I'm being serious. Where people rate this cult classic of a movie as bad... Not to mention this review is for the ANNIVERSARY GIFT SET! HOW CAN YOU RATE IT ANYTHING? Fine, wanna be bratty kids and just rate the movie part without the exact item in your hands? I give this movie a 5 out of 5. Why? Because I literally watch the Blu-Ray every weekend... along with The Goonies, the Neverending Story, Princess Bride, and many others. It's my childhood and I would rather watch this than half the crap that comes out of hollywoods rear end.

Find my review helpful if you love the classic slightly cheesy family friendly movies that will live in in your hearts and minds forever.",1462665600,483,1356,4.037174721189591
7738767,3,B01EMEWD68,"I grew up on Henson's beautiful work, and love Brian and Wendy Froud's Art. (Did you know the child is their own son in real life?) But for the money, buy the Jim Henson Fantasy collection here on Amazon and under the ""Frequently Bought Together"" select the Jim Henson's The Storyteller with John Hurt. You'll have a mountain of mesmerizing material at half the price and no plastic box that won't fit anywhere but the resale cabinet at Vintage Stock. Hope that helps.",1462492800,16,468,4.650602409638554
7738768,1,B01EMEWD68,"I pre-ordered this over a year ago and paid full price, plus shipping. I was very excited about it and sad. It arrived, The packaging and the little booklet are beautiful. However, I could not bring myself to watch the disc right away as I was still grieving David Bowie's death.  Today, a year or so later, I felt ready to watch one of my favorite movies and rejoice in the music and Jim Henson's vision on the remastered disc. The DVD is blank. Now it is too late to do anything about it. That is my fault, I guess, but disappointing and heartbreaking, nonetheless.",1494115200,,567,4.4

7738770,3,B01EMEWD68,"Not sure how many stars to give. The plastic casing came with a large crack, the quality isn't much (if any) better than VHS, and the digital copy was region locked to Canada (although Sony customer support was kind enough to add it to my account anyway). However--it's THE LABYRINTH!! So the movie itself of course is five stars \_()_/",1492560000,,336,4.616666666666666
7738771,4,B01EMEWD68,It's a smaller version of the one that cost  $75. This one was $35. It was half the size but still very happy with it.,1490400000,,118,3.72

7738773,5,B01EMEWD68,"Aside from a great movie, this special edition set is really high quality and an excellent gift for any Labyrinth fan.

7738783,1,B01EMEWD68,"The movie is perfect.  This is a rant for the Amazon Collector's Edition.  I was excited for this to come in yet nervous at the same time.  Initially, no dimensions were given, nor about the quality/craftsmanship.  Well let's just say ""Yikes!""  The height of the M.C. Escher-isque box is slightly taller than the blu-ray case and made by amatuers.  Sooo not worth the $75 retail price.  Too be honest I might pay $10 for it but otherwise it's just an insult to die-hard Labyrinth fans.  It seems to be another pathetic attempt to profit off of David Bowie's death knowing the extreme devotion of his fans (I'm one of them, hence my pre-order of this set).  However, like most people I'll be returning this rip-off and buying the anniversary blu-ray by itself.
Basically, stick to just the DVD or blu-ray.",1481932800,4,804,4.685714285714286

7738787,5,B01EMEWD68,This has a prominent spot on my shelves. Just recently I started a Labyrinth corner because of the role this movie played in my childhood. I remember having the VHS tape break apart from so much use. There is so much nostalgia with this film.,1479859200,9,242,4.4

JUST GET THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION BLU RAY, PEOPLE! It comes with a mini book - then spend the extra money on getting the awesome Labyrinth Funko POP dolls.",1475452800,4,371,4.314285714285714
7738798,1,B01EMEWD68,The movie was good.  The collectible that came with the box wasn't that great and not worth $75.  I had preordered it and later that same week the price dropped by $23.  I didn't want it and sent it back.  This is the second time Amazon screwed with a pre-order where I had to challenge them.  I'm done.,1475452800,,303,4.155172413793103

7738804,2,B01EMEWD68,"First of all, I can't say enough good things about the movie itself. I have loved Labyrinth since my early teens, and it harkens back to the days when there really was magic left in movie making. I immediately pre-ordered this 30th Anniversary edition when it was announced months ago, and paid the full list price. When it was delivered last week, I found the collectible packaging to be somewhat of a let-down as other have noted. It is nothing more than thin plastic and cardboard. The blu-ray itself is nice and comes in a bound case with several glossy pages of Labyrinth trivia and history. The restored transfer looks great. But honestly, if I had known the collectible box was so cheap I would have just gotten the blu-ray by itself.
To add insult to injury, less than a week after release the price here has dropped by $23 and Amazon has refused a price adjustment. From now on I will purchase my blu-rays from local retailers instead.",1474675200,6,944,4.591715976331361
7738805,5,B01EMEWD68,No better way for the 30th anniversary edition to be boxed. It's absolutely perfect. Love the book included with behind-the-scenes images.,1474502400,,138,5.619047619047619
7738806,3,B01EMEWD68,"(Edited to mention download code.)

This review is just for this version, not the movie itself.

The 30th anniversary case (with the Escher-esque box) is listed as multi-format. It has a Blu-ray disc and digital download code, but no DVD.",1474502400,5,238,4.925
7738807,2,B01EMEWD68,"This is purely a review for the 75.99 amazon exclusive box. Not the movie. I love the movie

the box that holds the stairs scene is plastic that should have been made to close easily again. But doesn't.
The stairs scene box is plastic on the outer front and the rest feels like chunky cardboard. It would definitely get damaged from just being on display without the plastic box it comes in.
There is a slot on the back where a book/ disc case is located. An interesting read and nicely made.
The special features are actually very interesting. I like that labyrinth fans were given more and a remembering the goblin king segment is one of them!
However for the cost of 75.99 it's  not worth it. Might as well buy just the 4k disc for 22 bucks. I would say that the way this commemorative box is made it is worth noting more than 45.00. It's not made to last hard to display without the neat plastic box it came in because it can't stay closed properly without tape.
I am honestly disappointed in this buy.",1474416000,46,1006,4.345744680851064
