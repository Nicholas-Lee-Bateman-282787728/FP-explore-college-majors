8624382,3,B00GLXWN0A,Don't know why this was even a 3D. not very good,1424563200,,48,3.4545454545454546
8624383,3,B00GLXWN0A,"The 3D on this is odd, I really don't believe that it was natively photographed  but by some type of software conversion.  There are a few odd effects, as in the narrator's shirt comes forward and his arms much further back.  Would recomend Ghost Hunters over this first but it is a good first effort.",1397260800,,301,4.4363636363636365
