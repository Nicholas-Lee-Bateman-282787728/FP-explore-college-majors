3153182,5,B001675ZHY,"I first saw The Real McCoys as a very small child during the original network airings in the early 1960's and then in weekday morning network repeats. Many years passed before I saw it again. I am now hooked and don't know why the show has been so seldom seen for many years. Maybe the airings on The Nashville Network created enough interest in releasing the show on DVD to make it happen. With the first three seasons already out and the other three promised this is just great. Even if the shows are missing some original material, I would much rather have them than not see the show at all. The legendary Walter Brennan still holds the record for most Best Supporting Actor Oscars won - three. Apparently, when asked to be in The Real McCoys he was reported to have said ""But, I'm no comic!!"". Another reviewer compared Redd Foxx and Don Knotts to Walter Brennan. While they are entitled to their opinion, as much as I truly loved Don Knotts, especially as Barney Fife, he nor Redd Foxx (does anyone really remember anything he did other than play Fred Sanford?), nor the other actor this reviewer mentioned, whose name I did not recognize, can even be remotely rated alongside an actor of Walter Brennan's stature and magnitude. He is widely rated by many noted film critics as possibly the greatest character actor of all time!! He was also a quite remarkable man in real life. I would love to read a complete biography of his life if one is ever written. I recommend that anyone interested should read up on him on the Net. I was amazed at his life story. Richard Crenna was very good as Luke and had a long and distinguished career after The Real McCoys. But my personal favorite was the lovely and talented Kathleen (""Kathy"") Nolan as Kate. She was really the heart, soul and conscience of the show. It was such a pity that she left the series after the fifth season and was written out altogether for the ill-conceived and advised sixth and final season. Although she would make many guest appearances on many other shows in the years to follow, she would never create or make a character so completely her own again, as she did Kate McCoy. Certainly for this reason, they were very wise not to simply cast another actress as Kate, as Bewitched foolishly and poorly did several years later on with the character of Darrin Stephens. Lydia Reed was good as Hassie and Michael Winkelman was good as Little Luke. Tony Martinez was also excellent as the farmhand who became a member of the family, Pepino. The supporting cast, especially Andy Clyde and Madge Blake were also excellent. It was usually Kate and Pepino who tempered the schemes and shenanigans of Grandpa and Luke and brought them to their senses, steering them the right way. It would be fantastic to have complete episodes, but I just hope they do release at least seasons four and five. Season six to me is like The Andy Griffith Show without Barney Fife. I really don't even want to see it. It was just not the same show at all without Kate. Actually more sad without Kate and I also believe both Hassie and Little Luke were also dropped before the show ended. I also read that even Walter Brennan did not appear in the last thirteen episodes of the last season. Apparently those episodes featured Luke and Pepino. The predominate theme of the sixth season was Grandpa trying to play matchmaker for the newly widowed Luke. Not for me thank you very much, actually quite depressing more than anything else. But I definitely want seasons four and five to go along with the first three, which I already have. The Real McCoys was the first of the ""rural"" shows. But to me it had something that maybe only The Andy Griffith Show had from time-to-time and that is that it touched on more believability and realism than other shows of the day. I think The Real McCoys was more than just a run-of-the-mill rural sitcom. The more episodes of the series I see convinces me even more of that. The show also had warmth, values and a heart. Something you sadly certainly cannot say about any of the modern shows.",1223078400,14,4072,4.564207650273224
3153183,5,B001675ZHY,"I've watched the first 3 seasons of the Real McCoys that I purchased here on Amazon. I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the discs. ..and its a great value given the 39 or so episodes you get (compared to the 20 or so today).  I'm old enough to remember seeing them when I was young, but don't remember the details of any of them, so it's like seeing them again for the first time.

Walter Brennan, of course, was great, but my favorite was Kathy Noland as Kate. Most of the episodes have Grandpa and Luke making stupid, often racial or sexually prejudiced decisions on everyday issues with Kate providing the sense of morality, and the acceptable behavior for them to follow in the end. In my view the program was really a fore-runner for women's rights (with a few episodes as exceptions). It showed a woman willing to do her ""traditional"" role as a woman but never forgetting to remind the men in her life of the fairness of the concept of the equality of women (and with her own decisions often far surpassing the intelligence or moral fortitude displayed by Grandpa and Luke).

There was always a morality lesson in most episodes but always with great comedic results and a familiar feeling that you've learned these same lessons some time far in the past and can relate to each lesson. I never felt like I was being lectured to about the moral story being presented.

Kate's beautiful smile and great disposition (most of the time) makes it a pleasant series to watch, independent of any morality lesson offered.

Although a lot of it is dated, the scripts are still funny and the situations are very real. I especially recommend this to the people that never saw it the first time. You'll be surprised at how good it is. In my opinion, none of the follow-on ""rural series"" matches its quality and comedy (Bev. Hillbillies, Green Acres, etc.)

Enjoy these series and hope that they keep coming out with more for us to watch. Bring on all 6 seasons, please.",1222819200,3,1968,4.576704545454546

Legendary character actor (and Academy Award winner) Walter Brennan is right up there with Don Knotts, Redd Foxx and Michael Richards as one of the most unforgettable comic performers of all time.

3153189,5,B001675ZHY,"Infinity Entertainment is doing as great job with reasonable and timely releases of The Real McCoys.  The 39 episode Season 3 first aired on July 17,1959.  Imagine a series starting in July and running for 39 weeks!

Yes I know Infinity has remastered but not restored any of the season sets with each episode running a bit short at 22.5 minutes (still more than any of today's media).  I'm sure they are using the most affordable media source available.  Still the video is a nice clean grayscale and the audio is crisp.  The occasional snap, crackle & pop of the audio & video kind of reminds me of first seeing them on the old family B&W 19"" console.

Enjoy the comedic antics of Grampa Amos McCoy and family and the tender family moments as well.  Super family friendly, recommended without reservation for all!",1211760000,23,815,4.65034965034965

The stories include deep-hearted feelings about family and neighbors, and some light-hearted humor.  This family isn't perfect either, but a pleasure to watch.  The episodes are about 30 minutes long--this was perfect to watch after our evening meal.  I personally recommend it for family viewing.",1385856000,,387,5.193548387096774

3153225,2,B001675ZHY,"The show was one of the elderly parent's favorite from 1960s USA television.  I bought one collection each, of the first three seasons.  The vendor (supplier to Amazon) for the DVD collections used cheap plastic cases for the DVDs, in which the plastic center post clips inside used to hold the DVD in place in the case, were so thin and brittle they broke almost immediately, requiring I buy new generic DVD cases from the local Radio Shack.  Pretty poor quality materials used.",1337472000,,479,4.746987951807229
3153226,4,B001675ZHY,"This show is wonderful. Walter Brennan is a very talented actor, and his antics will have you laughing out loud. He really makes the show come alive in a time when tv was actually a pleasure to watch. The show is family oriented,and you won't be ashamed to watch it with all of your family present. Big ole Luke McCoy is a sweet loveable,naive,kind of guy,who can really get into some trouble. Grampa McCoy played by Brennan, has a charm all his own, and can really get into a mess. HaHa. Kate is a sweet, down to earth lady, that is a joy to watch and her wisdom is priceless. The kids, Hassie and little Luke are your typical kids learning about life and the pangs of growing up. The farm is transformed into a nice living home by Kate. You will like this show very much.",1297814400,,773,4.26530612244898
3153227,5,B001675ZHY,"They just don't make shows like this anymore. Warm, funny,humane.  Oscar winner Walter Brennan is Grandpappy Amos McCoy, creating a character who is a little ornery, stubborn as a mule, and cantankerous; but also sentimental,with good old fashioned morals and principles (remember those?) and just plain down to earth funny. His on again off again ""romance"" with Flora MacMichael, sister of his best friend George, is a particularly funny story line, as well as his dealings with the rest of the McCoys, Luke, his grandson, played by Richard Crenna, Kate, Luke's wife, played by Kathy Nolan, and Luke's brother and sister, Little Luke and Hassie: Michael Winkleman and Lydia Reed, respectively. Also on hand is loyal farm hand Pepino, played by Tony Martinez. Listing comments on the individual episodes would take pages: suffice to say that a good time is had by all on this DVD set. I think this set, Season Three, is where all the characterizations and comedy come together and start to really take off.  It is just a very fine comedy sitcom which illustrates that they don't make them this good or this funny any more. If you are down in the dumps, this show is guaranteed to make you laugh a bit and forget your troubles. Guaranteed.",1292889600,,1238,4.834905660377358

One of the best and most underrated comedies of all time. Walter Brennan is superb and the supporting cast was excellent (as long as they had a good script.) You will see if you watch later series like The Andy Griffith show and the Odd couple that many of the themes are borrowed from this show.

3387686,5,B001675ZHY,"Infinity Entertainment is doing as great job with reasonable and timely releases of The Real McCoys.  The 39 episode Season 3 first aired on July 17,1959.  Imagine a series starting in July and running for 39 weeks!

Yes I know Infinity has remastered but not restored any of the season sets with each episode running a bit short at 22.5 minutes (still more than any of today's media).  I'm sure they are using the most affordable media source available.  Still the video is a nice clean grayscale and the audio is crisp.  The occasional snap, crackle & pop of the audio & video kind of reminds me of first seeing them on the old family B&W 19"" console.

Enjoy the comedic antics of Grampa Amos McCoy and family and the tender family moments as well.  Super family friendly, recommended without reservation for all!",1211760000,23,815,4.65034965034965

He really makes the show come alive in a time when tv was actually a pleasure to watch. The show is family oriented,and you won't be ashamed to watch it with all of your family present. Big ole Luke McCoy is a sweet loveable,naive,kind of guy,who can really get into some trouble. Grampa McCoy played by Brennan, has a charm all his own, and can really get into a mess. HaHa. Kate is a sweet, down to earth lady, that is a joy to watch and her wisdom is priceless. The kids, Hassie and little Luke are your typical kids learning about life and the pangs of growing up. The farm is transformed into a nice living home by Kate. You will like this show very much.",1297814400,,773,4.26530612244898
3387724,5,B001675ZHY,"They just don't make shows like this anymore. Warm, funny,humane.  Oscar winner Walter Brennan is Grandpappy Amos McCoy, creating a character who is a little ornery, stubborn as a mule, and cantankerous; but also sentimental,with good old fashioned morals and principles (remember those?) and just plain down to earth funny. His on again off again ""romance"" with Flora MacMichael, sister of his best friend George, is a particularly funny story line, as well as his dealings with the rest of the McCoys, Luke, his grandson, played by Richard Crenna, Kate, Luke's wife, played by Kathy Nolan, and Luke's brother and sister, Little Luke and Hassie: Michael Winkleman and Lydia Reed, respectively. Also on hand is loyal farm hand Pepino, played by Tony Martinez. Listing comments on the individual episodes would take pages: suffice to say that a good time is had by all on this DVD set. I think this set, Season Three, is where all the characterizations and comedy come together and start to really take off.  It is just a very fine comedy sitcom which illustrates that they don't make them this good or this funny any more. If you are down in the dumps, this show is guaranteed to make you laugh a bit and forget your troubles. Guaranteed.",1292889600,,1238,4.834905660377358

One of the best and most underrated comedies of all time. Walter Brennan is superb and the supporting cast was excellent (as long as they had a good script.) You will see if you watch later series like The Andy Griffith show and the Odd couple that many of the themes are borrowed from this show.

The quality is good (although some scenes have been lost, sadly.) My only quibble is, where's season 4? And the rest of them? It's been a long time since season 3 was released, now. I would happily purchase all of them and I know others would too.",1231372800,6,659,4.39344262295082
