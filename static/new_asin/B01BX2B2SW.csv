7670713,1,B01BX2B2SW,I am disappointed as I thought I was getting Season 4.  False advertising.  Sold as 360 minutes.,1515456000,,96,4.588235294117647
7670714,4,B01BX2B2SW,"On  May 7, 2016, I ordered ""Last Tango in Halifax: Season 4."" I had been notified more than once there would be a long delay, but I wanted Season 4, so I chose to wait. On January 3, 2018, this ""Last Tango in Halifax Holiday Special"" DVD was delivered, and appears to be taking the place of the Season 4 DVD that I ordered in 2016. What happened to ""Last Tango in Halifax: Season 4?"" I will keep the Holiday Special DVD as I want all in the series. However, I was never notified of a change/substitution. What's up?

7670717,5,B01BX2B2SW,"My husband and I just loved this show and are so sad to see that there will be no further seasons.  Watched this during the holidays and it does wrap up the loose ends of the series, well sort of anyway.",1514937600,4,203,3.951219512195122
7670718,3,B01BX2B2SW,I was also disappointed as I thought I was purchasing season 4 not just a two episode holiday special.,1514937600,2,102,4.421052631578948
7670719,4,B01BX2B2SW,"A little upset, this was suppose to be season 4 but instead it is the Christmas Special. Disappointed.",1514851200,6,102,4.722222222222222
7670720,5,B01BX2B2SW,I saw the the LTIH Christmas special a few weeks ago on a streamline service.  Excellent as always. I wish there were a few more episodes; glad to see theses 2 though.  I wouldn't be surprise if this is the end of the series. When will streamline be available for purchase?,1513468800,3,273,4.333333333333333
7670721,5,B01BX2B2SW,"QUESTION-is this season 4 and an Xmas special?

I loved seasons 1-3, wonderful cast & show.",1513382400,6,91,4.6875
7670722,5,B01BX2B2SW,"Got to admit my age is that of the leading roles in this delightful Last Tango in Halifax series. My wife and I (also in our second round of love and marriage) cant get enough of the characters and their stories. Sometimes its outlandish, but the acting is excellent, and the reaction to the older couple serving as matriarchs to the misfit clan is nothing but honest. And they are totally into each other with a caring seldom seen in other dramas. We have been buying this series from Amazon since the beginning and will until the show eventually ends; is season 4 the end? It seems to be so. We re-watch the seasons DVDs often. This review is a high recommendation for buying all four seasons.

The writing is great, but the performance of the four primary lead roles makes this series what it is. Quirky, yet quite lovable characters, thrown together by a youthful love affair that was lost, then rekindled magically in season one. Celia (Anne Reid -Bleak House Upstairs Downstairs Prisoners Wives) love Alan (Derek Jacobi Cadfael Kings Speech). Sarah Lancashire (The Paradise Happy Valley Lark Rise to Candleford) plays Celias adult daughter Caroline, the gal with excessive attitude. Alans country farm daughter Gillian (Nicola Walker MI-5 Prisoners Wives). Four brilliant award-winning leads that make this series one to treasure forever. The reason I recommend DVDs.
And I strongly recommend any of the series mentioned after the four actors names. Each is a five-star series or miniseries.",1508284800,21,1497,4.964143426294821
7670723,1,B01BX2B2SW,"Product was described as Season Four, and instead received the Holiday Special.
The mistake wasn't noticed until two days after the ""no return"" date expired, so am extremely disappointed.
False advertising!!",1517788800,,207,5.709677419354839
7670724,5,B01BX2B2SW,"I really like it, sorry that the series is over",1517529600,2,47,3.8

7670726,5,B01BX2B2SW,Its the continuation... a year or 2 later with what is happening to the families. enjoyable waiting for Sally Wainwright to write the next season to begin filming supposedly at the 2018... looking for to seeing Sarah Lancashire again fabulous actress!,1517184000,2,251,5.146341463414634

7670729,4,B01BX2B2SW,"REC'D HOLIDAY SPECIAL DVD 1/2/18 - WAS EXPECTING SEASON 4, SO AS OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE SAID REALLY DISAPPOINTED.  WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THERE WOULD BE A CHANGE.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REAL SEASON 4 WE WERE ALL EXPECTING?",1516233600,,230,4.725

7670731,5,B01BX2B2SW,One of my favorites of all time!  Superb performance by Sarah Lancashire and Nicola Walker! A must see series. Own the entire set. I just hope they make more!,1515542400,3,158,4.448275862068965
7670732,3,B01BX2B2SW,I thought I was getting season 4 but this is just the holiday special. Is there a season 4 or is that it? It was okay but left to much up in the air.,1515542400,,149,3.411764705882353
8751825,5,B01BX2B2SW,"Just a heads up, the holiday special is considered to be season 4 of the series. The story feels rushed and a lot of details are left out but it's better than nothing. Still enjoyable to see these characters.",1537228800,,208,4.358974358974359
8751826,5,B01BX2B2SW,Love this series.,1532044800,,17,5.0

8751828,4,B01BX2B2SW,I liked the story but was very disappointed  to find out that it was the same one that I had under the name of Christmas Special 2016 And seeing by some other reviews. Other people have been caught out as well. I read the description and  before buying it and it was totally different to one I had on the back of my copy  and the cover was different so thought it was series 4. so now I have 2 copies of the same Disc.,1519344000,3,418,3.8941176470588235
8751829,5,B01BX2B2SW,"The show itself is outstanding.  That said, I am very irritated with those who've been making this show.  They did a few seasons, then this special, and now we're told they are not doing any more.

That was handled TERRIBLY.  For instance, in this special, we find out that one of the characters suspects that her barn is inhabited by an unfriendly spirit.  There are a couple of shots of the large, closed barn door with foreboding background music.  Why start a storyline like that if there is never going to be a resolution to the question?

VERY, VERY disappointed in the BBC.",1518912000,3,580,4.572815533980583

8751831,5,B01BX2B2SW,I had no negative thoughts about any of these movies. All were very good in their own way. Enjoyed them all.,1518480000,,108,4.190476190476191
8751832,1,B01BX2B2SW,"Pre-ordered Season 4, got this instead.  Admittedly the advertised price came down... but I didn't see any notice that Season 4 would be delayed, and replaced with this... but still, it's two episodes at $10 a pop... half again what I'd pay in a movie theatre on the big screen.  I've loved this BBC production, and am giving this one star for the ""switch and bait"" as one other review called it.",1518220800,4,396,4.486111111111111
8751833,4,B01BX2B2SW,"I love the Halifax series, so I was thrilled when a couple new episodes were released. The writing isn't as good as in the previous seasons, but I enjoyed seeing my favorite characters again.",1518048000,,191,4.647058823529412
8751834,3,B01BX2B2SW,Bought it to have all the series and movies. Not one of the better ones. Watch it if just want to see all the stories about these characters.,1517961600,2,141,4.071428571428571
