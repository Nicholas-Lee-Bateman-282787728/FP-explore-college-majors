2356542,5,B000A3QLUU,"No sophomore jinx here!  In season two, ""Corner Gas"" continues to deliver more of what made it great while still in its first season.  I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed every episode of the first 4 seasons of this show.  I sincerely hope that WGN, which carries the series in the USA, will soon begin broadcasting the current season as they air in Canada.  (Currently they only air reruns.)

I have heard this series compared to ""Friends.""  However, to me, ""Corner Gas"" is much better than ""Friends.""  ( . . . and I liked Friends)

This show is REAL.  True-to-life characters (I KNOW some of these people!!!) and realistic, if zany circumstances.  The show doesn't even use a laugh track--which some may take as amateur or unprofessional, but to my mind only adds to its realism and warmth.

The show continues to revolve around the main character, Brent and the independent gas station he owns and operates in Dog River, an extremely small (fictional) town in the middle of Saskatchewan, Canada.  Personality conflicts, heavily influenced by lifelong exposure to the same small group of people add to the magnitude and scope of the hilarious stories.

Brent Butt, the show's writer and creator, is a true master storyteller in the classic sense, during an age when even average storytellers are becoming fewer and farther between.  I think what I like most about his humor is that it points out the humorous side of small town life without in any way being derogative or condescending.  It is more the self-deprecating humor of someone who can laugh at himself with grace and style.

Corner Gas is routinely hilarious, averaging many small laughs and about 3 hard belly laughs per show.  I highly recommend it for its content as well as its comedy.  Its only consistent crude element is frequent use of the word ""Jack@$$"" by a cantankerous curdmudgeonly character, Brent's father, also a regular on the show.  Thusfar, aside from Oscar's frequent use of his trademark expletive, Lacey's frequently immodest tops have been the only common example of impurity.  Overall, this is one of the cleanest shows I have ever seen--proof that something doesn't have to be immoral to be entertaining.

Season Two's DVD's are well designed.  Menu navigation is fairly smooth.",1207785600,6,2255,4.925729442970822
2356543,4,B000A3QLUU,"Great family oriented comedy from the fictional town of Dog River in Canada.  I enjoyed season two just as much as season one if not more.  Oscar is becoming one of my favorite sitcom characters ever.
Great show!",1206921600,,212,4.552631578947368
2356544,4,B000A3QLUU,"I will agree with the reviewers who state this comedy is top notch.  The only issue I have with this set is the video quality of the episodes.  The resolution looks lower for some reason.  The picture quality is better when you watch the episode on broadcast televison.  This isn't how it should be when you have a high quality DVD and TV video setup.  Things are a little darker and grainier.  The color is also faded.

Bad transfer maybe?",1153353600,3,440,4.425
2356545,5,B000A3QLUU,"If you have never seen Corner Gas, you're in for a real treat. You will get a taste of life in an remote prairie town where folks who have known each other forever and have a developed a whole nuanced culture of their own. The show has lots of low key jokes, paranoid humor and kind-hearted sarcasm...but they also have some over the top, deluded, grandious, hilarious schemes. The humor never gets mean though because they are all in each others lives for the duration. Wonderful ensemble show that will appeal to a wide age range.",1144108800,6,532,4.552083333333333
2356546,5,B000A3QLUU,"Corner Gas is easily the best show Canada has ever had and is without a doubt, by a landslide, the best show on television right now. After seeing two full seasons of this I can already say that this is the best show since Seinfeld which is my favourite show of all time. This show is so genious that I seriously think it has the potential to become tied with Seinfeld for my favourite show ever or very close to it. Maybe it could even surpass it but it has a very long way to go to get there. If they can keep up the quality they've got going and make at least two or three more seasons, I'd say that potential very possibly will be fulfilled. I highly doubt it will surpass Seinfeld but I think it definitely could come extremely close to a tie.

This is a show that many might consider boring and not get the appeal but you have to ""get it"" to get it if you can understand what I mean. It helps if you are Canadian or live in a small town but you most certainly don't need either of those to like this show. When I saw this show at first I knew there was something I liked about it but I never checked further into it until a while later. Probably a couple months later or so I caught an episode on T.V and really liked it. I saw a few more shortly after that and liked it more and more with each episode. Then after a while I came to the conclusion that I absolutely loved the show and had to get Season One of it on DVD. Now it has become my favourite show in ages.

So if you find you are only mildly entertained by it at first, give it a chance and watch a few more episodes and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised by how much it has grown on you.

They are currently in their third season and if the DVD of it is the quality this one is I'll probably be sure to get it.",1133740800,6,1787,3.9583333333333335
2356547,5,B000A3QLUU,"Croner Gas, now in its third season in Canada, is the story of a gas station/convenience store owner (Brent Butt, also the show's creator) and seven other main inhabitants of the small Saskatchewan town of Dog River. Unlike many US sitcoms where there is a forces laugh track and a joke or funny face that must be made every 52 1/2 seconds, Corner Gas finds its humor in the reality of life ina small, backwater town in the middle of nowhere where such things as the biggest pile of lumber in town or the town's pothole are big things to the townspeople. It also finds its humor in how people really are... characters.

This is the sort of show that a major US network would ruin if they decided to do a US version, just as they ruined Coupling a few seasons ago. Which is a pity because this is a show that deserves to be seen down here. Maybe Comedy Central will pick it up. Or, BBC America.

For those lucky enough to live in Canada or in a border town that receives CTV or Canada's Comedy Channel, you get to watch these wonderful programs weekly. For those of us in ""other"" places, we have to wait until the DVDs come out. Thankfully, the first two seasons are available from amazon.ca.  (...)",1133308800,11,1198,4.36322869955157

However, we have had problems with discs working, and by the time we watched them, the 30 days to return was over.

2356551,5,B000A3QLUU,"XXXXX

This is a Canadian T.V. sitcom created by Canadian comedian Brent Butt.  (Yes! That's his real name.)  The series ran for six seasons from Jan 22, 2004 to April 13, 2009 for a total of 107 episodes.

Deriving its name from the roadside gas station in the fictional, small (very small!) town of Dog River, Saskatchewan, Canada, ""Corner Gas"" is the only gas station within 37 miles (60 km) in any direction.

The characters of this small town are quirky:

Brent Leroy (Brent Butt) is the proprietor of the gas station.  His parents, Oscar (Eric Peterson) whose favorite word is ""jackass"" and Emma (Janet Wright) are life-time residents of Dog River.

Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) works at the station's convenience store as a retail assistant.

An adjoining cafe, ""The Ruby"", is owned by Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller), who inherited it from her Aunt Ruby.

Dog River's Police Department (the ""DRPD"") consists entirely of veteran Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal) and rookie Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn).

Brent's best friend, the perpetually unemployed Hank Yarbo (Fred Ewanuick), spends his time hanging out with Dog River residents or drinking coffee at the Ruby.

A number of notable Canadian celebrities and politicians appear as guest stars or have cameo roles in many episodes.

Most of the episodes are stand-alone and can be viewed in any order.

This very funny show, which was filmed entirely in Saskatchewan, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode.  In Saskatchewan, April 13 is known as ""Corner Gas Day.""  This show is presently televised in 26 countries.

I found that season two of Corner Gas retained its quirky characters and that all episodes retained the humour I've come to expect.  In fact, most episodes are hilarious.  The Canadian rock band ""The Tragically Hip"" appears in one of the episodes.

Finally, there is an extra entitled ""E-talk interviews.""  As well, five of the episodes have commentary, if desired.

In conclusion, the second season of the hit comedy ""Corner Gas"" presents episodes in the life of a small town where there's ""not a lot goin' on.""

Warning!!  Once you become addicted to this series, you officially become a ""Butt head.""

(2004-2005;  18 episodes on 3 discs;  22 min per episode; total time: 400 min or 6 hrs, 40 min;  full screen)

We attempted to watch more episodes on You Tube through Netflix but were disappointed many times with the chopped-up segments. Since purchasing the DVD set, my husband and I have enjoyed the smart and subtle humor that makes the series still so popular. This series is much better than what our networks offer. If you like Doc Martin, Seinfeld, and The Vicar of Dibley, you will absolutely love Corner Gas.

Buy the DVD series; you will definitely savor the momentum of the series as you laugh all the way through. Can't wait to purchase Seasons 3-6.",1403740800,,641,4.672566371681416

2356569,5,B000A3QLUU,"We (my wife and teenage daughter included) absolutely love every episode of this comedy.

Set in a remote, rural Canadian village with barely a police station, Corner cafe and gas station (referenced in the title), the characters are hilarious, their situations and how they juxtapose this to the experiences of folks living in higher-density urban setting makes for many laughs. There are no sexual innuendo, no swearing and it is completely PG-safe.

The humor is perhaps not to the taste of those who cut their teeth on ""how I met your mother"" or ""2 Broke Girls"", but in my family we much prefer the type of TV fare contained in Corner Gas.",1356393600,,643,4.732142857142857

Then my cousin said ""you started this Corner Gas thing and now it is no longer on TV, what am I supposed to do now""?  So I checked my Amazon.com and there Corner Gas was.  I let him borrow my Season One dvd and he kept it for a full month.  We both love this show, and if you really enjoy warped humor you will love it also.

Corner Gas, like any well contrived form of entertainment is an acquired taste designed by and for people of discerning character and....oh forget it, this show is FUNNY. The way it mixes wordplay and visual imagery and spoofs every show known to man...and some women is a treat and a fantastic way to escape for about 24 and a half minutes.
The characters are charming and you really want to know what they are up to. And if all you are after is some show that will parade a bevy of beautiful bodies around then Brent Leroy AKA Brent BUTT (Let me interrupt myself and say that a show whose main writer is named BUTT has got to be good!)is not gonna make it .....BUT(T) that Lacey Burroughs is some cute northern light if you know what I mean and I believe you do.
