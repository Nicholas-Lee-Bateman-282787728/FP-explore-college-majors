8343211,5,B001U9O5VA,"A fantastic, beautiful, sad film.  More like a multi-media collage piece; its like revolutionary theater; docu-drama, journalism, and slashes of jazz in one.  This was the first Haile Gerima film I ever saw and, after ""Ashes and Embers"", is my favorite.  Barbara O gives a masterful performance.  The script and the style of the movie is not only dynamic and provocative, but genuinely experimental and progressive. A radical film made at a radical time in American society - Gerima is like Robert Kramer in that he believes that films should be intense and explode like grenades.  Truth, horrors, the racism of our society, etc -- must all be revealed in direct, straight forward ways...and yet Gerima's dramas are NOT perfunctory Hollywood movies.  Not only is he a creator and member of the Third Cinema concept (Cinema One being Hollywood, Cinema Two being Europe) - he is also a brilliant humanist who uses his art to relay the suffering and psychological traumas black people experience throughout the diaspora and always makes brilliant connections between every day emotions, depression and history and current political/social situations.  Spike Lee and Steve McQueen could learn a lot from Gerima.  He's a master.  And, the way Raoul Peck seems to be ignored, has been maligned and purposely brushed under the carpet of 20th/21st century cinema.",1396137600,5,1355,5.1506849315068495
8343212,5,B001U9O5VA,"An OUTSTANDING movie. This is a rare find. There's something about originality. No compromising in this story. Filmmaker Haile Gerima has produced one of the most important pieces of work in the world of cinema.

IMPACTFUL! DIFFERENT! A MUST SEE!",1335744000,,246,5.15
