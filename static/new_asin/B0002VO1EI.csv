8495393,2,B0002VO1EI,"For anyone looking for a travel documentary about Bali and Komodo (which I thought this was) don't waste your money on this DVD.  It is about 5% good and 95% boring underwater photography narrated by an older gentleman who speaks in a monotone ramble. The background music starts off just fine with some Gamelan music, but it gets horrible later when the bad elevator music with gratuitous guitar solos start. The only thing remotely redeemable about this DVD are some of the sea creatures, like sea slugs that are filmed. In fact this movie should be re-titled ""Old man talks about sea slugs with bad music in background""",1180137600,2,622,4.7592592592592595
