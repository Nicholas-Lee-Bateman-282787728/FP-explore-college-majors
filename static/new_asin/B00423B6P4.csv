You may not understand exactly what is going on at some points of the show but stick with it and keep your mind open and it can be one of the most enjoyable shows you will ever watch. It is fantastic, the English dub is pretty good but I think the Japanese dub is still superior and recommend it over the English dub. Enjoy!",1407024000,2,397,4.306666666666667
4905264,5,B00423B6P4,Just as creepy and cyberpunk as I remembered the anime being - but now in a dual format very compact package. Finally I can phase out the 4 DVD volume set. Recommended.,1405296000,20,168,4.28125
4905265,4,B00423B6P4,"These days the term anime no longer can envelop a genre of film. There are so many sub-genres of anime that go off into so many extreme directions that there is no way an average, or even avid ""anime fan"" can really get into of all of them. One of those sub-genres lends towards psychological and philosophical content rather than dynamic action, quirky romances or sexual innuendo. Lain is more avant-garde, and delves into themes of identity, reality, death, life and a mix of other topics worthy of discussion. While I can't say this series is going to enamor itself to the average anime fan it will get many of them thinking.

The series essentially evolves around a 14 year old girl named Lain, who throughout the series struggles to learn who she is and how she fits into the grand scheme of things. Her parents ignore her focused on their own interests (mom with Lain's older sister and dad with his massive mess of computer tech); so she lives a reclusive life with barely any interaction with anybody. Then Lain receives an mysterious email from a classmate. The only problem is she gets the email after friend committed committed suicide. She then starts a journey into The Wired (like the Internet on steroids) to find answers. This is where the story gets more and more into a tangled web of mystery that goes deeper and broader into a conclusion that is pretty much all encompassing. I wish I could tell you more, but it would spoil the experience if I did. Trust me.

Serial Experiments Lain is a cerebral kind of show and does away with a lot of the standard anime themes. There is no teen angst/drama or mystical monsters, or any martial arts or gunplay to speak of. It's mostly a scenery and dialog driven show. With that you get some engrossing visuals and animation to complement this storytelling method. There is lots of symbolism too. Everything from what Lain wears to that lock of hair in her brow has a level of significance. The way the story moves keeps you as much in the dark about what is going as Lain is. It makes for a fascinating experience as you get various tidbits of information (some relevant and some not) that start to make more sense (or less) the further down the rabbit hole you go in.

The aspects of Lain that make it stand out are also the ones most prone to criticism. The pacing of the series is slow, and if you have to have some forward momentum you will have to wait a while before you see it. if you don't pay attention to just about every detail (not just the dialog but what Lain is focusing her attention on) then you run the risk of missing something that could make stuff later on make a lot more sense. It's these kinds of things that challenge some viewers to get deeper into the series, but others will simply not get it.

You get the entire series collected in a slip cover that holds two Blu-Ray cases (one with 2 discs Blu-Ray and one with 2 discs DVD). The cases have a neat feature in that the slip cover is reversible to give you double the cover artwork. You also get two booklets. The first one (Inside Serial Experiments Lain) is a huge 320 page art book filled with sketches and full production art used in designing the series. The second booklet is smaller and focuses on the restoration efforts of Lain. It has email conversations and more artwork (along with a mini-glossary of technical terms). All in all the physical content is pretty impressive.

With all 13 episodes on two discs there has been some concern of quality issues with the hi-def transfer. The 1080p transfer isn't perfect, but I am suspecting that has more to do with the source material. There are some slight color issues if you specifically look for them. Still the visuals are significantly sharper than on DVD. The aspect ratio is 1.41.1, which is very close to the original aspect ratio of 1.37.1 so I am not thinking that has anything do to with Audio is in both English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0 with English subtitles. The original show was recorded in stereo, and I'm glad they didn't try to emulate surround sound.

The extras are identical to what was offered with the DVD collection, and consist of the original commercial and U.S. trailer for the show as well as the opener and closer with the music and without the text. On an interesting aside Lain helped launch the popularity of the musicians responsible for the opening credits music. Ba's (not the K-pop artist) song Duvet launched the band's freshman album into full sold out mode to the point fans had to get more expensive imports due to unavailability. There are also trailers for other Funimation releases. Not much content, but it's better than nothing.

Serial Experiments Lain is in a way a grand experiment when it was introduced to the United States. Though many will find it too weird and slow to move others will find it engaging and immersive. If you are into a more intellectual kind of show this will be right up your alley. If you need a more visceral form of entertainment you might find Lain boring. Still it's great to see the show is still getting some exposure in a day and age where simple anime plots seem to be a dime a dozen.",1400544000,81,5167,4.531618435155413

Shown from the point of view of a little girl, SEI addresses technology, Western culture, depersonalization, dissacociation, and all manner of themes both technological and esoteric through a story which predicted rather accurately the future as our current present.

The most you can really get a feel for is that Lain's classmate dies and she gets a computer the rest is pretty much open to interpretation.

4905306,5,B00423B6P4,"I am going to be reviewing the product and not the show, im going to try to be as factual as i can

This blu ray release is very nice for a few reasons

1: the box and packaging
The packaging is nice and clean with no clutter on the front art, and a very informative backside. It looks significantly better than funimation's ""s.a.v.e."" releases. also all 4 discs, 2 dvd and 2 blu rays, fit in a standard blu ray size box

2: video quality
I haven't seen any other versions of lain to know if this is better by comparison, but the video quality overall is excellent, and its in its original aspect ratio, even though the back of the box says 16x9. There are almost no dust or specks on the screen. The colors are usually nicely balanced and the contrast is overall very good. Sometimes the video quality will take a dip, and ive seen some very low contrast in the very dark blacks, but its not too big of an issue. However sometimes i think its slightly too bright, and it just makes everything look oversaturated and slightly blurrier, and for me it was sort of an eye strain to have to look at the very bright sections, especially in contrast to the very dark sections, but this is a very minor complaint, really i could look over it most of the time, besides i don't even know if its an issue exclusive to this release of lain.

3 audio quality
The audio quality is great, lossless sound quality is always excellent, nothing is too loud, and its dynamic
(opinion incoming) watch the show with the original Japanese audio, because i have watched some episodes with the English dub, and my preference for this series is the Japanese audio

Overall i would recommend picking up this release if you enjoyed the show. its an excellent value

----------------

Additional thoughts and opinions
The Dvds included are not as nice looking as the blu rays, but if you don't have a blu ray player, this is still a great option, because it is definitely watchable on dvd albeit not as sharp and defined as the blu ray.

the menu on the blu rays looks really cool because it looks like a folder in a 90s Macintosh computer with some footage from the show in the background

the menu on the dvds looks like a 360x240 image stretched to fit the screen. it reminds me of a really early desktop background

the front cover art looks kind of goofy to me, i feel like they could have picked literally any other image of lain and it would have looked at least 20x better that what it looks like now

some of the 3dcg in the show looks really dated now (staircase in the opening), and some of it is really cool in a 90s sort of way",1429833600,29,2612,4.321063394683026

4905315,2,B00423B6P4,"I think my rating of two stars to one of the most influential and well-known anime deserves an explanation. I did not buy this for a reason, and that reason is because I was bored out of my mind. You see, I am one of those people who loved Neon Genesis Evangelion in its entirety, including the final acid episodes. Serial Experiments Lain, to which it has been compared, was a bit too much for me to handle. Not due to weirdness, per say, but weariness. The show was interesting and very intellectually refined in its ideas and perception, and the philosophical concepts were quite unique and explicitly detailed. However, the lack of plot, sympathetical characters, fitting music (I ABHOR the soundtrack during the rare times when it actually starts to play), and feelings of any kind sever the wires of such an interesting topic of discussion. I understood everything, but I was eventually bored to tears in the process, praying that it would end soon so that Excel Saga could revive me. The animation is dated, but refreshing to watch for those fans of 80's-90's anime. I get the whole wired/reality issue, but the characters could have at least started out like actual human beings. With nothing to hold your attention but nice animation and a stellar view of technology's impact on society, this show feels incredibly lacking. It has the brainpower, but is unable to pull off the emotion and characterization that made Paranoia Agent, an anime it is compared to often, so magnificent. I still recommend Serial Experiments Lain as a valuable credit for serious anime watchers and deep thinkers, but I was yawning the whole time; take my word as you see fit.",1421280000,3,1662,4.794425087108014

4905321,5,B00423B6P4,"This is a pretty good show. It's not fast paced, but if you don't give it your undivided attention you could potentially end up lost. To keep it sweet and simple: This one of those shows that people either view as extremely deep and profound, or they view it as something trying to be deep and profound but only coming off as overly artsy, nonsensical, or boring. When I ordered this I wasn't sure what to expect, But I legitimately enjoyed this show. If you're the type of person that doesn't mind watching slower paced shows and potentially having to analyze the plot, I recommend this. If you just want to be entertained and call it a day, this probably isn't for you.

Things I Liked:

- Good atmosphere.

- Interesting story.

-  Lain is a pretty interesting character.

- The potential to be something more than just another anime. (if you consider some plot points / potential sub plot points, this show was ahead of it's time.)

Potential Downside:

- To get the full Serial Experiments Lain experience, I would recommend that you marathon this show. (12 episodes)",1413763200,4,1072,4.634920634920635

As for the anime, there is not better (well revolutionary girl Utena is better, oh an Cowboy Bebop is better, oh, yes, NOIR is also better) anyway Lain is extremely good. had it back in the day on VHS. hope this order has the DVD, yes combo. combo. combo. combo. wish the makers of DVDs would stop the Blu-ray insanity. and if DVD is going the way of VHS and someday DVDs are as useless as a rock in death valley, then hate the marketing and distribution tactics. it will be a sad day when Blu-ray replaces DVDs. BUT ""until that day"", STOP the COMBOs!!!!!!!!! STOP the BLU-RAYs. wooooosh. that was tiring.",1411516800,2,859,4.36875
4905323,5,B00423B6P4,"Wish I had been turned onto this when it came out. It is stunning! Of course the animation, while superb for it's time, by today's standards is obviously sub par. But one shouldn't let that stop them. It's the story that will haunt and stun you! Someone was very insightful when the net hit our lives and saw some of the current and future problems. How much of our life is real in the web? Can electrical waves create a different reality? This is what our brains do, so why not on the web if we feed it with our brain power. Wonderful philosophy and responsible for great movies like the matrix. A definite one to see for matrix fans and anime. Was so glad the ""shorts channel"" on DirectTV turned me onto this.",1410998400,10,711,4.313432835820896

Really nice slip cover and it's blu ray sized instead of one of those stupid dvd/blu ray combo packs.

Anime:
One of the best, if not the best, psychological thriller/sci fi anime of all time. If you like the 90's, computers, mystery, a smart slow plot you will love this. PRESENT DAY> PRESENT TIME>HA HA HA.",1495584000,,313,4.491228070175438
