1042057,5,6305519579,Good for baby so that's all that matters. Enough said on how I feel about it.,1214006400,3,77,3.875
1042058,2,6305519579,"I myself really hate the dvd but I did not purchase it for me, but my 13 month old son won't watch it either.  Maybe he is too young.",1200700800,,133,3.586206896551724
1042059,4,6305519579,"This DVD is a bit different from the other (previous) Tubbies DVDs. In the past, Tubbies DVDs typically had one intro and one ending with lots of clips from various episodes in between. In addition, the video clips of real children were played only once in those previous DVDs.

This 10th anniversary DVD features three complete episodes (each one with an intro and an ending) and the video clips of real children are played twice per episode. These are episodes that apparently never aired in North America. There's some good content, in addition to several extra features (including clips from Teletubbies Everywhere, which also appears on a few other Tubbies DVDs).

I prefer the other Tubbies DVDs, like Go! and Christmas in the Snow, because they have more exciting footage that gets children to be active while they watch. But this is still a decent DVD.",1188345600,14,860,4.883561643835616
1042060,5,6305519579,"The Tubbies DVDs are a bit different from the episodes that air on TV. The TV shows are always a half-hour and they follow a predictable pattern. The DVDs have the familiar beginning and ending, but in between they show several clips from various episodes and they don't follow the same pattern. While it's not possible to buy your favorite Tubbies episodes on DVD (as far as I know), the DVDs will have clips from some of your favorite episodes.

I've seen a lot of the episodes and a few of the DVDs, and most of them over and over and over again. It's always fun to watch them with my daughter because she really enjoys them.",1170892800,17,628,4.367521367521367
1042061,5,6305519579,I bought this dvd for my little boy for his second birthday. He Loves it!!!  He watches it everyday before his nap. I recommend this dvd for all Teletubbie fans.,1167868800,10,161,4.366666666666666
1042062,4,6305519579,"I'm not certain what is taking so long to get all the Teletubbies episodes released on DVD, but this is a welcome edition. I have more fun watching it than my two boys, ages five months and twenty-seven months, do. Most adults I know find it annoying, but I appreciate the bizarre, trippy attributes. The baby in the sun is fantastic, as are Po's little ditties and the naughty Noo-Noo. Aside from adults like myself, this is probably best for children zero to eighteen months. My two year old prefers a little more action, such as dinosaurs and other animals, to the waving and chasing the Teletubbies offer. Their cooing, simple songs and very bright colors should appeal to infants (at least in theory), though video clips showing children from other parts of the globe are better suited for older children. PBS has done a good job with the DVD as well, including about an hour of program content along with a few extras and even a printed glossary of Teletubbies terminology. A good buy.",1154995200,11,991,4.668571428571428
1042063,5,6305519579,"We have 5 Teletubbies DVDs and this is the best one.  We watch the favorite scenes instead of watching the whole DVD through because my son (16 mo.) likes the parts with just the Teletubbies the best (and he's terrified of the ""Magic Cloud"" so we have to be careful not to watch that part on the DVDs) and they are the best ones I've seen.  A close second is the ""Ooh - Springtime.."" DVD.  It also has a nice special feature clip.",1141257600,28,430,4.156626506024097
1042064,5,6305519579,"A pink fluffy cloud comes inside and this is thrilling to the Teletubbies, until they have to live with the fluffy cloud for any amount of time. Then they realize what a mess it makes. A big string comes down and as the Teletubbies pull and pull on it, a big mess is made and again, NooNoo has to clean up. Custard is dropped and messes are made and fun is had by everyone.
Although this whole movie is one long movie about making messes and the funny things that can happen, there are short segments in there that make for good breaking points when watching this show. This way children can watch a short 10 min. section and not feel like they were left hanging. I find this important for my little boy who likes closure.
What makes the Teletubbies so fun to children is their predictability. If one Teletubbie tries something, they almost all get to try it.
I know there is controversy on the Teletubbies. However, I think they are cute and harmless. Surely they don't teach anything negative, they teach hugs and fun and sharing and caring, if they teach anything at all. Mainly I use this video (and all others and TV) as a time for my kids to wind down at the end of the day or just prior to nap. A short time to just sit and turn off their brains for a few minutes.",1025913600,6,1271,4.256198347107438

My daughter likes the structure of the typical show format -- with the baby in the sun, the characters interacting at home, etc. She lost interest immediately.",1214438400,6,416,4.712328767123288
