2832350,5,B000Q6GUJS,"Sony did a wonderful job with this DVD. For us fans of the show, we've been waiting a long time but the wait was worth it. All the episodes are the full, UNCUT versions! You'll see the original intro on the pilot episode when Benson arrives in a cab, gets checked by the security guard, sprinkled by the garden hose and chased by the dogs. Aside from the episodes themselves, there is a video introduction of the show by Robert Guillaume, a photo gallery, ""Favorites From the First Season"" (including commentary by Guillaume, James Noble (Gov Gatling), and Executive Producer Tony Thomas. Also included is an almost 30-minute retrospective of the show, the cast, and how the actors worked together (this also features Guillaume, Noble, and Thomas).

The artwork is nice as well. Sony has gotten their share of criticism for some of their releases but I can't complain about this one. I think it's GREAT!!",1185753600,,904,4.794871794871795
2832351,4,B000Q6GUJS,"This was and Is a great show! one of mine and my mom's favorites. I watched this show when I was a kid in the late 80's. Thsi is the first time I have seen the first season and its great so far. What makes this a cool set is the interviews, a must own for a classic Tv fan!!",1185667200,5,274,3.5833333333333335
2832352,4,B000Q6GUJS,"Benson DuBois(Robert Guilliaume) resumes his duties as a butler but for another family. Benson was first seen on the ABC soap-opera style sitcom SOAP in 1977,serving the Tate and Campbell families. I'm not sure if Benson was fired by his former employers or he voluntarily resigned. Anyway,Benson is ""movin' on up"" for this spinoff that ran on ABC from 1979 to '86,three seasons more than its parent show. SOAP got the Nielsen axe after 1980-81. Supporting Guilliaume are Caroline McWilliams,James Noble,Rene Auberjonois(reh nay auber jon wah),Inga Swenson and Missy Gold,to name a few. Get a load of the posh mansion seen on this sitcom,probably an inspiration for NBC's THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR. Previously,Guilliaume guest-starred on other series like CBS's GOOD TIMES and THE JEFFERSONS. ABC aired BENSON for the very last time on August 30,1986,nearly seven years after its premiere. The network aired DIFF'RENT STROKES for the very last time that same night also,after DS's only season on ABC(NBC aired DS from 1978 to '85).",1182297600,8,1033,5.191616766467066
2832353,5,B000Q6GUJS,"This set is long overdue.  What should be included on it is the 90 minute episode of SOAP (it had clips from season 2) that explained Benson leaving the Tates and taking the job in the Governor's mansion.  I doubt that it will be on the set, but it serves somewhat as a pilot for Benson.",1179532800,22,287,4.107142857142857

2832395,4,B000Q6GUJS,"Robert Guillaume's Benson Dubois was actually given a spinoff series from ""Soap."" He played the butler for the Tate household and was best friend with Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond). She makes a guest appearance in the first season. Benson was the voice of reason for the Tate household on Soap and he does the same here for the Governor's Mansion. Governor Gatling is Jessica Tate's cousin.

In the first season, Benson comes to help run the Governor's mansion with head housekeeper, Gretchen Krauss (Inga Swenson); governor's secretary Marcy (Caroline McWilliams); governor's assistant Taylor (Lewis J. Stadlen); and the governor's daughter Katie (Missy Gold). ""Benson"" series was actually a restrained offspring of ""Soap"" which was controversial. This series was family friendly and aired on Friday nights on ABC.

Guest appearances include Denise Nicholas, Roscoe Lee Browne (who played Benson's replacement Saunders on Soap), Katherine Helmond, Richard Stahl, Joel Brooks, and other familiar faces on television. The series should have had extras.",1438473600,2,1054,5.58125

2832424,5,B000Q6GUJS,"Benson is a classic, and this first season is about as funny as 70's/80's sitcoms come. I was very young when this first aired and I didn't know if my memories of it would hold up, but it was actually funnier than I remembered, especially the episode guest starring Katherine Helmond as Jessica, a charter from SOAP which this show spun off of. Then there was the interplay between Benson and Ms. Krauss; they always antagonized each other, but looking at it now it seems to me sometimes Benson makes comments to her that are a bit too nasty. Besides that though, this is just great and I wish they'd release more seasons.",1384300800,2,622,4.513274336283186

with interest. I live in New Zealand Region 4 it is clear now that there is lot of DVD material made for region 1 & 2 that is not coming to region 4 and to put it blunt will never ever come to region 4  surly after a few years they could make these region 1 only DVD entertainment more multi region DVD to maximise on their sales, One prime example was a UK-TV series from the 1970's called ""thriller"" a bl***y g**d series the best in my DVD collection, because at the end you never knew who was going to live or who was going to die (apart from my old favourite ""Danger Man"" I used to watch on monochrome TV), I could only buy season 1&2 on region 4, they never made the later seasons in region 4 because people in New Zealand only love watching crap I had to buy the complete series from another region  (with season 1 & 2 included). The same with Alfred Hitchcock as soon as I buy that in region 1 (Amazon.com) it comes out in region 4, (I am not buying (and would love to buy) Alfred Hitchcock season four until it comes out in region 4 or until Amazon sell it as a all region DVD,) well no more I am sick of buying region 1 (if I ever decided to sell it it has no resale value) I don't buy region 4  unless it was shown on TV before pay TV came out in New Zealand (in the mid 1990's) because there is nothing to buy it is all rubbish. As for Benson, make it multi-region I will buy it, I don't waste my time any longer going to DVD shops in New Zealand.

One last comment I am getting sick of the rubbish that comes out on region 4 it is the same rubbish that is on ""free to air TV"" the whole TV guide is rubbish, and that is what people love today on TV program ranking sheets today they only watch  rubbish and this is why I refuse to buy a BLUE-RAY player or buy any BLUE-RAY entertainment until the entertainment providers come to their senses and make ALL ""old"" entertainment multi-region.

2832473,5,B000Q6GUJS,"This is the first season's worth of ""Benson,"" ABC's 1979-86 hit comedy about Benson DuBois, butler of the mansion of Eugene Gatling, governor of an unknown state. The title character (played by Robert Guillaume) was carried over from ""Soap,"" a popular (and quite controversial) satire of daytime serials that ran on ABC from 1977-81. The governor (James Noble) was the widowed cousin of Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond), a key player in ""Soap"" as Benson's boss (and in fact Jessica makes one appearance during this season, in an episode appropriately named ""Jessica""). Other key players in ""Benson"" include:

--Teutonic housekeeper Gretchen Kraus (Inga Swenson), who, at least in context of the show, speaks with a thick Swedish or German accent (however, Swenson hails from Nebraska and speaks American English in real life, despite what you might think from watching the show)

--Katie Gatling, daughter of the governor (played by Missy Gold, sister of ""Growing Pains"" star Tracey Gold)

--Marcy Hill (Caroline McWilliams, recently deceased), secretary to the governor

--John Taylor (Lewis J. Stadlen), advisor to the governor (he would be replaced in season 2 by Rene Auberjonois as Clayton Endicott)

Sony did an admirable job putting this first season release together, at least from a technical perspective. The 24 outings of this first (and so far, only) release are uncut and mastered in HD (as well as can be expected, being that ""Benson"" was videotaped before a studio audience). Ordinarily, with Sony's track record, you'd expect their comedy releases to lack any bonuses besides previews. However, this first release of ""Benson"" has an admirable selection of features; among them is a short video introduction from star Robert Guillaume, welcoming us to ""Benson,"" and an almost half-hour retrospective called ""Inside the Governor's Mansion,"" with stars Guillaume and James Noble, and producer Tony Thomas, reminiscing about the first season of the show and its genesis from ""Soap."" Both of those are on Disc 1. The remaining bonuses are on Disc 3, and include ""Favorites from the First Season,"" where Guillaume, Noble, and Thomas talk about some of their favorites from Season 1, and a short Photo Gallery set to music; there are also several assorted previews for other Sony releases as well.

The 24 episodes are divided evenly among 3 discs (8 episodes per disc) in 2 slimcases, one having the first two discs, the other having the last one. Each case has a group image of the major players on the front, and an episode listing on the back.

All that said, I enjoyed my time with this first release of ""Benson,"" and I stand with the ever-rising hue and cry that more should be released, as ""Benson"" is one of the funniest comedies that I have ever seen.",1266883200,8,2769,5.0459518599562365
2832474,5,B000Q6GUJS,"When this series ran on TV I watched it every week.  Robert Guillaume was super in his part, and provided me with multitudes of laughs.  Of course, all the other characters were superbly cast as well.  The series was, and still is hilariously funny from start to finish with the actors playing their parts perfectly.  One reason I enjoyed it so much is because the roles played were like the lives of so many people in every day life.  They were doing their best in everyday life, sometimes successfully, many times messing up big time, but always with  the cohesiveness of a really household or family.  Under the rough exterior of some of the characters was the same basic need we all have - to be loved and understood.
Now, FINALLY, this series is coming out on DVD's.  At least now I will be able, eventually, to have the complete series - I hope!",1250640000,,851,4.48051948051948
2832475,5,B000Q6GUJS,I loved it! I had almost forgotten how good Benson's wit is. When can we expect the next season?,1244073600,,96,4.105263157894737
2832476,5,B000Q6GUJS,Benson is a very funny show me and my family enjoyed watching it and can't wait for the next seasons to come on video.,1243468800,,118,3.9583333333333335
2832477,5,B000Q6GUJS,"Excellent comedy, it has been a long time since i have seen this sitcom. The only problem i have is that, i have finished the first season and waiting for the next season(s) to go on sale is harsh.",1242259200,,197,4.076923076923077
2832478,1,B000Q6GUJS,Somehow the package was mailed w/o the DVD's inside. But...Amazon took great care of me & sent a return label for the empty box & mailed out another set that did include the DVD's. YEAH!,1236038400,,186,4.3428571428571425
2832479,4,B000Q6GUJS,"Although not nearly as funny, nor as silly, as ""Soap"", the series from which ""Benson"" spun-off, ""Benson"" has still, nonetheless, aged pretty well for a 30 year old comedy. Unlike ""Soap"", which was made in the same format as a soap opera, ""Benson"" is a straight-up sit-com, with the situation being life at the Governor's mansion (the state in which it is set is never mentioned) with the focus being on the governor's sarcastic head of staff, Benson (Robert Guillaume), his fellow staff members (including the extremely funny, no-nonsense housekeeper, Miss Kraus, played by Inga Swensen), the good-hearted but not-so-bright Governor and his young daughter. Also unlike ""Soap"", the humour is clean enough to show to the whole family. In fact, ""Benson"" is clearly targeted at a family audience. The humour is intelligent enough to amuse adults, but also understandable to children (speaking from experience, since I saw ""Benson"" for the first time as a child). The show does become a bit predictable and repetitive after 24 episodes, but if you stagger them out over a couple of months, its harmless fun that's worth investing in.",1234915200,7,1128,5.06989247311828
2832480,4,B000Q6GUJS,The only thing I can say that I do not like is the fact that only the 1st season ws available.  I hope the other seasons come out soon.,1234828800,,135,3.6551724137931036
2832501,5,B000Q6GUJS,"Okay, I loved Benson, was thrilled when season 1 finally came out on DVD, but it's been 2 years now....where are the rest of the seasons????

Must. Have. More. Benson.",1234483200,,167,4.566666666666666
2832502,5,B000Q6GUJS,I grew up on Benson and was delighted that I could watch him fuss with Krause.  It is still just as funny today.  I did not realize how much Benson was ahead of his time until I listen at the conversation.  Some of the points he made as related to race were amazing for the time.  Also his position in the Governor's house was advance for the time.  Really Great.,1232841600,,363,4.128571428571429
2832503,4,B000Q6GUJS,I love Benson.  It's just like I remember when I was a little girl.  The only things I don't like is the occasional swear words and the occasional sexual innuendos.,1226361600,2,164,4.433333333333334
2832504,5,B000Q6GUJS,"Benson was a wonderful television series that brought back many memories of laugher.  He was somewhat synical and his life with the ""not-so-smart"" governor and Mrs. Kraus was so much fun to watch.  It is my favorite kind of humor.",1224374400,,230,4.725
2832505,5,B000Q6GUJS,"I have been waiting soooo long for Benson to come out on DVD. I happened to check, by accident, when I saw the DVD listings for Soap.  The episodes of Benson are such classics. And so funny.  I didn't know that Susan Harris, who wrote for The Golden Girls, wrote for Benson as well.  I can see a little in both.  Funny story telling from the Governor. Somewhat similar to Rose's Saint Olaf stories on the Golden Girls.

The packaging is good. It's the first season. Nice set of three DVDs.  I love it. I really hope that they put the next season out soon.",1222819200,,555,4.238095238095238

2832508,5,B000Q6GUJS,"I love this show. I watched Soap and continued on to watch Benson. I am wondering, however when the rest of the episodes will be released? I actuall own the set and I have the first season on my Ipod. It's very entertaining. Can't wait to see the rest. I will be #1 on the list to purchase the remaining episodes.",1208649600,3,313,4.147540983606557
2832509,5,B000Q6GUJS,"Benson was a great sitcom and Sony did an excellent job on this season one DVD set. If you've never seen the series before, buying this DVD would be a excellent opportunity to introduce you're self to it. Benson was one of, if not the funniest sitcoms from the 80's. You know back before all the trashy humor took over television, so the whole family can enjoy. I really can't add any more that's not already been said other than, I sure hope Sony releases season two very soon.",1207353600,,478,4.382022471910112
2832510,5,B000Q6GUJS,"I found ""Benson - The Complete First Season"" to be just as funny as when I watched it years ago.  The sharp wit displayed by the residents of the Governor's Mansion makes this a stand-out compared to other degenerate TV comedies so popular today.",1205539200,,246,4.590909090909091
2832521,5,B000Q6GUJS,"I really enjoyed this long awaited video. And would approve it to anyone who does not like ""forced laughter"",that is so common today on televison. The timing of the cast is excellet,by that I mean the situations run together so smoothly,and the hate,hate relationship Benson has with Ms Krause,is really something to see.

Again,I would advise anyone who wants a great belly laugh to purchase!",1205193600,5,393,5.046153846153846
2832522,4,B000Q6GUJS,"I got this DVD for Christmas as per my request, as I was inspired by TV Land's all-too-short re-airings of the series back in the summer of '06. As a child of the '80s, I tend to appreciate '80s sitcoms more than most, but often times it's due to nostalgia more than the actual quality of the humor, etc. Benson is one of the exceptions - this show managed to be genuinely funny during it's original airings, and is still today. The interactions between the characters are hilarious and mostly eschew the ""cheesy"" elements of humor that afflicted many other sitcoms of its era.

All-in-all, I'm glad I got the dvd and will buy more seasons as they are released! I just finished watching the last episode, so now I've seen the entire first season - Marcy just got back from her vacation, hopefully Sony will soon as well, and get Season 2 out to us =)",1203206400,3,850,4.414012738853503

2832524,5,B000Q6GUJS,"I grew up on Benson shows.  I was up all night watching the marathon in May of 2006, when TV land played them back to back.  I realized how much I missed the show, and hoped it would be released on DVD soon.  I hope the other seasons will soon follow.  It's time we get Prime time tv back to shows like this and kick out the reality tv nonsense.  I highly recommend Benson giving it 5 stars, and it's kid-friendly to boot..",1199059200,13,423,4.048192771084337

I have been waiting for Benson to come out on DVD for a long time, and I was NOT disappointed! I guess the only bad thing I could say (and it has NOTHING to do with the show itself) is that I wish they would add more ""Extras"" and bonus features like ""Behind the Scenes"", ""Bloopers"", etc.)  But I am glad to have it anyway.
