590714,5,6303182305,"Have had excellent results in about six weeks and expect to progress more as I do more reps and add heavier weights.  Division between abs/arm exercises just right. Really appreciate low key, absence of noisy music and  yelling.  Very calming. Urge re-release aimed at older age group.  Need  them to give to friends!",938649600,3,317,4.90566037735849

7840398,5,6303182305,I love this VHS workout.  There was an issue with the tape breaking but I was able to fix it and it works great!,1365292800,,112,3.6666666666666665
7840399,5,6303182305,This video was easy to follow and it was about 38 minutes of arms and abs. I bought it mostly for my arms and it is effective. I workout  6 days a week and I would call myself an intermediate.  I thought the arm exercises were good and again no excessive talking or bad music.,1365120000,,276,4.0
7840400,5,6303182305,"This workout is very effective, a great addition to my home library of workouts! Well done TamiLee! And she is so much fun, how could you not enjoy?",1277078400,,148,4.321428571428571
7840401,5,6303182305,"ARMS & ABS OF STEEL requires more commitment than other Tamilee Webb exercise tapes.  Unlike, for example, the fitness instructor's famous BUNS OF STEEL and ABS OF STEEL videos, ARMS & ABS OF STEEL does not offer three 10-minute exercise routines, its 30 minutes one continuous session.  It is of course easier to squeeze in a morning workout with Tamilee when it's ten minutes of ABS OF STEEL.  For ARMS & ABS OF STEEL, you must either get up earlier or wait until the weekend.

Just one other requirement.  If you own no dumbbell-type weights, you'll need to pick up sets of 1-, 3-, and 5-pounds if you're a woman, more if you're a man, depending on how much arm strength you take into this.

ARMS & ABS OF STEEL is a great workout, so obtain the weights and make the time to do it.  The abdominal moves Tamilee Webb teaches combine some of what you know if you have her other abs tapes but include a couple I, for one, did not know.  The arm exercises are all new to me, most rewarding the tricep-building moves.  You'll get a kick out the explanation Tamilee gives as to why biceps are usually bigger than triceps.

Because ARMS & ABS OF STEEL is one of Tamilee Webb's oldest workout tapes, penny-pinching production values abound, just as in her other early videos such as ABS OF STEEL.  The budget guys at  ARMS & ABS OF STEEL would not spring a couple of dollars for a can of insect repellant, for example, so what looks like a horsefly zips about Tamilee, who gamely ignores it as she leads us through arm and abdominal exercises.

I don't blame that fly for hanging around, though, because Tamilee Webb's big beautiful bottom also abounds in ARMS & ABS OF STEEL thanks to the thong bikini/nude stockings outfit she dons. Like slowly building a muscle, Tamilee reveals that remarkable rump of hers in stages, and with a backside like hers, it takes more stages than there are on Broadway to get to the full view.  She starts with fleeting turns to either side in the warm-up, showing just enough to let us know she's wearing yet another sexy thong. Next, resting on her back, profile view, Tamilee takes her legs upright, and while no one's insulting her I do wish she'd turn the other cheek.  Moving to the tricep dip, Tamilee rests her hands on a chair in back of her while lowering her hot hindquarters.  Thank God for what must be men behind (tee-hee) the cameras, as they treat us to some salacious looks at Tamilee's tush as(s) she lowers that rear I revere like a sexy elevator you would like to ride.  But(t) like a great director who knows how to end (tee-hee) the film with a great climax, Tamilee rewards those who don't skip the post-workout stretch by resting face down, picture complete.  It's not a lengthy finish, but(t) with Tamilee Webb's big beautiful bottom, finishing won't take long, at least if you're a guy.",1269820800,,2839,4.522504892367906
7840402,4,6303182305,An excellent workout for the arms. It is very simple to follow and not too hard. The repition could be a bit too much for the intermdiates but anyone can work up to them.,1219363200,,170,4.029411764705882
7840403,5,6303182305,"I started using this tape about three months ago.  I appreciate that it is low key with no blaring music.  Another plus is that there are no fancy moves.

I couldn't finish all the exercises when I started.  Now I finish them all and I work with heavier weights.

I would not have been caught dead in a tank top when I started this workout.  Now I have beatiful bicep muscles.  My tricep muscles are taking a bit longer but are still better.

My abs are also starting to get smaller, a huge plus after three kids.

I LOVE this tape and highly reccomend it.",1178409600,4,556,4.219047619047619
7840404,5,6303182305,"This is a great workout for the upper body. Tamilee Webb really gives a good routine for the upper body and abdominals. She alternates arm workouts and ab workouts. She does a few minutes of arms then a few minutes of abdominals. Tamilee uses a pair of three pound dumbells for the arm exercises. I like to use heavier dumbells for the arm exercises. She also uses a chair for the workout to sit in while doing the arms. She also uses the chair for my favorite part of the video. She does a supper set of tricep dips on the chair. First does a set using both arms,then she gives you a chance to do one arm tricep dips. It is really effective. The abdominal work is all done on the floor. Tamilee really knows what to do for the abs. It is really effective abdominal crunches. It you are a big fan of Tamilee Webb`s Abs of Steel videos. You will also be a fan of this one.",1156204800,3,871,4.129411764705883
7840405,3,6303182305,"I had a few problems with this video.  First of all, the appearance is very dated looking, especially given that Tamilee wears a visor throughout the workout.  The set is very plain, and the production quality is poor.  With respect to the exercises themselves, I'm concerned that some of the moves she does for abs may be bad for the neck.  In Tamilee's more recent videos, she has eliminated these exercises, so I wonder if they are no longer recommended.  The arms workout is good but consists of mostly traditional moves, although Tamilee does add a few twists such as doing a set of bicep curls coming only halfway up instead of a full curl.
I really like Tamilee, but this video is old and not her best.  If you want to try one of Tamilee's more recent arms and abs workouts, I would recommend her Quick Toning Arms and Abs, which consists of 3 15-minute programs, each combining arms and abs work.  She also has several even newer tapes in her ""I Want Those..."" series, which are more challenging.  Although this video does give the arms and abs a pretty good workout, it is out-of-date, and there are better recent choices.",1028851200,21,1131,4.564356435643564
