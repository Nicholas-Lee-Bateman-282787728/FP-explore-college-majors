8436523,5,B004N98T3E,"I own a copy of this video and watched it again this morning. It is really a good one, with human interest
stories and lots of photos of pretty bridges, that I probably will never see in person, since I do not live in New England.
Would recommend this to anyone with an interest in well-built covered bridges, and interviews with those who live nearby,
and love them for many reasons.  Many or most of these bridges are still in use, and are well maintained!!",1424476800,,459,4.4
