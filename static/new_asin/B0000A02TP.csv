1900096,5,B0000A02TP,"A major element in determining the worth of a documentary lies in the quality of the evidence it presents, and, regarding Jack Kerouac, you can't do much better than what the filmmaker does here. The opinions of Ginsberg, Burroughs, Snyder, Corso, Huncke, DiPrima, an ex-wife and daughter are proffered which gives the film tremendous weight and legitimacy. Their observations concerning Jack's character and personality are highly revealing. It is a sad tale, and, if one of the interviewees can be believed, this is a writer who did not believe in suicide so he resolved to drink himself to death which is exactly what he did. Personally, I felt pain gazing at the numerous clips from Firing Line which appeared about a year before he died. He appears to be about 15 years older than he was, and in such a stupor that one longs to hit the fastforward button. Of course, doing so would be dishonest and this documentary is anything but that.",1170547200,9,942,4.785276073619632
1900097,3,B0000A02TP,"""What Ever Happened to Kerouac?"" is a documentary now available on DVD about sporadic creativity enshrouded in decadence, degeneracy, and decay.  It impressionistically recounts the adult life of Jack Kerouac (1922-1969), the literary beat of the ""beat generation.""

The ""Beats"" (circa 1948-1960?) are sometimes cast as proto-hippies:  Bohemian; anti-establishment; aflame with the exotic and taboo; worshippers at the Dionysian fount of creativity; nonconformists-now nihilist, now visionary; poets of the absurd and the profound; idolizers of Charlie Parker's jazz.  Theirs was gut-existentialism and ""Beat Zen,"" Hindu cosmology and nuclear eschatology.  ""To be Beat,"" wrote Kerouac, ""was to be at the bottom of your personality looking up.""  Beat was birthed by the misfits, the downbeat, the offbeat-not by the poor urchins who could manage no more than sleeping in parks and begging money, but by the artistic urchins who gave a voice to their rebellion and (somehow) got published.

Kerouac was arguably magnificent at times-churning out rambling, but poetic prose-despite the fact that he was dubbed by one of the literati as ""a Neanderthal with a typewriter.""  The film is appropriate punctuated by Kerouac reading chunks of prose on ""The Steve Allen Show.""  Kerouac's work was impassioned and original; he invented a genre of continuous, spontaneous narrative seen in novels such as ""The Dharma Bums"" and ""On the Road"" which was written at high speed on a continuous sheet of paper a hundred feet long.  Beat poet Allen Ginsburg called it ""a magnificent single paragraph several blocks long.""

But Kerouac burned bright but briefly, then burned out rapidly, because being Beat meant being a rogue.  As the interviews with family, friends, and acquaintances make plain, Kerouac was a drunk (who drank himself to death), an adulterer, a drug user, and a buddy of more of the same misfits of the day such as William Burroughs (homosexual and junkie), Allen Ginsberg (homosexual and sometimes psychotic), and other assorted thieves, dopers, and thrill-seekers.

But decadence was heralded as transcendence and orgies as oracular.  Cultural critic Carl Raschke notes that ""Kerouac was self-consciously attempting to depict the whirl of sensation as the key to cosmic understanding, as a vehicle of liberation:  though he left little distinction between the liberation of the mind and libertinism of the youthful rake and rebel.""

Decadence was avant-garde, and was touted as the engine of artistry.  But the gaunt, sour, bitter faces of many of his now aged or recently deceased compatriots reveal that debauchery indeed debauches-even debauches the Beats, and especially Kerouac.  Handsome, lithe, and vigorous as a young man, middle age found him to be bloated and beaten beat.

Particularly pathetic are short clips of William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" in 1969.  Buckley presided over the intellectual debris of a quasi-incoherent Kerouac who was asked to consider the relationship between Beats and Hippies.  An unflappable Buckley gracefully withstood Kerouac's juvenile ramblings, seeking to bring coherence out of chaos.  Buckley smiled knowingly.  Kerouac smirked contemptuously-an appropriate Beat response, perhaps.  A rummied out rebel without a cause met a conservative rebel with a cause.  The juxtaposition was telling, almost painful.

Kerouac at his best may have unmasked some of the pretensions of a complacent, self-righteous, post-war America; he may have celebrated elements of life-such as bebop jazz-that were unjustly ignored by others.  But he exacted too high a price.  By going ""on the road"" he deserted the Protestant work ethic that undergirds a productive and healthy culture, exchanging postponed gratification for immediate gratification (and addiction), exchanging hard work for protracted play-and encouraged others to follow suit.  His promiscuity denied the sanctity of the family.  (We see several clips of his abandoned daughter reflecting on her father's life.)  But Kerouac and friends corrupted more than themselves; they inspired a whole counterculture-as William Burroughs notes in the film-that both amplified and refined the Beat spirit of nonconformity, hedonism, and Eastern religious intrigue.  And don't we even hear something of ""the beat"" in the punks?

The film reports that Kerouac said that because he was a Catholic he couldn't commit suicide, so he decided to drink himself to death (which is really gradual suicide).  Although his prose drew inspiration eclectically from Buddhism, Hinduism, and just about anywhere-Beat was nothing if not unsystematic-several friends and his priest tell us that Kerouac was entranced by the crucifix, and painted pictures of Christ and cardinals toward the end.  Yet no conversion was evident-only an alcoholic's eroded body, mind, and soul.  It seemed he never caught the spirit of the one he could not forget.  Jesus said ""seek and you shall find.""  Jack Kerouac must have been looking in all the wrong places.",1141516800,14,5009,5.490861618798956
1900098,4,B0000A02TP,"I think there are two types of successful documentaries.  Great films regardless of subject matter (ie: Ken Burns work, Woodstock, Errol Morris's films) and documentaries that exist because of their subject matter (most of Michael Moore's films, Supersize Me, almost every musician or film star doc). This second group does not necessarily need to be a work of art to be successful.  If you're a fan of the subject, you'll almost inevitably like the film.

For me, this film falls into the 2nd category.  Obviously the subject matter is a no brainer.  Most of Kerouac's contemporaries were still alive.  His daughter and ex's talked on camera.  Lots of footage of Jack himself (looking sharp and at his peak with Steve Allen; drunk, sad and near-death with Buckley). There is also lots of photos and audio of Jack with friends, fellow poets and contemporaries. I'm sure the filmmakers had to whittle down their footage to a managable length.

Another way to judge a documentary is to ask the question: What if I don't know anything about the subject? What portrait does it paint?  Does it make me want to seek out more info on this person, read their books, watch their films, etc.

I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I knew very little about Kerouac before watching the film.  I gravitated more to the work of Charles Bukowski, which some feel (I don't) was part of the Beat movement.  I knew about Kerouac and had thumbed through a couple of his books; I'd even read some of his contemporaries - a little Ginsberg - a lot of William Burroughs.  But knowing little definitely qualifies me to say, yes, the film is very successful in presenting its subject in interesting ways.  I will now have to dig out a copy of On The Road!  What better complement can you give a movie of any kind!

The movie itself moves quickly. It has a great score (that is mostly jazz from Thelonious Monk with a little Charlie Parker) and all of the interviews are fascinating.  It lacks a certain style that would have made it a great film, but the subject matter more than makes up for it.  I believe that fans as well as the ignorant (me included) have an equal chance of enjoying the film.

Unfortunately there are no extra features (other than a trailer - not for this film).  If any film seemed to cry out for extended interviews, complete segments featuring Kerouac or commentary from the filmmakers and even some of the personalities featured on film, this film certainly does!  Perhaps its the age of the film (about 20 years) that prevented that type of material?  However, the lack of features should not sway you from seeing the film.",1113177600,27,2622,4.654347826086957

To actually see most of Kerouac's fellow writer's and poet's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated ""genius"" that was this brother Lowellian is in itself a magnificent production! I bought this DVD today at a mall in New Hampshire and could have bought it for less on Amazon.com! Just a few minutes ago I did order the DVD ""Jack Kerouac-King of the Beats"" on Amazon.com and can't wait for its arrival! If it's anything like ""What Happened To Kerouac?"" then it will surely be another masterful production! After I write this review I am going to watch this DVD again and experience the same chills as I did when initially watching it for the first time! Anyone that is a true fan of Kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius! To hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of Kerouac himself is truly awe-inspiring! This production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is: Jack Kerouac!",1078617600,15,1191,4.622641509433962

1900103,5,B0000A02TP,"This film is filled with in-depth interviews from all of the Beats and includes footage and readings of Kerouac himself, even some from late in his life. Get it for the commentary and the chance to see the personalities of so many influential writers talking about what they know best: themselves. You will learn a lot, especially if you are a writer. The portrait of Kerouac is authentic. It shows all his sides. The interviews have that same feeling of authenticity. There is a little bit of posing but no agendas. They are just telling it like they saw it, then and now. You get to see where Kerouac came from and who he became. The viewer is given the space to make his/her own sense of it: the tragedy and the brilliance.

You will not get a play-by-play coverage of all his novels and writings. You will not get a simple biography from birth to death. It is not about praise. Instead, the focus is on who Kerouac was and what he was about at pivotal periods in his life, which does a 180. You will get Kerouac's priest talking about his crucifix, verbal sparring with Ed Sanders, Corso waxing poetic about minstrels and poets,  Burroughs speaking on fact and fiction, an ex-wife describing his eyes, Ginsberg covering the realities of Kerouac's mother, Neal Cassady smiling, Ferlinghetti being insulted, and the like. This film is filled with humanity and presence. It is a document much like a letter home.",1307664000,3,1413,4.648
1900104,5,B0000A02TP,"I know Jack Kerouac. Oh no, not the way his many ""beat"" writer friends did , at least those still alive at the time of this film's production in 1986 that provided the main ""talking head"" commentary. Gregory Corso (then still a madman of a poet in his own right as shown here in his answers to an interviewer's questions about his take on the great Kerouac's demise), William Burroughs (of ""Naked Lunch"" fame) and super-poet Allen Ginsberg (of ""Howl"" and ""Kaddish"" fame) among others knew him back on those lonely, down-at-the heel, provocative post-World War II New York streets. That is the stuff of legend and well before my time, although I heard the echoes of that struggle in my own youthful efforts to break out of the straightjacket of the 1950s when my time came in the 1960s.

Nor do I know Jack Keroauc from being a latter-day devotee of his spontaneous prose writing style or his standoffish, sideline view of life and consciously apolitical lifestyle, as is embarrassingly emphasized here in a famous segment on William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" public television show where he went out of his boozy way to dump on the counter-cultural movement (""hippies"", okay) of the 1960s. From early on in my youth I was more likely to be immersed in reading things like ""The Communist Manifesto"" (if only to dismiss it out of hand-then) and had no time for reading a ""beat"" travelogue like ""On The Road"" although I was personally struggling along those same lines to `find myself' (sound familiar ?) . Later I would devour the thing (repeatedly) along with the rest of his major works like ""Dharma Bums', Visions Of Cody"". ""Big Sur"", ""Doctor Sax"" and others.

Here is how I do know Jack Kerouac. I know, like Kerouac did as well, as a youth painfully but now with a sense of deep pride, what being from the lower edges of the working class was all about. One does not easily shake off the slow incremental deathblows to the psyche of avoiding authority, avoiding challenges to the status quo, avoiding failure by being a non-starter and most of all avoiding negative public (read neighborhood) notice. I, moreover, know, physically and emotionally, the very constricted ethos of the old time New England mill towns and the working class quarters of Manchester, New Hampshire, Saco, Maine and in Massachusetts Waltham, Lawrence, Quincy and Jack's own beloved mill town of Lowell. Without going into great detail, after all this review is about Kerouac, I know in great personal detail the effects of that clannish French-Canadian and Gallic Catholic cultural gradient as it worked it way through the working class base of many of those mill towns. Some of that detailed knowledge of mine is directly linked to the city of Lowell that factors so much into Kerouac's life and writings (and death, the city has a small urban park named after him in the center of town and people, I am told, still go to visit his grave there).

Most of all, though, I know Jack Kerouac because a generation, more or less, after him I was, like a million others who formed the ""Generation of `68"", taking to the `road', some road, in search of personal destiny, greater consciousness, some political wisdom, the truth or just trying to get out of the family house. The previously disdained apolitical ""On The Road"" became something of a personal bible for me , as like Whitman before him Kerouac tried to do by interior monologue, but more importantly, by physically putting some space between the here of whatever was bothering him and the there of some inner peace (that he, at least, never found). The road I took then, or later, was not Jack's road. Or Dean Moriarty's road. But, thanks Jack for ""On The Road"", ""The Dharma Bums"", ""Doctor Sax"", ""Visions of Cody"" and a bunch of other books that got me through many a sleepless night.

But enough of that. We are, after, all reviewing a documentary that has as it underlying premise an analysis of Kerouac's retreat to the sidelines (which is the reason that word forms part of the headline for this entry), as ""king of the beats"" writer and as something more than a conveniently symbolic media celebrity. This one and one half hour production goes through the main events of Kerouac's life: the driven handsome athletic youth; the star-struck and searching Columbia University student: the budding frenetic writer who, luckily, very luckily I would say, met some kindred spirits like Allen Ginsberg, the ""drugstore cowboy"" William Burroughs, and a host of others in New York City in the mid-1940s and never looked back. Critically important also are the subsequent travels west hitching up with Neal Cassidy (the model for Dean Moriarty), Gary Snyder, Gregory Corso and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

However, as many of the commentators in the documentary attest to, it was always about the writing for Jack, that compulsive need to put out as many ideas as his hand (or typewriter) could produce before exhaustion set in. That, ominously, meant keeping it fresh, keeping it real under the ""laws"" the spontaneous writing method. Once Keroauc got some notice, in short, when ""On The Road"" finally got published, and he, for good or evil, fell into the clutches of the great media maw of that day (nothing, by the way, from what appeared in this film compared to today's 24/7 blitz that would have really done him in earlier) he began to decline.

As media-proclaimed `leader' of the ""beats"" (and, in retrospect, he really was the most talented and original of the lot) all those old time mill town anxieties, drawing on generations of suffering ignoble anonymity, the wheels, driven as well by that old devil alcohol , came off. The effects of that cloistered, repressed working class youth, as surely as if he had spent thirty years in the mills, began to take its toll. Moreover, a recent re-reading of some of ""Dharma Bums"" gives at least some clue to what happened to this superior and innovative writer. He was, as the work that is remembered today will attest to, a young writer writing for the young about youthful experiences. There is only so much fresh inner-directed material that that market can absorb from one writer. The aging media celebrity Kerouac became, sadly, could not, or would not, face the fact of aging and shift gears. I have already given my kudos above for the youthful work of his. That will have to do here.

Note: For those who never heard, or hear, the `beat' of the ""beats"" the whole mood of this documentary puts you in a time capsule back to those times musically with some very evocative jazz of the period and visually with great footage of post-war neon lit New York and San Francisco (as well as footage from hometown Lowell with some street scenes of old time residents that only add to some of my points made above). Best of all are the segments of Kerouac reading from ""On The Road"" and other materials. They evoke the feeling of some smoky, boozy nightspot. These works were, after all, written under the sign of the burgeoning 1940s and 1950s jazz scene and with the idea of presenting the works orally as well as on the page. Nice, especially one segment with 1950s comedian and talk show host Steve Allen on piano.",1252713600,6,7188,4.759422614274258
1900105,4,B0000A02TP,"I got into Kerouac by way of my interest in Neal Cassady, whom I can't really remember how I discovered. (I have yet to read ""On the Road"" but am familiar with Jack's prose style through spoken word recordings.)  Anyway, I came to this doc more from an interest in the person than his work, which I think is common to a lot of people who love the Beats. Their personas are as much a part of their legend as anything they wrote.

That said, Jack looks like a troubled boy even in his best clips here, which are undoubtedly the earlier ones on the Steve Allen Show--probably in part because he was in what he perceived to be a sympathetic environment and therefore felt at liberty to indulge his playful and vulnerable side. He is in fact most touching as he reads excerpts from ""On the Road"". He is also a ruggedly handsome and charismatic figure, although his tendency for brooding and blustering is apparent even here. Far less flattering is his appearance on a later talk show, aptly titled ""Firing Line"" in which ,visibly drunk, he (understandably) reacts defensively and plays the fool to host William Buckley's cross examiner. This was only a year and a half before Jack's premature death from alcoholism, and he seems too beleagured with complexes to get out anything coherent. He seems to be trapped in a subjective hell wherein he believes everything and everyone to be part of some ""organized effort to ignore him"".

As a younger man however, his appeal--both personal and literary-- is obvious. He got American literature out of its stodgy rut,  writing in bold, Hemingway-like strokes, blending narrative fiction with poetry off the top of his head in what was to be called ""spontaneous prose"". As one of his contemporaries points out in the interviews, this was a wildly adventurous choice to make in the fifties/sixties, from a man who could ""write any way you want"" but chose the road less travelled because that's where his passion was.

Neal Cassady is seen briefly in a clip filmed at A Different Light Bookstore, San Francisco in 1965. He appears with Allen Ginsberg, who is clearly enamored of him. Neal, as everyone knows, was Jack's muse/alter ego, the inspiration for the character of Dean Moriarty in ""On the Road"", and--according to many of his contemporaries--a kind of genius in his own right. However, nothing he says in this clip made any sense to me at all--and even Ginsberg seems at a loss to communicate with him. He too seems lost in his own head, trapped in some internal dialogue with himself.  Still, it's easy to see how he could draw people in and inspire them. He had that alpha energy that makes things go. Mix it with good looks and charisma and you've got a cult! The cult of Neal. I think in some ways Jack was brooding because he wasn't Neal. Neal was the doer, and Jack was the observer/commentator, and one can never be the other, although each usually longs to be.

Carolyn Cassady--Neal's wife of 20 years, is unexpectedly good-humored and funny to listen to. Poor Carolyn was--for awhile, at least-- the anchor that kept Neal from floating into the outer stratospheres. Compared to Jack and Neal, her solidity and insistence on at least an operating level of convention make her a heavy in most books about the Beats, but it's clear from this interview that she was simply SANE. Pretty even in old age, with unbelievably beautiful blue eyes that still twinkle when she reminisces on Neal and her affair with Kerouac, she proves herself humorous, resilient and every inch their intellectual equal. She must also have been remarkably patient to deal with these two exasperating egotists, not to mention sporadic sexual meddling with her husband by Ginsberg. Somebody give this lady a medal!

In the end, this is a good doc for anyone interested in its subjects--it's a little heavy with talking heads and light on vintage footage, but all in all compelling, illuminating and worthwhile.",1231113600,5,3933,4.765051395007342
1900106,5,B0000A02TP,"Not much exists in the way of documentaries about the father of the Beat Generation, Jack Kerouac. But it's not for a lack of interest for sure. I think the bulk of people that have seen this may have either rented it from a library or have seen it re-run on your local PBS channel. The quality of the film doesn't lend itself to the digital age very well, as the presentation of the interviews and the facts about the life of one of America's greatest writers is handled in a very film-school type of fashion.

I don't mean to denigrate this documentary at all with that last statement, but the quality of the presentation is just as rough as the actual archive footage. Only the presentation can be weighed in the sense of filmmaking, but in truth it is what it is. It's not slick, it's not polished, it's not even artful like the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bukowski-Documentary/dp/B000E8N8L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bukowski Documentary</a>, but it is fascinating, intelligent, absorbing and powerful to watch.

As most may know, Jack Kerouac drank himself into the grave in the late sixties, for reasons known and unknown. The weight he carried was a significant one that pushed him as deep into himself as he could go until his inner body could no longer sustain him. A lot of the troubled history of Kerouac is fleshed out as well as his stomping grounds, his old lovers, his daughter, some of his friends and other contemporaries.

The interview with Gregory Corso is a fascinating one to say the least and one can understand why the man decided to turn to teaching literature. The way he tells the stories and the stories themselves are powerful in his hands as he speaks highly and respectfully of Kerouac and in way in which a true friend who never left his side would.

This is a very touching and personal, albeit rough, look into the life and times of one of America's most compelling writers of the last age.  While you may complain about the unmastered archive footage, you'll be amazed at the segment with Steve Allen, the interview with William F. Buckley, where Jack is drunk on air, and so on.

This is a very enjoyable and well worth the time spent.

From the lighting to the boring and overly long interviews this is a documentary in need of some good editing and a director who knows something about making an interesting film.  It appears the director has no idea how to shoot an interesting and decent looking documentary.  Just pointing a camera at poorly lit people and letting them ramble on with no editing does not make for an interesting film.

I was disappointed, and I tried hard not to be, reading ""On the Road"". I found myself agreeing, and I tried hard not to, with Truman Capote who said Kerouac didn't write, he typed.

This film has made me give Kerouac another chance. (Will it be ""Big Sur"" or ""Doctor Sax"" or ""Tristessa""?) This excellent documentary has convinced me that Kerouac was more than a drunk (Even though one of the most interesting scenes has a drunken Kerouac telling William F. Buckley to hurry the question up.) and more than a typist (There were scenes where excerpts of Kerouac's stuff--other than ""On the Road""--were read during photo montages, first, of big city life and, later, of Lowell, MA.)

The film also shows how literate, articulate, and compassionate these original beatniks were. How can one listen to Allen Ginsberg here and not be impressed with his warmth and his storytelling, regardless of what one thinks of his persona or his poetry? These beatniks were not just a group of young adults in the 1940's fueled by chemicals and hormones. There really was (perhaps only at times) a seeking for spirit and beauty and truth.

1900110,4,B0000A02TP,"I slipped this 1986 production in my DVD player a couple of nights ago after the wife and kids had fallen asleep, and while the trains to and from Tokyo roared by a hop skip and a jump away, and things were high-rise and pretty much all about the future outside my midnight window, I took a trip back in time to c. 1959 America.  The first major point I want to make about this DVD is that it contains a young, electrifyingly handsome Kerouac doing his famous reading from On the Road.  If this DVD contained only that clip, it would be worth the price.  In fact, as the show proceeded, I found myself wishing that this clip was the only thing on the DVD, with options on speeding it up, slowing it down, listening only to the audio, perhaps having it simultaneously translated into Japanese (for friends who might drop by), French, Italian, and--what the heck--Mandarin too.  The rest of the DVD outside of cameo appearances by a well-embalmed Huncke, an articulate Ann Charters, a righteous Diane di Prima, a super sound-byte by Creeley, an impressive Carolyn Cassady, a spookily laconic Burroughs, and a prim discussion by Snyder, was rather depressing.  We see Neal Cassady a tick after his prime saying little but saying it quickly, a post-stroke Allen Ginsberg getting sly revenge on Jack's mother, and the trickster antics of Gregory Corso, gumming his words like an old drunk in your home-town bar, holding forth like (see previous), urged on to greater mental triangulations by the off-screen producer, and finally making a weird kind of sense.  Joyce Johnson reminisces about Jack on the eve of his On The Road fame.  One of Jack's wives tells it like it was (she couldn't deal with dirty bathtubs, so she went home), and the secret star of the show--Jack's wonderfully charismatic daughter Jan--also a writer--and beautiful--but doomed to die young--tells about compairing hand sizes with her pixilated dad while he watched the Beverly Hillbillies on television.  Which brings up the painful parts of the video--almost as painful to me as watching a drunk Bukowski trying to kick his girlfriend in another DVD I saw recently--Jack being stupid on the William F. Buckley show, and Buckley egging him on, complete with snaky asides while a young, earnest Ed Sanders sits like an angel two seats down and is never really allowed to say much of anything.  Jack comes across as a bully reeking of sweat and urine, hopeless, a soon-to-die wreck of what he was in the other clip.  Gregory Corso at last fills the screen like the Fool in King Lear, however--wiser than his masters and mistresses--to really spell it out: success got Kerouac.  All those people who wanted to tear off a piece of him for a souvenir, or buy him a gun to shoot himself with so they could say they'd done the deed later in case the camera crews came around, or buy him a drink, which was essentially the same thing as a gun--to kill his already gone beauty even more than it had been done in by much hard-living, drugs and many toasts to the moon.

I bought it for my cousin who was doing a term paper on Jack Kerouac and he wondered after watching half the DVD if he wanted to write on such a boring person.  But, anyone who knows anything about Kerouac knows he was not boring, he was facsinating!  Look elswhere if you want to know more.

7994943,4,B0000A02TP,"The deluxe version is a fine deal, which essentially gives you a double documentary. The 2nd documentary is mostly an assemblage of outtakes. Some clips on disc 2 are more interesting than what was included in the original film. Both documentaries delve very little into artistry or process, which I would have preferred. If you want to hear Kerouac's colleagues tell a few stories and talk about what he was like, this is a fine document. My favorite clip is Ann Charters discussing how she got to know Kerouac when she was creating a bibliography of his work in the mid-1960s. This is the last clip at the end of the 2nd disc. Overall, it's a great bang for the buck and fairly engaging. However, if you want to get into Jack the artist, Joyce Johnson's ""The Voice Is All"" (I listened to the Audible version) is the source.",1458691200,,825,4.543624161073826

It's put together in such a way as to try and replicate the sights, sounds and feel of Kerouac's time. It generally follows his life and ultimate demise focusing on key highlights include TV interviews and timelines for his books. There's sort of a pathos throughout given his personal demons and ultimate drinking problem.

7994948,3,B0000A02TP,"""What Ever Happened to Kerouac?"" is a documentary now available on DVD about sporadic creativity enshrouded in decadence, degeneracy, and decay. It impressionistically recounts the adult life of Jack Kerouac (1922-1969), the literary beat of the ""beat generation.""

The ""Beats"" (circa 1948-1960?) are sometimes cast as proto-hippies: Bohemian; anti-establishment; aflame with the exotic and taboo; worshippers at the Dionysian fount of creativity; nonconformists-now nihilist, now visionary; poets of the absurd and the profound; idolizers of Charlie Parker's jazz. Theirs was gut-existentialism and ""Beat Zen,"" Hindu cosmology and nuclear eschatology. ""To be Beat,"" wrote Kerouac, ""was to be at the bottom of your personality looking up."" Beat was birthed by the misfits, the downbeat, the offbeat-not by the poor urchins who could manage no more than sleeping in parks and begging money, but by the artistic urchins who gave a voice to their rebellion and (somehow) got published.

Kerouac was arguably magnificent at times-churning out rambling, but poetic prose-despite the fact that he was dubbed by one of the literati as ""a Neanderthal with a typewriter."" The film is appropriate punctuated by Kerouac reading chunks of prose on ""The Steve Allen Show."" Kerouac's work was impassioned and original; he invented a genre of continuous, spontaneous narrative seen in novels such as ""The Dharma Bums"" and ""On the Road"" which was written at high speed on a continuous sheet of paper a hundred feet long. Beat poet Allen Ginsburg called it ""a magnificent single paragraph several blocks long.""

But Kerouac burned bright but briefly, then burned out rapidly, because being Beat meant being a rogue. As the interviews with family, friends, and acquaintances make plain, Kerouac was a drunk (who drank himself to death), an adulterer, a drug user, and a buddy of more of the same misfits of the day such as William Burroughs (homosexual and junkie), Allen Ginsberg (homosexual and sometimes psychotic), and other assorted thieves, dopers, and thrill-seekers.

But decadence was heralded as transcendence and orgies as oracular. Cultural critic Carl Raschke notes that ""Kerouac was self-consciously attempting to depict the whirl of sensation as the key to cosmic understanding, as a vehicle of liberation: though he left little distinction between the liberation of the mind and libertinism of the youthful rake and rebel.""

Decadence was avant-garde, and was touted as the engine of artistry. But the gaunt, sour, bitter faces of many of his now aged or recently deceased compatriots reveal that debauchery indeed debauches-even debauches the Beats, and especially Kerouac. Handsome, lithe, and vigorous as a young man, middle age found him to be bloated and beaten beat.

Particularly pathetic are short clips of William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line"" in 1969. Buckley presided over the intellectual debris of a quasi-incoherent Kerouac who was asked to consider therelationship between Beats and Hippies. An unflappable Buckley gracefully withstood Kerouac's juvenile ramblings, seeking to bring coherence out of chaos. Buckley smiled knowingly. Kerouac smirked contemptuously-an appropriate Beat response, perhaps. A rummied out rebel without a cause met a conservative rebel with a cause. The juxtaposition was telling, almost painful.

Kerouac at his best may have unmasked some of the pretensions of a complacent, self-righteous, post-war America; he may have celebrated elements of life-such as bebop jazz-that were unjustly ignored by others. But he exacted too high a price. By going ""on the road"" he deserted the Protestant work ethic that undergirds a productive and healthy culture, exchanging postponed gratification for immediate gratification (and addiction), exchanging hard work for protracted play-and encouraged others to follow suit. His promiscuity denied the sanctity of the family. (We see several clips of his abandoned daughter reflecting on her father's life.) But Kerouac and friends corrupted more than themselves; they inspired a whole counterculture-as William Burroughs notes in the film-that both amplified and refined the Beat spirit of nonconformity, hedonism, and Eastern religious intrigue. And don't we even hear something of ""the beat"" in the punks?

The film reports that Kerouac said that because he was a Catholic he couldn't commit suicide, so he decided to drink himself to death (which is really gradual suicide). Although his prose drew inspiration eclectically from Buddhism, Hinduism, and just about anywhere-Beat was nothing if not unsystematic-several friends and his priest tell us that Kerouac was entranced by the crucifix, and painted pictures of Christ and cardinals toward the end. Yet no conversion was evident-only an alcoholic's eroded body, mind, and soul. It seemed he never caught the spirit of the one he could not forget. Jesus said ""seek and you shall find."" Jack Kerouac must have been looking in all the wrong places.",1362528000,4,4978,5.4980392156862745
