4099397,5,B0039ZBM3C,"Life After People: Complete Season 2 on Blu-Ray
10 Episodes on 2 Discs, released Tuesday, July 27

If you liked ""2012"" and don't mind having it happen a little slower, check out ""Life After People."" It's a series that clarifies at the beginning of every episode that it does not know what would possibly wipe out all of humanity at once, but if everyone suddenly disappeared tomorrow, here are what the effects might be. It mostly follows the destruction of man-made architecture, objects, art, food, pets, and animals taking over.

There are two things that make this series great. One is the overly dramatic narrator who always puts things into perspective. He compares the destruction of a building or food going to waste as ""perishing"" or being murdered. It isn't the ""end of"" or ""downfall of"" any one thing, but a much more emotional response such as ""the death of"" or comments like ""this kitchen where no meal will ever be prepared again."" The narrator personifies inanimate objects by giving them emotions so that we too will be crushed if a building collapses.

The other aspect that makes this series thoroughly entertaining is the amazing CGI effects simulating what specific buildings falling down or exploding or flooding would look like in all its Blu-Ray glory. I watch entire episodes just for glimpses of this destruction to get my ""2012""-like fix of disaster! The sequences are short, few, and far-between but definitely satisfy the need. Watching sequences of grass growing over highways in the city reminds me so much of ""I Am Legend"" and other CGI-friendly aftermath of destruction films.

One of the most interesting and also horrifying episodes is one based on what would happen to food as well as food-themed art and architecture. If mankind just wasn't there tomorrow, all the food would be in grocery stores, in restaurants, in houses, and unpicked on fields. Yes, produce gets rotten and grows mold. Rats move in. More disturbingly, is the revelation of the insect count within our canned goods BEFORE people disappeared and how that effects its ability to last. Frighteningly, there are a few foods that if kept undisturbed in their wrappers or containers can last for a thousand years. Eww. For some reason, pooled into this episode are what would happen to the famous painting ""The Last Supper"" over time as well as a giant metal donut perched on top of a donut shop.

Different historians, theorists, and scientists jump in to offer explanations for how things would go and the reasoning behind it. The show is smart not to offer a specific theory of how mankind would suddenly not be there, but sometimes entire episodes would be obsolete if certain scenarios occurred. For example, the episode on food would be pointless if mankind went extinct somehow through starvation and LACK of food and there would be none sitting around to go through all the decomposition.

There is a message here somewhere about waste and value and not taking things for granted but I think the take home message is ""Life After People -- It goes on and maybe the Earth is happier without us screwing things up!"" It's interesting for the visually stimulated, intellectually curious, and those of us who just get a kick out of destruction. Since it's Season 2, there must be no shortage of themes to talk about!

4099412,5,B0039ZBM3C,"Worth every penny! I specifically purchased this for the ""Last Supper"" to show my biology classes. But there is so much more that applies across the curriculum. The students were fascinated - and appalled by the information about FDA allowed insect parts in our packaged and processed foods. I also had some groans when I suggested they buy some 'cream-filled cakes' now to give their grandkids for Christmas...",1422921600,,411,5.0588235294117645

4099421,5,B0039ZBM3C,"I would love to be the last person left on earth and see this all happen with. My own eyes.
Reply magnificent.",1402272000,,110,4.045454545454546
4099422,5,B0039ZBM3C,"We all thoroughly enjoyed watching this for the second time, the first being as it originally aired.  It was very informative.",1401148800,,126,5.0

4099424,5,B0039ZBM3C,"If you like movies like, ""The last man on Earth, or the more recent remake, ""I Am Legend"" (sans the mutated vampire Humans) then you'll love this series. I bought this for my wife, and it's a series we both enjoy. The special effects are well done and the narrators through the series (James Lurie and Steven S. Ross) keep you interested all the way through. Eerie, informative and thought provoking. If you ever wanted to know the details of what would become of our majestic creations when there's no one to maintain them, you'll get your answers in this. The future outside world of ""Logan's Run - 1976"" will seem quite real after watching ""Life After People"". Mother Nature was here before us and she'll reclaim her throne once we're gone.",1385251200,,743,4.636363636363637
4099425,5,B0039ZBM3C,"A great series that show how man dominates nature at this point of our existence. Without man nature would take it all back in a few hundred years, they show this using actual instances of man abandoning towns, homes and water projects.",1383609600,,236,4.642857142857143
4099426,4,B0039ZBM3C,"I found some of the scenarios intriguing.
It is a series of possible outcomes of what would happen if all the people on earth just disappeared one day.",1376784000,,151,4.428571428571429
4099427,5,B0039ZBM3C,started watching this show when the series started on TV and loved it. Bought it so so that my husband and I can watch it together,1372550400,,130,4.038461538461538
4099428,5,B0039ZBM3C,"loved it when I saw it on TV and had to have it for my personal collection. It realy makes you think or what CAN and could actually happen .Some people are quite upset after watching this series. Its not what will happen, just what may happen. The realism of the series production and the narrations make it riveting watching",1370044800,,325,4.433333333333334
4099429,5,B0039ZBM3C,"This is about entropy, clean and simple. This series does not involve itself with humanity, but rather what happens to the things we would leave behind, and how well would nature reclaim everything. It uses certain landmark things, places and buldings as  prime examples of how things would decay and how well they would crumble away to nothing, returning to the earth once humanity's influence faded away. It's a sobering thought about any future in which we are not involved.",1369526400,,477,4.9625
4099430,5,B0039ZBM3C,"I can't say enough positive about this series.

Ask yourself:  What would happen to the possessions I leave behind? I've moved to a new house, and my sad realization is that 95% of what I own I never use. Maybe 98%.

In other words I could toss nearly everything.

What is it about this surplus of material possessions we have?

And what happens to it after we are gone?

The History Channel tries to show the answers, using expert guesses about the future, and commentary about the actual past. Like the Salton Sea. From 15,000 residents in the 70s to a few hundred today.

I think I will vacation there in the Salton Sea, soon-- and see the future of Palm Springs?",1368662400,,666,4.409836065573771

4099432,4,B0039ZBM3C,Great series about what happens to our world if we all vanished.  shows our our world will break down if we were not there to do all the the upkeep that we sometimes over look.,1361750400,,176,4.0285714285714285

4099434,5,B0039ZBM3C,"My husband likes this show a lot. He often misses it because of work. This is one way for him to take them along.

4099438,4,B0039ZBM3C,"My husband and I could not take this series seriously because of the overly dramatic narrator and the hilariously written script he read, loaded with deliciously bad puns. That didn't stop us from loving it though. If you want a smattering of history wedged between funny, over the top, dramatic one liners, you'll love this series. I've noticed other reviewers commenting that those who loved the 2012 film will like this and I have to agree. (We found that film comic too!)",1302652800,,475,4.804878048780488
