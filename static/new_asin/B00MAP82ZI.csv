6566974,5,B00MAP82ZI,"I enjoyed watching this movie because it wasn't ""over produced"" and the star is just a regular (albeit very fit) Irish guy who takes on the challenge because of his father's recent heart attack. His point is that even though his father is trim and outwardly healthy, something in the environment contributed to the metabolic ill-health, and the star wanted to discover what and why, and you may be surprised what diet he did try.",1412121600,9,429,4.733333333333333

6566977,5,B00MAP82ZI,What an eye opener!! We've been cheated out of our health for years and now somebody has taken the stance to proof all the conventional wisdom crooks wrong. The food and pharmaceutical industry is making a fortune and a killing out of the public!! Well if everybody watch this movie the world will all become a better place............!!,1408406400,15,337,4.827586206896552
6566978,5,B00MAP82ZI,"Just watch it. Don't dismiss it out of hand. Kind of hard to given the results. If you want the science of how it happens that you can scoff down fat all day, and LOSE weight, even when you are rake thin to start like Donal, read Good Calories Bad Calories, or How We Get Fat by Gary Taubes. If you understand the science, but don't understand how it happened, read The Big Fat Surprise by Nina Teicholz. If you understand the lot, well, watch this again just to make sure. Just in case you think this fringe stuff, ask the Australian cricket team how they went after they started eating this way :) Then finish it all up by reading Tim Noakes' great cook book. This is how we all ate anyway before a bunch of scientists decided that they knew more than Mother Nature. Go Donal!",1408406400,35,778,4.263513513513513
6566979,5,B00MAP82ZI,"Done in layman terms with a ""YOU CAN DO THIS  TOO"" sensibility.  I highly recommend.

6566980,5,B00MAP82ZI,"...as noted by the previous reviewer, this is an absolute must-see.  The science of healthy eating is very much a re-emerging one - things that were accepted and correct 50 years ago have been overwhelmed for decades by an ""irrational exuberance"", typified by the obsession with cholesterol and the demonization of saturated fat, while promoting hyperinsulemic, lectin-loaded human-unsuitable grains.  This was an inversion of the scientific method - putting simplistic observations ahead of critical thinking, fuelled by the industry that sprang up around the emerging absurdity.  Well now the true science is coming home - and Donal, Prof Noakes et al are joining the zeitgeist, with an informative and scientifically correct, approachable and highly entertaining analysis of what it takes to be truly healthy - prepare to have those ocular organs opened - and enjoy the experience!

Want to spread the word and address our obesity epidemic, then watch and learn.  Not forgetting you get to eat bacon & eggs guilt free, what's not to love!

6566986,5,B00MAP82ZI,"Cereal Killers is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen!  Donal O'Neill and Professor Tim Noakes are courageous and brilliant!  If you suspect you may have been led astray by current dietary guidelines and you follow Donal's meal plan you can regain your health in a few months.  I tried it and I lost 25 pounds, got rid of arthritis and had perfect blood work for the first time in my life.  Professor Noakes book, The Real Meal Revolution is out soon in the states: pre-order on Amazon.

Thanks to the success of this film, the Low Carb/High Fat (LCHF) Summit is in Cape Town February 19-22, 2015 and the list of speakers is INCREDIBLE:

Dr. Stephen Phinney (MD & PhD) author of The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living (co-authored with Jeff Volek PhD, RD)
Dr. Eric Westman (MD from Duke) author of The New Atkins for a New You (co-authored with Dr. Phinney)
Dr. Michael Eades author of Protein Power and The 30-Day Low Carb Diet Solution (co-authored with M.D. Eades)
Dr. Jay Wortman who has made the fabulous documentary My Big Fat Diet
Dr. Aseem Malhotra a cardiologist from the UK who supports LCHF for optimal heart health
Gary Taubes, science writer who has written the books Good Calories, Bad Calories and Why We Get Fat

Cereal Killers documents the health journeys of both O'Neill and Noakes and their stories have attracted the attention of the world's experts on health and nutrition science.  I bought 5 copies of this movie and I highly recommend the books above if you are interested in optimal health.  O'Neill, Noakes, Phinney, Volek, Westman, Eades, Wortman, Taubes and Malhotra are collectively laying the foundation for a turning point in our evolution where humans return to eating ancestral foods and avoid the majority of debilitating and chronic diseases.

Bravo, Cape Crusaders!!  This film will change your life!",1423872000,7,1856,4.823343848580442

(edit) - Just checking back in.  Since moving to a low carb, high fat diet in December, I've lost about 8kg over the last 5 months or so, with a bit more to go.  Never felt better, seriously.  For those interested, also recommend Wheat Belly book by William Davies.",1418428800,3,372,4.411764705882353

I hired this documentary then immediately bought a copy. Have re watched it. If you want to lose weight, get healthy, avoid disease, or improve your fitness eat your fats and reduce your exercise regime!!! Everything you've been told about diet an exercise is wrong!!

8671184,5,B00MAP82ZI,"Terrific movie.  Teaches us about human metabolism.  ""Good fats"" can be beneficial to us.  Clearly, over-consumption of carbohydrates is more damaging than advertisers want us to know.  Grass fed beef, organic eggs, grain fed poultry will give us the best omega fats in the proteins.  The follow-up movie ""Run on Fat"" follows this movie well and shows a world class athlete who functions very well on a more fat laden diet.  Very worth investigating.  Interesting information on diabetes developing in athletes who have done heavy carb-loading before athletic events.",1442793600,3,567,5.303370786516854
