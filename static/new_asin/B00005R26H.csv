1652571,5,B00005R26H,"I had the pleasure of watching this excellent movie
on the Late Show, one week after ABC broadcasted
`The Stranger Within' on its `Movie of the Week'
in October 1974 . As a kid growing up in the 1970s,
I had a deep crush on Barbara Eden. I thought she was
the most beautiful woman in Hollywood. Forty years
later, I still love Barbara Eden, who in the `Woman
Hunter', portrayed a gorgeous, but, troubled heiress
to her father's massive fortune. Dina, (Barbara Eden),
is recovering from an automobile accident in which a
man was killed. The movie takes place in the awesome
backdrop of Acapulco. Dina is on vacation with her
husband , Jerry (Robert Vaughn), a ruthless entrepreneur.
Dina, during a stroll upon the beach, meets Paul Carter
(Stuart Whitman), a professional artist, who would like
to paint Dina's portrait (stark naked, and dripping with
her jewelry). Dina's instability pushes her closer to
Paul. She soon suspects Paul is a psychotic killer,
responsible for a series of brutal international jewel
robberies and murders. Dina suspects that Paul is
setting her up to be his next victim; however, she
cannot make the police believe her. This is a typical
`Made for Television' 1970s' flick with a strange twist
in the end. Barbara Eden is beautiful, and gives an
excellent performance as a troubled heiress. Vaughn
is perfect as her opportunistic hubby, and Whitman's
wit and `bad' guy persona are brilliant. I love this
movie, and pleased it is on DVD. It is a favorite in my
movie library. Years after this flick, we vacationed in
Acapulco. In my opinion, it is one of the most alluring
places on this planet.",1293580800,7,1623,4.779359430604982
1652572,5,B00005R26H,"Pretty good movies, even though they are definitely ""1970's"" action.
DVD was a little ""fuzzy"" at times, but considering they were probably ""made for TV"" movies, the transition to DVD was done quite well.",1280620800,3,203,5.0
1652573,4,B00005R26H,"I must confess I'm not a huge Barbara Eden fan but I really like this movie.  I bought it not having ever seen it, because it was cheap and I am interested in the Seventies made-for TV genre and I was pleasantly surprised.  The house featured in the movie has to be one of the coolest locations ever, like something out of an old James Bond movie.  Barbara Eden has some sexy swingin' seventies outfits, Robert Vaughn delivers the goods as usual, and I was surprised to see Whitman still vital and young looking, I thought he was older by the time this was made.  Larry Storch is out of control as a boorish drunk.  Lots of fun.

Definitely worth a look if you like Seventies made-for-TV movies, especially if you like Barbara Eden. I've watched my copy twice already.",1279756800,3,768,4.45
1652574,3,B00005R26H,"I am a fan of Barbara Eden, who is a truly natural beauty.  Unfortunately, this movie is pretty flat and even the surprises are formulaic.  There is a suspicious though seductive guy watching her during a moment of marriage tension, she is still traumatized from an auto accident, and no one will listen to her fears.  Of course, it isn't what it appears to be, or not completely, etc.  The movie is pleasant enough, but kind of a bore.",1196899200,,436,4.481012658227848
1652575,4,B00005R26H,"This is probably Barbara Edens best movie.  She's not famous for great movies, but this is my favorite, because she looks HOT!  If you like her as Jeannie, as I do, you will like her in The Woman Hunter.  She still looks like Jeannie in this one, and we get to see her in several sexy outfits, including a bikini, navel and all!!  Very Hot!  Oh, the movie is OK, too.  Kind of a, Who is the Killer, murder mystery type.  But the only reason to get the movie is, The Sexy Barbara Eden!!  You won't be sorry.  She's HOT!!",1141689600,23,519,4.11
1652576,5,B00005R26H,"An enjoyable TV movie from 1972 which gives Barbara Eden a chance to show her curves as well as her acting talent. She is well supported by Robert Vaughn and Stuart Whitman and the locations are also easy on the eye. The DVD print is excellent and the cover art really captures the essence of the film.
Although only a mere 70 minutes in length, it is still an entertaining story.",1064620800,12,380,4.366197183098592
1652577,5,B00005R26H,"this film is terrific to the end,Barbara Eden gives 100% in everything she does.",1038873600,6,80,4.785714285714286
1652578,4,B00005R26H,"Barbara Eden plays a wealthy--but mentally unstable--woman who suspects that a man is a jewel thief and killer, but nobody will believe her! Finally! I had been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time! I remember watching it in reruns sometime during the mid 1980s on my local station's afternoon movie. I'm so glad that its finally available. This is one of Barbara Eden's first TV movies after ""I Dream of Jeannie"" was cancelled. If your a fan of Barbara Eden, and have seen every episode of  ""Jeannie"" a dozen times or so, like I have,  then this is the tape for you! Barbara is one hot mama parading around beautiful scenic Mexico in a variety of skimpy bare midriff outfits that showcase her dynamic figure. There is also a great scene of Barbara struttin' her stuff  on the dance floor. This movie also gives Barbara a chance to show off her  dramatic skills as well. I found her character, Dina, to be distant and  aloof at times, yet always seductive--not at all like her ditzy Jeannie  role. A good departure for her. I guess this is what you would call a ""star-vehicle."" Non-fans of Barbara will probably be bored  watching this tape. The story is your typical slow-moving 70s tv movie with the obligatory climax before each commercial break, and doesn't pick up speed until the last third of the movie. However, the ending did surprise me I  must say. This is (was) a hard to find TV movie. A must have for every Barbara  Eden fan! (...)I recently picked up a dvd copy of this film and the print is much more crisp and clean than my old vhs version!",957916800,23,1569,4.458041958041958
1652579,3,B00005R26H,"As a huge Barbara Eden/Jeannie fan I was disappointed with thequality of this movie.  The plot is predictable and the film is barelyover an hour long - which turned out to be a good thing.  If all you want to see is Barbara prancing around in a thousand outfits that bare her mid-section then buy this movie.  For the true fan, I recommend you buy her other movies.  Even the five minutes she's on screen in ""From the Terrace"" was better than this.  ""Ride the Wild Surf"" is one of my favorites.",941932800,8,494,4.326086956521739

1652606,4,B00005R26H,"Halfway through this movie I started to lose interest & assumed I knew how it would end. Did not suspect the real killer.
But I would swear the women that was killed in the opening is standing next to the the hero in the party seen as Barbra Eden is dancing around.
The music is not as cheesy as you might think, however it does tend to drift when it gets to close to a recognizeable lick.",1446508800,,389,4.064935064935065
1652607,3,B00005R26H,"Barbara Eden is sexy and beautiful as ever but the story line is simple, so the acting isn't very challenging.  Robert Vaughn seems like he's still portraying his role from ""The Man From UNCLE""... not very believable in the part of Eden's husband.  The picture isn't modified for wide screen viewing so it really takes you back to an era of days gone by.",1413849600,,354,4.515625

1652611,3,B00005R26H,"I saw this movie. It was not that great. But, the main and only reason I bought it is because of Barbara Eden (Jeannie, ""I Dream of Jeannie"").

1652613,5,B00005R26H,"THE WOMAN HUNTER opens w/ the murder of a woman, and the theft of her diamond jewelry. A man named Paul Carter (Stuart Whitman) seems to be responsible. Enter beautiful, zillionaire socialite, Dina Hunter (Barbara Eden). Dina has just returned home after a terrible auto accident. Her husband (Robert Vaughn) is an overly-driven, inattentive jerk. This sends the bored and neglected Dina into the arms of another man. Uh oh! The other man is none other than Paul! She has no idea that he's been following her for months, and insinuating himself into her life! One night, while looking for Paul, Dina stumbles upon his secret recordings and realizes that he's not what he appears to be. This leads to a car chase, and the explosive twist finale! This is Ms. Eden's movie. She is captivatingly gorgeous! She's also a great actress. Her dance scene is a show-stopper! Highly recommended for the Barbara Eden fanatic!...",1376265600,,916,4.916129032258064

7951580,2,B00005R26H,"Slow, boring, bad film quality; poor script and directing.  Barbara Eden was good in the part but the 2 ""attractive"" men were way too old for her.  They both looked like they were pushing a paunchy  50 while she was a gorgeous 30.  All the men were so rude to her-- why?  Is boorish, controlling behavior from men that are old enough to be your father supposed to be attractive?  She deserved better.",1486598400,,400,4.410958904109589
7951581,1,B00005R26H,"Truly stupid movie that basically spent 99% of the time on unrelated plots. The whole Bermuda/Larry Storch scenes were totally unnecessary. You think the ending might make up for it, but it is stupid as well. A VW Thing falls down a hill, rolling 10 times, and rests on its side. Suddenly when it's pushed down and rolls over ONCE it explodes. Huh? Bottom line: Everyone in this movie did it for a paid vacation.",1486598400,,412,4.506666666666667
