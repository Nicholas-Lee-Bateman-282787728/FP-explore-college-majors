Beautiful, graceful, powerful, exacting, encompassing, and centering - I love this Radiant Lotus Fan Dance and the instructor, Daisy Lee, who is calm, thorough, thoughtful, and pleasant.

I am incorporating the disciples of the lessons tought herein into my daily living.

Daisy Lee - thank you for sharing this form of life altering awareness.

I will add that Daisy's speech is clear and easy to understand.",1362441600,5,472,5.171052631578948
