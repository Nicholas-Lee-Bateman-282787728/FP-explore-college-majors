8194655,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"I put it in my Oppo and all it showed was a bunch of folders and files; no menu system at all for navigating, and I could not get it to work.",1293926400,3,141,3.4375
8194656,2,B000Q6GWOQ,I was expecting a music experience in 3D sound reality.  What I got was very poor electronic music that sounded very amateurish.  What a waste of money.  Don't buy this.,1224460800,6,169,4.566666666666666
8194657,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"This Blu-Ray disc was not recognized by my LG BH200 player.  This is the first and only time my player would not play a particular disc.  I don't know if my copy was defective or all discs produced by this manufacturer won't play on a BH200.  It's a shame, really, because I was looking forward to listening to Bach in true hi definition sound.  I returned it for credit.",1223856000,5,371,4.333333333333333
8194658,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"Wouldn't you know, the first time I purchase something without reading customer reviews I get burned!

I Purchased this title because of the DTS HD Master Audio track and because I assumed it was a surround sound mix of an orchestra playing Bach. Quite the contrary - this is no more than a synthesizer playing out of all my speakers. Now if it was really well done I'd probably be happy anyway but it's not. I'd have to agree with another poster that said it had a monotone sound. The whole thing's just weird!",1219449600,4,511,4.4361702127659575
8194659,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"This disc is nothing more than midi music recorded on multiple channels, or crap in surround to be blunt about it. If you want to know what this sounds like, just listen to a Casio keyboard playing any ol' public domain classical music. Rubbish of this kind is even available many places for free. All they did here was add the extra channels, but this adds absolutely nothing whatsover to the experience of listening to this and is of very poor quality anyway. Again, it just sounds like an electronic keyboard playing on your sound system (awful). There is nothing artistic or creative here at all. Of course that is the reason that you do not see any samples here, if there were no one would be spending any money on this. The same goes for this entire series.

Here is what really throws up the red flags though: After much research I have concluded that every single one of the positive reviews here are fake, written to convince you that this is a actually a good product worthy of your hard-earned money and time spent listening to. I have carefully investigated the histories of all of these ""5 star"" reviewers and commenters for this series, and I encourage you to do the same. What this is here is a known guerilla marketing tactic, perpetrated I strongly believe, by one or just a few persons. You can see this for yourself by simply clicking on all of the reviewer's (and commenter's) names and looking at their other reviews, comments and even lists. You will find that they are ALL overwhelmingly and consitantly for this series alone (There very few for others, BUT EVEN THOSE are cross-linked right back to promote these, so you are always directed to these discs!). In comparing them you will see the exact SAME type of language usage, idiosyncracies and mispellings throughout and across all of these, under all of the different aliases. This very same person also seems to lurk here and almost immediately responds to any honest reviews by attacking the reviewer and often posting a new fake review under a different fake alias in an attempt to bury the honest review, again with the very same language characteristics and consistent mispellings. It's likely that the same will happen to this review as well. It has happened to me on my reviews of other discs in this series (Uncommon Bach standard dvd and Uncommon Mozart) where I have been repeatedly attacked as this seller tries to discredit me. You can even find other message boards on other sites with the same exact types of comments, language, etc. If you are doubtful of what I am saying, go ahead and order it anyway and see for yourself. I'd bet you'll find yourself returning it while shaking your head in disbelief after first listen.

I hope that Amazon will take some action against these dishonest and sleazy marketing tactics. Amazon reviewers have steered me clear of other bad products and consumer rip-offs in the past while greatly aiding my many purchase decisions, and I feel happy to be able to give back to the community here.",1216512000,13,3021,4.69811320754717
8194660,4,B000Q6GWOQ,"This recording is kind of special, the Video consist of a photo of an exotic flower, shot at close range, which changes every 10 seconds to a new flower. The audio is the Uncommon Bach music but in this one (I have the DTS Music disc of Uncommon Bach and that is uniquely an organ piece) you have different kinds of musical instruments.

The audio is in DTS-HD HR. My Toshiba HD DVD cannot decode HR (High Resolution) at this time but I hope an update will enable HR, one day. But the DTS surround is quite nice.

This is a very relaxing recording. When the end is reached, it automatically loops from the beginning. Can be used as a good demo to receive friends for an HD event, such as a movie.",1186531200,2,696,4.225563909774436
8194661,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"Well seems people either love this disk or hate it.  If you are a classical guru and can dissect music like a Ginsu Chef, this disk is for you.  If you just love cool sounding classical music on kickass stereo equipment and your taste in music is ecclectic, you may be bored of the repetative (almost monotone) nature of the synth musak.  Personally, I hope I can just trade this disk in for 2 dollar credit at a cd recycling store.",1185408000,10,432,4.308641975308642
8194662,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"I erased my review as comments only seem to include assumptions of what my motivations and thoughts are on this. It is simple; The soundquality is nice to good, but it is not what I like. That means that I did not enjoy the content of the disc. Isn't that what a review is allowed to reflect?

The uncommon approach to the classical music of Johan Sebastian Bach deserves in my opinion (!!!) more than emotionless tones from synthesizers. As Bach created his music in 17th and 18th century Germany he was highly regarded and respected ,among many others, by W.A. Mozart and L. von Beethoven. Mozart apparantly said about his music: ""Listen, this is something we can learn from"".

Bach taught many student's in a variety of styles and always demanded that partitures would be written on seperate bars in order to see the melody. A boring melody was not tolerated by him.

To me the performance is flat and boring. With respect to the composer I  believe that the music produced does not do justice to his creations.",1184112000,13,1014,4.616666666666666
8194663,1,B000Q6GWOQ,"About the best thing I can say for this HD-DVD is that it shows the medium's potential for surround-sound music accompanied by beautiful images -- just barely.

The program starts with a particularly sappy rendition of BWV 208 (sometimes sung in English as ""Sheep May Safely Graze""). The rest of the collection isn't quite that bad, but shows little variation of tempo or dynamics, with none of the verve of, say, the Brandenburg Concertos as performed by Wendy Carlos. The ""instrument"" sounds are mostly flutes and tinkling harps and bells, and their sound, while pleasant at times, is close-in rather than spacious, which I don't feel makes the best use of the surround medium. Bass is all front-and-center with that awful middle-of-your-head quality you get from monaural sound through headphones. Why does it have to be like that in a program billed as ""music experience in a three-dimensional sound reality""?

The video portion is a series of close-up stills of flowers. Each one is beautiful by itself, but seeing one right after another through the entire program, with never a pullback to a broader view, gets boring. It's no aesthetic plus that the caption ""Uncommon Bach / Music experience...[etc.]"" persists throughout the program, as does the ""dts-HD"" logo in the upper right corner.

If you're visiting a friend who has an HD DVD player, you might want to bring a copy of The Last Samurai to offer just in case he should have Uncommon Bach playing.",1183334400,12,1461,4.930894308943089
