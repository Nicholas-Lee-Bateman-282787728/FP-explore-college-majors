3482093,1,B001B3LIRE,"I was amazed that this movie was rated G.  I am even more amazed that the description of the movie on the slip cover was so off the mark and misleading......almost deceptive on the part of the Weinstein Company, who made the film.  My 4-year old daughter was scared throughout this entire movie because the entire plot of the movie was about a pack of wolves trying to find reindeer to eat and plotting to located Santa's Fell so they could eat Santa and his flying reindeer.  I found the movie to be extremely dark and sinister.  This movie has no Christmas cheer or happiness in it at all until the end when the reindeer manage to stay free of the wolves.  It is totally inappropriate for this movie to be rated G, and it's even more inappropriate that the movie description read ""...stuffed with sweet songs and comical characters..."" and ""The Flight Before Christmas is a jolly journey that proves that belief in yourself is the greatest gift of all.""  There is nothing jolly or sweet about this movie!",1225584000,13,1006,4.561111111111111
3482094,5,B001B3LIRE,While this movies isn't your ordinary christmas classic it is a good movie. I have a three year old who loves it and has watched it every day since we got it. Some parts are scary like the wolves chaseing Niko and the wolves getting into Santa's area it all turns out fine and there is a happy ending. I do not reccomend this if your child is one that gets easily frightened at the wolves might scare them.,1225238400,9,406,4.151898734177215

3482127,4,B001B3LIRE,"Although it's hilarious, this is the most disturbing Christmas movie I've ever seen!  And, although the description on the back of the jewel case indicates that it is an ""animated holiday movie the entire family can enjoy,"" I wouldn't recommend letting your children or old-fashioned grandparents watch it!

It stars Niko, an illegitmate bastard born to a doe after a one-night stand with, according to her, the most handsome of Santa Claus' reindeer, when he took her for a ride with Santa's sleigh.  She didn't even know or remember the reindeer's name, but became pregnant with Niko as a result of her indiscretion.

So Niko wants to learn to fly, and fly with Santa's Flying Forces, a.k.a. the reindeer who pull Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve.

An old squirrel named Julius, with the voice of Norm MacDonald, serves as Niko's adoptive father.  There is also a big buck who serves as the leader of Niko's herd and prohibits anyone from leaving Home Valley.

Which is, of course, exactly what Niko does.

Before Julius can stop him, Niko ends up drinking with Santa's cowardly Flying Forces at a bar, where they all deny being his father, or remembering his mother, since they have sex with so many does!

Since reindeer apparently talk but don't have access to D.N.A. tests in this film, they have Niko jump off a cliff to prove he is the offspring of one of them.  If he can fly, he must be one of their offspring.  SPOILER ALERT!  He can't fly, but survives the fall to fly another day, helping to save the cowardly reindeer from the wolves, after which one of the reindeer acknowledges that Niko is, evidently, his son.

As usual, the wolves continue to go hungry, because hunting and killing is so evil!  Democratically liberal agenda, anyone?

The one effeminate wolf who falls for a pink, female poodle gets to eat Santa's scraps like a dog.

Meanwhile, Niko decides not to fly with Santa's Flying Forces, but live happily ever after with his mother and Julius.  His biological father stops by, creating an awkward moment with his baby's mama, and agrees to visit Niko on occasion.

And a young doe falls for Niko, so, presumably, he can sire innumerable illegitimate bastards, just like his father, for the rest of his life.

I'm still giving this fim four stars because it made me laugh so hard with its inappropriateness!  It reminds me of Rosario Dawson's line in Clerks II, about the donkey show being the most disgusting thing she'd ever seen, yet being unable to look away!",1468368000,2,2490,4.719907407407407

3482153,5,B001B3LIRE,"The animation in this movie is wonderful, and while I thought it a little strange that Niko's father never stayed, the rest of the movie was amazing and even funny in places. I think if I'd have written the movie I'd have had Niko's father die or something instead of the one night stand type of thing, it would have been morally better. After all these movies are for kids and should be morally sound, just my opinion, but it is very true that children learn what they live.",1424476800,2,475,4.348314606741573

3482171,1,B001B3LIRE,"This is a terrible terrible movie for kids with a horrible message.  A quick plot summary:

A reindeer kid never knew his dad, but always wanted to meet him. His Dad turned out to be Prancer, one of Santas reindeer. One night Prancer flew into the valley where the kids mom lived, slept with her, and then flew away and never returned. So the little reindeer kid goes on a dangerous journey to the North Pole to find his dad. His friends on the journey are a squirrel and a chipmunk. They keep warning him, not to get his hopes up, and that his dad might not be a hero or a nice guy when he finally meets him. When they finally get to the north pole, Prancer denies paternity and makes the kid prove that he is his son by trying to flythere is a whole song about the DNA will tell which is pretty offensive.

The kid then fails to fly and Prancer says, I knew you weren't my son. In the end some wolves attack and the kid saves the day by flying. Prancer then reluctantly admits he is the kids dad. So the kid is now flying around with Prancer and he says Lets fly back and see mom. Prancer refuses and the kid leaves the deadbeat reindeer dad at the north pole and goes back to live with his mom. At the end the kid says something like, I spent my whole life looking for my dad, but I didn't need him, all I need is right here with you mom.

Just terrible, a horrible message especially for a Christmas movie.  Also in one part of the movie the Reindeer crash the sleigh, Santa flies out and hits a tree.  He then bursts into flames and burns up!  It turns out that it was just a ""crash test dummy"" santa, and not the real santa, but it wasn't made very clear and I had a  hard time explaining that one to my kids.",1417996800,3,1715,4.053254437869822

I watched this with my 3 yr old and now he thinks Wolves are going to eat Santa and him on christmas.  Should not be rated G!

3482261,5,B001B3LIRE,"I first saw this as a 45 minute special on CBS a few weeks ago.  It looked pretty good from the previews, so I had to check it out.  While I thought the story was pretty good, I thought it left a lot of loose ends and unfinished plot.  So imagine my surprise when I did a web search on it, and found out this was actually an 80 minute movie made in Finland!  So I immediately sent for the DVD, which features the full length movie, and I have to say it was much better than the 45 minute ""condensed for TV"" version.  All of my questions were answered and all of the loose ends were tied up.  I honestly don't know what CBS was thinking, making a 45 minute special out of an 80 minute movie (essentially, cutting out half of the movie!)  All of Niko's quest to find his father, and all of the dangers he encounters along the way, make the story so much more epic!  Also, one reviewer pointed out that in the TV special version, the poodle character, Essie, simply vanishes once her part is complete - well, in the full length movie, you do get to find out what happens to her (nothing bad, by the way).  I thought it was a very enjoyable story, and it's become my favorite Christmas movie this year.  Santa's Flying Forces are a riot, as well!  And I really liked the main message of the story, that if you believe in yourself, you really can accomplish your dreams.  Another good message was that your heroes often just turn out to be ordinary people like you and me, so don't put them up on a pedastal.  I know a lot of reviewers don't like the ""one night stand"" aspect of the story, but it's not really dwelt upon to any extent.  Overall, I think this is a really great and exciting Christmas story, which I am sure I'll be watching every Christmas from now on.

The sequel movie, ""Little Brother, Big Trouble"" is also available on DVD, but I was only able to find it through Wal*mart.  Amazon does have it as a download, though.  It's pretty good, but not quite as good as the first movie, and all the voice actors are different.",1356652800,4,2032,4.22279792746114

3482286,1,B001B3LIRE,The values taught in this movie are very disappointing and very disturbing for a Christmas story.  I hope to never find it airing on network television again.

3482288,5,B001B3LIRE,"I read the reviews for this movie after placing it in the DVD player for my 3 year old.  I was a little worried, but decided to allow him to watch.  After watching the movie myself, the two areas where parents were the most concerned are certainly in the movie. However, they aren't as awful as made out to be. Niko, the young reindeer, never does know his father.  But, he doesn't go without the love and affection of a two parents.  Since many families have the situation where another adult steps in to fill the shoes of a missing parent, this message wasn't upsetting to me in the least.  While I don't obviously approve of the 'one night stand' aspect, it wasn't handled poorly.

The other area that parents of young children seem to have an issue with is the wolves and their plot to eat santa, his reindeer and all the children of the world.  Well, I've read my son the TRUE versions of fairytales since before he could talk.  The wolf eats Henny Penny and all the birds who follow on her silly quest.  The wolf eats Red-Riding Hood and her grandma.  The wolf eats the three pigs... So wolves plotting to eat something and being bad is nothing new to my child. He wasn't at all bothered.

There isn't violence or anything overly sexual about this movie that I personally noticed.  We took my son to see Rise of the Guardians (where the Boogieman plots to hurt and scare young children in their sleep) and my son did fine with that too.  If your children had no issues with that movie, this one won't be a problem.

I will say this is first movie my son has sat down and watched from beginning to end, he really did love it.",1354752000,3,1630,4.319078947368421

3482291,5,B001B3LIRE,"It was a very touching animation. At first I disliked the weak main character, but then I got used to him. The characters and story could be referred to many of us. Like the father deer that can be referred to irresponsible fathers, step father that adopted another being as his son,etc. While I didn't love the movie I did have one favorite character and the story was interesting. The story didn't get me bored and while there are many bad reviews, I do believe it deserves a better rating. Because they are simply silly. But I won't go into depth about anything but the movie. Maybe most of the plot could be too childish and full of fantasy, but those who dream, achieve wondrous things. It was silly from me to hesitate to watch it.

- The main character is a result of a one night stand. Santa's reindeer are very open to the fact that one night stands are a common occurrence for them during their Christmas Eve travels.
- Santa's reindeer are egotistical and haughty.  They are shown drinking/socializing in a bar setting at the North Pole.
- One of the protagonists, a weasel, sings in the bar in a very sexy voice with promiscuous moves.  Kid appropriate? NO!
- The antagonist is a scary wolf (which terrified my 4 year old) who plots to NOT ONLY EAT SANTA AND HIS REINDEER, but to then EAT CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD!!!
- If that's not enough, the writing and dialog is just plain bad.
Who in their right mind thought this made a good Christmas story??????????????????????????????",1325462400,4,958,4.623529411764705

3482295,1,B001B3LIRE,"The opening scenes of this 2008 film left me feeling awkward watching with a 6 year old. The hero teen deer has been told his father is a member of Santa's reindeer. His mom had met the buck while he was repairing in the sleigh and he took her for a ride on the sleigh and the fawn was born the next spring and the buck was never heard from again. so not even a one night stand. Just a ride in the sleigh and she's having a baby and the father claims NO responsibility. Later a lead character is introduced, a fox that wants to be a singer, so she runs away from home and hangs out in a reindeer bar singing for Santa's reindeer while they consume massive amounts of ""barley juice"" after training. When the fawn confronts the reindeer to find out who his father might be, he asks, ""have any of you taken a doe out for a sleigh ride on Christmas eve?"" To which they ALL respond ""hahaha, of coarse we all have, it's what we do."" None of the reindeer own up that they might be the kids father. Another one of the main characters is a pink female shaved poodle. Her butt is not a dogs butt, but the butt of a typical bikini model with no bikini and a tail. How we doing on this concept of a kids movie? Yes, the little 6 year old was laughing quite a bit. The final moral of the story? It doesn't matter who your mom had sex with to give you life and ran off to never be seen again, what matters is who happens to be nearest and most kind to you. I'll take the 1960's moral integrity of the original Rankin Bass animations over this new moral character any day.",1324857600,3,1557,4.058441558441558
3482296,1,B001B3LIRE,"So bad it's hard to know where to begin...

How about the beginning? The movie's premise is that one of Santa's reindeer (aka Santa's Flying Forces) has a one night stand with a doe, resulting in their child Niko. The doe didn't bother to get the name of the reindeer she slept with (guess she was a Flying Force groupie) and it goes downhill from there.

The movie also includes a pack of wolves with plans to eat Santa, Santa's reindeer, and children of the world, which would probably be pretty scary for younger kids.

There's also a heartwarming scene (please note the sarcasm) of Santa's reindeer in a bar (yep, I said a bar) where none of them remember who slept with Niko's mother. ""Sorry kid, this is the world famous Flying Forces you're dealing with. We're gonna need more details.""

And there's a subplot with a pink poodle that might have belonged in another movie altogether...

Watched this with our then 9 and 11 year-old sons and the only fun we had was making fun of how bad the movie was.  Targeting a movie towards children about one night stands that result in kids, Santa's reindeer in bars, and a scary wolf pack out to eat Santa is just sort of creepy. If I could give it less than one star, I would.

You're better off wathcing National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Christmas Vacation is definitely going to be a little inappropriate for some kids, but kids weren't the target audience, so you know that going in... and better yet it's actually entertaining.",1324252800,3,1484,4.598484848484849

The wolfes could be a little scary for children and the storyline a little too modern for some adults but all in all I think you will enjoy it.

I found the plot compelling, the character's interesting, and the animation beautiful. I have no problem with children viewing this special; I agree the children should be more mature than when they first veiw Frosty and Rudolph. I am a man in my thirties and, admittedly, Flight before Christmas is not like the Rankin*Bass Christmas specials of my youth.

I strongly disagree with the detractors of Flight before Christmas.  I wish to remind them that many of the Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse cartoons the we watched as children were originally intended for a theater audience that included adults! I do not understand why so many seem to confuse 'made for children' with 'made by children'. I humbly suggest that the displeased reviewers should instead wacth Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer: the Movie (1998) with voices from John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg and Richard Simmons; I'm sure they will adore this cartoon for the exact reasons that I do not.",1261785600,3,1045,4.965714285714285

I'm just saying if you found Nemo to be acceptable for your children, then you'd have no problem with this movie (imo).  My 2 1/2 year old girl loves ""The Flight Before Christmas"".  She asks for it almost every day.  I won't get into story lines or plot elements.  I simply say the movie is a lot of fun.  Much more action filled than a typical Christmas movie.  And something different than your typical ""Santa and his flying reindeer"" type of movie.  Our whole family enjoyed it.",1261353600,2,802,4.549295774647887
3482316,2,B001B3LIRE,"While I honestly feel for single-parent households whose children have never met one of the parents, taking traditional holiday characters and turning them into ""deadbeat dads"" is not the best plot idea for a Christmas special.  As you read in other reviews, the basic premise is that the main character's mother (who cannot fly) by chance ran into Santa's flying reindeer after Santa's sleigh broke down. One of the flying reindeer fixed the sleigh, had a ""magical time"" with the mother, and quickly flew away. Months later, the main character Niko was born. When asked why the flying reindeer didn't come back to visit, the mother said that he ""didn't know that (Niko) would be born months later, so why would he visit"" and that ""no one knows where Christmastown where the flying reindeer stay actually is"".

Thus starts a long trek for Niko to find his father and understand why he has dreams of flying. Along the way, he meets a flirtatious female weasel who just happens to know where Christmastown is located.  When Niko finally finds the flying reindeer in a bar, the weasel starts a sultry song-and-dance number about giving the flying team a ""big surprise,"" and at the end of the song literally sings ""one of you share the same DNA"" and points towards Niko, which of course spooks the flying team. When Niko gives his mother's name and asks if any of the team remembers her, he is basically told that the entire flying reindeer team have ""magical times"" with the non-flying reindeer very often, and Niko is asked to perform a paternity test of showing he can fly to prove that he is actually one of their sons. Basically, to make a long story short, Niko ""saves the day"" and one of the reindeer steps forward very grudgingly and tells Niko that he can call him dad.  Merry Christmas! Niko tries to get his father to return to the non-flying pack, the father says that he's part of a ""flying team"" and isn't willing to go back, and Niko tells a flying squirrel who had looked out for him since day one that he is more of a dad to him than his real dad would ever be. Then, the credits roll.

While the forced lessons of ""it's ok to have a deadbeat dad"" and ""step fathers can be real fathers even if they look different"" could be pertinent to certain families, it can also send the wrong message to children that it is ok to take advantage of others and leave without taking responsibility for your actions.  What's worse is that when you watch the movie the second time knowing which one of Santa's reindeer is the actual father, you see a new perspective from the bar scene forward of the father knowingly trying to deny Niko, even going so far as denying meeting Niko's mother in the bar, letting Niko throw himself into a bottomless cliff during the ""can you fly"" paternity test, and basically saying ""well you can't fly, guess no one here is your father"" after Niko fails the test.

In all honesty, not one part of this film gave me a warm holiday spirit, and I seriously would warn parents about the movie's message before letting their children see it.  Do not be tricked by the cutesy cover, characters, and descriptions... this children's flick feels like it was written and directed by Maury Povich.",1260835200,18,3216,4.580869565217391

He has several animal friends that help him search for his roots (his father is Prancer, one of Santa's Sleigh Crew).  It is also a story of belief in yourself and trying new things.  It was produced in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the U.S.

Niko, has been told that his father could fly.  He goes out in search of his father, along with Julius the Flying Squirrel (Norm MacDonald) and Wilma, a cute small white rodent-like animal (Emma Roberts).  Niko suffers from severe dizziness and is also young and vulnerable as the story unfolds.  He has many challenges in finding his father including a pack of bad wolfs who want to eat Santa, all his reindeer and the boys and girls presents are delivered to.

Folks, this movie is centered on a young reindeer whos hotshot flyboy father knocked up his mother during a one night stand, then left never to be seen again.  It is a dark story about wolves (quite scary for a three year old by the way) who conspire to eat Santa and all the reindeer so the head wolf can travel to all the homes of the ""delicious boys and girls"" on Christmas night.  The positive message of a reindeer who learns to fly because he believes in himself is far outshadowed by the dark, almost disturbing storyline and the awful family values it portrays.

3482337,4,B001B3LIRE,"When this popped up on CBS TV the other night, I started watching it, and the first thing I thought was ""This is not an American-made film.""  For one thing, it's fairly densely plotted and has a much more complex and dark storyline than a U.S. cartoon would have.  Sure enough, although CBS zipped through the ending credits almost too quickly to read them, I saw that it was made in Finland.  That explains it!  The night I watched, it followed on the heels of the awful 1996 ""The Return of Frosty"" cartoon, which made the Finnish production seem that much more intelligent.

As a grown-up viewer, I thoroughly enjoyed the story -- a young reindeer searching for his father, whom he believes to be one of Santa's heroic flying squadron.  The youngster is helped along his way by a fatherly, protective flying squirrel and a female ermine/weasel (?) who warbles pop tunes like an American Idol contestant.  There's also a pink French poodle who appears suddenly and disappears mysteriously once her plotline is over (what becomes of her??).  Yes, there are implications of reindeer one-night stands (how very Scandinavian of them!), and Niko's real dad turns out to have, shall we say, commitment issues (many kids will relate, I'm afraid).  And there are some scary wolf villains -- but really, no scarier than the hyenas in ""The Lion King,"" which this production seems to channel (one could say ""copy"" if one were ungenerous) more often than not. The digital character animation looks a bit clunky, with giant grinning amorphous faces that too often really look computerized -- but the backgrounds and landscapes are quite lovely.  There are shots of the Scandinavian forest with the aurora borealis overhead that are very memorable. The musical score recalls Howard Shore's ""Lord of the Rings"" and almost seems a bit too grand for the room.  But this is an hour-long cartoon that is really trying to be quite epic in its story and scope, and I think it's the first Finnish production (that I can recall, anyway) to make it to the U.S. TV market in such a big way (major network broadcast).

As for the scare factor of the big bad wolves -- really, can ANYTHING be scarier than the classic 1939 ""Wizard of Oz""?? ""Oz"" gave me tornado and flying-monkey nightmares for years as a kid, but I loved it and watched it whenever it was on.  I think a few good TV scares never hurt any child!  Classic Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales are chock-full of scary and often quite violent situations; even the best Disney films (like ""Lion King"") are full of scares and sadness.  I give the Finns points for offering a little darkness and scare factor, and not serving up sugary holiday syrup like ""Frosty Returns"" (or even the original 1960s ""Frosty the Snowman,"" which also preceded ""Flight Before Christmas"" the other night -- yup, it may be a beloved classic, but wow, it's so sweet it makes your teeth hurt!).

So, yes, I recommend ""The Flight Before Christmas"" -- a Finnish production that is a quite worthy and surprisingly intelligent entry into the annual holiday animation derby.",1229212800,27,3098,4.773408239700374
