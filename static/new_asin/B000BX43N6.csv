8093802,5,B000BX43N6,"The Rumor Mill is a wonderful movie ! It was originally made for television in 1985 under the title Malice In Wonderland . It stars Elizabeth Taylor as gossip queen Louella Parsons. And Jane Alexander as actress and gossip queen Hedda Hopper. These two bitches have to be heard to be believed ! They were competitors and hated each other.  Elizabeth reportedly loathed Louella in real life and certainly nailed her character and voice perfectly ! The way she pronounces Hollywood on her radio show is screamingly funny ! Fans of  Elizabeth Taylor and you KNOW who you are, will love this film ! It is a  film that is very entertaining, and captures the Hollywood of the studio system in the 1930's and 1940's. Fans of Elizabeth Taylor will like this the most.",1513555200,,759,4.649253731343284
8093803,5,B000BX43N6,"This movie, based on the lives and relationship between Luella Parsons and Heda Hoper is excellent!  Both Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Alexander both give great performances of the famous Hollywood reporters of the 1930's and beyond!!",1459123200,,231,5.416666666666667
8093804,5,B000BX43N6,"I have to warn you the story is boring,just two old ladies who are so competitive that they will go to almost any length for power in the sick world of Hollywood. The movie is a treat if you are fans of Elizabeth and Jane.",1398470400,,222,3.9555555555555557
8093805,5,B000BX43N6,"I used to have this movie on VHS video tape but I unfortunately lost it in a house fire eight years ago.  I collect good movies and 'The Rumor Mill' is, in my opinion a very good movie.  I found it hilarious to see how these gossip columnists could put fear into a lot of the big movie stars and the feud between these two columnists is a riot !  .... and very entertaining !  I've tried several times to order this movie from Amazon,  but keep being told you cannot deliver to my address.  Hopefully it will,  one day,  be released on DVD and maybe I might be able to order it from Amazon.",1384387200,,590,4.069565217391304
8093806,5,B000BX43N6,"those two bitches killing themselves is a highlight comedy! Full of  give and take dialogues this movie is af field for the two stars, specially Taylor, who in her days, knew very well the two snakes!",1379462400,,200,4.555555555555555
8093807,5,B000BX43N6,"this isn't a long involved movie, it is quick and to the point...about the gossip queens of Hollywood that every one hated, Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper played by Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Alexander. it is fun and bitchy. full of name dropping people and 30s, 40s and even 50s glamourous scenery. i can't place the time just right but it appears to be a real happening in history when these two ladies met for lunch and all of Hollywood held its breath. Elizabeth Taylor is just wonderful in it and i hear she loathed Parsons in real life. the dvd doesn't seem to be available or is it just affordable. a good movie night movie.",1361577600,,632,4.456896551724138
8093808,5,B000BX43N6,"These two vemom filled women, could wreck a marrige or carrer with one wave of a pen!

This is a  great account of the havoc legendary gossip colomnists Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper created in the years between 1928 thru the war years. The tension and terror these women created just by being in the same room (though never together), they were bitter rivals, caused anyone near to hold their breath!

This is a deliciously wicked and fun account of Hollywoods industry told form these two womens damaging and often humerous dealings.",1180742400,,538,4.826086956521739
