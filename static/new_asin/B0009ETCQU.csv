8059632,3,B0009ETCQU,I got this set for my nephew in India and my wife who helps with college admissions also viewed this one. The video is very lengthy and slow--there are some good points but it is frustrating when you have to listen to Carl Weber (spelling?) talking for 2 hours and make some 15 useful points that can be discussed in 30 minutes tops--you know the kids are not going to sit and watch this. Some advice is outdated including the common app topics. Some references are to Michelle Hernandez--that's not an authentic source from the college admissions perspective.,1371427200,,560,4.724489795918367
