2804207,1,B000OYCNZM,Warning do not buy! This must be a joke. Why say the first season when it clearly wrong I cant understand how you are still selling this garbage. It dose not say 1-4 on the flyer...........,1306368000,2,189,4.277777777777778
2804208,1,B000OYCNZM,"This is ridiculous I thought I was paying for the COMPLETE first season instead I got just disc one. How can you sell a product like this, it almost makes me think I should never buy from Amazon.com again. It's sneaky and dishonest!! When it says complete first season I would think it would be all 14 episodes not just 1 disc. False advertising is completely wrong!! When you add this product to your cart you see the picture with all 3 disc and the words The Complete First Season. I really want my money back. I used the search to find the complete season and I see the product and preview details automatically adding it to my cart. The product gets here I open it and see it's only one disc I feel ripped off and you can't return an open product to get your full moneys worth back or get the correct product advertised, I just want the complete first season. I thought online shopping was supposed to make things simple and less frustrating but it just made it more of a pain. DO NOT buy this product unless you want to be taken advantage of. It's sneaky and wrong, you pay full price for less than half the product!!",1306108800,9,1122,4.297169811320755
2804209,1,B000OYCNZM,Nobody sells stuff in this manner.  It should be criminal but I guess it comes under buyer beware.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  Get the FULL COMPLETE SEASON 1 for about the same price.  This is ridiculous.,1298419200,,195,4.333333333333333

2804212,1,B000OYCNZM,"Do not buy this - tho it says The COMPLETE First Season, it is not.

It is only one disk with only the Pilot and 4 episodes of the First Season. AND to top that off, episode 4 is a 2-part episode, and this disk only has part one, not the 2nd part.

This disk is a rip-off, if not downright false advertising - because this package DOES NOT CONTAIN the COMPLETE first season, only 4 of the 14 episodes.

If they are not going to explain this in detail, it should be illegal to sell this as a COMPLETE First Season.

Do Not Buy This rip-off and lie, from any one.",1261612800,,561,3.982142857142857
2804213,5,B000OYCNZM,"This series is a must have for any Wonder Woman collector. What can I say? If you love Wonder Woman, YOU MUST HAVE THE COMPLETE SET!! There... it is ordained! Go Buy The Complete Set!  }:o)",1256688000,,189,4.25
2804214,1,B000OYCNZM,One disc?  $12.99 - How silly.  What a surprise when I opened the package and realized I'd paid this much money for 1 disk.  Who sells things this way?,1199491200,9,151,4.137931034482759
2804215,5,B000OYCNZM,"The first season is only 14 episodes on 2 double sided and 1 single sided disc.  Who in their right brain is only gonna buy 1 disc of such a small season?  This should be offered as a ""giveaway"" to someone whose disc 1 is defective NOT ""sold""",1189296000,11,242,4.020833333333333
8187462,4,B000OYCNZM,As a child I always liked Wonder woman. I let my five year old granddaughter watch the movie and she kept referring to her as super woman. I think she still is.,1445126400,,160,4.03125
8187463,5,B000OYCNZM,Great product...,1419033600,,16,7.5
8187464,5,B000OYCNZM,"Oh wow, was I ever glad to see this available.  The first disc of my season one collection was damaged during a recent move and would no longer play on my DVD player.  I stumbled across this Amazon offering and immediately ordered it to replace my damaged disc.  Now my season one set is again complete.",1409184000,,303,4.375
8187465,1,B000OYCNZM,I wish that I had read these reviews first. I would stay away from this provider.  This can't be the only rip off item they are selling.  Run away!,1382400000,,147,4.0344827586206895

8187468,5,B000OYCNZM,Wonderful Linda Carter as WonderWoman. This starts out with the epic tale of how WonderWoman left Paradise Isle to join America and her allies in the fight against the evil Axis powers of WWII. It is a nice additiona to your collection if you just want a taste of WonderWoman but not a full bite. If you really enjoy the show I recommend purchasing it in the complete season packages.,1344470400,,384,4.5
8187469,1,B000OYCNZM,"This is only 1 Disc from Season One.  I also fell victim to this - thinking I was ordering the complete first season (which IS available on Amazon here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001ZMWYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman: The Complete First Season</a>).  I contacted customer service (via LIVE CHAT) and they were nice enough to arranged for a return and gave me free shipping on the correct item (since my original order containing other items was over $30).  I wish they would just remove this listing once and for all - or at least change the picture and take the word ""Complete"" out of the title.  This is VERY misleading!  If I could appeal to management regarding this I would. BE CAREFUL!",1334620800,2,795,5.760683760683761
8187470,5,B000OYCNZM,"My preteen daughters have loved these videos.  We now own 3 seasons DVD sets.  Even in this day and age of great special effects, the plot line with a woman as the hero still appeals to young girls.  Good, clean family entertainment.",1331596800,,233,4.5
8187471,1,B000OYCNZM,"This is not the original pilot film which was titled: The New Original Wonder Woman in 1975.  The version here is the re-edited 1976 cut, using footage from the 1975 film edited campy with light humour.  While this is fine as a film it is not the way it was presented.  Notable differences shown here in the DVD is the opening title credits that do not show the full title of the film in favour of the regular ABC TV series.  certain camera angles and performance delivery differs as well.  The major animated difference is that Wonder Woman deflected bullets in the true pilot film which was replaced with the lasso twirl.

As for the DVD - it would be better to get the entire frist season collection rather than this single disc. I would have enjoyed this single disc if it were to have the true pilot of 1975 which has NEVER been released on DVD.",1322438400,3,850,4.382165605095541
