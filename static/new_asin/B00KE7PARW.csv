8658054,4,B00KE7PARW,"The best volume of the series because it featured the Rough Riders -Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton with their first 6 films! Hopefully, volume 10 can pick up where volume 8 left cause volume 9 surely didn't with its remaining 3 features",1489363200,,246,4.613636363636363
8658055,4,B00KE7PARW,"A great addition with 9 of the Buck Jones, Tim McCoy ""Rough Riders"" Series as a bonus in like new restored condition. The Johnny Mack Brown films are great too. Worth the money.",1481068800,,177,4.393939393939394
8658056,5,B00KE7PARW,"Great collection!  Love the sharp, crisp images!  Wonderful action western stories!",1427846400,,83,6.454545454545454
8658057,5,B00KE7PARW,"The great thing about this collection is that you eventually can see The Rough Riders in great print. Always reliable VCI studio has a couple of their films out in nice prints but other studios have released Rough Rider films though the prints are junk. The Rough Riders ( Tim Mccoy, Buck Jones and Raymond Hatton ) is a powerfull and convincing trigger trio. Probably the best,( but oh, we must not forget The Three mesqueteers and of course not the Hopalong Cassidy trios). On this collection are also fine Johnny Mack Brown films.",1426723200,2,533,4.680851063829787
8658058,5,B00KE7PARW,"This was an excellent ""B"" grade western DVD.  Two great stars in Buck Jones and Johnny Mack Brown.  This was a good move in showing us Raymond Hatton as Sandy Hopkins.  This was a fun series to watch so I recommend to all you old western collectors to add this Monogram Produced series to your collection.",1424304000,2,305,4.410714285714286
8658059,5,B00KE7PARW,quality of the films is great considering the films are over 70yrs old.  Great to see Johnny & Ray back together again.,1422403200,,119,4.409090909090909
8658060,5,B00KE7PARW,"Wish they would do more of the old ""B"" westerns ... It's fun to revisit your youth",1414195200,2,82,3.8823529411764706
8658061,5,B00KE7PARW,6 EXCELLEMNT JOHNNY MACK BROWN FILMS FROM THE 40'S AND 6 ROUGH RIDER FILMS THAT ARE SUCH FUN. THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT WITH JUST A LITTLE SOUND PROBLEM TOWARD THE END OF ONE OF THE ROUGH RIDER FILMS BUT OVERALL MY FAVORITE OF ALL THE MONOGRAM COLLECTIONS.,1413072000,5,255,4.446808510638298
8658062,5,B00KE7PARW,"And it's about time that we've finally gotten these classic B-Westerns in decent looking condition. Heaven knows how many dollars I've wasted over the years on poor vhs and dvd copies, straining my eyes through dark, murky images, hoping for what seemed impossible. And now that impossibility has actually happened with this very impressive set.......So, can we now hope that Warner Archives has Monogram's Range Busters waiting in the wings for a quality release as well?",1406246400,13,472,5.223684210526316
