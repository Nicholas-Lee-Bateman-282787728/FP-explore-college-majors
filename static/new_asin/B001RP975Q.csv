Don't waste your time and hard earned money for something that will be no where near as satisfing as Donnie Darko (the actual movie)",1240963200,3,292,3.8833333333333333
3777321,1,B001RP975Q,"Even if the original cast and crew attempted to provide a sequel it would have been hard enough to work, however this was simply a very bad,bad,bad idea! The only thing I can relate this to is Halloween III which had no business in the franchise as this shouldn't have either! I'ts like the backstreet boys trying to cover the Beatles! For ethical reasons the producers and anyone else involved should pull this movie and refund the money to to those unfortunate enough to buy it like the tainted peanut butter! And to make things even more ironic this sad waste of money has the terrible actress from saved by the bell and showgirls.....I can't go on anymore, my blood pressure is going through the roof!",1239321600,16,705,4.603174603174603

3777383,2,B001RP975Q,I loved Donnie Darko and I thought this was a legitimate sequel. Its really not. It's not directed by Richard Kelley but mimics his style from the original. Some parts of the story were interesting but overall I felt this was a poor attempt to just cash in on the original and I was disappointed.,1495152000,,296,4.4

3777388,2,B001RP975Q,"This movie bothers me on a deep fundamental level as a fan of Donnie Darko. It sort of added irrelevant content involving the meteor, and while we understand that her brother escaping his first death jumpstarted the tangent universe in the first movie by a vision from the future this movie is fanfiction and is not in line with the original premise. Sam goes with her weird friend to some desert weird place and saves Roberta Sparrows son (convenient) from an asteroid from the tangent asteroid so Nathan Scott from One Tree Hill becomes Donnie. We see it from the manipulated deads perspective which would also conviently be Donnies sister Sam. There are some missing kids which are weird and also irrelevant and I think were written in as shock factor which never really gets explained but they're more manipulated dead. Within this universe Sam dies a couple times. Which is silly. Suddenly friends and others involved are big participants in the tangent universe. The Bunny Mask was also added in there for no real reason other than manipulated dead Samantha said ""Donnie likes to draw.""  This movie is not based on the complicated theories that challenged audiences in the first movie. What it does have is Ed Westwick being super hot and playing a hick Chuck Bass. Jasper from Twilight (Jackson Rathbone) trying be like ALIENS and not having very clear motives, Alaric from Vampire Diaries, and Nathan from One Tree Hill. It's a fandom party meeting in a terrible awful misinterpretion of the original movie, but I'm giving it two stars because Ed Westwick looks gorgeous. Superficial stars. This is not a deep movie. It's woo woo. It's not funny. The soundtrack is awful. They completely cannibalized and misunderstood their source material and the writing makes me sad to call myself one, because wtf? What is this? Let's pretend it never happened. Like most fans of Interview With The Vampire do not acknowledge Queen Of The Damned adaptation. What were the people writing and making this movie thinking?

If there is ever a real sequel that could live up to the original let me know.",1490486400,7,2094,4.862745098039215
3777389,1,B001RP975Q,"If you're a huge fan of Donnie Darko, don't watch this film. One of the amazing things about the first film was the writing. There are lines that I still think about all the time, ""You are a product of fear."" ""Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?"" etc...  S. Darko has horrible writing. Nothing special what so ever. The acting is dismal, and the cast is unimpressive. I would suggest only renting this, because you'll never watch  it again.",1488326400,3,446,4.493827160493828

I loved so many things starting with the fact that it is the perfect follow up, second edition, to Donnie Darko with his younger sister Samantha Darko following in Donnies footsteps. They even used the same actress who has grown up to be a gorgeous young woman with the same ailments as her brother. I don't want to give away anything about the storyline, but this is definitely a movie not to miss.

3777450,5,B001RP975Q,"I don't understand why people don't like this sequel I personally thought that this movie was awesome.  Obviously it was quite a bit different from the first movie so I guess that's why people didn't like it as much.  This was also done by another director which is a turn off to most people for some reason.  It looked like the director took a different approach and focused on more of the artistic aspects of the universe.  I also saw what the director was trying to do with the time loops which was pretty cool once you understand it all.  I thought that the acting was pretty good considering that these weren't well known actors.  I only saw one really known actor and that was the guy running the motel.  Again I loved this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.  If you're expecting to see S Darko become a rebel at school then you should probably skip this one.  I'm guessing that's why people liked the other movie so much and not this one.  Donnie Darko was pretty much an  intelligent guy (He was a receiver hence he had the ability to see through illusions and BS)  and was sticking it to the man throughout the entire movie.  Again don't expect the exact same movie as Donnie Darko, because this one is completely different.  In this movie there are multiple receivers.  There were some other parts that were kind of questionable but I was enjoying the movie so much that I seemed to not really care.  Again this is more of an artsy pre apocalyptic movie.  The movie has a lot of depressing overtones BTW which is probably why many people didn't like it.  You've been warned.",1428883200,2,1597,4.467128027681661

If you only liked DD or hated DD then you will projectile vomit all across your TV screen while watching this abortion of a movie.  The writer and director DESTROYED the entire DD concept with this thing. They left GAPING plot holes - completely unexplainable pieces of BS - throughout the movie.  The acting is terrible.  The CGI barely passable.

Do yourself a favour: go online and read the storyline line complete with spoilers. You will be satisfied with that. Save your $.

If you are a DD cult film fan: It is nice to be able to return to the world and imagine it all being a better story than you are watching.  Plus Sam Darko is a real cutey.",1411171200,8,791,4.346938775510204

3777461,2,B001RP975Q,Interesting film but mostly a more transparent take on the original. Some wooden performances at times but also some convincing moments.

3777466,2,B001RP975Q,"Loved Donnie Darko. This movie attempts to continue the story with his sister. It just never has a plot that I cared about. All the elements of the first movie are there, but S. Darko just is never compelling. I was not interested at all while watching this movie. I spent the whole time imagining a better movie and what the plot would be like...",1391990400,,347,4.3538461538461535
3777467,1,B001RP975Q,"From the opening moments of the film where some POS 70's leadsled breaks down and they say it doesn't look so good.. well, that is the foreshadowing of what is the rest of the film.  Instead of the brilliantly dark original film we have here a brazenly awful, wretched series of filler scenes.  If an actual movie editor got ahold of S Darko the movie would possibly be a minute in length.  The acting is supremely terrible, the cinematography becomes stupid, you begin to notice the actors from the original film wanted nothing to do with S Darko.

It is difficult to convey with actual words just how awful this movie really is.  Imagine everything that could possibly go wrong with a film and this is basically it.  S Darko makes Phantom Menace look like a bloody masterpiece and makes Manos Hands of Fate seem like an illuminated tapestry of clever continuity in comparison.  The acting in this film should be used in film school as an example of what not to do.  What is most noticeable is the complete lack of focus and direction.  There seems to be no tangible continuity to the film, instead it is a montage of bad, seemingly unconnected scenes that at their height only serve to make a mockery of Donnie Darko.  My girlfriend literally begged me to shut off this film.  S Darko achieves the noted unwatchable status in my movie experience as I sought to lessen my girlfriend's misery of having to endure this awful film.

Closing thoughts are it's like sorority girls who didn't know film wanted to make a remake of Thelma and Louise but ended up getting sidetracked by somebody in Utah that wanted to make a mockery of Donnie Darko in every form possible.

Then this movie was released, and I thought ""eh... I can hope.""  But somehow, it blew me away.  It managed to follow a tempo set by the original film, which I thought would be impossible.

The music, the FEELING, the thought involved in understanding...truly realizing there IS such depth to a film following a film with such incredible depth--- I could not BELIEVE it possible.  I've seen this film at least 6 times... stopped it halfway through a DVD the first time just so I could start again from a blue-ray...

Like the first, I forced people to watch a movie they never had heard of before... and I was NOT alone in appreciating it.

This isn't a true review I suppose.

But this deserves more than just a chance... so please, give it one... despite any negativity people might throw at you before-hand.  It IS worth that chance.",1378252800,,949,4.47093023255814

The main characters aren't all that interesting, with only a few of the supporting characters making an impression. Although the movie seemed to know what it was doing with it's own convoluted time travel logic it didn't seem to know what it had to say about the human condition, if anything. Which is a shame. I don't regret watching it -- if you're a curious Darko fan, you might as well rent it. Just expect very litttle.",1361836800,2,575,4.433962264150943
3777477,4,B001RP975Q,"I liked Donnie Darko so I went ahead and rented this one. It's a little weirder in my opinion because it's not real clear what's going on until the end. And the time traveling theme isn't as evident as it was in Donnie Darko. In that movie, Donnie was the only one experiencing the weird things happening to him, but in this one Samantha (his sister) doesn't really experience any of it. So it's a little harder to get in my opinion because I don't understand why she wouldn't be the center of it all since it's supposed to be a sequel and the movie is named after her. Basically, the plot happens around her and the ending is just a byproduct. But overall it was good.

2nd, this is the BEST movie of a philisophical nature I have EVER seen. Those of you who see this movie as nothing but a load of bull needs to take a philosophy class or two before making a judgement on it's subject matter.

The film extras help the film non experts like me but it really stayed with me and I started to think about it in a seriously different way and now I love it! I think about it so often its scary. It really is not a film for the "" I just want it to entertain me"" crowd. You need to watch and think with this and it will have a different meaning to many. The final kicker is that it has a killer soundtrack! The last song on the film is ""The Carnival Is Over"" by Dead Can't Dance and its a great song to end with being the most haunting beautiful song written. This is definately not a film for the masses but I am glad that it was able to be done by us few who appreciate such obscure film making and its meanings.",1326412800,10,889,3.89010989010989

Unlike some, I see no film about mental illness here.  And unlike others, I see no special talents concentrated in one family or small group.  Instead I see a subtle conversation about the nature of God and the underlying rules of the universe and how it operates.

S. Darko is DD turned inside out.  The guts of the machinery of time and destiny are spilled out for us to examine.  Alternate futures can be known, remembered, and communicated to our past selves so that choices made be made to avoid them.  And yes, every choice comes with a fee that must be paid.

Each player in the tale is jockeying for advantage, replaying each round, trying new strategies that shape their individual future more closely to their own ideal.

Iraq Jack, the ""receiver"" is also the willing sacrifice who gives his life so that Sam may live and so that his own pain may end and his sins may be washed cleaned by the fire.

Cory, as ""reciever"" also willingly sacrifices herself so that her friend may live.  Cory's participation in the scheme shows us that any and all of us may do so as well.

Samantha is the crux of the tale and it is her intense dissatisfaction with the futures that prompts this episode of negotiation with fate.  And completely out of keeping with the uninetrrupted string of self-sacrifice started by her brother, Sam the ""receiver"" refuses to sacrifice herself and leaves the ""manipulated dead"" to die, though I choose to believe that the ""manipulated dead"" Billy will continue to seek other receivers and will in the end negotiate his own ideal future,

S. Darko sticks with me and holds my hand, giving me comfort as I walk into my own future, every day negotiating with all around me to create a future one tiny bit closer to my dream ideal.",1303516800,2,1878,4.541666666666667
3777494,1,B001RP975Q,"Since I am not a huge fan of Richard Kelly's cult classic ""Donnie Darko"" (though I was impressed with its surreal visuals and concepts that kept me involved), I wasn't much shocked to hear the news of a sequel. You just can't stop movie producers from making one (remember ""The Hidden II""?). What is really shocking is that with head-scratching plot holes and cringe-inducing dialogues ""S. Darko"" is something else, something dull and pretentious.

""S. Darko"" is about Donnie's sister Samantha Darko (Daveigh Chase reprising her role in ""Donnie Darko""). It has been seven years since the events of the previous film. Samantha left her hometown, and is on the road trip with her best friend Corey (Briana Evigan). The two travelers get stuck in a small Utah town when their car breaks down. Well, I thought this is not a bad beginning. Turned out I was totally wrong.

For ""S. Darko"" is very boring by any standards. A series of things happens during Samantha's sojourn in the town, and they are virtually plucked from the original: a bunny mask, a meteorite hitting the windmill, countdown to the end of the world, etc. There are also a missing boy, Samantha's obsession about unicorn, ""Iran Jack"" and Pastor John Wayne (trying to imitate Patrick Swayze who was so good in ""Donnie Darko""). None of them intrigues us.

After all, it all comes down to this: we are not interested in Samantha. Frankly I don't know much about ""tangent universe"" in ""Donnie Darko."" I am not much interested in the plotlines or timelines of the original, but still I could relate to the angst-ridden protagonist played by Jake Gyllenhaal. ""Donnie Darko"" allows viewers to develop their own interpretations because of his character, which Samantha in ""S. Darko"" is not.",1298592000,,1746,4.872053872053872
3777495,1,B001RP975Q,"A Macbeth quote is far more succint and coherent than my own series of words I'd throw up on a screen to fully describe it.  My own words would be that it's a muddled, incoherent, rambling, meandering, scattershot, nonsensical, pretentious mess.  The cinematic equivalent of a fanboy wannabe re-creating her favorite film with her own touches to it, adding some esoteric meaning behind certain symbols or ideas beyond that of the first film, or entirely incidental, as if worshipping ""Donnie Darko"" so fanatically, every little detail is some meaningful icon.

Warning for potential spoilers.

The movie is one hour and forty minutes long approximately, and there is no coherent plot unfolding all the way into it.  Whereas ""Donnie Darko"" had the unifying thread of the world ending and Donnie having visions of Frank the bunny ordering him to do things, this EXACT SAME CONCEPT involving some random minor character is just one subplot to several other plot threads that have little to no relation to the ""Donnie Darko""-style plot unfolding in some small way, and in some cases turn out to be complete red herrings.

The characters involved are Samantha Darko and her friend Corey randomly driving to some random town in some random state.  I say ""random"" as placeholders, because I don't know what they're doing or why; no explanation is given or needed.  Corey's car breaks down, so Sam lays in the road until they hail down a guy in a red car called Randy, and they make friends with him and just start drifting aimlessly through life for the next few days, with Corey in particular drinking and partying a lot while S Darko looks vulnerable and gentle and acts nice to people Corey harasses for no reason.

They meet a nerdy-looking guy called Jeremy, played by Jackson Rathbone, and his role in the film is probably the most pointless.  His character just butts in to storylines, contributing nothing, being rejected, then growing a ""rash"" that looks like wads of furry plastic lava that is neither explained nor resolved in any way; it's just there for no reason, people notice it, and that's all.  His character arc ends in a way that had no buildup at all, no justification, and almost no relevance to the other plotlines at all.

Just about halfway through the film, it exposes itself as being pretty much a direct copy of Donnie Darko's plotline, involving ""portals"" or ""vortexes"" or ""black holes"" and ""alternate universes"" and objects from one universe appearing in another (as was the case with the jet engine that killed Donnie Darko), only this time, through a series of newspaper articles, it's pretty much explained that random things always fall from the sky or appear out of nowhere to kill random people for no reason.  And while Donnie was on an active quest to learn more about time travel, portals/vortexes, multiple universes, etcetera, Samantha's whole quest for this solely involves asking if black holes are part of God's plan, and a throwaway reference to vortexes mentioned by someone at some point.

There's a guy called Justin who is the town nutsack who everyone has no problem talking about wanting to kill him, and who acts crazy, and is haunted by the same sorts of ghostythings that Donnie saw in the form of Frank the bunny.  This time, the ghosty-thing is in the form of Samantha Darko herself, who just like Frank, perpetually sports the outfit she was wearing at the time of her death, and the wound that caused it.  The same dealy with Billy, a boy who is missing, and whose storyline is a COMPLETE and TOTAL red herring, contributing NOTHING AT ALL to the story at all.

The point where the film starts becoming a blatant ""Donnie Darko"" ripoff occurs when Corey insults Samantha on the side of the road, while in a car with Randy and some friends, getting herself kicked out of the car, and another car appears out of nowhere and smashes into his car.  Somehow, Samantha ends up dead, and OUT OF NOWHERE, Corey starts becoming interested in time travel and the stuff involved in ""Donnie Darko"".  Rather than taking an entire film of exploration and discovery and hidden messages, she somehow figures it out within a few minutes into the movie, and goes back in time to save Samantha, while she ends up dead herself in the same accident.

After this, a whole lot of nothing happens.  Another red herring appears in the cool, hot young priest guy who is a sexual predator and pedophile, a BLATANT ripoff of Patrick Swayze's character in ""Donnie Darko"", except with absolutely NO purpose whatsoever.  He tries to molest Samantha in a theater, but that's about it.

The end part involves Justin, who is actually Roberta Sparrow's grandson, being the ""Donnie Darko"" of this tale; as Donnie was drawn out of his house by ghosty-Frank just as the jet engine destroyed his room, Jack was drawn off of a windmill by ghosty-Samantha just as a meteor destroyed it.  So he goes back in time, stays on the mill, and gets killed by the meteor, and both Samantha and Corey get to live.  Up until this point, Justin was barely characterized, barely fleshed out, and barely introduced as being anything more than a living plot device, and suddenly he becomes the ""sacrificial victim"" for the girls to survive.  For no reason except to connect it to ""Donnie Darko"", he creates a creepy-bunny mask just like Frank did in the first film.

A lot of decisions made in the movie exist solely to be pretentious, to present a moody, surreal, artistic look, desperately trying to MEAN something, and yet ultimately meaning nothing.

- The bunny mask
- Billy, the missing boy
- The mirror-reversed movie marquee scene
- The car suddenly appearing out of nowhere to cause the accident
- Tiny meteors randomly striking the Earth at the end, which NO ONE NOTICES
- A tesseract traveling through some sort of portal-tube
- Jeremy's ""rash""
- Jeremy
- The Pastor
- Trudy (the woman obsessed with the pastor)
- The watery tube-things that come out of certain people (the mystique of which is completely destroyed in one scene when the ghosty-Billy tells Corey to bring her 'water')
- Samantha's obsession with unicorns
- Justin burning down a church at ghosty-Samantha's bidding (same as in Donnie Darko)
- The motel guy and his obsession with the meteor that hit the windmill

All that I listed there had literally NOTHING to do with the plot at all.  ALL of those were complete red herrings.  Some were there only to complete the blatant ripoff of the plot to ""Donnie Darko"".  Others were just there for their own sake.",1295654400,3,6529,4.770870337477797

3777497,1,B001RP975Q,"I can remember a defining moment for me in this film when, only a few minutes in, the titular character looks out her car window and sees a CGI unicorn made of clouds running alongside her. I immediately reached for my gun, but a compassionate friend stopped me, ensuring me that this couldn't possibly be the two hour long Guess Jeans commercial it was setting itself up to be.

My friend was damn wrong.

S. Darko is a sequel, like Troll 2 or the Second World War. The direction is hopelessly one-note and plagiaristic, the dialogue is reminiscent of a TV spot for Calvin Klein cologne, and the story is less a sequel, and more an accidental anthology of mini sequels, each sucking a little harder than the last.

Remember the pensive sequences in Donnie Darko where they'd show a time lapse of cloud cover, or morose suburbanites living out their lives to a somber soundtrack? Well, this movie does, and is considerate enough to include 50 or 60 shot-for-shot reproductions of those scenes for those who might've forgotten. With the bulk of the movie thus out of the way, the remaining running time is filled with multiple time travels that are impossible to care about, because they're established, abandoned, and picked up again like a relay baton in the Special Olympics.

Also, the principle relationship between Sam and her idiot friend is painfully bad. You know the one: lifelong friends who have been forged in the crucible of adolescence to become blood sisters. A bond so close that they can only communicate their intimate connection through the following dialogue:

Girl 1: ""We're perfect together.""
Girl 2: ""Immaculate.""

I am not making that up. That back and forth happens at least three times. Also, Sam's friend all but spits on her grave over a guy who the friend hooked up with over the course of maybe a week. A guy who ALWAYS has a pack of cigarettes rolled up in his shirt sleeve, exactly like how NO ONE does. The blood is rushing into my eyes again, so I have to stop this now.",1291593600,87,2004,4.646892655367232
3777498,1,B001RP975Q,"S. Darko is awful. It has way too many sub-plots for the length of the film, and none of them are done enough justice to be included. Even the ""point"" of Sam's time traveling isn't given enough attention, and loose ends are left all over the place. The acting is horrible; really, truly terrible. Maybe that was the director's fault. I can't get into everything that is wrong with this movie without spoiling it, but just know that it is awful, and I have a guilty pleasure for semi-bad movies.

This film is a disaster of epic proportions, and I'm not saying that because I liked the first Darko film. This movie is bad enough without being compared to its predecessor.",1291420800,,670,4.537190082644628
3777499,2,B001RP975Q,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a sequel or an homage, but what it isn't is a cohesive, quality movie in its own right. Much if not all of the imagery, and the basic premises, are entirely taken from the original film, AND it doesn't even use them well.

Donnie Darko is a brilliant movie because it takes surreal elements such as Fred, the life paths, and time travel, really introduces and justifies them to the audience, and then uses them to tell a compelling story with a beginning, middle, and end. This film incorporates the life paths, but to no particular purpose. They get one character from point a to point b, and that's it. There is no reason for them to even be included.

The time travel/sacrifice ""bit"" that absolutely made Donnie Darko is used again, not once but twice. I might excuse it if it were to save two different people, but they were both for Sam. Not that she wasn't lovely and compelling, but really. That just seems greedy. The worst part, though, is that the second ""rewind"" brings us back to a status quo with a little boy dying of starvation in a cave. No good movie ever, ever ends with children dying cold and alone.

Nothing, in short, is resolved. The two friends don't even make up; Sam returns to a family situation that is only making her miserable, leaving Corey to ""crash for something like ever"" in the middle of nowhere. Both of their projected futures are incredibly bleak. Perhaps Corey is meant to find some kind of happiness with Randy, but if she were, I think it would be indicated earlier.

Speaking of Randy, why does he even exist? (Except to be pretty I mean) He has a moment of empathy with Sam over their dead brothers, but other than that he's a free-floating plot point that goes from seemingly unnecessary to downright awkward when he tries to reconnect with both Corey and Sam after having inadvertently killed their best friend.

In fact, most of the characters have no seeming purpose or arc. Jeremy at first seems like he's going to turn out to be the good guy that Corey writes off for no good reason, but he seems to prove that first judgments are oddly accurate. Pastor John is just creepy throughout the film, and he is never called to account for his actions, nor is Trudy. Iraq Jack is less purposeless, but his arc is basically a bastardized version of Donnie's in the first film, which brings me to my next point: who is this film about, anyway?

The first film is clearly and exclusively ""about"" Donnie: it is his character arc that drives the plot, and it is told from his perspective. This film jumps around with no clear purpose. From the title, one would think it is about Sam, but Fisher can't seem to resist turning the ethereal young beauty into the victim not once, but twice. It takes a brief stint in Corey's mind when she makes a brief foray into whatever mental state implies the ability to see visions in this film (I doubt it's paranoid schizophrenia again, but as it's never properly defined, I couldn't tell you), which is never dealt with again either in regards to Corey's mental state or her relationship with Sam. They seem closer in that moment than they ever behave face-to-face. Thence, it switches back and forth from Sam's relatively normal perspective to Iraq Jack's, in which Sam plays the Frank figure. Iraq Jack, unlike Donnie, is not even lucid enough to demonstrate any concrete motives, so his actions seem like random ravings guided only by the filmmakers' desire to constantly reference the first movie.

It simply borrows bits and pieces from the original movie (which was brilliant) and throws them together hap hazardly. For example a copy of the rabbit mask that featured in the first movie was made by a character in this one out of welded metal, he the proceeds to force it on his head. But why? In the first movie there was a point the the rabbit mask, in the second it was as though the script writer thought ""oh crap, we'd better get that in somewhere so it looks like the original"" and just stuffed it in anywhere. Richard Kelly created one of the most enigmatic, clever and interesting movies in Donnie Darko. What happened in S Darko? Did Richard refuse to write another so they formed a committee to create a script? I get the impression that the writers watched Donnie Darko, didn't understand a word of it then tried to recreate it in the way a junior high school student cuts and pastes a bad essay from wikipedia. The only good thing I'd say is that Briana Evigan looks stunning throughout the movie.

At one point, we leave the main character Sam entirely and focus through the eyes of her best friend, which totally throws off the perspective. We journey back in time a few times, when once would have sufficed, to correct any wrong past occurences. It seems we never save the little boy, and he is the reason we begin this adventure into another realm/parallel universe.

This movie cannot be viewed on it's own, because the whole premise of this movie is that we've seen Donnie Darko. Having said that, this movie insults my intelligence. It takes a movie that requires you to think about it, and asks that you just mindlessly absorb the sequel and ooh and ahh at it's rehashed images of the original. If anyone was smart enough to understand Donnie Darko, how can they be stupid enough to buy anything this movie is trying to sell? So Samantha Darko has a drawing that Donnie did of Frank, who, in the timeline that survived in the first movie, never existed in the first place. She also has a book that, again, was never given to Donnie in the timeline that she is from. So if we just ignore those two, glaring omissions to logic, we can continue to watch the movie. The acting is not horrible for a straight to video release (you don't agree? go watch any of the 35 straight to video movies Steven Segal has put out in the last few years and then tell me this is horrible acting) and I can somewhat be entertained by the first portion of the movie. The second half of the movie is really just rehashing some scenes from Donnie Darko, over and over, for no real apparent reason. **Spoilers (haha) ahead** They really liked filming the silent montage of various scenes in the movie in reverse, as this was done multiple times. The main character dies at least twice, and all sorts of other characters seem to have Donnies powers of time travel. Why? Good question. I have no idea. The super-nerd gets meteroite-enhanced powers of uhhhh, festering sores, and then promptly disappears and is not heard from again, nor is any explaination given as to why any of that is happening. Everything is heavily based on Roberta Sparrow's Philosophy of Time Travel, which we could only know anything about if we'd seen not just Donnie Darko, but the Directors cut of Donnie Darko, which actually explained what was going on. So to say I'm not viewing this movie on it's own, only comparing it to Donnie Darko, well, if I hadn't seen Donnie Darko, I would have absolutely no idea what anything in this movie was even attempting to portray, so you kind of have to have seen the original. If this movie had been anything more than a poor attempt at re-hashing a great movie it may have stood a chance. It is obviously just a cash grab aimed at fans of Donnie Darko, and should in no way be seen as a decent movie on it's own. I was just curious, so I rented it, and it wasn't as bad as a lot of people said it was (see, I gave it 2 stars?) but it was by no means a good movie, or a worthy sequel.

3777507,2,B001RP975Q,"To be fair, ""S. Darko"" is at a disadvantage to begin with simply for being the sequel to one of the most defining cult films of my generation. How do you begin to follow up a film that countless folks adore and identify with? Well, I doubt we'll ever know, since the overpowering blunder of this movie ought to guarantee that nobody's about to try to make another sequel for a long time. Plainly, ""S. Darko"" is a contrived mess: imagine a director taking an ambitious fanfiction as his plot foundation, realizing halfway through production that the story is too inconsistent and scatterbrained for its own good, and trying to patch up its inefficiencies with numerous go-nowhere references from the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko/dp/B0000AC8LR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko</a>&nbsp;in hopes that allusions alone would make it a better movie. That is what this film feels like.

The story: seven years after the events of the first movie, a haunted Samantha Darko (Daveigh Chase) escapes her home on a cross-country trip with her wild friend Corey (Briana Evigan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Up-2-The-Streets/dp/B0012QCZ54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Up 2 The Streets</a>). When their car breaks down outside of a small desert town and they're left without connections while waiting for repairs, both girls find themselves caught up in a strange series of events that include a meteorite destroying a windmill, prophetic dreams, a disturbed Gulf War veteran (James Lafferty,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Tree-Hill/dp/B0006FFRBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Tree Hill</a>), and a missing child - all of which lead up to the inevitable end of the world.

I'm not a hardcore fan of the first movie, so I won't pretend to know whether the science of this one comes together as cleanly as it did in the original. However, there's no denying that it feels contrived: while the first movie featured excellent pacing and practiced moderation with its weirdness, it seems like the director of this one - Chris Fisher (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nightstalker/dp/B000K7UHEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nightstalker</a>) - took his favorite parts of the first flick and overdid them to the point that there's absolutely nothing special or remarkable about the supernatural occurrences. No less than three Frank-type characters walk around speaking with weird vocal effects; jarring time-rewinds happen twice so certain characters can be brought back from death from minutes prior; Sam glows underwater and sees CGI horses in the clouds...and it all seems to mean very little, since the conclusion has very littleweight and certainly doesn't explain what greater good has come of this adventure.

To its credit, ""S. Darko"" is remarkably good-looking for a low-budget flick, with great production values and featuring a unique cast that includes John Hawkes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadwood/dp/B001FA1OTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadwood</a>), Jackson Rathbone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B002KGVB8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;series), Elizabeth Berkley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showgirls/dp/0792844882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showgirls</a>), and Matthew Davis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-About-Brian/dp/B000P6YNT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What About Brian</a>). But again, in the end, it all means very little since minimal effort has been focused toward crafting something original. It really seems like the director wised up to the how mediocre the screenplay was halfway through, but instead of attempting an emergency rewrite, he started inserting references to the original film left and right, as though hoping that viewers would get lost in reminiscent rapture and stop paying attention to how silly what they're watching is. Little things like sped-up cloudscapes and quotes galore (e.g. ""They made me do it"") stand in the foreground of individual scenes (e.g. sitting in an empty movie theater) and bigger plot devices (e.g. a benevolent figure revealed as a pervert) ripped directly from the original movie. Come on! - did we really wait eight years just to watch a rehash of the first film?

I knew that ""Donnie Darko"" was too singular a movie to have any kind of follow-up do it justice, but nevertheless, it was cool to imagine what such an attempt would bring. Well, now I know, but it's probably for the best if most other people remain ignorant.

Even going in with low expectations (I never trust sequels) I was disappointed by this film. Right off the bat it said to me, ""Hi, I'm an art film. I'm full of brooding, sexy characters doing and saying things for inexplicable reasons. Even my outcasts and nerds are attractive people in glasses and high-water pants."" Forty minutes into the film I replied to it, ""You don't have characters, you have caricatures."" The nerd was a total social misfit with feigned awkwardness, the cool kids were, as mentioned, brooding and sexy and had no sympathy toward the nerd (who turned out to be secretly creepy). There were Christians in the movie, but they were, of course, closet child-molesters and seemed incapable of finishing a conversation without mentioning that they know Jesus. They were framing the local Gulf War veteran, who was inevitably crazy, for their crimes. The ex-soldier was guilt-ridden for war-crimes he committed... oddly all things that sounded like Viet Nam and certainly not the Gulf War of the early 1990's. There was a farmer who was an ignoramus and didn't know the difference between ""Apocalypse"" and ""Acropolis"" and a cop who looked like a male stripper getting ready for his act at the bachelorette party. The aging waitress at the diner liked to talk about how she was attractive when she was young. Oh, and inevitably, the drunk-driving jerk cool-kid turns out to be the most decent guy in town.
What the movie lacked was any of the mystery of Donnie Darko. It was a showcase for pretty people to act brooding and sexy and turn out to be attractive nerds. While I know I will watch the original again and enjoy it. I may not ever view this film again.",1266364800,9,1757,4.707792207792208

I bought this movie hoping that it would be well made and interesting, even if it might be an insult to the original like alot of sequels are. Well, turns out it isn't particularly well made or interesting, and is an insult to the original. The filmmakers were in a virtual no win situation in that they would have to hit one out of the park to satisfy fans of Donnie Darko, and those who never saw DD would probably be scratching their heads wondering what the heck was going on. The script was pretty bad with lines like, ""What do you think God's farts taste like""? ""Marshmallow Peeps"". Awesome. The character, or charicatures if you will, were unlikable cliches of slutty party girl, hopelessly marose girl, nerdy guy, religious zealots, overcompensating cool drunk guy with his smokes rolled up in the sleeve of his T-shirt, just like the cool guys in real life, and mentally unhinged war vet. The acting was stiff and uninspired, as was the directing, editing, special FX.... The guy playing Iraq Jack was the only one who seemed to be trying at all. The meteor shower of the appocalypse at the end had all the fury of snow flakes and went unnoticed by the actors. Maybe it was a last minute addition to really turn up the excitement.

3777512,3,B001RP975Q,"As a HUGE fan of the original Donne Darko, I was very excited to see that this movie had been released, even though I really should know better. Great movies don't need sequels. (I ignore the second and third Matrixes also.)

I will say I actually enjyed it when I viewed it on its own merits. The acting was decent though the direction was weak, the cinematography was very pretty indeed, and if you like coming of age stories, you might like this all right.

However, if the first movie happened as stated, then this film could not have occurred. Sam possesses Donnie's copy of Roberta Sparrow's book, with his drawings of Frank's mask in it. Um, No.

Also, the general flavor of the movie is so very different that it cannot but fail to create a franchise. While Donnie Darko was funny and insightful throughout most of it, S. Darko is tenaciously unwilling to amuse.

Overall, I really wish the writer had explored his own ideas, for they were present, and saught to write an independent film, leaving the heavy handed Donnie Darko-isms at the door. The movie is so busy tying all the Donnie Darko flavored time travel stuff into the story that every single original plot point goes unresolved.

I liked that it showed things from the POV of the manipulated dead, which gave things a neat twist and kept the movie from getting stale.

The cast was surprisingly good. Had a different actress been cast than Daveigh Chase, I don't know if the story would have held up as well, though.

The music was okay, but it did not serve as a cohesive element like in ""Donnie Darko"". The plot at times was a bit predictable, but that did not take away from my enjoyment.

There was one subplot which never got resolved once time reverted to ""normal"", which made the ending sort of harsh and disturbing.

3777517,3,B001RP975Q,"S. DARKO, the, ahem, ""continuation, not sequel"" to Richard Kelly's 2001 masterpiece, DONNIE DARKO is - after having actually watched it a couple of times - not as bad as I'd imagined it might be. It'd be all too easy to simply dismiss it outright as a lesser film than Kelly's original, but that would be to ignore the definite positive aspects of this new Darko tale.

First and foremost of these ""positives"" would have to be Daveigh Chase who brings a quiet dignity and genuine pathos to the title role which she originally brought to life in ""Donnie Darko"" , albeit as a child (whose seemingly only memorable contribution to that film was to ask ""what's a f*** a**?""). It's just such a pity that her role wasn't developed more considerably; her role should have been less passive and displayed a little more of the antagonistic, anarchic character so evident in Donnie; Now I'm not saying she should've been a totally antagonistic character, it's just that I can't help but feel she would have reacted to the minister's ""advances"" a lot less passively and much more with the ""fire"" that Donnie was apt to display in similar situations. In fact it's a crime that none of the characters in this film were developed beyond much more than standard tropes and stereotypes. This is the biggest point of difference between Kelly's & Fisher's ""Darko"" films. Kelly (being also the writer) made damn sure that all of his characters lived and breathed convincingly as well as with a definite, particular dash of humor intercut throughout. Whereas Fisher doesn't seem all that bothered with characterisation; S. Darko being more of an event-driven film where characters merely react to plot contrivances and genre gimmickry. I suppose that's almost understandable if you're making a sequel, but given that the makers went to such strains to point out that this was a ""continuation"" , well, there can really be no forgiving for the lack of character detail/development. As it stands, S. Darko is more of a short story compared to Kelly's more expansive, Stephen King-like novel. Or rather, S. Darko is like a standard King film adaptation, while Kelly has made more of a faithful adaptation, page-by-page no less, of King, if you get my meaning.

Marvin V. Rush's cinematography is impressive and at times even breath-taking. Given the Utah desert-scapes, it could've been filmed on VHS (as opposed to digital) and it still would've looked nothing short of amazing, but that's not to detract from Rush's work. (1 hour, 13 minutes into the film, the shot of Sam emerging from the ""cave"" (with Iraq Jack looming overhead) is very much like a classic shot from Peter Weir's classic, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK; coincidence? Something more? What I have sampled of the commentary makes no mention of this, so I can only wonder, perhaps...)

The wonderful scoring of Ed Harcourt is just as mesmerising as the original Donnie Darko score; I've downloaded the soundtrack off iTunes and it really is a nice score that fits in perfectly with Kelly's Darko-verse, very haunting, melancholic and at times even playful without being derivative or uninspired. Major kudos, IMO.

The character of Iraq Jack is nicely acted but again is so far underdeveloped and underused that he really only remains a peripheral archetype, not much more. (SPOILER ALERT>>> and just what was the go with his name? Jack Sparrow? I mean, yes, he's related to Grandma Death, but c'mon, I was half-expecting Davy Jones to make an appearance, for those who didn't make the connection)

Almost all of the other characters were of varying degrees of annoyance/detestability that I found myself not really caring what happened to any of them. Briana Evigan was particularly annoying and, yes, I know that's how the role was (mostly) written, I just didn't feel that there was any redeeming aspects to her character's arc at all. When she and ""James Dean-wannabe"" were standing outside the library and Corey says ""I'd do anything to take it all back"" , either a bad take was used or she really is that unconvincing an actress. It was like she didn't want to be there.

And don't get me started on the worst Christian stereotypes ever used in a modern movie... Talk about heavy-handed. Methinks that when Sam looks up on the movie screen and she sees a clip from the original DONNIE that it really is a sign from God, Himself that He wants for her to be in a better film than this dreck, but I digress... I mean, yes I'm not forgetting that Richard Kelly took his own pot-shots at quasi-Christian do-gooder types, but I believe that Kelly's sense of humor was far more spot-on and his sense of criticism was of a much broader, more societal scope lampooning the overall hypocrisy inherent in the so-called Moral Majority-types than simply stating that Christianity, for example, was/is bad, as seems to be how the makers of S. Darko have formed and delivered their criticism.

Overall, this movie stands as a failure lacking in conviction as well as a genuine artistic vision. It's merely a ""product"" to ""further a franchise."" More Terminator 3 than T2. Entire parts of this film tend not to make much sense when compared with the universe that Richard Kelly established. The opening crawl of S. Darko establishes that the Darko family has pretty much splintered as a result of Donnie's death (by being crushed by the falling plane engine), but if you listen to Kelly's commentary on the Director's Cut, he clearly states the significance of using both ""Never Tear Us Apart"" songs on the film's soundtrack -- that the Darko family would hold together through this crisis, essentially symbolizing how mankind and the Middlesex community would be saved. And exactly how does Sam come into possession of ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"" book? The commentary/special features hint at how she discovered it among Donnie's personal effects, but since he is given the book by Dr. Monnitoff AFTER the instance of the plane engine falling on their house, then it is actually removed from ever coming to be by Donnie dying at film's end. Chris Fisher clearly states he had problems using the dance footage from DONNIE DARKO and says how the footage never actually happens because of Donnie's death, so I can't help but think, well, if that's the case, then the entirety of S. Darko is either rendered completely flawed as a result, or what?? it exists in it's own tangent universe? This is not ""mystery"" but rather mere ""confusion/contradiction."" In point of fact, any and all ""mystery"" that occurs throughout this movie tends to be more of the contrived/forced nature than that of a more ""David Lynchian-type"" that Richard Kelly so expertly managed to pull off in the original DARKO. The whole plot point of the missing kids is never really explained or solved. We never really get to find out who was the perpetrator of these crimes. Just that the entire community believes, conveniently, that Iraq Jack was behind it.

So much COULD have been done to make this film stand as a worthwhile, unique film in it's own right as well as contribute to the Darko lore, but the film makers were surely content to settle on second-best, formulaic shock tactics over any sense of real substance. (IMO, The BUTTERFLY EFFECT was the ""original"" attempt to make something of a follow-on to DONNIE, and that was such a ""failed"" movie that served to show how one doesn't do a DONNIE-type follow-up, but alas...)

I can't help but wonder if the producers entertained making a follow-on focusing on Seth Rogen's character, seeing how popular he is these days. It wouldn't surprise me, knowing how mercenary producers tend to think.

Oh, and one last thing before I disappear into my own tangent universe, so to speak, did anyone notice the cloud formation next to the windmill in the UTAH TOO MUCH special feature, 4 mins, 36 secs. into it. Doesn't it look just like a rabbit head? Hmmmm...",1248998400,2,7906,4.845299777942265

Donnie Darko was truly an original and memorable movie. Darko was written and directed by a young and gifted filmmaker named Richard Kelly. The movie struck a massive chord with its intended audience after the studio botched its theatrical run. The DVD sold like hotcakes and was one of my favorite films of 2001. Flash forward to the here and now and we have S. Darko, a pseudo-intellectual wet noodle of a debacle. S. Darko is nearly unwatchable and easily the worst film of the year so far. Poorly acted (most of the miscast young actors stumble around vacantly and able to produce a single emotion), written, and directed, its a miserable movie-watching experience.

S. Darko is about Donnie's sister Samantha (a broody and sullen Emo) who wanders around with another sneering Emo on a road trip to So Cal. Their car breaks down in a hellish small town in Utah populated by a hunky mechanic (a comatose Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl). Chuck smokes and tries to look edgy and seductive in Hanes white T-shirts in an odd bid to prove his heterosexuality, but he fails miserably, much like the movie in general. The other characters include Iraq Jack (wtf), a totally miscast and awful James Lafferty of the popular CW teen soap One Tree Hill. We also get a dumb cop, freaky Christians and an embarrassed looking Elizabeth Berkley of Showgirls and Saved by the Bell fame, blurting out some of the worst dialogue ever written. The plot has the basic conceits of the first film, minus any kind of menace, style, or wit. The bunny mask is there, the head has barbed wire around it so Iraq Jack can mutilate himself. A gratuitous and gruesome scene ensues. There's so many holes in the movie, I lost track after 50 or so. At one point meteorites start falling all around and no one seems to notice or care. The combination of the awful CGI and the non-reaction from the dead cast did produce some laughs. At this point I lost the will to keep going.

S. Darko sucks. Fans of the original movie deserve better than this turd. This film should have never been made. I lost at least 20 IQ points during this flick. I need to rinse the memory of this flick from my mind forever. I still have no idea what possessed me to watch this movie in the first place, I knew it was going to be terrible.

In my opinion this movie is a lot more interesting than the origional Donnie Darko movie. The only problem with this movie is that it is deep and you have to think about it to understand the movie. There is a slight cliffhanger at the end but I feel it will make more sense when I watch it a second time. The effects where awsome and the story was gripping. I think this movie was a masterpeice.,1244851200,2,551,3.8849557522123894

Did we really need infectious extraterrestrial hypercubes falling from the sky??? This isn't mysterious--it's just dumb. All of the characters were lame to boot.

3777534,1,B001RP975Q,"I tried to accept it as a stand-alone project, rather than a continuation of the classic ""Donnie Darko"".  Sadly, this film doesn't work on either level.
  ""S. Darko"" is a film sorely lacking a plot, clarifying (or even multi-syllabic) dialog, or particularly interesting characters.  References are lifted from ""Donnie Darko"" and sprinkled on top of what really is a scrap of story.  Whereas every element in DD served a purpose and left you genuinely wondering why and how the Tangent Universe existed, what is reality or fantasy, and had a likeable cast and was filmed with sly humor, SD is a ragtage assemblage of one-dimensional characters that drift in and out but explain nothing. Nothing becomes clearer on repeated viewings or from the Director's commentary. Being confusing or writing a poor screenplay is not the same as being cryptic or clever.
  The film itself has some impressive scenery of Utah at its disposal, but otherwise the special effects and sets are of low quality. As mentioned, the dialog is just awful. The mid-90's timeframe is not utilized as was 1988 so successfully in DD.  In fact, this could take place in any small town.  Instead, we're in ""Conejo"" (Rabbit) Springs, Utah, where there's an auto repair shop named ""Frank's"" and a reappearance of the bunny mask.  All these winks to the original deserve better explanation than just being random placements. There's a character ""Iraq Jack"" who looks vaguely like Jake Gyllenhaal, and he, along with Samantha, are the only ties to the original that could have been developed in a way to give this film a point.  But they're not.  The much-discussed ""twist"" is neither shocking or effective in setting up any conflict or resolution.  At the end, one is left wondering not ""What happened"", but ""why did someone go to the effort of making a 100+ minute film where nothing makes sense""?

From the original movie, the main character Donnie had a somewhat super hero attitude feel to it; while the second movie is more of a fairy tale; dealing with the main character Samantha.  Even the creators (who are fans of the first movie) say that the second movie is more of a ""continuation"" rather than a ""true sequel.""
Since the two movies are based in two different time periods (1988 and 1995) and also two different main characters; it is to be expected that they are not going to feel the same.
I personally admire the hard efforts that the people who had created this movie.  I also hope to see another continuation within the universe of Donnie Darko by either the original creators, the people who made the second installment, and/or by more fans of the original movie who want to expand the world of Donnie Darko.

I can see everyone is in frantic discussion here so before I allow my thoughts to be invaded by others opinions here are my thoughts, very fresh ones, because I am watching the credits roll now.

First of all this took a second evening for me to finish, last night I had to turn it off - it was really frustrating me with bad acting and an almost 'made for tv' feel.

With a glass of wine and a little something to snack on I could sit and let this movie run itself out to the end, and wow, what a poorly made movie considering the interesting premise it was based upon. Time travel, trippy sci-fi alternate universes, and such ... I usually really can get into. X-Files meets Final Destination ... but this was just about unbearable.

I think the positive aspect of this movie were a number of well composed very cinematic scenes, and the montage at the end with the Cocteau Twin track running. That is really it, and I challenge anyone with taste to find something else. I think the director should do music videos, but no more films please without a lot of outside advice.

This had a decent amount of potential.  It was basically what Donnie Darko would have been if the tale had been told from the perspective of Frank of Bunny instead of Donnie.  Plus, for a direct to DVD movie, I thought the acting wasn't all that bad.  Daveigh Chase did a phenonial job.  For the originality of the different perspective in the story and the decent acting (the soundtrack wasn't bad either) I gave it the extra star.  But, honestly, how I felt after I finished the movie made me really want to only give a 1-star review.

I think my biggest complaint was that the original Darko movie wrapped up all the loose ends nicely, and there were a lot more ""ah-ha!"" type of moments.  This movie really lacked that.  Plus, there was just so much that didn't make sense.  Such as the feather that was grabbed from the television set.  What on earth was THAT all about?  Plus, having lived in Utah a lot of my life... and having spent a large amount of time in small Utah towns, I can attest that they didn't capture the real essence of a small Utah town in the desert at all.  It was more like this was filmed in New Mexico or something.

Their car soon breaks down in a desert town in Utah where the first night of their breakdown a meteorite crashes that creates a fracture in time. Think I'm ruining it? The movie does that 10 minutes in and it is no big mystery.

The casting was a little strange, because too many members of the cast looked similar.

Without the charm and quirky humor it made the movie a chore to watch. It seemed very long and didn't quite make sense. Didn't make sense to the point there had to be two or three wormholes by the end of the movie. The fact that the evil bunny appears in the movie made little to no sense considering Frank wasn't in the movie, or in the time zone.

At best it was ranged somewhere between enjoyable, confusing and inferior. Reviews at their worst described it as a downright abomination.
I remember seeing the original ""Donnie Darko"" at a special screening back in 2001. Not many people got it back then either. I felt at times I was one of the only few who understood its powerful message and feared it would be another wonderful movie underrated and lost among the multi million dollar trash that Hollywood would churn out that same year.
Flash forward two years later and suddenly everyone was in love with ""Donnie Darko"". It had found a new life and a new appreciative audience on DVD. It suddenly became a modern cult movie. Everyone was talking ""Donnie Darko"". Now we could all re-watch it over and over, make up our own minds about it and scan the Internet for theories and explanations to back up our own way out philosophies. Funnily enough, I feel the same fate awaits ""S. Darko"".

SPOILERS.........................

""S. Darko"" starts its story in 1995, seven years after the events of the original ""Donnie Darko"". Now teenaged, Samantha Darko (underplayed beautifully by the originals Daveigh Chase) is midway through a road trip with her best friend Corey and literally on a journey of self-discovery. We are told of her disconnection with her family since the death of her older brother Donnie and quickly learn of her inability to remember her dreams and her odd sleepwalking habits. As fate would have it their car breaks down just outside a small Utah town and it is here that Samantha begins to unravel the mystery of the visions that we see plague her nightmares. If you are familiar with the original characters Donnie was a ""living receiver"" and the ""Manipulated dead"" was Frank the Bunny whose future deceased personality communicates with the ""living receiver"" to help them discover the path that destiny has laid out for them and in turn save the deceased from dying. Here the roles are switched around. Samantha has become the ""Manipulated dead"" which explains why she cannot remember her dreams where her future deceased personality guides a ""Living receiver"" known as Iraq Jack, a young veteran of the Gulf War who's odd behaviour and rambling conjectures are passed off by the townsfolk as someone living with post traumatic stress. To say anymore would ruin the overall outcome of the movie but suffice to say that it does share a similar plotline with the original, at times even mirroring its eccentric characters. I have a feeling however that there is also a lot more to come in the ""..Darko"" world. There was a reason why Donnie sacrificed his life to save Samantha from the plane crash and her journey is far from over with this film.

Other elements worth noting are its beautiful cinematography, which captures the strikingly odd landscape of the Utah desert and its score, although not dissimilar to the original, is haunting in its own inimitable way.
Although arguably inferior in style and structure to the ""Donnie Darko"", like its brethren, ""S. Darko"" will slowly but surely grow in mass appeal.",1242345600,7,3312,4.8584070796460175
3777550,3,B001RP975Q,"1. I think the idea of telling the story from the point of view of the Manipulated Dead instead of the Living Reciever was great. 2. I think the idea of continuing the story using Samantha Darko was great. 3. I believe Iraq Jack was a brilliant character.

These great ideas, unfortunately were poorly executed. Here's why I think this way:

1. As I have watched Donnie Darko, I have certainly wondered what it was like for Frank the Bunny. He was the second most important character in Donnie Darko but we know virtally nothing about him. So I could certainly understand why someone would want to write a movie from this perspective. I think the reason it was so poorly done in the movie is because the idea that Samantha Darko would be the Manipulated Dead is just downright stupid and illogical. The Manipulated Dead should have been a completely different character.

2. Continuing the tale from Samantha Darko's perspective is brillant. Why? Because she would have found the book The Philosophy of Time Travel. She would have been motivated to find out why her brother had this book and what the book meant. She could have tracked down someone who knew Roberta Sparrow, leading her to Iraq Jack. Then Fisher (the director)could have explored Roberta's back story like he said he considered doing in the special features on the DVD. Perhaps Corey could have still been a part of it. A friend occupying her on her journey trying to run from her past, while Samantha was trying to find information so she could understand hers.

3. And while these two young women are trying to deal with their past, Samantha meets Iraq Jack (and some of the towns characters. A few of them were nothing but filler in this movie.). The character of Iraq Jack was the one character that the creators got right in this movie. Unfortunately, they do very little to let us get to know him. In Donnie Darko, Donnie's identity and angst was explored in great detail. The creators of this movie should have done the same with Iraq Jack, exploring the depths of his post traumatic stress disorder and need to do something to right all his wrongs. If Samantha had watched his life unfold in a similar way that Donnie's had, she could have understood what Donnie went through, realized her brother was a hero, and made peace with his death. Samantha would have had a huge character change by the end and been a lot less passive.

Ultimately, I think the director Chris Fisher made a fairly good fan fiction movie, but nothing more. I give the movie 3 stars because there were some brillant ideas in there. Samantha's role as the Manipulated Dead does perhaps help us understand the incredible character of Frank the Bunny a bit more. I think the subplot of the asteroid affecting the person studying it was vulgar and ruined the beauty and mystery of the Donnie Darko universe. It just didn't fit in with the rest of the story. The asteroid shower was hardly end of the world like. The scene where Iraq Jack goes back to the windmill to change his fate was great but everything else just fizzles at the end.

In the special features, nearly everyone's gut reation to the idea of making a continuation of Dannie Darko was DON'T! The fact that The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko was somewhat poorly recieved should have made Fisher realize his continuation would not be well received. It's almost as if he thought, ""Die hard fans will hate this movie, but they will still want to see it."" There just seems to be something very wrong with that.

3777554,5,B001RP975Q,"This sequel to Richard Kelly's cult fave DONNIE DARKO, debuting on disc from Fox Home Entertainment, isn't the completely awful film many thought it would be (or wanted it to be), but it's not great by any means, and many of its flaws derive from how this continuation adapts the original's mythology and concepts. So take note: This review may become a bit spoiler-heavy. For those who want to sit this review out until they see the film, know simply that S. DARKO may be intriguing enough to be worth a peek for fans of the original, and there's interesting stuff going on with the elements the filmmakers choose to follow, but unfortunately it never all clicks together in the right way. S. DARKO picks up with Samantha Darko, Donnie's now teenaged little sister (once again played by Daveigh Chase), in the midst of a road trip with best friend Corey (Briana Evigan). A scrolling text at the beginning tells us of Samantha's disconnection from her family and inability to dream ever since her brother's death, so when we see her wandering the beautiful desert scenery of Utah in the opening scenes, a melancholy-princess personality has already been established for her. Their car breaks down in a little town called Conejo Springs, where the two girls are thrust into an odd series of events. The film, scripted by Nathan Atkins, switches up the main archetypes and protagonists from Kelly's feature, following the ""manipulated dead"" rather than the ""living receiver."" In this case, the receiver or ""Donnie"" of the film is a character known as Iraq Jack (James Lafferty). If you're unfamiliar with Kelly's terminology, the manipulated dead would be Frank the Bunny in the first film, someone whose future deceased self communicates with the receiver, prompting them to follow the destiny set forth for them. S. DARKO is set in 1995, and Jack is a Gulf War soldier who has been cast off by his fellow townspeople and ignored as a crazy young veteran with post-traumatic stress. Jack hangs around the town in cavelike hideouts and junkyards, rambling about things no one understands. As we quickly find out, Samantha is the manipulated dead, which explains why she cannot dream; she's too busy heading out and about in an extravagant dress and a creepy ghostlike form, speaking with Jack and preventing him from being crushed by a giant meteorite, much in the way Frank prevented Donnie's death by airplane engine. The town is populated with a multitude of characters, many of whom mirror personalities from DONNIE. There's the reformed criminal John (Matthew Davis), who has turned to Jesus and works as a pastor in the community but may still have a darker side. Elizabeth Berkley plays Trudy, John's extremely faithful and slightly unnerving sidekick. GOSSIP GIRL's Ed Westwick looks very James Dean as Randy, the town heartthrob who has lost a brother to a mysterious kidnapper plaguing the area (whom many of the locals suspect Iraq Jack of being). Finally, there's Jeremy (Jackson Rathbone), a sweet, nerdy guy who becomes enamored of the crashed meteorite and sees it transforming him out of his introverted ways. Perhaps, in this universe, there's a whole host of living receivers and certain things that link them--for instance, an artifact from a tangent universe coming to kill (or almost kill) them. But that train of thought leads to another problematic issue with S. DARKO: It didn't necessarily have to stick with its titular family. A more interesting way to go might have been to follow a new, random living receiver and manipulated dead. It's almost harder to believe this would all happen again to such a close relative (unless it's hereditary, but Samantha doesn't follow the same trajectory as Donnie--Jack does). This issue is exponentially magnified when it's revealed that Iraq Jack's real name is Justin Sparrow, making him the grandson of DONNIE's Roberta Sparrow. The coincidental nature of these and other occurrences in S. DARKO make the script by Atkins (a self-professed DONNIE devotee) feel like a sort of big-budget fan fiction. Then there's the film's midsection, an interesting experiment but one that ultimately doesn't work, and just goes off on a ""what if"" tangent (both literally and figuratively, since we're dealing with alternate universes here). Without giving too much away, it involves the transfer of the movie's focus from one character to another, revealing that this person too has the abilities of a limited receiver. It's an ambitious effort to upend expectations--but why is everyone in such a small group in possession of these extraordinary gifts? Perhaps the powers that be need to grant them to others to get everyone back to the path they're supposed to be on--a ""you play your role when it becomes necessary"" kind of thing. S. DARKO makes a point of not answering any questions that Kelly didn't, but adding such fresh twists makes the new film too convoluted. In the end, S. DARKO's creators made the wrong choices regarding where to be similar and where to differentiate themselves. The focus should probably have been on Iraq Jack, a more interesting character than Samantha, who doesn't truly recognize her role in the goings-on. Fisher and Atkins even seem to recognize this when, on the commentary, they speak about how passive a lead Samantha is, and Fisher expresses the desire to be able to go back and remake his own work. That's not to say the duo don't enjoy their film; their discussion imparts plenty of information and explanation about the process of making S. DARKO, and the two are clearly proud of what they have created.",1242172800,3,5601,4.978655282817503
3777555,1,B001RP975Q,"I, like many other avid Donnie Darko fans, was 80% angry to hear this movie was coming out...but at the same time, 20% excited at the possibility as well. I couldn't help thinking they would soil the premise and ideas behind Donnie Darko--try to change the artistic brilliance of the original into a formula.

But, I rented it anyways and wanted to actually give it a chance without being TOO pre-judgmental.

Sadly, it turns out I was right to pre-judge, I thought thy were going to try to capitalize on what made DD so unique, and I was SO VERY right. From the opening shot of a skyline, you can feel the blatant mockery and lack of any original direction or cinematography.

But still, I kept on watching--and I kept on being disappointed. All of the actors were stiff, including Samantha (Donnie's little sister), and the friend she was traveling with was extremely annoying to look at and listen to.

There was no plot really, no storyline--not even a general direction outside of a failure to mimic the orginal's. It was more like they literally went out of their was to mock DD instead of pay homage to it in a continuation/sequel. They amplified everything surreal about DD by 100% and dumbed it all down--somehow making the movie far more incoherent than DD was. I agree with the other reviewer who said Samantha just wandered aimlessly through the movie for the most part--and her character as well as the rest of the movie was terribly written. And I also agree with that reviewer when he said the prop guys need to be fired.

However, I made it a little over half-way through the movie and had to turn it off. I was just too horrible. Even as a stand-alone movie, if it weren't affiliated with Richard Kelly's masterpiece whatsoever, it would still be an awfully dreadful excuse for a smart, surreal film. I believe the only way the movie could've been worse is if Steven Seagal had been in it as the Manipulated Dead...but at least that would've been comical.

I think they just tried far too hard to recreate the magic of Donnie Darko, and ended up slaughtering the premise instead. I personally hope that the director of this wasn't a fan of the original, because if he was--he should be very ashamed of himself. And even though I'm sure she just needed the money, Daveigh Chase should also be ashamed of herself for partaking in this.

3777557,1,B001RP975Q,"I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. Even if the director really enjoyed Donnie Darko, he failed to recreate the magic of the first film, because he basically just copied most of the rules of the original movie's universe and tossed them into another (less interesting) story with little to no explanation as to why or how it happens, making this film basically Donnie Darko minus most of the actual theory and philosophy.

The basic upshot is that all the stuff that happened in Donnie Darko is still happening, but now his little sister and a bunch of people in some other town are involved. That's it. Samantha Darko's part is poorly written, too. She just seems to float along with whatever's going on, wandering around the town for seemingly no reason other than to run into all the characters. Is this supposed to be like a video game or something?

The movie also repeats the theme of Donnie Darko's sacrifice all of 3 times, with 3 different characters, and serves only to cheapen Donnie's role. As for the supporting cast, most of the characters are either obvious parallels of characters from the original film, or are completely superfluous.

As if that weren't enough of a slap in the face, the screenplay is slow paced and at times pretty aimless, there are too many pointless time-lapse footage sequences that contain no plot development, the music choices range from merely ok to downright awful, and at the end of the film, one guy is dead, and no one has learned anything, including the viewer. The moments of realization between characters after the time sequences that would have tied the events in this movie together are just not there. You can tell they were supposed to be, but it's like they just didn't get how to portray that.

They could almost improve this film by taking out all the filler scenes and blowing away the entire soundtrack (except for the song that was used in the movie trailer)

On a positive note, the role of Iraq Jack was well played. His death sequence was the only part of the movie that captured any of what Donnie Darko was about. Also Daviegh Chase did a pretty good job of portraying her poorly written character.

But I can't recommend S. Darko at all. She isn't a compelling character, and this isn't a compelling story. There was no reason to make this movie. There are worse things you could watch, but there is also Donnie Darko that you could just watch again and have a better time.

Funny side note: One of the tag suggestions for this movie on the review submittal page is ""fail"".",1242086400,4,2548,4.623893805309734
3777558,3,B001RP975Q,"Content reviews on a film like this can be very subjective, especially for the followers of the original film. Best summation I could come up with was the cast said in interviews: ""...this is a continuation, not a sequel..""

The story follows Samantha Darko seven years later as she sojourns across the Country lost in a haze. She breaks down in a small Utah town with her friend - and then the rest just gets ridiculous. The whole prop department needs to be fired. It is ""June/July 1995"", but the vehicles, fire engines, signage, and other assorted materials are way off. For instance, one central part of the film was the theater showing 12 Monkeys, I doubt some small town in Utah got the film the year before it premiered nationwide. I know, a time travel film - anything is possible. The majority of the story is a train wreck of bad acting and irritating characters. Mostly a 2 star film - but the Blu quality is superb.

The picture is extremely clear throughout and the special effects looked professional and thorough. The camera work, slow motion shots, and rapid forward clips all looked well preserved. The destiny/Abyss snake-looking things all looked crisp and the indoor shots did not show any grain. The DTS gets quite a workout with the music, and assorted montages of that garbles voice and dimensional stuff.

The special features give this another star (half). It will probably help satisfy the curious minded regarding the whole what-were-they-thinking. The main documentary lasts 15 minutes and covers the usual interviews, rife with plenty of quotes about why there was a ""continuation"" not a sequel. There is also a 6:45 minute clip about some of the cast making a music video and talking about the uniqueness of Utah. There are 6 minutes of deleted scenes - glad they were cut, they were worse than the movie itself (more of the God will save you mess from the film).

I have enjoyed the original film for years and it still rents very well, but this is one of those films that moves off the shelf for curiosity sake, and for some nice Blu quality, but not for the story or acting.",1242000000,20,2107,4.671159029649596
3777559,4,B001RP975Q,"Firstly, let me be blunt and admit up front that this film is really only a three star flick,I REPEAT ONLY A *** STAR FLICK, two and a half at the least, but there are already too many fan-boy rants, not reviews, about the movie sucking without ever having viewed it.  You know fan-boys, right?  Well, in case you don't, they're the same narrow minded losers who complained about the Transformers film not sticking closely enough to the original 80's cartoon's storyline.  Yeah, the same boring cartoon that was made after a successful line of action figures, essentially to be a further adverstisement for said action figures.  That film was as good as any whose main premise has to do with a bunch of over grown action figures from the Reagan era duking it out with things blowing up real good.  Don't even get me started on the Speed Racer dweebs.

Okay, sorry about the rant folks.

Going into this film's plot is futile.  Just like Donnie Darko the plot is dense and uneasily consumed in the first viewing.  Without spoiling the film too much, I can tell you that the movie comes from and explores the perspective of a character whose role is that of the manipulated dead as opposed to the first film's living receiver.  If you know your Donnie Darko mythology that little bit of info will help you swallow the film with a little more ease.  Sam Darko is similar to Donnie in that she is an outcast and morose.  She's running from her past and it leads her to a town in the middle of nowhere that might as well be hell.  She meets a man by the name of Iraq Jack, who has the same role in diverting a major dimensional disaster that her brother did in the previous film.  That's about as much of a plot description as I can give.

THE GOOD:  The acting is all wonderful.  The character of Sam Darko is more passive then her brother Donnie so she may come off as more of a victim, but her ultimate role in thee story requires all this once  all is said and done.  The cinematography, using the digital Red Camera, is perfect and filled with gorgeous vistas that even Ang Lee would envy.  The story supplies a switch of focus more traditional to the first film half way through and its really unexpected and interesting.  Whats really neat about he film is that it really expands the set mythology and explores things left out on the sidelines, like what exactly is the manipulated dead doing or going through while the living receiver is doing his duty?  The soundtrack, like the original, is AWESOME!  It's filled with obscure or minor hits from 1995(The Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance), so don't expect the radio rotated hits that the original had from 80's, but they're all great tunes and brought me back to middle school days.  Lastly, and most importantly, its a sequel that expadns some of the mythology set forth in the original but doesn't change or alter the final conclusions of the first film.  Donnie Darko isn't cheapened and none of its final impact derided. Another real cool change, in keeping with the perspective switch, is that instead of seeing the universe thorugh the genre of a super hero/sci-fi view we get a more feminine perspective, a fairy tale.  Some of the first few images drive this point home.

THE NOT SO GOOD:  As is the case with most sequels some of the romance and surprise is removed.  The film is smart for just changing the perspective, but at the same time we've vistied this universe already and nothing can change that.  We don't get enough time insid Iraq Jack's head, and since he's so very important to the film's final conslusion this is a real problem.  The director cribs or tries to pay homage to some imagery in Richard Kelly's original and they just come off hollow this time around.  The first film's conclusion tightly wrapped everything up, but this one seems to purposely leave some loose ends, maybe for a further installment?  Finally, my biggest gripe with this flick has to do with the impending doom itself.  The original had a very interesting, weird X-Files like disaster involving the plane engine, that was creepy and very visual, but this film's doomsday is so abstract it just doesn't leave enough of an impact on the visual level.  It's a cool concept especially if you've read Carl Sagan, but its abstract nature just doesn't have the real and relatable visual oomph of the plane engine from the original.

Well, there it is.  You really need to have seen and understood the first film to get into this one, but it doesn't rely too much on the first movie for its main story, just some of its concepts and overall mythology.  So check it out, it's not great or brilliant but it is truly entertaining and it moves at a fast clip.  It doesn't screw with the rules set by the first.  So, if you're not a finatical, basement dwelling fanboy at least rent it.  If you're a fanboy-nazi, then why would you bother seeing it or even reading this review.  Now go back to your blog....somewhere else.

The film stays true to its title, A Donnie Darko Tale.  Unlike most sequels, it takes place in the same universe(universes?) but doesn't change what went before it.  Besides, the original was so comic book centric, why wouldn't a sequel be warranted?  Comics have way too many sequels, spin offs, and even alterante realities(DC's Earth II) to take place in.",1241740800,74,5323,4.579281183932347
