8479807,5,B005MUOYY6,"This excellent German film from 2009 was better than I had expected. Ken Duken plays the role of introvert Daniel Bauer who works as a gardener in the botanical gardens in Berlin. The film uses hardly any incidental music and the vast majority of scenes follow Daniel on his reign of terror which keeps on being interrupted by the initially unwanted attentions of his female coworker Jana (Franziska Weisz). This chilling study of a serial killer is also combined with a story of damaged love.
The film is in German and subtitled in English throughout, although there is far less dialogue than many other films available.
Hopefully there are more decnet films starring Ken Duken available, he's certainly impressed me in this performance.",1333324800,,738,5.008130081300813
