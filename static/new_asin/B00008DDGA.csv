7981937,5,B00008DDGA,"I got this in a grab bag of fitness videos and equipment.  It was the lone VHS tape among a bunch of Pilates DVD's, and seemed like an odd companion to them.  Anyway, on the request of my mum, I'm watching this one to see if she'd like it, and it looks like a lot of fun.  A lot more fun than one of the DVD's I just stumbled through.

Richard Simmons enthusiastically leads a group of seniors through an energetic but gentle workout.  It's mostly foot shuffling and hand waving, easy to follow, and should be enough to raise your pulse rate if you're not an especially active person.  The participants show a variety of body shapes and sizes, are dressed in layers, not spandex, and seem to be having a good time.  There's also a small live band who sometimes dance along.

This isn't going to be enough of a workout for a lot of people, but it should work for a group, for someone getting back to exercise, or someone who doesn't want to feel intimidated by an exercise video.  Just don't be put off by the 'for seniors' theme.",1187913600,17,1029,4.290155440414508
7981938,5,B00008DDGA,"I really like this video. It is a good aerobics video for older adults or those just starting to exercise. Richard Simmons makes the workout fun as in all his videos, but what I especially like about this video is it is only 25 minutes long.",1122422400,26,241,4.260869565217392
