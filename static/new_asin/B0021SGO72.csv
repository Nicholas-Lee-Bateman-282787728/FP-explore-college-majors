8349418,5,B0021SGO72,"Ever since I saw this on the History Channel, I waited for the dvd to come out.  This is one of those stories that every American should know.  We tend to think that all those who fought in our wars were known, appreciated, and missed when gone.  But the fact is that during the Revolutionary War many of those who fought for us (both men and women) were unknown.  They were often outcasts from their families who were still loyal to the British, or they were alone in the world with only their dreams to carry them through.  They fought because they had a dream for future generations to enjoy the liberty and opportunities they believed in.  When they died, their names were lost and never spoken again.

This is the story of some of those young men and women we will never know, but owe all to.  If it had not been for the few who survived to tell the story, all we would know is that the New York harbors are full of the bones of those who died there.  Estimates have placed American Revolution POW deaths at approx. 11,500 people; far more than deaths on the battlefields.  And most of those deaths were in New York City on the British prison ships.

POWs were kept on abandoned British ships in New York harbors where they were abused and starved until they died.  No assistance was given to them, and no one really cared that they were there.  The American government (what there was of it) ignored them, the military ignored them, the churches ignored them.  Once they were prisoners, they were considered dead already because there was no method of prisoner exchange or humane systems to call upon.  Since it was a rebellion and not a war, they were not classified as POWs.  The Patriots had no knowledge of what was going on outside, or how the war was going, so the fact that they remained loyal to the cause of Liberty should always be honored.  What would have happened to the cause of Liberty had this many turned against it and opted to receive a pardon by joining the British Army or Navy in order to save their own lives?

This story needs to be seen.

And the next time you see a photo of a military cemetery or a local cemetery with the little flags and markers to commemorate one of our veterans, remember that there are thousands of Patriot heroes without a gravesite or a commemoration right here in our own country.  We stand on hallowed ground.",1355788800,2,2368,4.424942263279446
