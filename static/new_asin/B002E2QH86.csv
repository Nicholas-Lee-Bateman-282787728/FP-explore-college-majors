If you've seen enough of the Italian Giallo/horror films then your expectations are right where they need to be and
there is no disappointment. This film is 1/4 of the Brivido Giallo Collection, an Italian cable TV series.
The film was used because it did not have enough substance for a feature film, but Bava thought it perfect for TV.",1489449600,,452,4.592592592592593

8366708,4,B002E2QH86,"A simple murder plot gets a first class upgrade in this excellent release from Mya Communication.  Director Lamberto Bava and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti made a series of films for an Italian television series 'BRIVIDO GIALLO' and although this entry is without supernatural elements, it has more jolts and scares than the best of them. It also gives a new meaning to the saying 'Till Death To Us Part', the Italian title was 'PER SEMPRE' which is engraved in the wedding rings shown throughout the film.  Beginning with a brutal murder of a cuckold husband, the story advances eight years later as our now loving couple have inherited a bed and breakfast and the dead mans eight year old son.  Enter a mysterious stranger who seems to know bits and pieces of the cover up and you have a pressure cooker of a story boiling better than a pot of pasta.  Gioia Scola steals the show as the wife who wants to atone for her crime. David Brandon ,whom you'll recognize from Michele Soavi's excellent thriller 'STAGE FRIGHT' plays the new husband with fidgety aplomb and the underrated Urbano Barberini who was so excellent in Dario Argento's classic terror fest 'OPERA' rounds out the mix. Bava directs with his usual visual style utilizing touches from his father Mario but calling the genre his own and never goes over the top making this the  best of his television forays. The soundtrack is by Simon Boswell who also wrote the scores for the other entries.  The DVD can be viewed in either English or Italian , the english soundtrack has some noisy clicks and pops so the Italian fares much better, however, there are no subtitles.  The quality is crisp and clear making this Mya release highly recommended for fans of Italian Horror and for some who just like a good mystery.",1285891200,2,1777,4.731391585760518
8366709,4,B002E2QH86,"Anyone who's watched enough Lamberto Bava movies knows that some of his best are actually gore-free.  Take Macabre, or in this instance, Until Death.  (For an Italian made-for-TV movie) It has great acting,some surprisingly competent writing, and another great score by Simon Boswell.  There are moments of genuine tension and anxiety (though these are often diluted by some not-so-effective scare scenes) Once again, it's no Demons (or Demons 2!), but it does stand on it's own, especially when compared to the campy Dinner with a Vampire or the kiddie-horror awfulness of Graveyard Disturbance (though I must admit they ARE guilty pleasures....)",1257552000,7,647,5.3861386138613865
