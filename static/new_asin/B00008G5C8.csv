1844308,3,B00008G5C8,"Disclaimer: The version of the film that I watched was included in a compilation package called 'Horror - Do Not Watch Alone 15 films' by TGG Direct.  (This is nearly the same edition as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-Do-Not-Watch-Alone-20-Classic-Horror-Films/dp/B002A7LEN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror - Do Not Watch Alone (20 Classic Horror Films)</a>&nbsp;by the same company.)  As such, I cannot comment on the quality of this product - my review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

There are several elements of this 1973 film that work well and should appeal to viewers with different tastes; however, taken together, I suspect that these elements don't always compliment each other.  Those who might appreciate some aspects may not care for others, which makes the film weaker as a whole.  Unfortunately, the way that this film is marketed (in individual packages as well as compilations such as the one I have), it is very likely to turn off those who might enjoy it most, and mislead those who would probably like it least into buying it.  You must stretch the definition to its very breaking point in order to call this a horror movie - it barely even works as a thriller.  More than anything, it is a police procedural, with Christopher Plummer's detective investigating the death of a heroin-addicted call girl played by Karen Black.

One of the benefits of these compilation discs is that I usually have little idea of what the movie is going to be about before I watch - it takes me be surprise, so to speak.  Without any expectations, I enjoyed 'The Pyx', even as I could see its weaknesses.  In a very excellent opening, the credits appear over scenes shot from the interior of a Montreal cabdriver looking out at the city.  At the end of the credits, in the corner of the camera lens almost off screen, we see a body falling from one of the downtown high-rises.  This is so underplayed as to almost be shocking.  Regardless, the police are quickly called, and thus begins the investigation.  As the film continues, we are treated to flashbacks from the point of view of the victim Karen Black interspersed with the investigation into her death.

The film is atmospheric and slow.  Director Harvey Hart seems to be going for an accumulated creepiness, though I think the flashback segments interrupt the narrative flow too much to ever establish that kind of mood.  What's left is the mystery of exactly what happened to Karen Black's character in her last few hours, although since we do know the eventual results, it does seem a bit academic.  Since every other official blurb for this film lets on that there is involvement with a devil cult, it seems like no spoiler to mention it here, though that _is_  the crux of the mystery.  Except there is no overt supernatural element -- and using that particular element to make it sound like a horror film is likely to only disappoint people.

With no expectations, and with an attitude that is generally favorable toward 70's cinema (at least to the point of being indulgent toward its many faults), I admit I rather liked this film.  Christopher Plummer, Karen Black, and the supporting cast were all in top form here, and even though the film took its time, I never got bored with it.  Those who detest slow, mood-building films should probably avoid 'The Pyx', as well as those who have an inherent dislike toward older films, though patient mystery fans should enjoy it.

Of course, there were some points that detracted from it too -- the most, to my mind, was the ending, where the flashbacks met up with the starting point of the story.  So much time had been invested to get us to that point that the payoff seemed rushed and unsatisfactory.  Also, the choice of having Ms. Black sing on the soundtrack will appeal to some and not others -- I personally like the songs, but the style dates the film.  All together, the positives outweigh the negatives, but only by a slim margin.  3 1/2 stars.

From other reviewers and studio information provided by Amazon, its very difficult to tell if _any_ of the current packages of this film are worth investing in.  The version I watched was satisfactory for the price I paid (about 50 after averaging), though it had several defects - most notably it was very dark.  I also watched it on a smaller screen, and I would imagine large, hi-def screens will augment other problems.  Those interested in the film may want to wait until a quality imprint releases it, or resign themselves to the defects on the lower-priced horror collections that currently offer it.",1303171200,,4657,4.878017789072427

1844310,1,B00008G5C8,"The Pyx (Harvey Hart, 1973)

While Harvey Hart did make roughly a dozen forays into big-screen directing, he mainly worked in television, directing episodes of such classic shows as Ben Casey, Star Trek, and Mannix, as well as a number of TV movies (many of the movie-length Columbo episodes of the seventies are Hart's work). Like many TV directors who try their hand at the big screen, Hart suffers from a compulsion to make sure space exists for commercial breaks, resulting in movies that are, at best, episodic; even when there is no deodorant commercial, we, as a nation of TV viewers, know that when you get a fade to black every ten minutes, one should be there. Suspension of disbelief becomes stretched to the breaking point, if not downright impossible. Sadly, The Pyx suffers a great deal from this conceit. That is not to say, of course, it is the movie's only shortcoming.

The Pyx offers us Elizabeth Lucy (Karen Black), who, in the film's opening sequence, plummets to her death from a twenty-story building. This makes it somewhat surprising when we see her in bed with someone a few minutes later. (Not that anyone's going to complain a great deal about seeing Karen Black in the altogether, I'm sure.) Eventually, you will realize that we're getting two timelines-- the days following Lucy's death, as detectives Jim Henderson (Christopher Plummer, in the nadir of his long and distinguished career) and Pierre Paquette (The Uncanny hunk Daniel Pilon) investigate, and the days leading up to her death, as we see the events from her perspective. Neither, unfortunately, is terribly interesting.

Much of the time it seemed as if Hart wasn't sure whether he wanted to make a straight murder mystery, a supernatural horror film, or a disease-of-the-week style movie about heroin. Whether this is Hart's problem or that of the John Buell novel on which the screenplay is based, I don't know; I haven't been able to figure out which of Buell's novels the movie is based on. (He did not, that I can find, write one with this name.) In the end, though, Hart tries to merge all three, and the result is an unmitigated mess. Elizabeth Lucy is supposed to be a high-priced call girl, but she acts more like a shy teenager half the time; you'd think someone working for the city's top madam would have a bit more experience. The madam herself is a complete mystery, an entirely inconsistent character. The detectives are about as smart of boxes of rocks. Etc.

I was given this one as a Christmas gift a while back, part of an entire boxful of DVDs that, I believe, cost the giver about five bucks total; I'd say they paid about what the movie was worth, given that each film would then cost about a dime. Worth a rental if you're planning a bad movie night, but otherwise, avoid it like the plague. *",1212105600,2,2810,4.705284552845528
1844311,4,B00008G5C8,"I've loved Karen Black ever since I sat rivetted by her performance in TRILOGY OF TERROR, back about a million years ago. THE PYX has Ms. Black as Elizabeth Lucy, a heroin-addicted prostitute, just trying to get by. Unfortunately, she gets drawn into a horrific situation, resulting in her demise. The movie opens at the point of her death. Christopher Plummer (Dolores Claborne) is a cop named Henderson who tries to unravel the mystery surrounding Elizabeth's homicide. We are taken along as things grow increasingly uneasy and disturbing. Henderson himself must come face to face w/ evil, and forces he cannot understand.

1844312,2,B00008G5C8,"Why does this exist?

I'll tell you.

It exists as a Canadian take on the huge hit, ""Klute"", which starred Donald Sutherland and Jane Fonda.

That flick was bad enough. This one tells you where it's headed right off the bat with a screechy, decades out-of-fashion, theme song sung by the star, Karen Black against someone providing acoustic guitar.

She does 3 different soundtrack numbers in this film, one worse than the next.

Christopher Plummer, supposedly a world-weary, jaded police detective (we know this because the villain tells us so at the end of the movie. Otherwise, I wouldn't have had a clue), sleepwalks throughout.

He has very little actual dialogue. Very few of the actors have anything meaningful to say and yet, the film feels talky.

It drags and drags and drags.

Director Harvey Hart switches the timeline back and forth with abandon. No devices are used to let you know you're either in the past or in the future. One second someone is dead, the next, they're in a bar having a drink. This was, I suppose, made like that to be suspenseful, but the pacing just wore me out.

And I must say, the ""Carefully Re-Mastered For Best Possible Picture Quality"" claim on the back of the case, is a bunch of crap, too.

I have no idea what this looked like in the theater on opening day, but the dark, grainy, choppily edited, murky mess St. Clair Vision has produced here, has not been touched by a living soul.

It is quite obviously a sloppy dub from an old public domain VHS tape. Shame on them, even at the cheap price they're charging.

It's possible that this would have been a completely different experience if I'd actually seen a watchable print. Nothing can help the sluggish, silly script, dull acting and anti-climactic ending, though.

Junk is junk.

Watch it only if you're interested in movies from the 70's on an anthropological level, because as entertainment, this clearly misses the mark.",1180310400,,1924,4.721556886227545
1844313,5,B00008G5C8,"I must disagree with the prior review; I saw the film theatrically in 1973 when it first opened theatrically and was a bit put off; then I saw it again about a year later and saw plot points I had missed the first time and found the film to actually be quite intricate with fascinating characters.  Karen Black turns in one of her best performances as Elizabeth Lucy, the heroin-addicted prostitute (and she also wrote and performs several effective songs on the soundtrack).  Far more intellectual and riveting than many ""thrillers"", I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes intelligent screenplays and also a film that makes them think a bit.

1844314,1,B00008G5C8,"What were Karen Black and Christopher Plummer thinking when they agreed to star in this movie?  Obviously they needed jobs, as this dull and muddled film lacks any true artistic merit.  While director Harvey Hart tried to be original in his dual flashback style, it doesn't help when the script overloads itself with confusion and awful dialogue.  The movie opens with Karen Black hurtling from a high apartment building, and Plummer is the detective out to solve the death.  Black was a prostitute, and somehow gets mixed up with a wealthy patron, who obviously has more than sex on his mind.  That's about it..and the climax which reveals the reason behind Black's death is as muddled as the rest of the film.  Not recommended.",1137369600,2,729,4.838709677419355

Filmed in Montreal, it stars Christopher Plummer as a detective discovering an elusive satanic cult while investigating the suspicious death of a beautiful prostitute. Based on the novel of the same name by John Buell, the film is a well edited adaptation by director Harvey Hart. Not too many films have dealt too seriously with the uccult, asside from the EXORCIST and THE WICKER MAN, to which this film can take its place allongside.

1844316,3,B00008G5C8,"A prostitute (Karen Black) dies after falling off a tall building and a Montreal policeman (Christopher Plummer) investigates what he believes is a murder.

  HOOKER CULT MURDERS is a little more substantial than its title would lead one to believe.  It begins with Black's character's death and follows to different threads - the story of the hooker leading up to her death and the story of the police investigation.  So Black and Plummer never share a scene, but both are pretty good - Black as a drugged out prostitute dragged into something beyond her understanding, Plummer as an obsessed investigator.  The movie was filmed in Montreal, and it has a nice naturalistic feel to it.

  Still it's pretty long and winding, and interest flags sooner than the explanatory scenes at the end which tie up the mysteries.  In fact, I thought the ending was kind of silly.  The transfer print was in okay to good condition, watchable but not something you're going to savor.

  An okay cappuccino movie (a cappuccino movie being one that costs less than a cup of gourmet coffee.)  Recommended without reservations for Karen Black and/or Christopher Plummer fans.",1110067200,2,1157,4.953125
1844317,1,B00008G5C8,"This DVD is of a little-known film made in Montreal in the early 1970s, starring a very young and beautiful Karen Black, Christopher Plummer and Quebec actor Donald Pilon. This film was often shown on TV in Canada throughout the 70s, and although I cannot call it a great movie, it does have a certain atmospheric quality to it which has stuck in my mind all these years.
This movie is one of a host of films that came out at around this time (see also: ""The Devil's Rain"", ""Race With the Devil"", ""The Omen"", ""The Sentinel"", etc.) which, influenced by the success of such films as Rosemary's Baby and especially The Exorcist, dealt with the theme of Satanism.
Police detective Plummer and his partner Pilon are called to the murder case of prostitute Black. We flash back to Black's final days, as clues gradually lead the detectives to a Satanic cult.
Plummer is good as the detective but the real star here is Black, who has never been more radiant, and who also sings the movie's hauntingly etherial theme song.
It's a pity that the DVD transfer of this film is so bad, because I really do like this film and would otherwise have given it 3 stars.
But unfortunately the money-grubbing DVD-making people at Beverly Wilshire were so cheap they did not even bother to do what most el-cheapo DVD release companies do when releasing a movie with a picture screen ratio wider than a conventional TV screen, which is to pan and scan. Instead, they merely went and squeezed the entire wider image into the smaller screen, thus giving us a movie of long, thin ""stick people"". Such lazyness is absolutely INEXCUSABLE, and I wish there were some way to punish these people who are obviously out to cheat the unsuspecting public.
I guess the only real method to punish them we have at our disposal is to withhold our hard-earned money, so I would strongly advise you NOT to buy this DVD.
--Which is a real pity, because this film does deserve to be seen, and if you've viewed and enjoyed the other films I've mentioned above, chances are you will probably like this one too. I can only hope that someone will someday rerelease this again in a proper DVD version, giving the film the respect it deserves. In the meantime, this film was also previously released on video, so if you scrounge around you may be able to find yourself a copy. This is what I will now have to do.",1078444800,34,2363,4.5362997658079625

1844387,3,B00008G5C8,"Ah, Canadian suspense/horror! This film is almost completely forgotten and unknown, and it certainly isn't an undiscovered classic, but it does have many good points. Young Christopher Plummer is hot and bilingual, and younger Karen Black looks pretty lush and less cross-eyed than usual. This was shot in Montreal and actually intended to be Montreal, so there's some Quebecois French in there to make this a little more interesting than your average film. The story is told non-linearly, alternating between her storyline leading up to her tragic end (not a spoiler) and Plummer, the cop investigating her death. The whole Satanic cult angle is a plus if you're a fan of that kind of horror, and while this is no Rosemary's Baby it does keep you interested. If you're going through a Canadian horror checklist, you've got to check this one out (though be advised, it's a lot more suspense thriller than pure horror, and it's not gory).",1405987200,,937,4.936708860759493
1844388,3,B00008G5C8,"I came here to comment on the Trinity Home Entertainment DVD and not so much the film.  I was pleased that the film is presented in what looks like its original aspect ration of 2.35 : 1 and it's formatted for 16:9, but the image is dirty and dark.  I'm OK with filthy prints, especially with films like this where it sometimes adds to the experience, but the image is often so dark it's difficult to see everything as it was intended. The end credits are almost completely illegible.  The disc does not include any extras, not even a trailer.

As for the movie, it's not that bad.  Some will find it a little slow and it might take some time to get used to the mixing of the flashbacks of Elizabeth's (Karen Black) last day with Detective Henderson's (Christopher Plummer) investigation of her death.  The performances are quite good and the music score and songs (sung by Black) work very well, too.  Perhaps with a better print I might have enjoyed the film more.

The detective realizes that she was the victim of a satanic cult. This is a very suspenseful and incredibly well acted and directed film. This has plot and character and not blood, gore and monsters. There is in fact very little horror in the film. It could pass as a detective murder thriller except at the end. In the confrontation between the detective and the head of the cult, the head of the cult tells the detective several things, such as what the detective was thinking when his wife was killed in an accident, that he could only have learned from a supernatural source.  Karen Black's character, a wayward Catholic, redeems herself towards the end. By current standards it might be considered slow but I found it very involving.

1844391,4,B00008G5C8,"The review is for Katarina's Nightmare Theater release of the PYX. I have been curious about this film for decades & I am glad I finally picked it up.
The Pyx is based on the novel written by John Buell, I grew up in Montreal and attended elementary school with his young son. So, I knew about the book first, then years later I learned it was made into a film. This is a Canadian production & it's an early example of Canadian Exploitation Cinema, during this period several productions were being made in Canada featuring American directors & actors. Canadian film making was in it's infancy & the producers probably had their eye on making a dent in an American market. The Pyx also serves as a bit of a time capsule, as you get to see how Montreal looked back in the early 70's. Christopher Plummer plays a cop who is investigating the murder of prostitute, Karen Black. Plummer finds evidence of a devil cult, drugs, & the church being involved during her final hours. The storytelling style is interesting - from Karen's perspective it unfolds through a series of flashbacks leading up to the final days just before her death. It's a suspense thriller with supernatural elements. The version presented here is taken from the original film negative & it also features commentary with Karen Black & the original trailer. You can watch the movie with the intoduction from horror hostess Katarina, or just play the feature film. The Pyx is also known as ""The Hooker Cult Murders"", but this particular version is 2:35:1 widescreen, it has the best quality. This is the one to get if you are interested. If you like this movie, another Canadian production worth checking out is The Silent Partner which was shot in Toronto just a few years later, it stars Elliot Gould, Susannah York, Christopher Plummer & a very young John Candy.",1348012800,13,1831,4.6894409937888195
