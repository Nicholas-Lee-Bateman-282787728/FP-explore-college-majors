91251,4,0790732300,"Released in 1971 and directed by Don Siegel, ""Dirty Harry"" stars Clint Eastwood in the eponymous role as a no-nonsense San Francisco detective sick of the liberal constraints on cops and the corresponding pro-thug mentality. With a new partner (Reni Santoni) he seeks a mad murderer (Andrew Robinson) who takes advantage of the libertine protections of the system.

Im a fan of all five of the Dirty Harry films, which are as follows: ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), ""Magnum Force"" (1973), ""The Enforcer"" (1976), ""Sudden Impact"" (1983) and ""The Dead Pool"" (1988).

""Magnum Force"" is my favorite, a rare case where the sequel is superior to the original. The two films compliment each other well because their stories are sort of the inverse of the other. In this film Harry becomes a vigilante cop in order to take down a psycho thug, yet only to a point, whereas in Magnum Force he is forced to take down vigilante cops who have gone too far in their efforts to tackle rampant crime.  The latter represent Harry if he DIDNT pull in the reigns after this movie.

My second favorite is the nigh-surreal Sudden Impact while this one is my least preferred, although I still like it. I just think the stories in the four sequels have more drive. Dirty Harry seems languid and hollow by comparison. Moreover, the villain, Scorpio, is so annoying; and the way he gets away with his crimes via legal loopholes and the idiocy of the authorities and their pro-thug system is so aggravating (and, yes, I realize that was the point).

The cinematography is great with several high shots of the Bay area. Speaking of which, theres a pervading dead ambiance about the movie with its intermittent insights about the city, the sad hollowness thereof and the meaninglessness of life in general. Harry seems to say eff it, and gets his job done, with or without the sanction of his superiors.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, with studio work done in Burbank.  The screenplay was written by Harry Julian Fink & Rita M. Fink with the additions of several others (e.g. John Milius).

91267,5,0790732300,"This is a great action thriller.  It is the story of a police inspector who does not hesitate to resort to violence when violence appears to be called for.  It almost seems to me to be a ""Western"" set in modern times.  Clint Eastwood's character, Harry Callahan, then is a cowboy in modern society.  In my mind, I feel this is the role that most defines Clint Eastwood as an actor.

The movie is directed by Don Siegel.  Mr. Siegel also directed another of my favorite movies, ""The Shootist"".  Harry Callahan has a partner, Frank DiGiorgio, who is played by John Mitchum, the brother of Robert Mitchum.  Personally, I also enjoy the ""time capsule"" aspect of this movie.  It is from 1971, when I was a young adult.

As a retired police officer, this movie seems surreal to me.  In my experience, one only occasionally interacts with an individual who is completely, violently evil.  Therefore the instantaneous resort to violence is almost never justified.  An officer would spend so much time on restricted duty or administrative leave, that one would hardly have any time on ""the street"".  However, I enjoy the viewing experience very much and have watched this movie more than once.  Thank You.",1490313600,2,1196,4.765853658536585

91282,3,0790732300,I did not see this until later.  Probably sometime in the '80s.  I had actually seen some of the other Dirty Harry movies before this one.  This one is the first and it and Sudden Impact are my favorites.  This is probably the role that Clint Eastwood is remembered best for.  Or at least his best known none western role.  Since they made all the sequels I thought it would have been interesting to have Eastwood and Steve McQueen together as Dirty Harry and Bullitt since they both were on the San Francisco Police Department.  But I guess that was something that wasn't ment to be.,1487548800,,584,4.452830188679245

91284,4,0790732300,"Classic thriller.  Redneck cop goes up against liberal 1970s San Franciso political establishment while city is terrorized by a Zodiac-like serial killer.  Directed by the great Don Siegel, edgy and ingenious cinematography by Bruce Surtees, crisp editing by Ferris Webster, above-average score by Lalo Schifrin.  Even Eastwood gives a good performance, as do John Vernon, Andy Robinson, Harry Guardino and many others.  Riveting from beginning to end.  Only liability is that the story and many elements are copied without credit straight out of ""The Searchers"" -- Dirty Harry's character, his sidekick, Scorpio/Scar, the kidnapping of the girl, the structure of the overall saga.",1485561600,,681,5.572815533980583
91285,3,0790732300,"This movie is definitely watchable.  Fast paced.  The best part was seeing how San Francisco looked in the 70s and people with high hair cuts and typewriters.

91365,4,0790732300,"I worked in a gun store when the original Dirty Harry movie made it debut.  A couple of weeks after the movie's premiere, we couldn't keep S&W Model 29's in stock.  Eventually, S&W placed a monthly limit on the number of 29's they would allow to be distributed to any single gun store.  Some people were literally snapping-up as many .44 magnum revolvers as they could afford to buy -- apparently anticipating they would become highly prized collectables.  In addition, it got to the point where Smith &Wesson stopped accepting special orders for Model 29's.  Before Dirty Harry, the retail price of a Model 29 was around $249.00 +- and a typical gun store might have sold one or two every couple of months.  Within 6 months after the movie's release, 44 Mags. were flying off the shelves and gun dealers were fetching a premium price of $449.00 -- $500.00, which in today's dollars, is $2,663.00.  This buying frenzy went on hot and heavy for approximately 2 years, before the interest and the buying cooled down significantly.  As for the movie, it was such a new theme at the time, it garnered a ton of publicity and some people couldn't get enough of the movie -- or the revolver.",1466899200,,1184,4.631578947368421

91372,5,0790732300,"In 1971 - a time when trousers that cost $29.50 are considered pricey enough that, if you're shot in the leg, you'd rather painfully take them off than cut them off with scissors - some of the most frenzied water cooler talks must've revolved around DIRTY HARRY, a hard-hitting cop thriller that sparked controversy and caught on so well it spawned four sequels. Clint Eastwood was already big noise in cinema from his sagebrush colabs with Sergio Leone, but his role of ""Dirty Harry"" is what cemented his superstar status. Directed in no-nonsense fashion by Don Siegel, a master of the genre, DIRTY HARRY was more than just a cop film. It was a cultural and political snap shot of the 1970s, a contentious era haunted by the specter of the Vietnam War, blemished by urban decay, and that ushered in a more frank, more brazen public stance on sex and language and behavior. It's a damn good movie inhabited by an iconic vigilante figure that represented what must've been a popular mindset of a population fed up with all the guff and wishing desperately for someone to take action.

In San Francisco, maverick lawman, Inspector Harry Callahan, prefers to dole out swift justice with mean-spirited gamesmanship and his cannon-barreled .44 Magnum. But maybe he's met his match in the Scorpio Killer, a serial rooftop sniper who vows to kill a person a day unless he gets paid $100,000. Callahan is rarin' to explode into action, except he's reined in by his nervous superiors who'd rather engage in a spate of political shillyshallying. So what's a loose cannon to do? If you're Dirty Harry, you go munch on a hot dog, foil a bank robbery, and challenge a goon what's eyeing his gun lying inches away with your infamous ""Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?"" taunt.

I should credit Andy Robinson who plays the lone nut killer. He's creepy and unsettling. If I ever had any doubts as to whether Callahan's methods were too gung ho, they're put to rest when the killer begins to apply the legal system to squirm out of retribution. This guy's about as low as they come, the sort of scum who targets young girls swimming in pools and holds hostage children on a school bus. Eastwood is wonderful here. Note his cool exterior but also the seething undercurrent, a lone wolf plainsclothesman who's clearly just about had it up to here with Scorpio's mewling about his civil rights and with his bosses' weasely execution of civic administration. I love the juxtaposition of having ""Dirty"" Harry ply his frowned-on wares in the backdrop of a metropolis like the City by the Bay with its clean, photogenic skyline and its liberal outlook. When our man unleashes his brand of bottled-up violence, it's somehow more satisfying.",1465171200,,2718,4.768577494692145

91605,5,0790732300,"It's funny, but in the first few minutes, I actually thought, ""Clint Eastwood does a really good Jim Carrey doing a really good Clint Eastwood!""  But then I realized how wrong I was, because even though Jim Carrey is really funny, Clint Eastwood is even funnier.

Most people know the iconic lines from this film, although if you watch the film again -- as I just did in the last day -- you'll realize that the lines that are most ""remembered"" aren't remembered much at all; those lines are spoken somewhat differently.  But then again, whether Mr. Eastwood says ""punk"" at the beginning or ending of a sentence really doesn't matter anyways.  It's all in the delivery.

And the delivery is always spot-on with Mr. Eastwood, of course.

But I don't think that a film such as this could be made today, what with all of the ridiculous political correctness going on.  As the most popular review for this film discusses, this was made in a time where people were getting sick and tired of being mugged -- or worse -- and the police doing nothing.  So they wanted to take the law in their own hands and do something.  Of course, in reality, they lived life safely through Dirty Harry and let him do, well, the Dirty Work.  That way, they kept their hands clean.

But now, as America has moved decidedly Left, they don't care anymore really.  People don't care if people get mugged anymore, unless it happens to them.  But they are quick to judge others who don't take a liberal stand on justice, and in this sense, this is where America is probably failing.  When people don't care anymore is when a society begins to fail, and I think that you are seeing that firsthand nowadays.

Well, you can still watch ""Dirty Harry"" and get a laugh.  A really good laugh.  If you have a sense of humor, that is.  And while I enjoy watching Mr. Carrey do a spot-on imitation of Mr. Eastwood, after watching this film again after so many years, all I've got to say is:  I'll take Mr. Eastwood anytime.  After all, I'd rather hear it straight from the horse's mouth.",1425340800,,2047,4.495934959349594

91613,5,0790732300,"This film is the absolute matrix for a series of four more films with and by Clint Eastwood as well as a new way to deal with the problem of extreme crime and both the police answer and the political lack of courage in front of this emerging serial killing practice. We are in 1971 before the emergence of profiling that will come from the FBI in Quantico. So both police departments (led by elected sheriffs or marshals) and political personnel, like mayors and district attorneys, do not know what to do with such criminals and they tend to take a conservative stance hiding behind the very famous Miranda (the tree hiding the forest) and treating the crimes separately, hence erasing the serial dimension.

Clint Eastwood reacting along the same line as the general public considered that the police had to be a lot more responsive, hence active and even brutal with these criminals, to the point of shooting first without any warning and asking questions afterwards, and only if they did not have any bullets left in their weapons. Some yelled at abuse of power. Others applauded to support the use of force to protect innocent bystanders. We were in the post 1968 period, the post Woodstock period, and the post hippy period. That strong stance on Clint Eastwoods side was the backlash at excessive tolerance and liberalism that was shown for what it had become in films like Zabriskie Point or Fritz the Cat, a direct encouragement to criminal activities.

That feeling of fear in the wide public was also racially motivated for some white people because that was the time when the Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam started using the second amendment to justify their decision to carry weapons in public in full respect of what all whites could do. This feeling was amplified by the persistence of the Vietnam War and the very conservative policy of Richard Nixon. The number of casualties in Vietnam and the cost of the war, not to speak of the cost of the veterans who were lucky enough to come back in one piece though quite often severely impaired, becoming more and more visible and expensive, the people were quite ready to ask for a change in policy, a return of money in larger quantities to security within the country, which meant the end of the war. And yet it was still to go on for four years, increasing all the time the exasperation of the public.

This film is still slightly slow but it is stampeding away in 1971. That was an action film and it had to be fast, though it is here more endurance than speed, and yet many of the tricks that were to develop in the next decades were already there: short sequences edited in clean cut ellipses. The camera did not have any time and energy to waste to give small descriptive details but it emphasized the successive moments in the action, even at times in a nearly impossible sequence, like Inspector Harry climbing to the top of the high building from which the serial killer had shot his first victim in less time than it took the coroners team to wrap up the body of the victim and take it off the crime scene. Here the editing ellipse with Harry at the top point of the building and the body of the victim being removed makes it look extremely fast and meaningful.

But this film is the matrix for many films to come that expose the inability of elected personnel, on both the police side and the political side, and even the judicial side, to understand that some urgent revision of police procedures has to be worked out  out of a magicians hat if necessary  that would at the same time respect judicial and legal procedures, empower the police to respond to such criminals at top speed, and protect the public against such criminals who cannot be saved in anyway because they like  sorry some of them do love  killing. From this obvious point to the idea that they have to be killed on the spot while committing a crime there is only one small step that is often climbed or taken in the heat of action.

But we can be sure this film was the matrix of what was to become very popular detective  or rather nowadays police  series. Colombo is out and CSI or NCIS are in. And then you can work on details with Dexter or Criminal Minds and Bones. But it is always the same idea: these serial killers have to be neutralized at best  or worst  and eliminated from society at worst  or at best. For Inspector Harry the second option is the only one. Since then a lot of thinking has been done and particularly we have understood that such serial killers may be psychopaths or sociopaths, but they are necessarily super intelligent and they cannot be considered as intellectually underdeveloped, let alone handicapped or differently abled if you prefer.

Thats probably why Clint Eastwood will come back to that character four more times over the next seventeen years.

91617,5,0790732300,"This is arguably the best cop flick of all time.  ""Dirty Harry"" was a sensation when it hit the silver screen due to a stellar performance by Clint Eastwood and a superb supporting caste.  This is the film that really went after political correctness by exposing the difficulties faced by law enforcement in dealing with truly evil criminals.  It is not too much to say that Clint Eastwood was born to play the role of Detective Harry Callahan.  By the way, the villain in this flick is quite possibly the most hateful, despicable, and evil character ever to grace the silver screen.  Good luck finding some redeeming features of this miscreant.  There are none.

The commentary that this film makes on the Fourth and Fifth Amendments are controversial to this day.  At the very least this film deserves credit for helping to begin a public discussion on the issue of balancing civil rights with the ability of society to convict obvious criminals.

The storyline in this film moves at a breakneck pace, but is punctuated with humorous but significant side incidents that are absolutely rivetting and entertaining.  Most of the Dirty Harry franchise uses this approach with great effectiveness.  This is the film that made the .44 Magnum Smith & Wesson Revolver famous, and Clint Eastwood actually practiced firing the .44 Magnum at a firing range in order to make the action sequences involving firing the revolver realistic.  Gotta love that.

I have watched and liked every one of the ""Dirty Harry"" movies, but the original is still the best and this one deserves the overused label of ""Classic"" -- highly recommended.  RJB.",1420934400,,1627,4.912087912087912
91618,5,0790732300,"Dirty Harry is a crime thriller that happens to be the first in the Dirty Harry series. Clint Eastwood plays the title role, in his first outing as San Francisco Police Department Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan. The story is about a serial killer and ex-Vietnam War veteran who calls himself ""Scorpio"" murders a young woman in a San Francisco rooftop swimming pool at the Holiday Inn San Francisco, using a high-powered rifle. SFPD Homicide Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan is called in to investigate, and while examining the rooftop, discovers a shell casing and a note from Scorpio promising his next victim will be either a Catholic priest or an African-American if the city does not pay $100,000. The chief of police and the Mayor assigns Dirty Harry to solve the case.

Harry Callahan is a hard-working San Francisco cop who can't finish his lunch without having to foil a bank robbery with his 44 Magnum,also considered as ""the most powerful handgun in the world."" Harry and new partner Chico are assigned to hunt him down the serial killer, but not before the Mayor and Lt. Bressler admonish Callahan about his heavy- handed tactics.

Racing against a deadline to save a kidnap victim from suffocating to death and unbothered by the niceties of Miranda rights and search warrants, Callahan brings in Scorpio, only to see him released on technicalities. ""The law's crazy,"" opines Harry in disgust, before taking it upon himself to ensure that Scorpio doesn't kill again.

The movie is predictable and clichd but the iconic performance of Eastwood makes it engaging and entertaining. Aside from that,the violence and the language used also takes it into a new level of action as it becomes is still one of the most enjoyable films you could hope to sit down with for a couple of hours. The use of San Francisco as the location of the story also presents great mood in the story. And also,the two solid adversaries in conflict namely,Dirty Harry and Scorpio,makes the movie one of the best action films ever released in cinema.",1420588800,,2034,4.889855072463768

Inspector Harry Callahan is called Dirty Harry, he explains, because his superiors on the police force give him every dirty  dangerous  job. He doesnt mind bad-mouthing his superiors, even the mayor. The DA criticizes him for not acting according to the law, getting a warrant, etc. He doesnt want a partner because his partners get killed or badly wounded.
In this episode a sniper is killing a person a day until the city pays him $100,000, a huge amount of money in 1971. Soon the killer kidnaps a girl and Harry is assigned to bring him the money. Later he kidnaps an entire busload of kids, still later a single boy fishing in a lake. There is a lot of shooting and Callahan usually disobeys his superiors.
 Besides the main case, we see Callahan killing about half a dozen men who are trying to rob a bank and stopping a man from jumping off a building, he does the first heroically, the second in an unorthodox manner.",1417305600,,1004,4.445652173913044

Dirty Harry Callahan is a vengeful policeman disgusted with the ""hug-a-thug"" attitude of his law enforcement superiors, especially when a particularly crazy and violent hippie-type villain appears, slaughtering and torturing people and causing all sorts of mayhem.  In fact, he is an amalgamation of the various infamous bad guys of the era.  Callahan is rebuffed by his superiors when he tries to use violence and force against this villain, and in turn decides to use his own vigilante-like techniques to deal with him.

The movie came out at a time when the general public was becoming disillusioned with liberalism and its not unjustifiably perceived view of its softness on crime and violence, and though the villain was one-dimensional and over-the-top, he did represent the idea that there were criminals who were genuinely evil and not merely victims of society who could be cured with rehabilitation.

The above comes from this absorbing crime thriller  This film, which introduced ""Dirty Harry"" to the world, was one of the major movies that shot Clint Eastwood into super-stardom.

The first scenes of this movie are especially good, what I call ""signature Eastwood.""

Andy Robinson gives a mesmerizing performance as serial killer, Scorpio.

The finale of this movie is unforgettable.

The background music adds to each scene.

There was considerable controversy when this movie was first released.  This was over issues such as police brutality to victim's rights and the nature of law enforcement.  Feminists did not like this movie.

However, this controversy hasn't hurt this film's bottom line.  Its budget was four million dollars.  Its box office take too date is almost thirty-six million dollars.

Eastwood's iconic portrayal of the blunt, cynical, unorthodox detective in perpetual trouble with his incompetent bosses, set the style for a genre of ""loose-cannon"" cop films.

Finally, the DVD itself (the deluxe edition released in 2008) has four extras.  I found all of them interesting.

In conclusion, in my opinion, this was one of the best of the five Dirty Harry movies that was made.

91725,5,0790732300,"To answer Harry Callahan's twice-posed rhetorical question: it was only five.

When producer/director Don Siegel returned to San Francisco for DIRTY HARRY (1971) he was warmly welcomed by the city's administration. A dozen years or so earlier, Siegel used San Fran as backdrop for his late-era noir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-LINEUP/dp/B00BBGZA5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE LINEUP</a>. His many inside and outdoor location sequences showed the ""City By the Bay"" at its best, and the film's ""crime doesn't pay"" plot gave an equally flattering patina to SFPD.

One of the first things you notice about Clint Eastwood's Inspector Callahan is that his suit pants and dress trousers are all tailor-pegged. He isn't some indifferent flatfoot in baggy rumpled serge flapping around in stiff San Fran breezes. No, it's clear that Callahan, with impeccably coiffed hair and those cool shades, is more concerned about his appearance than he is about keeping the peace. In fact he's often the catalyst of mayhem, a foiled bank heist that occurs early in the story being a prime example.

In this scene Harry sits at his favorite hotdog diner, suspecting there's a 211 in progress across the street. When sure enough the bank's alarm sounds he reluctantly drops an ungarnished footlong dog, saunters outside, quickly kills three would-be hold-up men with his trusty .357 magnum pistol  and wings a fourth. This leads to a classic Eastwood line, spoken with an impish grin: ""...you've gotta ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?""

This bon mot is aimed at bit player Albert Popwell, here a downed bank robber who says to Callahan, ""I gots to know.""  In director Siegel's 1973 follow-up,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MAGNUM-FORCE/dp/B0015XHQU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MAGNUM FORCE</a>, Popwell plays a garishly attired pimp that forces DRANO down his girl's throat.

Under close examination, Andy Robinson's portrayal of the serial killer IDed only as ""Scorpio"" doesn't quite hold up. His take on the guy's insanity is too much over-the-top nervousness to appear sinister. His best moment acting-wise may be the liquor store scene. Robinson plays it restrained and straight but when he suddenly bashes the clerk's head with a fifth bottle of whiskey it startles you.

The central plot of DIRTY HARRY is simple yet effective. San Fran's mayor (John Vernon), chief of police (John Larch) and Callahan's immediate supervisor (Harry Guardino) all object to his violent tactics but he refuses to modify his way of law enforcement to accomodate them. Young ""Chico"" (Reni Santoni), Harry's new partner, sees how he operates and quickly figures out why he's been tagged with the ""Dirty"" label. In the end the might of Callahan, and that long-barrelled gun, triumph and we fade out after a watery&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HIGH-NOON/dp/B00006JMRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HIGH NOON</a>&nbsp;moment.

And not only that, you'll find your self hoping he breaks every rule in the book to get the job done. This role was meant for Clint Eastwood. No one on earth could play Harry but Clint. As a character goes, Harry is the greatest moment of Eastwood's acting career, And for 1971 this movie packed one hell of a lot of punch for the dollar. Harry in this first outing must outwit a crazed rooftop sniper known only by the name 'Scorpio', a character played to creepy perfection by Andy Robinson(Hell Raiser, Charley Varrick). Robinson is just great in this role and it is no doubt his most memorable performance. Along for the ride are Harry Gaurdino and John Vernon- both great 70's character actors, and Reni Santoni as Harry's Mexican partner is the perfect match. Without a doubt Dirty Harry is the perfect baddass cop movie.",1371427200,2,1344,4.675105485232067

91781,5,0790732300,"""Dirty"" Harry Callahan is one of those iconic characters that stands apart from the crowd. Who hasn't heard someone say, ""You've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?""

And he certainly lives up to the legend in ""Dirty Harry,"" a grimy cop thriller where morals are grey and justice isn't always served by the law. Clint Eastwood gives a quietly menacing performance that dominates every scene he's in, and sets up the standard for world-weary cops who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty in pursuit of justice.

A serial killer referred to as ""Scorpio"" is killing people in San Francisco, and even sends a letter to the police demanding money. If he doesn't get his way, he's going to kill again. The man on the case is Detective ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Eastwood), who manages to thwart Scorpio's efforts to kill a Catholic priest. The serial killer is so enraged that he rapes and buries a young girl alive, and threatens the police with her death if they don't give in to his demands.

Harry is sent on a wild chase through San Francisco with a giant bag of money, and eventually is able to corner and stop the Scorpio killer (Andrew Robinson). Unfortunately for everybody, Harry's ruthless treatment of Scorpio leads to the killer being released -- and now he's determined to frame Harry as revenge. It's up to Harry to take the law into his own hands before Scorpio kills again.

""Dirty Harry"" actually has a very simple story, loosely based on the Zodiac killings in the 1970s. The really memorable part of the movie is the presentation -- this was a cop story where innocents frequently die, the killer walks free sometimes, and the ""hero"" isn't particularly heroic. There's nothing romanticized or tidy about Dirty Harry's world.

And a lot of that comes from Eastwood himself. His performance as Callahan is the stuff of cinematic legend -- he's an anti-hero with nerves like barbed wire and eyes like steel buttons, and he cares far more about justice than law. What matters most to him is saving innocent lives and stopping the killer, and sometimes he has to step outside the law to do so.

And while Eastwood starts off as a simple cop protagonist, his presence grows more imposing as the story winds on. This isn't hurt by the demonstrations of his badassery -- such as threatening a robber with the legendary ""Do ya, punk? question"", then strolling off on a bloodied leg.

Director Don Siegel gives the movie a gritty, slightly grimy feel, with Callahan drifting through sleazy strip clubs, abandoned rock quarries and the occasional rooftop with a suicidal person clinging to it. And it has a strong feeling of realism, even during the more ""Hollywood"" scenes -- when Harry leaps off a bridge onto the roof of a schoolbus, it doesn't look like a stunt. It looks REAL.

He also injects a note of shocking horror into some of the scenes, such as when Robinson's Scorpio begins crazily threatening children when they start freaking out. It's especially scary because we've seen innocent people killed by this maniac, so we know he's perfectly capable of hurting the children.

""Dirty Harry"" became an instant classic for a reason -- not only does it introduce us to the gritty anti-hero cop, but it let the world know that Clint Eastwood was a legend. Harrowing, brilliant and bloody.",1364601600,2,3331,4.759098786828423

The story starts with a young woman diving into a swimming pool on the top of a tall building. A man with a rifle on top of a taller building shoots her! The police investigate this murder in San Francisco. They find an empty shell and an extortion note from ""Scorpio"". [That $100,000 tells about the value of money then.] The Mayor wants to know what the police are doing. [This dialogue sounds a little sleazy.] Harry notices a car parked by a bank while eating lunch. He doesn't miss much. [Shouldn't he reload?] Harry gets a new partner, a cop with a college degree in Sociology. A man is on the roof of a building and observes people down below. A police helicopter flies over and the man runs away. Later Harry sees a man with a suitcase and they follow him into a building. A wrong number? They are called away for another man on a roof. Not the shooter. [Is this meant as a comedy?]

There is another shooting victim, a ten-year old boy. Another victim of Scorpio. The police have a plan to catch Scorpio. Harry shoots at the suspect, who returns fire with a machine gun, then escapes! The next day they learn a 14-year old girl was kidnapped and buried for a $200,000 ransom! Harry will take the money to the kidnapper after being watched. He overcomes an obstacle, then meets the kidnapper. His partner exchanges shots, the sirens announce the police. But Scorpio gets away even with a wounded leg. [Believable? No dogs to track Scorpio?] The police get a tip on his identity and go to his apartment. The footsteps tell of the chase. Harry captures the man in a stadium. The DA summons Harry to ask him about Miranda and Escobedo. Was that search legal? No, the weapon can't be used for evidence. The prisoner is released. Harry tails him. There is a plot to create forged evidence of police brutality. Will it get Harry in trouble? He is warned.

Harry's partner is recuperating and reconsiders his career. Scorpio robs a liquor store. [From murder to robbery; what next?] Scorpio hijacks a school bus with children to get his $200,000 and a jet plane to take him out of the country. Who will deliver the ransom money? A man jumps onto the bus, which then stops by a mining operation. More shots are exchanged for action. The criminal runs toward a pond, then is wounded again. Does he feel lucky? Yes, but he loses again. Harry throws a piece of metal into the pond (symbolism). [Isn't he making a big mistake?]

This seems like a lower budget message movie written to mock the constitutional rights of anyone accused of a crime (Miranda, Escobedo, etc.). The Miranda warning was a return to traditional legal policies, not something newly created by the Supreme Court. It derives from the Fifth Amendment, which bans torture (forcing the accused to testify against himself). Those who don't know this legal history are unfit to criticize this or any of the other Amendments in the Bill of Rights. Having ""Scorpio"" walk with a limp also seems to mock the handicapped. This story is based on the true crime of the ""Zodiac Killer"" who wrote letters boasting of murders in the Frisco Bay Area from December 1968 to October 1969. He stopped his activity and was never caught. The movie ""Zodiac"" is also a better movie. Did the story of hijacking a school bus seem fantastic? This actually happened in the early 1980s in California. The criminals were soon caught and convicted. The later ""Dirty Harry"" action movies were faster pace, until the public tired of them.",1362614400,,3497,4.617363344051447

A deranged psychopath sets out to kill people in order to extort a ransom from the city of San Francisco. He begins by shooting a girl in her swimming pool and demands a $100,000 ransom to stop killing people. Andrew Robinson plays the psychopath Charles `Scorpio' Davis, and is scaringly convincing in the role. But Callaghan is not about to take any prisoners if he can help it, as his role in foiling a bank heist early in the movie shows.

Andy Robinson played such a convincing part as the villain I truly believe that's why we never saw him in too many movies after that , he would always be associated with that part & recognized. Even in the true life world of today how many criminals get off because of a technicality? Was this movie a precursor of a judicial system to come in the 80's,90's,etc?

91813,5,0790732300,"WEAPON OF CHOICE, FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWS

They say first is always best and never has that been more true than here. Four progressively inferior sequels follow DIRTY HARRY, charting not only a decline in script quality but also in the general believability of a character who ends up being little more than a one-note lethal weapon rather than the maverick detective who, finding himself up against the SFPD's interminable bureaucracy, prefers to let his Magnum .44 do at least some of the talking. Okay, THE ENFORCER and MAGNUM FORCE just about hold their own but Clint's age is beginning to show by the time SUDDEN IMPACT appears and, frankly, the less said about THE DEAD POOL the better.

There's so much in this film that bears repeated viewings. It's certainly a brutal affair, and definitely non-pc, with director DON SIEGEL blurring the distinctions between cop and killer to the point where it's not always easy to tell one from the other by behaviour alone. But thanks to a brilliant turn by ANDY ROBINSON as the lip-quivering psychopath SCORPIO, it's somewhat less difficult to brush aside any misgivings about Harry Callahan's unorthodox methods. Not so much 'cake and and eat it' as knife and twist it.

Great support from RENI SANTINO assigned to be yet another of his initially indifferent colleague's 'unlucky' partners, CHICO, taking the bullets in the superbly choreographed bloodbath set in Golden Gate Park. Surviving the machine-gunning, he is clearly wiser after the event as to the type of lawman Callahan represents, re-affirming just what the 'Dirty' prefix means as a bottom line definition.

The fast-paced direction ensures that there's a very real sense of tension in the race to rescue a young girl (kidnapped and subsequently buried alive by Scorpio) and prevent her from dying by suffocation. The fact that Harry is frustrated in his attempts and ultimately fails - leading to the discovery of her pallid corpse - only increases his determination to sidestep the law-enforcement 'establishment' and go after Scorpio in the way he knows gets results - much to the dismay of media-courting and increasingly irritable Mayor (JOHN VERNON) and Callahan's own exasperated boss, Lieutenant Bressler (HARRY GUARDINO). A terrifically downbeat ending is a reminder that those who are supposed to protect and serve occasionally cross the line and that sometimes it simply has to be that way. Depends how lucky a person feels on the day, I suppose.

QUOTED ENDLESSLY BECAUSE IT'S SO DAMN GOOD:
""...I know what you're thinkin', punk. You're thinkin', 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Now to tell you the truth, I've forgotten myself in all this excitement...but being this is a forty-four Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and will blow your head clean off...you've gotta ask yourself a question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya...PUNK?!!""

MOST POWERFUL SCENE(S): in the football ground under the floodlights as Harry steps on Scorpio's bullet wound to the leg; Scorpio's smashed-to-a-pulp face as he demands ""every penny's worth..."" of the beating he's arranged in order to frame his never-far-from-sight nemesis.

BLU-RAY PICTURE QUALITY: Superb, with a lot of detail not present on the regular DVD - you really get to know about a person's skin complexion via this format. There is still, however, a small amount of grain visible in the darker scenes, but that only adds to the gritty nature of the film as a whole and is not an issue.

BLU-RAY SOUND QUALITY: Excellent, bright and punchy in uncompressed 5.1. Brings to the fore composer LALO SCHIFRIN's cool and very 70's score.

A brilliant film, in it's best possible showcase. And Clint has never been more magnetic. Don't miss it.

91814,5,0790732300,"I can still remember Reni Santoni asking in the original DIRTY HARRY, ""Why do they call you Dirty Harry?"" Don Siegel's DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the disdain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. As viewers we cannot help but see it Harry's way under Don Siegel's direction. When the system breaks down, we are thankful that a blunt and decisive instrument comes forward and protects the innocent from all the parasitical freaks and dregs of their society. There is no job too dirty for Harry Callahan. There is something romantic about San Francisco, but the character of Harry is less a romanticized hero and simply just a necessary instrument to bring down the likes of psychopath Andy Robinson. And when Robinson goes down Eastwood symbolically tosses his badge in the drink for a thankless job well done.",1337040000,,1106,4.795811518324608
91815,5,0790732300,"This movie was released at a time when the American legal system was being changed and most of America wondered if the criminal had more rights than the law-abiding. It was a very much a movie of the time and place - the 60s in San Francisco. ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan very much echoed the sense of justice outraged felt by many.

This was the first major role for Clint Eastwood in American films (although he made many fans in his portrayals of the man with no name in Italian films) and he took full advantage of his opportinity with an very good performance in his role as Detective Harry Callahan.

Harry must track down and put an end to the reign of terror of ""Scorpio"" - a brutal serial killer. To do so, Harry must fight his own political, legal and police superiors. In the end, Harry does what must be done, breaking the ""rules"" in the process.

This a very good film that highlights issues still relavent today - though, without a resolution. The final scene where Callahan flings his badge into a pond is quite poignant.

The film does not have a star-studded cast, but employs veteran supporting actors like John Vernon and Harry Guardino who give solid performances. Clint Eastwood plays Callahan to the hilt and made quite an impression with his acting ability.

91816,5,0790732300,"Clint Eastwood was already an established actor in 1971, thanks to an extended stint on the TV horse opera ""Rawhide"" and his recurring role as ""the man with no name"" in three classic Sergio Leone ""spaghetti westerns.""  However, his now iconic role in ""Dirty Harry"" took Eastwood to the next level as a movie star, while establishing an enduring movie personna as a tough maverick cop.  Eastwood would play to and riff from this personna for years in subsequent movies.

""Dirty Harry"" has a straight-forward plot.  A deranged sniper calling himself Scorpio attempts to extort the City of San Francisco for ransom money.  Hard-nosed detective inspector Harry Callahan gets the job to catch him.  When Scorpio kidnaps a young woman, Callahan pulls out all the stops in an attempt to rescue her, including torturing a wounded Scorpio for information.  Scorpio will escape justice on civil rights violations, but neither he nor Callahan will walk away from a dramatic final confrontation.

""Dirty Harry"" has a couple of classic scenes at its beginning and end, in which Callahan gets to use his signature ""do you feel lucky"" speech while a suspect stares down the barrel of his .44 magnum handgun.  In between those scenes, the audience finds out that Callahan, in spite of his nickname and his obvious sense of alienation, is all about justice and not just the law.  The plot riffs off the then-current public suspicion that law enforcement was more concerned with the rights of criminals than of their victims, allowing Callahan to play the hero against City Hall as well as against the criminals.  The movie takes full advantage of its location San Francisco venue, while the plot passes quickly through its ""CSI"" stages in favor of getting its heroes and villains into the next action sequence.

You knew exactly who the bad guy was, but was there a good guy? Inspector Callahan isn't a bad cop, he just believes in protecting the innocent, and making sure those that do the crime do not get away with it. Does he take the law into his own hands? No. Does he break the law when he first captures Scorpio? Oh yeah, and we really don't seem to mind that he does. We have seen the violence and evil that Scorpio does, and we demand justice, whatever the cost, to stop and make Scorpio pay for the crimes he has committed.

It is great film making when you root for the cop to break the law, so you can have them strike back at those that have wronged society. But some public sentiment at the time was not very cop friendly, and some people have complained that Dirty Harry was a rogue and unstable cop, taking the law and justice into his own hands, and that Dirty Harry was a anti-cop film.

The film's axis is the conflict of criminal justice--the rights of the criminal--and, through Harry, the rights of the victims. Dirty Harry walks the fine line separating the law and the bad guys, often defying his superiors, disregarding the law,  breaking the law, and even becoming the law. Throughout the film,we slowly come to understand Harry but not completely. His world-view is black and white and his methods gets better and faster results than the courts and the legal process, characterized in the film as cool, bureaucratic, and slanted in favor of the criminal, personified by the Scorpio killer.

The film runs around 2 hours, a fast 2 hours that you won't notice because the film is so entertaining and often funny.

91833,5,0790732300,"Dirty Harry came out way back in 1971, 40 years ago, but it is still a great entertaining movie. It doesn't feel dated at all. If you read the reviews of this movie you seem to think that this is some kind of political debate between liberals and conservatives. A debate that has to do with criminal's rights, police brutality and the general decay of American society. However, I tend to look at this movie as a simple battle of good vs evil. Dirty Harry is by far the best of the series and I would give most of the credit to the antagonist of the film, the Scorpio killer (played chillingly well by Andy Robinson). Scorpio in my opinion is a completely unsympathetic villain. He is a brutal calculating killer; some of his exploits include raping and killing a 14 year old girl, shooting an innocent woman while she is swimming on a rooftop swimming pool. Scorpio is plainly and simply an urban demon. To combat this evil we need an avenging angel who believes in the Old Testament of an eye for an eye and a life for a life. We certainly can't trust the authorities like the District Attorney and the Mayor of San Francisco who are more concerned with the criminal's rights than with the innocent victims. Our angel comes in the guise of the tall, laconic Dirty Harry Callahan (played by the legendary Clint Eastwood). Harry ignores his superiors and simply goes after Scorpio with all the brutality which Scorpio uses on his victims. Harry knows that Scorpio must be killed to be stopped, there is no middle ground, no courts, no rehab centers, no prison. When comparing the original Dirty Harry movie to all the others it is important to look at the villains; in none of the other movies is there a villain who completely enrages the viewer like Scorpio. I don't feel much hatred for any of Harry's other enemies throughout the series as I do towards Scorpio. This is because of Robinson's great acting but also due to the writing. Scorpio is not a psycho, he is a calculating evil human being who knows his rights well. One of the most frustrating scenes is when Harry first captures Scorpio. Scorpio accuses Harry of trying to kill him and demands a lawyer and medical attention. This is a man who has just finished raping, torturing and murdering a 14 year old girl yet HE is a victim of police brutality! And what's worse is that in the next scene Scorpio is totally vindicated by the DA and a judge who are not worried about the dead 14 year old girl but about how Harry violated Scorpio's rights!! And Scorpio is set free by our system due to things like the Miranda and Escovedo rights. But our avenging angel is undeterred. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between Harry and the repulsive killer. When Scorpio finally gets his I as a viewer felt relief but also sadness because Harry seems to be quitting from being a cop when he tosses his badge in the river. The laws are made by ineffective men and lawyers who care more about not being sued and about criminal's rights. And Harry cannot in good conscience continue to defend such a system. I wonder how much more powerful this movie would have been if it had NOT been made into a franchise; because in the next movie Harry's quitting is conveniently forgotten! Therefore in my opinion Dirty Harry from 1971 stands above the entire franchise and it stands as one of the great entertaining cop thrillers of all time.

91838,5,0790732300,"The year was 1971.  For many of us living in that era, it appeared that the justice system was geared to protecting criminals more than their victims.  Every time a criminal walked free on a technicality, especially when it was clear that the criminal was guilty, we felt that much more helpless.  Along came Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry.

In a way, the character of Dirty Harry was very similar to the characters Clint played in his famous spaghetti westerns.  He was a man of few words and though his name was Harry Callahan, he really did not need a name, just like the Man with No Name.  Some even called ""Dirty Harry"" an urban version of a western.  Yet, Harry was somewhat different from the Man with No Name in that Harry had a great gut feel for justice and right and wrong.  Harry was never out for himself; his actions were always about protecting innocent people.

When we meet Harry at the beginning of the movie, we are privy to an incident that predates the present story.  Harry's boss advises him that there should not be a repeat of an earlier incident.  Harry points out that he felt obligated to stop someone who had intent to rape.  When Harry's boss asks how Harry knew what the man intended, Harry points out that when he sees a nude man in a clear state of arousal chasing a woman while holding a butcher knife, it seems as though the intent is clear.  I personally liked Harry from that point and I suspect so did most audience members.  We quickly see that Harry recognizes a crime in progress when he sees it and he will affirmatively halt that crime, even if he has to do so with his .44 magnum.

A man calling himself the Scorpio Killer shot a woman swimming on a rooftop.  He promises to kill again unless the city of San Francisco pays him.  Given what we know about the last several decades of history, we suspect that he will keep on killing even if he the city gives him the money.

The victims are piling up, but Harry is on the case.  Along the way there, we are treated to a scene where we see that Harry treats his actions as part of his job when he ""apprehends"" a group of bank robbers.  The final bank robber is lying in a doorway, shot.  Harry comes up to him and tells him he is unable to remember whether he fired five shots or six.  Harry asks him whether he feels lucky, a classic scene with a classic line.

Harry and his partner continue to pursue the Scorpio Killer, convincingly played by veteran actor Andrew Robinson.  As seemed typical for the era, the city keeps trying to appease the Scorpio Killer while Harry keeps trying to bring him to justice.  Even when the identity of the killer is known it appears that the justice system is impotent, unable to bring the killer to justice.  Harry, on the other hand, will get this murderer, kidnapper and abuser of children.

With the benefit of four decades of movie-making, we can see that ""Dirty Harry"" was a new class of police officer who led the way for legions of police officers frustrated with a cumbersome justice system that adheres to the rules so completely that it forgets to get justice.  The extras, which are very good, make this observation in detail.

Two extras I particularly liked were ""Dirty Harry's Way"" and ""Dirty Harry:  The Original.""  In addition to discussing the effect of ""Dirty Harry"" on the film industry, there is significant discussion of Harry's attitude.  Other extras include interviews, commentary by Clint Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel, and a ""Dirty Harry"" movie trailer gallery.

It is always clear that the bad guys are really bad and deserve their punishment.  Harry never gets it wrong.  Does Harry short-circuit the justice system?  Of course.  However, Harry is a fictional character.  While we may wish that criminals get justice much faster than our system seems to do, in reality, the system sometimes gets it wrong and the safeguards that cause the system to move slowly are there to help minimize the chance for mistakes.  Would most of us condone a real-life Dirty Harry?  Probably not.  However, it is fun to think about justice that gets our adrenaline flowing.

""Dirty Harry"" remains a highly original ground breaking movie that made way for dozens of others.  I have watched this movie many times and hopefully will watch it many more times.  It is one of the great movies, making a number of ""best of"" lists.  Violent and raw, though perhaps not all that violent by today's standards, it is not for everyone, but if you enjoy crime thrillers and can handle an R-rating, then this one is for you.

Enjoy!",1300838400,2,4564,4.565270935960591
91839,5,0790732300,"Often credited with spearheading the launch of a new genre of action films, Dirty Harry (1971), under the direction of Don Siegel, is a gritty, driving, crime drama that firmly lifted Clint Eastwood to superstardom.  Part of what makes the film such an effective thriller, is an extremely tight screenplay that has barely a wasted scene.  Siegel and Eastwood had developed a special relationship, having previously collaborated on several films, notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coogan-s-Bluff/dp/B0001FVDJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coogan's Bluff</a>&nbsp;(1968), and Dirty Harry would arguably be the high point of their achievements together.  The plot has a few sticking points, but overall events play so smoothly, that the film seems longer than its 102 minute running time.  Dirty Harry immediately draws you in, and takes you on a dark and twisted journey.

San Francisco police Inspector Harry Callahan is called to investigate the death of a woman, shot by a sniper while swimming in a rooftop pool.  On the roof of another building, Callahan finds a note from Scorpio (Andy Robinson) who demands that the City pay him a ransom, or he will kill again.  After reporting to the Mayor (John Vernon), Harry hits the streets with his new partner Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni), looking for the killer.  Scorpio kills again, but Callahan is beginning to close in.

An agitated Scorpio kidnaps a teenage girl, and threatens to kill her unless a ransom is paid.  Callahan volunteers to deliver the cash, and with Chico's help, manages to avoid being killed by Scorpio, shoving a knife into his leg at the base of the cross at Mount Davidson Park.  Callahan trails the wounded man to Kezar Stadium, where without warning, Harry guns Scorpio down with his .44 magnum.  In one of his most inflammatory acts, Harry tortures the injured man to get information about the location of the missing girl.  He succeeds, but when the police arrive, the teenager (Debralee Scott) is dead.  The film's last act, Scorpio hijacks a small school bus with children aboard, and demanding cash and a plane to leave the country.  The Major wants to pay the ransom, but Callahan has had enough, and takes matters into his own hands.

It may seem rather tame now, but Dirty Harry was a violent and controversial film at the time, and became the target of some critics.  It was certainly a well focused effort, as almost everything that happens is relevant to the central story.  There are a few peripheral scenes that fill in some details about Harry's personal life, but almost everything is related to finding Scorpio, and then bringing him to justice.

Even those that regard Dirty Harry as a terrific cop film, can probably concede that while often riveting, there are many times when reality doesn't get in the way of great drama.  Harry Callahan is something of a contradiction, as it doesn't seem possible that a veteran cop could not be aware of routine arrest and evidentiary procedures.  In addition to having some questionable tastes in clothes, Callahan is prone to going ""cowboy"", and while not entirely credible, at least Harry's actions are not superhuman.  The foiled bank robbery, and Harry's classic repartee with robber Albert Popwell, is pure cinematic gold.  Things are more problematic, when it comes to the rooftop stakeout, where Callahan opens fire on Scorpio without any probable cause, touching off a shootout that endangers the public.  Scorpio's choice of a submachine gun for a long distance kill at night, seems questionable.  Chico displays remarkable aim with an extremely powerful flashlight, as does Scorpio in shooting out a neon sign.  Apparently no one was hurt, as Harry remains assigned to the case.  The inspired and chilling performance of newcomer Andy Robinson, is one of the key elements to the film's success.  The character Scorpio, was supposedly inspired by the real life Zodiac Killler.  Scorpio's brutal ploy of having himself beaten up, so that he can claim that Callahan was responsible, is both provocative and odd, as nothing much comes from it.  Then although still injured, Scorpio's next move is to rob a liquor store to acquire a gun, so that he can hijack the bus.

Eastwood had already established an iconic presence in westerns, and Dirty Harry would mark his first appearance as a traditional modern cop (putting Coogan's Buff aside).  Eastwood initially turned down the role as Callahan, as he was making his directorial debut in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Play-Misty-for-Me/dp/B00005LC4R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Play Misty for Me</a>&nbsp;(1971).  Steve McQueen had passed on the Callahan role.  Frank Sinatra was interested, but dropped out.  Fortunately after Eastwood had completed his film, the role was still available.  Clint brought his directorial mentor Don Siegel (The Shootist, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) onboard, and a screen legend was born.  Composer Lalo Shifrin (Mission Impossible, Enter The Dragon), who also worked with Siegel and Eastwood on Coogan's Bluff, makes a tremendous contribution to the atmosphere of the film, with his haunting and at times driving soundtrack.

The Blu-ray edition contains the same extensive set of extras present in the two disc special edition, including featurettes about the significance and legacy of Dirty Harry, and on Eastwood (The Man From Malpaso).  A commentary by Eastwood himself would have been ideal, but we have to settle for one by biographer Richard Schickel.  Along with various interviews and testimonials, it's a pretty comprehensive package for a classic film, that has affected the course of action films in the 70's and well beyond, and spawned four Dirty Harry sequels so far.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry-Magnum-Force-Action-Double-Feature-Blu-ray/dp/B0032XNKX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry/Magnum Force (Action Double Feature) [Blu-ray</a>] is a particularly economical deal.",1290297600,,6075,5.51024811218986
91840,4,0790732300,"I regularly used to watch this film on VHS. Before today, it was probably about 7 years since the last time i saw the film. I remember i liked it before and i still like it after watching it again. I like the action scenes. In one scene i like is when Scorpio is shaking Harry`s head like a mad man, i just couldn`t help but to laugh.

I must also say i like the music in the film, from Lalo Schifrin. Who i think is a great composer. He is probably
most famous for making the great theme song to the Mission Impossible series original and the follow up series to the late 80`s version.

Picture Quality: 4/5

I don`t remember how it looked on VHS, but it probably didn`t look so good. I was suprised how good the picture quality was. I think there was much details in close ups and such. The colours looked clear, like the blood you see in some scenes. I was happy with the picture quality.

Audio Quality: 4/5

I think this audio track was pretty good, except in the bank robbery where Clint fires his Magnum, for some strange reason, it does not have that great bass in does in the later action scenes. Hm. It`s ok, but i don`t understand that. Did they forget to add bass to his Magnum in that scene or whatever method they use? I think the machine gun that Scorpio has could had a bit more bass. One of the badguys in that robbery, had a shotgun which i think had great deep bass.

The dialog sounded good in my Center speaker, but i think it was mixed too low. The music was also good in the Center speaker. Other than the 3 mentioned things, i had no problems with the Dolby TrueHD 5.1. I heard good bass from the music and shootouts from my subwoofer. I thought the rear speakers would be be used less. but i was happy the times they was used. You will hear: gunfire, train, buss, music, and noise from a stone factory, in the rear speakers.

If you look at this item's picture (at the top of this web page) you see a `bullet hole' at the end of the gun's barrel.  That hole is NOT part of the picture, it is an actual jagged hole in a clear plastic sleve that slides over the DVD case (the glass cracks are also printed on that sleve).

If you are a collecter of this (Dirty Harry) series and have other movies with that bullet hole sleeve you should be aware that this movie ordered from Amazon will NOT have that sleeve even though it is shown in Amazon's picture.  C'mon Amazon, pay attention to the details.  Either furnish the DVD case WITH the sleeve or correct the picture.

Blurring the lines and challenging

The scene in the stadium is amazing.

acted to perfection by Andrew Robinson.
I love those kind of details.

Then there's the gun.
The Smith and Wesson .44 Magnum
that can ""blow your head clean off"".

all guns in movie history.
It was one of the stars of the movie.

You can't help but smile when Harry
takes a bite out of his foot-long

long-distance from the diner doorway

fresh air.

It is so nearly perfect, that I feel
somewhat guilty rating it with three

The problem is that a terrible decision
was made to blemish this film with
ridiculous, exploitative and completely
gratuitous female nudity.
Not once, but three times.
It is as if the film producers consulted
with a morally challenged 12 year old
and mistook his desire to
""see more boobies"" as wisdom.

I do not include the scene of the
nude, murdered girl being extracted
from the sewer(?) pipe.
That was plot-related and had dramatic
effect, although the body appeared
to be the beautiful, clean and healthy
living body of a young woman,
not the brutalized, several days dead
and discarded body of a crime victim.

Let's see, there is Hot Mary hanging
the boobies out a window twice in case
you missed it the first time,
the totally nude woman prancing about
and greeting her guests nude viewed
through Harry's binoculars and the
apartment window, and the strippers
showcased in the nightclub.

If the idea was to show the depraved
underbelly of the city or one of the
reasons Harry is called ""Dirty""
(his voyeuristic tendencies),
it ought to have been done differently.

These scenes ruin the otherwise genius
of the movie and its landscape.

Harry is chasing the murderer...
nude interlude.
Harry is watching for the murderer...
nude interlude.
Harry is following the murderer...
nude interlude.

I felt embarassed for Lalo Schifrin,
whose musical score is amazing,
having to include a

Oh, I'd seen plenty of ads, heard jokes, read reviews, and had seen other of Clint Eastwood's movies but, in fact, had never viewed ""Dirty Harry"" or any of the sequels. Well, my wife and I were looking over the cheap DVD racks at a major discounter and there were a selection of Dirty Harry Series movies available at a bargain price. My wife (from Russia) had never heard of them, but I convinced her to try a couple: ""Dirty Harry"" and ""The Enforcer.""

""Dirty Harry"" is a fine movie and we both enjoyed it. Dirty Harry, of course, is a self-styled, politically incorrect, do-it-my-own way type of San Francisco police inspector out to rid the world of bad guys in as short a time as possible and without all the modern niceties. Eastwood's Harry character is not unlike many of the characters he has played in his famous western films. I got a chuckle out of his tough-guy doings and my wife commented that she thought police work should be more angled in that direction (remember, she's from Russia). In any case, it was an interesting movie regarding the rise and demise of a serial killer and was nicely put together. I particularly enjoyed viewing mid-70s San Francisco. The night photography was slightly too dark for good visibility on our home screen and the sound was not the best. Of course, the bargain price on the 40-year-old movie made up for the deficiency. It was an excellent movie. We're looking forward to ""The Enforcer"" and possibly several others.

91857,5,0790732300,"""Dirty Harry"" has to be taken in the context of the time it was released.  Recent High Court decisions hampered the authority of the constabulary.  There was civil unrest and there was a feeling among some of the populace that the criminal element of society was being coddled by the courts.  All you have to do is look at my own hometown, Philadephia, where a cop, Frank Rizzo, was elected mayor and went by the monicker ""Billy the Kid"".  This film serves to vent the frustrations of the law abiding who feel they are at the mercy of the hoodlums.  Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) isn't so much a vigilante but a cop, disgruntled with the system, who when occasion calls bends the rules to restore law and order.  His adversary here is an amoral serial killer, Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), who cleverly plays the system to walk away from his heinous crimes.  It's of little irony that Scorpio sports a belt buckle with a distorted peace sign.  Director Don Siegel films the action in a gritty style and the story is a non-stop adrenaline rush.  I first saw ""Dirty Harry"" about 25 years ago and it left more of an impression then.  This is not to say the film is dated but I think it's that our men in blue have been restored to hero status and that we now have a more common sense approach to prosecuting the criminal element.",1270166400,,1325,4.483333333333333
91858,5,0790732300,"When this came out in 1971, America was so polorized, people either loved or hated Dirty Harry. Doves Vs. Hawks. No need to go into who was on what side and why. We all know.

This cultural split has gone the way of rotery phones. When you look at the film now, it poses quetions more ambiguous than anyone might have seen through the dove v. hawk smoke of 1971

How do we, as a rational society, deal with serious social pathology? The question goes back to Moses, and we have not yet answered it.

Now, Harry Callahan is one dangerous dude. He actually means well, such as when he breaks up a robbery, or runs from pay phone to pay phone to try to save the life of a kid abducted by a sniper/ kiddie rapist, Scorpio.

But he also shoots first and then asks questions. He sure does like that gun. He tortures Scorpio to get the location of the adolesent rape victim. Harry knows you can't reason with evil. Yet, you see in the film that the girl dies anyway, so his torture did not do any good.

Let's look at this both ways. I am a card carrying member of the  ACLU and a proud lefty. I relaize that these tactics don't work, and usually are used on the wrong guy.

But i am a  person, too, and if it were my little girl in that hole, you bet I'd want Harry dancing on Scorpio's wounded leg until the SOB sang. Any mom or dad would, I don't care how liberal they are.

Either way, these are not cut and dry questions, and this is the point I think Seigal and Eastwood were trying to make. When everyone was taking sides in 1971, both the actor and the director were smart enough to see the ambiguities and leave them unanswered. Harry may have become a action hero in sequals, but for this film, he is not a Hollywood commodity as much as a channel for issues America was, and still is, grappling with.

One more point: in 1971, Miranda had only been law five years. There was little forensic psychology, no use of DNA. Police did not have many of the techniques we see on Law and Order or NCIS today. Police who could have strongarmed suspects before Miranda were at a loss of how to handle all this, which brings us back to my initial question: What DO you do when a madman has a child?

Mind you there was some stuff that was cut out, and edited in the movie, so it could be shown on t.v., but it was done splendidly. I feel what made this a classic was the fact that it was the first one ever done, and it introduced movies to the homicidal maniac. I know that movies before had stories of homicidal maniacs, but this would be the first one where you actually saw the killings. Well you saw the first one anyway. I know that this equals with the film ""The Hitchhiker"" as the most intense film ever. I also like the way it was filmed on location in San Francisco, and maybe one of these days I will actually take a trip there. The soundtrack is top notch, and it took me forever to find it on cd.

This movie is actually better than I recall back when I was 17 in 1969.  McQueen should have won an Oscar for that performance.  ""Dirty Harry"" is inferior in every way: script, direction, sound, and acting. I had trouble staying with ""Dirty Harry"" what with all the 70s clichs that kept popping up to spoil it.  But ""Bullit"" was fascinating from start to finish.  Like James Dean, you have a hard time keeping your eyes off Steve McQueen, whether he is speaking or reacting.  ""Dirty Harry"" is a very mediocre film that looks more like something made for TV, and it has not aged well.  ""Bullit"" is the real deal and deserves the moniker of ""iconic"".

91880,2,0790732300,"The cream always rises to the top and the fact that this film is still among many people's favourite detective flicks and from which many scenes and elements have been copied by other flicks over the years shows that this film is a classic to stand the test of time.  From the running around the town jumping hoops for a demented villain (see Die Hard 3) to the attempting to rescue a hijacked bus (see Speed) to humorously taking down a high rise jump suicide attempter (see Lethal Weapon)all these ideas have influenced these and countless other wannabe's.  Even the overall mood of this film reminded me a little of ""Silence of the Lambs"" as well.  This film did borrow from ""High Noon"" though when Callahan throws his badge away.  I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  This was a perfect film that was very well directed and Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry was excellent casting; to think that they wanted Frank Sinatra at first!  It's a shame with Siegal's passing in 1991, no new Director's Cut version of this movie can be made which is truly a tragic waste of an opportunity by the studios.

Another tragedy is the very poor picture quality of this dvd.  The master must have been severely deteriorated for us to get even sub-vhs quality with lots of white spots on almost every frame.  This classic deserves a lot better than this and I'm hoping the newly released Blu-ray version would feature a significantly improved picture quality.

The sound quality however is excellent having been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  It was so good that in the scene with the rooftop shootout when the neon lights were popping I could have sworn that it was happening just beside me in my living room the cracking glass sound was just so realistic.  If they could keep this sound quality and really massively fix the picture quality aspect, this dvd would get a perfect 5 star score from me.  Also, there are no special features worth mentioning on this version of the dvd although I understand there are loads on the Blu-ray version.

Excellent detective drama but poor dvd version and so I'd recommend you either getting the Blu-ray version or wait for a new standard release with vastly improved picture quality; unfortunately, with the advent of Blu-ray I think the latter option is unlikely to come to pass.

Updated 18 September 2011:

Amazon will not allow me to do this separately and so I'll have to do it here; the digibook Blu-ray version of this great film is a disappointment as both the picture and sound quality hasn't been improved over the standard dvd version that I reviewed above.  While I'm a big fan of digibooks in general and the one we get here is great the picture quality is littered with imperfections like black spots from the very start while the credits are being run and the rest of the film looks nothing like what you'd expect from a 1080p treatment.  The sound quality is barely an improvement over the standard dvd release too.

I would wait for the inevitable re-release of this blu-ray in the future making sure that they actually did something positive to both the picture and sound quality.  As for this release, it is certainly not worth the double-dip let alone a single dip; if you don't already have this on disc wait for a better quality release.

91902,5,0790732300,"Warner Brothers is going to ""make the day"" of Clint Eastwood fans everywhere on June 3rd when they release all five Dirty Harry films on special edition DVDs with all-new bonus features.  With Eastwood in the starring role, Dirty Harry would one of the most influential films of the 1970s.  This would usher in an era of gritty crime dramas and would open the door for such films as Shaft and Death Wish.  Even John Wayne would put down his cowboy hat and play a Dirty Harry-style cop in McQ.  Dirty Harry wasn't an action hero and it's almost impossible to think that the film could have been made today when there is so much reliance on over-the-top action and CGI special effects.

This film came along at a time during the Viet Nam-era when there was so much disillusionment in the country.  Harry Callahan wasn't the action hero; he was the anti-hero, constantly at odds with authority including his police chief and the Mayor.  We see almost nothing of Harry's personal life, almost as if he didn't exist outside of his job with the San Francisco PD.  It's a clever touch by the writers and Director Don Siegel to show the obsessive drive of the character.  Nothing mattered to Harry more than catching the bad guys no matter what it took.

Andrew Robinson turns in a memorable performance as a psychotic sniper dubbed Scorpio.  After killing one girl, he demands a ransom from the city or he promises to kill again.  The case is assigned to Callahan and in a bit that would be repeated through the film series, he is teamed with a new, young partner, this time Chico Sanchez (Rene Santoni).  You know all you need to know about Callahan's character when he captures Scorpio but is forced to watch the prosecutor release him because Harry didn't give him his rights.  Callahan wants to know who was looking out for the latest victim of Scorpio.  This will set the table for Eastwood to deliver his famous, ""Do you feel lucky punk"" offer to Scoprio at the film's climax.

Nearly 40 years later Dirty Harry still holds up well.  Eastwood is the model of cool.  As a bank robbery interrupts his lunch at a diner, Callahan foils the robbery while still finishing off his hot dog!  The film has a catchy, jazz soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin.  You need only listen for a few moments to know you're watching one of those memorable cop films.  Presented in letterbox format, Dirty Harry has never looked better.  This is one of the most important films of the 1970s.

Extras

Clint Eastwood's biographer, Richard Schickel provides an all-new commentary on the film.  While Schickel can be dry and goes several minutes without speaking, he offers some insightful views on the film.

Dirty Harry's Way is a 7:00 promotional piece produced in the 1970s which helped to hype the film and draws comparisons to film noir of the 1940s.

Dirty Harry the original is a 29:00 documentary from the 1990s and is hosted by the late Robert Urich who had a role in the second Dirty Harry film, Magnum Force.

The Long Shadow of Harry Callahan (25:00) is a new feature and takes a look at the roots of the 70's cop dramas as being urban westerns.  Modern filmmakers and actors share their thoughts on the landmark film and how it has influenced their own work.

The Man from Malpaso is a 58:00 biography on Eastwood originally produced in 1993.",1219363200,2,3323,4.611584327086883
91903,5,0790732300,"It was unannounced before it's release, but this(and box set)Blu-ray version, as well as regular DVD, includes Japanese dub which is quite unusual....but off cause, great!

Japanese dub is featuring late Yasuo Yamada, whose performance is still well known for anime ""Lupin 3rd"", made his voice acting carrier bigger and contributed Eastwood's popularity in Japan for more than 30 years. Japanese baby boomer will definitely appreciate Warner's great effort.

As for the movie and disc...""Dirty Harry"" is not dirty after all. This is one of the best presentation of American movie in '70s. Please buy it and see it for yourself. Highly recommended.",1215216000,,647,5.271844660194175
91904,4,0790732300,"This review applies only to the 2008 DVD reissue.

Having a carefully-remastered edition of Dirty Harry is, if not joy, then at least a cautionary message to those who feel unlucky.  The transfer preserves much of the grainy quality which seems to have been endemic to films of the late '60s and early '70s, while cleaning up the image in a non-intrusive manner.  This was my first time to see the film in widescreen, so I cannot say if the 2.35:1 ratio is correct.  However, I am almost sure that this film was initially released with a monaural soundtrack.  For the 2008 reissue, the film's soundtrack has been re-routed into the now-ubiquitous 5.1 Dolby Surround format.  This creates several problems.  On the one hand, the sound drops in and out in an unpredictable manner on mono or stereo televisions.  On the other, the assumption that every watcher would want to see Dirty Harry in full surround sound is a bit presumptuous.  I would rather see the film in its remastered glory with the original soundtrack, which could have been no more than stereo.  Using 5.1 surround sound only is a bit of technical elitism on the part of Warner Brothers.  Still, this is a seminal film of the zeitgeist that was the Sixties as well as being the template for the ""Bad Cop with a Heart of Gold"" films which followed in its footsteps.  This is the first, and by far the best.  I only dock it one star in my pompous fashion for the manner in which the studio has imposed the 5.1 Dolby Surround sound on the buyers of the film in this latest incarnation.",1215043200,5,1547,4.541516245487364
91905,5,0790732300,"If you want to know what was on the minds of most Americans in the early 1970's then watch DIRTY HARRY and the Charles Bronson film DEATH WISH.  Both deal with the rising tide of violent crime of that era and a yearning for swift and certain retribution.  Both films cemented the careers of their stars -- ironically, Frank Sinatra had been slated to do DIRTY HARRY but an injury that kept him from being able to handle a .44 Magnum forced him to bow out.  After all these years, it's hard to see anyone but Eastwood in the role.",1215043200,,529,4.27
91906,5,0790732300,"This new addition of ""Dirty Harry"" comes out with the other four movies.  One can buy them separately are altogether in a box set.  Yes, the first movie (Dirty Harry) is a two disc special addition.  The extras are nice, but let us be honest:  once watches Eastwood as Inspector Callahan, because in a world (especially in the 70s when it appeared ""bad guys"" had more rights than ever before), one man sought justice and sometimes that took him outside the law.

Second, the movie is clever.  Eastwood sells it and his Dirty Harry is tough, rugged, but also one detects he actually cares in his own way.  Andy Robinson is great as Scorpio.  The one liners from Eastwood are delivered wonderfully.  This movie not only spawns four more sequels, but other movies in the same vain such as ""Death Wish"" and ""Lethal Weapon.""

I am not going to rehash the story - instead, watch it for the witty dialogue, great scene staging, and Eastwood as a tough cop who is out to protect the innocent - and he does so in style.",1214870400,,1010,4.469945355191257
91907,5,0790732300,"Forget the caricature that developed with the sequels.  This  picture is a standalone classic of American film making that has move in common with The Conversation and Taxi Driver than it does with Lethal Weapon.  And as an anti-heroic portait of a cop I think it holds up better than French Connection.  It redefined the big-screen police thriller and - unless I'm forgeting something -- virtually invented the realistic serial killer genre.

Don Siegel's in the zone here -- this is his best film and it's never looked this good, partly because it's never looked this dim.  The night scenes are restored to such lustrous blacks you have to sit up and pay attention.  His work is completely thrilling and the portraits of both cop and killer he creates are filled with provactive ideas.

The film caught flak for suggesting that Harry was no better than a deranged vigilante -- as if the filmmakers didn't know that.  The film opens with Scorpio stalking a victim and killing her long range.  When Harry shows up he instinctively locates the killer's stalking place and we see him standing in the same spot looking at the scene of the crime within seconds.  Note later as well that Harry will knowingly speak on behalf of the killer.  (""You know she's dead, don't you?""  ""He won't stop killing.  He likes it."")  At those moments it's clear from Clint's face that he knows he and the killer have much in common.  (It's also plain that Harry's a voyeur as we get scenes of him as an ignoble Peeping Tom.)  The film seems to be saying that these two are remarkably similar and yet essentially different and for it's own good society had better understand the difference.

As iconic as Eastwood's performance here has become, I don't think the film would have the impact it has were it not for the astonishing performance of Andy Robinson.  This is before Lawrence Sanders wrote The 1st Deadly Sin or Thomas Harris wrote Red Dragon.  It has to be the first truly remorseless, psychotic, sadistic fiend in American pop culture.  He's completely believable and there's no ironic wit or psychological justification.  His performance is still terrifying, it hasn't dated at all and it stands as one of the great screen performances of all time.  (He gets a great assist from Lalo's sensational score.)

The extras here are a little light on insight into the development and filming of this first film and instead provide a survey that covers the whole series.  Schickel's commentary track is okay, but still has his patented air of snobbish condescension. He neglects to provide any insight into the film's curious religious symbolism -- the first three encounters between Harry and Scorpio involve crosses.  Nor does he draw any connections between the film and the real Zodiac killer who obviously inspired much of the detail of the criminal and his crimes.",1214611200,6,2852,4.828865979381443
91908,5,0790732300,"I'm not the kind of viewer that some people would identify as a fan of Dirty Harry (I'm a proud liberal who always votes Democratic and who owns no weapons) but I love this film without reservations.  First, let's give it up for Don Siegel, one of the best US directors of the post-WW2 era.  The man knew how to make a movie.  And he did with first-rate craftsmanship that never calls too much attention to itself.  This police thriller is as lean, mean, and no-nonsense as its flawed hero, played with the understated brilliance that only Clint Eastwood has mastered.  Yes, he's a damn good actor and that's mainly because he doesn't ACT--rather, he behaves as this character, who is a fantasy figure, would behave.  Siegel also gets solid acting across the board from his veteran cast, and with the help of Andy Robinson, who's as over the top as Clint is restrained, gives us one of the best, most vile villains committed to celluloid.  There are interesting psychological dimensions to the film and I found myself wondering if Scorpio represents everything Harry represses and fears in himself, taken to a hideous extreme.  Bruce Surtees found a one-of-a-kind look for Siegel's classic, with his inky San Francisco nightscapes making the hunt for Scorpio as strangely beautiful as it is unnerving.  As to DH's politics, they are more complicated than most people assume.  Dismissing this movie as reactionary, right-wing, or even as fascist as some have done, overlooks the nuances of Harry's conflicts with various institutions.  The film makes the point that our institutions, especially law and government, often pay lip service to protecting the common people while ignoring their victimization and their victimizers.  I see Harry as an embodiment of social and institutional breakdown who is overtaken by the idea that only extreme measures will work to make things right.  And when you consider DH in context with the follow up Magnum Force, in which Harry takes on a band of renegade cops who truly are fascistic, the controversies over DH's agenda and messages become even more complex.  P.S. the set is beautifully packaged with great extras at a reasonable price.",1214092800,10,2177,4.9779005524861875

91933,5,0790732300,"As a kid growing up in the early '70s, I thought that Clint Eastwood's 'Dirty Harry' character was the coolest. I still have a distinct memory of scotch taping a picture of Clint (brandishing his 44 Magnum at the camera lense) to my elementary school notebook binder and proudly taking it too class. (Hey, I'd love to see a kid get away with that today!)

I loved the ""Dirty Harry"" series of films, but my favorite has always been the Don Siegel directed, 1971 original, ""Dirty Harry"". In that film we first meet the stoic, no-nonsese, larger than life, Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood). Its explained that he's called 'Dirty Harry' because ""Harry dosn't play favorites, Harry hates everybody"" (followed by a long list of unprintable racial profanities).

But the real reason is that Callahan seems be the only one to take on the truely dirty jobs, that no one wants to deal with. He does this in spite of the hinderance of politicians, bosses and beauracrats, who seem more obsessed with following the letter of the law, rather then seeing that justice is served. When Harry can no longer make sense of the laws he's suppose to uphold, he relies on his own code and takes matters into his own hands.

In this case it involves taking on a psychopath called the 'Scorpio Killer' (Andy Robinson), who tauntingly uses rooftop assassination and child kidnapping to extort money from the City of San Fransico. I think one of the things that elevates this film above the others in the series is just how good the villian is. Yes, Clint Eastwood created an iconic character. But for every 'ying' you gotta have that 'yang'. Actor, Andy Robinson, in an underrated performance, has masterfully created one of the great villians of the cinema. Harry calls him a ""punk"" and thats an apt description. But he's also sick, vile, demented, tricky and really smart, able to play the system for all he can get. (Thank goodness, Harry shows up on that bridge!)

This film features Don Siegel's wonderful direction, which is cinematically both taunt and suspenseful. The action scenes are brilliantly set up and even after over thirty years of repeated viewings still hold up. Who can forget, that early classic scene featuring Harry munching on his lunch, while foiling a bank robbery in progress and uttering his classic ""Do you feel lucky punk?"" speech? Classic action at its best!

""Dirty Harry"" has now been released in a two-disc special edition. The picture looks amazing and the sound is crystal clear for a film from 1971. Some of the ""Extras"" (including some interesting 'what does it all mean?' documentaries) are repeats from the original 2001 DVD release and the new material isn't all that essential. Despite this, I'm still happy with this freshly scrubbed new edition. I love the broken glass, graphic style slip case and really enjoyed revisiting this classic action film from my childhood.

I've been aware of them, of course, since I'm a living, breathing person living in America in the latter-half of the 20th century (and early part of the 21st, but there haven't been any new Dirty Harry movies this century... yet).

The movie tells the story of a cop who screws up a bust, breaks the law, and thus winds up preventing a suspect from being charged. Of course, I'm not supposed to think that's what the movie's about. I'm supposed to think it's about a hero cop standing up against... against... man, I don't know what. Not a corrupt system. Not against other officers on the take. Really, it seems like the only enemy, aside from Scorpio, is, in fact, the Constitution.

91935,5,0790732300,"Dirty Harry is generally regarded as a classic, the beginning of a second larger-than-life persona for Clint Eastwood (after The Man with No Name). It's the source of the famous ""Do you feel lucky?  Well, do ya, punk?""  (The actual quote is ""... you've got to ask yourself a question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?"" but the original doesn't quote as well out of context.)

Tough cop ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan has his own simple, commonsense rules for dealing with crime, based on a strong sense of right and wrong and an impatience with needless details and constraints.  The latter gets him into continual trouble with the system which, as portrayed in the movie, is more about politics and bureaucracy than doing what needs to be done.  This reflected well the frustrations and fears of Americans in the '70s that criminals were taking over the streets and that the law was powerless to stop them because the ""criminal-coddling"" courts were holding them back.  I personally value the Fourth Amendment and other such niceties and shiver to think of some of the political and moral ramifications of this movie (some of which are still very much with us), but whatever one's politics, Dirty Harry is very effective as a police-action thriller, largely because of Eastwood's unique persona.  It's hard not to admire and root for him even if you think he's not always right.  There are also the standard gunfights and car chases, and high suspense, all well done.

In the films that followed in the series, Harry became a somewhat more balanced, complex or confusing character, depending on your point of view, coming down clearly on the side of the law against rogue vigilante cops, for example, and learning to appreciate a female cop as a partner, but the basic idea of Harry standing strong despite the corrupt, wimpy system remained.

than when it came out in 1971.
To some, it may seem politically incorrect,

Lynyrd Skynyrd, Aerosmith and Kiss were born, they weren't censoring are beloved cartoons we grew up with and you could say something and it didn't offend some group of individuals. It also gave us a very important icon Dirty Harry!  This self titled film is the first in a series of 5 films. One of the best pictures of it's kind. Clint is money baby as Harry, also Andy Robinson is to be commended for the terrific and convincing job he did as the Scorpion Killer!  I believed this guy was a real sick cat! This is the one that started it all and should not be missed. The DVD transfer looked very good and there are some extra goodies on the disc. This ones for you CB! ;-)",1185494400,,702,4.192592592592592
91939,5,0790732300,"In terms of acting this is perhaps the role that defined Clint Eastwood as a movie icon. The reasons for this are threefold:

1. Its directed by Don Siegel, so not a shot is wasted (a big influence on Clint Eastwoods later directing career).

2. The screenplay gives Eastwood the chance to deliver some classic lines.

3. The rest of the cast are excellent. Particularly John Vernon as The Mayor and the exceptional Andrew Robinson as Scorpio.

Of course Eastwood himself should be given as much credit as anyone. He wasn't the first choice for the movie, but if somebodyelse had taken the leading role it wouldn't have had the same impact. Eastwood's huge screen presence, and caustic delivery of his lines is unmatched in cinema history. I'm not saying he's the greatest actor, he is good though, but what he lacks in pure acting ability he more than makes up for in these other qualities.

It would be amazing if you haven't seen this film, but if you are of the generation born after this was made and have somehow missed it I recommend buying the DVD without delay. For those that have seen it many many times (like me) it holds up to repeated viewings so its still worth buying, to see it in widescreen with 5.1 sound.",1182470400,2,1224,4.545454545454546
91940,5,0790732300,"The more I watch ""Dirty Harry"" the more this movie stands out, not only as a classic example of 70s American cinema, but it illustrates in no uncertain terms that the meek will not herit the earth. Andrew Robinson's character, Scorpio, turns in a performance like no other; he is brilliantly over-the-top in his craziness. But the kudos must go the world-weary and violent Det. Harry Calahan. Clint Eastwood turns in an extraordinary performance as the cool and remorseless Calahan. For Calahan, the only thing the Justice System is meant to do is protect the criminals. If Calahan has his way, every criminal would get a bullet in the head and a second one for good measure. One cannot help but cheer on Calahan as he tortures confessions out of criminals and puts his .44 Magnum in their faces and asks them, ""Do they feel lucky?"" Yeah, I can get used to justice Harry Calahan's way. Even in the scene of the night time drives through the city's filthy redlight districts, one cannot help but believe if we killed everyone on that street at that moment, the world would be a better place. As for the Justice System, their belief that they are the guardians of all that is civilized and good is nonsense when they are the first to defend the criminals' rights before the victims. When Calahan asks the D.A. ""Who speaks for this dead 14 year old girl?"" all the D.A. can do is offer excuses and wax on about the integrity of the law and the courts. Obviously, the guardians of civilization are powerless in the face of real evil. We need more Calahans to clean our streets, and then civilization will survive.",1172966400,4,1608,4.606271777003484
91941,5,0790732300,"A lot of aspects of this movie are a bit dated. For example, the violence is cartoonish and unrealistic. The blood in the movie looks fake. And the city itself acts unrealistic. People went about their daily business even though a sniper was in their midst. In reality, mass panic would ensue, like it did in the DC area a few years ago,

With that said, the story here was awesome. One man, standing for what's right, going after the evil criminal despite being blocked every step of the way by bureaucracy and bleeding-heart lawyers.

A movie like this would never be made today, because our society has become too feminized and liberal. For that reason, 5 stars all the way.",1172102400,7,677,4.586776859504132
91952,5,0790732300,"DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. This seemed to be director Don Siegel's view and was latter propagated in subsequent Dirty Harry films by Eastwood. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the distain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. This film remains the benchmark for the philosophical and social views of this character and his times and certainly requires repeated viewing as the proliferation of undesirable elements in our society continues on an exponential rise. Eastwood's Harry is a multi-dimensional thinking man's blunt tool who can only get the job done alone and on his terms. Andrew Robinson as the Scorpio Killer is the personification of everything that has gone wrong with society and is a product of society's failure to deal with him rationally. John Vernon as the Mayor seem so to be just another elected politician out of touch with society and his constituents yet he somehow inherently recognizes and approves Harry's methods when he says ""He's got a point"" in a scene in the mayor's office. I particularly like Reni Santoni as the rookie detective and Harry Guardino as Eastwood's boss. Santoni is good cop but recognizes what is out there on the streets and knows the job is never going to get done by conventional methods and so he must decide his own future on the force. Guardino knows the score but continually tries to walk a thin line buffering Harry by letting him get the job done and keeping the bureaucrats off his back.

91954,4,0790732300,"This is one of those films that preys on the fears and emotions of its viewers, but does it rather well. It purposely contrives situations in order to gain our sympathies for the characters it wants. ""Lethal Weapon 2"" did this by having the evil South African government offical proclaim, ""Diplomatic immunity!"" after committing a heinous crime. In ""Dirty Harry,"" the Scorpio Killer claims police brutality after receiving a well-deserved beating. Makes for a nice story and usually achieves its goal, though it simultaneously insults us as viewers. Nonetheless, I have a weakness for serial killer movies, especially when written well. This one is particularly memorable because it features Clint Eastwood in the title role, though Andy Robinson is at least as remarkable as the Scorpio Killer. Harry Callahan is dubbed ""Dirty"" because he refuses to play by the rules. He represents the biggest challenge to the killer, so the cat and mouse game ensues. Can Harry stop him before he kills again? Long a fantasy for upstanding citizens, this film is increasingly on its way toward becoming a reality (courtesy the NRA), due to laws permitting concealed handguns and to shoot now, ask questions later. Fed-up citizens with firearms are exactly what America needs to be great once again.",1158624000,3,1285,5.123809523809523
91955,5,0790732300,"The film critic Pauline Kael referred to this film as a ""fascist"" film, implying that simply because a cop who was disgusted by idiotic paperwork and having to obey bureaucrats and politicians who understand nothing about the world we live in decided to take an unconventional approach to fighting crime.  Believe me, liberals like police, too.  They're not going to care about certain people's rights when it comes to having a safe neighborhood.  But then on the flip side, conservatives have never really liked civil liberties, unless they're arrested, then they want as many liberties as they can get.  I personally hate when people with political axes to grind drag a film into their idiotic little world, because they're out to prove their point, and they'll distort the meaning of the film.  It'll leave a bad taste in your mouth after you've seen it, because you've heard the verbose intellectuals talk and talk and talk and talk about it ad nauseum.  This is a great film, one of Clint's best and the best film in the Dirty Harry series.  It's intelligent, exciting, and funny as hell.  It's politically incorrect, and that's a damn good thing.  Life is politically incorrect, and that's a damn good thing also.  There are many great setpieces, such as the opening bank robbery, the speech on why they call him Dirty Harry, the scene where they shoot Scorpio, and the final scene.

91958,4,0790732300,"I'll just stick to the film itself and not go into hidden meanings and such, for now.  First Clint Eastwood(who was the best choice for this one) and Andrew Robinson are fantastic in it. The direction is very good but not great and it does have a very intense sequences(the opening and endings scenes are both great).  This is definatelty in the top five best cop movies ever and who can forget the ""six shots or only five"" line.  the dvd presentaition is pretty good but by no means fantastic.

Now on with the opinions.  First, I would never want to be a cop.  the character of Harry if nothing shows you this. He is a good cop that has been so hardened by his environment that has almost no remorse. He knows the city is a jungle and its ""kill or be killed"".  Eastwood plays him to perfection, hard and tough but also has an everyman type quality to him, he is ""real"".  Andrew Robinson is just as good as the insane psychopath Scorpio.  He is the one great ingredient the rest of the Dirty Harry movies lacked, a great bad guy.

Some people see the film as a call to fascism. I more view it as a way to understand what the life of a police officer is like, true some circumstances are exagerated, but its just a movie.  I personally like the Eastwood-Segal collaboration Escape from Alcatraz better, but Dirty Harry might be their best film because its one that makes people think the most.  It will definately make you want to talk about it.",1149292800,2,1445,4.350746268656716

Eastwood's performance as Harry Callahan is unfettered by conventional techniques and he dominates this movie, along with a psychotically perfect Andrew Robinson as the demented Scorpio Killer.  Harry is determined to stop the psycho, but when he gathers evidence without a warrant and actually tortures the suspect, Robinson is back out on the street and even more dangerous.  The first in the five Harry movies, this is one of the best of its kind.",1148947200,3,653,5.2
91960,5,0790732300,"This was the first of the always-entertaining ""Dirty Harry"" cop series and it was a good one - maybe the best of the series.

One of Harry's famous lines was in this opener: ""Do ya feel lucky, punk?"" Speaking of punks, Andy Robinson, who played the villain, never got famous as Clint Eastwood (""Harry"") certainly became but he was tremendous in this film. He didn't even have to utter a line: he just looked deranged! Great casting.

Looking back, the one thing I really appreciate about this film as opposed to the rest of them in this series was the absence of Harry's annoying superiors constantly on his case. He actually got support from his bosses in this movie.

The film as a big hit because people were already tired of all the liberal preaching of the 1960s in which we were supposed to feel sympathy for the criminal instead of the victim. This series was the side of the cops, not the crooks, which is probably why the sick film critics never liked Dirty Harry.

This is one solid crime story with no boring spots and no sappy sub-plots with romances, either. And it's always nice to enjoy theinteresting San Francisco skyline.",1146268800,6,1139,4.596059113300493

91992,5,0790732300,"Such is the assertion made boldly and impertinently by Detective Harry Callahan to the San Francisco D.A in ""Dirty Harry"", perhaps the greatest urban cop thriller ever made.  This remark, accompanied by a least a dozen others, was deemed didactic, fascist, and reactionary upon the film's original release.  And in many corners of American liberalism, the film is still thought to be screened only in either William F. Buckley's penthouse suite or on Dick Cheney's hunting trips.  This interpretation is superficial and sequacious, given that many of the film's detractors never even saw it (nothing much has changed, as witness the controversies surrounding ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""topical"" movies that are not really even about their purported topics), and that the film

offers as many reasons to hate Harry as it does reasons to applaud him.

  Such austere ambiguity can be ascribed only to the filmmaker, the inimitable Don Siegel, as taut and mature a director as Hollywood has ever produced.  Socially-minded critics have always encountered a slippery task in trying to pin

down his ideological agenda.  But when an argument is borne over  whether ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is anti-Communist or anti-McCarthyist, or if ""Coogan's Bluff"" is an indictment of New York hippiedom, the opposing sides lose sight of what is so truly great in each movie.  Similarly, ""Dirty Harry"" offers an account of a fascist policeman who, regardless of his good intentions, winds up a criminal and a vigilante.  Siegel constantly, yet subtlely alludes to the unnerving similarities between the serial killer Scorpio (Andy Robinson) and Callahan (immortalized by Clint Eastwood's feverishly laconic performance).  When his captain lectures about how these ""sickos"" relish any kind of repetition and pattern in their crimes, we can't shake the memory of Callahan's polished shtick that he recites to toy with captives who are in a position to shoot him.  There is something deeply, pathologically wrong with Harry, something that is in no means explained by his painful, yet unflinching admission of his wife's death, something that can no longer reside within the confines of the law, something...dangerous?  Well, this being a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, you betch your ass he's dangerous.",1144886400,2,2333,5.298913043478261

A film critic for my hometown newspaper, The Montreal Gazette, gave the film one star and claimed that it was ""a call for fascism."" The film was certainly a right-wing reaction against a series of ultra-liberal Supreme Court rulings that, by the early 1970s, had stacked the deck against the police and prosecutors in the United States.

Left-wing academics (whom the media refers to as ""experts"") had claimed that the Civil Rights Act, less spending on law enforcement, and more spending on social welfare programs would lead to a sharp drop in crime.  When these policies led to a crime explosion instead, there was a right-wing backlash. The film ""Dirty Harry"" served as a kind of catharsis for Americans angry over the ""social change"" and rampant crime that had been imposed on the nation by liberal elites.

Clint Eastwood plays Inspector Harry Callahan, Dirty Harry, who is assigned to investigate a serial sniper (played masterfully by Andy Robinson) who threatens to keep killing at random unless the city of San Francisco pays a ransom.  Harry eventually catches the sniper only to see him ordered released thanks to the radical criminal procedure rulings of the Supreme Court.

Played unforgettably by Clint Eastwood, the character remains one of the most memorable characters in screen history and the chord struck by his films still rings true to this day.

1971's ""Dirty Harry"" is the first of five Dirty Harry films, and to this day is still considered the best of the series by just about everyone.

A killer going by the name of Serpico (Andy Robinson) is terrorizing San Francisco, killing one person per day until his demands are met. Not willing to pay him off, the police put Deective Harry Callahan, known as Dirty Harry, in charge of the case. While everyone else views it as a routine murder case, Harry knows that Serpico is more dangerous than the average serial killer. Callahan will perform whatever is necessary to catch Serpico, even if it costs him his job - and his life. This all leads to an explosive climax involving a school bus full of screaming children and a gripping chase through the backroads of San Francisco.

""Dirty Harry"" still remains the quintessential cop thriller to this day. Its message still rings true, and the character has long been proven to not just be a product of its time.

DIRTY HARRY is a film of incredible suspense, with Donald Siegel's direction becoming a benchmark for the genre.  The movie's legacy is well documented: Sinatra, McQueen, Newman and The Duke, turned it down.  History has proved them correct.

What is now considered action film cliche's, ""Dirty Harry"" created; the tough loner cop who gets saddled with an unwanted partner, (usually a partner that is lucky to make it past the halfway point), the cop that breaks all of the rules to bring the bad guy to justice, the cop that has his superiors and city hall breathing down his neck because of his loose canon tactics. Sure..it sounds like I am describing almost any cop movie from the ""Lethal Weapon"" series or almost any Steven Seagal film...but Dirty Harry started it all, and does it so much better than the scores of imitators that followed. Also, the sniper killer storyline seems even more timely, especially to us folks in the Baltimore and DC area after the sniper killings around here from a couple years ago. As much as I enjoy Clint Eastwood's westerns, he was made to play the hard-boiled detective. Now that Eastwood is finally getting some respect from Hollywood with Oscar's and other award nominations, it's fun to go back and see his earlier films.

Tightly directed by Don Siegel, with the gritty side of San Francisco as its backdrop, Dirty Harry is the story of a cop who lives for the hunt, and captures the changes in the American criminal justice system well ahead of its time.

Harry Callahan is on the tail of Scorpio, a sick and evil serial killer, but must jump hoops over the barriers of politics and the criminal-friendly laws.  Decried by some as a fascist flick, others viewed it differently, and found the character of Callahan to be very compelling; an enforcer of justice in the wild west of the modern city.  Clint Eastwood gives one of his signature performances, and Andrew Robinson plays one of the all-time great evil psychos.

The DVD has some interesting interviews with people like Robert Urich, Hal Holbrook, Andrew Robinson and others who starred in various Dirty Harry movies, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger, who describes what a huge role model Eastwood was for him.

Even John Wayne took note of Dirty Harry's success, and created the lesser, but still eminently watchable, ""McQ"" in response.

This is not the west, folks; America is a land of civil liberties and a system..a system for law enforcement.  Do we really want a police force turned brood squad?  For every justifiable use of force, there are dozens of wrong uses (read: Rodney King, Kent State).

92021,5,0790732300,"John Milius is the greatest screenwriter you never heard of, not to mention a terrific director. He describes the ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan character as ""God's lonely man."" Milius is that rarest of rarities, a Hollywood conservative. He herein wrote a film for the Republican Clint Eastwood that spoke to the hopes and fears of an America yearning for justice, law'n'order in a world dominated by overarching liberalism in the 1960s and '70s.
Picture America at that time: Vietnam, the streets and campuses exploding in riot, and a new social ethos that was willing to blame a racist white establishment for the crimes of this nation's increasing population of criminals.
In the 1960s, the Supreme Court became activist to the hilt. The most obvious of these cases was the famous Miranda ruling from Arizona, in which a criminal was allowed to go free because he had not understood his rights, not understanding the English language spoken by the arresting officer. His subsequent confessions were thrown out. The Court spoke of the ""forbiddeen fruit"" of evidence gathered by overzealous officers who ""failed"" to inform criminals that they were being searched just before they discovered their weapons, their drugs, their evidence. A police officer who found evidence of crimes was unable to make the case unless he had probable cause ahead of time to find the evidence.
In ""Dirty Harry"", a character (Andy Robinson) based on the never-caught Zodiak killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area at that time, goes on a murder rampage. Eastwood catches him at Kezar Stadoium. A little girl is lying in a hole some place. She has a limited amount of air left. Eastwood knows the guy did it. We know it. God knows it. The scene is worth watching in light of Abu Ghraib and the concept of the ""ticking time bomb"" theory of interrogation that the terror era has brought upon us.
Eastwood knows that if the man is arrested and booked, he will not talk, hiding behind a lawyer, and that the girl will suffocate. He applies a little bit of torture to Robinson, the Scorpio killer. What he wants is to know where the little girl is, so she can be saved. Scorpio wines about having rights and wanting a lawyer. Eastwood extracts the information from him. The girl, however, has died before she can be found by the cops.
Eastwood is confronted by the D.A., who tells him not only that the killer had rights, but that he will walk as soon as he is healthy, and he has brought in a Berkeley professor to detail to Clint how he violated the criminal's rights and, in essence, is worse than the Scorpio killer.
The end? We've all seen it a million times on TBS's ""Movies For Guys Who Like Movies."" Eastwood gets his man. He receives zero gratitude from the authorities. Millions of ordinary American citizens appreciated him in theatres and TVs since then, however.

92044,2,0790732300,"Last night (3/24/04), while editing a novella I'm polishing, I watched ""Dirty Harry"" on The History Channel. THC (hmmm...) had invited John Milius, Hollywood's best-known anti-pinko fascist, and the uncredited writer of ""Dirty Harry""'s final script, to comment on the film. Which is rather like having an arsonist discuss his skill at starting fires.
""Dirty Harry"" isn't drama, it's propaganda. It isn't an intelligent consideration of the issue involved -- how do you maximize the police's ability to apprehend criminals while curtailing the legal system's tendency to trample the rights of the innocent? -- it's nothing more than an attempt to agitate its audience, for all the wrong reasons.
The plot is obvious, the characterizations crude and implausible. The villain is a sub-human degenerate anyone would loathe, the sort who, as the joke goes, murders his parents, then begs for mercy because he's an orphan. He isn't merely psychotic -- he not only enjoys killing people, but turning the law against itself. He even pays a man to beat him up and then puts the blame on Harry.
He's so impossibly evil that even the most fuzzy-headed bleeding-heart liberal would approve of Harry smashing the guy's skull to pulp with a tire iron -- and then condemn Harry for letting him off easy.
Both Harry and the audience _know_ the guy is guilty. There is no moral issue when there is no question of guilt. Harry's actions are morally (if not legally) justifiable, because they seem necessary to save someone's life, and there is no legal alternative to them.
But Harry is the ""cause"" of this particular problem, because his failure to follow proper procedures allows the villain to go free since, as the script so crudely and unsubtly states it, ""He has rights.""
The film's message is simple -- and simple-minded: If ""the justice system"" can't protect us from such obvious monsters, how it can it protect us from the less-obvious ones? It can't, of course.
Harry's contradictory nature - he wants to make the world a better place by being a cop, but doesn't want to play by the rules - is only briefly touched on. His self-inflicted ""martyrdom"" at the end (discarding his badge in a pit) is actually a veiled condemnation of the police -- what good are they when we ""need"" people like Harry to establish justice?
Milius's smirking remark that ""some people consider the film fascist,"" without contradicting the claim, shows where his feelings lie. ""Dirty Harry"" implies we should just let cops do their duty, using whatever means necessary, without restraint, and that justice is attained only when _every_ guilty person is punished, regardless of how many innocent people are swept up in the process. If that isn't fascism, I don't know what is.
Should Mr. Milius be reading this, let me explain to him _why_ the Constitution includes protection of habeas corpus, against unreasonable search and seizure, et al. It isn't to protect the criminal; it's to protect the innocent against the likes of John Milius, who would have the police do whatever was ""necessary"" to bring someone to ""justice.""
Sorry, no. I believe the best interests of society are served by occasionally letting the guilty go free.

Instead, you get law-enforcement busy with getting more money from the tax-payers (with fines for jay-walking or not using your safety-belt in your car), so they can afford the cost of useless trials, followed by expensive welfare for the custody of those who spend their lives taking lifes and/or property from the same tax-payers. Just compare the cost of one bullet versus the cost of gas/electricity chambers (yet, executions are much cheaper than 20 years in jail).
Maybe more people should remember that the Polikally-Korrekt generating crap like Miranda's is the same PK presiding the McCarthy's courts, the Hays' code for movies, or, a bit more remote in History: the 'saint' Inquisition; but, at least, the Inquisition was not as perverted as the P.K., since they didn't require cops risking to be killed while enforcing the rights of the perpetrators.

92050,5,0790732300,"This is the first of five ""Dirty Harry"" films in which Eastwood stars as a San Francisco police detective. By the time the last appeared (The Dead Pool, in 1988), Eastwood had aged and times had changed but Callahan's values and methods remained essentially the same. When initially released, Dirty Harry was immediately controversial as was Death Wish (1974). Audiences tended to be divided between those who were offended by what they considered to be excessive violence and those who (like Harry Callahan and Paul Kersey) had lost confidence in society's willingness and/or ability to respond effectively to violent crime. After seeing each of the two films for the first time, I vividly recall joining those around me in the theatre as they rose and cheered...and continue to applaud for several minutes. I asked myself, ""What's going on here? What's this all about?""
At least in the larger U.S. cities 30 years ago, residents had become totally fed up with traditional law enforcement initiatives. It was no longer safe to walk the streets at night. Even more dangerous to do so in public parks. Homes were robbed while people worked during the day. Many of the same homes were robbed again later after insurance coverage replaced the articles previously stolen. Racial animosities, drug abuse, and a widespread contempt for institutional authority all contributed to such problems.
Under Don Siegel's crisp direction, Eastwood and his associates in the cast bring R.M. Fink's screenplay to life (and yes, to death) as they focus on what is obviously an irreconcilable conflict between Callahan and his superiors who include the mayor of San Francisco. Callahan's motto seems to be ""Whatever it takes."" In some situations, it may take his 44 Magnum, ""the most powerful handgun in the world.""  Callahan has not totally lost faith in his society nor in the importance of the legal system. However, he does feel betrayed. The mayor and even Lieutenant Bressler (Harry Guardino) just don't ""get it."" This is precisely the same point Jim Malone (Sean Connery) makes to Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) in The Untouchables 26 years later: When orthodox (""by the book"") crime-fighting strategies and tactics don't succeed, use others even if they are not (at least technically) legal. Countless other films (such as Magnum Force, The French Connection, and L.A. Confidential) also make the same point.
It is important to remember when seeing this film again, as I did recently, that it portrays elements of an urban society few of us ever experience. Also, that it is a drama, not a documentary. Its primary purpose is to tell a story. The plot focuses on a serial killer named ""Scorpio"" (Andy Robinson) whom Callahan is determined to eliminate. Even when he eventually does so, questions remain. Don't criminals also have rights? What would happen if all or most other detectives followed Callahan's example? To what extent (if any) should private citizens also be actively involved in law enforcement? I agree with several critics who claim that, with Dirty Harry, Siegel and Eastwood created a new film genre. Its influence proved to be substantial. Each viewer must decide for herself or himself how much social relevance it has retained after 32 years but almost everyone would agree that it has lost little of its entertainment value.",1065398400,89,3332,5.08029197080292

92072,5,0790732300,"The first of five Dirty Harry movies was definitely the best in the series.  By the 1970's, there was a growing frustration on how light criminals were getting punished.  True, the police were doing their jobs, but certain judges were doling out lenient sentences.
Dirty Harry is an angry response to the increasing crime rate exacerbated by judicial incompetence, and that was something expanded in the second movie, Magnum Force.  The sobering opening scene has the camera panning down the lengthy plaque listing members of the SFPD killed on duty.
Harry Callahan's first onscreen case involves tracking down a demented serial killer named Scorpio, who during the opening credits, aims a high-powered rifle from a rooftop and kills a girl in a swimming pool.  A note demands the City of San Francisco to pay him $100,000 or else he will kill either a Catholic priest or a black, and he uses the six letter N-word too.  Harry is assigned Gonzalez, a young Latino who Harry is initially indifferent to due to his previous partners ending up in the hospital or worse.
One noteworthy sequence involves Harry introducing crooks to his weapon of choice.  He gives them this memorable spiel:  ""I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya punk?E You tell'em, Harry!  Another bit of memorable dialogue involves Harry explaining to the mayor why he thought a man intended to assault a female:  ""When a naked man is chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher's knife and a h*****n, I figure he isn't out collecting for the Red Cross! E
One goof is the route a bus takes on the Golden Gate Bridge.  Presumably, the intended destination is Santa Rosa, where there's an airport, but why take the turnoff at San Quentin and Sir Francis Drake Blvd., in the opposite direction, where there's no airport?  I say this because I used to live in the area.
The movie also forces an examination of the Miranda Rights and other legal empowerment afforded to the ordinary citizen.  The concept of evidence being inadmissible because of bureaucratic slip-ups may have been used to enforce the Fourth Amendment and to prevent law enforcement officials from abusing their office or persecuting individuals.  However, when there's a clear case of a criminal being guilty before arrest and law enforcement jumps the gun on the paperwork, does that justify the wheels of the law juddering to a halt, the results of which any evidence gathered prior to a warrant is discounted?
Dirty Harry has several things going for it.  One is Clint Eastwood's laconic look, that trademark narrowed squint, and the title character's general disdain for bureaucrats as well as being a crack shot and being intelligent.  Another is Lalo Schifrin's music, which captures the mood of the lively action scenes down to the sobering notes at the film's denouement.

A rooftop serial sniper is terrorizing San Francisco and sends a letter to the mayor, threatening to kill homosexuals or negroes if his demands aren't met. He kidnaps a young girl and unfortunately she dies. He sends her teeth through the mail to verify that he has her.
This movie was inspired by the zodiac killings of the sixties and if you read the book Zodiac it verifies that. I had figured that out before I read the book. Another connection is that Scorpio, the serial killer in Dirty Harry, played by Andrew Robinson,is a sign of the Zodiac which is another indication that Dirty Harry was inspired by these killings.
Also when you watch this movie you can see what inspired Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon to write the scene where the lead characters tries to talk a man out of committing suicide on top of a roof. The same thing happens in Dirty Harry.
This movie was written with Frank Sinatra as Dirty Harry but I can't imagine that Sinatra would have played him as Eastwood did. Eastwood was good in playing Harry tough. Can I imagine Sinatra playing Dirty Harry? Maybe. But he certainly wouldn't have been as good. The part wouldn't have suited him as much as Eastwood because I believe that Eastwood can play tough better.
When Harry meets the killer at the end after jumping off a bridge onto a school bus full of kidnapped children (another scene inspired by the ravings of the Zodiac killer)he asks him,""Do you feel lucky?"" He must have. He went for his gun but he run out of luck.",1047686400,,1605,4.537931034482758
92076,5,0790732300,"This movie is one of the best. They don't come any smoother than ol' Harry Callahan. My favorite part is when Scorpio spots him standing on top of the bridge waiting for him. Harry definitely looks like a force to be reckoned with there. The music in this movie is very good as well. I can't think of a movie with a more intense beginning scene. I also enjoy the bank robbery scene when Harry yells out ""halt!"" and pieces of hot dog fly out of his mouth. It doesn't get any better than that.",1046476800,,491,4.178947368421053
92077,5,0790732300,"What Dirty Harry did to revolutionize the 'cop drama' as well as the social statement it made about America in the 70s can fill volumes. But I suppose this isn't the place for an academic lecure. So let's just say this is a great movie. There is a reason everyone loves it. It's well written, well acted, and an all around great film. And some of our most memorable quotes come from this film.
""I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya punk?""
The dvd contains no commentary, but it does have two documentary featurettes on it. One is from 1971, which is pretty much worthless. The other is a longer documentary which really delves into Harry Callahan (not just _Dirty Harry_). There is also an extensive 'Interview Gallery'. It's a great dvd for a great movie.",1045094400,3,1048,4.435233160621761

THANKS TO DON SIEGEL AND JOHN MILIUS THIS WAS AN INSTANT CLASSIC.
AS MUCH AS I LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD AND HIS FILMS, THIS ONE STANDS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST.
MEET HARRY CALLAHAN, A LACONIC LONER WITH NOTHING TO GO HOME TOO EXCEPT HIS SMITH AND WESSON MODEL 29 .44 MAGNUM.
BODIES ARE TURNING UP ALL OVER SAN FRANCISCO AND CALLAHAN IS ASSIGNED THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE CRIMES. AS A POLICE DEPT. INSPECTOR, HE IS NOTORIOUS FOR 'GETTING IT DONE'
AND ""TAKING EVERY DIRTY JOB THAT COMES ALONG."" THUS THE MONIKER 'DIRTY HARRY'
CALLAHAN IS TEAMED WITH A NEW PARTNER WHO HE IS SLOW TO APPRECIATE. AND TOWARDS THE END THE ROOKIE DETECTIVE FINDS LIFE WITH HARRY JUST A LITTLE MORE THEN HE BARGAINED FOR.
OUR INTRODUCTION TO HARRY HAS HIM FOILING A BANK ROBBERY WHILE EATING A HOT DOG. HIS MUSHED CRY OF ""HALT!' FALLS ON DEAF EARS SO HE PROCEEDS TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH THE ONLY WAY HE KNOWS HOW.
AFTER BLOWING AWAY THE BAD GUYS HE APPROACHES A WOUNDED BANDIT WHO IS CONTEMPLATING REACHING FOR HIS DROPPED SHOTGUN.
""I KNOW WHAT YER THINKIN."" STARTS CALLAHAN WITH A CASUAL GRIN.
""DID HE FIRE SIX SHOTS OR ONLY FIVE? WELL TO TELL YA THE TRUTH IN ALL THIS EXCITEMENT IVE KINDA LOST TRACK MYSELF. BUT BEIN THIS IS THE .44 MAGNUM, THE MOST POWERFUL HANDGUN IN THE WORLD AND COULD BLOW YOUR HEAD CLEAN OFF. YOUVE GOT TO ASK YERSELF ONE QUESTION, DO I FEEL LUCKY? WELL DO YA PUNK?

'CLICK.' EMPTY!
THE BANDIT BREATHS A SIGH OF RELIEF, AS HARRY WALKS AWAY CHUCKLING. HE IS NOT A SADIST JUST THE ENFORCER.
THE GUN IS AS MUCH A CHARACTER IN THIS FILM AS HARRY OR SCORPIO, THE PSYCHOTIC KILLER WHO HOLDS THE CITY FOR RANSOM WHILE HE GLEEFULLY MURDERS HIS FELLOW MAN. ANDREW ROBINSON WHO PORTRAYS SCORPIO HASNT HAD A ROLE SINCE TO MATCH THIS ONE.
DIRTY HARRY IS A HUNT, IN THE METROPOLIS OF THE GOLDEN GATE CITY.
IT ENDS WITH A REPRIMANDED CALLAHAN CORNERING THE KILLER NEAR A MINE OF SOME SORT. THE SHOWDOWN HAS AN INJURED SCORPIO REACHING FOR HIS STOLEN P-38. HARRY REPEATS HIS CLASSIC SPEECH FROM THE EARLIER ROBBERY SCENE, BUT WITH MUCH MORE INTENSITY.
THE KILLER LAUGHS HYSTERICLY AND LUNGES FOR THE PISTOL. KABOOOM!
HE IS SHOT THROUGH AND THROUGH AS HARRYS FISTED GUN BUCKS SKYWARD IN RECOIL. SCORPIOS CORPSE CASCADES INTO A LAKE AND THE HUNT IS OVER.
BUT HARRY HAS DEFIED HIS POLITICALLY CORRECT SUPERIORS AND KNOWS HIS COP DAYS ARE OVER. HE SKIPS HIS BADGE ACROSS THE POND AND WALKS AWAY AS THE CAST ROLLS.
OF COURSE HE RETURNS IN FOUR SEQUELS, BUT NONE HAVE THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THIS PIECE. IN A WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT THERE, BUT FANS WANTED MORE AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

92079,5,0790732300,"I mean in the viewer, not the film. When I first saw this film in theaters I was a cliche flower-power poseur who used the word ""pig"" to refer to a policeman, even though I'd never come up against one as a suspect. I knew Hitler's ""Law and Order"" speech by heart. After all, what was some uniformed dude who wouldn't let The People do everything and anything we felt like doing but a stormtrooper? Power to the People, Right On! But as a hippie, I was a fraud--my own law and order ethos from watching ""Dragnet"" as a kid was then and still is in place. I'm a steady viewer of Dick Wolf's crime dramas today. I guess that was why I went to see this film originally. I never cared for westerns, but Clint Eastwood doing a cop flick? Far out, man--where's it showing? I guess the difference is that I no longer hold the spoiled-brat attitude about the law I did three decades ago. If you want a clue as to who still hasn't outgrown it, listen for the term ""fascist"" and ""vigilante"" to describe films like this. I personally know people who talk like that, totally in denial of the fact that they aren't as safe from crime today as they were back then. And you don't have to live in a city as big as San Francisco anymore to be fair game for society's human predators. It scares me, you know? Every so often I recall the scene in this movie where the killer is about to walk due to police brutality questions. The DA has called Harry on the carpet, blaming him for the charges being dropped. Harry warns him that once the killer is on the street, the killings will resume. The DA asks Harry what makes him so sure. ""Because he LIKES it""; Harry tells him bluntly. Sadly, that's about the least-accepted theory on crime, as well as one of the best. But the fact that I got off on this flick so many years ago gave me no clue as to how it would stand the test of time. The ""44 Magnum"" speech--made by Harry at two completely different junctures in the film--has taken its place in cinematic history, alongside quotes by Bogart, Cagney and The Duke. Impressionists do ""what if Eastwood was..."" scenarios, based on how he talked as Dirty Harry. When I first heard about him playing a photographer in ""Bridges Of Madison County"", I dusted off my own Dirty Harry imitation and had him saying ""watch the birdie"". Or ""I know what you're thinking--did he take 15 exposures or only 12?"" But one of my favorite parts of the story is how Harry's rookie partner asks him; ""Why do they call you Dirty Harry?"" A few scenes later the pair are called to the scene of an attempted suicide. The firemen run him up in a cherry picker to where the jumper is perched on a ledge. Harry's flippancy about what will happen when the guy hits the ground first grosses him out, then infuriates him--""why, you...!"", and he goes for Harry's throat. Which gives Harry the opportunity to slap a hold on him and they are lowered to the pavement. He then comments drily to the younger officer; ""Now you know why they call me Dirty Harry--every dirty job that comes along."" Think about it. A whole new slant on how to deal with a potential suicide--divert his attention away from killing himself by making him want to kill you instead.",1043280000,4,3195,4.380471380471381

Of course, Harry knows he's guilty and the viewer knows he guilty and he's low life scum.  So what is the answer?  Give him 200,000 bucks and a plane ride to wherever he wants to go?  Not the way Harry sees it.  This guy has been a thorn in Harry's side throughout the whole movie and he's not going to get away with it.

92082,5,0790732300,"""Dirty Harry"" (1971), as an action film, is quite unique and definitely in the upper echelon of the genre. The reasons for its success, on a purely technical level, can be found in the direction, cinematography, and editing ( the latter maximizing the laser like focus of the plotline ).
San Francisco, as many times as it has been used as a film site, is showcased spectacularly. Director Don Siegel's excellent work is a model of how to maximize the potential of location shooting.
Lalo Schifrin's haunting musical score fits the film like a glove.
With regard to acting, Clint Eastwood ( with typically effective subtlety ) gives just enough hints of Inspector Harry Callahan's interior life (a widower, wearily independent detective, sympathetic to the ""common"" man ) to allow the viewer to fill in the rest of the details. ""Less is more"", while a clich, does accurately describe the minimalist style with which Eastwood brings substance to the character.
The main storyline is extremely focused ( no distracting subplots ), the action sequences displaying a practically unrivalled tension ( e.g., the dizzying cross-town rush with Callahan as ""bag man"" carrying ransom for a kidnapped teenager ). Andrew Robinson, as the killer ""Scorpio"" ( obviously modeled on the uncaught  ""Zodiac"" murderer c. 1970 )  animates one of the most evil characters in film history. We know nothing of his name or background; he functions anonymously, a destroying plague killing randomly and effectively hidden in the midst of urban society. In a chilling and critically important scene ( an effective emblem of ironic ""displacement"" ) ""Scorpio"" wears a belt buckle modeled as a ""peace sign"" while smilingly looking over a playground full of the same kinds of children he has recently murdered.
Since it is so often brought up, it is proper to spend a few moments on certain ""political"" objections raised about the film. Many reviewers continue to parrot the notion that ""Dirty Harry"" is a ""fascist"" film ( this accusation was first implied by the late film critic Pauline Kael ). The film was stamped ""Nixonian"" in a jibe clearly designed to label it as siding with the ""oppressors"" ( ""law and order"" campaign themes ) against the ( typically unquestioned ) revolutionary purity of ""the people"". To this day various ""anointed"" critics tend to regurgitate this line as if it were actually true, revealing ( among other things ) an unfortunate tendency to reduce every element of human life to the realm of politics. To this reviewer, such attacks reflect an attitude stemming from an affliction once termed ""radical chic"", a condition common to a certain class of intellectuals. Valid criticism should be directly linked to the content of the movie ( citing specifics ), not relying on half-baked media generalizations. And as far as the term ""fascist"" goes, George Orwell long ago noted the essential meaningless to which this word had already been reduced through repeated misapplication ( in a fate that has since befallen many other words, ""fascist"" is now commonly used to batter into silence those who dissent from a given line of thought ). On the most basic level, Harry Callahan is concerned with the innocent victims of violent crime, who were ( and are ) often denied justice due to legal machinations ( ""penumbras"" ) applied by monomaniacal civil libertarians whose self-proclaimed concern for ""rights"" is often a canard betraying a fatefully flawed  ( not bearing the light of reason ) allegiance to an unconstrained ideological ""vision"".
To conclude: ""Dirty Harry"" is a brilliant action film. If excitement is all one needs, the film delivers in spectacular fashion. If one wishes to ""probe"" further, it also works as a ( humble ) meditation on our ""fallen"" world and ( necessarily ) imperfect human justice.",1029024000,5,3807,5.030110935023772
92083,5,0790732300,"Dirty Harry is credited with reinvigorating the police crime drama.  Eastwood is the quintessential no-nonsense cop who values common sense above procedure.  Andy Robinson was picked by the director from an off-Broadway production where he was continually falling down the stairs.  When he auditioned, he was covered with bruises.  They figured that was dedication.  The DVD doesn't offer many extras which is probably too much to expect these many years after its initial release.  It does offer some print commentary about how the film was written for Sinatra and turned down by Newman as well as interesting tidbits about the locations.  ""Dirty Harry"" is a suspense picture, building to the final climaxes steadily.  The body count is about 6 or 7 in the picture; so it is not a bloodbath.  The scenes with Hot Mary and in the strip club offer flashes of T&A, tame these decades later, but still giving the sleazy flavor.  Eastwood makes the picture one you'll want in your collection.  When the mayor asks him what he's been doing about the crime, he quips, ""I've been sitting on my ass for the last 45 minutes waiting for you.""  It's worth checking out again!",1026086400,5,1164,4.852791878172589
92084,4,0790732300,"The San Francisco of 1971 was a city ruled by the police during the day, but by the crazies at night.  In an age that pre-dates 'political correctness,' DIRTY HARRY asks the audience to decide which is the greater evil: to tolerate the continued exitence of crime by obeying all the cumbersome niceities of the law that get in the way of police efficiency or to crush crime by bending the law when the police deem a bending necessary.  Clint Eastwood plays Harry Callahan as a man who enforces the law in a way that supporters of the later DEATH WISH would applaud.  He punctuates his methods of crime busting by getting in the last word with the bad guys.  In one memorable scene involving a bank robbery gone bad, Harry shoots a robber, then dares him to go for his dropped weapon and laughs at him for not doing so.  'Make my day,' he taunts.  Andy Robinson plays the psycho killer Scorpio, who kills and writes notes to the mayor, demanding money to stop.  The mayor, much to Harry's disgust, caves in and agrees to pay, causing Harry to stop Scorpio on his own.  The bulk of the movie and its debate over the ethics of Dirty Harry type law enforcement revolve around the continuing confrontation between Harry and Scorpio, a confrontation that director Don Siegel makes clear is but a symbol for a deeper conflict between establishing a sanctioned law and order and paying a price for that law and order.  These scenes between Harry and Scorpio are chilling in their brutality.  Scorpio breaks the law and brags that Harry can do nothing but obey the law while he can break it with impunity.  There are two scenes of note that relate to this conflict.  The first merely symbolizes it while the second sanctions it.  In this first scene, Scorpio has kidnapped a young girl and placed her in a box which does not contain enough air for her to survive.  If Harry follows proper police procedure, then she will certainly die.  He does not, instead torturing him to force him to reveal her location.  Ironically enough, she dies anyway.  In the second scene which closes the movie, Harry realizes that his brand of law enforcement can no longer be overlooked.  In disgust, he throws his badge into a river. The movie ends with a message that crime and its Dirty Harry type supression is more important than law and its proper and sometimes inefficient use of that suppression. A sad but unspoken subtext is that society is capable of promoting only two types of crime: the crime that scruffy criminals like Scorpio do when they go wilding and the sort that uniformed types like Harry commit in response. Neither is acceptable, but I fear that a third choice based on modern and more efficient crime prevention got lost in the movie's descent into and glorification of brutality.",1025654400,2,2778,4.634693877551021
92085,4,0790732300,"Dirty Harry was and remains a landmark in American film, the best-known assertion of the right to uphold the law when liberal politics and revolving-door justice pervert the law. Some called the film fascist at the time, a typically muddleheaded view that deliberately misunderstood SFPD Detective Inspector Harry Callahan.
They call him Dirty Harry because he takes the dirty jobs that come along, such as roughly talking down a belligerent suicide attempt and also blasting four bankrobbers who interrupt his hotdog lunch, goading one (Albert Popwell) by hinting the Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum revolver he's carrying may or may not be out of ammo.  Harry, having seen previous partner Fanducci killed and most recent partner Dietrich hospitalized, also initially doesn't cotton to the young new partner he's been saddled with, but Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) nonetheless establishes the bond necessary for working detective teams.
The case Harry and Chico are assigned is to track down Scorpio (Andrew Robinson, who was briefly considered genuinely psychotic because of the sheer believability he imbued in the role), a hippie who uses a sniper rifle to kill a beautiful young woman in her penthouse pool.  After shooting the girl he sends a ransom note for $100,000 or else he'll kill selected victims. The Mayor of the city (John Vernon) is reluctant to see particular harm come to Scorpio, as he is unhappy with Callahan's previous crime-fighting forays - shown in the famous ""That's my policy"" exchange between Harry and the Mayor early on.
Director Don Siegel and his cinematographers use the subtleties of circa-1971 San Francisco to extract powerfully effective stylization as well as gritty, realistic tension in the flow of the plot, such as when Harry and Chico stake out the church of a threatened priest and a gunfight erupts with Scorpio.  When the killer escapes (killing a policeman in the process), he takes a pre-pubescent girl hostage and Harry must pay the ransom, but Harry has Chico surreptitiously tail him and Scorpio is seriously inujured at the drop, but so is Chico. Harry teams with Frank DiGeorgio and they track down Scorpio at Kezar Stadium; Harry shoots Scorpio and tortures confession out of him - by which time the girl is already dead.
Because of Harry's conduct snooty DA Bill Rothko (Josef Summer), using a liberal judge as a second opinion, throws out prosecution of Scorpio, this even though the rifle used in the killings matches up in ballistics.  A furious Harry warns that Scorpio will kill again - and the resourceful punk even gets himself beaten up to try and frame Harry.  He then robs a liquor store and takes a schoolbus hostage - and with official San Francisco ready to cave in to Scorpio, Harry disgustedly takes on the killer himself.
The film ends with the most discussed scene of the entire Dirty Harry series - ashamed that the department he serves seems no longer concerned with upholding the law, Harry throws his badge into a creek and walks off (a brilliant long-range shot by Siegel).  As Harry of course returns to filmdom, this act is obviously overlooked by the department - an admission to themselves, perhaps, that Harry was right all along.",1020816000,,3209,5.0
92086,4,0790732300,"Clint Eastwood is probably responsible for more catch-phrases then any other actor ever, but the majority of those phrases come from the Dirty Harry movies. Several people feel this film is politically incorrect in several ways, but keep in mind this film was made before politically correct was being used as a phrase. This film is not the best crime picture ever but I believe its one of the best.
Eastwood plays Detective Harry Callahan on the San Fransico Police Dept. He handles cases in a very violent way, which could be construed as unesesary but it is a classic Eastwood action film, and what is an action film without it's fair share of violence?
To me the two best things about this movie is the cinematography and the ending. The camera in this film makes you feel like you are behind Dirty Harry the entire duration of the film. The ending is very well done but I won't give it away.
Not to be poltically incorrect but this is kind of a ""guy movie"" to a certain degree. Harry is a no-nonsense rogue cop that is not bashful when it comes to pulling the trigger or roughing up a suspect. The [$] price is well worth this Clint Eastwood masterpiece, if you can wade through Harry's body count without being offended.",1018051200,3,1226,4.527027027027027
92087,4,0790732300,"Action-Packed this movie definitely is.  Clint Eastwood delivers his own brand of justice in tracking down a serial killer to plagues the city of San Fransisco.

However, Robinson to hijack a bus full of school children and Dirty Harry spots the opening and tracks his man down.  Was it five shots or six, but Mr. Robinson sure was not too lucky.
Whereas Clint Eastwood was his usual striking self, Robinson fit the role of the villain like a hand in a glove.  Robinson's character really made you want to hate him and therefore the film as a whole stands out from others in the Dirty Harry series.",1010102400,,769,4.625

On the plus side the set comes with a generous amount of eye candy - a set of black and white stills, reproductions of the lobby card set, a reprint of the original one sheet, and a framable picture with a splice of actual 35mm film the picture was taken from.  On the down side the disc itself is nothing unique.  A trailer, some production notes, and the film either full frame or widescreen.  No commentary from Eastwood?  Sadly the transfer is nothing to write home about.  There is a tremendous amount of grain in the night scenes and the 2:35:1 aspect ratio is cropped, the sides are missing (shoulders are cut off, as is the first letter of police officers names scrolling at the beginning, also the marquee with Play Misty for Me is likewise halved) and the tops of heads are cut off.  Dirty Harry is a landmark police thriller, one of the very best (which is why I still give this classic 5 stars instead of docking it a point or two on principal for the horrible picture quality), too bad that this classic movie didn't get a little more special treatment for this 'special' edition.",1009152000,,1108,4.455445544554456
92089,5,0790732300,"On any level, large or small, the desire to see justice done in universal.  Many will contend that it is more pronounced in the wake of a significant emotional experience, but in the final analysis, it's a craving with parameters of neither time nor place; a hunger that demands to be satiated.  And in our tumultuous times and world, that longing for justice too often goes unsatisfied, and occasionally it's gratifying to get a taste of it, if only through the magic of the movies.  Which is exactly what you get with ""Dirty Harry,"" directed by Don Siegel, in which star Clint Eastwood introduces one of-- if not the-- most memorable characters of his long and varied career, the iconoclastic veteran San Francisco detective, Harry Callahan.
 In his many years on the job, Callahan has seen it all up close and suffered personal loss, as well; so much so that he is committed to doing the right thing, even if it means discarding all the rules and proceeding as he sees fit-- playing by his own rules, as it were.  In his eyes, there's the law, and then there's justice-- and he is determined that the latter shall prevail at any cost.  Which is the lesson a psychotic killer (Andrew Robinson) is about to learn when he picks Callahan to play a game of cat-and-mouse with; a game that involves the life of a young girl he has kidnapped and is threatening to kill unless Harry jumps through some hoops of his own demented design for him.  And by the time it's over, there are lessons learned, to be sure.  Everything may not turn out happily ever after, but rest assured, before the credits roll, justice will have been served.  Dirty Harry style.
 Siegel has crafted and delivered an emotionally involving drama that makes you feel the frustration and anger of being defiled without recompense, at the hands of one of the cinema's most heinous villains ever.  Siegel presents his antagonist in such a way that very quickly he becomes a truly loathsome character who is almost unbearable to watch at times.  He is so vile, in fact, that by the time Callahan draws a bead on him you want nothing more than to see him throttled from one side of the screen to the other.  As in real life, however, things do not necessarily proceed as you would like, and you may find yourself gnashing your teeth in mounting frustration as the killer eludes Callahan's grasp time and again.  But as you're biting off yet another fingernail, keep in mind that in the end, justice is visited.
 Dirty Harry Callahan is the character, it seems, that Clint Eastwood was born to play.  The attitude, the nuance and the eye for detail he brings to this role makes Callahan unique and memorable.  This is a character onto which you can project your own frustrations and sensibilities, which enables you to share not only his sense of futility, but his satisfaction as Harry ultimately metes out the justice it seems the whole world is in need of by the end of the movie.  And it's a satisfaction you will carry with you out of the theater, or beyond the confines of your own living room.  There's a depth to Eastwood's portrayal that gives you some clues as to what it is that really makes Callahan tick, but at the same time he only lets you in so far, so that by the end there is still a bit of mystery behind the man.  And even now, some thirty years after this film was made, Harry Callahan emerges as the definitive anti-hero for our times, which serves as an indication of just how strong this performance by Eastwood is.  It is, without question, one of his best.
 There's no mystery, however, to the fact that Andrew Robinson gives an extraordinary performance here as the killer.  He is so despicable, in fact, that one has to wonder if this part perhaps had an adverse affect on his career.  On a personal note, I know that for years afterward I couldn't stand to see Robinson in anything, because no matter what part he was playing I could not get past his persona as the killer in this film.  A good example is the 1973 film ""Charlie Varrick,"" which is an excellent movie (also directed by Siegel), but one I would not be able to appreciate until years later because Robinson's presence was simply too overwhelming.  In retrospect, it says a lot about his ability as an actor; that he could leave such an indelible impression with a single portrayal is certainly indicative of his talent.
 The supporting cast includes Harry Guardino (Bressler), Reni Santoni (Chico), John Vernon (The Mayor), John Larch (Chief), John Mitchum (De Georgio), Mae Mercer (Mrs. Russell), Lun Edgington (Norma) and Ruth Kobart (Bus Driver).  Backed with a terrific score by Lalo Schifrin, ""Dirty Harry"" is a hard-hitting, extremely emotionally involving film (especially for one of this genre) that will get your blood pumping in any number of directions at the same time.  It's escapist fare, to be sure, but it hits so close to home that it is both disconcerting and ultimately fulfilling.  Definitely one you're going to remember.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1007856000,3,5034,4.6478555304740405

Unfortunately, there's still one feature that hasn't changed that I wish was different: Warner Bros. still using cardboard snap cases instead of plastic keep cases like every other studio uses nowadays! I know I've been beating this particular point to death in my previous reviews of Warner-released DVDs, but still! I'm willing to pay a few more cents for a more durable covering for my discs, and I'm sure many others are as well. So, get to it already!
Also included on the re-release are a few documentaries. The first one, a half-hour retrospective hosted by `Magnum Force' co-star Robert Urich, features the history of the Dirty Harry saga as it unfolded over two decades and five movies. Includes snippets of memories by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Andy Robinson (Scorpio) from the first `DH', Hal Holbrook from `Magnum Force', Evan Kim & Patricia Clarkson from `The Dead Pool', and ol' Clint himself. Robinson, probably better known nowadays as the Cardassian tailor/spy Garak on `Star Trek: DS9"", discusses how rich he'd be today if he had a dollar for every time someone came up to him and recited the infamous ""Do you feel lucky?"" line to him. Of course, this is not counting the fortune he'd have if he had a buck for every time a Trekkie asks him to hem a pair of Starfleet uniform trousers. Another useless Andrew Robinson tidbit: he's probably the only actor to get `beat up' by two famous action-movie stars (he was also `punched out' by Sylvester Stallone at the end of `Cobra').
Speaking of ""getting lucky"", if you've seen all of the Unclean Harold flicks, you're probably wondering why that one surviving bank robber looks so familiar. Well, it's probably due to the fact that he has small roles in each of the first four movies, each time playing a different character. Strangely enough, he's nowhere to be seen in `The Dead Pool'. An insidious Hollywood conspiracy, perhaps? Naaahhh....
Anyway, lemme get back to the other features. There's the other doc, a seven-minute look at past cop-action flicks and their comparisons & contrasts to `Dirty Harry'. Also included is a theatrical trailer, which is pretty much an obligatory extra for most movie DVDs nowadays. But the weird thing is, this particular trailer ran for over three minutes, and much of it tried to show Harry's softer side. Sheesh, if I wanted to see someone's softer side, I'd just rent some insipid romantic comedy, okay? C'mon, give me some meaty exit wounds & stuff if you really want me to watch the acual movie! But, then again, it might've been done as a ploy to bring in the ladies. Hey, when you're marketing a flick, you gotta bring in the widest demographic possible, you know?

Scorpio is after what most bad guys are after: money, if he doesn't get it, someone will die. Harry reluctantly finds himself partnered with Mexican cop Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni)to catch the killer.

Because of his un-PC dialogue it is assumed he is a bigot.  Because he defends himself and others with a S&W Model 29 .44 Magnum he is written off as a psychotic.  And so on.  As his hispanic partner points out, he is called ""Dirty Harry"" because he gets the worst assignments.  Only the most pitiful, mewling moral weakling would consider this film an advertisement for fascism.  It is an indictment of the weakening and -- far worse -- bureaucritization of law enforcement, of its growing concern with appearance over protecting the public.  And, of course, a great flick.
The film makes plain that while he describes his vulgar world in vulgar terms, he is actually above it.  We learn from the beginning of the film that his doctor, who he chats up with more warmth than his white bosses, is black.  Remember, in 1971 it was still commonplace to just write off blacks as ""monkeys"" or worse.  The idea of a black man being a doctor, period, was unusual... let alone a white man seeing him for medical care and considering him his equal.
It is cues like these that reveal the true heart of the picture.  So many soft-handed worryworts miss the point of the film because they do not understand the CONTEXT.  The film is full of signs that Dirty Harry is an egalitarian in a time (1971) where such a point of view was rarer than it is now.  Dirty Harry says the word ""Spic"" and a certain class of people are all aflutter, even as he embraces (insomuch as he embraces ANYTHING) his hispanic partner and his black doctor, and is enraged by the murder of a black, and so on ad infinitum.  Yet, of course, he is a racist and a fascist.  Idiotic.

92145,4,0790732300,"Harry Callaghan (a grand Irish name!) is dirty Harry, a tough, mean cop dealing with brutal criminals, in an uncomprimising way!  Dirty Harry is everything early seventies cops were all about:  he goes through partners at a rate of several a month, he's a weird loner, doesn't care for himself or authority, he just wants to get the bad guys by the most direct route possible.
Rights?  Criminals don't have rights! And he applies this philosophy in a harsh, sadistic manner.  He's as hard as nails, tougher than shoe leather, he growls out his lines through gritted teeth ""I know what you're thinking, was it five bullets or six?  But given that this is a magnum 44 that'll blow your head clean off, the question you gotta ask yourself is this:  Do I feel lucky?  Well, do ya, punk?""...or words to that effect.  He's basically a good, intelligent cop, but with no time for the niceties of procedure.
The story is of a psychopath holding various people hostage for ransom money from the city.  Harry closes in, using illegal and unethical methods, and gets his man.  But his illegal methods return to haunt him, so what does Harry do?  Well you'll have to watch the film.  The story line is gripping, and it'll keep you interested all the way.  There are plenty of twists and turns, lots of action, drama, and tragedy.
But what is really good about this film is the cinematography.  This film was made in 1971, and the techniques used are quite dated, but give the film a real feel and atmosphere for the time.  The camera shots tended to move with  Harry as he walked along, they would pan around a bit shakily, following him from car, up steps, and into building.  The sound effects were fab: every shoe step can be clearly heard, even on concrete!  Harry goes into police HQ.  What happens?  A phone rings - that typical early seventies ring, a kind of aural signal that he's in a busy, hardworking office.  (Every time anyone goes into a building with offices, a phone somewhere in the background rings. Its amazing!)  Lots of other sounds are louder than they should be, in keeping with film-making style at the time: people's breathing was clearly audible, especially on the phone, gunshots were loud and clear, the noise of fist hitting jaw, body hitting ground - the sound was stark and unadorned.
The whole style of the film was minimalist, realistic, no frills, bleak, plain, colourless.  This is not a feel-good film, this is a film about violence, death, sadism, fear, crime and retribution.  When you see this film, you'll see the genesis of all the 70's cop shows that this style spawned - Kojak and  Streets of San Francisco for example - all had that gritty, realistic feel about them, sometimes happy endings, sometimes not, plenty of dodgy police behaviour, brutality, etc.
In view of the above, the film probably sounds a bit depressing.  And, in fact it is, but then sometimes life is, isn't it?  It can't all be sweetness and light, and this film shows you some of the other side.  Truly, a classic of its time!",971654400,4,3031,4.6360225140712945
92146,5,0790732300,"""Dirty Harry"" on the surface might appear to be one cop's determination to bend or even perhaps break the law in order to bring down a villainous murder terrorizing the city of San Francisco. And it succeeds in doing just that. But the film goes deeper than that, and this is what I find most compellingly interesting about it. It is the first police drama of its time to raise pertinent questions/issues regarding its ""socially redeeming value"", for example. Is this the kind of cop we want on our police force in cities all over America? Is he a killing machine who shoots first then asks questions later or does he do his job conscientously even though at times, he needs to carry it out with a certain degree of recklesseness. Harry Callahan, I think, is the latter. He is a skilled and intuitive detective who is fed up with the police bureaucracy that, to him, does only one thing-stand inthe way of just not doing his job, but LETTING him do his job. The brass sees his function as being a means to an end-just stay out there, act like you're doing your job, don't make waves and there' a nice paltry pension waiting for you aftr twenty years of service. Harry, obviously sees only the end, which is bringing criminals to justice with little regard for the ""system"". That is primarily the basic conflict inherent in ""Dirty Harry"", which I thought was strikingly profound. It was more than just the big .44 and the ""I know what you're thinkin' punk"" dialogue. This is about a man with the temerity to rebelliously fight the system that he fully realizes only serves to ""handcuff"" a detective such as he who is truly dedicated to performing his job-dutifully protecting the citizenry of San Francisco. Critics at the time of the movies release, namely Pauline Kael, denounced the film as being ""fascist"" and ""condoning police torture of suspects"". But this is a movie, and by the time Harry first shoots Scorpio on the football field and proceeeds to dig his heel into an old leg wound that was earlier the result of Harry stabbing him just as Scorpio was about to kill him first-how can someone like Pauline Kael rant about victim's rights? Scorpio also, by this time, had shot a young female swimmer to death (the film's opening scence), murdered Charlie Russell, a ten year-old black boy, and also killed Ann-Mary Deacon, a fourteen year-old girll on her way to the movies. Given all this and Harry's heartfelt concern for these victims, how the hell can anyone root against this guy?

92159,5,0790732300,"Released in 1971 to luke warm reviews, ""Dirty Harry"" is without question one of the best urban police action films ever made, and is a  classic piece of American Cinema that's as relevant today as it was  then.
Beautifully filmed on location in San Francisco by Bruce Surtees,  director Don Siegel's film captures the pulse and fears of the American  public in a time of great social upheaval. The movie addresses those fears  in a ""law enforcement shackled by Miranda"" theme, and draws the  main characters in broad uncompromising strokes.
Enter Inspector Harry  Callahan of the San Francisco Police Department. Known as ""Dirty  Harry"" within the bureau, Callahan works homicide and is regarded as a  straight ahead, no nonsense investigator with a reputation for solving  cases. Callahan is not politically correct and doesn't care for those who  engage in its' posturing, which is the subtext and ignition point for the  tension in this film.
As the movie opens, Callahan is investigating the  murder of a woman who is shot while taking a dip in a rooftop swimming  pool. The crime occurs in the downtown area, and Callahan theorizes the  murder was probably committed by a rifleman from an adjacent rooftop at  some distance. The theory pays off when Callahan checks a neighboring high  rise to find spent rifle cartridge casings. Near the casings a note is  found from a serial killer named Scorpio, who threatens to shoot others in  sniper attacks throughout the city should the Mayor's office fail to pay  the ransom demand.
This information is shared with the Mayor (played  by John Vernon) who unhesitatingly agrees to pay the ransom to avoid a  political firestorm of criticism should the demand ever become public  knowledge. This only serves to further incense Callahan, who spends the  rest of the film hunting for Scorpio as he battles internal pressure from  the department as much as the danger on the street.
Sterling  performances are handed in by Eastwood, Andrew Robinson as Scorpio, and  Reni Santoni as Chico , a young idealistic officer newly assigned as  Callahan's partner. The movie is also aided by an excellent musical score  by Lalo Schifrin. The soundtrack is at times slow and ethereal, then  accelerates, beautifully accentuating action sequences.
Reviews of this  film in the early seventies (remember Pauline Kael?) were often wordy,  unfair, and overly simplistic, concentrating on Callahan's worst  personality traits and wringing them for all the sensationalistic print  they were worth. But the film succeeds on several levels built around  Eastwood's great performance as a frustrated cop who wants to put a  murderer away.

Influencing movies like ""Freebie and The Bean"" and ""Rollercoaster"" in the '70's and ""48hrs"",""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Cobra"",""Lethal Weapon"", ""Robocop"" and ""Die Hard"" in the '80's.""Rollercoaster"",""48 hrs"" and ""Robocop"" being the most entertaining inspirations. There was an organization,N.A.T.O.,the National Association of Theater Owners,(not to be confused with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and every year for many years the voted for the top 10 box-office attractions of the year. In 1971,Clint Eastwood was No. 1 on the list. John Wayne,Paul Newman and Steve McQueen were also on the list. He held that spot several times in the 1970's and was in the top five into the late 1980's. And,near the top in the 1990's. Eastwood is one the very few actors to be a top draw for four decades,(John Wayne,Paul Newman and Sean Connery are the only others that I can think of off the top of my head).I don't know if N.A.T.O. is still around. FORBES magazine has a list of the top earning actors and actresses every year.

 The character,Harry Callahan was created by a woman named Rita Fink, along with her husband Harry Julian Fink wrote the original story. They wrote the Western ""Big Jake"" for John Wayne the same year. Wayne was offered the role first and turned it down. John Wayne would play a cop for the first time in ""McQ"" in 1974 which was a pretty good flick and for the last time in ""Brannigan"" in 1975 which was even better. Steve McQueen was offered the role next and turned it down,because he didn't want to do another cop movie. Burt Lancaster and Robert Mitchum turned it down. The original title was ""Dead Right"".Callahan originally was an older New York City detective who was about to retire. Frank Sinatra was all set to do the part,but injured his thumb,and since there was a lot of stunt work required,he had to drop out. It also had a different director then. Paul Newman turned the role down next and suggested Clint Eastwood do it. Eastwood agreed to do it but only if they let his friend and mentor,Director Don Siegel direct it. They had their frequent screenwriter Dean Riesner to polish up the script to their specifications,and they went on to make what is now considered by many a classic cop movie. The film historian for TIME magazine Richard Schickel and the well known film critic Gene Siskel included. In the film's opening,it's dedicated to those members of The San Francisco Police Department who gave their lives in the line of duty.

The now classic line,""I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five. Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself. But this being a .44 magnum,the most powerful handgun in the world and could blow your head clean off. You have to ask yourself a question, ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well do ya punk?"" was written by writer and future director John Milius. He wasn't mentioned in title credits for some reason. He went on to co-write the screenplay for ""Jeremiah Johnson"" in 1972,which Robert Redford has said was his personal favorite role and the Western ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" starring Paul Newman the same year. Milius also wrote ""Apocalypse Now"" which was nominated for the ""Oscar"" for Best Picture in 1979. He wrote and directed ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Arnold Swarzenegger in 1982 and the screenplay for ""A Clear and Present Danger"" with Harrison Ford in 1994.

Andy Robinson gave a very effective performance as ""Scorpio"". Mr. Robinson's movie debut, making it all the more impressive. The role was based on the ""Zodiac"" killer who terrorized San Francisco back in the late 1960's. Don Siegel ,who was also the producer, wanted World War II hero and actor Audie Murphy to play the role of the sniper (originally called Charles Davis),but sadly he was killed in a plane crash earlier that year. ""Scorpio"" is a psychopath,a maniac who says he will enjoy killing one person every day until the city pays his ransom demands of $100,000,(with the inflation factor that would amount to about a few million in today's dollars.) Harry Callahan is assigned the case to track him down. I've had this in my collection since back in the 1980's,first on Beta,then VHS and now on DVD.Now I can really appreciate Bruce Surtees' fine cinematography and composer Lalo Schifrin's pulsating,bass pounding,jazz-rock score which is credited as the forerunner of Jazz Fusion. The DVD has the optional commentary by Richard Schickel, and some entertaining documentaries. The picture quality and Dolby Digital sound are better than ever. Thank you Warner Bros. In an article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY magazine in 1999 they put ""Dirty Harry"" on a list of polarizing movies.""A Clockwork Orange"" was on the list along with"" E.T."",""Kramer vs. Kramer"",""Titanic"",and some others. These are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. People either loved them or hated them. For those of you who are reading this and have already seen the movie,here is a trivia question for you. There are four reasons they called him ""Dirty Harry"".What are they?The answer is at the end of this review.

 Don Siegel who passed away in 1991 of cancer at the age of 78, left a legacy of fine films among them the science fiction classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" from 1956,(there was an terrific remake in 1978 with Don Siegel  having a cameo playing a cab driver and Nicole Kidman in another remake in 2006).He made the Western ""Flaming Star"" from 1960 starring Elvis Presley,one of Elvis' few good movies,the World War II drama ""Hell is for Heroes"" from 1962 starring Steve McQueen,the crime drama ""The Killers"" from 1964,with Lee Marvin and Ronald Reagan's final movie role and the only time he ever played a bad guy,(two years before he was elected governor of California and 16 years before being elected President. And from 1968,the police drama ""Madigan"" starring Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda and the crime drama ""Coogan's Bluff"",which was the first film he made with Eastwood. They went on to make the Western ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" co-starring Shirley MacLaine and the Gothic Civil War drama ""The Beguiled"" with Geraldine Page both in the year 1970. In 1973 he produced and directed ""Charley Varrick"",an overlooked and underrated crime drama with Walter Matthau and in 1976 the Western ""The Shootist"",John Wayne's final film which was just excellent. And in 1979,""Escape from Alcatraz"" based on a true story,which would be the last time he and Eastwood would work together. May I also recommend his autobiography,""A Siegel Film"" published in 1993,(two years after his death),in which he talks about all these films and much more. The book is out of print now,however it may be available from Amazon.com. They tracked down a copy for me some years back which I really appreciated.

Clint Eastwood called this a very romantic film. Eastwood said he was attracted to the role because the character was kind of sad. Also he liked that the character became obsessed. In the film ""Unforgiven"" which won the ""Oscar"" for Best Picture of 1992 with Clint Eastwood also winning for producing and directing,after the closing credits,he dedicated the film to the late Director Sergio Leone who directed those Italian spaghetti Westerns, where Eastwood played  ""The Man With No Name"",A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good,The Bad and The Ugly"" and to Don Siegel,a fitting tribute. In an interview in PSYCHOLOGY TODAY in 1992,Eastwood seemed to feel a little guilty about making this and some of the other rather violent pictures he made back in the 1960's,'70's and 80's. He would go on to say that ""Dirty Harry"" and the other ones seem rather tame by today's standards. Gene Siskel called ""Unforgiven"" and ""A Perfect World"" from 1993 and apology from Clint Eastwood.

In an interview from 1993,Doris Day,who was a neighbor of Eastwood's in Carmel,California,(she was also No. 1 on the list of the top box-office attractions a few times back in the 1960's) was asked what her favorite Clint Eastwood movie was. She replied,""Dirty Harry""Oprah Winfrey did a show at Eastwood's home in 1997. She asked his mother Ruth,then 88 at the time,what what was her personal favorite of all her son's movies was. She replied. ""Dirty Harry"".Ms. Day and Mrs. Eastwood have excellent taste. Gene Siskel and Richard Schickel are both members of The American Film Institute. In 2003,on the AFI's list the Top 50 Movie Heroes of All-Time,""Dirty Harry"" ranked No. 17 on the list. Lalo Schifrin's score also made the AFI's list of the Top 250 Film Scores of All-Time. The AFI also picked one of the posters as one of the Top 100 Movie Posters of All-Time. The tagline for the poster read,DETECTIVE HARRY CALLAHAN, HE DOESN'T BREAK MURDER CASES, HE SMASHES THEM! Another one sold on an eBay auction for 10 thousand dollars. The tagline for that poster read, MEET DIRTY HARRY AND THE HOMICIDAL MANIAC HARRY'S THE ONE WITH THE BADGE.Eastwood has an original copy of that one in his office. The .44 Magnum is now the third most powerful handgun. The Smith&Wesson .500 Magnum is now the most powerful. In 2012,The Library of Congress chose ""Dirty Harry"" for preservation for the ages. There are only 674 films on the list. His ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" from 1976,""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection"" are also on The Library of Congress' list,a great honor indeed.

The answer to the trivia question,1)He hates everybody. 2)He's a peeping Tom. 3)He gets every dirty job that comes along. 4)He's always getting the s**** end of the stick.",954806400,2,10121,4.858053302433372

Police do their jobs but courts and parole boards let violent monsters out again.  New laws favor the criminals instead of the victims.  Laws need to be changed where thieves can be shot and you will see thief and burglaries go way down.  Take politics out of the police department and let the police do their jobs.  Police used to be able to shoot criminals who did not stop after they hollered, ""Police, stop or I will shoot!""
