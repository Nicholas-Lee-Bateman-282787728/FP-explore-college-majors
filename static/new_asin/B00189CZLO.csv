8268952,5,B00189CZLO,"To those of you who see no hope for this little girl, you don't understand that it is not how you start in life that matters. It is how you finish the race. As long as there is God, there is hope for anyone, regardless of economic status, background, or environment. There is always hope, there is always opportunity. The grandmother may not have had a lot of money to give to Autumn, but she certainly gave her love. As a little girl who grew in poverty myself, I am a college graduate with a blessed life, and a husband. This little girl has tenacity and is very smart.  I know she is going to be successful, so those of you who feed negativity into this little girl's life. Keep your negative comments to yourself.",1404604800,,717,4.311111111111111
8268953,4,B00189CZLO,"This film was sad. The grandmother was giving the 3 year old explicit and morally incorrect instruction on man-woman relationships. It was so disturbing to see that they were forcing a baby into full-blown maturity. This film gives a brief glimpse in to the dysfunction of poor black families in the US. I see the lifestyle that is lived among some black families and I have to ask myself: ""Is this what the Civil Rights Movement was all about? Where, oh where did the pride and commitment to hard work go?"" It's so sad that this little girl is very likely going to replicate the vicious cycle of all the women in her family. smh",1400371200,,629,4.478260869565218

8268955,5,B00189CZLO,This is a story not many people pay attention to nowadays. Smart and cute little girl in a poverty stricken family with not much hope to break the cycle. Would love to know how Autumn is today.,1395014400,,193,4.243243243243243
8268956,3,B00189CZLO,The film is based on a bright 3 year old girl with a possible future but could be detoured because of the level of poverty surrounding her.,1394236800,,139,4.185185185185185
8268957,4,B00189CZLO,"An eye opening look into the life of a child. Hearing this story broke my heart, as much as I want to think that Autumn has a fair chance in life and will break the cycle of poverty and poor decisions, history has a way of repeating itself.",1393804800,,240,4.020833333333333
8268958,5,B00189CZLO,"This film is a poignant view through the eyes of a child, and the cycle that poverty can bring.  A lesson on how important it is to make the right choices in life.  The film did not stress the importance of education except the reality of the struggle.
It doesn't matter what background once comes from. People can exit the struggle through education. At the young age of 39 - the grandma is worn because of her own choices in life, and sees how it has affected her children, and relies heavily on gov't assistance. Autumn's uncle chooses to sell drugs when needed 'to get by' and help the family to survive another day.  Very similar to how the gov't system enables by 'getting by'.  Clearly, the system is broken.  For a child, instability of moving from place to place can hamper the spirit and relationships later in life, but the children in that house should focus on education and seek a mentor via community programs.  There exists hope for this little girl (and maybe too for her aunts and uncle) given her mother's second chance at life's journey. I hope there is a follow up to this film.",1393804800,,1099,4.49748743718593
