8100956,5,B000CR76US,"That's right fans, Firepower in a USA compatible format! Now follow me: yes, this is a Portuguese copy BUT it's in a format that will play on American DVD players. The audio is in English, it has Portuguese subtitles available but you can turn those off. As for bonus features there is the original trailer, bios and a gallery. If your a fan of this movie I would advise you to jump on it. Good picture and audio transfer. Make sure that your buying the exact one that I did because there are a number of foreign releases that will not be compatible with North American players. Now for the movie itself. A well done action capper filmed entirely on location in the southern Caribbean. A well known castof players include James Coburn, Sofia Loren, O.J. Simpson, Anthony Franciosa and Geroge Grizard. Vencent Gardinia and Billy Barty round out the cast. Primarily an English production, firepower has lots of action and adventure and a cast that does an excellent job of bringing life to a script that has a few shades of a Howard Hughes-esque villain at its center. It's a good story with a well choses cast set against a travelogue of the Caribbean. Enjoy.",1364601600,,1158,4.62621359223301
8100957,2,B000CR76US,"This version of ""Firepower"" has very low resolution and washed out video quality, recorded from VHS?  The poor quality destroys the beautiful Caribbean scenery - one of the main attractions of the movie.  The other main attraction is Sophia Loren, and she is able to shine through the poor quality.",1345852800,3,298,4.94
8100958,5,B000CR76US,"Very good material. It covers many aspects of warfare and military vehicles from many countries and generally felt objective.
The episodes are short and you can skip any that does not seems interesting or watch them in whatever order you want.
It has some USA centered episodes but if you're looking for subjective titles that spend all the time ""explaining"" why USA military vehicles are so much greater than any other look elsewhere.",1246060800,,435,4.972602739726027
8100959,4,B000CR76US,"Firepower is a surprisingly good late 70's thriller with James Coburn and Sophia Loren.  All of the key elements are here--""faceless"" billionaire a la Howard Hughes, the saavy renegade in James Coburn, and Sophia Loren looking as striking and stylish as always--while making you wonder what side she's on. The plot--bringing the billionaire to justice--is a so so one...but the aforementioned elements as well as several exotic Caribbean locales make this a worthwhile thriller with a good ending.",982195200,13,497,5.371794871794871
