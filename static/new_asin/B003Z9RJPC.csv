It is inspiring to watchf this group of teenegers discover their love for dance and at the same time through the choreography of Pina Baush gain a new perspective about youth, love, and life.",1294876800,14,303,4.527272727272727
4233438,5,B003Z9RJPC,"It all started with Kelly Hargraves. She's the publicist for First Run Features, and a primary source of so many of the great documentaries I see for review. Kelly has a passion for dance, for film, and the melding of the two. The inclusion of dance documentaries and dance films in First Run Features' catalog is the result of her passionate influence. In turn, this philistine's introduction to the worlds of dance film is directly due to her gentle persuasion. So, dear reader, you've been warned. This review of ""Dancing Dreams"" is composed by a vulgarian confronting a fine art -- for watching dance at its creative evolutionary edge is, for me at least, like entering another world with unfamiliar languages and rituals.

""Rehearsal Director."" Now there's a new term on me. The two rehearsal directors are Josephine Ann Endicott and Bndiete Billiet. They're in a dance hall, in Wuppertal, Germany, working with a large group of adolescents from more than 11 schools, teaching them a dance. But Billiet and Endicott didn't write the dance, I mean choreograph the dance. That was done by a lady named Pina Bausch who is, like, this world-famous dancer and choreographer who died in 2009. Bausch is in this movie, evaluating, helping, and teaching the dancers, but not all the time. Endicott and Billiet do almost all the teaching work.

This three-women producing/directing team is teaching these teenagers how to do this dance -- one which has been performed around the world for decades. Some of the kids have never danced before. I'm not sure how or why the team chose non-dancers, but I readily admit it makes the whole thing kinda more interesting -- especially considering this dance, called ""Kontakthof"", is something about how people connect with each other. In addition to the raw challenge to learn this dance for public performance, the group is being directed to perform highly stylized erotic movements -- moves most teens would save for `freak' dancing in the dark confines of a club. Plus, there's more than dance. There's acting. Quick vignettes occur between the dancers who have short lines of dialog to express.

Filmmakers Anne Linsel and Rainer Hoffman cover the rehearsals, Pina Bausch's participation, and interview the kids as well as Bausch, Billiet, and Endicott at and away from their rehearsal hall. We also see some portions of the piece being performed for the public. Through it all we share in the joy, tensions, struggles, and uncertainties both the kids and the rehearsal directors face as they travel light years of change and learning preparing their dance.

The DVD's special features include a Pina Bausch biography, a photo gallery, director's notes, and First Run Feature's `Dance Gallery'.

Okay, Kelly. What's next?",1294272000,21,2761,5.046052631578948

4233443,3,B003Z9RJPC,"I don't understand in this age of internet, Dvd and blu-ray - with the desire for people to seek out and find interesting things - why everything isn't available. So a camera crew is assembled to film Pina Bausch's dance company training students to perform one of her most famous pieces. It's absorbing. The documentary is fine. You get glimpses of the students practicing and a few actual segments of the show they are putting on. The non-professional cast of students recruited to perform the show are enaging and vulnerable as they open themselves up physically and mentally to perform an intimate work like ""Contact."" We get to learn a little of their backstories and personalities. As interesting as seeing the methods and work behind putting such a show on, ultimately in the end, I wanted to see the finished product. Where is it? It would seem if the work is so exciting and famous, that perhaps the show should have been it's own DVD and interviews with students and ""making of"" segments as special features. But what you get is a documentary about the making of Contact Zone while having no access to really seeing Contact Zone! Surely the performance was filmed in it's entirety. Why isn't THAT on the DVD?  Kontakthof is never going to make an appearance in my little corner of Massachusetts and I doubt I'll schedule a trip to Germany - but isn't that the point of having all these cheap digital cameras, streaming and netflix around? It seems so obvious that the DVD buyer would want to see the full dance performance. It would be akin to making someone watch the DVD of all the ""making of"" documentaries from the Lord of the Rings trilogy and then never get to see the actual films!",1345766400,31,1698,4.66
4233444,3,B003Z9RJPC,"That DVD is a very nice insight into the unique approach of Pina Bausch. Those teenagers are touching with their sensitivity, their blockages, their boundaries... Pina pushes them all out of their comfort zones!",1344470400,,211,5.235294117647059
4233445,4,B003Z9RJPC,"""Dancing Dreams"" (""Tanztrume"") is a German documentary film about teenagers who, in order to perform a Pina Bausch piece on stage, had practiced dancing every Saturday for more than ten months under the supervision of this legendary artist. Doing a Pina Bausch piece means not just wearing costumes or memorizing lines and choreography. Performers are required to show their personalities and emotions, and what those non-professional dancers - some are confident, some shy, all young - are about to do is nothing ordinary. The result is a surprisingly uplifting experience for dancers and us viewers alike.

About one year before her untimely death, renowned dancer and choreographer Pina Bausch embarked on a very unique project: ""Kontakthof"" (literally meaning ""Place of Contact""), one of Bausch's most famous pieces, performed by forty teenagers with no previous dancing experience on stage. Back in 2000 Pina did a similar (but equally ambitious) project, ""Kontakthof"" with men and women over sixty-five years old, but this time, the dancers are all young.

This means the dancing lesson often becomes something like a high school class, with three ""teachers"" Pina Bausch and two choreographers and former dancers for Bausch's company Tanztheater Wuppertal, Josephine Ann (Jo Ann) Endicott and Bndicte Billet. It seems Pina Bausch was so busy that the teenagers are mostly choreographed by Endicott and Billet. The two choreographers (who sometimes look like the teenagers' mothers) are always patient, never raise their voices, but give the dancers precise instructions. And Pina Bausch sits behind the desk like a headmaster, quiet and understanding, knowing what is wrong with the dancing and gently tells about it.

Most of the film's time is spent on the rehearsals and the dance on the big day. Pina Bausch briefly speaks before the camera, but the film belongs to Jo Ann Endicott and Bndicte Billet, and these likeable teenagers, some of whom speak of the tragic incidents they went through. Their teacher-pupil relationship is obviously based on the mutual trust, which is probably the best asset of the film.",1332115200,3,2122,5.29080118694362
4233446,5,B003Z9RJPC,"I don't know anything about dance and went to see this because my friend wanted someone to go with him.  At first I was like ""oh great what did I get myself into for the next hour and a half"" because I didn't want to watch annoying teenagers do what seemed like horrible dance moves - especially after watching dancers with machine-like precision on So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With the Stars. But there was so much more going on. These teenagers first of all seemed so different than american teenagers. They seem more authentic and more human somehow. It was amazing to see what was asked of them in the raw, behind the scenes, way we were able to see it.  The teachers were so dedicated, such good guides, so in love with the youth of the teenagers. The teenagers themselves were transformed and the final product was actually really great.  Pina seemed to understand the symbol she embodied, she was a muse and she took the responsibility seriously, pointing past herself to something great. Not many egos can withstand that but she bore the burden of what she represented very well.  She was old and had seen it all in terms of dance yet she was as mesmerized as we were.  I felt transported during this movie and afterward, I felt so alive. You can't ask for more from a movie than that.",1315180800,43,1304,4.46218487394958
4233447,2,B003Z9RJPC,"This is a film about Kontakthof - Mit Teenagern ab 14.  It is where, over a period of 10 months, a selection of Teenagers who live in Germany are selected to be trained and perform a work under the direction of Pina Bausch and her senior colleagues.  It is certainly an anti-dote to any looking to escape today's teenage entitlement culture.  The film shows the rigors of attending to the demands made of the piece for a dance group.  There is Pina Bausch, who with a glance here and a word there, affirms the efforts of students and tips a wink to her colleagues as to how her imagination as the authority of the work is becoming fulfilled by what she sees.  This would be fine if that were all there was to it, but the film goes on and on with interviews with teenagers about their personal experiences and sense of self-esteem. That is, almost in the shadow of the great dancer.  To be honest though it smelled like just another example of a charismatic German holding the emotions of young people in her hands.  In the end I could easily imagine her pointing and hand gestures belonging to an Auschwitz doctor deciding who can work and who is for the ovens.  I just wish someone on earth would criticize this woman.",1311897600,4,1219,4.434977578475336
4233448,5,B003Z9RJPC,"From the moment I saw Darcy Bussell in the Royal Opera Ballet's performance of Sylvia I fell in love with her, and with ballet.  As my collection grew, so did my knowledge of this wonderful mixture of mime and dance.  Somewhere along the way, with ballets such as the Royal Opera Ballet's performance of Handel's Acis and Galatea, as choreographed by Wayne McGregor, and George Balanchine's Jewels/Joyaux  with the Ballet of the Opera national de Paris, I began to see Ballet as part of the all encompassing art form called Dance. My explorations in the field of Dance has led me to Pina Bausch.  Ms Bausch passed away in 2009.  She left behind a body of work I am now beginning to explore.  Dancing Dreams is a film made from portions of Ms. Bausch's larger work called Contact Zone.  In that Work Ms.  Bausch took 40 German teenagers, who had no experience with Ballet or Dance, and for ten months trained each of them to discover the magic of their own bodies, and, in so doing, made them better prepared to face the realities of the world around them.  Everyone in the film speaks German (no problem for me)  but there are English subtitles. The film is fun to watch.  The reason?  The young people are bright and bubbly.  So full of life and free of inhibitions.  Ms. Bausch's teachings encourages each of them to better understand their own inner workings, and, in  so doing, to learn how to better relate with their peers, and with the world about them.  The Bonus Materials include a Biography of Ms. Bausch.  Kauf' diesen DVD!  Es ist wirklich ausgezeichnet! King Arthur, Arthur Stanley Katz, May 18, 2011",1305590400,11,1614,4.623239436619718
