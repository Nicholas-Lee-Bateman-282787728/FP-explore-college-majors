And the real beauty of this filmed discourse is the light in Osho's eyes, the graceful movements of his hands, the profound Silence emanating from him as well as the infectious Joy.

This talk is from 1987 and is available in print as ch. 2 of the book ""Om Mani Padme Hum"", answering questions about blissfulness and Being. And answering with humour and pointing towards witnessing, meditation and relaxing into one's nature.

The words are profound although somehow coloured by the fact that he was talking to a large, rather inexperienced audience. Like Grateful Dead Osho's  'performances' was always dependent on the level of consciousness in the listeners.

The technical quality is great, and watching a master in action can certainly be a life transformative experience. In fact it has to be: it all depends on you and your readiness and openness.",1193788800,3,1030,4.868571428571428
