8573983,5,B00BUCDF2M,"The picture quality of this set is just unbelievable. I was not expecting the picture and audio quality to come out this excellent. This is the Japanese import of the series which does not come with English audio or subtitles, however, this is without question the definitive collection of this classic. This set is only for collectors and for people who have a blu ray burner as well as the english dvd release of the series, this way you can sync up the subtitles from the dvd source with the bd... I highly recommend this for Gundam fans trying to find the best collection possible.",1386374400,6,585,4.580952380952381
