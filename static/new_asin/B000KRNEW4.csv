8158818,4,B000KRNEW4,This is a great CD.  It makes it easier to follow if you already know how to dance salsa. I would recommend this CD if you want to improve on your salsa styling and footwork echniques.,1272758400,,184,4.111111111111111
8158819,2,B000KRNEW4,"I like the steps that the vid breaks down.  i tried picking some of these up from you tube - but this vid is much better.  but its also far from ideal.  you might want to rent this one from netflix before you throw down 35 bucks.

Most of this video is shot from the front.  The teacher does not mirror the steps.  SO if you want to learn this stuff you have to flip it - if she moves to the left - you move to the right etc.  it makes everything extra complicated.  only BAD TEACHERS or teachers teaching professional dancers would do this - most teachers mirror the steps if they are teaching from the front.  in video production, they can press one button, and the entire video image is flipped - so if the teacher is bad and cant mirror the steps they can fix it in a second.  if the teacher is so lame that she cant flip the steps in her mind, why is she expecting students to flip everything on the fly.

they have a little box in the side that shows the feet from another angle.  do they mirror the feet?  NO.  do they show the step from the back?  NO.  its the same front view from a slight 30 degree angle. Another wasted poorly thought out effort.

its true that at the end she shows the step from the back and the side - but she does all the break downs from the bad front angle.

also the audio sux. she sounds super muffled.  like she has her head in a carboard box.

she demos the steps to super fast music.  then afterwards recommends that you practice to really slow music.  does that make sense?

the teacher comes off not as a street salsa dancer.  or a salsa fanatic.  instead she comes off as a professional college educated dancer.  like she could break into modern jazz broadway style ballet.  which is cool.  but i would hope to learn from a salsa obsessed monomaniac that learned salsa on the streets of nyc/miami/la/havana/cali or whatever at the age of 3.",1212105600,3,1881,4.19327731092437
8158820,1,B000KRNEW4,"It is painful to watch. The instructor needs to learn herself what a Latin move is. Besides, there is so little on this DVD that you better spent your money elsewhere. You can rent it on Netflix and see for yourself.",1203033600,4,216,4.2926829268292686
8158821,5,B000KRNEW4,"This is an excellent DVD.  I highly reccomemded for anyone wanting to learn salsa dance footsteps.  The instructor is not showing of, her voice is clear and she demonstrates a true intention to teach what she knows.  I have been dancing salsa for some time but could not get the footwork.  My work and the location I live makes it impossible to find a good salsa dance school let alone a good instructor or partner.  After purchasing several videos that were not helpful I was a little concerned about this one but my desire to learn was stronger than my concern so I purchased it and I am glad I did.  I have seen the footwork demonstrated on the video at the club numerous times.  A partner is not necessary for this video even though having a partner makes learning to dance salsa that much easier.  With patience and practice anyone can get it.  The instructions are clear and she demonstrates the steps from the front and the back.  She gives helpful hints, motivation and plenty of practice.  I do recommend that the person who buys this DVD learns the basic step in order to follow her a little bit easier but if you don't that will not be a problem either since it will just take a bit longer to grasp the footwork concept and like I said before patience and practice is necessary.  Now, I wish she had another DVD with additional footwork since I already learned this one.  The DVD is not perfect though.  A mirror for a background would have been a plus and the menu could use some improvement.  Overall, I highly reccomended and I have trully enjoyed it.",1184976000,11,1565,4.461267605633803
