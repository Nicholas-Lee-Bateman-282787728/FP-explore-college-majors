6612734,5,B00N7WK2ME,"This very special tour by Charlie and Sharon Adams brought us from our living room right out into the wilds of the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone.  What wonderful photography and certainly will get folks excited about traveling and seeing these panoramic vistas one day themselves, and are especially treasured by many who may not be able to travel anymore themselves.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone and hope that more of these gorgeous tours are coming in the future!",1410912000,,475,4.925
6612735,5,B00N7WK2ME,"Having a love of photography and nature, I have to say that I really enjoy this DVD.  I spent 3 weeks vacation in Yellowstone 20 years ago.  Watching the video brought back alot of wonderful memories.  The photograhy is wonderful; the music, and the narratives all combine to make a fun, informative, and entertaining video.  I would suggest this DVD to anyone who may be traveling to this area or even to people who just want to see what the Tetons and Yellowstone are like.  I have watched the DVD three times and enjoyed it more each time!",1410825600,5,542,4.489795918367347
6612736,5,B00N7WK2ME,"My wife and I recently viewed this video by Charles and Sharon Adams and loved it. I have been to Yellowstone park and the Tetons but would not consider myself an expert on the area.  This video showed me areas of the park that I missed and others where I wished I had spent more time.  It is perfect for pre trip planning for visitors who have never been to the area and for those who are undecided what to see on their first trip to our beautiful Northwest United States.

I also ride motorcycles.  Also featured in the video are great shots of the Beartooth highway.  I have heard from many of my biker buddies that say this is probably one of the premier motorcycle rides in the United States.",1410652800,5,697,4.290076335877862
6612737,4,B00N7WK2ME,"This is a great dvd if you are planning a trip, especially a photo trip, to this area.  It shows what you can do in seven days
and what you will see in mostly HD photos with some voice and some video.  It includes a beautiful highway to Cody from
E. Yellowstone gate,  and two nationally acclaimed scenic highways the Chief Joseph to the Beartooth
byway up through the Beartooth mountain range and back down.  Be sure to rent a vehicle meant for this trip.  It is
also informational and entertaining for those who cannot travel.  I think you could photograph more animals than this if you
got out to the right places in early am and late pm.  Not for those who like a lot of video and action.",1410307200,3,692,4.276923076923077
8676488,2,B00N7WK2ME,Didn't love this and it didn't help us as we planned our Yellowstone visit,1468368000,,74,4.357142857142857
8676489,5,B00N7WK2ME,"These are the vacation snaps and videos we all wish that we were capable of producing. The accompanying narrative conveys  along with the guidebook basics any traveler needs to feel confident -- many facts that reveal themselves only in experience and can make all the difference when you're actually there.  Youll learn, for example, how long it takes to cover an area comfortably (without rushing the picture-taking) and which times of day are most favorable for certain types of photography along the routes recommended.

Put together in a format that instructs gently, without detracting from the sheer pleasure of viewing it, this presentation functions on at least three levels: as spectacular and informative entertainment that everybody can enjoy; as a practical and inspirational template for travel planning; and as an expert reference for photographers who want to get the most out of a visit.

When given the opportunity to compare photos of the same landscape in different atmospheric conditions, I was reminded of Monets Haystacks and other series paintings in which his ultimate subject became the vagaries of light, with their play on color. Wouldnt we be lucky if hed been able to record just how he captured each effect?

To speak of artistry, I should mention having seen this in both DVD and Blu-Ray.  As a Blu-Ray newbie, I wasn't sure that it would really make any difference in the visual quality.  It does.",1454544000,2,1430,5.059574468085106

8676491,5,B00N7WK2ME,"I wanted to see if a trip to the park would be something for my family. After viewing this video and the great pictures and the ""hidden"" sights, I know we will be going. Beautiful!",1419552000,,180,4.171428571428572
8676492,5,B00N7WK2ME,I love to take pictures and enjoy seeing what others do with their photos.  Sharon has done an excellent job of capturing the essence of the Northwest.  I have never been to Yellowstone but watching this video made me want to go.,1417392000,,229,4.428571428571429

8676496,5,B00N7WK2ME,"Watching this colorful and interesting DVD allows you to experience Yellowstone before you even get there in person.  It was informative and an excellent example of all that the the area has to offer.  Having been to Yellowstone once before, this DVD showed me areas and wildlife I had not seen on my visit and brought me back to the areas I had.  This DVD is sure to please and keep your interest the entire time!",1413072000,2,414,4.421052631578948
8676497,5,B00N7WK2ME,"This is an excellent video.  Between the narrative and photographs, it makes you feel as if you are there touring the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone.  The personal touch can be seen in this video.  Although I have seen various specials about this subject before, this video gives you a better sense of actually being there, almost as if you are there experiencing it for yourself.  After seeing some of the pictures, I could close my eyes and feel the environment all around, from the sights and sounds to the smell and feel of the area.

This is a video that I would recommend not just to family and friends but to all.",1410912000,4,618,4.482142857142857
