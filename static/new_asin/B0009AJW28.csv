8058953,5,B0009AJW28,"The Time-Life ""Battlefield"" series is one of the GREAT ones, in video. It often includes both Preludes and Battles, themselves, in the Stalingrad, Battle of France, Battle of Midway, Battle of Italy and other parts of the series. It delineates the leaders, the equipment, the tactics, etc. in significant detail, and is very-valuable, as it gives further insight into our hindsight, about the great battles of the 20th century.",1426291200,,427,5.202898550724638
