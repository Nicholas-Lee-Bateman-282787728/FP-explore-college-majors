4129988,5,B003JLL2RW,I love this movie!  Kellie Martin and her Jewish foster family are terrific.  The love that they show for each other is awesome.  But please get this on DVD!  The VHS copy I have makes buzzing sounds.,1170201600,6,200,4.324324324324325
4129989,4,B003JLL2RW,"as one reviewer said. It is a good history film that should be shown to many generations. Kellie Marin does a fine job of portraying the teenage girl who must raise her little sister on her own,plus take in 13 Jews which she manages to hide in her attic. The acting and writing are superb. I have one complaint though, I hated the lighting in the film...it was so dark and it made the quality look cheap, like a low budget film. Other that that, it is good and I appreciated the producers not allowing a ton of violence to be shown. It is not necessary; Hearing about the war was ugly enough. Since Schindlers' List isn't exactly appropraite for young children, this one makes a nice alternative. (They won't have nightmares for months later.)
P.S. Hey Kellie Martin fans, I heard on a Down Syndrom's website that LGO is going to be released this summer on dvd! I cannot wait to purchase it! If you have never seen it, I hope you will check it out this summer, you will not regret it. It changed my life.",1133654400,46,1004,4.345744680851064

4130014,5,B003JLL2RW,"This was a heartwarming movie which I knew would end u with everyone being shot by the Nazi's.
The acting was not academy award nominee quality.
The actors were too well fed to adequately portray the reality of their situation but a little knowledge of the history of the Jews in Poland and a little imagination is needed.  To see the real conditions look at some of the actual footage of Jews being rescued by allied soldiers and the piles of corpses that didn't make it.
Be thankful that people who were not anti-Semitic lived during the occupation by the Nazi's helped a few Jews survive the Holocaust.
I recommend all with a conscience and are not Nazi lovers watch this movie and cut the actors a little slack.",1488672000,5,715,4.542635658914729

However, the big picture is this.... she demonstrated amazing bravery of a non-Jew willing to risk her and her sister's lives to save Jews during Hitler's Holocaust. These true stories should continue be told because genocide did not end with Hitler's defeat.  Brutal governments today allow/permit/encourage genocide.  I ask myself as a believer in Jesus Christ, what choice would I make?  In addition, would I be willing to stand up for my faith if my life were on the line?  It's a difficult question to answer because I personally haven't dealt with any type of physical persecution in the United States.

I would like to know what happened to their parents Jewish I'm sure since their has not been no further mention that the camps took them as they were most likely gobbled up bye the Nazis war machine of the SS. Sadly so many other didn't have a chance or have the insight to try and get out. The say never again but I ask children about such things to day and they no nothing of this past and its hard for me to imagine anyone not knowing what happened. If we can't remember the mistakes of the past we are destine to repeat it. And then to hear of people that are so ignorant who claim it never happened. I've seen the scars of war the number on the arm. And the way or GOV leaders are now so pro Muslim brotherhood, Gay marriage in this country and or fearless leader who takes a stand against Israel and the Clintons who Hillary her own self has a gay relationship with a Gov official How all so hates Israel. I see hard times coming if this country can't stand up for what our founding fathers stood for is not what are kids are being taught. So much corruption in GOV now we the people have little chance to keep our God given rights unless we stand together and fight back.

It is most sobering to see what people had to go through to survive. One of the first things Hitler did was take away people's right to own a fire arm which made them much easier to capture. The antisemitism that cause the Holocaust is rearing it's ugly head once again.

This girl helps Jews in her own home and is just so brave.  She has many challenges sent her way.  At one time the Gestapo want to taker her flat because they believe she has too much space.  She has an hour to leave.  Some inner strength and I guess message from the Gods tells her to sit tight.  The Gestapo decide they want somewhere else but the nurses can have her house.  She can share the space.  So more unwanted guests but not quite as scary as Gestapo.  Somehow she saves the lives of the people in her secret.  She is incredibly humble about her actions at the end of the war and says she didn't do anything special.

They helped several Jewish people escape the ghetto while hiding and feeding them for 2 years right under the Nazi nose.  The story doesn't focus on their faith in God, but if you look, it's there..

4130352,5,B003JLL2RW,"Magnificent, true story of a young teenage Catholic girl in Poland (Fusia) who risked her life and that of her young sister -- after her parents were sent to a German labor camp -- by single-handedly hiding thirteen (13) Jews in the attic directly above her first floor living quarters.

There were several close calls with German SS agents and nurses in close proximity for prolonged periods of time; yet she never abandoned her charges -- even at the very moment when it seemed beyond doubt they would all be discovered and executed by the Germans.

She worked to secure enough food to keep them all alive during a long two-and-a-half years in hiding until they were liberated unexpectedly by the Russians.

It will definitely make you cry and is quite an inspiration.

While somewhat lacking in realism in portraying such a harrowing situation which would have been fraught with much more suffering and angst than was depicted in the movie, the fact that it is a true story more than makes up for it.",1463875200,2,1003,4.714285714285714

As film making goes, it felt a bit breathless and superficial.  You definitely saw the events of the story, but it seemed like the film missed exposition.  The Jewish characters felt more fleshed out than the two sisters; Kellie Martin for most of the movie has no self-doubt or inner life, she just rushes from one insanely dangerous thing to another, and somehow she always gets away with it.

4130458,5,B003JLL2RW,"This is an incredible true story and as I was watching I couldn't help but be in awe that this young woman really did these things to help others. I'm surprised that this story is not more well known, especially now in 2015. This movie was made for tv, so it tones down the true violence (you hear shots but don't actually see the people get shot) and sexual situations, making it an excellent introduction to movies about the holocaust for those who don't want to watch a particularly violent movie but also want historical accuracy. While I say it say it tones these things down, it doesn't mean that any emotion is lost. It portrays things very well and I watched the whole movie just waiting for the moment when they are freed. (Just one more note, there is a couple scenes of death and blood, so I don't want to misinterpret that children should watch this movie. It's just not as graphic as, for example, Schindler's List.)",1437782400,17,929,4.502958579881657

This film focuses on a young Polish girl of faith who has a conscience, compassion and faith (Catholic) and manages to save a group of Jews by finding a place and hiding them in her attic for 2 1/2 years.  I liked the casting of this movie.  I thought the scenery was realistic for the place and period.  It showed enough of the Nazi brutality without making it or battle scenes a big part of the film.  Its a non-Hollywood film which made me enjoy it even more.

I think all adults should watch a story like this, and teens, as well (but not minor children, as there are a few traumatic scenes).  Depicted against the backdrop of WW II atrocities, the nobleness of a few individuals who risked all to help their fellow man is truly inspiring.  The movie has a happy ending but, of course, not all of its major characters survive.  This movie really keeps your heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing throughout the whole story, so maybe don't watch it right before bed time.

4130557,3,B003JLL2RW,"The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it worth showing to my 8th grade students as we make our way through literature with the WWII years as a backdrop.  The sacrifice made by this teenager to save others is a way to get kids to think of something other than themselves, which is always a good thing.  Plus, they like the movie and there isn't anything in it that is vulgar.  That being said, Kellie Martin could have used more coaching when it comes to acting as well as speaking with a Polish accent.  Listening to her and watching her is almost unbearable to me.  I'm glad my students can walk away with a good message from the movie or I wouldn't be watching it again.",1425513600,,690,4.236641221374046

I know it is easier when you trust life more at this age but wow talk about going the extra mile.  I had tears at the end, knowing it could possibly be happy was unexpected.

4130600,5,B003JLL2RW,"Fabulous movie about a real teen hero who showed remarkable strength and courage during WWII. This is a particularly good movie for teens and their families to watch together to learn about the holocaust and two girls who risked their own lives to save the lives of 13 Jews. Although there is violence in this movie, the violence is not graphic nor is it gratuitous. In fact, most of the violence happens off-screen or is shown without blood (for example, a teen boy falling to the ground after being shot). This is an excellent portrayal of true events during WWII and a great family movie for discussion. I would suggest it for 13 and up, although it may also be appropriate for some mature preteens.",1420070400,,702,4.624

4130682,3,B003JLL2RW,"I found it gripping, well acted--by Kelli Martin, Marion Ross, the rest of the cast--and expertly directed.  Amidst the horror, humanity showed itself in sensitive ways in many of the film's soft moments.  My problem with it was, whatever the nightmare situation was in real life, I found everything depicted in this film a trifle too easy.  She would walk by a guard, he would eye her and never bother to stop her and question her about her frequent trips to and fro.  A woman across the street watched the sheltered people emerge  through an opening in the building; I thought to myself, ""Uh, oh.  This film is over.  Their cover is blown to a possible collaborator.""  One of the main nazi characteristics was paranoia and suspiciousness.  After all, with all their power and because of it, they knew they were surrounded by enemies.  Still we know that what she did and so many others like her did in Europe had to have been almost insanely altruistic and brave.

In many ways, it surpasses Schindler's List as it portrays many aspects of everyday life during that time.

 It gives you a lot to think about inside yourself, because there is coming a time when in this world When People will have to make a choice FOLLOW GOD'S WORD AND TRUTHS, or follow satan's lie, and evilness!!!! So those who choose GOD and HIS HOLY TRUTHS Will now be the enemy of satan and his followers!!!! Would I STAND STRONG FOR JESUS and THOSE WHO CHOSE HIM AS WELL!!!!  and HIDE THESE FAITHFUL ONES? I was very sad, heartbreaking all through out the movie[it made me cry ] for those real people who endured this whole ordeal ! even though this was so very many many years ago, but to know and now see how people [real human beings ] are treated by other human beings!!!! and it will happen again soon!!!!  BUT WAIT IT ENDS IN JOY BECAUSE THE  THE WAR WAS OVER!!!!!  THIS MOVIE WILL BRING TEARS, MANY TEARS TO YOUR EYES!

4130766,5,B003JLL2RW,I watched this movie with two of my grandchildren ages 19 and 14. They both thought it was a good movie also. Knowing that it is based on a true story makes us realize how much they had to go through and what we take for granted every day.,1395273600,,239,3.8979591836734695
4130767,5,B003JLL2RW,I enjoyed this movie.  It was interesting because it really happened and still hard to believe people were so cruel.,1395187200,,116,4.8

4130769,5,B003JLL2RW,"I enjoyed this movie very much. One person took on the responsibility for so many others that were in danger, no matter her consequences were.

The film, of course, did not get into all of the horrors of that time but it demonstrated enough of the dangers for the people in the camps and the rescuerers that even the young adolescent who may watch the film will understand that this type of thing should never happen to another group of people.  If I was still teaching, I would request permission to show this film to my World History, American History and Government classes.

4130777,5,B003JLL2RW,"I watched this years ago, and was very impressed with its realism and heart.  Kellie Martin has always been one of my favorite actresses, and she is outstanding in this role.  It succeeds on so many levels: recreating the horrific world of Naziism; the bravery and commitment of ordinary people, regardless of religion, age, or sex, to do what's right; the unselfish sacrifice often required to make that happen.  Movies that portray important moral issues in an honest way are rare.  This one does.",1393113600,,499,4.904761904761905

4130787,5,B003JLL2RW,I thought this movie was very good.  It makes you wonder how anyone could hate other people so much to treat them the ways the Jews were treated.  Kellie Martin is superb in the movie~so expressive with her eyes.  I knew how the movie ended but it was still full of suspense.,1391299200,,275,4.25
4130788,3,B003JLL2RW,It wasn't the best holocaust movie i've seen and the acting could have been better but it certainly wasn't as bad as a few reviews i read. As far as the people in the ghetto not being horrible looking enough that wasn't what the story was about. This was a true story of a very courageous young girl who saved Jews knowing the risk to herself. I did enjoy it and would recommend it as a family movie.,1391040000,2,400,4.141025641025641

recommend this movie.  It was not a big budget movie, so that shows, but it is still a great movie.",1390780800,2,368,4.0

A smart look of WWII, the Nazis and Poland ... how civilians survived during that time and the bravery of the Jews and the non-Jewish folks who kept them safe from Nazi tyranny.

4130797,3,B003JLL2RW,"Only Hollywood could portray these images of an idyllic setting that was beyond a nightmare! A storyline based on actuality? Perhaps intended for those who have no knowledge of the reality for those who offered sanctuary to the Jews. Then again absolute reality isn't for everyone. Recommended for those who prefer fiction to the stark reality that existed during this timeline.  I am far too analytical to offer a 'sugarcoated' review. Definitely intended for viewers who are not grounded in the history of WWII and for those who prefer a Hollywood version of reality.

At first, the acting seemed forced, and I had a bit of a problem with Kellie Martin playing a Pole, but the story unfolded with enough empathy that I soon lost myself in that, rather than any type-casting expectations.

My mother-in-law, now deceased, was a survivor of a Nazi concentration camp, and though she did not speak of the atrocity often, she shared enough to instill in all of us, the lesson that there is a great evil in our world, which today, still (sadly) exists.

Although it was made for television, and in this case that is pretty obvious, it was a good addition to our study. The students liked it a great deal and were especially impressed at the end when the movie tells what happened to each of the characters ""in real life"" after the war ended.",1372204800,,434,4.506329113924051

4130862,4,B003JLL2RW,I am sure that this is only a piece of what really happened in WWII.  It is a mild in violence that a younger person in their teens could watch it as long as an adult was there to answer questions.,1369526400,,197,3.8048780487804876

This young lady was beyond remarkable in saving the lives of the group of people in her attic.
Although the theme was sad, the story pulled you into the humanity of the people and especially the protagonist who had to hide, feed and keep up the moral of those she was protecting.
A remarkable achievement.",1368316800,2,380,4.442857142857143

But if you are considering buying, I'd say buy the 10-pack movie which believe it or not, is $4.99.  I put this on Facebook as a recommendation, and a friend told me she bought it here in a 10-pack.  (Didn't even know they came that way). I haven't watched all the movies on the 10 pack, but she said she like about 7 of them a lot, so, even if you didn't care, it's cheaper to buy the other way, and I gave away the single movie to a friend.

Here is the link on Amazon for the ten pack.

4130874,2,B003JLL2RW,"This is supposedly a true story but the photography is so idyllic as to cause one to wonder where the brains of the producers were. Even the ghetto residents are clean and well dressed. One of the challenges of making holocaust fiction is to get the victims to look horrible enough. Even Schindler's List didn't do this well, but the slave laborers in that film didn't look as though a summer holiday was next on their agenda. BTW, it's always summer and the sun always shines in this ""true story."" That the story is based on fact is not what I am disputing--it is the depiction of how the Nazi's ran ghettos and camps.",1366156800,2,619,4.43859649122807

4130877,3,B003JLL2RW,"The fact that it is a true story is heart wrenching.  It is not a gripping movie.  Every once in a while they throw in a scene to grip you like a dog left alone in the street, a baby being snatched from its mother, a little boy clutching a teddy bear but all that does  not  create a feeling of reality like in The Pianist. The acting is ok, I may watch it till the end.",1364688000,,370,3.7662337662337664

4130879,1,B003JLL2RW,"This was so unrealistic!  While I think the acting was great (Kellie Martin and Marion Ross both great actresses!), the story line seemed somewhat unbelievable.  The brutality of the nazi's is well documented, and anyone being able to walk right up to the ghetto and ask to speak to a Jewish prisoner or going to them in a field where they were working under nazi guard just didn't seem real.  I believe it was based on a true story, but I guess I would fault the writers here.",1364515200,7,477,4.3977272727272725
4130880,4,B003JLL2RW,"This movie is a good portrayal of Stephania and the courage she showed in a difficult time.

After seeing Cinderella Man,The Note Book and The Green Mile,Hidden in Silence was the first Nazi Germany movie I've ever seen. Well,unless you want to include PBS's Memory of the Camps. But we don't really want to go there.....I think Kelly Martin's portrayal of that young woman's courage and hope was exponential. Let's ponder this...If that situation were to happen in TODAY'S REPRESSED SOCIETY,I wonder if there are some of us brave enough to help our fellow human being. This movie had it all. For me anyway.

4130897,5,B003JLL2RW,I showed this to my class (8th grade).  It is a good way to show that even in the bad times one can find people with good hearts and willing to help.  No every one during the Holocaust agreed with the treament of Jewish people.,1362268800,,227,4.022222222222222

Even though the movie had to pack 3 or 4 years into 2 hours (It skips months at a time, but blends well.), I enjoyed it.  In the beginning of the movie, Fusia (Kelly Martin) is a teenager staying with a Jewish family, who are friends to her family.  When the Germans come and take them away, she is left alone to fend for herself.  This movie takes you through how she copes, and also helps Jews, throughout the war.

I like this movie because it told the facts, yet I would be able to show it to a younger person.  We need to have movies that tell history but are okay for little ones to see.

4130906,4,B003JLL2RW,"This was the heroic story of a polish teenager who helps her surrogate Jewish family hide during Nazi occupation of her city. I was touched by her bravery and heroism. I thought the acting was well done, and the film would be suitable for children without being too graphic.

The only downside is the film did not seem to have subtitles which was a problem for the seniors in my home, since at times the accents were tough for them to hear and understand and so I had to tell them what was said. I would've loved if my edition had subtitles so I didn't have to do this.

Even so, I thought the story was heart-warming and worth watching.",1360713600,3,637,4.3

The Directors should have done their home work on the German regalia. Uniforms and emblems where worng. At about 1 hour 20 minutes into the film it shows a date Agust 21st 1944 and the apparent Russian attck which drives the Germans out. In reality this happened in July 1944 when the Red Army re-took Przemyael.

The way the dignity of the Jewish matriarch (portrayed by Marion Ross)was shown leaving her home and being forced to the ghetto and then as she was leaving for the death camps, was heart wrenching. I believe schools today should show these type of factual stories of the war in the classroom--not to promote hatred, but to show awareness of what can happen thru mis-conception and brain-washing.

4130976,5,B003JLL2RW,"The setting of this 90-minute VHS (now also on DVD) is Przemysl, eastern Poland, during WWII. First come the Russians, then the Germans, and finally the Russians again. Based on a true story, a teenaged Polish girl rescues many Jews by hiding them in a large house.

It is obvious that professionals did not make this film, and that it was not made by Hollywood. Granted that some of the visual effects are primitive, and that there are misconceptions about the war and occupation. What it lacks in Hollywood pyrotechnics, and other shortcomings, it more than makes up in content. It is a moving story of death-defying heroism, as well as the power of faith and prayer.

Poland in conquered in 1939, and Russians rule Przemysl. Nazi Germany attacks its erstwhile Soviet ally, and rules over Przemysl from mid-1941 to mid-1944. The teenage Polish girl ""Fusia"" (not the real name of the actual Polish girl who engaged in these heroics) loses her parents, who are deported to Nazi Germany for forced labor. She must care for herself and her little sister. Soon she will be caring for far more.

The Germans humiliate the Jews, destroy their shops, and shoot some of them. Soon they will do far more. They lock up the Jews in a ghetto. Fusia defies the law by smuggling food into the ghetto. Then the Germans start shipping the Jews out to ""labor camps"". Some of the Jews figure exactly what the Germans actually have in mind, and beg to stay with Fusia. One of them shows up, all bloody, and tells of how he had jumped out of the train. She accepts more and more fugitive Jews in her house.

The situation in which the young Fusia has to deal with is onerous. She gets a job, whose boss is a Volksdeutsche, in order to earn enough money to feed the fugitive Jews. She cannot allow a guy interested in her to walk her home, or have any semblance of a normal life otherwise. Neighbors notice more and more people going to her home. Someone comments that the food that her little sister is carrying home is ""quite a lot for two sisters."" However, no one denounces her.

During the German occupation of Poland, some Jews actually gave up, left their hiding places, and turned themselves over to the Germans--causing not only their deaths but also the deaths of other hidden Jews and their Polish benefactors. Fusia has to deal with a hysterical woman who ran out of the hiding place, and wanted to do the same.

For quite a while, things seem to be working out. There are the usual frictions between confined people, and Fusia is outraged by the conduct of some of the Jews--conduct which can easily lead to the German discovery of the hiding place, and certain death to Fusia, her sister, and all the Jews. Then, very unexpectedly, the Germans want to requisition the big house for themselves, and want it almost immediately. Fusia prays, and then...",1318896000,4,2844,4.6106719367588935

There were thousands of Fusias in Poland though that did help Jews, but they along with theier families and ENTIRE villages and towns were instantly executed by the Germans. Fortunatel Fusia and the many Jews she saved survived.

This is a must for every school or library! Finally something that is very objective and realistic. Get a big box of something to dry your tears. The ending, Oh M God, the ending is, well....

Catholics have had some bad press in recent years as more of their darker actions towards the Jews during WW2 have come to light, some of it deservedly so, but this movie transcends that and declares to all that the best of what humanity can do, can and does manifest itself, even in the midst of the baser of human depravity. I enjoyed this movie, I have an avid interest in most things relating to military history, especially WW1 & WW2, and this movie comes from a more 'quirckier' aspect of WW2. The acting is good (though not excellent) and more over tells the viewer a story than one that draws the viewer into it. If the viewer is interested in history, military history, human interaction in the most direst of circumstances and of heroism, heroism not of the sporting variety, but true heroism where someone is willing to sacrifice their lives for others who do not share in their philosophy, then this movie is for you. It is one of hope eternal, of crushing fear and of heroism of the highest order in the midst of and along with the shameable actions of a depraved society. The movie is somewhat dated now but setting that aside it is a movie most enjoyable to watch and a topic which will be discussed for days thereafter. Very thought provoking and such that I am glad that I did not live in those times as portrayed in the movie. I'd give it a 6.5 - 7.5 out of 10.",1299196800,7,1477,4.374545454545455

4131000,1,B003JLL2RW,"This is the worst holocaust movie I have seen.  There is no character development at all.  Many scenes do not make sense for anyone familiar with WWII history.  A perfect example is when, at the very beginning just before the break of the German-Soviet war, the two girls stop by a fashion store and admire a dress displayed at the window.  Does anyone truly think that stores like this existed in Union of Socialist Republic, controlled by NKVD, where millions of peasants have just died of hunger as a result of Stalin's Collectivization?

Other scenes are equally as inaccurate and/or unconvincing.  The film gives an impression of being a girls scout outing more than a WWII movie.  Fusia behaves in front of Germans like she was untouchable, perhaps because she is not Jewish.  A perfect example for it is the scene when she challenges a Ghetto guard and threatens to report him to the authorities.  Does anyone really think that a ghetto guard, perhaps a Ukrainian supporter of the 3rd Reich, would even hesitate for a second before killing the person who challenges him?

The film does shows the Germans and/or their supporters executing Jews.  However, the scenes appear almost infantile.  Screams that accompany the killings in some scenes are equally unrealistic.  As any holocaust survivor can attest, witnesses remained silent when others were killed.  After all, any screaming person was likely to be the next victim of the Ukrainian or Polish police...

The conspiracy scenes are equally as unconvincing.  Again, does anyone believe that all it took to hide from the Germans was to run fast?  Conspiracy takes hard work, the Germans were brutally efficient and had numerous supporters among the local population...

The characters are strangely emotional in many scenes.  Fusia and the Jewish survivors cry many times in this movie.  In reality, shortly after the beginning of the war, most surviving Jews have used up all their tears.  They did not have the emotional or physical strength for the emotional reunions shown a number of times in the movie.  In fact, the survivors have often described themselves as living robots.  To a large extend, the same applies to most Poles, as well.

A particular scene that put me off is the one showing Fusia bribing a Guard at the entrance to the camp with a donut.  Does anyone believe that a Nazi guard of a death camp, where people were  executed daily, could be bribed with a donut?

I short, this movie fails to convey the terror experienced by Jews and gentiles during the German occupation.  Although based on a true story, it gives a completely false impression on what the atmosphere was like in the territories occupied by the Nazis during WWII.  It does not portray at all the many collaborators, who assisted the Germans in finding the few brave Poles trying to help the Jews, usually for monetary awards.  It does not portray faithfully the slave labor in factories which operated in conquered lands.

If you still have a VCR I highly recommend buying the VHS because, unfortunately, it isn't (to the best of my knowledge) aired on TV any longer.  Hopefully, it will someday be released on DVD.",1266019200,4,311,4.15

8398227,5,B003JLL2RW,"The main character, a teen aged girl, shows unusual courage in this movie. She risked everything to intervene in the lives of thirteen people, most of all were strangers. What it took for her to keep them alive is beyond comprehension. Hidden in Silence moves along at a good pace. Far from boring, it kept me on the edge of my seat. My heart was gripped with the whole spectrum of emotions, as only an excellent movies can produce. I was especially riveted during the last fifteen minutes of this movie and was very surprised by the conclusion.",1528761600,,545,4.571428571428571

8398230,5,B003JLL2RW,"I was able to show this to my 5th grade class. I only had to skip one short scene. I thought this movie did a wonderful job balancing the brutal truths of this time period without becoming too gruesome to share as a family (or class).  Wonderfully done! And a wonderful job showing the friendship between the main character (Catholic) and the Jewish people she was protecting.

My students said it was very sad to watch, but I think the ending was uplifting enough to balance things out for them.",1522195200,,507,4.571428571428571

8398236,3,B003JLL2RW,It could have been an excellent movie. What was irritating is how the people she was helping took advantage of her and put her and her sister at greater risk.
