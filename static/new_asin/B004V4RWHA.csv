8442956,5,B004V4RWHA,"This video truly illustrates the hard work and dedication we have seen when visiting Bud & Carrie at the DeYoung Family Zoo. They have educated, as well as entertained our family for many years, and we cherish their friendship. They have created a wonderful family environment at the zoo, and talking with them is like talking to friends. This is a great DVD for anyone that loves animals and wants to see the real ""nuts & bolts"" side of running a zoo day to day. We hope to enjoy our ""zoo-cations"" for many years to come. Bless you both.",1424044800,,538,4.444444444444445

8442959,5,B004V4RWHA,It is a tender storie of two people that Have given up a life of their own to care and love animals. Having been there many times I can attest that everything is true and nothing has been sugar coated. Bud and Carrie are truly put here to protect the animals.,1390089600,,259,4.098039215686274
8442960,5,B004V4RWHA,"BEST ZOO EVER!  We have been there every Fourth of July since 2009!  Bud and Carrie are absolutely amazing with the people and the animals.  You get to be hands on with some of the animals.  It is a great experience and everyone should travel there at least once.  You WILL NOT regret it!  Hope that NGW goes back, we loved the shows and I just ordered my DVD so we can be reminded of our great experiences there!",1386201600,,413,4.1645569620253164

8442962,5,B004V4RWHA,"We've visited this zoo multiple times. Bud and Carrie are the best zookeepers around. They love people and most of all they love their animals. There is no other place that you can stand within 5 feet of a male lion and feel his roar. Yes I said feel. It's amazing to feel the ground vibrate from this awesome animal. Nowhere else can you hold, interact with, feed, and learn so much about animals. The DeYoung's are very special to our family and their zoo will be on our to do list annually. My Life as a Zoo depicts everything that these wonderful people go through on a daily basis.  Whether it's feeding a hippo, experiencing the big cats, or simply listing to Bud and Carrie's stories, this zoo is by far, the best zoo to visit.",1384905600,2,734,4.357664233576642
