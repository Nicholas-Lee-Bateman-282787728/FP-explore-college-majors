4858918,4,B005QJDFIE,"With dialogue like that, and players like Lancaster, Kirk Douglas and Lisabeth Scott, you don't have to guess which genre you've stumbled onto.  Director Byron Haskin's ('Too Late for Tears,' 'War of the Worlds') 'I Walk Alone'-- a Hal Wallis production filmed at Paramount-- may not be quite top-tier noir (as the otherwise hardboiled story gets a little soft in the middle), but it's got curves in all the right places.  Not yet released on DVD.  In the meantime, for those of us who've tossed out our VCRs, it is available to stream via Amazon and Netflix.  3 1/2 stars.",1345939200,12,573,4.7

4858936,3,B005QJDFIE,"This is a mildly successful film noir.  The acting dynamics between Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas is fun to watch.  Both actors are heads and shoulders above the other actors in the film and it is easy to see why they became super stars in their careers in Hollywood, In my view, Lisabeth Scott is fairly awful in her role.  She tries to play the tough girl who has been around but she too often comes off as a simpering cry baby.  Lauren Bacall would have been much more convincing in the role.  The best part of the movie is the scene where the Burt Lancaster's character learns that business in the underworld has changed a lot since he went to prison 14 years earlier.  Nightclubs (aka the old speakeasies) are now owned by multicorporations and most of the profits are only on paper and ownership is hard to determine.  It is not so easy to make a 50-50 split of a corporate enterprise.  The set is fascinating and gives you a great feel for the night club scene in the 1940's.  It is hard to find clubs today with that kind of class.  The movie is worth seeing just for the dynamics between Burt and Kirk.",1432944000,3,1113,4.333333333333333

4858949,4,B005QJDFIE,"Very Good little fringe noir !.....3.75 Stars.  Not a top level ""NOIR"" but reasonably entertaining if you've seen the best already.  Constantly on the hunt for any and every good to great NOIR and especially something with Lizabeth Scott in it this fit the bill.  Here one can see Burt Lancaster in his earlier acting career. He's still a little green but one can see more than a hint of the talent he would later fully develop into greatness.  All the actors could have benefited from better direction and editing but it still is a very entertaining flick.---- I hate spoilers so I'll just layout the basic framework ......Burt gets released from prision after doing a 14 year stretch and seeks to pick up where he left off in life.---- He immediately goes to meet up with his former and supposed to be STILL current bootlegging partner(Kirk Douglas).--- The fur starts flying right away. --- Lizabeth Scott plays a Night club singer who is romanticly attached to Kirk and sings at his club.  Here Liz plays another vulnerable character with scruples,  honesty and a heart like in ""The Strange Love Of Martha Ivers"".---  Wendel Cory plays the nice but weak willed accountant who doesn't know how to get out of the dirty business he's in. ---Things have changed a lot in 14 years.  As such : Has the world passed Burt by ?  Kirks Character seems to think so and there things really heat up.--- Burt unleashes a ferocious intensity as he does in many of his films but the story sometimes lacks a tight feel. ----That said If you like the actors involved and have seen their better work already you'll probably enjoy finding this more obscure and good flick.------I did.---- I am leaving this review here as its only available on instant video. The picture quality on AMZ instant video download is fairly clear with some though not a ton of film damage.  If this was available on DVD with a respectable print I would definitely buy it. ---Please enter this movie in your wish list on high priority if you liked it so that we may see a good quality DVD available for purchase in the future.---- Thanks --------------------------------------------------

4858960,5,B005QJDFIE,"If you are looking for a movie with tension, superb acting, and a decent story line then this movie fits the bill. Burt Lancaster is typically in a role where he is a jovial, lighthearted, and easy going. In ""I Walk Alone"", he plays an ex-con that is angry and embittered after 14 years in prison. His former best friend and now nemesis is played convincingly by Kurt Douglas. He is a smooth, wealthy night club owner that is as dishonest in his business dealings as in his personal life. The movie was made in the late 1940s and the speech and mannerisms of that era are interesting as the story unfolds.
The movie is well worth watching with the acting far superior to what passes for contemporary dramas.",1404604800,,707,4.488372093023256
4858961,4,B005QJDFIE,"Burt Lancaster was before my time, but I am convinced that he is one of our best actors.  One who has earned a permanent place in the hall of fame. I have dedicatedly tracked down every movie that he was ever in. There is some evidence that he became a better actor with each movie he starred in. I Walk Alone was relatively early in Lancaster's career, but he nevertheless brings the intensity and passion characteristic of his roles. Physically, he was in his prime, with his boyish good looks on full display.

The plot is simple enough. Without ruining it for anyone who may not have seen it, Lancaster's character goes to establish that there is indeed honor among thieves by taking the fall for a joint escapade. His partner, however, is not quite as honorable and his disloyalty sets the stage for the tension between the characters. Lancaster's character is blunt and unsophisticated but comes replete with a disarming honesty and earnestness that charms his audience. And even his nemesis' girlfriend. Add an all star cast, and a noire potrayal, and this movie is an instant classic.",1404432000,2,1092,4.772486772486772

4858964,4,B005QJDFIE,"I would probably watch anything with Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas and Elizabeth Scott, and with them all in the same film, I'm there. It is based on a play and it never really becomes a 'movie' but it is OK. Scott is as good as she will ever be but Lancaster and Douglas aren't quite there yet - a key pivotal scene with Lancaster's character coming to terms with how much has changed since he went to prison doesn't quite work, nor does Douglas convey that silky evilness he can do so well. Too, it is nice to see Wendell Corey. The cinematography is at times exceptional, showing what black and white film can do that color can not. I watched it free with Prime (and there are a number of other good old films like this one that Prime membership entitles you to), so yes, I would recommend both this film and Prime membership.",1399248000,6,828,4.348387096774194

From Lancaster's success in ""THE KILLERS""(1946) and Douglas's debut in ""MARTHA IVERS""(1946), these two guys could start their own gangster organization!

Also starring ""Lizabeth Scott"" and Wendell Corry, the atmosphere and action is truly dark and dangerous. This was Scott's and Corry's second film as well.

4858994,4,B005QJDFIE,"I have spent waaaaay too much of my fifty-plus years taking in movies; from tracking down `must-see' classics, to stumbling upon my own obscure favorites (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Montana/dp/B0054R6ZEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Montana</a>; 1998).  So am not sure how I missed this little gem.

Just released after taking a 14-year prison rap for his gang, a 211F Lancaster is back on Broadway expecting his calculating former partner, the snake-blooded Douglas, to cut him in on his fair share.  Sure, it's not hard-core noir, merely nibbling at the genre.  Still, it delivers a steady, satisfying experience; despite - as Brian (Jersey City) points out - ultimately revealing a predictable soft nougat center by the last reel (or, in this case, the last 150MB).

For me, the ""$8 Dollar Moment""* starts at the 53-minute mark when the post-war corporate gangster, Douglas, painfully exposes to a room full of peers that prohibition-era Lancaster has fallen behind the times.  ""The world has gone right past you,"" Douglas sneers.  ""Today you're finished; as dead as the headlines the day you went to prison.""  This is only a snippet of a fascinating 8-minute scene that painfully cuts the protagonist down a few notches.  [Danny DeVito's scathing rebuttal of Gregory Peck during the point/counterpoint scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Other-People-s-Money/dp/B0006J28N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Other People's Money</a>&nbsp;(1991) has a similar impact].

Downside?  Image and sound quality could be better; a few preachy exchanges between Scott and Lancaster send the saccharine meter north; some head-spinning time compression during the fateful final night.  Still, excellent leads, a strong supporting cast, and a decent script make 'I Walk Alone' a movie worth spending your time with.

Enjoy!

*+/- $8.00 is the current average price for a movie ticket in the USofA.  So, the ""$8 Dollar Moment"" is that point in a picture when one feels they got their money's worth.",1362873600,8,2070,5.8533333333333335
4858995,5,B005QJDFIE,"This is such a populated genre, I have to give 5 stars to a top tier film like this. This is probably one of Burt's greatest performances.  Lizabeth Scott does an excellent job of sexy woman who's always in trouble, but she has smarts and morals and gumption and fantastic sex appeal -total Noire package.  This isn't Kurt's greatest performance, as it can be a bit tenuous at times, but it is fun to see him play the bad guy.  Script is solid.  Good bits of cityscape. Lighting and picture come across good via the streaming service. Weak point is sound quality.  Dialogue comes across great, but the lush score gets washed out and the strings sound quite fuzzy. Just slightly under average for a film of this age.  Excellent watch.  If you love Noire, this is a must see.",1362873600,7,773,4.478571428571429
4858996,5,B005QJDFIE,"If you like a great story and even better acting you'll love this movie. Made at the height of the studio system this movie has it all;action,romance and story. Lancaster is a recently released ex con looking for his share of a club his 'buddy' built while he took the wrap in prison for fourteen years. Douglas doesn't see it quite that way and would prefer Lancaster to take early retirement in a swamp somewhere. Lizabeth Scott provides the off beat sexiness. Who wins? Watch and see. You won't be wasting your time and it's free on Amazon Prime. Man what a movie!",1362268800,,567,4.514563106796117

It doesn't take much to figure out how the plot and characters will develop. Still the film is fun. But SHAME ON AMAZON for the poor video quality.",1362009600,3,325,4.433333333333334

If you like movies from this time watch it!",1506729600,,245,4.23404255319149
8483439,5,B005QJDFIE,"This is one of my favorite film noirs. It is enjoyable watching Burt and Kirk in their first film together, their last was in 1986. IWA was not available on DVD when I wanted to buy it but I did buy the streamed version. I have always enjoyed watching Lizabeth Scott, who was an almost Lauren Bacall lookalike. She was the queen of the noirs and I loved her films. I watch this fine film every few months and I enjoy it more with each viewing.",1498262400,4,443,4.162790697674419
