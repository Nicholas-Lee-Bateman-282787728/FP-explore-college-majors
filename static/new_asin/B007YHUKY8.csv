8523175,5,B007YHUKY8,"I love Timmy time, this show is adorable, and my 2 year old daughter can't take her eyes off it when it's on! There's always a good lesson to learn, and who doesn't love all the cute animal sounds?",1365811200,,197,4.076923076923077
8523176,5,B007YHUKY8,"Got the Timmy Time DVD for my 2 year old, and she loves it!
I may have to get a new DVD player to go with it.

If you haven't checked out Shaun the Sheep or Timmy Time for small children, give it a go--I think Shaun is a brilliant show!",1363651200,,236,3.627450980392157
8523177,5,B007YHUKY8,Timmy Time Books are some of my 2 year old  grandson's favorites.  The pictures are bright and colorful and the stories are such fun.,1352851200,,133,4.5
8523178,5,B007YHUKY8,"My husband loves Shaun the Sheep and my boys of course like whatever he does, Timmy Time is a nice compromise for my preschoolers (4 and 5.)  Timmy Time is a wholesome show featuring Timmy the Sheep and his barnyard friends getting into mischief, having fun, working together and just being kids.  This DVD is cute because it features a birthday party and cake!  It was perfect for my son to watch for his summer birthday, and boy did he laugh!  There are a total of five episodes, all short but sweet!  The animation is like a bright and modern claymation and best of all the characters don't really talk!  Great lessons to be learned including its okay to make mistakes and sharing with your friends.",1344470400,,702,4.531746031746032
