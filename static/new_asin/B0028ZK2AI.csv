8357225,5,B0028ZK2AI,I have been searching for some quality Spanish movies for some time. Growing up in Chicago with only Univision and Telemundo all the Spanish movies they gave were either some badly dubbed english movie or some overacted novela. The plot of the movie is not as scary or gory as one might expect from the title but it is a good plot. More importantly the quality of the film is top notch. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...,1362614400,,434,4.240963855421687

Es una mala copia de REC (qu digo mala, malsima) y en lugar de dar miedo da coraje - acaso nos creern estpidos? -. Te recomiendo mil veces ms ""el orfanato"" o si buscas algo de gore prueba con la serie de ""movies to die for"".",1256428800,,337,4.28125
