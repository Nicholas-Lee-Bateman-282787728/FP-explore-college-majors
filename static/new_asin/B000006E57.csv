7904170,3,B000006E57,"BLOOD MONEY (aka: THE KILLER'S EDGE- 1991) starts off w/ a murderous attack on a counterfeiting outfit, by a gang of goons, led by the odious Miller (Robert Z'Dar- MANIAC COP). Thankfully, the FBI is on the case, led by Agent Barrett (Karen Black- TRILOGY OF TERROR, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES). Barrett reaches out to the cops for assistance. Enter Jack Saxon (Wings Hauser- VICE SQUAD, MUTANT), who gets to work on the case, just as soon as he takes on a bunch of thugs at a restaurant, while simultaneously getting engaged to his girlfriend! A Vietnam connection is suspected, due to the knife used by Miller to kill one of the counterfeiters. Meanwhile, Miller -looking like the man-in-the-moon in a bathrobe- discusses his plans w/ his crew of halfwits. They're trying to locate the lone survivor of their assault, along w/ the plate he took w/ him. Jack and his partner hit the streets in search of clues. Miller, for his part, doesn't fool around, he soon blows up some people w/ his rocket launcher, just for fun! FLASHBACK #1- to the Vietnam war, where Saxon saw action, w/ Miller -looking like a life-sized ventriloquist's dummy in a uniform- as his sergeant. Apparently, no one else was in Vietnam at the time, which resembles someone's back yard. Back in the present, Jack and company ask questions at a pawn shop / bookie joint. Jack can't resist shooting n'er-do-wells like so many armed vermin! Jack gets suspended, and takes up ice skating. Barrett and her FBI cohort -looking like he's been pickled in rum and Tobasco sauce- get a lead, while back at Miller's place, he plays piano -looking like Liberace, trying to swallow a microwave- again, in his bathrobe. This, all while the fugitive counterfeiter, named Manny, admires his girlfriend's artwork. It's good to see how everyone's found a hobby! Hmmmm, wasn't this a crime / thriller, though? Uh oh! I spoke too soon! Miller finds Manny and there's heck to pay! FLASHBACK #2- Jack and Miller are still the only two soldiers in Vietnam. Here and now, can their final showdown be far off? The only trouble is, there's a load of protracted dullness to wade through, before any real action. FLASHBACK #3- Jack and Miller take on the Viet Cong! There's three of them! In the present, Jack calls for a massage. Then, at last! The final conflict we've been fighting sleep to witness! Lots of talk ensues. But wait! That was only the starter finale! The next day... Jack makes his move! The threat of action is in the air! This is it! Jack must face a gauntlet of kung fu and stick fights, before Miller appears -looking like Jay Leno w/ a full set of impacted wisdom teeth, in a hat- and the end begins! Have no fear! There are explosions aplenty! If only there had been more flashbacks!... P.S.- Karen Black fans take heed. She's only in this movie for about four minutes...",1510444800,2,2833,4.679358717434869
7904171,4,B000006E57,"Within the first 10 minutes of a movie a man hides in a cardboard box, I want to stress that this is not the wackiest thing you'll see in this movie. It's not high art in the sense that say Carl Theodore Dryer is. It's solidly low class art if you know what you're looking at. It's a mash up of Miami Vice, Dick Tracey, 70s cop films, Vietnam movies, and Sam Peckinpah style I gotta kill my best friend bonding you can find. If the Coen Brothers had directed this, it'd be hailed as a master piece. Thankfully they didn't and instead you get the full thrust to the face of rock hard cheese that can only be described as pure manliness.

Watch Wings Hauser wander into high stakes robberies on accident. Watch Wings kill without a moments hesitation and realize that they're saying something in a way so basic that any other supposedly smart director would've tripped over themselves trying to say. It's the best comic book movie that isn't a comic book movie that's not named The Fast and The Furious or Prime Cut with Lee Marvin.

In short, they really don't make movies like this anymore. It is too the point and not riddled with faux self doubt like so many movies and in particular action movies are today. A lot of people will stupidly call it boring cause of that but if your idea of fun is wallowing in misery then you're losing more than you realize. It's not the Wings way.",1452556800,,1382,4.373540856031128
7904172,1,B000006E57,"This film is so diabolically bad and such a chore to sit through that writer director Joseph Merhi should pay people to view it, rather than vice versa. Beginning with a counterfeit money print shop being besieged by Robert Z'Dar and his gang of opportunists, we soon follow the FBI in the form of Karen Black and LA police in the form of detective Wings Hauser in their attempt to recover the printing plates and the counterfeit currency. The way in which one of the print shop workers is killed suggests that the killer is a Vietnam veteran, and soon Hauser makes the connection with Z'Dar, his Vietnam commander, via a series of unconvincing wartime flashbacks including a bottle shooting montage. The only compelling thing about this film is Z'Dar's face, which inexplicably looks like the actor has had cheek and chin implants, and who's look is only explained by someone referring to him as having ""a big jaw"". He even sports the same look in the flashbacks, so we can't blame the Vietcong. Hauser is given the annoying habit of repeating questions posed to him as his answer, though his all too few scenes of banter with Black are mildly entertaining. This is the kind of film where scenes with someone standing on a rooftop and in front of a swimming pool get the anticipated payoff, where a person can hide under a cardboard box during the siege of the print store and not be discovered, where the writer's idea of wit is ""There's 458 homicides in LA and you're (Hauser) responsible for over 10% of them"", and ""You got change of a buck? What do I look like - a bank?!"".",996969600,6,1578,4.579505300353357
