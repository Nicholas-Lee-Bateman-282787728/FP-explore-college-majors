7879400,5,6304934394,"Elia Kazan, the film director who brought masterpieces such as Splendor in the Grass, On the Waterfront, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as well as America America to the cinematic screen reveals the inner working of his cinematic talents in this fascinating documentary made by Richard Schickel.  Kazan discusses his discovery of acting greats such as Brando and Dean  and how each of them were allowed to ""act"" in ways quite different than the traditions of acting had demanded before them.  But Kazan's selfless lack of ego allowed the actors a free hand in order to achieve their uniqueness.

Even though he was wrongly castigated by the Hollywood machine for providing names of Hollywood Communists already known to the House UnAmerican Committee in the early 1950s, his self deprecating manner reveals no anger or demand for setting the record straight.  He knows that what he did was the right thing to do.  We should all be grateful for this.  His lengthy journey of film genius is sufficient to elevate him to the pantheon of cinematic giants.

This video is a must for any lover of film history and technique....Kazan did win 2 Academy awards (for On the  Waterfont and Gentlemen's Agreement and many other awards including the prestigious D.W. Griffith Award.)",1126310400,4,1264,4.95260663507109
