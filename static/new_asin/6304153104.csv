797730,4,6304153104,"Shirley Temple starred in her own movies. Other actors were second fiddles. Except for Frank Morgan, Bill Robinson or Jane Withers, being in a Temple movie meant being forgotten. Shirley had the movie to herself. It isn't her fault, these movies were written for her.
But this movie is different in a very good way.

This is not a Shirley Temple movie. Temple gets to actually act with two amazing superstars, Lombard and Cooper. The movies is about Cooper and he is fantastic as a self-aborbed and completely lovable inmature slacker. While he loves his wife, Ms. Lombard, he loves himself first and foremost. Carole Lombard is awesome as his dedicated and loving wife.

When Cooper returns to see if he can milk his brother in law out of $75,000 so that she can be adopted, Cooper shows up to meet Temple and the chemistry between them is what one would expect of a loving daughter meeting a wayward father. Cooper shines as he shows his heart being won over by this little girl, and Temple never overplays it. These two actors had a lifelong bond, and it shows in this movie. You can't fake the love they had for each other.

There are many scenes between Cooper and Temple that play out with such sincerity and emotion you are amazed at what you are seeing. Temple's performance isn't canned or over the top, and Cooper shows a side to him that is endearing. Those two can really act!

Lombard is no slacker either. She is completely believable and holds her own as the second wife of this wayward young widower. As the drama heats up, these three do an excellent job making it all seem quite real.

It is obvious that Temple was headed for superstardom. It is kind of sad that she didn't get more chances to really act in roles that weren't catered to her talents. Had she the chance, I believe she could have been given even more credit than she has held over the years. She would have been given more roles after her kiddie years to show off her amazing acting skills.

I better understand how frustrated Temple became as her movies became ever more famous. She wasn't really given anything after this movie that forced her to stretch her acting muscles and grow as an actress. You can see here in this movie, that she could have been a great adult actress too.",1328227200,,2268,4.519512195121951
797731,5,6304153104,"My wife and her sister have been using ""Honor Bright"" with each other for years. They asked me if I knew where saying ""Honor Bright"" came from. I believe it is from West Point, but the first time I heard it was in the Shirley Temple movie ""Now & Forever"" (1934). That's why I ordered this film. I haven't told them, but I bought two copies of this film and am giving each of them one for Christmas. ---- My wife certainly thinks I've forgotten all about her question! ---- Al",1256774400,,475,4.230769230769231
797732,3,6304153104,"This VHS tape is marketed and sold as a Shirley Temple film, when in fact, the movie was made at Paramount prior to Shirley's star days at 20th Century Fox. It really is a Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard film, which is the reason why I bought it. Cooper is young, extremely charming and very handsome. Likewise, Carole Lombard (yet to find the signature persona of her screwball comedy era at this point) is pretty and likable. This was well worth the few dollars I paid for it. I don't know if it is available on DVD at this point but if it is, it wouldn't be part of the Shirley Temple 20th Century Fox box sets. Since it is one of the 700 or so films that Paramount sold to Universal for television distribution many years ago, no doubt that it would be a Universal Home Video release.",1254700800,,787,4.2885906040268456
797733,5,6304153104,"NOW AND FOREVER is an excellent film that I think most people will enjoy.  Gary Cooper was already a superstar when this movie was released in 1934 but Carole Lombard was rapidly rising and would be a major star by the end of the year as would the amazing six-year-old Shirley Temple.  Some Temple fans may be disappointed that she is not the whole show as normal for Temple vehicles, one person gives the movie a bad review in part because she does not sing but keep in mind Shirley had not yet reached full stardom  and wasn't yet established as singing in her films.  It's not a children's film (although my eight-year-old niece loved it, I bought her a copy) rather a film with a child in one of the leading roles so the whole family can enjoy this vehicle.  Carole Lombard doesn't get to show her wonderful comic talent in this part but she is a gorgeous and talented actress and as always gives a fine performance.  Gary Cooper is definately one of the most dashing men in movies in the 1930's  and of course with two Best Actor Oscars under his belt his talent needs no defense.  And then there's little Shirley, the greatest child actress of all time (yes ALLTIME, despite the hype about recent contenders) as natural as can be and lovable as ever.

This video is ""colorized"" so purists might be disappointed but it's a good coloring job.  This is a good title for the video collections of 1930's film fans.",1130544000,,1415,4.470817120622568
797734,2,6304153104,"Shirley does a wonderful job in this film although there aren't really any flashy song and dance numbers-- you can see her acting talent shine through as she cries after discovering the jewels in her little teddy bear. One of Shirley's earlier films it is one of her better ones.

But, sadly it was ruined by the horrible acting done by the melodramatic acting of her father and her mother in this movie. I felt rather sad for little Shirley for I felt like I was watching child abuse in every scene Shirley was with her father. Not only is her father a liar and a jewel thief but, he seems to have no connection or love for Shirley compared to her many other on screen dads (James Dunn). Really a lack of chemistry is what ruins this film.

But, this film will want to make you cry so I give it only two stars- for when you see a Shirley film you really want a film with classic values and one that will make you want to sing and dance instead of persecute child abusers.",1106697600,2,972,4.220430107526882
797735,4,6304153104,"With a knock-out cast like this movie has, it will almost certainly please lovers of vintage movies. Jerry Day and Toni Carstairs (Cooper & Lombard) are a pair of vagabond thieves in love. On a boat from Shanghai, Jerry receives word from Connecticut that the parents of his dead wife want to take possession of his little daughter, Penelope. Jerry is willing to sell the tyke to his brother-in-law for $75,OOO - but Toni has different ideas....Although this ""Temple film"" isn't exactly ideal for the kids (its theme is really too mature) it will please those who will appreciate the clever antics which ensue. The talented, chubby Alice Faye-like Dorothy Dell was originally supposed to play Lombard's role but she was killed in an auto accident. Dell played the female lead in LITTLE MISS MARKER. If vintage moviegoers saw her sing WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN I'M DREAMING - in SHOOT THE WORKS - you haven't forgotten her. The original title of the source material for this film was entitled HONOR BRIGHT by Jack Kirland and Melville Baker.",1041984000,8,1037,4.831460674157303
797736,4,6304153104,"... I hasten to say that Now and Forever is a worthwhile
film.  Shirley Temple gives a great performance with memorable scenes
and lines, as in ""Oh, Daddy, you said Honor Bright,"" when Cooper, as
her father, breaks a promise.
Gary Cooper is trying hard not to be
completely villanous,and he has his daughter's best interests at
heart.  My favorite thing about the movie is the way it shows life as
being more complicated than just right vs. wrong.  That a child is
affected by grownup vices seems realistic to me.
No easy answers,
and good acting.  I loved it.",1019088000,15,560,4.57
797737,2,6304153104,"My entire family disliked this movie and found it inappropriate for children.  First of all, Gary Cooper is featured much more than Shirley Temple, and Shirley seems tired throughout most of movie, especially during her dull, listless song and dance routine.  Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard were not able to rise above their unrealistic, jaded dialogue, which failed to make them sympathetic characters nor explain why they'd chosen a life of swindling and double-dealing.
I think several events in this movie would be disturbing to children: Gary Cooper's attempt to sell his daughter for a large sum of money, his theft of a valuable necklace and his lies to his daughter about it, his murder of another man, and finally his supposedly selfless act in giving his daughter to a wealthy old woman--without telling his daughter that she was being given away!
This movie could have had some redeeming value if the Gary Cooper character had undergone a true reformation.  Carole Lombard's character does but then essentially becomes a filler role.  The ending is quite depressing, because it offers no hope for their family.  Perhaps one positive aspect is that it does demonstrate the consequences of one's actions, but I still don't see that children would enjoy or be uplifted by a movie featuring as many serious crimes and breaches of ethics as this one.",1017792000,11,1356,5.0088888888888885
797738,3,6304153104,"Well for a while in this movie (the beginning) Shirley hasn'came on the screen yet and you wonder,is this the right movie ? But it later is ,as she is cute little Penny Day. I think in this movie she really is adorable,although she always is in this movie she is even more precious. I think the most touching thing in the movie is when she finds out her daddy stole the necklace,when she finds it on her bear. She breaks into a crying scene which I think is so sad. "" Oh Daddy,and you said Honor Bright"" says young Penny. The movie isn't the most interesting movie but I wouldn't miss it just because of that. Some scenes in the movie look very fake like the rollercoaster,but then remember this is the 30's ,you're lucky they made movies! I would also say if your looking for one which Shirley Temple totally stars in this isn't exactly the one. Although she's in it,it's not exactly her movie. The movie follows Gary Cooper mainly but she's in it alot though. I wouldn't recomend this movie as great but I wouldn't recomend it as horrible. But I do recomend it for you to see. I hope you find this helpful.",997574400,4,1108,4.331730769230769
797739,5,6304153104,"Now and Forever is just a wonderful movie to sit down and watch with family and friends. It is heartwarming, sweet, and funny. It is about a girl named Penny who lives with her mother's rich and selfish brother. The girl's mother died when she was just a baby and her father makes a living by being a jewel thief. Penny is sent to live with her uncle. Then her father sends a letter telling the uncle that he has decided that he wants to raise his daughter. The uncle ends up sending him a letter saying that he will pay him if he will allow Penny to stay with him instead. So her father goes to talk with his brotherinlaw about Penny. While Penny's father is trying to talk with his brotherinlaw he has to decide if he wants the money or if he wants his daughter back to raise Penny himself. Later Penny's father sees her playing outside by the lake and he goes outside to play with her. When Penny sees him she asks what his name is and he tells her that his name is Jerry. Penny then asks Jerry if he would play with her. Jerry tells her that he will and starts playing with her. Jerry then finds out how much he loves his daughter and wants to set a good example for her. After Penny and Jerry finish playing, Jerry tells her that she is his daughter. Penny tells him that she is so proud that he his her father. Jerry and Penny go back in the house and Jerry tells his brotherinlaw that he has made up his mind and that he wants to raise Penny. Jerry and his new wife end up raising Penny and they become a very happy family.  I will just finish  by saying that they live to become a very happy family. There is much more to the movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie with family and friends. This is a movie that people must see as a family.",988156800,4,1752,4.104956268221574
7863528,5,6304153104,"Caught in between Gary Cooper and Carol Lombard we find Shirley Temple.  While not the commanding presence that she has in later films, she is apparently being groomed for future roles.  The story is interesting and complex enough, though every time I see Gary Cooper in a less demanding role than that of ""High Noon,"" I am a bit disappointed.  I give this film 5 stars for its brilliant, vivid colorization.  This is the best colorized movie I have yet seen.  It truly rivals technicolor in quality.  Even if the story isn't quite your cup of tea, I say buy it and enjoy one of the best restoration/supplementation efforts ever.",1517011200,,629,4.672727272727273
7863529,5,6304153104,"What a sweet movie!  I so enjoy watching stars of yesteryear, especially ones that were really 'stars'.  Carol Lombard, long tall Gary Cooper and dimpled cutie Shirley Temple are simply engaging.  I had never heard of this picture and it's not included in the Shirley Temple collections that have been released.  I came across it by chance - saw the cover photo.

I really enjoyed watching her in this movie. I also like Carole Lombard in this - she was better in this than other movies I've seen her in. Gary Cooper seemed wooden in this movie, but maybe that was just the way he acted.

7863533,4,6304153104,"The sunny, featherweight musical was more Shirley Temple's jam, but, once in a blue moon, she did mess around with other film genres. Now and Forever is a sentimental melodrama from 1934 that chronicles how a con man's love for his little daughter rehabilitates him. It's a high-powered cast that assembles Temple, Gary Cooper, Carole Lombard, and director Henry Hathaway.

""Chasing trains"" is the euphemism that Jerry Day (Cooper) and Toni Carstairs (Carole Lombard) use to refer to their shady lifestyle. For the past few years, Jerry and Toni had been living it up overseas, ever on the move, merrily swindling their marks. But, of late, Toni's gotten weary of chasing trains, describing her life ""cheap and gaudy and shallow."" And then arrives that catalyst for change. Jerry reveals to Toni that he has a 5-year-old daughter named Penelope in Connecticut, that he's contemplating giving up custody of her to his brother-in-law for the asking price of $75,000. Toni is aghast that he'd even consider giving up his daughter. But, to Jerry, money is money, yo.

Except never underestimate the potency of an enchanting curly-haired moppet. When push comes to shove, Jerry Day couldn't give up his kid, especially to the no fun police that is his brother-in-law. Jerry vows to go straight, and, so, there's him and Toni and Penny, that happy family. But Jerry learns it ain't so easy turning over a new leaf. Someone observant observes: ""You don't make much money, and you spend a lot. Now that sounds like adventure to me. And, if that's true, Penny will get in your way someday."" Is there anything more awful than a little girl finding out her da is a crook?

6-year-old Shirley doesn't sing or dance in this one. What's showcased instead is the scope of her acting. Shirley, full of personality, may just be the most precocious child performer ever onscreen. Here, she demonstrates her versatility, her ability to carry a droll note one moment but then command the screen in a dramatic scene. Her weepy remark, when she suspects her dad of thievery, simply wrecks your heart: ""Daddy... and you said 'Honor bright' to me."" Gary Cooper, for his part, makes for an engaging scoundrel. You can't help but like his character even when his grown-up vices reduce his child to tears. I feel Carole Lombard is sort of wasted here, even though she's strong in those soap opera moments. But she gets no chance to show off her comedienne skills. Now and Forever is darker and more mature than Shirley's other films. Still, it's must-see cinema for the fact that it stretches Shirley's range into drama. She really was a wunderkind who could do it all. And the awesome thing is, when she grew up, she kept her poise. She became an ambassador to Ghana and to Czechoslovakia. She certainly didn't lose her damn mind and go on stage to twerk like a damn fool. Yeah, I went there.",1436918400,,2866,4.785858585858586
