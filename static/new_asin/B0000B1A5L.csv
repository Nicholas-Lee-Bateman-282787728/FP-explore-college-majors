The action is pretty good and the fight scenes are nice too until the very end, When the laws of physics and gravity are somewhat ignored. The villian(who has a vast following)I thought was nicely done, but for some reason shows up in an obscure little European country that, also for some strange reason is filled with a lot of chinese also. Another problem I had with this film is the notion that whoever took part in Tiananmen Square betrayed thier country. If anything I think they were trying to save it.",1235865600,,682,4.294573643410852
