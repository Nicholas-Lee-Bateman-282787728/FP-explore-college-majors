8359372,5,B002AFXDH0,"Susan Sarandon plays a fantastic role that everybody played there roles so convincingly that  it's so real, You were in the movie with them, The story is of action, determination to survive and live to tell their story. It's about the war in the Pacific, Not overdone and I have given it an A plus. It's a must see not knowing whats going to happen next, sitting on the edge of your seat suspense, This movie would make a difference to your feelings about war and the sacrifices that was made for our future. A marvellous dvd to watch sitting on your favourite chair with a few munchies and a drink, Great show to share with your comfort pillow next to you. I strongly recommend this movie to all and I will not ruin it by telling you everything about it. So enjoy and get with it now.",1334534400,2,785,4.304054054054054
