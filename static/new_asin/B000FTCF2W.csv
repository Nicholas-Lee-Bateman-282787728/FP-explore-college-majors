2585299,4,B000FTCF2W,"When we are just at the eve of the opening of the World soccer championship, ""Real is far beyond a simple referential documental. It's an emotive attempt for explaining and describing what are the factors that make this club be so beloved, admired and well known all around the world.

The script is by itself multidimensional. A humble kid in Senegal, a promising female soccer player in NYC, a marvelous resemblance in Caracas when three generations are gathered when a teenager, a Real Madrid's fan be aware his grandfather was the kidnapper of Di Stefano, a painful incident in that city in the early sixties, a Japanese girl who is in love with Beckam, the scrutinize of an intellectual in Madrid trying the find the basic clues that originate such emotional vehemence and finally the memories of a septuagenarian widow. These vignettes are obviously intermingled with memorable historical moments and unforgettable insights of this legendary team: Real Madrid football club.",1276128000,,980,5.125
2585300,1,B000FTCF2W,This is a horrible attempt at a fictional movie about some characters who's stories somehow touch on Real Madrid.  Even the most diehard of Real Madrid fans shouldn't waste their time buying or renting this one to watch.,1191801600,,220,4.7894736842105265
2585301,1,B000FTCF2W,"As a Real Madrid Fan i thought i would really enjoy this but i didn't enjoy it as much as i thought i was.  I guess i expected more of a documentary where i was going to get to see more behind the scenes footage with players as they prepare for the match or the season.

You get what the title says - a MOVIE based on the team with cuts as they train for the macth against Barcelona.  The movie was a bit corny and im definatley going to sell this.",1179705600,,448,3.847826086956522
2585302,5,B000FTCF2W,"This is a must for Real Madrid fans, is a very different view of the club its inner workings preparation and so on. Also the storiesa are very well presented and give you an overview of how big this club is and how far is his impact in the world of today!!!",1179014400,,257,3.9615384615384617
2585303,5,B000FTCF2W,"the passion, the fans, the players; Zidane, Ronaldo, Raul, Becks, Guti, Figo, it is a WOW movie for all Madrid fans,, for all football fans, not as cheezy as you would think, very good movie indeed, FUNNY, SAD, HONOUR,,, get it and you'll see! thank you",1173830400,,253,4.521739130434782
2585304,5,B000FTCF2W,"A film for ALL soccer fans, not just Real Madrid's.  Hala Madrid!

There is another film that all soccer fans would love: it is called ""Historias de Futbol"" but I have never seen it advertised.  It comes up on TV's Spanish channels now and then.  If you see itm buy it - it is another 5-star production!",1172448000,2,303,4.2631578947368425
2585305,5,B000FTCF2W,Nice Movie for one of my Favorites Team,1163030400,,39,4.0
2585306,4,B000FTCF2W,It is a good movie - for the purpose.  In that it is a movie about a famous soccer club - which I personally is a huge fan of - that quite charmingly attempts to see why it is so loved - by all different kinds of people all over the world. I enjoyed it.,1442016000,,253,3.6

2585312,4,B000FTCF2W,"I wasn't sure quite what to expect.  I see how the format/style of this film might be a little off-putting to some, but overall, it was a collection of various stories/ideas of what real Madrid meant to different people.  All the while, weaving in the past and the present of this highly successful organization.  I certainly wouldn't call watching this a waste of time, and I'm glad I did.  You should give it at least 10-15 minutes to see if it's for you (if you turn off it off too soon, you might miss the bigger meaning/benefit of the film).",1382745600,,546,4.43
2585313,5,B000FTCF2W,"Very well done.  Entertaining, yet goes into what the team has to do to prepare for the games.  Nice story line.  I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again.",1382486400,,160,4.266666666666667
2585314,1,B000FTCF2W,"I understand the director's passion for Real Madrid. However, this film was a jumble. It didn't seem to know its identity - Was it a bunch of human stories that all have a common link (e.g. Crash)? Was it a documentary about Real Madrid? If so, about the current team or its history? Was it about one man's quest to answer a question about the team's fans? Rather than making a choice the film includes all these themes - and doesn't do it well. The movie doesn't flow. It skips around without any real sense of direction. Why add the Japanese anime?! The documentary footage is as confusing - bouncing from the current team and its preparations to the team's history from the 1st European Cup. It wasn't until mid-way through the film that SOME cohesion arose, in the timeline for preparation of the upcoming game with Barcelona.

I had rented this movie to learn more about Real Madrid. Out of this 90-minute film, what little I did learn was through a very confused, disjointed medium.",1332028800,,988,4.613636363636363
