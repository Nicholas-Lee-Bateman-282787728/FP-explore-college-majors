2367438,5,B000A6T1M2,"Bloody Mallory is a wild ride, with a Tranny in the back seat.  She fights evil with the help of a Transvestite and locks horns with the most evil force on earth: The Church....no, wait, she is trying to Save The Pope.

Ah well, she fights the lesser evil: the demons, and struggles to rescue the greater evil: the pope.  Bloody Mallory is a campy, yet serious (sort of) film that may leave you scratching your head at times.  Action sequences, weird car rides, and ghostly encounters abound.

If, for some strange reason, you do not enjoy the film as much as I did you can frame the cover photo.  Other reviewers covered the basics, so I am just throwing in my two cents.  This movie is weird, but unique and probably a cult classic.",1206144000,2,734,4.392592592592592
2367439,3,B000A6T1M2,"At first I thought this film had too many elements. It has a special team that fight demons, each with their own skills. It has demons. It has a vampire. And, it has the pope. Yet, all these things just seem to work, because it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously.

It has the always hot Valentina Vargas as a vampire, who, when she feeds you actually see the victim's arm collapsing/deflating from lack of fluid!",1154131200,2,425,4.448717948717949
2367440,5,B000A6T1M2,"This is a great little French movie.  I was lucky enough to see it on a cinema screen while living in the UK where it screened at a horror film festival called Fright Fest.  And while the film is now at least 4 years old, it's well worth the wait to finally have on DVD with English subtitles. (It's been available in France for some time on DVD but to my knowledge without any subtitles, and also in Thailand).

Bloody Mallory was described as ""Indiana Jones meets Buffy"" - and while it's got its share of adventure set pieces, this is more a clever enjoyable horror/comedy than an action film.

Basic storyline finds our lead heroine Mallory who is an special agent in an Occult division of a government agency.  She's got major issues with demons as we find out she had to kill her husband on their wedding night when it turned out he was in fact a demon - who despite being dead ""haunts"" Mallory throughout the movie.  Mallory works alongside a colour assortment of characters, including a ""Talking Tina"" - a 12 year old psychic girl and a 7 foot American Drag Queen (who provides some great one-liners).  Throw in a plot about a kidnap of the Pope with vampires, demons and sacrifices, and you get the idea of Bloody Mallory.

The film has a great look and style, and has some cool creature and gore effects, along with some great costumes and fun performances from the cast.  Never taking itself seriously for one moment, Bloody Mallory is a great popcorn flick that deserves to be seen by a wider audience.  It's not going to be to everyones tastes, but if you're a fan of B Grade, Shlock/camp films, this is for you.

I'd have love to have seen a sequel or series of films  follow.  You could definately see franchise potential, but i guess being a independant French film limits the mass appeal and audience for a follow up.  Shame as i can't think of another film that probably is more deserved of a sequel in this day and age when ever the crappiest films get a sequel.

For trainspotters, the director also made a short film with Lisa Wilcox (known to horror fans as ""Alice"" from Nightmare On Elm Street 4 & 5) that was meant to be developed into a full feature, but i'm not aware if this ever happened.  And sorry i can't remember the title either...

A fun, cool tongue in cheek movie.",1124323200,9,2299,4.422802850356295

8074959,1,B000A6T1M2,"DIALOG IS NOT IN ENGLISH ONLY THE SUBTITLES

This is what would happen if ( Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Indiana Jones, and a kids show ) smoked crack hooked up and had a love child muwhahaha, the costumes are like something from a kids show. In all honesty I was disappointed the dialog is all French which is a beautiful languaga but I hate having to put it on hold to read the frickin subtitles it kills the fun of watching it largely for me because while listening I love to watch the facial expressions when something happens, subtitles are kinda fast, I only made it through about 20 minutes and did not finish it. The actors are cool, but this is not a good film, by the summary and the picture I thought it would have a little ( Tomb Raider ) type action

On a more positive note

I do feel bad for the actress playing Mallory I think she is awesome and deserves a way better movie than this so do her costars. I really do like the actors they're very talanted are awesome and did a great job with what they had to work with",1374796800,,1029,4.160804020100502
8074960,2,B000A6T1M2,"I wasn't expecting much but I was expecting more.  I knew I was going to get a bit of a dumb, cheesy, horror/comedy flick with sub-titles and a heroine that was pleasant to look at.  In short, a French Elvira for those that remember the old 80's movie.  It was close to all that, and it wasn't drudgery to watch, but it just fell short of the mark.  Not enough, or not good enough, humor for a comedy.  Too cartoony and ineffectual monsters for a horror.  A weak plot, not enough quips from the protagonists, and a very weak back story for the main character that left me wondering, ""what is actually her story?""  I mean, is she a super powered hero a-la Buffy, or just some jaded ex-bride a-la Kill Bill that trained to fight somewhere we are never told about.  Frankly I was at least expecting better fight choreography.  All in all I suppose it was mildly entertaining, but only just, and I would have been happier spending my time watching something else and letting this one go by.",1364083200,,986,4.403314917127072
8074961,3,B000A6T1M2,"When the pope is kidnapped by a gang of ghouls, it is up to Mallory and her team of supernatural exterminators to battle their way through the bounds of Hell in order to save His Holiness! BLOODY MALLORY drops the fast-paced action of a Japanese animation into a Gothic Horror setting for an energetic and highly entertaining mix of martial arts and dark comedic horror. Julien Magnat shows no lack of ambition behind the camera, transcending the film's small budget with his emphasis on style and production design. The flashy costumes and eccentric characters give us the look and feel of a live-action comic book, but with sharp dialog that is more akin to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series. French phenom Olivia Bonamy stars as the sexy demon slayer, proving to be just as fit for the role as any Sarah Michelle Gellar or Milla Jovovich. When it comes to Horror Comedies, BLOODY MALLORY is a gory good time!

8074962,4,B000A6T1M2,"I like this movie, because it was weird-like horror/comedy movie. Speaking French, it makes it that much weird. The characters seem like a mishmash but that get the job done. Sort of like Buffy Vampire Slayer stuff, though Mallory isn't a hottie as much was Sarah Michelle Gellar.",1293148800,,280,4.854166666666667

Of course, but lots of fun! We get demons, ghouls, vampires, telepaths, a lovely transvestite w/ machine gun shoes, the pope, and a pink hearse!

8074964,5,B000A6T1M2,"great movie, but watch it in french with the english subtitles to get the best effect.the english translation makes you think of the batman tv series from the 1960's,almost a mocking overtone, while the french version allows you to hear mallory's serious,sexy,sultry voice...and i bought the soundtrack which is a combo of french disco with vietnamese influence and scary arabic music.. hope they make a sequel one day.",1254787200,,419,5.176470588235294
8074965,3,B000A6T1M2,"This super indie from France is exactly what you might expect.  It is pretty cheesy, kinda funny and very entertaining.  There is an element of gore involved, and the plot is not the most original one ever...but for the little bit of nothing you can get it for...it is worth a pruchase.",1231372800,,286,4.480769230769231
8074966,4,B000A6T1M2,If any of you have seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer than you will enjoy this action oriented little gem of a movie. Of course i mean the TV series not the movie. The plot isn't anything to scream about but it's the action and how it actually feels like a tv movie that makes this a horror gem that it is. Rent it 1st but it's actually a keeper.,1209859200,,341,3.9565217391304346
