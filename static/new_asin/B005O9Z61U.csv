8480976,5,B005O9Z61U,"This movie has some technical problems. The chase in the mountains to begin the movie is so poorly staged that it really stands out against how incredible this story is. A bounty hunter sets out to find three people responsible for a long ago robbery and he believes they're all holed up as respectable citizens of a nowhere town. Of course he falls in love while he's there and of course the girl's family is somehow connected making it a more dangerous situation for everyone. But what absolutely shocked me was who the real robbers were. We find out along with the bounty hunter and in this aspect, the script was incredible well beyond its Saturday matinee b feature relegation.  Randolph Scott will always be my favorite cowboy star but if this had had even more money behind it and Gregory Peck or Gary Cooper starring it probably wouldn't be such a forgotten gem today. Get it!",1413504000,,884,4.630573248407643
8480977,5,B005O9Z61U,This was for a long time a very hard movie to obtain. I did manage to acquire a video of it but not too good quality sadly. happily it became available on DVD so I bought it. Excellent story line as it's a thinking type western not just a 'shoot-em-uo' type like so many! there's a neat twist at the end too! Worthwhile as part of my collection.,1385164800,,345,4.088235294117647
