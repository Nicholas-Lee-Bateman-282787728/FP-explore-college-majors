8400328,4,B003M9877E,"MANUELA & MANUEL is a bit of fluff from Puerto Rico that is a finely written (Jos Ignacio Valenzuela), well-directed (Ral Marchand Snchez) take off on one of the most popular French farces of the past decades -LA CAGE AUX FOLLES.  It is highly entertaining, boasts some very fine performances by a solid cast, and manages to make fun of itself at the same time.  This is entertainment without a hidden agenda.

Manuel (Humberto Busto) has always lived as Manuela, a drag queen full of energy and talent whose job in the local nightclub is secure along with his fellow 'lady performer' Fararona (Marian Pabon). But in private his heart is broken because the love of his life Ramon (Johnny Lozada) has left him.  His best friend Coca (Elena Iguina) confides in him that she is pregnant by a soldier off to war and wants to keep her child, asking Manuela to act as the father of the child when she confesses her problem to her parents.  Challenged by the masculine role he would have to play, Manuela emphasizes the Manuel persona and agrees to help his friend.  When, dressed in a men's clothes by his landlady Rosa (Luz Mara Rondn) whose life is spent waiting for a letter from a man she lost, he presents to Coca's parents German (Sunshine Logroo) and Norma (Marisol Calero) and  Coca announces that she and Manuel are to be married!  All manner of hilarious mistaken identities occur and secrets are revealed and the 'marriage' opens many doors to the 'superb' finale!

The music an the cinematography are excellent, making the entire story feel as though it were a successful staged musical comedy. MANUELA & MANUEL sparkles.  Grady Harp, September 10",1284249600,,1653,4.7282229965156795
