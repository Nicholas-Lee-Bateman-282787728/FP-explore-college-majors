4514152,2,B0050FYLIW,"The description promised parts of the ballet,AB school students demonstration in between and tea party after "" the ballet is over"". Instead the ""after ballet is over"" party, there are little girls trying to dance in between ballet parts and ""student from AB demonstration"" and that fills about 1/3 of the movie.
All the pieces and comments are repeated twice - my 4yr old found that very annoying and even started crying that she already have seen this.
The ballet and ""students demonstration"" were good but if you would divide by 2 the length of the DVD (to compensate for repeating parts) and minus 1/3 of what's left (for little girls movements )- that would be the time of any valuable info on the DVD(15 min max).
It maybe a good one to watch for 2-3 yr old, but on the other hand, the actual ballet terms and the ballet itself, probably, would be too advanced for that age group.",1326672000,,885,4.5375
4514153,4,B0050FYLIW,"This is a nice video to give young children an understanding of the storyline before they attend an actual performance.  It is narrated, which is nice, so my 6 yr old knew what was going on the whole time.  Sitting in balcony seats at an actual ballet performanence makes it difficult to know what is going on if you don't already know the story (especially if you are only 6!) I bought this specifically so my daughter could see it before we attend the Joffrey performance tomorrow.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because periodically they take a ""break"" and show little girls practicing various ballet steps, which was cute, but the breaks were too long and repetitive in my opinion, especially if your child has never taken ballet.  If you have a budding ballerina, you and she/he will probably love those parts.  Individual preference!  It was around an hour, which was perfect although like I said, if they didn't drag out the ""breaks"", it would have been 45 min which would have been even better.  All in all, my daughter and I enjoyed it.",1324857600,,1059,4.571428571428571
4514154,5,B0050FYLIW,My 3 year old granddaughter will watch and dance to the Prima Princessa DVD's all day if I let her. She loves them and has learned so much. We just went to see the Sacramento Ballet Nutcracker Saturday and she said (a little too loudly) LOOK grandma She just did Pique Attitude! I highly recommend any of these.,1323648000,,311,4.379310344827586
4514155,5,B0050FYLIW,My daughter absolutely loved this DVD.  It was great seeing her identify with complex ballet terms by seeing them explained to her in an easier fashion and taught.  She had a wonderful time dancing around to the instructional sections.  My son also takes Hip Hop and was also very interested in the video and may have done a plie or two.  Even the dog got in to it when he saw dogs on the screen chasing balls around to illustrate chasse.  Great stocking stuffer for any ballerina in your family!,1322611200,3,496,4.466666666666667
4514156,5,B0050FYLIW,"This is my daughter's third year taking ballet class and she loves dancing.  The big recital is the highlight of her year and she loves watching the other performances almost as much as being in one herself.  She is mesmerized by the dancers and now with the latest Prima Princessa release she can experience the excitement at home whenever she wants.

This is our third Prima Princessa DVD and it's by far our favorite one!  I think it's because she was already familiar with both story of Sleeping Beauty and the ballet's music.  She could anticipate what was going to happen and of course, she loved dancing along with the students from the School of American Ballet.

Like the previous Prima Princess titles it features beautiful scenes from the ballet, this time performed by England's famous Royal Ballet.  Viewers can experience the beautiful scenery and artistry of the dancers without a transatlantic flight.  The animated character of Prima Princess narrates the ballet and then leads the viewer through some simple ballet steps.  Children are given the chance to learn ballet vocabulary and practice their steps.  It's nice how the Prima Princessa Presents Sleeping Beauty DVD gets dancers up and moving.  I also liked that a different ballet company is featured from the other two DVDs.  It's nice to see the various different styles of productions.",1321488000,4,1361,5.0
4514157,5,B0050FYLIW,"My two daughters, 2 and 4 years old, loved this DVD.  We already had Prima Princessa's Swan Lake and Nutcracker, and this one was great too.  It inspired both of them to don a tutu and dance around the living room.  Even though the little one is too young to really understand the dance steps, she still has fun with it.  It's such a good price, and would make a nice gift or rainy day/playdate activity.  There are even craft ideas at the end, which could spark a fun project when it's over.",1319068800,,492,4.247311827956989
4514158,5,B0050FYLIW,"My 3 year old was so happy to receive Prima Princessa Presents Sleeping Beauty for her to review. I didn't even get it out of the envelope before she knew what it was. The envelope had the Prima Princessa Logo on it and she grabbed it out of my hand and said my ballerina, my ballerina. I took it out of the package and she ran to the living room and jump in the chair and said Please I want to watch. She will watch these DVD's all day long if I would let her.

She loves to practice the steps they teach in these videos. They teach each step in a very easy way that a child from age 3 and up can understand it. This DVD is great for children to interact with. They can get up and dance around when it time to do so and when it is time for the ballet to start my little automatically sits down and watches each scene.

My little one loves the Prima Princessa Videos so much that we now have all three (Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake, The Nutcracker & Sleeping Beauty) and she watches them over and over again. She knows exactly where we keep them on our DVD shelf and she will pick these off the shelf first when we ask her what do you want to watch.

She bugged me to buy her wings so she could wear them like the little girls in her video. We also picked up some tissue paper and pipe cleaners to make flowers like they show you how to make on this video...  This video ""Sleeping Beauty"" had fun crafts and magical tea party that my daughter loved. She had to even set her tea party up while she was watching the DVD.

I am so impressed and happy with these great DVD's that I have purchased the Nutcracker several times as gifts for my friends little girls birthdays and I'm sure I will be purchasing Sleeping Beauty a lot for gifts as well. They make a wonderful birthday present or even great stocking stuffers at Christmas. These DVD's make a great inexpensive gift for any child.

The giveaway copy of The Nutcracker will be sent to the winner directly from Prima Princessa Productions, LLC.

4514159,5,B0050FYLIW,"Considering I only have one girl out of my 6 children, I'm surprised how much ballet and tutus fill my home....

Princess Ashley loves to dance.
She loves ballet.
And we all love Prima Princessa.

primaprincessalogo
Her DVD's are treasured.
I don't blame her.
The beautiful costumes, graceful ballerinas, and fun lessons are every girl's dream come true!

And thanks to my sweet friends Mary Kate Mellow and Stephanie Troeller, creators of Prima Princessa, we have added the newest DVD release to our collection.

Prima Princessa Presents Sleeping Beauty is filled with snippits of The Royal Ballet's beautiful production of that classic tale, guided along by our favorite animated Prima Princessa fairy, and lessons in between acts to learn simple ballet steps straight from the performance.

Don't forget the bonus arts and crafts feature, and magical tea party!
Your dancer will be most certainly begging for an encore!

And just so you know, despite the fact that this DVD was created for ages 3-6, I my 7 year old ballerina still thoroughly enjoys it. :o)

For any princess at heart who loves dancing, Prima Princessa Presents Sleeping Beauty is a wonderful way to bring out the ballerina at heart!
And it's only $6.99!!!!
I'm thinking stocking stuffers!",1318464000,4,1259,5.053140096618358
4514160,5,B0050FYLIW,"My children (Boy-5, Girl-2) love this DVD! It's a genius way to introduce small children to the classic ballets. Scenes from the actual ballet are narrated for the children's understanding. The scenes from the ballet are interspersed with easy ballet tutorials and scenes with little ballerinas frolicking happily. Being a life-long ballet fan myself, I sit and watch with the kids! I immediately ordered ""The Nutcracker"" version of Prima Princessa.",1404864000,,449,5.428571428571429
4514161,5,B0050FYLIW,I bought this for my Grand baby.  She's two years old and the dance steps are easy for her to follow.,1402963200,,101,3.8095238095238093
4514162,5,B0050FYLIW,I purchased this DVD for a co-worker's daughter and was told that she absolutely loved it because she is now taking lessons and this DVD is helping her tremendously.,1396137600,,165,4.724137931034483
4514163,3,B0050FYLIW,"I got this DVD for my 4-year-old daughter, who loves the Prima Princessa Nutcracker and Swan Lake DVDs.  She was really excited to watch Sleeping Beauty, but we didn't even make it through the first half because she was so unsettled by the ""evil fairy"" character in the ballet.  The costumes and makeup are stunning, and fascinating for an older audience, but I could easily see why it would be so disturbing to younger children, especially those who tend to be more sensitive to portrayals of evil or strong conflict in the media.

I don't have an issue with the ballet itself, but rather with the choice by Prima Princessa to feature this particular ballet for its DVDs.  The DVDs are obviously marketed to preschool-aged kids, and there was no indication on the packaging-- in the description or the images-- of such potentially disturbing material for the younger age-group.",1357948800,5,878,4.87248322147651
4514164,4,B0050FYLIW,"Prima Princessa presents ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a DVD about ballerinas from NCircle; ideal for the young dancer! I thought this would be great for my three-year old daughter Paige that is interested in ballet.  It came along at a perfect time because I've been wanting to put her in dance classes but wasn't sure if she would really be into it and didn't want to spend a lot of money to find out. I was curious to see if this would give me an indication into her potential success!

I love that this is narrated by a cartoon fairy, which immediately draws the attention of toddlers.  She drops into view occasionally to bring them back when they start to lose interest. A real ballet, Sleeping Beauty, is performed from London and the narrator explains the story behind the ballet as well as the steps that they are doing.  It then shows ballerinas doing the step explained in a studio environment and then dancers around my daughter's age doing the steps making it relatable to her.

I found it a bit distracting to go back and forth between the professional ballet, the ballerinas and the toddler ballerinas (Prima Princessa's).  However, for toddlers with short attention span this is actually a benefit because they never lose interest. Paige was up and dancing during the explanation of steps and then would stare in awe when it went back to the professional ballet.

If there is a little girl in your life that's interested in ballet this would make a fun Christmas gift!  It's a cost effective way to find out if a child is interested in the actual dance and not just the fantasy of being a ballerina, without taking expensive classes to find out! The bonus features make it even more of a value!",1353801600,,1701,4.6092715231788075
4514165,5,B0050FYLIW,"My munchkins are both ballerinas and love this DVD!  They get so excited to watch it.  It is really great because it teaches steps to kids in a way that is very easy to learn.  The girls love it because they are taking ballet classes.

This is such a great DVD and their friends love watching it too!  It is a sleepover favorite!",1349049600,,329,4.158730158730159
4514166,5,B0050FYLIW,I bought this for my daughter because she loves to dance and she loves music. It's really cute and starts with a group of girls sitting about to watch the ballet. Then the ballet starts and there's explanations as to what's going on. My son did not care for it much he's only three but my daughter liked the music and was interested.,1341878400,,333,4.301587301587301
4514167,4,B0050FYLIW,"My 5 year old daughter loves this movie. she says her favorite parts are, ""Everything!"" She wants more videos in this series. I like that the movie is interesting during the performances and fun during the ballet lessons. It is a little difficult for her so this video may be best for girls a little bit older (the only reason why I gave it 4 stars). This is a very beautiful movie so I would recommend it to anybody else who wants a ballet video for their kids. MUCH better then other ballet videos we have purchased.",1341878400,,518,4.350515463917525
4514168,5,B0050FYLIW,"We saw the nutcracker version on tv over Christmas and my 20 month old loved it. Wouldnt stop jumping for hours. She is definitely too young to understand all the instruction on the dvd, but loves copying the little girls. I think it's a grow into video, but we both enjoy watching it and dancing to it.",1330732800,,303,4.333333333333333
4514169,3,B0050FYLIW,"My 5 year old LOVES the Prima Princessa Nutcracker dvd so I assumed she'd love this one too.  Although she's very outgoing and confident, she does seem to be a little more 'sensitive' than other kids her age to the *evil* characters portrayed in Disney movies etc.  So she doesn't like this ballet because of the 'evil fairy' who puts everyone to sleep.  She's watched it once and doesn't want to see it again.  Such a pity since these DVD's are so cute.  For some reason the rats in the Nutcracker are OK but the evil fairy is not!  Who can reason with a 5 year old?  Maybe I'll try the Swan Lake one instead.",1328745600,6,610,4.252173913043478

8451162,5,B0050FYLIW,"My girls love this!!! They can have ""ballet class"" anytime! I Highly recommend Prima Princessa if you have a little princess or prince that is enthusiastic about dance. Every child can only benefit from the fundamentals of ballet as it helps to promote a life long interest in physical activity. Get your kids UP off the couch and moving EASILY with this movie! Who knows, maybe they'll even take a nap for you after they tire themselves out?!",1459468800,,443,4.6923076923076925

8451166,5,B0050FYLIW,"My 3 year old daughter loves the movie ""Sleeping Beauty"", so this captured her from the start. The costumes are beautiful. I love going to the ballet, but I don't feel it's exciting enough for a child to literally sit still for the entire production. This is such a wonderful way to not only introduce dance to your little one, but its just enough actual ballet footage to get them excited about the arts. I recommend this for any little dancer. Even my boys who are 5 & 6 sat to watch, so this is just a great intro for all kids.

8451167,4,B0050FYLIW,"My little girl (4-1/2 years old) is taking ballet classes, and we watched this as an introduction to real ballet performances. She was already familiar with the story, which is quite similar to Jim Weiss' audio version. She enjoyed the movie very much. I liked the narration, as it can be difficult to follow a ballet. It is very repetitive, but that didn't seem to bother her much. We may try the Nutcracker one next.",1417737600,,418,4.586666666666667
