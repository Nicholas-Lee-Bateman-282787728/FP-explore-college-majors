1840767,5,B00008DYQ5,"Once again Barney has done a fantastic job teaching our children ""living"" skills that will help them on the playground, in school and in real life interaction with friends and family.

As a big proponent of reading and using one's imagination. I enjoyed the concept behind Barney's Book Fair.

Every time I think that my girls have ""out grown"" the big purple dinosaur I am pleasantly surprised to find him and his friends creating a new experience or teaching a new lesson that will intrigue and sustain my daughters' attention.

The book that accompanies the DVD is nicely illustrated and will help your child learn to count.  Barney videos are truly a staple of childhood.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barney-Book-Fair/dp/B0027HOBJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barney: Book Fair</a>",1251331200,3,823,5.833333333333333

1840769,3,B00008DYQ5,"My 2 to 5 year old group of family and friends who absoutely LOVE ""Songs Fron The Park"" invariably get bored with this DVD and walk away from it.  A few of the songs excite them somewhat but over all this is a take it or leave it video . . . more or less taken because that's whats in the machine. Give them a choice and they choose something else every time.

Wouldn't waste my money if I was you.

1840770,2,B00008DYQ5,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter (20 months).  She wouldn't even watch it the first few times I played it.  We put it away for a couple months and now she will watch parts of it, but prefers other videos more.  I can't comment on the voice issue as I don't watch enough Barney to really pay attention, and since we are recent Barney converts having a new cast doesn't bother me.  The song are not very engaging though, there is a lot of talking, and really no songs that my daughter would recognize.
How I rated
*Educational value: the DVD does encourage reading and activity.
 Entertaining to children: my daughter doesn't really like this video all that much
 Entertaining to adults: I can't stand to sit through it
*cost: on par with most videos
 general: nothing else really good to say about this, and in fact took a star away because of the annoying ads in the front.  YOu have to fast forward through them and you can't simply skip to the menu.  I hate this.",1061251200,4,969,4.398876404494382
1840771,2,B00008DYQ5,"I was very disappointed to find that this is a 2003 DVD,  not an old one.  Why does it have the year as 1992?  The new Barney and Baby Bop voices are very annoying.  I was looking for a particular video with last year's kids...  this is NOT it.. Only Baby Bop is on the cover,  so there's no way to know..
My 2 and 3 year old boys did not sit to watch this for more than 2 or 3 minutes,  I can't explain why.  We did sit down to get relaxed towards the end and discovered that this does not end with Barney's Famous ""I love you"" song...  It ended rather apruptly.  This might sound silly - but the kids get to knowing when the video is coming to an end... and bedtime is near... :-)
I am also disappointed in the new Barney videos which run like a VHS tape,  you cannot jump to favorite songs, you have to fast forward and rewind.  This does not work well at bedtime when we need to get closer to the end... they can see what's being fast forwarded past...not good.
VERY DISAPPOINTED!  I want the old Barney and the old kids back!",1059696000,6,1030,4.014778325123153
1840772,1,B00008DYQ5,"I guess we have been away from the states TOO long. Barney's voice got more annoying then before. I bought this tape for my 15 month old. She really loved the More Barney Songs video. I bought this one to add to her collection, we all sat down to watch it - when Barney started to talk, he sounded like Elmer Fudd!! Anyhow, 5 minutes into the video, my daughter got up and went to her room and played with her toys. Our house will be sticking to the CLASSIC BARNEY tapes when he was lovably annoying, not NAUSEATING annoying....",1055030400,4,528,4.29

1840814,5,B00008DYQ5,"My daughter loves Barney and can play the same DVD over and over again.  I buy her new ones from time to time so she has some variety.  My daughter goes around signing ""books are fun, books are great, lets sit down and read a book today"" from the DVD.  It has helped her to appreciate books.  That makes it well worth the small cost.",1376524800,,333,4.076923076923077

7982068,5,B00008DYQ5,"Anything Barney (besides dvds) is hard to find now, so I was so happy when this dvd came with a book too! Our 18 month old daughter loves Barney and she loves books, so she was absolutely thrilled to have the barney book! This episode is a great episode and after she's watched it several times, she is not bored with it at all. She enjoys waking up with Barney in the morning, and we love it because it keeps her occupied while breakfast being is prepared, and she gets up to dance to the songs, which gets her moving! Barney is a morning staple in our house and we love it! Great episode, great songs and cast!",1480118400,,612,4.194915254237288
