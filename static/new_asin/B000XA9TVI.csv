Of my opinion, I can confess that I dearly love the States National Guards, all of them, having been the daughter of a ""First Shirt"", in the FL. National Guard,FLD, FL.  Long time ago. Not that anyone cares....Because I am also a Veteran, decades older than dirt, I have to give the guys here a hand, they went there and did what they were told to do. Boo-Hoo.  It's soooo awful!!!
Change places with any ground pounders, anytime and place, they don't have time for ice cream and shopping....too busy goi'n hot,  who maybe need a medevac.  Listen, I do love the Guard, but what I think is pathetic, is these were personnel who merely plugged the numbers then, to  justify the numbers, later, as history has already informed us.  That certain mega corps profited, yeah?  It's still happening.  These guys were badly misused.  I may love 'em, but c'mon....they had ice cream!
So for this film, at this time, I am penning a solid 3.2....but with some better editing, it may advance to .5.
One thing I noticed in this film is the early onset of routine, a very bad thing to have in the front row;  never turn your back on routine. Recall, the turret gunner sipping his morning brew from his thermos mug, and adjusting his shades.  You folks went, survived it,  Good.  Remember your MOS, and even though someone says ""No, You have to do this..."", now, recall that at one time you said ""Yes"".  ""I'll go"", -my take with the guard is that no one joins it to go someplace and fight (or box up paper), You do it. I'm sorry, I do not mean to be non-supportive, but it seemed they were whiny. It had to be the flies.
I'm glad I saw this film, but I would advise anyone who watches to consider it somewhat self-congratulatory.  Judge it from there.  Already, it's more than a decade old.  Stuff now is very different.  I would, no matter what, always support those who defend us, plus it gave me, during my service (20)- the direction for my life and career.  However, one last thought- THANKS. Your unit's having been where and when it was,  was relative in that more of America may finally get the idea that this war, as things would have it, just sucked. All wars do. I want to focus on the discussions, lastly. In the film, both were right, in terms of making good debate. What we mostly know now, though, is that it's beginning to seem it doesn't matter which side you take.  One way or another, we still keep being called to help.  Our country.  Which is why guys like this have to leave their families and jobs, we still keep saying, ""Yes.  We'll help.""  When do we get to reply, ""Nah, we're booked today, handle it yourselves, "".  Maybe I'd enjoy that.  In the end, even though these guys didn't get to see guts and glory ""WAR"", I'm grateful that they didn't.  I hope they feel the same. ""  ""Thanks, rant off!""",1431993600,4,2878,4.377358490566038
8227594,3,B000XA9TVI,"I saw the original showing in Orlando at the film festival, & it seems a few things were edited out.  Most likely because of the extreme political controversy of this film.  I do agree with Jeremy & these soldiers though;... the 2003 Iraq attack was a scam for profit, as was the 911 attacks, all orchestrated by the Bush administration.  Go ahead & laugh, but it's not the first time something like this has happened.  Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the corporate war machine taking over, & instigating wars for profit.  JKF understood, & tried to stand up to them, but when LBJ took over, the first order of his agenda was to start a war, & that's exactly what he did.",1425254400,3,670,4.459016393442623
8227595,4,B000XA9TVI,"A good doc about reservists going to Iraq.  Watching this made me angry about all the money that the government wastes.  A Halliburton employee that sells popcorn (and that's ALL he does!) makes $82,000 a year!  There's row and rows of sub's that sit unused in the sun paid for by US taxpayers.  Prepared to be appalled...",1424476800,5,322,4.5964912280701755
8227596,5,B000XA9TVI,"This documentary is not what I had expected, and in many ways, as I look back at the differences between my expectations and reality, it is much better than it should have been.

I rented it thinking that it's another of the interesting, fascinating, inspiring reports that have been coming from journalists imbedded with our troops since the beginning of the post-9/11 wars.  Instead it is much more.  The filmmaker is/was a National Guardsman who had joined up and then entered college to study film.  Luckily for us, when he was called up and deployed, he took his camera with him.

The production is basically as expected - 2004 video looks different than 2015 video, and there are minor glitches in the storytelling, editing, etc.  I might have chosen different music in one section.  All of the drawbacks, though, are pushed far into the background in favor of the highlights of this documentary - the interviews with its stars.  At its heart ""Land of Confusion"" is the story of a year in the life of a group of men from Pennsylvania.  Their disappointments, acts of heroism, endurance, persistence, patriotism, friendship, disagreements, and towering victories are on display here along with many other reasons for every American to give thanks that they were willing and able to serve.  War is made up of individual human beings, too many of whom lose their lives for reasons that do not seem to make sense.  Zerechak has given us at least two examples with his work.

RIP, and thanks for your service, Sgt. Baker, and thank you to the friends and fellow soldiers with whom he served.",1421884800,8,1592,4.791208791208791
