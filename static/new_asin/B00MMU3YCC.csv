Posted on December 1, 2016
Stefan Herheims 2012 production of Dvoks Rusalka for Brussels La Monnaie Theatre is predictably ambitious and complex.  He takes an explicitly Freudian (by way of Lacan) view of the piece(*).  The female characters are representations of male views of the female and, sometimes it seems, vice versa.  Its seen most clearly in Act 2 and I found unpacking Act 1 much easier after seeing it so Im going to start there.  We open not with bucolic, if coarse, peasants preparing for a wedding feast.  We are on a street in a scruffy part of, I guess, Brussels.  The gamekeeper and kitchen boy are replaced by a priest and a policeman.  The traditional dismembered game animals become a female chorus, many of them nuns, with exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics.  There is, essentially, an orgy.  Clearly the human world that Rusalka cannot enter is about sex in its most physical aspects not meaty Central European banquet platters!  Rusalka and the Foreign Princess are dressed and wigged identically.  They are quite freely interchanged.  Lines that are canonically addressed to one are addressed to the other and so forth.  Its pretty clear that each represents, albeit imperfectly, the Princes ideal woman.  Rusalka is the unattainable feminine ideal; flawed in that she cannot engage in fully satisfying sexual activity.  The foreign Princess is sexually satisfying but falls short precisely by not being unattainable.  Some less clear male duality is suggested by the appearance of the Vodnik dressed as the Prince.  It just gets weirder from there with the ballet of nuns, prostitutes, fish, squid and heaven knows what else spilling over into the auditorium while the Prince and Foreign Princess watch from a box and Rusalka and the Vodnik get caught up in the action.  At the conclusion of the act its Rusalka not the Princess that he begs for help.

And so to back track to Act 1.  We are in the hyper realistic street.  There is a scruffy bar, a sex shop, the entrance to a Metro station, a church and a block of walk up apartments.  This is the decidedly scruffy end of town.  It is raining.  The water sprites appear to be bar girls.  When they interact with their customers the set goes all kinetic including bouncing blow up dolls in the sex shop window. Jeibaba is a bag lady living in the entrance to the Metro.  The Vodnik appears to be a respectable bourgeois but hes mobbed by the bar girls, to the disgust of his wife watching from their balcony (she will later show up as the Foreign Princess).  The chorus is nightmarish.  Rusalka appears in a silver suit and heels which she gives to Jeibaba as the price of the spell.  Various watery things happen on or in a sort of pillar of water that appears from the pavement.  The Prince when he finally appears, heralded by a stoner Huntsman, is a sailor; apparently of somewhat higher rank than the ones cavorting with the bar girls.  The Vodnik throws an exploding TV set into the street (A Berenices potato in my book).  The scene dissolves into a nightmarish orgy of brides, sex dolls and bar girls.  Clearly the subconscious is a chaotic and dangerous place.

The denouement of Rusalka is always hard to pull off because even the canonically story relies far too much on coincidence and implausible super-natural interventions.  Herheim deals by continuing his treatment of the principal male and female characters as aspects of the same archetypal person.  So we open with Rusalka singing to the Vodnik not the Prince.  Rusalka and Jeibaba are now identically dressed in off the shoulder dresses of silvery scales and they taunt the Vodnik.  Theres a lot of stabbing but no blood until Rusalka appears from the apartment dressed in the white night dress of Act 2 but covered in blood. She gives the knife to the Vodnik who goes into the apartment and stabs his wife (the Foreign Princess).The chorus reappear as nightmarish nuns and mob Rusalka.  She is returned to the watery pillar. The water sprites appear dressed like Rusalka and the Princess.  The Vodnik goes after them with an axe.  The scene dissolves into a much more watery world in which sprites swim and there is a lot of weed.  The Prince appears and he and Rusalka sing out their scene of explanation/expiation/reconciliation???  At the conclusion they embrace and are apparently consumed in some sort of aquatic Aurora Borealis and we are back on the street.  Its a crime scene now.  The Vodnik is being led away in handcuffs and the body of his wife recovered.  Rusalka appears back in her silver suit and sings to the dead woman and then shes back to tempting mortals.  Nothing has happened.  Nothing has changed.  Probably!

If you have read this far you probably aren't the type of person who would casually dismiss such a production.  Its difficult but thought provoking.  Visually spectacular at times.  Baffling at times.  But, I think, worth the effort.

The performances are interesting too.  I don't think this is the best sung Rusalka on disk, especially in the title role.  If you are looking for the ultimate in creamy tone and floaty high notes in the big numbers it would have to be said that Rene Fleming, caught in her prime in Paris in 2002, is clearly superior but Myrt Papatanasu is very good and her acting is superb.  Willard White is super solid in both departments as the Vodnik and Rene Morloc is a convincing Jeibaba.  I found Pavel Cernoch a bit anonymous as the Prince but that may be the production as much as anything.  Annalena Perssons Foreign Princess is also solid across the board.  More than adequate performances in the smaller roles add up to a good ensemble performance.  dm Fischer shows good pacing and a feel for the lyricism of the music.  The chorus are terrific, especially the ladies who have a lot to do.  Overall one gets the impression that, for better or worse, the whole gang bought into Herheims concept and worked effectively together to pull it off.

Willy Vanduren directed the film and I think captures it fairly.  Thats no mean feat.  There is a lot going on.  On Blu-ray, the DTS-HD sound and HD picture are top notch.  There are ten minutes or so of interviews included as a bonus.  Its worth watching them before seeing the show.  The booklet includes a couple of essays, a synopsis and a track listing.  Curiously both synopsis and track listing are entirely canonical and so not terribly helpful in following this production!  Subtitle options are English, German, French, Dutch and Korean.

Its hard to know where to position this release in relation to the rest of the catalogue.  Its obviously not for the traditionally inclined but then neither is Martin Kuejs production at BSO.  Carsens elegant take is very good indeed and its technically very good for a 2002 recording, if not quite up to the highest modern standards.  No doubt Mary Zimmermanns up coming Met production will make it to disk eventually and thats pretty much sure to be a safe bet for those wanting a conventional fairy tale.

8673094,1,B00MMU3YCC,"Russalka has had very bad luck with opera companies. A few years ago I wrote that Russalka had been murdered by the Ren&eacute;e
Flemming recording. But wait until you see this new monstrosity. Russalka is a prostitute! Why do modern opera producers have to impose on us their ideas about a work in which a composer already said all he had to say about a story. This is a world of fantasy
and nobody has the right to change the composers intentions. Singers must also be condemned for participating in such thrash.
I turned my TV set off as soon as Russalka finishes the Song to the Moon an since the audio is so good and the singers adequate I may finish the DVD. I recommend those  who buy this DVD to be careful. A myocardial infraction is a possibility if you finish viewing the video.",1413504000,6,789,4.404109589041096
8673095,4,B00MMU3YCC,"I first saw Rusalka when the Met presented it as part of their Live in HD series and I fell in love with this opera and couldn't wait to get on Amazon and order another production to watch. For an opera that's said to be performed infrequently, there sure are a lot of interpretations to choose from for your home video library -- and none of them take a traditional route unless you count the Czech ""movie"" version, which I've gathered is pretty atrocious.
I'm not a purist, but I'd really been hoping for a traditional version to add to my video library, if not the Met's HD presentation.  When I saw that this production was coming out, I got excited when I saw the cover art. It looked like a traditional telling with perhaps a bit of a Star Wars twist. And I enjoyed the Valencia Ring, so I figured this would be the Rusalka to add to my library. I was so wrong about what I thought it was going to be. It wasn't even set by a futuristic lake.
Now, ""traditional telling vs reimagining"" is a conversation we've all had before and I doubt anyone reading this hasn't already decided how he or she feels on the subject.  So I'm not going there or rating this with any of that in mind. I'm choosing to review the production I saw, not the production I hoped to see.  If you want a traditional telling, by now you've concluded that this one isn't for you and I'll be waiting for the Schenk/Fleming production with you.
Here's what you probably want to know: In this production of Rusalka, the title character is a prostitue, Vodnik is an obsessed old man, and Jezibaba is (I think?) a drug dealer.  The setting is a downtown street in a European city.  The crowd scenes often reminded me of that scene in Sweet Charity when she goes to the mod club with the Italian actor. Or one of Stewie from Family Guy's sexy parties. So that's what we're looking at as far as the director's concept.  It works for the most part, but sometimes it was a bit much (like the water sprites reimagined as 60s sorority girls from hell at the beginning).
The cast all turned in great performances.  Rusalka delivers a Song to the Moon that rivals Lucia Popp's. She's got her heart in playing this role too -- never boring. The Prince is handsome and has a voice that's sometimes lyrical and sometimes just sturdy. No complaints though. Vodnik has a beautiful, rich voice, but he wasn't very interesting to watch. Jezibaba offers a pretty forgettable performance as well, which is really regrettable knowing the impression a good mezzo can make with that part.
I'll probably watch this one again though, mostly to iron out all the ""Hold on, wait -- what??"" moments I just had during this first viewing.",1412812800,5,2680,4.468302658486707
8673096,5,B00MMU3YCC,"Casting her as a prostitute, Stefan Herheim's version of Dvok's fairy-tale Rusalka takes the familiar modern revisionist view of the nymph as an abused woman at the hands of men. As ever with Herheim however, that's only a small part of a much more ambitious concept. By altering the perspective of the work to that of the Water Goblin, this is a vastly more complex and reconstructive view of the story's central theme of the corruption of innocence.

Here, on a street corner, on a remarkably lifelike stage set that could be a street on any middle or eastern European city (albeit with an English 'bobby' on the beat), the streetwalking Rusalka is all glitter and glamour in the eyes of the old man, Vodnk, who wants to possess her and keep her for his own pleasure - a femme fatale who, in the end, will drive him to commit a violent crime of passion. This Rusalka however is no innocent -she's street-smart and wise to the dangers that her lifestyle and clients like the old man represent, but she has a dream of a better life out of the dark world she lives in.  Is she really cut out for the refinement of the world outside, or more to the point, is the world outside ready to accept her?

There's quite a leap involved in making Rusalka a prostitute, and it involves a significant altering of the traditional perspective. Following the music as much as the libretto however, Herheim recognises that the theme for the Water Goblin is indeed present as a leitmotif throughout, and it gives the director justification to consider how women are looked upon and objectified by men. Kept silent by a curse, Rusalka is prevented from expressing who she wants to be herself. Consequently, this production doesn't present the most flattering or politically correct view of women. They are all witches, prostitutes and nuns, many of them with exaggerated female figures in quite obscene body suits, the nuns even taking part in an orgy, and there is a great deal of violence enacted against them in brutal stabbings. This altered perspective however is used by the director precisely to show an idealisation that the reality doesn't live up to.

You have to work hard however to get to this realisation as there is a bewildering array of imagery on the stage and considerable twists to characterisation that would be difficult to disentangle even for someone very familiar with the work. This includes a wife for the Vodnk, who is not in the original libretto, in a non-singing role, although she is played by the same singer (Annalena Persson) who is the Foreign Princess. While this and some other doubling of roles may initially be confusing, it reflects the director's view (much like his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Bohme/dp/B008H2IIMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Bohme</a>) of mirroring reality with the fantasy ""fairytale"" view of world that is fabricated in the mind of the old man/water goblin. At the very least however, the sheer effort of trying to fit it all together commands attention and forces the audience to reconsider what the work is actually about. Unless you think Rusalka is just a lyric fairytale and is perfectly fine in that form without all the psychological probing.

Also commanding is the spectacle on the stage itself, which really is quite extraordinary. The street scene, designed by Heike Scheele, is remarkably realistic but, in keeping with the fantasy/reality theme, elements explode out and upward, as if you were looking at a children's pop-up book. There's so much going on however that it can be difficult to make sense of it all, but the immensely powerful coup de theatre of the conclusion should at least bring the full impact and realisation of the meaning of the work in Herheim's vision of its present day application as well as its relevance to Dvok's original work.

With performances as good as that of the principals cast here moreover, you'll happily put up with some shock and befuddlement. As Rusalka and the Prince, Myrt Papatanasiu and Pavel Cernoch are just magnificent, Papatanasiu in her singing and acting performance managing to bring across the vulnerability of her character as well as the inner strength of personality that seeks to express herself within this world dominated by the desires of men. The Prince can be somewhat of a cipher, so it's wonderful to see the role sung with such lyricism and with some consideration of the duality of his nature. Willard White as the Water Goblin isn't quite up to their level, but he is a strong presence nonetheless. dm Fischer ensures that the performers are never overpowered by the orchestra, which means musically it can feel a little restrained, but it captures beautifully the late-Romanticism of Dvok's score.",1411430400,2,4776,4.978696741854637
8673097,5,B00MMU3YCC,"I've seen this when it was originally available for online streaming from Brussels.  It is terrific and I am a particular fan of Stefan Herheim.

Although the information indicates otherwise, very few performing arts blu-rays are region coded with limitations.  Most are set for world-wide.  Hopefully Amazon is incorrect with ""B/2.""  The Euroarts website shows this as ""all.""",1410307200,2,376,5.413793103448276
