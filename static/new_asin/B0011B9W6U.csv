3064368,1,B0011B9W6U,"This is not a good movie. The characters weren't introduced well at all, nor was their setting. Who are these people? Why do they have a big empty mansion? What is the boy's particular ailment? What's the mother's illness?

The film begins very slow, and there's a glimmer of hope when the boy goes off his meds and the camera starts moving, rather than just being a succession of motionless shots.

There are a few laughably terrible scenes, and some really disturbing imagery, but there's never a reason to care about the fate of these characters. The plot goes seriously off the rails in the second half - though, in truth, it never really makes sense to begin with. So, atmospheric to begin with, it just gets loony (not in a good way).

It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and after the first twenty minutes I wasn't bored. But it really stinks.",1204934400,,855,4.538961038961039
3064369,2,B0011B9W6U,"This movie wasn't what I'd expected.  The movie begins by holding to it's premise; that of the father leaving on a trip.  He's arranged for a caregiver for his bed-ridden and ill wife, but his mentally challenged son, James, wants to take care of mommy himself.  So dad leaves and James chases away the caregiver and it's just James and Mommy in this huge old mansion in a terrible state of disrepair.

James can't take care of himself, much less his ill mother.  He goes through the routine of getting his medications but forgets to actually take them.  So with James behind the wheel as mom's caretaker, things go downhill pretty fast.  His concept of time is erratic, so he doesn't get mom to the bathroom on time, he thinks extra pills will make her well faster, and forgets where he's left her.  This isn't the entire gist of the movie though.

The hired caretaker brings the police to break into the house.  There's a very bizarre operation scene that takes place in the house (not in a hospital), a lot of freaky-deaky photography showing James scampering all over the house in his fugues, and a very trippy dream scene during one of James's overdoses.  Top this off with flash-forwards and flash-backs, and you have the movie.

The plot was weak, I hate to say.  The photography was dark in too many scenes.  Wardrobe went a little over the top with James, as if he weren't acting freaky enough, they dressed him in high-waters with white socks and an outlandishly wide tie.  The director did manage to capture the mood and surrealism of James's fugues, and the acting was rather decent.

Overall, this isn't a movie I would recommend unless you choose to rent first.  It didn't fill the promise I expected of it, and was on the lower end of the 'B' semi-horror scale.  Rent, don't buy.",1204848000,2,1794,4.588050314465409
3064370,5,B0011B9W6U,"The Living and the Dead is not a roller coaster horror movie meant to take the audience on a thrilling, but in the end, quite harmless ride.  While there is certainly nothing wrong with that type of movie, in the end there are little consequences to the deaths we've seen, little detailed memory of the survivors, and little learned.  It is a digestible experience.

This film does not set out to take the audience on a palatable journey.  Director Simon Rumley, having experienced his own personal loss due to sickness in his own family seems intent on putting the audience through the emotional wear and tear this has on one's heart and mind.  The end result might turn some viewers off, but it is an unforgettable experience.

For fans of Darren Aronofsky and Stanley Kubrick should definitely check this very special film out.  It is the movie equivalent to being pinned down the bottom of the ocean by a great big boulder.  It is brilliant.",1204761600,2,945,4.684848484848485
3064371,4,B0011B9W6U,"Director Simon Rumley must have had a really bad day.  In fact, he must have had a bad week.  Or year.

""The Living and the Dead"" is one of the most melancholy, depressing, morose, life negating, soul destroying films that I have ever seen.  I give it four stars because I'm more than certain that this is precisely what Rumley was aiming for, and art of this sort has a place as well: how much CAN you watch without reaching for the handgun locked away in case the Neocons finally get absolute power?

A morbid and remorseless descent into impoverished and destroyed lives, ""Living"" takes us into the mind and limited reality of  schizophrenic man-child James Brocklebank (played exquisitely by Leo Bill).  Constantly contorting in handicapped agony and yearning for the constant company of his stressed out father and invalid mother, swallows his gigantic medications as a child might swallow candy and fears more than all else being left alone.  A sort of demented youthful British glow makes him lovable although all one wants to do while watching him drool, scream, and shoot himself up with mysterious syringes is to look away.  Making a very serious judgment in error, his father leaves his physically ill mother alone with James to go seek treatment for her mysterious disease.

James decides that he is going to make his parents proud of him by taking care of his mother all by himself in his father's absence--that is, by administering her medications himself, taking her to the bathroom himself (the scene of incontinence and James' incomprehension is simply unparalleled in any foulness I've seen recently, in fantasy or reality).  He also decides that the Nurse his father has appointed for her is not to be let in the house, and becomes enraged when his mother desperately asks for her.  As she slowly rots from his unintentional but decidedly violent mistreatment, he descends into hallucinations involving both mother and father of a hallucinatory, transgender quality.

Well, after stabbing a whole bunch of people he mistakes for his mother, James then stabs himself at his mother's funeral while hallucinating that she is there.

Then his father, who has gone completely insane from these traumatic events, is carted away from the desolate mansion in which all has been lost, with the memory of his son's childish plea: ""You always say you're going to be there, but you always leave the room!""

This will test your mind, heart, and above all: the stomach.",1208736000,4,2474,4.927710843373494
3064372,2,B0011B9W6U,"I had high hopes for this flick after reading about it in a horror magazine.  The premise was interesting but I found the execution overdone.  We can tell from the beginning of the film that the son is mentally disturbed but there are a lot of sound effects, music, and silly camera effects used to further punctuate that idea which I felt were way overdone and it came off more comical than disturbing.  Also, there is some foreshadowing in the film that is very very poorly executing and poorly timed.  Pass on this one folks!",1208649600,,528,4.526315789473684
3064373,4,B0011B9W6U,"This disturbing psychodrama is a far cry from most horror films. Centered on the death of the mother of the family, the plot revolves around Donald Brocklebank,  a father who is seeing his manor fall into poverty, his psychotic son and his terminally ill wife. James, the son, is raging with visions that he can take care of his ailing mother, which takes up the movie's disturbing first third. When Daddy heads to London to find more funds to take care of his wife (or answer to some hinted upon controversy published in the local newspaper - you're never quite sure), James locks out the family nurse so he can be the caretaking ""man of the house."" Thus is his mother sent into a claustrophobic filmed hell. The scenes where James cares for/brutalizes her are maddeningly disturbing.

Then the Police and rescue arrive. Or do they? James loads himself with drugs and falls into deeper, murderous madness. Or does he? Daddy Donald is protective of his son - or is he repulsed? Yes, the movie really is that disjointed, presented in the schizophrenia that James (Leo Bill) must have running through his own mind. But then again, as the film's final act posits, maybe James isn't the one descended into madness.

It's easy to see how ""The Living and The Dead"" would be a hit with film fest types, as it has just the barest hint of narrative from which all sorts of angst and art dangle. Director/Writer Simon Lumley has commented that his movie is a direct reaction to losing his own mother to Cancer, and the infuriating helplessness he felt as the disease progressed. It is a blunt emotional force, confusing and frightening, that he brings to ""The Living and The Dead,"" and not an altogether watchable one. This is not a movie that you'll feel good about after you watch it, and at times it made me feel like I was seeing a close cousin to Roman Polanski's hallucinatory nightmare,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Repulsion/dp/B0007GAG42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Repulsion</a>.

3064374,2,B0011B9W6U,"'The Living and the Dead' tells the story of a husband who has to go away to help pay for his wife's medical bills.  The mother is left alone in the home with their adult mentally challenged son and nurse and the result is a horror movie that is just not good.  If you enjoy bad movies or bad horror movies specifically this might be a good selection for you, but 90% of the movie loving world will not love this piece of work.

3064375,2,B0011B9W6U,"The best part of the movie was Leo Bill's portrayal of James, the mentally ill son. You know right off that something is wrong with him. Also, the strained relationship between him and his father was convincing. I felt the palpable terror of the mother, who was left alone with her son while her husband went on some business errand.

Now for the worst parts of this movie: The music and ""special effects"" as James runs through the house. Throughout the movie, we hear the mournful piano ballad in the background. Then, when James starts reacting to his meds, the viewer is subjected to wild strobe light effects and staccato guitars. Not only was this totally unnecessary, but distracting.

Like the other reviewers, I didn't enjoy the plot, especially the climax and the ending. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't sure how to rate this movie. I've seen and walked out on worse. Although the plot was weak, it did manage to revolt and disturb me. I had virtually no knowledge of how these characters came to be in the place that they were in, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for them, especially the father.

That said, I wouldn't pay good money to see this film unless it was edited for more clarity.",1205971200,,1203,4.586046511627907

3064379,1,B0011B9W6U,"I feel awful giving this movie one star. But in all honesty, I didn't enjoy it and it left me feeling nauseas. It's unfair, though, to not justify my opinions because I'm sure that there are some people who will like this movie. In fact, there may be some who read my review and think that it's the movie for them. It's just simply not the movie for me.

When the movie began, I felt so sorry for the father. His gigantic English mansion is empty of nearly all furniture (insinuating financial ruin), his picture is in the paper again (and not for a good reason), his wife is up a million flights of stairs in what might be her death bed, and his grown son is in a state of deranged mental illness. I could feel the absolute despair of the father seeping through the scenes of the movie. And the setting of an echoing old mansion is the perfect gothic setting for such a story of despair.

The father has to leave on business, and this is where the movie starts to go into a downward spiral for me. You begin to see the world through the eyes of the deranged son as he takes the phone off the hook and locks all the doors so that he can take care of his mother without interference from the nurse. However, he is in no state to take care of anyone. He takes his medication in increasingly larger doses, causing him to seriously flip out. The movie plays in fast motion. The music goes crazy. And in his psychotic frenzy, he neglects his bedridden mother to the point of her completely soiling herself and her bed. On and on this goes: pills, psychotic frenzy, the yelling of ""mummy"", the moaning of his mom and calling for a nurse, etc. The story repeats itself and heads to an end that you know can't be good: pills, needles, knives, needles, blood, pills, screaming, dementia, hallucinations, knives, needles, blood, screaming, dementia. I repeat myself here on purpose. These are not elements that I enjoy seeing en masse in movies.

I liked the concept of the movie: showing how overwhelming it can be to care for one person to care for two ill people and stay sane. Unfortunately, I liked nothing beyond the beginning of the movie. The screen would turn dark, and I kept hoping that it was switching over to the credits instead of turning from night to yet another day in the mansion of the deranged.",1205884800,2,2305,4.406103286384977
3064380,1,B0011B9W6U,"The good points of this movie are good filming, good acting and a beautiful old English manor or mansion.

So how could it go wrong? There simply isn't a coherent story.  If the characters had been properly introduced, viewers might still have had some feeling for them, but it's left unclear who they are and what they're doing in a big empty mansion.

The ""message"" of the film is:  ""Do not attempt to care for psychopaths in your home.""  All kinds of bad things can result.

It's such a shame that with a properly-done story, this could have been a very memorable film.  The camera frequently follows the characters up and down an impressive winding set of stairways leading from one landing to another in a once beautiful old English mansion.  At each turn, viewers expect the end of the story, or at least something dramatic.  Yet it just goes on and on, not remembering if there was ever a theme to this movie.

If you enjoy knives and insanity, then this could be a movie you'd enjoy, but otherwise you would probably prefer that it had ended sooner.  Ladies and Gentlemen--writers and filmmakers:  please make sure your movie has a story to tell!",1205798400,,1154,4.602941176470588
3064381,1,B0011B9W6U,"If I have to summarize the movie in a couple of words, Deranged Experience would be it. The movie is set in an old English mansion and revolves around a family with two too many sick people.
The mother is bedridden, the son is schizophrenic and the father appears to lose touch with reality from time to time. At one point the viewers are drawn into this psychotic drama, as the movie wavers between the point of view of the son and the father.

Ultimately and as in many movies that attempt to examine madness, the viewer is left confused and dissatisfied. There is no lesson one can learn from this drama, except that one should stay away from movies made by little known producers, directors and actors.

Very dissatisfied and would not recommend it. Instead, watch 'The Jacket', 'The Tenant', or 'Donnie Darko'.",1205798400,2,815,4.652777777777778
3064382,2,B0011B9W6U,"I gave it two stars for attempting a different kind of movie and on that score it succeeded.  Unfortunately, the end result is a sad mash of weird and boring.  As already noted, this film is about a man needing to tend to business while leaving behind an invalid wife and mentally ill son in a decrepit mansion.  He arranges for a nurse to look after them both.  Before he leaves, the father catches the son not taking his nightly injections (of what I'd like to know) and a very intriguing conversation follows.

""Sometimes I like to pretend I'm normal""
""But you're not normal""
""But I could be if you let me""

So sets the stage for the son keeping the nurse away and attempting to take care of his mother and himself to make his father proud.  Of course he chooses not to take his medication and things go horribly awry.  For example, he figures if he gives his mother more medication she'll get better faster.  Weirdness ensues and it all ends rather badly.

I really liked the physicality of the son.  He moves in a unique way as befitting his mental state.  The super fast motion of the son off his medication with everything as a blur and characters in a normal state moving slowly and monotonously through life was interesting but not enough.  I liked how the mansion was a main character as well and reflected its inhabitants.  The movie starts with an old bedraggled man in a precarious mental state roaming through a deteriorating mansion and then we go backwards to see how the character reached that state.  Okay.  But why would a health system great enough to perform an operation on sight at the mansion allow such conditions to exist?  Wouldn't the nurse have come much quicker to their aid knowing the exact state of affairs rather then allow it to continue for days until calling the police for help? The plot moved unnaturally, just to make things fit.  The son takes handfuls of pills each morning and injections at night.  For what?!?  It is never explained but we know he's been this way for a while.  What exactly is wrong with the wife/mother?  She has recently become an invalid since the photo of the happy smiling family looks recent.  She can stand but not walk?  What has happened to drastically change the happy family in the photo to what they have become now.  Bankruptcy?  Nothing is explained and what unfolds is a mess of weirdness, hallucinations and boring shots of everyday life that drag on.

There were no commentaries on this dvd which might have changed my view.  Also, there were no subtitles which would have helped me to understand some of the dialogue better.",1205798400,3,2603,4.587852494577007

Boring is putting it mildly but given I committed to review this movie for Vine, I refused to give up on it and watched it in it's entirety. My guess would be that whomever made this movie must have been on a serious drug trip when they made this because this movie is so out there and only someone who was heavily medicated could find any redeeming qualities in this flick. Boring, ridiculous, annoying and complete torture are words I'd use to describe the Living and the Dead. Let's put it this way, I had enough time this evening to either watch this movie and review it or clean out my son's guinea pigs cage, I wish I chose the latter.",1205712000,,782,4.185430463576159

Mum is operated on and the equipment is promptly removed.)  I gave it one star but WE (hubby and I)should get five stars for sitting through the whole thing.

3064385,2,B0011B9W6U,"I don't rightly know what to think or say about this little weird film.  Reading the synopsis was enough to give me a reason to try it.  Basically, a family, facing bankruptcy, is falling apart.  The father of the family has to leave his sick wife in the care of a nurse and his troubled man-child of a son.

The son, obviously mentally troubled, wants his parents to be proud of him and ends up cutting him and his mother off from the outside world, shutting out the nurse and trying to take care of his mom by himself.  From here, the story spirals down towards tragedy since the son obviously cannot care for his mother.

Okay.  So from the very beginning of the film, I didn't really buy into the whole plot of the film.  The acting was very off-putting originally, with the actor who plays James, the troubled son, alternating between decent and horrible in his portrayal.

As the story continued, the way the film was shot really kept me from being pulled into what was happening.  There are times when James will run from place to place and the camera work speeds up, to show his state of mind, I'm sure, and really odd music plays.  It's at moments like these where I start to look at the clock wondering...how much longer?

Even though it's been kind of billed as a horror film, it's not.  Sure, the events that occur are disturbing and it's definitely a bizzare little flick.  But, on the whole, I would categorize it more as a tragic drama than a horror film.

I didn't really give you much to go on...but I just...simply don't know what to say.  I didn't care for the film (obviously) and, well, I guess that's that.",1205539200,,1628,4.412751677852349

This one really get's you thinking and tried to get you into the head of a schizophrenic man (I believe that would be the main character's diagnosis), and does so convincingly. If you are interested in the potential impact of serious mental illness on families, five the Living and the Dead a watch.",1205280000,4,604,4.5

3064388,3,B0011B9W6U,"This film follows a mentally handicapped young man who is living with his father and invalid mother.  The film sets up early on that James has a severe mental illness that renders him unable to care for himself.  His mother Nancy is confined to her bed, while father Donald has his hands full caring for both.  But when Donald is called away on business, James gets angry that he isn't left in charge.  He wants to prove to his parents that he is the man of the house - so he locks the hired nurse out of the house and begins to try and take care of his mother.  Things quickly spiral out of control as James stops taking his medicine and ""forces"" his care onto his distraught mother.

The setup for the film is quite nice.  Rumley creates a soft-spot for the audience in James and his father.  Early scenes show James freaking out and his father lovingly taking care of him.  Later, as James begins to put his mother's life in danger, we do not feel so much angry with James, but rather we feel sorry for him.  This film is less about the danger faced by Nancy, and more about the sadness of James' strong desire yet incapicity to care for his mom.

Unfortunately, the main story ""ends"" about midway through the film, and the final act begins to fall apart.  James' psychosis begins to go into overdrive, and he has one of the strangest hallucinations I've seen in film.  Later, his father goes similarly nuts, and it begins to become difficult to follow the storyline.  By the end, it was difficult to tell who had done what to whom, and how much of what we saw really took place, and when.  This muddled final act undoes all the good the first half had set up.

Performances are good across the board, with Leo Bill having the most difficult job of the three bringing James' psychosis to life.  The character he creates is nearly laughable in the early portions of the film (think an amalgamation of the characters Rick and Vyvyan from the UK TV series, THE YOUNG ONES).  As the film progresses, the odd mannerisms become equally frightening and heartbreaking.

If Rumley had stretched out the middle portion of the film a bit longer, and had a more comprehensible ending, I might have recommended the film - as it is, it is largely a disappointment.  I give it three stars for good acting and an interesting opening portion.

Take Note: while there is only a sparse amount of gore and no sex or language, the film has some disturbing thematic moments between the mother and son as he tries to care for her.",1205107200,,2510,4.4485776805251644

This flick is full of awkward cuts and grating noise. The psychotic mentally incompetent son destroys his family, although the dad plays a huge role in this process by not being there for the dying mother. The movie rambles on through predictable scenes that closely match what might really happen if you put a mentally ill dullard in charge of a dying patient's care. Except for the random descents into violence, which are strange and pointless, just like most real violence.

I didn't really get the point of The Living and the Dead. Might be a good flick to watch if you're really a narcissist at heart.",1205107200,2,848,4.42948717948718
3064390,3,B0011B9W6U,"A preference of director Simon Rumley for this film's title before its release was THE LIVING IN THE HOME OF THE DEAD since the work that he formulated is based round his potent emotional reactions to the death of his mother from cancer, an exhausting event for Rumley as well as for the disease's victim.  The film will be at least in part artistically inaccessible to those viewers who will be uncomfortable watching a rather nauseous compendium of scenes filled with the actions of an obvious madman, in addition to unbridled drug usage, gore, feces, and vomitus.  For the most part, Rumley employs a brilliantly expressionistic method in order to reflect his repugnance at recollecting the dismal three month decline into death of his mother, with his intent here obviously being communication to viewers of his ruinous sense of incertitude and bewilderment, quite conventional states for one observing another person gradually perish.  Because there is no particular linear aspect to the narrative, the tone of the film steadily becomes surreal, with incongruous and often ostensibly senseless scenes born from a nightmarishly burdened subconscious, and while handling of this type of episode seems at times laboured and in poor taste, a viewer should be aware of the internal flaying that became a primary determinant for the piece.  Shot in only eighteen days within the voluminous Cardigan Savernake House in Wiltshire, England, using eight of the derelict structure's 250 rooms, the picture is efficiently crafted by director, cast and crew, and offers a bravura turn from Leo Bill playing as addled son of a dying woman.  The film was in reality constructed during post-production editing, and there will be precious little for a majority of viewers to like, since the affair plainly is too repellent for most audiences.  None the less, one looks forward to whatever the talented Rumley will provide next, now that this purgative production has been completed.",1205020800,,1970,5.179245283018868

Top this off with flash-forwards and flash-backs, and you have the movie.

The plot was weak, I hate to say.  The photography was dark in too many scenes.  Wardrobe went a little over the top with James, as if he weren't acting freaky enough, they dressed him in high-waters with white socks and an outlandishly wide tie.  The director did manage to capture the mood and surrealism of James's fugues, and the acting was rather decent.

Overall, this isn't a movie I would recommend unless you choose to rent first.  It didn't fill the promise I expected of it, and was on the lower end of the 'B' semi-horror scale.  Rent, don't buy.",1204848000,2,1794,4.588050314465409

While there is certainly nothing wrong with that type of movie, in the end there are little consequences to the deaths we've seen, little detailed memory of the survivors, and little learned.  It is a digestible experience.

This film does not set out to take the audience on a palatable journey.  Director Simon Rumley, having experienced his own personal loss due to sickness in his own family seems intent on putting the audience through the emotional wear and tear this has on one's heart and mind.  The end result might turn some viewers off, but it is an unforgettable experience.

For fans of Darren Aronofsky and Stanley Kubrick should definitely check this very special film out.  It is the movie equivalent to being pinned down the bottom of the ocean by a great big boulder.  It is brilliant.",1204761600,2,945,4.684848484848485
3298868,4,B0011B9W6U,"Director Simon Rumley must have had a really bad day.  In fact, he must have had a bad week.  Or year.

""The Living and the Dead"" is one of the most melancholy, depressing, morose, life negating, soul destroying films that I have ever seen.  I give it four stars because I'm more than certain that this is precisely what Rumley was aiming for, and art of this sort has a place as well: how much CAN you watch without reaching for the handgun locked away in case the Neocons finally get absolute power?

A morbid and remorseless descent into impoverished and destroyed lives, ""Living"" takes us into the mind and limited reality of  schizophrenic man-child James Brocklebank (played exquisitely by Leo Bill).  Constantly contorting in handicapped agony and yearning for the constant company of his stressed out father and invalid mother, swallows his gigantic medications as a child might swallow candy and fears more than all else being left alone.  A sort of demented youthful British glow makes him lovable although all one wants to do while watching him drool, scream, and shoot himself up with mysterious syringes is to look away.  Making a very serious judgment in error, his father leaves his physically ill mother alone with James to go seek treatment for her mysterious disease.

James decides that he is going to make his parents proud of him by taking care of his mother all by himself in his father's absence--that is, by administering her medications himself, taking her to the bathroom himself (the scene of incontinence and James' incomprehension is simply unparalleled in any foulness I've seen recently, in fantasy or reality).  He also decides that the Nurse his father has appointed for her is not to be let in the house, and becomes enraged when his mother desperately asks for her.  As she slowly rots from his unintentional but decidedly violent mistreatment, he descends into hallucinations involving both mother and father of a hallucinatory, transgender quality.

Well, after stabbing a whole bunch of people he mistakes for his mother, James then stabs himself at his mother's funeral while hallucinating that she is there.

Then his father, who has gone completely insane from these traumatic events, is carted away from the desolate mansion in which all has been lost, with the memory of his son's childish plea: ""You always say you're going to be there, but you always leave the room!""

This will test your mind, heart, and above all: the stomach.",1208736000,4,2474,4.927710843373494

3298870,4,B0011B9W6U,"This disturbing psychodrama is a far cry from most horror films. Centered on the death of the mother of the family, the plot revolves around Donald Brocklebank,  a father who is seeing his manor fall into poverty, his psychotic son and his terminally ill wife. James, the son, is raging with visions that he can take care of his ailing mother, which takes up the movie's disturbing first third. When Daddy heads to London to find more funds to take care of his wife (or answer to some hinted upon controversy published in the local newspaper - you're never quite sure), James locks out the family nurse so he can be the caretaking ""man of the house."" Thus is his mother sent into a claustrophobic filmed hell. The scenes where James cares for/brutalizes her are maddeningly disturbing.

Then the Police and rescue arrive. Or do they? James loads himself with drugs and falls into deeper, murderous madness. Or does he? Daddy Donald is protective of his son - or is he repulsed? Yes, the movie really is that disjointed, presented in the schizophrenia that James (Leo Bill) must have running through his own mind. But then again, as the film's final act posits, maybe James isn't the one descended into madness.

It's easy to see how ""The Living and The Dead"" would be a hit with film fest types, as it has just the barest hint of narrative from which all sorts of angst and art dangle. Director/Writer Simon Lumley has commented that his movie is a direct reaction to losing his own mother to Cancer, and the infuriating helplessness he felt as the disease progressed. It is a blunt emotional force, confusing and frightening, that he brings to ""The Living and The Dead,"" and not an altogether watchable one.

Also, the strained relationship between him and his father was convincing. I felt the palpable terror of the mother, who was left alone with her son while her husband went on some business errand.

Now for the worst parts of this movie: The music and ""special effects"" as James runs through the house. Throughout the movie, we hear the mournful piano ballad in the background. Then, when James starts reacting to his meds, the viewer is subjected to wild strobe light effects and staccato guitars. Not only was this totally unnecessary, but distracting.

It's unfair, though, to not justify my opinions because I'm sure that there are some people who will like this movie. In fact, there may be some who read my review and think that it's the movie for them. It's just simply not the movie for me.

When the movie began, I felt so sorry for the father. His gigantic English mansion is empty of nearly all furniture (insinuating financial ruin), his picture is in the paper again (and not for a good reason), his wife is up a million flights of stairs in what might be her death bed, and his grown son is in a state of deranged mental illness. I could feel the absolute despair of the father seeping through the scenes of the movie. And the setting of an echoing old mansion is the perfect gothic setting for such a story of despair.

The father has to leave on business, and this is where the movie starts to go into a downward spiral for me. You begin to see the world through the eyes of the deranged son as he takes the phone off the hook and locks all the doors so that he can take care of his mother without interference from the nurse. However, he is in no state to take care of anyone. He takes his medication in increasingly larger doses, causing him to seriously flip out. The movie plays in fast motion. The music goes crazy. And in his psychotic frenzy, he neglects his bedridden mother to the point of her completely soiling herself and her bed. On and on this goes: pills, psychotic frenzy, the yelling of ""mummy"", the moaning of his mom and calling for a nurse, etc. The story repeats itself and heads to an end that you know can't be good: pills, needles, knives, needles, blood, pills, screaming, dementia, hallucinations, knives, needles, blood, screaming, dementia. I repeat myself here on purpose. These are not elements that I enjoy seeing en masse in movies.

I liked the concept of the movie: showing how overwhelming it can be to care for one person to care for two ill people and stay sane. Unfortunately, I liked nothing beyond the beginning of the movie. The screen would turn dark, and I kept hoping that it was switching over to the credits instead of turning from night to yet another day in the mansion of the deranged.",1205884800,2,2305,4.406103286384977

So how could it go wrong? There simply isn't a coherent story.  If the characters had been properly introduced, viewers might still have had some feeling for them, but it's left unclear who they are and what they're doing in a big empty mansion.

The ""message"" of the film is:  ""Do not attempt to care for psychopaths in your home.""  All kinds of bad things can result.

It's such a shame that with a properly-done story, this could have been a very memorable film.  The camera frequently follows the characters up and down an impressive winding set of stairways leading from one landing to another in a once beautiful old English mansion.  At each turn, viewers expect the end of the story, or at least something dramatic.  Yet it just goes on and on, not remembering if there was ever a theme to this movie.

3298878,1,B0011B9W6U,"If I have to summarize the movie in a couple of words, Deranged Experience would be it. The movie is set in an old English mansion and revolves around a family with two too many sick people.
The mother is bedridden, the son is schizophrenic and the father appears to lose touch with reality from time to time. At one point the viewers are drawn into this psychotic drama, as the movie wavers between the point of view of the son and the father.

Ultimately and as in many movies that attempt to examine madness, the viewer is left confused and dissatisfied. There is no lesson one can learn from this drama, except that one should stay away from movies made by little known producers, directors and actors.

Very dissatisfied and would not recommend it. Instead, watch 'The Jacket', 'The Tenant', or 'Donnie Darko'.",1205798400,2,815,4.652777777777778
3298879,2,B0011B9W6U,"I gave it two stars for attempting a different kind of movie and on that score it succeeded.  Unfortunately, the end result is a sad mash of weird and boring.  As already noted, this film is about a man needing to tend to business while leaving behind an invalid wife and mentally ill son in a decrepit mansion.  He arranges for a nurse to look after them both.  Before he leaves, the father catches the son not taking his nightly injections (of what I'd like to know) and a very intriguing conversation follows.

""Sometimes I like to pretend I'm normal""
""But you're not normal""
""But I could be if you let me""

So sets the stage for the son keeping the nurse away and attempting to take care of his mother and himself to make his father proud.  Of course he chooses not to take his medication and things go horribly awry.  For example, he figures if he gives his mother more medication she'll get better faster.  Weirdness ensues and it all ends rather badly.

I really liked the physicality of the son.  He moves in a unique way as befitting his mental state.  The super fast motion of the son off his medication with everything as a blur and characters in a normal state moving slowly and monotonously through life was interesting but not enough.  I liked how the mansion was a main character as well and reflected its inhabitants.  The movie starts with an old bedraggled man in a precarious mental state roaming through a deteriorating mansion and then we go backwards to see how the character reached that state.  Okay.  But why would a health system great enough to perform an operation on sight at the mansion allow such conditions to exist?  Wouldn't the nurse have come much quicker to their aid knowing the exact state of affairs rather then allow it to continue for days until calling the police for help? The plot moved unnaturally, just to make things fit.  The son takes handfuls of pills each morning and injections at night.  For what?!?  It is never explained but we know he's been this way for a while.  What exactly is wrong with the wife/mother?  She has recently become an invalid since the photo of the happy smiling family looks recent.  She can stand but not walk?  What has happened to drastically change the happy family in the photo to what they have become now.  Bankruptcy?

3298882,2,B0011B9W6U,"I don't rightly know what to think or say about this little weird film.  Reading the synopsis was enough to give me a reason to try it.  Basically, a family, facing bankruptcy, is falling apart.  The father of the family has to leave his sick wife in the care of a nurse and his troubled man-child of a son.

The son, obviously mentally troubled, wants his parents to be proud of him and ends up cutting him and his mother off from the outside world, shutting out the nurse and trying to take care of his mom by himself.  From here, the story spirals down towards tragedy since the son obviously cannot care for his mother.

Okay.  So from the very beginning of the film, I didn't really buy into the whole plot of the film.  The acting was very off-putting originally, with the actor who plays James, the troubled son, alternating between decent and horrible in his portrayal.

As the story continued, the way the film was shot really kept me from being pulled into what was happening.  There are times when James will run from place to place and the camera work speeds up, to show his state of mind, I'm sure, and really odd music plays.  It's at moments like these where I start to look at the clock wondering...how much longer?

Even though it's been kind of billed as a horror film, it's not.  Sure, the events that occur are disturbing and it's definitely a bizzare little flick.  But, on the whole, I would categorize it more as a tragic drama than a horror film.

3298885,3,B0011B9W6U,"This film follows a mentally handicapped young man who is living with his father and invalid mother.  The film sets up early on that James has a severe mental illness that renders him unable to care for himself.  His mother Nancy is confined to her bed, while father Donald has his hands full caring for both.  But when Donald is called away on business, James gets angry that he isn't left in charge.  He wants to prove to his parents that he is the man of the house - so he locks the hired nurse out of the house and begins to try and take care of his mother.  Things quickly spiral out of control as James stops taking his medicine and ""forces"" his care onto his distraught mother.

The setup for the film is quite nice.  Rumley creates a soft-spot for the audience in James and his father.  Early scenes show James freaking out and his father lovingly taking care of him.  Later, as James begins to put his mother's life in danger, we do not feel so much angry with James, but rather we feel sorry for him.  This film is less about the danger faced by Nancy, and more about the sadness of James' strong desire yet incapicity to care for his mom.

Unfortunately, the main story ""ends"" about midway through the film, and the final act begins to fall apart.  James' psychosis begins to go into overdrive, and he has one of the strangest hallucinations I've seen in film.  Later, his father goes similarly nuts, and it begins to become difficult to follow the storyline.  By the end, it was difficult to tell who had done what to whom, and how much of what we saw really took place, and when.  This muddled final act undoes all the good the first half had set up.

Performances are good across the board, with Leo Bill having the most difficult job of the three bringing James' psychosis to life.  The character he creates is nearly laughable in the early portions of the film (think an amalgamation of the characters Rick and Vyvyan from the UK TV series, THE YOUNG ONES).  As the film progresses, the odd mannerisms become equally frightening and heartbreaking.

If Rumley had stretched out the middle portion of the film a bit longer, and had a more comprehensible ending, I might have recommended the film - as it is, it is largely a disappointment.  I give it three stars for good acting and an interesting opening portion.

The psychotic mentally incompetent son destroys his family, although the dad plays a huge role in this process by not being there for the dying mother. The movie rambles on through predictable scenes that closely match what might really happen if you put a mentally ill dullard in charge of a dying patient's care. Except for the random descents into violence, which are strange and pointless, just like most real violence.

3298887,3,B0011B9W6U,"A preference of director Simon Rumley for this film's title before its release was THE LIVING IN THE HOME OF THE DEAD since the work that he formulated is based round his potent emotional reactions to the death of his mother from cancer, an exhausting event for Rumley as well as for the disease's victim.  The film will be at least in part artistically inaccessible to those viewers who will be uncomfortable watching a rather nauseous compendium of scenes filled with the actions of an obvious madman, in addition to unbridled drug usage, gore, feces, and vomitus.  For the most part, Rumley employs a brilliantly expressionistic method in order to reflect his repugnance at recollecting the dismal three month decline into death of his mother, with his intent here obviously being communication to viewers of his ruinous sense of incertitude and bewilderment, quite conventional states for one observing another person gradually perish.  Because there is no particular linear aspect to the narrative, the tone of the film steadily becomes surreal, with incongruous and often ostensibly senseless scenes born from a nightmarishly burdened subconscious, and while handling of this type of episode seems at times laboured and in poor taste, a viewer should be aware of the internal flaying that became a primary determinant for the piece.  Shot in only eighteen days within the voluminous Cardigan Savernake House in Wiltshire, England, using eight of the derelict structure's 250 rooms, the picture is efficiently crafted by director, cast and crew, and offers a bravura turn from Leo Bill playing as addled son of a dying woman.  The film was in reality constructed during post-production editing, and there will be precious little for a majority of viewers to like, since the affair plainly is too repellent for most audiences.

Former Lord Donald Brocklebank's (Roger Lloyd-Pack) wife, Nancy (Kate Fahyl) is physically ill and is getting worse. Meanwhile, Donald's only son, James (Leo Bill), is delusional and a borderline psychotic who can't be trusted to be by himself. The family lives in the once extravagant, but now decaying Longleigh House that for a family of three is just way, way, too big. Donald has to leave for a few days and go to London to arrange financing for Nancy's surgery. He's not too worried because despite his family's problems, he's been gone before and Nurse Mary (Sarah Ball) has always taken care of things while he was away. Donald leaves while it is still dark and Nurse Mary hasn't arrived, yet. James wakes up and decides that Nurse Mary isn't needed and he will take care of his mother himself. He leaves the phone off the hook and bolts the doors. James does alright if there isn't any stress and if he's taking his medication properly, but he stops taking his evening medication and eventually begins confusing his pills with his mother's. What results is a confusing and dizzying nightmare that leads to tragedy.

I try to find at least one good thing in every film I see. The best thing about THE LIVING AND THE DEAD is that there is some really good acting in the movie. Unfortunately, most people are never going to notice the acting because the movie is so incredibly bad. For example, there is no explanation why Donald is no longer a Lord, or what exactly Mary is suffering from, or what happened to turn James from the happy young man he once was into the delusional and crazy person he has become. About a third of the movie is sped up (I assume to reflect the mental state of James) but this technique fails at its apparent purpose and becomes an irritating and annoying nuisance that distracts from the few good things going on in the movie. There's not much dialogue and what little there is as disjointed as the movie's structure. The lighting is horrible and the music is atrocious. Five minutes into the film I couldn't wait for it to end, but there was about eighty-five minutes left to go. THE LIVING AND THE DEAD is so bad that it is a movie that MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 wouldn't have even shown.",1209081600,,2415,4.56221198156682
8241322,2,B0011B9W6U,"This was, to say the least, a very different and interesting movie. With minimialist dialogue and fast-action sequences, the movie does become hard to follow. I guess the sprawling mansion makes the story somewhat interesting as James moves his mother in a wheelchair throughout the mansion.

As I said the dialogue is minimalist. There just wasn't much there. Hard to follow a movie or empathize with characters if we only see their actions and get no glimpse into what is going on inside them.

Many scenes were of ""fast-forward"" action sequences. This occured when it seems James was moving his mother in a wheelchair throughout out large mansion.

The story appears to be one where James' mother is bedridden and his father is trying to sell the expansive mansion. Father needs to leave to take care of business (a lengthy trip). A nurse was supposed to watch mother and son (son was not A-OK either). But the son, James, locks the nurse out and sets out to prove he can take care of his mother.

And thus the movie, sans much dialogue, seeks to show James attempt this juggling act.

This is not a movie to watch when tired.",1208995200,,1129,4.653266331658291
