7607370,4,B01AO6WLSS,"I will first say that this is a very difficult movie to review. Why? there are aspects of brutality (hence the name) that in the beginning you can't quite understand and to be honest at the end I don't think I still understood, I guess at the ending but that is the best I can do. I did figure a few things out as we went along. There are some very interesting points made throughout. Locked in a no-holds-barred MMA combat, Trevor and Derek are on a perpetual mission to beat each other to the very edge of death. I won't say too much more about the story but I will say about the actors and it is a 2 man movie. The character of Derek is awful as is the actor. The character and actor for Trevor was good because he had to play 2 characters, you will see. His real name is Morgan Benoit. I didn't like the ending I think. The brother was good too. Stay after the credits. maybe you can tell me who was behind it all. Would I recommend? Not to everyone.",1472688000,,954,4.079787234042553
7607371,1,B01AO6WLSS,"Two boring characters pummel each other in a cage match for a steak and peas dinner. The fights are bloody knuckles and smashed faces. The first one lasted a ridiculous 8 minutes. However, if you missed that they fight again and again in The Arena (Star Trek Gorn reference).

They are apparently held by aliens with a lot of white paint. The acting and dialogue was bad and the idea has been done.  Recommend ""The Human Race"" instead.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Pole dancer.",1464393600,,482,4.5813953488372094

8747895,1,B01AO6WLSS,Okay I watched it all the way through and I have yet to understand what the writer is trying to convey to us. If it was in book form I might have been able to understand what happened and why but something is lost in translation.,1478649600,,229,4.0
