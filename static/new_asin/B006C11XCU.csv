Personally the only thing I would do differently would be have the entire DVD play automatically vs me having to play each chapter, but however, I do see the value of the each chapter play.",1376524800,,274,4.48
8496265,1,B006C11XCU,"This dvd is formatted for European use. PAL Will not play on a PS3 in US.
Giving it one star because it will not play. If it is being sold in US then it need to be able to play in US",1375747200,,182,3.357142857142857
8496266,1,B006C11XCU,"I gave this DVD only one star only because when I tried to watch the DVD, a message came up saying that the disc was not compatable with my DVD player.  This is the first time I've seen a message like this on my DVD player.

I'm sure I would have given it a better rating if I were able to watch it because I love her youtube videos.  I was really disappointed in not being able to watch this.  Unfortunately I had to send it back.",1369612800,,431,3.9195402298850577
8496267,5,B006C11XCU,"Unfortunately the DVD is of type DVD-DL. It cannot play on any of my DVD players. It can play on my computer. The segment on equipment is thorough but I could not possibly afford to buy all those machines she advertised. The DVD could use a book to accompany it so that you can follow all her recipes while getting ideas from the DVD. The DVD provides an excellent introduction to RAW FOOD preparation. I would highly recommend it. But the buyer should beware that if a DVD player does not support DVD-DL, it will not play the DVD.",1368835200,,531,4.373737373737374
8496268,1,B006C11XCU,"Purchased this a while back and finally had a chance to view it and found that it will
NOT PLAY in any of the 4 DVD players in our home. A sign comes up on the screen and says
this DVD can not be played or recorded, another DVD player says, this disc can not be played and exits the disk......HELP! I would really like to see this!
(I can't send it back as I waited to long to play it.)",1363132800,4,386,3.7777777777777777
8496269,5,B006C11XCU,"I have been a raw enthusiast for the past few years, and I thought I knew most of what I needed to know by now. I loved the idea of watching Tanya go through it all again to refine my skills and to my surprise there was still a lot for me to learn! I love that the DVD is broken down into easily manageable chunks so it can be watched just before making something, or even at the same time! An awesome watch for anyone who is new to raw food, or is open to learning more and refining their skills.",1358553600,3,497,3.8823529411764706
8496270,5,B006C11XCU,"This is hands down the best DVD for those curious about starting with raw food or needing an inspirations.

Tanya's practical tips and recipe techniques are easy to follow, she presents very well (VERYl!) and seeing everything step by step is helpful for any novice.

I heard so much about 'green smoothie this', 'green juice that', but it wasn't until I watched Raw Food 101, when I finally understood what all the fuss is about.

I learned more in 2,5 hours watching Tanya in the kitchen, than I have in over a year of searching the net.

Two big thumbs up. Thanks!",1353283200,3,567,4.529411764705882
8496271,5,B006C11XCU,Tanya is one of the world's foremost experts on how to make the most of a vibrant raw lifestyle and diet. Her DVD will show you how to breathe new life into your raw food routine and create magic in your kitchen! She's also the patron saint of raw chocolate.  Her beautiful food really is 'Better Raw'!,1338336000,4,302,4.298245614035087
8496272,5,B006C11XCU,"If you are new to raw foods or confused about what steps to take,  Raw Food 101 is an awesome DVD to get you started. Tanya Alexseeva, Better Raw, lives in London and I absolutely love all that she is doing to help people live healthier lives.  Her 2 1/2 hour DVD is a complete beginners guide to raw food. The DVD is all in chapters so it is extremely easy to follow and go back and forth between the different subjects. I love being able to actually watch the recipes being created.  She starts off with the equipment she uses on a daily basis in her raw kitchen. She then goes on to green smoothies, nut milk and calcium, superfoods, the staples in her kitchen, sprouting, fermenting, dehydrating, sauces & flavors, five minute meals & desserts.  I received permission from Tanya to create one of her recipes from the DVD and I picked her delicious 'Curry in a Hurry' main dish meal. Oh my goodness this was so good with flavor plus!  My daughter dropped by and absolutely loved it too.  The cauliflower has all the properties to help build up your immune system and cleanse your body. It also has a lot of spices to help warm you up and satisfy. The recipe makes four large servings and is good for several days in the refrigerator. I highly recommend Tanya's DVD, even if you are not a beginner to raw foods.  Her recipes are excellent, nutritious and I just love her fun loving personality.  I know you will too.",1335744000,7,1418,4.406130268199234
