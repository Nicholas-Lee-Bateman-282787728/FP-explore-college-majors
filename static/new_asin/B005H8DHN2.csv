8472762,5,B005H8DHN2,"I am a big fan of Lucille Ball and enjoyed her movies and television shows over the years. She is completely off-beat, on the screen, while performing the comedy act. In this collection of three movies; Next Time I Marry; Go Chase Yourself; and Look Who is Laughing, selected from early stages in her career. My favorite is Next Time I Marry, which she co-stars with James Ellison.

This is a RKOs comedy of 1938 which generates the zany saga of a slap-happy heiress and a pick-and-shovel hero. Ball marries a government project worker Ellison to make her eligible for $20 million inheritance; then fly to Reno, Nevada so that she can annul the marriage and then wed a titled foreigner Lee Bowman, and enjoy the inheritance with him. The frantic battling of the newlyweds eventually leads to real romance and to a whimsical cross-country diversion. This part of the story sounds awfully similar to Frank Capras 1934 classic, It happened one night starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.

Go Chase Yourself is a story of Jo Penner; a goofy bank clerk who wins a swanky auto trailer. But the trailer is hijacked by two bank robbers with Penner going along for the ride. This ride culminates in rip-roaring out of control descent down the side of a mountain. Lucille Ball plays the hard boiled wife of Penner, and Robert Sisk produced this screwball comedy.

Look whos laughing (1941) casted several leading radio comedians including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. This is a nonsensical story about a small town entrepreneur and his schemes to lure an aircraft factory into the vicinity of town. Released just after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the film had a significant interest and appeal for the moviegoers. The film garnered sizable box-office revenue with a stand-out performance attributed to Lucille Ball as the secretary of Edgar Bergen. This is produced and directed by Allan Dwan.",1443484800,7,1905,4.928348909657321
