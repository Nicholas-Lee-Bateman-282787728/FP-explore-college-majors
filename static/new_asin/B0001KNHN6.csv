8013625,4,B0001KNHN6,"I saw this film many years ago on Showtime... and really liked it... The plot is pretty simple, like a noir, and really is a one location shot inside a bar... The acting is decent, and Maria Ford is what really makes this film hot! Maria Ford stripping and showing off her pre-boob job body is fantastic! Not much to say, but I like it!",1449878400,2,336,4.184615384615385
8013626,4,B0001KNHN6,"Four stars is a little generous, but three didn't seem to be enough. Among Maria Ford movies this is one that helped make her famous, mainly because of her willingness to get naked early and often, and to go above and beyond in her stripping scenes. However this one doesn't match ""Naked Obsession,"" ""Strip for Action,"" or ""Stripped to Kill""--even though basically all of these borrow from each other--mainly for the lack of full-frontal nudity and the rather weak sex scenes. The plot, though, probably is better than any of those others, and this includes not only some of Maria's best acting ever but also a really great turn by Bob McFarland as the criminal investigator.",1414195200,,675,4.827586206896552
8013627,3,B0001KNHN6,"This is a film that has more showgirls than murders.

In the first scene Jessica (Maria Ford) kills a man with cocaine and takes his money. Later she shows up at a bar needing work. She convinces Mitch (Matt Preston) to turn his bar into a strip club to the dismay of his wife (D.S. Case). Soon Jessica's past catches up to her, along with her desire to be top dog leads to a series of murders.

This wasn't a great film. It reminded me of the ""Poison Ivy"" films where a young girl manipulates an older man. There are plenty of stage scenes with dance acts, but overall the film was light on plot.

F-bomb, sex nudity (Maria Ford, Nikki Frite, Jane Stowe, Crescendo)",1408060800,,666,4.312
8013628,5,B0001KNHN6,"I first saw this movie when it came on either HBO, Showtime, TMC, or Encore (I can't remember which)one night a long time ago. I was only 11 years old at the time and my mom could not control what I would be watching while she was in the other room asleep. Anyway, just from watching this film, I had a huge crush on Maria Ford. She was hot, sexy, and it's a great film too. I'm 26 years old now and I had to purchase this DVD because I haven't seen this film in over a decade.",1339027200,3,477,3.877551020408163
