2917352,5,B000UAE7EA,"This is the dvd I've been waiting for!  She has it broken down into several warm ups, then different body parts broken down into sections.  Then she goes over combos that create a killer choreography at the end.

Sharon is one of the best teachers!  Great DVD and great price!",1191542400,6,276,4.46
2917353,5,B000UAE7EA,I was so excited to open my Amazon box when I got home yesterday. I have been to one of Sharon's workshops and this DVD makes me feel like I'm getting a personal one on one with her. The streatchin segment helps you to become more flexable and it was a treat to learn one of her dances. You rock Sharon Kihara!!!,1191542400,2,312,4.048387096774194
2917354,5,B000UAE7EA,"Among Tribal Fusion DVD's, this one is a definite keeper! The DVD is well organized in a way that makes sense and keeps things flowing well. Plus, Sharon is gorgeous to watch! The music and set are nice as well.

The workout portion begins with a yoga warm up and then Sharon takes us through a series of isolation drills (glutes, abs, back, shoulders, etc.). I didn't time it, but I think the workout lasted about 45 minutes. I found it very helpful to use a yoga mat for about half of the workout.
I like this workout because it definitely works up a sweat and gets you breathing, but it's not so hard that it becomes frustrating. I'm not in great shape and I could do it, though it took some effort! These are the drills you want to do in order to build up the muscle memory that will enable you to perform the luscious tribal fusion bellydance moves that are so popular these days!
After the workout, Sharon teaches four dance combinations. Then the four combinations are put together into a really nice tribal fusion style dance.

Sharon teaches while standing next to a mirror, making it easy to see what her body is doing. Her outfit is not distracting. She demonstrates the moves while a voiceover (Sharon's voice) explains them. This DVD seems to have a lot of thought and planning behind it. It omits the negative elements (such as distracting costumes, bad sets or annoying music) that ruin the quality of some other dance and workout DVD's.
Finally, Sharon performs the same dance she teaches in the DVD, only she adds her own style and grace. It's a lovely performance.
There is a bonus interview with Sharon and some ""credits"" where she thanks the people who have inspired her and helped her along her dance journey.

I really like this DVD and it is now part of my weekly rotation. Good quality DVD, well worth the purchase. Highly recommended!",1191456000,35,1859,4.559880239520958
2917355,4,B000UAE7EA,"Edited 9-2014 Edits are in parentheses.
It seems as if all of the tribal fusion DVDs have different things that are good about them. You don't really know what you're going to get until you buy it. This one is the shoulder shimmies. I haven't seen another video that shows how much attitude you can create just with those two humps on either side of your neck. She also shows you snake arms very well. You see a front and back view at the same time. Which helps show you just which muscles on your back should be moving.

Her stretch routine includes the splits which I can't do so I was just standing around for that part. (I have discovered that you can actually do this without being able to do the splits. However, it's not as easy or pronounced so it would have been nice if they would have added stretches to show you how to do the splits.) It also seems as if locking the movements into place was easier in watching this DVD. She makes the movement before the lock obvious so you can see what your muscles should be doing. (While the breakdown of the locking is better than most I've seen, I do feel like she moves on or picks up the pace a little too quickly. This is supposed to be a beginner/intermediate video and she moves on too quickly to really get it down at first.)

(For the warm up section I think there could be a lot more verbal ques. As it is right now you spend a lot of time doing it wrong just to see what she's doing.)",1321315200,,1444,4.172043010752688
2917356,4,B000UAE7EA,"While not a truly experienced student of belly dance, I have been a devotee of ""Shimmy"" on FiTV until the channel changed into marathons of ""I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant.""  Now, no ""Shimmy,"" and I'm tired of practicing to the one episode I TiVo'ed, not knowing it would all end the next day.  So when I saw this on sale & had a gift certificate, I scooped it up.  I tried it out today, and was not disappointed.

My first assertion is that this DVD is definitely not aimed at beginners.  As I'm still a beginner and used to the very broken down instruction method in ""Shimmy,"" quite a few times, I got lost.  But that excited me a little bit as I feel that gives me something to work toward.  When Sharon went through the movements at her slowest & most basic, I could usually follow along, even when not flexible or coordinated enough to actually complete them.  But when she speeds up, LOOK OUT!  She leaves me in the dust like the proverbial roadrunner.

This is not to say that Ms. Kihara's instruction is lacking.  I don't think it is.  I did appreciate her pointing at different muscle groups, often as she was using them for different moves, and found this rather helpful.  I noticed other reviewers were annoyed that she kept moving her hair around, but I also found this helpful, as I could see her back more clearly, as well as other muscles & areas she was highlighting.  I do side with the reviewers who were annoyed by the pants that covered her legs & feet, thereby not allowing much spying on what was going on there.  But since I've watched a lot of these Tribal Bellydance greats in person, I figured that'd be the case before I even saw the DVD.  Most of these chicks like their dancing trousers, and that seems to be part of a de rigeur outfit for Tribal Bellydancers in general.  I do wish, though, that during the teaching sequences of future Tribal BD instructional videos, the dancer might wear capris or knee-length yoga pants, just so I can see what's happening with the feet and at least part of the legs.

My second comment is that I really enjoyed the drills and learned new things from this DVD that I'd missed in faithful ""Shimmy"" watching. In the first minute of the arm drills, I had already figured out how I'd been doing snake arms incorrectly.  No wonder all of those Tribal Bellydance Chicks have such incredible back muscles--  a real snake arm is no joke, yo!  I already feel the middle top of my back complaining, and I am looking forward to more practice to learn how to do it correcly.  I felt similarly about the ab drills.  Some pieces slid into place that I didn't realize were out of whack.

While I do feel a little out of my depth while following along with this DVD, I am not sorry I bought it.  I think I am going to learn a lot.  Heck, I already have.",1315353600,,2801,4.359073359073359
2917357,5,B000UAE7EA,Received the dvd approximately 3 weeks after order in perfect condition.  Very happy with my purchase.,1280188800,,102,5.375
2917358,5,B000UAE7EA,"Other gals have been thorough enough describing the video. Sharon was very easy for me to watch - incredibly graceful - but something about her voice and persona also remind me of something very accessible, not intimidating. I feel like I could have played volleyball or basketball with her, and that makes me feel very encouraged to try more sensual moves like you have in bellydance.  Also, the way she describes and shows muscle isolations is great!! I've been Netflixing the heck out of bellydance instructional videos, trying to find one I will actually do and enjoy... This is it!",1268870400,,586,4.86
2917359,5,B000UAE7EA,"I enjoyed learning both the yoga stances in the beginning and the moves. It takes alot of practice to even get CLOSE to what it looks like but determination WILL pay off. I highly recommend this tutorial dvd because frankly, it was one of the easier ones I've seen and done, and it was FUN!!",1257552000,,291,4.3090909090909095
2917360,5,B000UAE7EA,if you do this dvd all the way it is such a great work out!!! i absolutely recommend this dvd it is my number one amongst even rachel brices instructionals. Sharon kihara is such an amazing person that radiates positivity this a great dvd companion to have.,1251590400,,257,4.48936170212766
2917361,4,B000UAE7EA,"For those who got lucky enough to meet this Gothic with a Smile Princess, this DVD truly reflects her attitude during workshops. She's very caring, you can visualize her moves as she is very precised with her body (I second the hair ""problem"" that sometimes can avoid watching a move) as mush as with her verbal explanations. With her sarcastic smile at herself in the miror, she encouraged us to do the same when we practice so we get used to it so it becomes natural on the scene. And she believes that it's helping to stop thinking how hard this movement is and to feel cool about it.
This long warm up is very progressive. I personnally have back problems, and I need a brief and easier warm up before I can start hers.
Great performance at the end, it's fun to see a combo you've worked on and feel the magic as she's performing it so perfectly.
Great music too.",1251504000,,867,4.3580246913580245
2917362,5,B000UAE7EA,"this dvd is great!! sharon is such an amazing dancer and they way she breaks the moves down is also good too. She has aimed this dvd for the less experienced TF dancer, so i feel confidant that a beginning dancer can buy this dvd and benefit greatly from it. Also, Sharon is a good teacher, unlike other dancers who dance well but teach horrendously. Sharon does both teach and dance very well.....",1247011200,,398,4.465753424657534
2917363,3,B000UAE7EA,"Sharon Kihara is a lovely, talented dancer with great visual presentation, but this DVD falls short when it comes to instruction or practice. The whole thing is only an hour and fifteen minutes, and much of that is spent on the combination. As far as the isolations go, Kihara is content to do as little as two repetions of each movement (as with the shoulder rolls, for example.) In contrast, the DVDs released by Ariellah and Asharah give us very thorough drills. Your arms will be falling off by the end of their shoulder sequences, if you can even get through them. I recommend renting or borrowing this DVD before you buy. It might be just your thing, for the long combination sequence. But if you're looking to practice your isolations, this one won't do it.",1241395200,,764,4.625
2917364,5,B000UAE7EA,"Before this video, Rachel Brice was one of my favorite bellydancers...but now Miss Sharon takes that place.  She brings joy to a dance, that often takes itself too seriously, come on girls smile a bit.  A beautiful performance and great instruction.",1238112000,,249,5.048780487804878
2917365,5,B000UAE7EA,"As much as I love Sharon Kihara, I hadn't planned to buy this one based on some of the negative comments in other reviews. I ended up with it anyway because the store didn't have the one I wanted, and I am so glad that I did.

First, I love Sharon's friendly, easygoing style. She's also better than most about offering tips and safety cautions in the yoga segment - which is absolutely invigorating.  I've owned and used Rachel Brice's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tribal-Fusion-Yoga-Isolations-Drills-for-Bellydance/dp/B000621452/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tribal Fusion - Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance</a>&nbsp;for several years and it's been my favorite up until now. However, if I do anything longer than the fifteen minute workout, I feel tired. After doing Sharon's yoga workout for the past week, I've consistently felt energized and invigorated - even when I was tired to begin with. The difference may be that Rachel's drills might be just a few seconds too long for my physical condition. In both the yoga and drills segments, I find it much easier to complete every single drill in Sharon's workout.  For those in better physical shape, this may not be pushing it enough but for me, it's perfect. I feel that I'm getting a great workout along with having gotten a good stretch. I'm working toward getting back into dancing after an injury and I also felt significant improvement in my hip work after just doing the workout a few times - which makes me question whether I was not taught properly when I was taking classes.  I believe that this is also due to Sharon's choice of verbal cues - or maybe my instructor was not doing a very good job. Her use of ""upper abs"" and ""upper(or)lower back"" instead of terms like ""tuck under"" have made a huge difference in the way that my brain talks to my muscles. She also really focuses on using the obliques, something my instructor rarely did - if ever - and this has been incredibly helpful as well. The Suhaila Salimpour booty dance thing has also helped more than I would have imagined.  I've done traditional gluteal squeezes for years and wasn't sure whether there would be a difference in simply changing the posture they're done in. There is. First, it's a lot harder! and sitting in straddle position makes you far more conscious of which muscles you are using. If I keep my hands on my thighs, I find that I am using all the muscles Sharon says not to use! I find it easier to focus on the correct muscles if I place my hands just above my butt. This is a phenomenal workout and I feel like I'm going to be back in shape in no time. I completely agree with Sharon in that it is critical to our development as dancers to build strength in the muscles we use for dance.

While I'll always love Rachel's workout, I was disappointed upon purchasing it that she does not teach any combinations. Sharon's are fun and very easy for an intermediate dancer to pick up.  I'm not sure about beginners, but based on my own experience I would guess that this is one of the better tribal instructional dvd's for those at that level.  I own and have tried around a dozen bellydance instructional DVD's including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Instructional-Bellydance-With-Jillina-Level-1-2-3/dp/B0000CEB69/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Instructional Bellydance With Jillina: Level 1, 2, & 3</a>, a few of Dolphina's and Veena and Neena's DVD's and several from World Dance New York. I've seen very few that are suitable for beginners.

Sharon teaches in front of a mirror so that we can see both front and back, but there are also closeups of her face where she is speaking directly to the student. This contributes to her friendly style but in a few places, we're unable to see both aspects. This is the fault of the person doing the filming, not the instructor, and is only slightly annoying.

Sharon's workout has bumped Rachel's down to number two in my favorites, but I plan to use both of them together. I do love the way that Rachel broke hers down into 15, 20 and 45 minute workouts and wish that Sharon would have done that with hers.  However, both DVD's have chapters and it's very easy to skip around to create a workout that suits your schedule and using both together will build your strength and develop your skills.",1236297600,3,4377,4.925373134328358
2917366,4,B000UAE7EA,"I did view alot of the reviews for this product before I purchased it.

I tried the video for the first time yesterday.  I liked it.

One improvement could be the explanation of the yoga positions before implementation.  When Sharon would mention moving into a position, I would have to break my concentration to see exactly what exactly she meant.

I did appreciate the isolation movements broken up into sections.  This means that I can work out the part of the body that I want, or skip a part, say, for instance, I'm feeling sore.

I did not expect this to be a beginning belly dance instructional dvd, and it is not. As I stated before, I am not disappointed in the product.",1234828800,,679,4.471544715447155
2917367,3,B000UAE7EA,"sorry, she is a cute talented girl but as far as dance instruction goes?  nope.  i mean it's okay. lets say, i can see what she is doing but as far as her explaining it, nah.  her yoga and stretching session in this dvd is awesome, i really haven't come across a better yoga instructor on dvd.  kihara should stick to dance but become a yoga instructor.",1230076800,,353,4.223880597014926
2917368,2,B000UAE7EA,"I was so disappointed after all the 4 & 5 star reviews! I hope serious dancers read this.  I am writing from the perspective of a professional dance teacher ... your milage may vary.

The good?
Ms. Kihara is lovely, a competent teacher, and has superb style.  The combinations she presents are varied and represent the best of modern tribal fusion. Her material is first-rate.

The bad?
As a learning tool, this video was a terrible disappointment.  It was produced a bit like MTV.  Sexy camera angles and quick cuts to new angles.  Sadly ... this is exactly what I DON'T want if I am trying to learn a dance.  Every time I got used to the camera angle they would switch to another angle.  The moment I re-oriented my brain to ""that"" angle ... cut to a different angle.

A few minutes of this cut, cut, switch, switch and I couldn't even tell right from left anymore ... much less learn the combinations she was trying to teach.

The Pretty?
In this DVD you purchase Sharon's pretty, packaged, image ... but nothing of real value if you want to learn the actual dance combinations.

I feel sad about my $$ wasted on this.  Sad about Ms. Kihara's talents wasted.  The combinations are wonderful and i really wanted to learn them ... sadly this DVD is more for ""fans"" than dancers.  This would have been a 5 star instructional video if they had shot from ONE camera angle and showed the dancer's full body.  Alas.",1228953600,15,1411,4.474509803921569

2917370,4,B000UAE7EA,"This was a good instructional video. It is a little difficult when the main subject/instructor doesn't speak and the instructions are voice over if you are hearing impaired because you miss the visual component. That said, the instructions were clear, the quality of the video professional and the camera angles helpful rather than abstract.",1225756800,,341,5.333333333333333
2917371,4,B000UAE7EA,"This is a very detailed, good bellydance DVD.  It doesn't teach anything new, but is pleasant and will teach you a fair amount of bellydance technique.

2917372,5,B000UAE7EA,This DVD is currently my favorite and the one I do the most. Sharon is so engaging and talented! I *love* the choreography and have used almost all of the combos in my own routines. Another must for any bellydancer!!,1221091200,,216,4.425
2917373,5,B000UAE7EA,I have been doing alot of Tribal dance study and I have recently added this video to my collection. In comparison to the other Indigo Girl related videos this one seems to be the funest. Its very step by step and its got different techniques for the warm up and dance portion which is always a plus. Sharon Kihara is absolutley adorable and she will make you smile when you do this video.,1219795200,,388,4.328767123287672
2917374,5,B000UAE7EA,"I found this dvd a valued addition to my collection. The drills and exercises are something I plan on doing regularly as I can see I am improving after doing it just once! Sharon Kihara's explanations of how your muscles move to create the shimmies and rolls are excellent.
I recommend this to belly dancers who have had a little training already and have a teacher on hand as some of the moves could be difficult to get the first time around.
If you plan on improving your dancing quickly get this dvd!",1214697600,,503,4.419354838709677
2917375,5,B000UAE7EA,"This has quickly become one of favorite dvds to work with at home. Sharon gives some great drills for working on muscle memory, a nice set of strengthening exercises and of course the yummy combos we so love. Although the dvd is done in the voice-over style, which usually gets on my nerves, Sharon has so much darn personality she doesn't have to say anything.

The yoga warm-up is just the right thing to get your muscles stretched out and ready for the work ahead. She then puts you through a few thigh, core and glute conditioning exercises before leading you into a challenging, yet not overwhelming, set of drills working from the shoulders down to the hips. The combos are fun and Sharon is a great teacher, the instruction is not in voice-over for the combos. Yay!

All-in-all, this is a fun technique building video and would be an asset to anyone's library. My only beef is that there is no cool-down, so be sure to stretch when you're done.",1207180800,,951,4.555555555555555

I don't agree with the comments saying that Sharon's not good at present in front of the camera.  She is gorgeous and she moves her hair several times only to make sure you can see her movement more clearly.  The choreography is little short for me.  If it had been longer or included two short ones, I wouldn't hesitate to give it a 5-star.",1206921600,,424,4.397435897435898

2917378,5,B000UAE7EA,"Having already amassed a collection of belly dance DVDs, I was a little worried that this video would just recap things I had already seen or learned. In fact, one will recognize a lot of exercises from Suhalia's and Rachel's films, but this video takes some of the best bits and fits them altogether for a challenging, but not overwhelming workout, one that works out the whole body, but is easily broken down when you just wanna work, say, your torso. Furthermore, Sharon places more emphasis on the using the back and shoulder muscles, and gives a few new (to me, at least) techniques for 'pop' moves. I would recommend this with the first Rachel Brice video (the practice companion, I haven't seen the new one yet), then try out Suhalia's buns workout (very, very challenging.) Kudos to Sharon for making sure to demonstrate moves from multiple angles so we can see the weird muscle contractions.",1205107200,,900,4.7756410256410255
2917379,5,B000UAE7EA,"Like a few have said before... definitely not for beginners! Have some familiarity with bellydance before trying this DVD.  It is also recommended that you do a 15 minute cardio type workout before doing this video. I find that doing this helps loosen up the muscles before diving into the yoga warmups. While I am not particularly skilled at yoga, I have found ways of modifying the movements that work with my ability and still give me the benefit of the stretch.

I love the drills and isolation exercises on this DVD! They are challenging, but not too frustrating for me. I know with practice I'll be able to catch up eventually. Up until recently I've only been doing up to through the drills, but now I've started exploring the combinations too. They are broken down nicely. It will take some time for me to 'get it' but I know that is because I'm not the fastest at 'getting it' with dance combos.

2917380,5,B000UAE7EA,"Sharon explains VERY WELL what she's doing, and with a smile!

The combinations and the choreography are very motivating.",1202428800,,317,4.578947368421052
2917381,4,B000UAE7EA,"I really like this DVD. It has fun choreography and it is an actual full dance. The only down side is that she just goes straight thought the choreography, instead of breaking it down as if you were in a class. However, I understand that it takes a long time to break it down and the DVD has only so much time, so as long as you have a remote to rewind, your good.  It is great for a person like me that is very familiar with yoga and has already been trained in other forms of belly dance and is looking for tribal technique. I would not recommend this for somebody who is already very familiar with tribal belly dance.",1202428800,2,620,4.12396694214876

The drills are a great way to learn the moves as well as being a good workout on their own.  The choreography is easy to learn as it is broken down into combinations.  Parts of it are a challenge but with repetition they are managable.  Sharon's beautiful performance of the choreography demonstrates what can be achieved with discipline and passion.

This DVD does not go over and over the moves like some others but if you use the reverse button on your remote, you can repeat them as often as you like.

I honestly felt that this one was just a rework of Rachel's Yoga Drills DVD (which is truly brilliant and every bellydancer should own it).  I think Sharon is a gorgeous woman and lovely dancer but needs a lot more practice and feel more comfortable in front of the camera. I am quite disappointed by this one.

Her combined moves of abdominal, hips, and arms create a smooth elegance of muscular flow, displaying a true feminine strength along with her through-and-through beauty.

2917388,3,B000UAE7EA,"I am a fan of the Bellydance Superstars so I was looking forward to this Sharon Kihara video.  Unfortunately, I don't recommend it for the following reasons:
1)  Her outfit covers her legs so that you can't see what her legs are doing during the movements! Also she was facing a mirror but her image was so far away I couldn't see her reflection.
2)  I do not feel she tried to connect with me as an learner. The voiceovers and the fact that she did not look into the camera contributed to this impression.
3)  She is a beautiful woman but seemed overly concerned with her appearance.  For example, she always moved her hair into position before moving into a new position. Sometimes her hair obscured what her abs were doing.  Also after movements, she stopped to pose and smile at herself in the mirror.  seemed to spend a lot of time smiling at herself in the mirror.
4)  This is NOT for beginners to bellydance.  Very few cautions were given during the yoga sequence.  Very little repetition of the movements.
What I ENJOYED:
1)  The set was visually appealing.
2)  Sharon is a beautiful and graceful dancer.  Cool tatoos.
3)  Sharon has a very pleasant, well modulated voice.
4)  Her interview at the end of the DVD was very personal and interesting.
If you are looking for how-to-do the tribal movements and practice drills I recommend Bellydance Yoga Conditioning with Ariellah.  Also a good value is Bellydance Basics and Beyond with Jenna for learning general bellydance movements.",1195257600,75,1490,4.694980694980695

It was very tiring even though I have been doing East Coast Tribal Bellydance with Sera video for about a month, I still found Sharon Kihara to work up a sweat. Afterwards I was tired but my body has been worked to it's potential. i am very pleased with this video and hope to have fun with it.",1194912000,,399,4.405405405405405
2917390,4,B000UAE7EA,"Sharon Kihara is an excellent dancer and a pleasure to watch in this video. I find the workout to be too short though. My favorite part is the abs strengthening (the only section that makes me sweat), especially those excercises for the obliques. The combinations could have been broken down in a little bit more detail and a practice part is definitely missing. There's also no cool down. The entire instruction is in Sharon's voiceover and sometimes the text and the video are a little bit asynchronous which is somewhat confusing until you go through the video a few times. There's also a short introductory section that is impossible to skip. Despite all those little complaints the DVD is very good. The photography is outstanding. I absolutely loved Sharon's makeup and outfit that is almost an advertisement for Melodia pants. The bonus interview adds a delicious personal touch to the whole thing. Taken together, this video is a pleasure to watch and is worth the price you pay for it.",1194480000,,994,4.852941176470588
2917391,5,B000UAE7EA,"I bought this video because they didn't have the one I thought I wanted.  What luck.  This is a wonderful DVD.  I have quite a bit of belly dance experience, but this DVD really sharpened my isolations and taught me which muscles to use for each move.  I finally ""get"" how to layer now that I am using the correct muscle groups.
I like the way she teaches.  The music is good, and subtle.  Her instruction is clear and concise; she explains which muscle groups to use when.  The choreo at the end is fun and has variety.
You start out with yoga.  Just a few sun salutations.  No pretzels required.
Then you do some exercises.  These have really helped me, especially the exercises to power your shimmies.
Then there is a section on isolations.  This is not a comprehensive run down of all isolations.  Beginners will eventually need another DVD to fill in the blanks.  The moves she teaches are explained well.  I would have liked her to drill some moves longer, but that would have made the DVD much longer. (I bought another DVD for drills, and I find they get boring.  I use this DVD regularly because it isn't boring.)
The choreo uses all the isolations and blends it into a nice little dance.  I enjoyed this choreo, and found it useful for my own dancing.  After explaining the sections and practicing them she puts it all together in a dance which you do a few times.  Finally she dances the choreo in costume and adds her own personal flair.
I like this DVD.  I now own several, but this is my favorite.  Good for cleaning up my isolations.  Good for building stamina.  Good for building strength and control.  Good for beginners (though you will eventually need another DVD to learn the rest of the basic moves.)  Good for  intermediates who want to build strength for cleaner movements and endurance.
I use this DVD 2-3 times a week, and I have been for the past 2 months.
Edit -- I have now bought copies for a couple of friends as gifts, because that was the only way they would return my copy.  This is a great DVD.",1194307200,3,2028,4.4135135135135135
2917392,5,B000UAE7EA,"This dvd is really PERFECT! Sharon explains all you need to be a good tribal bellydancer! The dvd is well organized; the first part is dedicated to exercises for strenghtening all the muscles involved in bellydance, then Sharon teaches undulations, shimmies, arms, chest and hip movements with her own particular style.
She is the first bellydancer teaching hip shimmy by using glutes contractions instead of leg movements! At the end, a gorgeous choreography and an interesting interview to Sharon close the dvd.",1193443200,2,513,5.2682926829268295
2917393,5,B000UAE7EA,"Sharon Kihara has a presence all her own. She's deliciously cool, a pleasure to look at and seemingly effortlessly elegant. On her first instructional video, she takes you through a yoga warm up, short muscle isolation drills, and four stylish combinations that reverberate with shimmies.

The warm up
There are two parts to this. The first is a variant of the yoga sun salutation. It includes the triangle and warrior poses. The second part has you doing some ""straddle squats"". Next is a section that warms up and drills the glutes, muscles that belly dancers use to power their hip work, making movements sharper and more controlled. In this little drill, Sharon gets herself into a split position, tough to achieve for most people. She even does a  shimmy in this position. To get the abs stronger, Sharon goes on to do some crunches and works the obliques. This drill ends with a yoga pose for the back relief to counter the pressure you may have felt during the crunches. Then there's a bit of an arms drill which takes you through shoulder diamonds, shimmies and snake arms. The chest drill followed by the torso drill has the usual stuff you'll find on belly dance videos, but more briefly. The torso drill demonstrates the sharpness of Sharon's undulations. There's an even tinier section quickly taking you through the vertical figure eights and small pelvic circle or ""ami"". If you haven't been doing any drills, this may be a nice beginning. If, like me, you have, it's more like a demo than a drill. A little more time is spent on hip ups and downs and shimmies. All of this is done to Indian-flavored music. Surprisingly, there are no safety tips and not many posture reminders. That tempts me to lop off a point, but considering it's not aimed at beginners, I'm inclined to let it go.

Combinations
American Tribal Style or ATS parentage shows in the four combinations Sharon takes up. It would have been nice if she'd have shown the combination first and then went on to explain it. For each combo, she tells you what has to be done, and then shows you the whole piece. There's no dance-along or practice built in. Again, I'm tempted to take a point off for that. Every other tribal instructional video I have (and that would be about 15 of my 87 video collection of belly dance videos) does take you through some practice. The combinations are full of rather nice shimmies, very graceful arm moves and style and attitude. Sharon is such a pleasure to watch that I don't think she deserves any points off. Especially when the video is entirely affordable. The combinations finally are danced at one go in a choreography to Bollywood's Chaiyya Chaiyya.

The entire instruction is in Sharon's voiceover. Chapters broken down and easy to get to. I'd recommend actually watching the ""bonus feature"" first. It's an interview (except there's no one interviewing her)  of Sharon and she tells you a bit about the video.

I wouldn't recommend this video for an absolute beginner. And for others who've been dancing already, I'd say do explore the entire lot available now. Some do offer better warm ups, others definitely have stronger and longer drills, and some have more combinations. I do a lot of drills and yoga, and so this nowhere near makes me sweat. If you're like me though, you'll just be delighted to include it in your collection and will love working with a new set of combinations to add to your repertoire. If ten new tribal fusion instructional videos were to be released this month, I'm very afraid I'd buy the lot.

As I said, right at the beginning, no matter what else you get out of this video, you'll get the pleasure of watching this lovely dancer.",1192838400,43,3681,4.6976744186046515
2917394,5,B000UAE7EA,"Nicely indexed, high quality DVD. Very clear photography, how-to's of tribal fusion movements and movement combinations, plus warmup exercises and a demonstration of the combinations put together. The combinations are a lot of fun to do, with a variety of movements, and visually appealing as well.

There is also a section where Sharon acknowledges the instructors who inspired her the most, including their photos (includes Suhaila and others). This is a very nice touch.

Sharon uses some terms which will be familiar to students who have studied with Suhaila, such as the verbal cue ""upper back"" (referring to the muscle contraction which results in the chest lifting). Students, especially those who have studied with Suhaila, will find this method of describing movements helpful.",1191715200,,786,5.382113821138211

8212457,3,B000UAE7EA,"This is the first bellydance DVD I ever bought. I took a bunch of beginning American Tribal Style bellydance classes and became addicted! I like ATS but wanted to expand my horizons. This was a good start. The warmup is a yoga ""sun salutation"" which I actually enjoy (and I'm not a yoga person.) I had never done shoulder diamonds and some of the locks, and the coreo at the end was cute. I think overall this is a good beginner DVD and it'll give you a little taste of tribal fusion.",1389484800,,484,4.271739130434782
8212458,3,B000UAE7EA,"Sharon has some good yoga and drills, but some of the drills will be out of reach for some dancers (such as myself) who cannot sit in open splits and get my glutes to jump like hers can. Oh we'll, it gives you something to strive for.

Then form the drills you immediately go into choreography and if you don't have a good basis in tribal or dance, you'll be left in the dust. For who do, this DVD is a good way to absorb Sharon's style. The other reviews saying that this DVD only showcases the the dancer are right, but Sharon is some nice eye candy.",1378080000,2,552,4.111111111111111

8212460,5,B000UAE7EA,"I attended a workshop with Sharon Kihara in 2009 and I was glad to see that her DVD delivers the same great experience--a good mix of stretches, exercises, drills, combinations and a choreography taught with Kihara's warm and sometimes humorous teaching style (although she is much more serious in the DVD.)

The DVD starts out with a nice yoga warm-up followed by some conditioning exercises often over-looked on other DVDs.  Again she does these weird butt exercises that she also did in her seminar--I am not sure if I will every use these in a choreography of my own, but at least it was something new.

Despite being on the fence when it comes to tribal style belly dance, I can't help but like Sharon Kihara.  She has a different take on everything--shoulder ""diamonds"" instead of shoulder rolls, etc.  In her bonus interview, she explains how ""tribal doesn't have to be cute and sexy--it CAN be..."" Tribal gives belly dancers a choice, and at best, legitimizes belly dance so people don't say, ""You're a bellydancer?!!!  Aww, you don't have to do that.  You have options.""

Comparing this DVD to the Rachel Brice arms DVD--this is a way better investment.  Some may consider Rachel Brice a better dancer, but I feel that Sharon Kihara is the better teacher, a least judging from my experiences.

All in all, this is a good belly dance workout DVD in the tribal style and definitely one of the better DVDs I've tried.  Every muscle feels lightly worked and I can't wait to hop on youtube to check out some of Sharon Kihara's recent performances.",1356998400,,1551,4.728624535315985
8212461,2,B000UAE7EA,"I agree that this dvd is overrated.. I think it fuels Kihara's huge ego, the info in the dvd is very basic and it really just showcases her and how cool she is. It is well known that Kihara has 3 serious back injuries- hernias from her dancing during and after she filmed the dvd, so it just doesn't make sense to me that she talks so much about the proper way of doing a movement. Asharah, Brice, Jake's dvd are a serious dance tool if you want to learn and take your dancing to the next level",1340323200,,494,4.051020408163265
