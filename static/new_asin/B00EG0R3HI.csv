8605172,3,B00EG0R3HI,"While Andrew Martin is a good presenter and I will watch the presentation of ""Crushing Black with the Deadly Ponziani"" again, this presentation is basically nothing more than a review of games. There is no comparison between the purpose and quality of ""Crushing Black with the Deadly Ponziani""  and either of the very structured presentations of GM Simon Williams i.e. The Killer Dragon  or that of GM Eugene Perelshteyn, ""Destroy White with the Accelerated Dragon"". However, if you already have a book on the Ponziani that deals with pawn structure and a variety of plans, and tactics in the opening, then this would be a nice accompanying set of game examples. (Andrew Martin does a much better job in his presentation and teaching method in ""The Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez."")
