5909080,5,B00EE8AIV0,"This documentary featured all of the depth I feel other recent documentaries about comic book heroes and villains miss. It was a very in-depth look into superheroes and their influence on popular culture. What I particularly enjoyed was how the documentary stayed focused on the comic books and their creators instead of other multimedia forms featuring superheroes. While such forms have their place and I'm grateful for what they've done with comic books, it's the COMIC BOOKS that should primarily influence the innovation and creativity of comic book characters and creators.",1385337600,,579,5.373626373626373
5909081,5,B00EE8AIV0,"It was great to see so many of the luminaries of the field involved in the making of this.  Getting to see the actual people from every age of the field commenting on their work is amazing.  Having them cover so many of the historical highlights, too.  About the only big issue they didn't cover was the big paper shortage in the early 70's.

Seeing it once on broadcast isn't enough.",1385251200,,384,4.366197183098592

The second part deals with comic book superheroes from the late 1950's to the late 1970's.  The third part tells about what happened to comic book superheroes from the late 1970's to today.

5909085,5,B00EE8AIV0,"This is the kind of product that should be shown in colleges teaching the Comic Arts and Writing or in Film Schools. Liev Schreiber narrates the nearly 3 hours of material which begins during the Golden Age of comics and runs right up to the current era. It is a fast moving and in-depth piece that to those of us making our own comic works is also inspirational. To comic fans, this is a terrific addition to their DVD collections right up there with Comic Book Confidential, Comic Book Heroes Unmasked, The Mind of Alan Moore, Todd McFarlane-The Devil You Know, and Will Eisners doc on Sequential Art. Add all of these to your comic collection and be inspired as you create your own piece of comic book history.  Excelsior!",1382745600,19,725,4.576923076923077

This really delves deeply into comic books, the roots of this graphic fiction medium, & it's long lasting impact in popular culture. Personally this is one of the best documentary's on the subject since ""Secret Origin: The Story of DC Comics"" from 2010. Everyone should see this.",1382227200,22,523,4.758241758241758

5909096,5,B00EE8AIV0,"Hello true believers, I am just another nerd who loves nerdy documentaries.

This is a wonderful buy as a DvD. It succinctly explains the history of super hero comics in the 20th century, but there is a give an take to that.

The key to a documentary is facts and for a nerdy subject like this (where the people most involved are professional escapists and by nature divorced from facts) two things get in the way.

Idealism is the first obstacle. Obviously you can't devote time to a subject without love or need for the subject, but love for the subject deifies factors that are not a part of history. Obviously the history here did not start with something as overreaching as the concept of super heroes (You, like in Neil Degrass Tison's Cosmos where they tries to make Gilgamesh into a super hero?), but they did not dwell on more immediate inspirations like the Scarlet Pimpernel or Zorro or the kinds of books the creators of modern comics would read before they became the creators more iconic characters like Superman, Batman, and the Joker. Much like many of the Walt Disney documentaries I purchase there are moments where research, retrospect, and insight into the events and repercussions of objective information becomes ""Golly gee, what a better world this imaginary thing made"". Again, this is to be expected when wide eyed nerds try to tell the truth about people and subjects before their time with wide eyed love. I can take that obstacle in any documentary.

Indignation is the bigger second obstacle. Whether it is comics, television, film, or animation, these art forms are an industry and these industrialist are artists. Which means you have the back stabbing of a competitive world of work meeting with people less likely to be stable about it. The older artists and writers give the best perspective in this documentary because time humbles all tempers and egos, but then you get to the creators from the 1990s and suddenly the facts are gone. Todd McFarlene in this documentary really miss evaluates his role in the era of the comic boom and the establishment of image comics (though he is still an important figure head of the time with allot of good in sites to share) as does the writers of the Death of Superman books. This was the time period where new comic companies were risking it all, 90% of comic shops closed, and the economy of comics collapsed.........but all we got out of the insiders in THIS documentary is ""Here is how I did the daring thing and wrote a darker story.........and somehow the economy of my industry fell apart. I don't know. Does not matter. Want to read the issue of Batman I wrote where he found his first grey hair?"". It is really disappointing to say the least to have such a complex and charged time skimmed over because the artists they asked still had chips on their shoulders.

But again, this is still a good documentary set. I recommend you look up an internet reviewer by the name of SFDebris and his recent miniseries covering the Rise and Fall of the Comic book industry in the late 80s and early 90s (currently 7 parts long on the Blip internet channel). It covers the artists, the investors, the venture capitalists, the market, the shipping, the battle of egos in every office, and every inspired mistake along the way. It damn near picks up all the slack this dvd left hanging behind it.",1437091200,2,3364,4.685279187817259

5909110,4,B00EE8AIV0,This was similar to a special done on History Channel several years ago.  This is longer but still very general about super hero comics.  I learned a few new things (half of the US read comics in the 40s???!!).  A few neat extras like the writer of the 60s Marvel hero theme songs (very NY cabaret).,1397520000,2,299,4.303571428571429
5909111,5,B00EE8AIV0,"This is a great film that examines every comic book Superhero and their influence to the comic industry. Without the influence of the first Superhero Superman we would have nothing! The impact of the character Superman inspired people to come up with their own Superheroes that people love today, so give Superman a little more respect.  Based on my opinion Superhero's are not just for kids, but are for adults as well. Kids may ware Superhero clothes and watch cartoons and movies, but they do not read comic books anymore. Adults Do! If you walk into any comic shop, you will not find a single child in there, except adults. This movie explains everything you need to know about comic book history and is a wonderful dvd to add to any Superhero fans collection. Just to point it out there they show very little photo's toward the end of the film, towards our current time from the movie Man of Steel but say nothing about it and say in no way how it impacted the comic book world like they do with the other superhero movies, You know why? Man of steel was a horrible film that ruined Superman, had no character study, a horrible plot, and was about dumb and unnecessary, non stop fighting.",1397174400,4,1193,4.5488372093023255

5909116,5,B00EE8AIV0,"The first two segments of this documentary are wonderful for someone, like myself, who only had a cursory understanding of comic book history. They contain great interviews with people from the era, and do a great job of breaking down the cultural significance of superheros, albeit it in broad terms.

The third section, covering the late 70s to today offers little substance. It's a licky-split summary of the era without much attention plaid to the cultural significance of superheros. There is a brief section dealing with 9/11 that attempts to dig into the role that comics played during that time, but otherwise the documentary accidentally suggests that comics don't carry the substantive weight they may have once carried.

Overall, it's an enlightening and easy to digest piece and I highly suggest it for those looking for an approachable introduction to comic book history.",1392681600,,884,5.174825174825175
5909117,5,B00EE8AIV0,I watched this documentary when it aired on PBS & I'm thrilled to see it released on Blu-ray. Hosted & narrated by Liev Schreiber the movie covers the pulp influenced early days of the Great Depression to the thrilling movies of today. My favorite parts are the interviews with the legendary creators. Sadly the last interviews with Joe Simon & Joe Kubert.

5909119,2,B00EE8AIV0,"I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary. The first part covered the golden age of comics quite well. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Also, on a possitive note, some of the extra features were really fun like seeing the guy who wrote those classic Marvel Superhero themes we all grew up with, among the other extras. What really went downhill for me was part 2 & 3 of this show. Now don't get me wrong. I do belive that characters such as The Falcon & Luke Cage had importance and should be covered. However, they should not have been chosen to cover most of the program. I really wanted more discription and mention of the more A-list characters such as Thor, Doctor Doom, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, ect, ect. Instead, once again, we're duely force fed the overly left liberal jazz getting down on the Reagan era establishment. If I knew that this program was aiming at some radical political arena, I would have passed on this all together. ""Never-Ending Battle"" indeed!",1391731200,,980,4.703488372093023
5909120,5,B00EE8AIV0,"I originally saw this on PBS and I was amazed at how good it was, so I had to add it to my collection. If you think comics are kid stuff, this will change your mind.

This is very well done, intelligent and respectful story of comics from the begging in the 30's all the up through modern day blockbuster movies. But its more than a retelling of comic book superhero history. Its intelligent and insightful, explaining how historical events and societal attitudes influenced the storylines and characters. This doc makes it clear that writers and artists weren't writing kids entertainment, rather, illustrating and interpreting issues of the day. War, racism, you name it, were all discussed within comic pages, making those topics palatable to young audiences.

If you're a comic fan, I guarantee you'll love it. If you aren't, you'll come away with an understanding of why comic are and important artistic medium.",1391472000,3,916,4.941558441558442

5909127,5,B00EE8AIV0,"Comic books have come a long way from ""all in color for a dime"" just as WWII loomed. Today $3.99 is the new ""dime"" for comics themselves. Don't get me started on the prices to see the blockbuster movies their mythologies have spawned. From the ""work for hire"" sweatshops of the '40's to the corporate movies moguls of today, comic publishers have given us an American mythology which has moved from disposable to must see.
  This is an excellent overview of the now recognized art form which grew up along with those generations who loved it in their youth. Comics are a visual art form and the visuals abound in this 3 hour survey. We see the seminal images and hear from some their creators who have survived with their characters.
  As a Boomer, I followed Infantino's DC silver age pantheon of the '50's and embraced the kinetic Kirby explosion at Marvel in the '60's. When I reveled in  the resurrection of Captain America or savored Jim Steranko and Neal Adams arrival on the scene; when Spidey tried to save a kid tripping on drugs or we learned that Green Arrow's ward Speedy was an addict, I did not realize I was reading history.
  Nothing says mainstream like a PBS special. SUPERHEROES: A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE explains how the comics have survived both market pressures and marked prejudice to rise from book burnings to the bookshelves of libraries, from corner drug stores to college courses. After your senses savor this vision of an art form which arose from reprinting the Sunday Comics in newspapers, run to your libraries where almost a century worth of comics greatness is collected as graphic novels both new and retrospective. If you don't want to run, you can now download digital versions, but this disk will whet your appetite for the output of these American visionaries. Stay young at heart with a visual mythology as old as time.",1388707200,,1856,4.745341614906832

Lets stick to comic books and superheroes people.

5909131,3,B00EE8AIV0,"This is part of an apparently growing trend in documentary films to analyze and interpret the subject matter of comic books, superheroes and superhero films. At roughly 3 hours long, this feature discusses superheroes starting with Superman and the Golden Age of comics and ending with contemporary happenings in the comics industry, and impressively includes in the introduction a short piece on pulp magazines (which comic books and superheroes spawned from).

Superhero films are not the focal point, but information about them are littered throughout the piece. Still lacking (and no documentary has ever really covered this) is any coverage of the comic strip. No mention of the influence that great strips like Terry and the Pirates, Flash Gordon, The Phantom (the first masked hero) or The Peanuts had on superhero comics.

This is at least the 3rd ""all-inclusive"" documentary about superheroes that has been done and while it may be one of the best, it is not the best. That honor goes to The History Channel's wonderful documentary called Comic Book Superheroes: Unmasked. That one is only about 100 minutes and seems to cover the gist of what's presented here (though it was put out in 2003).

I also found Schreiber to be an unconvincing and disengaging host. I think that other documentaries on the subject have done better jobs on the subject. It had pretty decent production values. It was well edited but, it also falls at giving a really well stated case about why the genre has truly persisted despite its function as an anachronism in our society. I am also totally put off by the fact that a company like Milestone Media, which led the way in producing well-rounded multicultural superheroes was totally overlooked. This goes for the associated book as well. It's a fine documentary..but, not deserving of so many stars. NOW. What could be pretty amazing PBS. Why don't you get Ken Burns to do a serious piece on the ENTIRE history of the medium of comics in American. Now THAT could be something!! Don't' you think???",1385856000,,953,4.746987951807229
