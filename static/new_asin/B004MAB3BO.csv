8435858,2,B004MAB3BO,"This movie is described as 96 minutes long and digitally remastered.  But when played, it's only 85 minutes.  And the picture is the same, public domain quality featured by other disc pirates.  The two stars are because I actually do like this movie.  It just seems impossible to buy a DVD of it other than the edited, American TV print.",1484179200,,337,4.566666666666666
8435859,1,B004MAB3BO,"All of Peter Lupus sword-and-sandal films have been available through cheap public domain releases for years now, with HERCULES AND THE TYRANTS OF BABYLON being the easiest to find. I was thrilled when I read that this 2014 release from FilmRise had been digitally remastered as the cheap cover art boasts. Since I have seen a gorgeous European print on You T*be, I could not wait to get this in all its restored glory.

What an outright lie and ridiculous case of false advertising on the part of FilmRise! This is still the same ragged, faded, cropped print that has been used for all the cheap various releases thus far. I posted some screen grabs to compare the difference and bear in mind, the restored pics are only from You T*be so you imagine how great this would look on an actual Blu-Ray or DVD. Amazon needs to remove this listing.",1466985600,,842,4.576158940397351
8435860,4,B004MAB3BO,"Based on the Bible, the Old Testament, the Jewish people is taken up to Babylon as slaves but Hercules (Peter Lupus) is going to put things right fighting against three evil brothers that command in Babylon  and the king of Asiria. The film is very amusing, Peter Lupus gives blows, throws big stones against enemies and finally destroys the city with the help of a big weel connected with chains to the basement of the main buildings. Each of the 4 tyrants will find death in a deserved and different way. But I am sorry the copy of the movie is as old as the hills.",1400457600,,567,4.349056603773585
8435861,3,B004MAB3BO,"Fair sword-and-sandal film from Italy in the sixties.  Hercules has to right wrongs and bring down the tyrants, a sister and two brothers act.  Yes, that's Peter Lupus from the Mission: Impossible TV series.  I ordered the AFA Productions DVD  though a seller on Amazon.  It arrived in a timely manner, but the DVD was loose in the case and was scratched up.  It probably happened during transit.  My recommendation is that sellers pack their products more securely.  Thankfully the DVD played just fine.  OK for fans of the genre.",1385337600,,531,4.811111111111111
8435862,3,B004MAB3BO,"Given the year of production and the excellant actors, the cast, this movie was just what I was hoping to get, what I expected.  I was quite satified. The only negative feedback I have is technical.  The movie DVD I recieved in the mail played okay on DVD player and on computer DVD bbut the computer indicated that it was not properly mastered.  DVD manufacturer please take note.",1359849600,,381,4.573529411764706
8435863,3,B004MAB3BO,"The Babylonians are upset because capture of slaves beyond their frontiers is getting difficult.  Some guy named Hercules is the apparent troublemaker.  Salman Osar, one of the three rulers of Babylon, orders his army to cross the river into the hinterland to capture slaves at all costs.  The army captures slaves and is bringing them back when Hercules interrupts again and saves the slaves.

After Hercules (played by Peter Lupus under the name Rock Stevens; Lupus was soon to go on to greater fame as one of the only two cast members to be on the television show ""Mission: Impossible"" during its entire run) frees the slaves, we learn that Hercules just returned from a long journey.  After his return, he discovered that the Babylonians have captured all the women of his country, including the one who cares for the most, Queen Asparia.  We now have the plot for the rest of the movie.

We switch over to Queen Asparia, where we find that the slaves have been keeping a pet bird in a cage hidden from their guards.  I found their ability to hide the bird humorous because the cage was so large.  Queen Asparia sends the bird and the slave to find Hercules.  The thought is that the bird will be sent back to the slaves to let them know that Hercules is on his way.

Things get complicated at this point.  The king of Assyria tries to buy all the slaves in Babylon because he knows that Queen Asparia is among them.  The king of Assyria also enlists the aid of Hercules to retrieve Queen Asparia.  Of course, Hercules already planned to rescue Queen Asparia, so the temporary alliance with the king of Assyria just gave Hercules some additional help and helped Hercules figure out what the King of Assyria planned.

Earlier I mentioned the three rulers of Babylon.  In addition to scheming against other kingdoms, the trio schemes against each other.  Thus, we have the king of Assyria, the three rulers of Babylon, Hercules and even Queen Asparia all working plots and schemes.

Eventually the plotting and the scheming needs wrapped up, and in the exciting final scenes, all the loose ends are tied up neatly.  I leave it to a viewer to learn how things shake out.

Peter Lupus made a decent Hercules.  Lupus was a body builder in the 1950s and 60s, competing and winning professionally.  In many ways, he was similar to Arnold Schwarzenegar, powerfully built, strong, and a man of few words.  A number of Lupus's early roles were similar types of characters, and Lupus played them well.  It may be that these roles brought him to the attention of the producers of ""Mission: Impossible.""

The movie is quite well done.  The plotting, while complex, is reasonably easy to follow.  The sets are generally adequate until we see a scene near the end that is reminiscent of a scene in Arnold Schwarzenegar's ""Conan the Barbarian.""  The scene involves a giant winch that spools chains that cause the collapse of Babylon.  The special effects are the best in the entire movie and are very well done.

I have one complaint about this movie, and that is the quality of the video.  There seems to be little interest in restoring this movie because it is in the public domain.  It appears that without copyright, there is insufficient incentive to restore these old movies to the best quality possible with modern technology.  Perhaps one day such restorations will be inexpensive enough to make it worthwhile.  The sound is also deteriorated on this film with occasional muddy spots, but the sound is generally good enough to understand what is happening.

This movie is one of 19 Italian-made Hercules movies from the 1950's and 1960's.  While the gold standard actor from these films was the late Steve Reeves, who appeared in the first two Hercules movies, a number of these movies were adequate and enjoyable.  I count this movie as one of those, making it an above average Hercules movie from this era.

Enjoy!",1340150400,,3912,4.723781388478582
8435864,4,B004MAB3BO,I first saw this when it came out (released by 20th Century-Fox). It then disappeared. An unusual story with some excellent talent and a great director. The transfer is disappointing however the film itself overcomes that.,1122422400,,222,5.194444444444445
