3646519,2,B001I9KE7Q,"This was made right before the 2012 election and you can tell the program is not trying to be partisan.  However, if you like surprise endings, then real life will tell you the conclusion before you watch so much as one minute.  I think the point of this work is to provide voters with biological facts about the then candidates.  They make many a parallel, in a way.  The work starts with elections that both men lost.  It shows the impact of absent or present fathers on both men.  It says neither man had things as easy as they expected before they were elected.  Reverend Jesse Jackson is interviewed for this program and the word ""nuts"" never comes up.  What's shocking is that you see a young Obama with other biracial youth and at one point the chalkboard says something like ""proud mixed-race youth"" and then in the next photo it says something like ""confused youth of the future.""  They mention that teen Obama liked a product that Cypress Hill does.  (However, it says nothing about Bush, Jr.s taste for a certain substance.)  Most importantly, it never mentions that Romney called 42% of Americans a cutdown.  Nothing is said about vice presidential candidates either.",1412208000,,1179,4.7254901960784315

3646521,3,B001I9KE7Q,"From the jump, this work says it was a PBS show on October 14, 2008, aka a few weeks before the 2008 elections.  Imagine watching ""Return of the Jedi"" but not seeing when Darth Vader destroys the Emperor.  What if you saw ""Titanic"" and didn't learn what happened to the Heart of the Ocean?  That is how this work feels; it's like a body with its head cut off.
They don't really speak about the 2008 election until the second hour of the work.  The first explores the candidates' biographies.  You see photos of Obama at Harvard Law.  You see McCain as a POW.  We also learn that McCain has dark chest hair, much different from Obama who is smooth.  The Keating Five, Reverend Wright, and other highlights come up.
Still, I would have done this differently.  To me, Sarah Palin played a significant, and some would say polarizing, role in the election, but she is only mentioned here briefly and at the tail end of the work.  Obama made a speech about race, but this work says nothing about Romney's speech on religion, which was important.  Actually, the other candidates besides Hillary Clinton barely come up at all.  The issue of McCain's age is not mentioned here, when I'd say it was a factor that voters pondered.
In short, this work was meant to help voters decide what they would do in November of 2008.  Well, that was months ago and we know who the winner of the contest was.  (Hip-hop hooray!, in my opinion)  So this will feel dated even if it was well made for its first airing.",1234137600,,1491,4.450184501845018

8310529,5,B001I9KE7Q,"I think what has consistently impressed me the most about Frontline documentaries by Michael Kirk, who also did Divided States of America about the key events of the Obama administration, is how his documentaries cover so much territory with a limited amount of time, but also provide depth with surprising anecdotes.  I did my research about Trump's sordid background when he was gaining headway as a candidate, but most voters did not.  What this documentary does not cover is any possible trajectory toward becoming less self-centered and how his views shifted toward evangelical Christianity--but Trump himself never explained that trajectory, either.  I learned a lot I did not know about Hillary Clinton.  For example, she was in the same class at Yale Law School as Clarence Thomas, who became a conservative Supreme Court justice.  And she was planning a Senate run at the very same moment Bill Clinton was apologizing to the nation for his Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.  It really has a lot of insight into the personalities of the two candidates.

I strongly recommend this documentary for covering so much territory and informing people about the backgrounds of the candidates in a truly honest way.",1499472000,,1209,5.106598984771574
8310530,2,B001I9KE7Q,"1st, this is a very low quality DVD, they must have used a low bit rate when authoring as the quality is so much lower than what you can watch for free on Youtube or download for a couple of bucks on iTunes, it's just a cheaply made DVD period you will notice when the early titles run.

The program is pretty pathetic as well.  Writers of books on Trump who do not like him and also have written books lauding President Obama (Michael D'Antonio who wrote Obama A Consequential President ) are primary sources so if you are expecting a non biased and close to an even handed documentary from a once proud name Frontline, buckle up for a bad ride.

I can't recommend this to anybody who truly wants to be educated to the events of the 2016 Presidential election to be sure. If you want an inside view into the Trump campaign the book by Pollak ; How Trump Won, is excellent.  There are dozens of recent and excellent books about Hillary from Daniel Halper' Clinton Inc,  to Peter Schweizer's Clinton Cash that put the recent efforts of camp Clinton into focus.",1489017600,,1059,4.410256410256411

8310532,5,B001I9KE7Q,This examines the lives of the two main candidates for President of the United States for 2016. Shares their childhoods with photos and interviews of people that know them and later includes actual footage of them talking. Insightful.

8310533,5,B001I9KE7Q,"A very interesting insight into both TRUMP and CLINTON.
Both are not dissimilar really both want POWER. Clinton sold out in my estimation by not going it alone and teaming up with Bill who held her back. Today of she had not had the name Clinton who knows she is smart enough to have gone as far as she could but she appears to have sold out. AND that footage where she says she is not Tammy Wynette Standing by her man is exactly what she did do. If she had true guts she would have no needed a sidekick and this is appears to be a Political marriage of convenience. Quite two faced and for some reason the general public do not like her and never will. She is now part of the establishment she opposed as a young Woman.
As for TRUMP it reveals his true nature and we all have to make our own assessments of him ourselves. America is pinning great hope  on one Man as they did the first black president who became a disappointment so only history will tell. The early signs are not that good. He must learn to be a diplomat not a bully first and foremost.",1486684800,2,1056,4.151219512195122

8310535,4,B001I9KE7Q,"I watched on Frontline, how unfortunate it will not be released until Dec. well after the election.
With all the content on Trump my guess is he filed suit to stop it's release until this election was over.
I am still buying DVD to share with friends and family.",1478822400,2,262,4.36734693877551
