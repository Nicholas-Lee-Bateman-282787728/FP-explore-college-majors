8211583,2,B000TZN7LK,"I own and enjoy all of the Negativland recordings, and have seen them live on a number of occasions. ""I want a piece of toast!"" But this DVD is a disappointment. A large disappointment. There's just not much anything here. The visuals are less than inspired, and are generally less ""experimental"" than the typical no-budget 1980s music video. Honestly I thought that the visuals detracted only from the music, but would be willing, in the best of worlds, to say that they were merely inessential.

I'm giving this two stars in generosity to Negativland and perhaps a willingness to call this a noble, but failed, experiment.",1236470400,3,624,4.886792452830188
8211584,5,B000TZN7LK,This was the single best thing that Santa brought me this Christmas! No fan of Negativland or multi-media art in general should be without this. This is a truly monumental work that you can not put a price on. I had an orgasm watching the Weatherman clean his shoes before entering his house to give us a tour of where all his world famous home recordings were made. You will too! Get out your cash and BUY!!,1199491200,3,408,4.311688311688312
