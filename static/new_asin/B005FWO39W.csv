8470727,3,B005FWO39W,"I'm not finished going through this full set of DVDs yet - after all there are almost 17 hours worth! - but I've got a pretty good idea of the content by selecting a few discs based on the printed index booklet enclosed in this six DVD set.

I see all the five-star reviews posted here and can't quite understand them, but I'll you my take here. First off, I will say that you get a lot of ""video for your buck"" though you will give up 17 hours of your life if you watch the full set once. There are 39 25-minute shows here.

I don't know much about the series - which originally aired on some Public TV stations around the country in 2000 - and was co-produced and hosted by - as the package states ""songwriter and recording artist Laurie Roth"". Roth is now best known as a Conservative talk show host on the USA Network and, on her radio show home page, she refers to herself as ""The Annie Oakley of the Airwaves"". There's even a ""Laurie Roth For President 2012"" website! I can tell you that this was a syndicated show offered to Public TV stations, but it was not produced by PBS itself.

Each show has Roth traveling around the country looking for all styles of live music - in bars, theaters and casinos. Each show features 1-3 different artists. About half are well known (Rita Coolidge, Lou Rawls  -a name that immediately told me that this series was not new as he died in January 2006 - Raul Revere and the Raiders,Jethro Tull, Billy Ray Cyrus) and half who will be new to you - they were to me - like David Jackson, The Dusty 45s, Donna DeLory & Bliss, and Little Sister Soul. Oh yes, I forgot, you get Roth, herself, singing on Program 23. Roth interviews each artist before and during the performance. Yes, DURING the performance. Many of the performances are either excerpts or are cut short before the song is finished! I found this quite frustrating and I'm surprised the other reviewers didn't. Again, I haven't watch all the shows but the three I've watched so far had this issue. The DVDs are indexed by chapters to get you to a song, but you'll also have to watch Roth's comments again.

It's interesting that there are no end credits on any of the shows - at least on the ones I've watched, so I don't know where this series was actually produced.

The list of artists that I've still to watch - The Wailers, The Temptations, Chuck Mangione, Kathy Mattea - are folks I love to watch. But, assuming those shows are as edited as what I've seen so far, there will be only partial songs performed.

So if, like the previous reviewers who said they remember these shows as they aired a decade or more ago, you want to recapture the moments you remember, by all means check out the set. But, if you want to see full performances (and by the way, these are in standard screen format) know, going in that you won't find many.

I hope that you found this review both informative and helpful.

8470728,5,B005FWO39W,"I used to watch this all the time on PBS.  It's a rare treasure.  What a surprise to find it here on Amazon. The show with Blondie is the best...but I digress, either that or I'm showing my age. Just saw Debbie Harry in concert. lol. Buy it, trust me!! You'll wear out all the DVDs....",1324425600,,285,4.071428571428571
8470729,5,B005FWO39W,"So happy to see CD Highway fianlly available for purchase!  I enjoyed it so much when it ran on T.V. - such a wonderful collection of musical talent.  I always felt like I'd spent an afternoon of beer driking and guitar pickin' on the porch with the artist after an episode.  Excited to add it to my permanent collection.  Also, makes a great gift!",1315872000,2,348,4.390625
8470730,5,B005FWO39W,"As an artist, I have found the CD Highway shows to be a unique way of presenting an artist.  In today's pop culture, there is very little opportunity left to see a performer as both a human and an artist - so much time is devoted to proper packaging, staging and the editing of the artist that their reality is as dissolute as ""reality TV"" itself.  CD Highway was one of the rare programs that defied the plastic logic of twenty-first century entertainment showcasing.  Goodbye MTV.  Hello CD Highway.",1315440000,2,501,4.595505617977528
8470731,5,B005FWO39W,"So happy that CD Highway is finally being released on DVD! This show introduced me to so many amazing artists, both famous and obscure, including some of my all-time favorites. The performances are very up-close and personal, so it's a real treat for any live music fan. And as a musician myself, when I was first starting out, it gave me a valuable insight into the life of a professional musician. I highly recommend this show for anyone who enjoys music, or wants to learn more about some of their favorite artists. Definitely picking up a few sets for Christmas presents this year.",1315267200,6,585,4.689320388349515
8470732,5,B005FWO39W,I have seen most of the episodes of CD Highway and find it very entertaining. I have recommended this program to all of my music loving friends.  CD Highway ROCKS!,1314835200,4,163,4.433333333333334
