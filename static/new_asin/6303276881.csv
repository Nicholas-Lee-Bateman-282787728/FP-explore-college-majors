615321,3,6303276881,"Although I love Candy in every film I have seen him in, I was disappointed in this one.... it is slow, looks like it had rewrites along the way, possibly due to his death, but good for a few chuckles along the way. The characters, except for the two leads, are very good and really shine. But Candy is weak in his role, leaving much of his talent by the wayside... again maybe because of his death and scene cutting. I never cared for Richard Lewis and he is just as weak as Candy in this film. The price is right and the editing, photography, and supporting cast make it a worthwhile purchase. The film was poorly written, but comes out as a C+ film overall on DVD.",1073606400,7,666,4.2109375
615322,3,6303276881,"I've heard that any movie in which the star dies during filming will be ""jinxed""; that is, people will lambaste it.  ""Wagons East"" is a perfect example of this phenomenon.  I'm not sure why I decided to watch this film after all I'd heard about it...but, for some reason, I did.

And what did I find?  Not a horrible movie...but what *could* have actually been a *good* movie (among other things, it's based on actual events-settlers *did* often decide to return east), made mediocre by the fact that the footage filmed after John Candy's death was so easy to spot.  And some of the anachronistic humor (including the very presence of the Richard Lewis character), admittedly, did not help.

But there were quite a few good laughs.  The gay guy turning out to be a masterful gunslinger comes to mind.  And the scuzzy Ferguson brothers (even the most distinctive of them made unrecognizable by blank expressions and layers of filth) were hilarious.",1038873600,,947,4.802469135802469
615323,4,6303276881,"...This is one funny movie. This is not a movie where a sterling acting performance convinces you that an actor is a different person, or where some fundamental truth aboot human nature is revealed. This is a movie where you laugh your [head] off because of dialog about moccasins, quitters, and big. . . fat. . . books. And if the scene with the insanely effiminate bookstore owner is revealed to be a hardcore bad [dude] doesn't just slay you then you have deep issues.

615478,5,6303276881,"I received the DVD a few days after I placed the order.  Once I started watching, the movie froze in one place; but with some effort I managed to coax it past that point.  The movie is hilarious, with a lot of hidden humor that you might miss if you're not paying close attention.  Even though I was paying attention, I look forward to watching the movie multiple times to make sure I caught all the jokes.  Also, a knowledge of the Donner Party tragedy (winter of 1846-1847) is necessary to fully appreciate the humor in the second half of movie.  This movie did not receive good reviews when it was originally produced years ago, but apparently the critics who gave it low marks did not have a sense of humor.  I consider the movie to be a John Candy classic film.",1487635200,,766,4.359154929577465

They decide to go back east, but to do this they will need a skilled and knowledgeable wagon master. Who should stumble in but the best wagon master in the west, James H. Harlow (John Candy). Naturally there is a money grubbing cabal apposed to this move and they will stop at nothing to throat the ""Wagons East"" plan.

Well designed with a select group of actors that never overplayed their parts. The consumes and scenes here exceptionally good for the comedy. The Indians look like Indians and the floozies look floozy. The film is jam packed with one liners.",1485043200,,678,4.557377049180328

615558,5,6303276881,"Jad Fair and Daniel Johnston's song about the feeling you get when you're watching a film and you realize the people in it have passed away perfectly expresses the spookiness one can experience watching this film. We lost John Candy in 1994 during the filming of ""Wagons East.""  His character comes and goes almost like a ghost due to continuity issues from being unable to finish filming. At the same time, the villain is a cartoonish immortal (and Hollywood's first steampunk?) who doesn't suffer too badly when he falls from a cliff in a self-induced rockslide. How's a viewer to reconcile that?  It gets weirder: Richard Lewis is actually funny in this film! Five stars for being unlike anything before or since.",1472774400,,716,4.860655737704918

The problem is not the movie itself but the release, it miss Spanish subtitles or be dubbed to Another language, therefore it says it is. I got it last night and really wanted to see it in Spanish with my family. It was jus not possible. I love the movie but I hate it has not the features it says like dubbed languages or subtitles (He would have been happy just with subtitles)

Well since Amazon has all these PRIME movies, all I have to do is think up one of those goodies from the past .. push the button, and I'm off to the eighties or where ever. I love it!

In this eighties classic: For a group of disgruntled easterners living in the era of ""The great Western Expansion"" of the 1800's, whom have moved their family's west from the (at the time) relatively civilized and settled east cost....Well, the Ol' West just wasn't meant for everyone. To these meek folks, all the rough living, with all the Indian infested, Cowboy, rootin-tootin, shoot 'em up, has finally grown far too tiresome for a school teacher, a doctor, a shocked and horrified Mail Order Bride, a professional..er..prostitute, a gay librarian, and a whole wagon train of disenchanted easterners. So, they hire a Wagon Master played by the late John Candy (this was his last film unfortunately) to hustle them back east where they should have stayed...where they belonged in the first place; in the City.  So, St. Louise bound they go; causing a ripple effect that is truly  hilarious to watch! Great movie! Great  ""family night"" movie!",1401408000,2,1228,4.741784037558685

This film production represents a fitting tribute to Candy, who died while it was being filmed.  I think it is a classic, ranking right up there with 'Cat Ballou' as something worth seeing.

(though I couldn't always remember where).  Prominent of course are John Candy
as the ""Wagon Master"", and Richard Lewis as one of the disgusted settlers who
have thrown in the towel (if they still had one) and decided to go back East where
they belong.  In other words: this is a comedy.  But it is not a guffaw out loud
comedy; there is not a lot of potty humor or crude language and no nudity (though
sexual innuendos are scattered about often enough).  Richard Lewis has one scene
in which it looks like he's going to do a portion of one of his stand-up acts but he
doesn't (maybe that's supposed to be some of the subtle humor).  John Candy started
out looking completely unrecognizable both visually and by voice; it was only when
the camera panned up close on his face (and his voice started to become more
natural) that he was recognizable.  The DVD version is dedicated to his memory.

Action being second in this movie, now for some clues some people want to return to the east because of the west being untamed, Now the Indians go on the warpath and attack the wagon train in the middle of their camp, the wagon master puts them there by error while trying to hide from them. The Indians think its a good idea for the settlers to go back so that others will follow and escort them back, that's so they don't get lost of cause and they must have a few problems here and there to keep it spiced up. Story is terrific and a great sense of humor to go with it puts it as number one in my books. So get the movie and enjoy a fabulous night at home and be entertained with the snacks while watching an unforgettable first class comedy.",1364169600,,1022,4.11

The premise is really funny, as is the film, but not hilarious. Sadly, this was John Candy's last movie. He died during filming of a heart attack. He's good in this but John C McGinley (Perry on the TV show ""Scrubs"") is the real star of this movie as the gay, very proper, espresso-serving bookstore owner completely out of place in a tiny western town. His reaction to the retarded hillbilly wanting a ""big, damn book"" is priceless. I've seen it a few times and would watch it again.",1362873600,,628,4.616071428571429

616105,4,6303276881,"A group of very modern, civilized, citified pioneers who came to the Wild West to start a new life soon find they are sick of the hardships and rustic company, so much so that they make plans to head back East, something that is simply not done. When their wagon train is off and running, the railroad bigwigs get wind of this new, Eastward ""movement"" and decide to put a stop to it. A hired killer is sent out to thwart their journey, as if the weather, terrain, and Indians weren't enough. On top of that, there is concern that the often drunk wagon master may have been the same one who led the ill-fated Donner Party to their unfortunate circumstance several years prior!

When it was released in 1994, the year of star John Candy's death, ""Wagons East!"" was not well received. Why people can't enjoy a silly comedy like this now and then, I really don't know. Candy and co-star Richard Lewis lead a very funny cast of characters who end up in many humorous situations, all the while unaware that they are being unsuccessfully attacked by a Wile E. Coyote style villain sent by a greedy railroad tycoon who even has the U.S. Cavalry in his pocket. It's a silly film, and it's certainly not the greatest, some of the jokes even fall flat, but for the most part it is very funny and lots of fun! Well worth spending a night with, and maybe following up with a viewing of ""Almost Heroes"".

The problem with this DVD is, therefore, not the film, but the presentation itself. Here we only get a fullscreen presentation that must be exactly the same as the VHS was (not a very good print), and with zero bonus features. There's really nothing good that can be said about it. Here's hoping a Blu-Ray does the film better one day. In the meantime, this DVD of ""Wagons East!"" is all we get, so check it out if you get the chance. The film is not as bad as it's been treated.",1326412800,8,1869,4.367816091954023
616106,5,6303276881,"When John Candy died while making this film it was a real loss to the world.  Not only was he a giant of a man physically but his innate warmth made him a giant of a person.  This film was given haphazard promotion and kind of dumped into the marketplace in the Summer of 1994.  The pain of losing Candy was so great that fans were not eager to see this movie.  Some seventeen years later the sting is still there.  You cannot view this film without a tinge of sadness.  I will not bandy words.  This is not a fitting epitaph for Candy's career.  It's obvious that his filming was incomplete.  Scenes where he was obviously intended to be in are written around his absence.  Body doubles and long shots are generously employed.  That said I found this film terrifically funny.  It seems that the makers of the film brushed away their tears and decided to put their best effort forth.  Yes, Candy isn't omnipresent but in his stead there's terrific work by esteemed actors like Richard Lewis, John C. McGinley, and Robert Pichardo.  What greater gift than giving your best for a fallen comrade.  A generation later the pain has abated somewhat and you can view ""Wagons East"" for what it truly is, a fitting tribute to one of the legends of the silver screen.",1297987200,3,1257,4.475770925110132

616171,2,6303276881,"WAGONS EAST was a sad epitaph to John Candy's career.  The plot is good, but the screenplay is terrible.  Sadly, Candy passed away during the last two weeks of filming.  At the time the film company announced that Candy's scenes were already completed and in the can, but the reality is that John Candy is inexplicably missing from a couple of scenes.  His absence is most notable in the ""Snow in Summertime"" scene.  A padded stand-in wearing Candy's buckskins is seen sauntering away in the background, but John Candy is nowhere to be seen at the critical fireplace dialogue.

Filmed in Mexico, WAGONS EAST is a BLAZING SADDLES wanna-be.  Instead it looks more like a low-budget television movie.  Actor Ed Lauter plays the bad guy.  Unfortunately, his stereotypical character is almost a rip-off of Kirk Douglas' accident prone heavy in 1979's comedy THE VILLAIN.  Lauter has been in television and movies a long time.  He appeared in both versions of THE LONGEST YARD. He could have found a better cinematic vehicle than this.

The story is simply this:  The residents of a lackluster western town decide that it was a mistake to ever move west.  They hire John Candy to lead them back east.  Unfortunately, the publicity generated by this eastward march causes influential land speculators to panic.  As such, they attempt to foil returning settlers plans by sending a professional bad guy to intercept them.

Much as I enjoy John Candy movies, this one is a disappointment.  I cannot even say that it was good to see Candy on the big screen again as he appeared to be laboring through each scene.  In Candy's last two films, CANADIAN BACON and WAGON'S EAST, he sported a scraggily beard.  This was not the same energetic John Candy from STRIPES, BREWSTER'S MILLIONS, SPLASH, UNCLE BUCK, PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES, ONLY THE LONELY, or SUMMER RENTAL.

Okay, enough bashing the film.  The DVD is very affordable and if you are a John Candy fan, then this should probably find its way into your movie collection.  It is just a shame that Candy's last film was this one.",1140652800,2,2073,4.793785310734464

7842441,4,6303276881,"RELEASED IN 1994 and directed by Peter Markle, ""Wagons East"" details events when a dozen settlers in the remote Southwest town of Prosperity give up on the West and hire a drunken wagon master (John Candy) to lead them back East. Later, some Sioux tribespeople decide to assist them, hoping it will become a trend. Meanwhile, a dastardly villain (Edward Matthew Lauter) is hired by a railroad mogul to stop the small wagon train  la Wile E. Coyote in The Road Runner.

If you like comedy Westerns like Texas Across the River (1966) and The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox (1976), you should like this one as well. It mixes laugh-out-loud scenes with quietly amusing ones. I think its superior to the overrated Cat Ballou (1965) and even better than the heralded Blazing Saddles (1974). Its not intentionally offensive like the latter, although theres a little black humor. In some ways its kinda cute and heartwarming (e.g. the relationship between the big guy and the former prostitute). The locations are spectacular.

There are several familiar faces in the cast who were popular around that time, e.g. Richard Lewis, John C. McGinley, Robert Picardo, Ellen Greene, Melinda Culea, William Sanderson, Rodney A. Grant and Russell Means.
