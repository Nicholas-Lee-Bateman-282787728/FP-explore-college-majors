8415961,5,B004478YIU,"I used this tutorial to learn to read and interpret schematics and found it very helpful. Unlike the person, who gave it a low rating, I found that this tutorial requires the learner to participate by being hands-on and doing some actual work as part of the learning process. This was a great way for me to personally learn the symbols. I've found that during recent interviews I've had for maintenance positions at hospitals, knowing the schematics basics is helping me to my second interview where before I mastered this tutorial, if I didn't have knowledge of how to read schematics, I wasn't even getting to a second interview in the hiring process. I highly recommend this tutorial for anyone who wants to get their foot in the door in the electrical, HVAC,maintenance industries, as well as those who service and repair electromechanical equipment to get this tutorial and learn it, and then keep moving ahead by learning other schematic diagrams. Knowledge is Power!",1325116800,,973,4.939024390243903
8415962,1,B004478YIU,"Purchased dvd 12-31-10. I am a HVAC-R student looking for electrical schematics tutorial and even though I though dvd price was excessive, I purchased. I watched and was very disappointed in very brief contant and the way tutorial was set up. I get more information from 1/2 of 1 chapter in my text. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this dvd and if you want more info about HVAC-R wiring to purchase a used text book for a few dollars. I would rate this dvd less than one star if I could.",1294790400,4,495,4.391304347826087
