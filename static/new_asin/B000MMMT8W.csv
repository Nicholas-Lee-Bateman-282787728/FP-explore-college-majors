2737051,5,B000MMMT8W,"The Country Mouse and City Mouse movies are wonderful for kids and adults alike!  There were originally 52 episodes that aired on PBS in 1998-1999, but we didn't discover them until years later when we picked up a VHS tape at a yard sale, thinking our out-of-state grandchildren might enjoy it when they visited.  They did and the rest is history:  we've collected all 34 episodes that are available for purchase in VHS and DVD format and are sad that the remaining 18 episodes were apparently never released.  In the meantime, we enjoy watching these stories every time the kids come to visit; they are now 11 and 9 and still love them!",1364515200,3,637,4.610619469026549
2737052,5,B000MMMT8W,This series is one of my grandsons' favorites.  It is a real blessing to have some of them on DVD so they don't require so much room.  Thank you.,1357430400,,145,3.9655172413793105
2737053,5,B000MMMT8W,"I ordered this for my 4 year old who loved them! They are a fun and clean adventure movie for kids of all ages, even as adults my husband and I enjoyed watching them with our daughter. I highly recommend this movie, not only was it good but this is a great value for your buck as well!",1349568000,,285,3.9310344827586206
2737054,5,B000MMMT8W,"Our children absolutely enjoyed this delightful movie (well it is more of a collection of episodes, than a movie).

2737056,4,B000MMMT8W,"My 2.5yr old love these ""mouse cartoons"", he probably doesn't understand half of what's going on, but he still love to watch them over and over again. The cartoon drawings are very simple, but the stories are interesting.

I'm not really sure what it is he likes so much about them, one thing he does get excited over is the cats chasing the mice, there's plenty of that going on.

Even if I'm not too crazy about these cartoons (they're a little bit silly), I am glad my son likes them because they're pretty wholesome imo.

We have 2 more of these ""Country mouse..."" DVD's, the other two had a ""play all"" button which is missing in my copy of this DVD, too bad because I think this one is the best of the three.",1247529600,4,713,4.266666666666667
