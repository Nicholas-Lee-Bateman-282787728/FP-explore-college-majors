""Varieties on Parade"" (1951, 57 min)
It's vaudeville on film as the camera passes a box office and ticket taker, proceeds to a front-row seat, and watches as master of ceremonies. Jackie Coogan comes out on stage to introduce singers, dancers, acrobats, jugglers, cyclists--even a skit spoofing the silent film ""The Kid"" which made Coogan a famous child star! --- Featuring Jackie ""The Kid"" Coogan, Eddie Garr M.C., Tom Neal, Eddie Dean (Had his own Singing Cowboy Film Series), Iris Adrian and Lyle Talbot.
