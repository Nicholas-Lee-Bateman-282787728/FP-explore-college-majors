8503625,5,B000A1EAMS,Best docudrama film I've even seen. It's a very good educational and teaching tools for those who are engaged in tanker shipping businesses. One can find out the red-tape between the government and oil companies which prevented the successful operation to carry out the oil pollution cleanup. I still have an original DVD with region 4 but can't decide on the value to share with others.,1529971200,,387,4.878787878787879
