8188839,5,B000P4H7XE,"I was gonna buy this from Mopix, but when i bought the other download from them, it was such a hassle. Plus when I emailed them to tell them I can't get it to work, the customer service wrote: ""You read the FAQ"" He also told me that he ""is not a mind reader"". So I came to Amazon. It was quick, it was easy. And they were nice. So I am happy. Video was great. Anyone who is learning ATS should have it because it is like a catalogue for basic ATS moves.",1371081600,2,453,3.8297872340425534

This DVD gave me detailed reference, and a better feel for where the style was coming from. At first I thought it was a little pricey, but now I feel it was well worth it.",1274572800,6,283,4.163636363636364
