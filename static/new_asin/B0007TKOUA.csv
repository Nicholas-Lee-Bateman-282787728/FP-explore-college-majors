2241853,5,B0007TKOUA,"I'm happy with this purchase and gave it as a Christmas Gift for my Nephew.  I couldn't help but notice much improvement in his playing as he play's and practice's frequently.  The only problem was with the expedited shipping which was credited back to my account and was acceptable because I did get the gift in time for Christmas Eve, but it was a close one.  Make sure you allow extra time for shipping even if you choose the 'expedited' shipping option.  The seller uses a different shipping company that doesn't really do expedited shipping compared to other more well know services.  This can be quite costly in other ways!  Otherwise, the product is great and I highly recommend it!",1333756800,,689,4.7
2241854,5,B0007TKOUA,"A little premature on the review because I only gave it a cursory look over when it arrived. Haven't gotten around to it yet. Still working on my other two DVD's.
However, it is a great value, comes with booklet with chord chart, tabs, etc and has free web support and practice tracks. I recommend.",1289952000,2,298,4.4363636363636365

8051461,5,B0007TKOUA,"John McCarthy is a very calm and enjoyable person to learn from! He makes it clear that practice is key, and takes his time showing the student (you) everything you would need to start playing the electric guitar. I have personally picked up some useful skills from this particular DVD on my journey, and would recommend anyone to start here if they wish to play. Great price for the educational value!

An honest and unpaid review,
