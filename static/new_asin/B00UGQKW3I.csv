8706759,3,B00UGQKW3I,"1934's UPPERWORLD has finally been released on DVD by Warner Archive.  The lead actor, Warren William, has been undergoing a long overdue renaissance, with a great new biography finally available (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-William-Magnificent-Scoundrel-of-Pre-Code-Hollywood/dp/0786448784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren William: Magnificent Scoundrel of Pre-Code Hollywood</a>), along with numerous DVD's.  Unfortunately the picture quality is lousy, one of the worst I've seen yet, with scratches and speckles galore, which is sadly the case with most Warner Archive Pre-Code releases.  There have been great advances in film restoration, many films can now be cleaned chemically or by using ultrasound. Scratches and other imperfections can sometimes be removed through several techniques such as the wet-gate process, in which a damaged film is immersed in fluid before light is passed through it. The fluid helps fill in the gashes, which then do not print through to the copy.  These techniques aren't expensive, Warner Archive is just cheap.  For all the money they will make off an un-restored film transfer, released on a cheap DVD-R, they should be ashamed.  UPPERWORLD does feature a great cast, Mary Astor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MALTESE-FALCON/dp/B003ZEQMH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MALTESE FALCON</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MEET-ME-IN-ST-LOUIS/dp/B00005JKGZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MEET ME IN ST.

The plot revolves around a wealthy railroad magnate (William) whose wife (Astor) is always too busy to spend time with him, and who doesn't get to spend enough time with his son (Moore).  Fate intervenes when he rescues a drowning night club performer (Rogers) with his yacht.  Devine is his comic relief chauffeur and Naish is the jealous boyfriend.  Blackmail, murder and a vengeful beat cop (Toler) spice up the film, whose virtues lie with the superb cast.  The tycoon's eventual fate shows how little things have changed since the Depression.
