3156132,4,B0016GONA0,Saif Ali Khan's good looks dominated the film.. luminously handsome.  No one was pretending to make this realistic... just having a good time..  and I really liked the 'dance in the rain' at the end.,1289174400,,199,4.6571428571428575
3156133,4,B0016GONA0,"This is similar to the plot of 'Sabrina'. Forthright and coquettish Daughter (Kajol)of driver of rich family has crush on playboy wastrel son of family (Saif Ali Khan). She isn't noticed or accepted because of her 'station' in life. She goes to Mumbai and is transformed into a top model and returns. Playboy falls for her but upsets her and she heads back to Mumbai. Then she meets Playboy's serious quiet businessman brother (Akshay Kumar) and they fall for each other. Meanwhile Playboy has decided he will change his ways and she is the love of his life...what now (particularly as tyrannical rich Mum won't accept such an alliance)?
This was a sustained entertainer. The actors are all strong and watchable. The music was fine and the dances even better. I particularly noticed the dances  - mostly more of a Hollywood jazz style- which pushed the male stars beyond their usual standard to some memorable and energetic dance in one or 2 numbers (look at Akshay do a dancing in the rain that Gene Kelly may even have enjoyed!)
No real negatives here- just solid enjoyment for lovers of Bollywood - and it isn't dated either even though it's 1994. Elsewhere on the Net it tends to rate a little above average mostly (e.g. 6 out of 10). A keeper. Recommended.",1242518400,3,1261,4.705882352941177

I am a fan of Kajol.
I was happy to order another of her movies.
This one I do not reccommend if you are not a Native Hindi speaker.
The subtitles are horrorable...they come late and worse of all the songs are not translated...as you know if you are a fan of Bollywood Films the songs are everything!
Video quality is low with this movie as well...
I wish I had better review for this movie since I really like Kajol.",1214697600,,436,4.2023809523809526
3156135,4,B0016GONA0,"Three and a half stars for YEH DILLAGI.

In the town of Shimla there lives a bold and high-spirited girl named Sapna (Kajol). Sapna's father toils as the lowly chauffer to the wealthy Saigal household, and yet she dares to dream beyond her alotted station in life. Her humble, loving father advises her that ""No matter how high the earth rises, it can never touch the moon."" But, ever since who knows, Sapna has been in love with Vikram, or ""Vicky"" (Saif Ali Khan), the younger scion of the powerful Saigal Industries. Vicky is an irresponsible skirt chaser, and Sapna enjoys torturing him by sabotaging his conquests. This finally lands her in trouble as an angered Vicky puts her and her father in their places. This causes Sapna's father to rip into her: ""You are an ordinary driver's daughter. And you will always be known as a driver's daughter."" Fighting words to Sapna, who vows to make something of herself.

She moves to Mumbai. There, she meets an advertising film director, and quickly becomes a successful model. Now a glamourous and sophisticated (but still very outspoken) young woman, Sapna one day decides to revisit Shimla, with Vicky still very much on her mind. And this is where the plot really starts going. Stranded on the roadside near her home, she is picked up by Vicky, who doesn't recognize her initially and is shocked when he finally does. This being a recipe to falling in love, Vicky soon does, with Sapna. But Vicky's mom doesn't approve of their relationship, feeling that Sapna is way beneath the Saigals' social standing. So it falls on the hardworking older son, Vijay (Akshay Kumar) to try to work things out...

But what are the odds that Vijay also succumbs to Sapna's charms? And, so, there's your romantic triangle.

YEH DILLAGI, two and a half hours long, is worth watching for Kajol's wonderful performance alone. Then throw in the two male leads, Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan - two of the most popular stars in Indian cinema today - and the film is elevated from decent to pretty good. Not great, mind you, because there are some dubious stuff here which could've been improved on. If this storyline seems at all familiar, then maybe it's because you've seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrina/dp/B00003CXCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrina</a>&nbsp;some time ago, a classic 1954 romantic comedy charmer which starred Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden.

Not to dump on this Bollywood cast, but how can they live up to that all-time stellar cast? No, they can't. Still, Saif Ali Khan as the wayward heir brings an urban and comedic charm to the role, and this is back in 1994, before his films became successful and Khan began to be recognized as an A-list actor. Akshay Kumar's character suffers from not being as detached and calculating as Bogart's Linus Larrabee. Even though his Vijay is so preoccupied with running the family business that he constantly peers at his watch, he is in essence already a nice, approachable guy. Therefore, his change of heart from obsessed workaholic to daydreaming romantic isn't as dramatic in contrast and, therefore, not as effective. Even more telling, I thought Akshay and Kajol would've ignited more of a spark. Again, I think it's more to do with Akshay's character being so bland...And Kajol? Well, she's predictably awesome. Even beyond her looks, there's her acting. I happen to believe that Kajol is the best actress in Bollywood - yes, even better than Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta. As with many of her film characters, I dare you not to fall in love with her. I double dare you.

And then there are the flaws. There's that nonsense about the Saigal patriarch being constantly harried by his stifling wife and having to sneak in his rich foods, his booze and his cigarettes. These scenes suck. Now, Bollywood flicks are typically inundated with musical numbers; no change here. But, unfortunately, this time, I didn't think much of the musical numbers, with the exception of the playful, rain-soaked ""Dekho Zara Dekho"" which nicely shows off Akshay Kumar's dancing skills, as well as being introduced by Kajol kissing Akshay (which probably sent ripples of shock throughout the Indian cinema audiences). Mumbai substitutes for eternally romantic Paris, except that one can't really replace Paris, could one? What else? There's that Bollywood conceit which surfaces so much in its pictures, the one where, out of the blue, the protagonist is suddenly able to beat up four or five thugs with ease. Yeah, that's here. An overwrought and sappy plot in the last half, that's here, too (although that's so common, I shouldn't even bring it up any more). Not to mention, the persistent downpour seems to arrive too often on cue.

Yet I still recommend YEH DILLAGI. At best, the film is enlivened by the actors' performances. At worse, it's a curiousity piece for those who want to see these three stars together. Again, the likability of YEH DILLAGI hinges on the magnetic Kajol. She isn't like Audrey Hepburn, in personality or temperament. But they're both vibrant and they both exude that timeless star presence. And, I figure, a soaking wet Kajol planting a kiss on her man goes a long way into putting a body in a good mood.",1209254400,3,5285,4.971719457013575

It was not a remake of an American movie, but it did get it's inspiration from an American movie which was also a favorite of mine. Both were very good, yet told the story differently.

8262378,3,B0016GONA0,"Sapna (Kajol), the chauffeur's daughter, goes to Mumbai to become a model so that she can earn money and be on equal footing with her father's rich employers.  She matures and gains confidence, and as a result turns the heads of both of the sons of the house: Vicky, unprincipled playboy (Saif Ali Khan) and hardworking businessman Vijay (Akshay Kumar) Their mother (Reema Lagoo) is a stickler for social position, and refuses to allow either son to consider an alliance with the daughter of a servant.  They woo Sapna in their own way, and when one wins her love, he faces the difficulty of brotherly conflict and parental disapproval.

On the face of it, this romantic comedy (loosely based on Hollywood's Sabrina), is a love triangle that pits brotherly love against romantic love.  The story goes deeper than that, though, and becomes an evaluation of social snobbery.

It is a mostly fun film, but to my surprise contained two somewhat steamy scenes that didn't seem typical of a 1990's Bollywood movie, and detracted from the experience.  I also had a difficult time enjoying Lagoo's performance.  She's my favorite Bollywood mummy, and I'm not used to seeing her in an unsympathetic role.  The acting of the three main characters was good, and they had fine chemistry together.  The music was average, but there were some entertaining dance scenes.  Were it not for the two detractors mentioned above, this would be a 4 star movie, but as a result, I could only find it average.",1507766400,,1485,4.83399209486166
