8139843,1,B000HIVISI,"The only reason to even give this film one star is because of its attractive leads.  Set in a cabin, it feels stagey, like an adaptation of a play that never leaves its set, and therefore gives you (pun intended) cabin fever while watching it.

Christopher Stapeleton is a competent actor and could probably give a great performance but he isn't directed all that well here. Missy Crider, famous for soft core films, is surprisingly better here than she is in other material. The two actors look great together and could actually produce some sparks in the right film together.

""Seclusion"" feels like a lost (and overlong) episode of ""Red Shoes Diaries,"" even up to a somewhat ironic ending. However, the actors and filmmakers have no nerve. We get nothing but coy, G-rated, network television-quality love scenes in a film that is ABOUT an elicit affair. Even in the morning after scene, Stapleton gets out of bed with the camera staying well above his waist, and then he wraps the obligatory sheet around himself although he is all alone. Afternoon soap opera  actors show more nerve.

Most annoying is that the DVD cover is they type that just shouts ""sexy,"" while the film could practically play on any local TV station without offending even the biggest prude.

So, just what is the point of this movie, then?  If it uses sex to sell itself but is, in reality, so completely chaste, then why bother with making it?  That question is being asked too late. The real question is why would anyone--knowing all of this--want to buy it?

I look forward to more from Stapleton and Crider, but hopefully next time they won't be so chaste and prim.",1243814400,,1645,4.70383275261324
