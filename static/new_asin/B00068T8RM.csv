8541042,3,B00068T8RM,"This video offers a great combination of rare space footage and the ultra modernistic rock of Jan Hammer.  It is not necessarily a documentary as there is no written or spoken word.  It is purely video of various launches and landings set to music.  It is truly an entertainment piece.

For those who have an interest in space, the footage sequences are spectacular.  Many of the songs by Jan Hammer are also exclusive to this video.",1211932800,,433,4.644736842105263
