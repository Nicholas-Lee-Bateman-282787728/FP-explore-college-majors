4515875,4,B0050N0US4,"It has all kinds of problems and isn't really all that great, frequently jumps over the top and loses credibility, but its so fast-paced that it doesn't matter. Plus its so much better than anything on U.S television that its like Citizen Kane in comparison. I've increasingly taken to watching my fave UK TV programs (Midsomer Murders, Lewis, New Tricks, etc) with the English subtitles on; its slightly annoying but I pick up quite a bit that would otherwise be missed. With Vera especially I would have lost much of what was going on; with the dialect, idioms, and overall way of speaking English its nearly like a foreign language.  I was thinking especially after watching episode 2 that I'm not sure there was a single sentence uttered that would be said in the same way in the U.S. which is kind of fun in a way.",1316563200,15,819,4.571428571428571
4515876,5,B0050N0US4,"The  reviews to this outstanding British mystery series on four (4) DVDs with four (4) episodes running about an hour and one-half each have stated that DCI Vera Blenching (brilliantly acted by Brenda Blethyn) the lead investigating detective is a loner, and is rather cantankerous (bordering on nasty).  I, after viewing this very fine series, found Vera  NOT to be so cantankerous, cruel or nasty just a very private(she, comes across, as a ""loner"") individual that is extremely good at solving some really horrendous and puzzling cases that kept me unsuccessfully trying to guess ""who done it?"" until all was revealed.

I found this series very intriguing with four (4)  really good and suspenseful mysteries plus it is acted fabulously.  By the way, I adore the character of Vera--she really comes across as a highly efficient detective that ""ain't"" too cuddly or too comfortable with young kids.

I used the subtitles because I found the North England English a little hard to understand.",1315612800,103,993,5.0552147239263805
4515877,5,B0050N0US4,"These video adaptations of Ann Cleeves books are some of the best entertainment I have seen in a long time. Having read the books made them even better.
  It seems they make better TV shows in the UK :o)",1314748800,83,203,4.17948717948718
4515878,5,B0050N0US4,"DCI Vera is crude, slovenly, crabby, obsessed, uninviting, and has a caustic mouth. She's a female Columbo. She'll get the job done, her way, so stick that in your beer and drink it-her way! You may find Vera less than respectable, but she finds killers. This first series has four 89-minute episodes [WITH SUBTITLES]. Teens and older recommended due to violence and gritty scenes. The episodes are named and adapted after mystery novels by Ann Cleeves. The Northumberland filming locale (the same place as Catherine Cookson stories) is delightful and parallels the books' venue. The shows ratings have fostered a 2012 2nd season.

Brenda Blethyn (Atonement, Pride & Prejudice) as Vera, leads the team. DS Joe (David Leon) is the young family man and assistant. Single DC Holly (Wunmi Mosaku) looks for acceptance of her ample crime fighting help, while forensics is covered by Cartwright (Paul Ritter). DC Kenny (Jon Morrison) first appears, gets canned, and then rehired in episode 2. This nucleus cast questions guest stars playing criminals and victims.

1 HIDDEN DEPTHS: Murdered teen Luke's widowed mother Julie (Gina McKee-""Forsyte Saga"", ""Atonement"") tells DCI Vera about Luke's friend Tommy drowning earlier. Connection? Teacher Lily Marsh is killed. Finding her is a bird-outing group, Peter ((Murray Head-""Sunday Bloody Sunday"") & Felicity Calvert (Juliet Aubrey-""MiddleMarch""); Gary (Neil Armstrong) Julie's friend; Clive (Paul Higgins-""Hope Strings"" view that show) the woman's-man. A new missing teen puts the case into compelling high gear.

2 TELLING TALES: Jeannie Long (Sarah Preston) escapes from prison, fights with dad, & steps in front of a bus. Vera tells Long's former lover Mantel (Hugo Speer-""Full Monty"",""Bleak House"" `05) new evidence proving Long did not kill his daughter. Former Probation Officer Robert Winter's (Gary Lewis-""Gangs of NY"") son is murdered. Quite suspicious! Vera catches her predecessor, DCI Fletcher (Lolita Chakrabarti-""Fortysomething"") and Mantel in an affair. More suspicious! More murder makes this case as crazy as Vera.

3 THE CROW TRAP: A body in a barn is found by environmentalist Anne Preece (Daniela Nardini-""Reckless"",""Sirens"") hoping to stop a new quarry headed by Waugh (Daniel Flynn-""The Bill""). Murdered Bella (Jane Holman) had refused to sell land. Edmund Fulwell (John Lynch-""Sliding Doors"",""The Passion"") another against the quarry; Mrs Waugh (Susie Trayling); Grace (Amy Cudden) Waugh's new spicy hired girl all are questioned. What's with the affair twixt Anne & Waugh? Others are in danger because of the quarry. The `Why?' puts Vera between a rock & a hard place.

4 LITTLE LAZARUS: Vera, kid loather, baby-sits a boy who witnessed his mom's, Margaret (Laura Norton) murder. Adam's (Sam Jarvis) memory holds clues to the murder. He recognizes Judge Patricia Carmichael (Kerry Fox-""A Village Affair"",""The Affair"") calling her Tia. Husband Aiden Carmichael (Tim Dutton-""Patriot Games"") is Mr. Mom to child Sorcha (Alice Sykes). Adams runs away and hides, only to witness another murder. What is the connection? Kieran O'Brien (""Cracker"", ""Life on Mars"") also guest stars as Bobby Salter.

What a disheveled cunning copper couple VERA and COLUMBO could have made.
This also reminds me of the new crime show ""The Glades"" but that one is Florida-USA, not ""Vera's"" northeastern England-UK. Both excellent and recommended.
Anyone remember the days when a murder mystery had one murder? Did ""Midsomer Murders"" [one of the best series] begin the new trend of multiple murder mayhem?

4515883,5,B0050N0US4,"I am enjoying this challenging show immensely.  I say challenging because I find her character hard to understand.  She is very reactive and not positive with her competent staff, but makes snarky remarks and seems to only get along with her partner, Joe.  I suppose she is a unique character but I know for me I always had a bit of fear of authority figures, and I would try to stay out of their line of fire.  It would be difficult to do that with this woman, as she seems to be forever snarky.  I do love when she gets tough during an interview.  I think having as much responsibility for solving capital crimes must be a horrendous burden, and she is able to to guide her team along the path to solving these perplexing crimes.  I do like that a woman is the boss, though, a tough one at that.  I found myself thinking that for the black detective it seems like a toxic work environment.  Vera seems oblivious to how she affects others.",1506556800,,940,4.325714285714286

4515892,4,B0050N0US4,"""Vera"" Series 1 introduced DCI Vera Stanhope (Brenda Blethyn) of the fictional Northumberland & City Police to television audiences in 2011. Based on the novels of Ann Cleeves, DCI Stanhope is a cantankerous, late-middle-aged chief homicide investigator somewhere in the county of Northhumberland in northeastern England. Instead of city coppers and confined spaces, we see ocean and open landscapes that give the impression of always being chilly. While many of the murders take place in town, the countryside always plays a role. As the series opens, Vera's father had recently died. He will be the source of much angst in subsequent series. ""He was a bully,"" she says. So we know where she gets the tendency. This first series doesn't veil the indifference, or worse, with which Vera treats her colleagues, though she has a soft spot for Joe.

DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon) is Vera's more laid-back, socially skilled sidekick. In Series 1, he and wife Celine are expecting their third child, and another baby puts the household and Joe under strain. We don't actually see Celine in this series, at least not her face. Her appearance is reserved for Series 2. Other members of Vera's team are veteran officer DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) and DC Holly Lawson (Wunmi Mosaku), who tries hard to please Vera, usually in vain. Vera has a major conflict with each of her team members in the course of the season. The first three episodes are based on Ann Cleeves' novels; the forth episode was written by Paul Rutman. This first series is a little more intricately plotted than future series, and Vera is a little more frumpy. But Brenda Blethyn makes this abrasive woman interesting to watch. The show is fortunate to have her.

The episodes are:

Julie Armstrong (Gina McKee) returns to her home in the evening to find her 15-year-old son Luke (Sam Fender) dead in the bath in ""Hidden Depths."" DCI Stanhope and DS Ashworth determine that the boy was strangled and placed meticulously in the bath surrounded by candles and flowers, while his 14-year-old sister Laura (Gabrielle Ross) slept. Luke had been upset after the accidental death of his friend Tommy Sharpe on the beach 4 months before. Tommy's father Davy Sharp (Craig Conway) was recently released from prison and looking for answers about his son's death. Meanwhile, a young teacher, Lily Marsh (Samantha Neale), proposes to rent a beach hut from one of her student's family, the Calverts, who have a connection to the Armstrongs through friend Gary Wright (Neil Armstrong).

Jeannie Long (Sarah Preston) escapes while being driven from prison to a hospital for surgery in ""Telling Tales."" She runs to her father Michael's (Alan Williams) home but steps in front of a bus when he rejects her. Jeannie was convicted of killing Abigail Mantel, the teenaged daughter of her domestic partner Keith Mantel (Hugo Speer), 11 years ago. Though Jeannie's death appears to be suicide, Holly discovers that she had an alibi when looking through the old files. This convinces Vera to reopen the murder investigation, which was led by DI Caroline Fletcher (Lolita Chakrabarti), now retired from the force. Vera visits probation officer Robert Winter (Gary Lewis), who was assigned to Jeannie's case, and learned that Jeannie had given him information to pursue an appeal.

In ""The Crow Trap"", Bella Furness (Jane Holman) is struck and falls to her death while climbing to the loft of her barn. Bella opposed a local quarry project whose road would be built through her property. She was hosting Ann Preece (Daniela Nardini) to do an environmental impact study. Bella lived with her invalid husband Dougie (Jack McBride) in town. Bella's stepson Neville (Richard Short), who dislikes his father, assumes power of attorney and intends to sell the land. Bella's good friend Edmund Fulwell (John Lynch), a radical environmentalist who family once owned the land, also staunchly opposes the project. But Bev McDonald (Elizabeth Carling) is glad Bella died, as she blames Bella for the disappearance of her 5-year-old son years ago, when Bella was on the moor.

The bludgeoned body of Margaret Wilde (Laura Norton) is left in a field while her 11-year-old son Adam (Sam Jarvis) flees in ""Little Lazarus"". Adam barely survives a fall into a stream but can't identify his mother's assailant. Nor can he say where they lived, as they moved frequently, always hiding from something. Margaret and Adam were on their way to Malaga, Spain and were to meet her old friend and lover Bobby Salter (Kieran O'Brien) at the airport. Vera first suspects Salter, as he was married and infatuated with Margaret. When Adam sees high court judge Patricia ""Tia"" Carmichael (Kerry Fox) on television and recognizes her as an acquaintance of his mother's, Vera thinks there must be a connection, but Joe is skeptical and reluctant to investigate a high court judge.",1487116800,,4886,5.011083743842365

4515896,4,B0050N0US4,"I decided to Try ""Vera"" after getting hooked on ""Foyle's War,"" and also because I like what I had seen of Brenda Blethyn in movies.  She is great here, in the first season of a series of four basically separate movies, and I wondered if the series -- which as far as I know is still continuing -- set itself up as a kind of anti-Foyle, at least in visual style.  The cinematography here is often angled in odd ways, and Vera herself is often shot from behind or slightly below, and often too in violent motion that creates a kind of visceral urgency that we don't find in Foyle.  There's nothing glamorous about these effects -- Vera is a dumpy, frumpy 60-year-old woman Detective Chief Inspector, and when she breaks into a run we feel the full awkwardness of it.  But the plots are tight, and Vera is very smart and very intuitive, and the individual episodes found my interest and engagement increasing as the series went on.

The setting here is not historical -- it's geographical: the Tyneside area of Northern England, largely rural in the part where Vera works, and the landscape, often filmed with a low horizon, is both bleak and beautiful.  The feeling of the landscape of ""Wuthering Heights"" suggested itself to me,  but there's no sense that this topography is offered to explain the bad behavior of the denizens.  I'm not going to get into plot summary because I want to avoid spoilers -- give it a try, and you're likely to be hooked.",1477180800,,1449,4.546153846153846

4515918,5,B0050N0US4,"Rough, lonesome at times landscapes and windswept shorelines and crags are some of the backdrop for this murder mystery series.  Equally rough around the edges, clearly lonely in her life, but dedicated to the core is the police detective that the show is named after, Vera.  She is certainly no Hollywood star as she slouches around in haphazard clothing with her hair needing a comb at times and a hat often pulled down low.  She also is very plain-spoken, even harsh at times, yet you can still see it is all a shell to hide how much she cares within.

Vera is a fascinating character as she unravels various murder mysteries.  Unlike many other tv shows, you never know whodunit until near the end and, often, the ending has its own bittersweet flavor to it.  Yes, they find the killer(s), but it won't bring back the dead or stop the pain of those who lost their loved one.  There are really no ""happy"" endings in this show, but should there be when murder is involved?  This show tells it like it is more than most.  Vera is definitely, despite her bulldoggedness (or maybe because of it) just the kind of cop you'd want on the case.

LOVE this British series.  Am haunted by the landscapes and the people who are a match for it, including Vera herself.  These stories really stick with you...",1435190400,,1299,4.527896995708154

4515953,5,B0050N0US4,"VERA, Season 1. (2011- ) This is a new, contemporaneously set British television series made by ITV. The British mystery series/police procedural, in its 2014 fourth season, returned to record ratings in the United Kingdom. The series has aired in the United States on PBS channels. It is based on the best-selling mysteries of British author Ann Cleeves, and like her work, is set in the extreme northeast of England, just under the Roman-built Hadrian's Wall, which nearly separates England from Scotland.

The production stars two-time Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (LITTLE VOICE, SECRETS AND LIES, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, ATONEMENT) as DCI Vera Stanhope, a solitary, obsessed, caustic investigator with a messy persona and private life. She's 40 pounds overweight, a bit disheveled; dresses for comfort and warmth in the brutal Northumberland winters:  I think in two whole episodes of this first series, she's wearing what looks to be a housedress with a collar.  You can think female Columbo. The production is available streaming or in a boxed set that includes four feature-length, character-driven crime dramas on four discs. For mature audiences. And thank you, RLJ Entertainment-Acorn, it's got subtitles: otherwise don't know what we'd do with the local accent on this side of the pond. I received this as a review copy.

Stanhope pursues the truth in the cases of murder, kidnapping, and blackmail that occur on her patch of Geordie-land. She's driven by her own demons; fails to follow the rules of proper nutrition; hides her loneliness well; drinks more than she ought. We're told she lost her mother as a young child, was raised by a distant, eccentric father, is estranged from her only sister. She's a complex character: a brilliant, independent cop with a dumb private life; a character that undoubtedly requires an actress of Blethyn's skill.  She's supported by her sidekick Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, as played by the locally born David Leon, (a BAFTA winner for ROCKnROLLA), who, later in the series characterizes his part with an odd, bowlegged walk, as if he were malnourished as a child and had rickets. Also playing roles in the cop shop are Paul Ritter and Jon Morrison. Episodes 1, 2 and 3 of this series are based on the Cleeves novels of the same names. The episodes are:

Disc 1
Episode 1:  Hidden Depths
A handsome young man, a flirtatious student teacher, nothing apparently in common between them--except that both were murdered, left with their bodies meticulously posed.  Features the also locally-born Gina McKee as Julie Armstrong, mother of the first victim, and the threatened third, (IN THE LOOP (2009), NOTTING HILL (1999), ATONEMENT (2007)).

Disc  2
Episode 2:  Telling Tales
This episode is bookended by two telling vignettes of Vera on the beach, and a bunch of soccer-playing boys, and their ball.  It centers on Jeanie Long, who was found guilty of murder 11 years ago, despite the existence of an alibi, and unwaveringly maintaining her innocence. DCI Stanhope must put together the pieces of a decade-old crime on the strength of new evidence.

Disc 3
Episode 3:  The Crow Trap
This episode features a priceless vignette in which Vera offers Fishermans Friends, old fashioned cough drops, to two hungry children.  Groundbreaking begins on a rock quarry in the moorlands; a local woman who had opposed the construction is found murdered. She had been pressured to sell her land to the developers but refused. Another woman with connections to the impending project is killed, and a third is at risk.

Disc 4
Episode 4:  Little Lazarus
This episode opens with DCI Stanhope in a supermarket, stocking up on desserts, ice cream, frozen meals, and snacks.  You'd better believe Vera is generally indifferent towards children, yet she finds herself acting as caretaker for a boy whose life she has saved: his mother was murdered before his eyes.

These powerful free-standing episodes have been filmed in the original villages of the Cleeves crime novels; the bleak, lonely landscapes of Northumberland, a region of the U.K. that has traditionally suffered, and still does, from underemployment,  look beautiful here.  Residents of the region appear to largely live, and spend their time, in stone-built structures, frequently isolated, and it's tempting to describe them as frequently stony-hearted.  The mysteries are muscular, and so, uniformly, is the acting, with particular praise due Blethyn, who has created in Vera a strong yet vulnerable  character. The stories are enhanced by a dark and moody sound track, dark and realistic  shows that deal with middle and lower class people, in contrast to most glossy American cop shows, female-centered or not.  In further contrast to the female leads of most American TV cop shows, Vera's not young, pretty, sexy or well-dressed. She doesn't have a husband, or a lover, and doesn't seem interested in getting one. She doesn't have a social or family life and doesn't seem interested in getting one. She's interested in getting her perps, man or woman, and she does. I love this series, loved Set 3 and 4, which I reviewed on their websites in these pages, and expect nothing can stop me getting to series 2. If you're not familiar with the series, the episodes are free-standing, and you can just as well start with the more current series 3 and 4 as with this first, which does, however, give you a couple of clues as to Vera's background.",1408492800,,5439,5.043526785714286

4515962,4,B0050N0US4,"I enjoy most of the PBS mysteries, especially Lewis, Sherlock, Wallander & Endeavour.  Vera is a different type of character than usually seen on PBS.  This woman is quite ornery, stubborn & downright rude at times, but underneath the tough exterior she has a soft heart.  Her sidekick Joe is very tolerant of her and at times you almost pity him for what he puts up with in his daily dealings with his boss. Pretty much like a mother and son relationship though neither would admit to it.  The British, sometimes slightly Irish, accents sometimes get a bit hard to understand here, but overall the show is quite good.  I never quite got into the long-running Inspector Lynley series.  The chemistry between the characters has to be there and in VERA I feel it is.",1403740800,,764,4.622222222222222

However, I appreciated this series more after seeing the second series and in retrospect would give it 4 stars.  Unfortunately, if you just view series 2, you won't fully appreciate the sub stories and probably won't fully enjoy the series.",1402790400,6,501,4.6477272727272725

There are times the northern English accent gets in the way of my understanding what they are saying, but not so bad that a quick rewind at those times isn't helpful.  It isn't so much understanding her as it is a couple of her staff and the occasional local characters.  The quality of the series makes up for any language difficulty.  The best way to describe her is to say, she is a female Columbo.  A little frumpy and unkempt with her form of dress and raincoat, but that only adds charm to her detective skills at work.  This series is very entertaining.",1402790400,,646,4.297520661157025

4515968,5,B0050N0US4,Brenda Blethyn is perfect! I liked it so much that I ordered season two and will probably order season three.,1398038400,,109,4.5
4515969,3,B0050N0US4,"Brenda Blethyn has enjoyed a long and distinguished career on stage and film. She is well-known for her creative partnership in the films of innovative director Mike Leigh. She has done Shakespeare. She knows her stuff.

Someone, somewhere, decided that Brenda Blethyn should star in her own television series.  Wonderful idea!

How about a cop show? Hmmm. With all due respect to Ms. Blethyn, how old is she? 65? Isnt that about the age when John Nettles retired from Midsomer Murders?

Ann Cleves, whose prolific career includes her being the first recipient of the Duncan Lawrie Dagger, the richest prize in the world for crime writers, was the novelist of choice to provide the source material for an initial four-part series of feature length police dramas starring Brenda Blethyn, called VERA.

It doesnt work. Period.

With the talents of the star and the source novelist, why? As with all criticism, this is just one persons opinion, but here is why I believe VERA fails to deliver.

The lead actors age makes her unbelievable in the role. Its physically impossible for her to be out in the field hunting down bad guys. The predominant atmosphere Vera creates on screen is somebody get her a chair! Huffing, puffing, half-crying  pity  the plod with a boss who cant stand on her own.

The character of Vera is intensely unlikeable and there are times you just want to turn off the TV. Helen Mirren showed us in Prime Suspect that we don't have to like the lead character to be intrigued by her. But Vera is 1 part intrigue to 3 parts irritation. Not a viable formula. She is abrasive, judgmental, emotional, petty, and dresses like a frumpy old bag lady. Im not suggesting she should be a fashion plate, but she is a professional, not a curmudgeonly next-door-neighbour who has unexpectedly dropped in for tea and won't leave.

Maybe I missed something, but the script writing isn't very good, either. She is supposedly a drunk, but all the script does is show her sneaking slugs of booze. She never appears intoxicated and never experiences consequences. She is horrible to her team, yet they remain fiercely loyal. Her brilliant mind is conveyed by showing her sitting alone staring off into space, and suddenly coming up with an idea that has no clues to back it up. Thats not brilliant, thats psychic  and an indication of lazy writing. Nothing about this lead character inspires confidence.

VERAs saving grace is the cinematography. Every episode has at least one brilliantly composed shot of the bleak horizon or some such thing. But this does not a compelling police drama make.

And yet, she has been renewed for another season. Somebodys obviously a fan, but frankly the pool of police dramas is just too rich to bother with VERA. Unless you're such a passionate fan of the genre you simply must have all you can get (or you want to see gorgeous footage of Northumberland with annoying people in front of it), you might want to give her a pass.",1397433600,4,2962,4.771037181996086
4515970,5,B0050N0US4,"Wasn't sure at first, why I was watching this abrasive, seemingly self centered detective.  Her wardrobe appears like that of my Mother, and friends Mothers, in the early sixties; frumpy ""house"" dresses topped by equally frumpy cardigans.  Well she ""grows"" on you.  You find she  is not uncaring, simply so involved with working her case, she doesn't see, or maybe doesn't understand the frustration she is causing her staff.  She really cares about the victims and finding the solution.  You can look forward to her solving the crime, and frequently giving the ""perp"" their comeuppance.",1396828800,,587,5.126315789473685

In contrast to the urban grit of the excellent show Spender, and the Scottish Taggart<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taggart-Set-1/dp/B001JXPC64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taggart: Set 1</a>, this series is set mostly in rural Northumberland although it is very opaque about whether it is in Northumberland itself or the rural areas of County Durham.

The focus is on the character, a strong woman with her own failings and sometimes blinded by aspects of her past, but who leads a team of individuals who all seem to bring their domestic life to work with them.

Mostly there are the standard mystery story elements of many possible suspects and red herrings but there is also a compulsion about viewing it.

My biggest grouse with this show is the dastardly way in which Northumbria is represented. Mostly we see homes which are set in wild lonesome landscapes or else dwarfed by massive industrial plants or architecture such as the Angel of the North. Even Northumberland's glorious heritage of fine castles is overlooked by the use of the ruin that is Dunstanburgh Castle which stands guard over the beautiful bay at Embleton in real life.

By implication, the desolate landscapes are visited on the inhabitants who are seen as surly, hardened individuals, shorn of the more pleasant aspects of humanity.

The reality of Northumberland and Durham is strong self-supporting communities and although there are pockets of isolation they are the exception rather than the rule.

Northumberland is a fine county with much outstanding beauty and much to wonder at and it is sad to see it portrayed in such a manner.",1344729600,3,1719,5.301470588235294

4516003,5,B0050N0US4,"If your taste falls towards a good mystery with quirky characters, this is the series for you. ""Vera"" as a character is fairly intense and goes sort of crazy on some occasions if the clues just don't seem to fit. Her poor Sgt. has to endure most of her wrath and still maintain an air of competence. While his home life and young family go through the trails of daily life mostly on their own..
This may seem to the fan to be horribly unfair but in truth you see that Vera herself is a tormented soul, who cares deeply for her Sgt. as she would for the son she will never have...
The writing is extremely well done and keeps the fan at best befuddled, and at worst, just as frustrated as the main character..
The story lines are uncommonly interesting and as a bonus you get to see the north eastern coast of England. A place that has a haunting beauty all its own...",1342137600,2,867,4.228915662650603
4516004,5,B0050N0US4,"Brenda Blethyn as DCI Vera Stanhope, could be the most perfect female detective, yet. She is everything that is not expected, brash, rude, intelligent, crafty, and dresses like some old widowed marm. She sneaks up on you, and she lands a wallop!

Not quite sure where Vera practices her craft. Somewhere there is a city that runs ino the sea and near the rambling fields of yore.
Blethyn is surely one of the oldest DCI 's to come down the pike, but she is also one of the smoothest. Because of her looks, short, chubby, hair dressed with an egg beater, no make- up, come as you are, she is taken for granted, until she is recognized for her wit and cunning. She shouts at her staff, cursing them at times, but she is their mother. They are always looking at her for acceptance. Vera has given her life to her job. No husband, no children, a father that recently died, and he wanted grandchildren. Her second in command, David Leon, as DS Joe Asworth, is the very handsome young husband and father, who is always needed at home, but loves his job. Joe is Vera's one and only friend, though he does call her Mussolini when at home.

Vera can solve any crime, it seems. We can see it on her face, as a new clue creeps in, her face softens and reflects and she comes awake. Vera, it seems, is afraid to love. Her crew are her family, and she cares for them, but Joe And DC Holly are the two she cares most about. She tries to be a hard azz, but she is in reality a softie. We know it, and we come to trust and love her. Bring it on, Vera!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-10-12

4516005,5,B0050N0US4,"She's not playing Mama this time.  Vera Stanhope is a Northumbrian detective with a handsome, much younger sidekick.  Getting up there in years, Vera is overweight, disheveled, rumpled and initially non-threatening with her Geordie accent.  Beware of her, however, when she stops going all-Columbo on you and homes in, staring holes through your forehead and promising you long nights in a cold cell.  The aw-shucks casual questioner becomes the grand inquisitor the moment she has all of the facts in hand.

The stories (4 to date) are strong, the plots reasonably clear, the supporting cast effective.  The tone is dark, the crimes heinous.  The closest parallel is the Kenneth Branagh Wallander series, with panoramic views of stark landscapes, landscapes that parallel the moral emptiness of the perps and their stories.  The tone is slightly different, with an older, female protagonist, but Vera suffers from the same varieties of loneliness as Wallander and in each case the moral undertone is that we are witnessing a detective who sacrifices the rest of life to this task because it is a personal and professional obligation.  There is some of that in Frost, of course, but Frost adds humor, romantic subplots, and the love of good Indian food.  Vera Stanhope, by contrast, is all business.

This is a promising new series.  Check it out, but prepare yourself for a tour of the other side of human life.",1329955200,4,1412,5.012875536480687
4516006,5,B0050N0US4,"Vera upstages Sherlock Holmes by way of using more than logic to figure out whodunit. And then there's something de-glamourized about the whole picture to compare this much to an Agatha Christie novel.  Vera is in a class of her own.  There is something akin to Prime Suspect to the story, partly because of Vera's status as head honcho despite predictability.

Yet there is marked difference in Vera Stanhope and Jane Tennison [of Prime Suspect]. Vera is frumpy and ""what you see is what you get"" in dealing with others.  She never makes efforts to please other people so that they accept her.  She also gives the impression that she got to the top through gritty talent alone--not through persistent determination to prove anything to other people.  She is almost like a bull on the loose.  Just get out of her way people.  She's coming through and is headed in the direction of her choosing.

Vera also shirks any interest in a relationship with anyone.  Maybe she, at least in this season 1, knows that she should do something to stabilize her mercurial temperament.  At the same time, she is so busy in moving to the house she once saw to her dad in; and she's busy with case after case...all without much time to consider relationships.  It seems that she and Joe (the other one on the cover art) have a working professional relationship, and Joe wades through the struggles of being a new family man at the same time he's in a demanding profession.  Ironically, he seems to find his stability in life through Vera.

It looks like it could be difficult at times to work with Vera, but what I'd tell Joe, Holly, any of them: It's rare to have a boss so honest you always know where she stands.  Even if your head is bitten off and thrown on the floor, you know where you stand with her.  I like that Vera doesn't play games, but I do think Holly deserves more encouragement for a job well done than she usually gets.

I absolutely adore Vera.  She comes across as very real.  As a literary creation initially, her character is free of any formulas that have already been used.  Hollywood should sincerely take a cue from this drama that the obvious appeal in casting middle aged Talent Giants like Brenda Blethyn is not a recipe for disaster, but is in fact, a winning choice that many viewers appreciate.

Vera cracked me up in some episodes with her serious need for anger management help, but at the same time, I hope she stays true to her temperamental character throughout the run of the series...and I'm hoping it will be a considerable run.",1329436800,10,2552,4.564835164835165

4516014,5,B0050N0US4,"This series is set in the beautiful UK coutryside of Northumberland - sea, beautiful beaches and rugged landscapes. Perhaps I'm promoting the locale rather than Vera?! I bought the set for lovely friends who live in Santa Barbara, so there is a similiarity in terms of sea and landscapes. Not in climate though. I wanted them to get a flavour of where I live in the UK as well as enjoy an excellent series. Brenda Blethyn as Vera is superb and got to grips very well with our local distinctive dialect. The stories/episodes are all of a very high standard. The cinematography reminds me of Scandavian movies a la Ingmar Bergman. Beautiful, atmospheric shots that really add to the mood of the stories. Don't worry...these aren't bleak tales. Very entertaining and intelligent acting and stories. The character Vera is very engaging and not at all glamourous. A ""real"" person as portrayed by Brenda with foibles and perhaps reflective about how life might have turned out for her, rather than simply a having career and maybe little else. So, Vera for Americans is different in terms of the location and the type of characters portrayed. I don't believe you'll be disappointed in any respect.

Episode two explains so much I missed plot wise, by not watching this episode first. Sometimes the photography is rather dark, but so authentic. I love Midsomer Murders. However, Single-Handed and Vera are now my two favorites. If anyone can tell me what ""bierens"" or some sort of slang for kids is, I would appreciate it.

The scene burning her father's possessions, and saying I like this ""farm couple AND the scene helping a lost little boy who is hiding, when she lacks mothering skills, are priceless.

4516017,5,B0050N0US4,"The rumpled DCI Vera Stanhope is salt of the earth, what a refreshing character. The driving force and star is the fine actress Brenda Blethyn as Vera. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern landscape, weathering storms of conflict. The Northumberland villages, soft northern light, and seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape. The marvelous Brenda Blethyn and crew are authentic and entertaining. David Leon, as her sidekick, is capable, and it's a treat to catch the fine and underrated John Lynch of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-Roan-Inish/dp/B00004TJKJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of Roan Inish</a>, among others, as guest stars. Gina McKee is superb in the first mystery, as a mother coping with economic hardships; she lives in a modest row-house, on a block where the Northumberland sky seems to slam down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. Her pathos over her losses it utterly believable.

The Brits reward actors who are robust, plump, assertive, deeply human, and divinely wrinkled, while too often American TV is dominated by polished, dull, and immobile faces. ""Vera"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. The dialect is easy to understand, the rich nouns as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale; subtitles are utterly unnecessary. In the first mystery, ""Hidden Depths,"" we're introduced to Vera, who is coping with the recent death of her father. This loss haunts all the subsequent mysteries. As she says, a culprit is ""caught in the act of being alone."" Slugging down whisky under a sullen sky, she declares such loneliness is ""not for the faint-hearted."" Dust to water, Vera sheds her father's ashes in the sea. But the absence of a loving father, of caring familial connections, continues to haunt Vera, as she, and another woman who was tragically and falsely accused of murder, find in ""Telling Tales."" Some tragedies in life have no clear, happy resolution, as the ""Crow Trap"" and ""Little Lazarus"" explore.

I look forward to much more of the bad-tempered and authentic ""Vera,"" hopefully the series will continue for many more seasons! The evocative, bleakly beautiful Northumberland landscape is a welcome and perfect stage for these intense mysteries.
