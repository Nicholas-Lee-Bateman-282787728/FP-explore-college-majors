8501505,3,B006NZQ1EK,"Horror hosts and their fans, people nostalgic for New Orleans, Z- (not B-) movie fanatics -- this movie is for us.
If you're not in those categories... you're not gonna have a good time.
Luckily for us (in those categories), it *is* a good time, with a short running time, good BW photography, local flavor, a look back at horror hosting's classic past, and -- well, I found Morgus one compelling host. His look is really impressively odd, and his voice and demeanor weirdly resemble Jeff Goldblum doing an odd character, sometimes. (Well, that's what I saw in him, anyway.) And you couldn't pay me to do Morgus' stunts (there's only one or two shots where I'm pretty sure it's not the main actor doing his own stunts), 'cause that stuff looks pretty dangerous. Goofy old horror-hosting fun for a select audience. (And no offense, Georgia, but this is way better than your old-time host Bestoink Dooley's movie, BLOOD BEAST OF MONSTER MOUNTAIN...)",1501718400,,947,4.815950920245399
8501506,5,B006NZQ1EK,"I watched Morgus The Magnificent in the early 60's as I was growing up in New Orleans. The whole family enjoyed it.  I don't know for sure if it was Morgus or the movie that made Saturday night so much fun but perhaps both along with some pizza did the trick.  This (Wacky World...) was the movie I remember seeing a the (I think it was) Carrollton Theater.  The other (Morgus Presents) was what we saw on TV each week.  What I enjoyed the most this time seeing the movie (after 50+ years) was the outdoor scenes of New Orleans, the one I grew up in.  That was awesome.  The French Quarter, old ramp up to the bridge, all of it.  I was a paperboy from about 64' to 70' and my friend Al and I rode all over New Orleans (including the West Bank via the Canal St. Ferry).  This movie reminds me of all of it and I thank all of those who made it possible.  Thank you Sid, producers and especially the gentleman who dug this up after Katrina had destroyed so much of the original material.",1483920000,,984,4.136842105263158

8501509,5,B006NZQ1EK,"I have to give it a 5 because I'm a native New Orleanian and this brings so many memories of my childhood.  The acting is okay... some of the plot is sort of lame... but for all its goofiness... it is funny.  Morgus and his assistant, Chopsley, are hysterical... and it's just a ""fun"" movie.  A good one to watch around Halloween--and despite his hideous looks (yeah as a kid he terrified me--but I still loved his TV show)... the kids would probably like it... no gore--no blood despite some rather peculiar procedures.... it's a ""family"" horror flick.  A quick gist is that Momus Alexander Morgus, who has a laboratory over the old city ice house in the French Quarter of New Orleans, has developed an instant ""people"" machine---some fictional foreign government becomes very interested in it and some weird espionage takes place.  I'll say no more; but this show was a TV Classic.. I'd get one before they run out--especially if you like old New Orleans!",1445904000,,957,4.706586826347305
