The documentary could have gone a bit deeper into the topic. but still a thought provoking piece.",1370476800,,133,5.090909090909091
8542386,5,B002QXLEUE,"The Neo African Americans is a thought-provoking inquiry into the underpinnings of the rift and/or bond between African/Caribbean immigrants to USA and African Americans. To some, there is a rift; to others, there is a bond. This documentary pries into every angle you could possibly think of -- from identity to affirmative action, from isolation to integration, from first generation perspective to second generation's, this documentary covers all bases. You will be engaged, never a boring moment in the film, and will come out very enlightened. As an African immigrant to the US myself, I found the subject relevant and the content resonated with me.",1337731200,,654,5.238095238095238
8542387,5,B002QXLEUE,"Kobina Aidoo, who filmed the one-hour documentary ""The Neo-African Americans,"" asked 13 people to describe themselves and got 13 different answers.

Why is the name so important? Is it because of the tension between the American-born blacks whose ancestors were slaves, and the new immigrants who speak English with exotic accents?

In Aidoo's film, the participants dscribe the relationship between the immigrant and native-born groups as ""strained,"" ""conflicted,"" and ""contentious."" There is ""resentment"" against the ""newcomers to this country"" who distance themselves from the black community and consider themselves better, i.e. ""not that black.""

Meanwhile it's been proven that immigrants are more likely to get the good job and be admitted to college. Aidoo interviews Princeton's Douglas Massey, who notes that - of the 12 percent of blacks admitted to colleges he surveyed - an unusual percentage, 25 percent, were immigrants. That is out of proportion to the population, and for the selective Ivies, the percentage was even higher, 40 percent.

American blacks point out that they have always lived in a country where they were the minority and had to fight for their rights, whereas African or Caribbean blacks had the opposite experience. ""We're always reminded of our place here,"" said one, ""but in their countries, they are the doctors, the lawyers, and the politicians.""

In this documentary, the immigrants sometimes agree. ""Folks need to change their attitudes,"" said one immigrant, suggesting that those who come from another country don't understand how American blacks have ""made sacrifices that make our lives more comfortable.""

In contrast to American born blacks who ""have the unique sense to transform American society,"" immigrants don't want to talk about, or think about, racial issues. ""I would like to have holistic conversations about everything - including race,"" said one.

So how do they want to be called? Rather than a variation of ""African American,"" most chose ""black,"" because it is inclusive. It can encompass and unify people of all backgrounds.

Still, as one woman said, ""I prefer being called by my first name.""

8542388,5,B002QXLEUE,"Being black and American isn't as straight forward as it used to be. Or was it ever really but people just didn't know? What is Barack Obama's identity, his ancestry? African American, is that it? Or Tiger Woods is he just black too or is he Caucablasian as he says?
Are these two people just anomalies or is there something else going on?

How many different types of black or African Americans are there? Many this documentary says. As many as there are countries, cultures and combinations of the two that one can have heritage from it turns out. Some countries, like Germany - not mentioned in the documentary -one wouldn't even think of.

As a black Trinidadian studying in America I remember different white people I met referring to African Americans as ""my people."" It seemed to be very idiotic to me since I had only been in America for about two years during those times and they knew it. If they had seen this video they would begin to understand how strange their statements were to me.

This video is a must-see for anyone black, white, Asian or other to understand a reality of being ""black"" in America that was right under their noses but seemingly invisible. Not only does it shine a light on the sense of identity of people with high levels of brown melanin in their skin - often their only similarity - but it introduces the question of other ""races"" and their identities in America. Is every spanish speaking person from Mexico or Cuba? I would love to see a similar documentary delve into that.

A fantastic, thought provoking piece from the rising talent of Kobina Aidoo.",1269907200,4,1592,4.614840989399293
