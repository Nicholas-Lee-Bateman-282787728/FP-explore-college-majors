4602341,4,B0058YPJ2W,"The hilarity continues! Great second season with nearly twice the amount of episodes over the first season. This is truly a sitcom that revels in its own ""sitcominess."" Pay attention because the jokes and references come at you FAST! My only complaint is with the rather cheap packaging--3 discs stacked on top of each other instead of in 3 separate trays.

4602455,5,B0058YPJ2W,"Season 2 is just as funny as the first season. Alex and Dave finally put aside their animosity towards each other (and in one episode, they even hook up). Brad and Jane go through the trials and tribulations of marriage. Penny is slightly more mature. Her hippie mother makes a cameo (Megan Mullally from Will and Grace and Parks and Recreation. She is so freaking hilarious). Max and Dave have a Mutt and Jeff relationship. The funniest episode of the season was definitely the Valentines episode.

I seriously don't know why they cancelled this show. Was it because there was an interracial couple? Or is it because people simply don't watch scripted comedies anymore?",1439164800,,670,4.87719298245614

4602788,5,B0058YPJ2W,"This was my favorite show on primetime television for the last three years. It's a shame ABC shifted it's time-slot like crazy until the ratings dropped to unsatisfactory statistics for the ""Friday Night Death Spot""
I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this box set. The show is hilarious, and the characters are so charming and loveable. It is safe to say that this is classic television. You will fall in love with cast! I could go on forever explaining my love for it. But just watch the show and you'll feel it too.",1377302400,,512,4.637362637362638
4602789,5,B0058YPJ2W,"All is have to say is: If you want to get rid of your everyday stress, this show is the best way to do it!!!
I can't stop watching it and I can't stop laughing either!!!",1377129600,,169,3.7222222222222223
4602790,5,B0058YPJ2W,It is a really really funny show.  Probably the best show you have probably never watched. You should watch it.,1375833600,,111,4.55
4602791,5,B0058YPJ2W,"If you liked Friends and Scrubs, you will like this show.  I knew it would be canceled, because it is good.  The character chemistry works well, least likable character being 'Max', played by Adam Pally.  Hopefully Season 3 will be released on dvd, at least we'll have that.",1373155200,,274,4.666666666666667
4602792,5,B0058YPJ2W,"I watch these episodes over and over and they get funnier every time I watch them. So much hidden humor. Each of the characters is well-developed and absolutely hilarious. Happy Endings has been cancelled, but supposedly may be picked up by another network. Believe me, I'll be staying tuned.",1371859200,,292,4.979591836734694
4602793,5,B0058YPJ2W,"Happy Endings is a full on great show. Perfect comedic timing, and a great cast to back the jokes up. Would recommend this show to anyone.",1371513600,,138,4.346153846153846
4602794,5,B0058YPJ2W,I will miss this show - such a great ensemble and writing talent.  Still not too late for another cable network to pick it up...anyone?,1370390400,,135,4.4
4602864,5,B0058YPJ2W,"This has become my favorite comedy (ever). I first started watching this series a couple months ago, and have watched each season 2-3 times each. My husband is obsessed with it, too. This show has great dialogue, hilarious situations, and an all around entertaining cast.

Great.

I really hope it's not canceled for good, and that another network picks it up. Or that it's continued through Netflix or something (like Arrested Development).",1366675200,,441,5.111111111111111
4602865,5,B0058YPJ2W,Sooooo funny!  This show cracks me up.  I really really hope it sticks around for awhile.  I received the DVDs so quickly.  Very impressed!,1365120000,,139,4.666666666666667
4602866,2,B0058YPJ2W,"Me and my wife really enjoyed season one, season two failed to impress. The writing went downhill and the show has lost our interest.",1364860800,2,133,4.583333333333333
4602867,5,B0058YPJ2W,I love love this show!  It's so funny I hope it doesn't get cancelled for another stupid reality show! Ugh!,1364428800,,107,4.35
4602868,5,B0058YPJ2W,I hope this show returns soon.  It's so funny and clever and the actors are wonderful.  Always makes me laugh. Love it!,1363737600,,119,4.363636363636363
4602869,5,B0058YPJ2W,"I love this show like crazy! But I can't buy the DVD in the UK :( So I was thinking to buy it from here, but will it playback on a UK bluray player? I know this isn't bluray but I only have a bluray player lol. Any help will be greatly appreciated! :-)",1363305600,,252,3.685185185185185
4602870,4,B0058YPJ2W,"I really love this show.
I think it's one of the funniest around.
I only put 4 stars because of the English subtitles of the DVD.
I speak good English (I think) but since it's not my birth language I like having
English subtitles. Especially with that kind of show were they speak quiet fast.
The subtitles on this DVD are worst than the one on iTunes!
Soooooo big and print on black background, it's too distracting.
Very amateurish, I had no idea it was possible in 2013.

But regarding the show... 5 stars.",1363132800,2,509,4.414893617021277
4602871,5,B0058YPJ2W,Hilarious show that keeps me interested and entertained. Love the dynamic characters that you can't find in any other comedic sitcoms.,1360454400,,134,5.428571428571429
4602872,4,B0058YPJ2W,"Happy Endings is the best. Who doesn't love this show? Seriously. Ok I really don't know what else to say here. It's a DVD. Obviously I'm going to rate this high, I bought it, right?",1360108800,,182,4.228571428571429
4602873,3,B0058YPJ2W,I had a hard time getting through the episodes in this season. I couldn't find the humor in the jokes as easily as first season.,1360022400,,128,4.16
4602954,5,B0058YPJ2W,This show is absolutely hilarious! A nice quirky comedy that helps with 30 Rock ending and Arrested Development not coming back for a few more months,1359158400,,149,4.769230769230769
4602955,5,B0058YPJ2W,Aaaaaaaaaaaaa love this show aaaaaa. Kkkkkk kkkkk lllll ooooo I do not have more words to add.  Please take this requirement OFF.,1359072000,,129,4.863636363636363

4602958,5,B0058YPJ2W,"LOVE this show!!! Only problem -- the kickball episode isn't included!! I love this show and couldn't wait to get the DVD -- it is in three different discs, and the extras are boring, but I love the show!",1357776000,,204,4.256410256410256
4602959,4,B0058YPJ2W,"I liked the odd frenetic energy of season 1 a lot. Season 2, IMHO, had a creaky start, but it really found a good balance a few episodes in.",1357603200,,140,3.8620689655172415
4602960,5,B0058YPJ2W,It was a xmas present for my son and he loved it.  Wished it would come out on blue ray.,1357516800,,88,3.4
4602961,5,B0058YPJ2W,One of the funniest shows on TV. Doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. It gets compared to Friends but they were great but not as edgy as this cast. Love them all!!!,1356825600,,173,4.117647058823529
4602962,5,B0058YPJ2W,This show is hysterical! I bought it for my wife as a gift and she loved it! We watch it all the time.,1356307200,,102,3.4782608695652173

4603046,5,B0058YPJ2W,"Hilarious. Not a huge fan of sitcoms these days, and also didn't watch Season 1 (as the reviews from those from many critics were poor), but they picked up for S.2 and it's obvious why. Great characters, witty dialogue, fast-paced writing. Arrested Development is another one of my favorite shows for taste comparison' sake.",1355529600,,324,5.018518518518518
4603047,5,B0058YPJ2W,I love Adam Pally! This show is soooo good. Makes me laugh all the time it is a light hearted comedy that shouldn't be missed,1355356800,,125,4.04

4603049,5,B0058YPJ2W,What a funny show. This episode is awesome! The digital services worked great. There are no complaints here. The digital file went directly to the Xbox without a single hitch. Thanks Amazon.,1351555200,,190,4.96875
4603050,5,B0058YPJ2W,"Think Friends meets Scrubs.  Humor, quirky, and clever.  There is not a better comedy on TV now.  Max is the best gay character ever created.  Jane and Brad are the perfect inter-racial couple.  Penny is adorably funny, and Alex is GORGEOUS!  Dave is the most normal, so the comedy revolves around him.  Perfect cast. Perfect chemistry.",1351382400,,336,4.892857142857143
4603051,4,B0058YPJ2W,"I am deeply disappointed. The episode ""KickBall 2: The Kickening"" is missing. The title of the DVD is misleading. However: GREAT SHOW.",1351209600,6,134,5.136363636363637
4603052,5,B0058YPJ2W,"This is the first time I have ever bothered to write a review for anything on Amazon - that's how great this show is! Each character has their own unique quirks and qualities, and there is true genuine chemistry with each and every one of them on screen. I wish I had a group of friends as tight as these guys! The writing is absolute perfection, plain and simple. So much humor, sarcasm, hilarity, and fun all rolled into a little thirty minute show. I hope this show lasts for many years to come, as it certainly deserves as much. If you haven't checked this show out yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Do it. Do it now. See what you've been missing!",1350000000,4,648,4.276422764227642

Give choice....censored for those that are ashamed of the human body, or the version that shows everything.  If those on the show are embarrassed then they shouldn't be on the show.",1505433600,,321,4.5964912280701755
8462399,5,B0058YPJ2W,"Definitely one of the best shows tv had to offer. Network television just refuses to get metropolitan 30 something's right. They can be happy to not have kids, it isn't always about growing in a career. Sometimes life and a group of amah-zing friends is plenty of great material.",1503360000,,279,4.714285714285714
