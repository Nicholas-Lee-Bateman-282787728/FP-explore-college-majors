7926689,4,B00004Y55Q,"This video is actually comprised of two films. The first is ""Fairweather"" which runs about twenty eight minutes and has some historical value. The second is ""Ascent"" which runs about eleven minutes.

The ""Fairweather"" film was shot over a quarter of a century ago by Steve Marts and is a little on the grainy side. If you are a climbing enthusiast, however, it is a film well worth having. It is shot in the Fairweather Range in Alaska, an area so remote that in order to get there you either have to get dropped off by a small plane or motor across Glacier Bay in a boat.

Four climbers chose to do just that. Steve Marts, Jim Wickwire, Alan Givler, and Dusan Jagersky made the journey. There are some magnificent scenic views with ice everywhere one looks. We are talking really remote, nearly virgin territory. There is some great footage of their approach and their ascent. With very little dialogue, it is truly a film about climbing and exploration, as they scale an unnamed, unclimbed peak.

Unfortunately, four ascend, but only two are able to complete the descent, as tragedy struck their party just shortly after their successful summit. The film is dedicated to the two who did not return. If one would like to know the details about what happened, one need only read Jim Wickwire's book, ""Addicted to Danger"".

The second segment of the video,""Ascent"", has no dialogue, and is silent but for the clink of an ice hammer on an ice screw, the crunch of crampons on ice and hard packed snow, and the sound of heavy breathing, as two climbers make there way up to an ancient, dormant volcano in the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest. The viewer sees them climb over rock and ice, as well as over snow bridges, and leap over crevasses. There are some truly great vistas to be seen.
Overall, this is a wonderful video that true climbing enthusiasts should appreciate and enjoy.",999907200,2,1882,4.659638554216867
7926690,5,B00004Y55Q,"A masterpiece of mountaineering filmmaking. In the mid-1970's, four climbers, Jim Wickwire, Dusan Jagersky, Al Givler and Steve Marts went into the heart of the remote Fairweather Range in Alaska to climb an unclimbed peak, and unnamed peak. This beautiful film, all shot by Marts on the approach, the climb, and the descent, captures what remote mountaineering and exploration by true climbers is all about. With virtually no dialog, and little narrative. It is none the less captivating, and as realistic as any climbing film ever shot. With some of the most beautiful mountain footage ever shot. But beyond that, the story of the approach and climb is presented in a dramatic, and bold manner that will hold the interest of any viewer. Of the fifty-plus video tapes or events I have on tape about climbing, Fairweather still sits at, or near, the very top, a quarter century after it was filmed.
Also on the video tape is Ascent. A short film also shot by Steve Marts. This film is a montage of great shots of two climbers in the North Cascades National Park. It contains no dialog or narrative. Just climbing, and music. As always, beautifully filmed with terrific views.
*As a side note. The story of the climb in the Fairweathers can be found in Jim Wickwire's excellent book, Addicted to Danger.",975715200,3,1302,4.816964285714286
