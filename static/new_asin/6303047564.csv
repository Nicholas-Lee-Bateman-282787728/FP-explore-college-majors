557510,5,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn is a fairy tale in the best sense of the term -- an exploration of archetypes of human existence. Featuring the voices of such talents as Angela Landsbury and Mia Farro, this film takes you on a journey ""to find others like me."" It is a tale of innocence lost and found, of the metaphysical realities of truth and self. Deep and rich, it reveals more -- and raised more questions -- with each viewing. Children will love the amusing characters. Adults will love the underlying story, and dialogue that leaves you laughing because it captures a truth you'd perhaps never thought of. ""No cat out of its first fur was ever decieved by appearances, unlike human beings, who seem to enjoy it."" The songs, flawlessly provided by America, underscore and deepen the threads of immortality, pain, and redemption. This is one movie for everyone.  END",882144000,4,857,4.751677852348993
557701,5,6303047564,"""The Last Unicorn"" was a mainstay of my childhood, a movie beloved by both me and my siblings -- we watched and re-watched it so many times that we broke the rental tape.  I've seen it so many times I can probably recite its dialogue by heart, and many of the songs are still capable of moving me to tears.  As an adult I can recognize some of the technical shortcomings of this film... but it still remains beloved to me, one of the finest animated films of the '80s and deserving of being recognized as a classic.  With lovely animation, a powerful story, and great songs, it's won a special place in my heart and in the hearts of a generation.

""The Last Unicorn"" follows -- wait for it -- a unicorn who believes herself to be the last of her kind.  She leaves her beloved forest one day in order to discover what's become of her brethren, and in the process is launched on a journey that will change her forever.  Accompanied by an inept wizard named Schmendrick and a cynical but ultimately kindhearted woman named Molly Grue, she seeks out a creature called the Red Bull that is rumored to have played a role in the disappearance of the unicorns... and her journey takes her to the castle of King Haggard.  There she will find danger, hope, and perhaps something no unicorn has ever experienced before -- love and heartbreak...

The animation in this film isn't Disney quality, but it's still well-done and exquisitely detailed.  If you're a fan of the old Bakshi-produced ""Lord of the Rings"" film or Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit,"" you'll most likely enjoy the animation of this film -- full of detail and unique character designs, fluid and smooth.  Interestingly, some of the animators from this film would go on to join Studio Ghibli, creating such classics as ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke.""  If you're a fan of Ghibli's work, I'd highly recommend watching this film as an example of the animators' early work.

The story itself is based on a novel, ""The Last Unicorn.""  While I was amazed at how closely the film followed the novel, it's not necessary to have read the novel in order to enjoy the film.  It's a melancholy yet thoughtful and lovely story, one that plays with the nature of the fairy tale and turns our expectations upside-down.  And the characters are a joy to get to know, helped along by a stellar voice cast (Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges, Tammy Grimes, Angela Lansbury, Christopher Lee, and Rene Auberjonois).

And finally, the songs of this film (by '70s rock band America) are exquisite.  The title track is by far the most famous song, but ""Man's Road"" is quite haunting and lovely as well, and ""In the Sea"" and ""That's All I've Got To Say"" are quite lovely as well.  ""Now That I'm a Woman"" is a haunting song, but Mia Farrow's vocals are, to be charitable, not the best.  I'd love to hear another singer tackle this song someday...

A beautiful animated classic, ""The Last Unicorn"" remains dear to my heart, and I hope it endures for a long time to come.  Be warned -- despite the G rating this film contains some frightening moments and even mild nudity.  Probably best for children 8 and up.",1522886400,,3141,4.5813953488372094

557703,5,6303047564,"I am one of those people who loved this movie as a kid but for me it still holds up to this day. It's not a perfect movie by any accounts, the animation swings between gorgeous and fluid and ugy and jittery at points, but is overall nice. The songs are good and unobtrusive, and aren't presented like a typical mysical, perhaps minus the one where the characters sing in the story itself. The plot is somewhat bare, stripped down from the deeper plot of the book, but its servicable for a kids move.

There are some darker parts to this movie that I think are pretty typical for films that came out in this time period. There are a few soft curse words and some parts that might scare smaller kids. The violence isn't graphic but it's not presented gently either, and there is some 'nudity'. I put that in quotes because you briefly see part of breasts on a monster character. It's not in the least bit sexual and I didn't even notice they were there until I was an adult. It's not something I think kids would even really notice, as they're mostly obscured and the movie doesn't put any particular emphasis on them.

One great thing about this movie is that you don't have to worry about there being potty humor and fart jokes every five seconds like there is in so many kids films today and there is what feels like real danger and scares as well as real beauty in the film. It's not for everyone but it's a wonderful movie that's well worth a try.",1522540800,3,1450,4.327205882352941

557707,1,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn: The Last Unicorn is an animated film adored by many that have an all-star cast and animated by Rankin Bass. It involves a unicorn that when learning she is the last of her kind embarks in a long song-filled journey to find others of her kind all while pursued by the Red Bull (not the sports drink).

The Good: The screams of grandma when she pops in the room to see her wards watching the bouncing breasts of a triple-breasted topless harpy (or god help us a well-endowed tree) in this G rated film she picked up for a dollar at Walmart.

The Bad: Full disclosure I hated this movie. The animation is sub-par and the songs are insipid. Jeff Bridges and Mia Farrow sing themselves and that seemed to be an error. The story is slow and there are severe tonal shifts throughout. Honestly, it is a hard film to get through.

In Conclusion: If you loved this film as a kid more power to you. I certainly have some films I saw at a tender age I doubt would hold up today (I am looking your way, Damnation Alley). Taken as itself away from the veil of nostalgia this is a slow moving film with poor animation, forgettable songs, and half asleep celebrity voice actors.",1521763200,,1180,4.3545454545454545

557754,3,6303047564,"""The Last Unicorn"" contains animation reflective of a variety of artistic styles: Chinese painting, European tapestries, and Art Deco (reminiscent of the work of Disney artists Earle Eyvind and Ron Dias in the ""Sleeping Beauty"" animated feature and Golden Book). These styles, while different, complement each other fairly well and create charming natural vistas (the woodland scenes being particularly lovely).

However, creating a jarring contrast to these beautiful backgrounds is the general ugliness of the people and animals in this film. True, the Japanese manga-style unicorns and some of the animals inhabiting the Last Unicorn's enchanted forest are an exception, but almost all of the other characters and ""extras"" don't seem to belong in the same world. That could've been the intent, of course, but must they be so ugly? The witch, the harpy, the king--all are repulsive, the people complete with grayish or greenish skin.

Other comments about this film:

1) The butterfly is annoying and quotes songs that most children even in the early 1980s would not have known. This scene lasts too long.
2) Because such a big deal is made about the harpy, I had expected her to return later in the film, but she never does. And why would she want to kill the unicorn who releases her from her cage?
3) Is Mommy Fortuna an actual witch or isn't she? Or is her power limited? (And is being eaten by a harpy truly her preferred way to die?)
4) Similarly, it wasn't clear to me for a while whether Schmendrick actually had power or was just a poser.  His status as a developing wizard should have been clarified from the beginning. Maybe he was supposed to be a would-be wizard who turned out to have actual powers.  Still--confusing.
5) What is Red Bull's story? This character needs some elaboration.

Reasons I won't be sending this film to my 9-year-old niece:

1) The busty tree--a disturbing, unexpected scene in what is presumably a children's film.
2) Lear's apparent willingness to love what he knows to be a unicorn.
3) A greenhorn wizard replicating the first miracle of Jesus Christ by turning water into wine. Unnecessary and disrespectful.

For the most part, I liked the music in this film, although a couple songs were pretty lame (I'm thinking of one sung by Lear, in particular). In general, this is an interesting film worth being seen at least once, although it may be worth subsequent viewings for those interested in the artistic merits of the animation.  I haven't read Peter S. Beagle's novel, so I don't know how the film and book compare.",1515110400,,2564,4.862385321100917

557758,5,6303047564,"One of my favorite books and films as a child! I'm 29 now and it still manages to capture my heart. This is suitable for children and will also appeal to adults who love fantasy (dark fantasy, too), folk tales, and underrated gems with a cult following. I'm not a huge fan of anime, and this always stood out as better quality animation. The film stays pretty true to the book. America provides some great tracks on the beautiful soundtrack. Whimsical, endearing, sad, funny, and enchanting. A true classic now and with good reason. I dressed as Amalthea one Halloween when spending the holiday with a good friend of mine, and she and I were both fangirling while getting dressed up and watching this together. So many young women I know grew up with this as well and it holds a special place in our hearts. I must say, I've encouraged some young male friends to give it a try lately and they have an appreciation for it to boot. I believe this should be among a collection of 80s gems for children, right up there with The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. ~ Rachel H.",1513382400,3,1063,4.456410256410257

557806,4,6303047564,"Review of The Last Unicorn
Hot Toasty Rag, September 17, 2017

The Last Unicorn is a Rankin and Bass cartoon I used to watch all the time when I was a kid, but as I rewatched it now as a grown-up, Im shocked that Id been able to make it through. Its scary! The animation looks very similar to The Flight of Dragons, and just as in that childhood favorite, there are very frightening mythical creatures that might frighten the little ones in the audience.

Mia Farrow voices the title character, and after she overhears a man saying shes the last unicorn on Earth, she sets out to prove him wrong and find more of her kind. Along the way, she meets a singing butterfly, voiced by Robert Keith, who channels Robin Williamss Genie character brilliantly; a magician, voiced by a tired-sounding Alan Arkin; a prince voiced by an equally tired-sounding Jeff Bridges; and an old hag, voiced by Tammy Grimes. Angela Lansbury, Christopher Lee, Rene Auberjonois, Keenan Wynn, and the legendary Paul Frees join the cast as well. There are a few songs, most of them sung in the background by America, but one of them is actually sung by Mia!

Admittedly, I am a Mia Farrow fan, but objectively shes wonderful in this movie, and not only because the cartoon unicorn actually looks like her! Shes caring, frightened, determined, hopeful, and sweet. If you missed the opening credits and didn't catch the year of release, youd swear the lead was voiced by Gwyneth PaltrowMia sounds exactly like her! They both have an affected accent and a waver in their voice; halfway through The Lost Unicorn, I found myself lost in a fantasy of a 1990s remake of The Great Gatsby planned only in my head: Gwyneth Paltrow as Daisy, Brad Pitt as Gatsby, and Beau Bridges as Nick. But I digress.

Parts of the cartoon are sad, scary, sweet, funny, or strange. But if you like your cartoons with a tinge of weirdness, like Thumbelina, Quest for Camelot, The Secret of NIMH, or The Flight of Dragons, youll probably like this one. The all-star cast is definitely worth a watch, and even if you don't completely fall in love with Mia, I guarantee youll find her extremely sweet.",1505606400,,2144,4.63421052631579

This movie really did make my childhood, it is one of the first movies I can remember as a child. I still love watching this movie every now and again even though I've probably seen it at least a hundred times.
There are a lot of things that make this movie enjoyable to watch as a whole, first off it isn't so childish that an adult would not want to watch it. The director kept the singing to a minimum for the most part, don't get me wrong I don't mind the singing but too much gets annoying and repetitive.
They put a little bit of romance in it BUT they did not do the typical ""ride away on a white horse ending"" which is admirable considering most fairytales end this way. I find it great that people actually die, I find it exhausting when in a movie nobody ever dies, that being said they also kept it ""PG"" for the kids so there was not any inappropriate violence.
Finally I love that they completely kept to the book personally I hate when they change everything in the movie. It's a great film that I hope to show my children one and I would highly recommend it.",1496448000,,1097,4.228571428571429

When I saw this I put it on more for me than for him but he was really into it! The music hooked him right away. The music is great if you haven't seen it. The animation is so beautiful and the colors and the story. I love everything about it. He loves it too so now we watch it together. The red bull parts are his favorite as he runs around the room and roars. This movie holds up even though it's older. So glad it's on prime.,1481155200,11,712,3.8835616438356166

The restoration is exquisite, the sound quality picks up sounds I never heard in my old VHS copy and has enhanced them in stereo sound. The film is widescreen too, so there is no jumping from one character to another depending on who is talking. Do not even worry about the censoring that was done in the past, it is completely gone!

This is the movie that was released the year of my birth. This is the movie that I have been watching since I was five years old, and now as a 34 year old.

558788,4,6303047564,"Heads-up for for those purchasing the ""multi-format"" version--the image for the listing is wrong! It does not currently include (or, at least, mine didn't) a digital download when purchased directly from Amazon. I've contacted Amazon three times about the discrepancy, but the issue still hasn't been resolved. I've knocked one star off for that; it's a big disappointment for me, as it affects the portability of the item.

That said, the movie itself is lovely. I'm absolutely delighted to finally have the uncut and unedited version of The Last Unicorn available on my shelf. I first saw TLU via an old VHS tape, which has since disintegrated. I've had a copy of the earlier DVD release for several years, and it was always just that little bit off. It makes the G rating on the back of the case a bit questionable, but if childhood me didn't recognize that Molly Grue was swearing, I don't think it will cause much trouble.

If you enjoy the movie, I highly recommend giving the book a go, as well!",1475366400,2,1002,4.6875

559398,2,6303047564,"I'm having a hard time fathoming why this is considered a cult classic. I found the movements of the animation clunky and unnatural. I also found the dialogue to be just as wooden and stilted. I am reminded of the phrase, good stories aren't written; they are rewritten. This plot seems very much like a first draft that could have been good, if only it were refined more. I found enduring this sloppy narrative to the very end quite unpleasant. Many of its fans seem to state that they have loved it since they were a kid. I find that odd, because I often find that re-watching movies that I enjoyed as a kid often leads to a very different experience through the eyes of an adult. Which makes me suspect sentiment lies at the heart of its cult status. Who knew that sentiment could twist our perceptions so much? Glad I am not subject to such blindness.

It has so many good quotes and ideas: There are no such things as happy endings, because nothing ever really ends. Heroes do what's right even when it's not what they want. Men never really know when they're happy, even when they get what they supposedly always wanted. You love the person you love, even if they don't love you back.

I will add as an artist the animation and backdrop paintings are gorgeous. Honestly for how detailed the landscapes are its a shame they didn't expect more out of the character and unicorn animators. I never noticed this as a child. I was also lost on the darker twists and turns of the plot. It's really an adult animation film. Not really Kent for kids.

This movie is a bit of a mixed bag for me. While the concept for the film and characters is a great idea, the execution could use some work. While some characters like the Unicorn/Amalthea and the magician Schmendrick are decently developed, other characters like King Haggard, Prince Lr, and Molly aren't developed as well as they should be. Especially in the case of Lr both in terms of his character and his relationship with Amalthea. The story says they fall in love, but it doesn't really show it happen. It just kind of happens and we're supposed to believe it. All things considered, this is a decent fantasy film with a great premise for its story and characters that while it could've been executed better, its worth at least one watch. 3 out of 5.",1463529600,,830,4.533333333333333

The artwork is stylized but beautiful & while the story remains child friendly it has a edginess to it that relates more to adult audiences.  The voice talents in this movie is certainly A-list talent, truly a all star cast!  And the musical score is as beautiful as the artwork it supports.  While this animated movie is adult friendly it is not specifically targeting a all adult audience like "" Fire & Ice"", "" Wizards"" or "" Heavy Metal""  it remains family friendly without losing its action or more cerebral storyline.  Yes there is more going on in this story than what you see at face value.  I would suggest you get this special release before the movie gets vaulted & the price goes through the roof!!!

560200,4,6303047564,"Well, this is essentially another dupe from the DVD edition, but the print is somewhat clearer.  Truth be told I didn't like the film's production values all that much to begin with.  Off shore or Japanese animation, especially from the same production house that gave us The Hobbit animated film in the 70s, just doesn't do it for me when the story calls for a company like Disney to take the helm.

Disney could have, would have, and should have done this film.  But, as it is, we have sub par Japanese animation rendering a modern western myth with voice talent that teeters between brilliant (Mia Farrow as the Unicorn in question) to questionable; Alan Arkin as a wizard?  Er, maybe if the wizard was from from mid town Manhattan, because otherwise this role needed an aged Anglophile reading the role.

I love Japanese anime.  I really do, but The Last Unicorn deserved something different, and something better, than offshore renderings.

And yet, for all that, the film has a kind of charm to it, largely due to the rendition of the unicorn itself.",1460246400,,1056,4.701086956521739

560237,1,6303047564,"I watched the whole film so as to give it a fair review. That said, I hated it. The characters were not likeable, my desire to find out what happened to the unicorns quickly faded into a loathing of all things unicorn, a travesty in and of itself, and there is so much creepy imagery it is impossible to know where to begin the criticism. I'll just sum it up this way: After finishing this movie, my mind was screaming, ""This movie was about unicorns! How could a movie about unicorns be so awful? It has Angela Lansbury for crying out loud! How could R/B make such a terrible movie after I grew up loving The Hobbit? That was such a waste of my time!"" Now my mind is screaming, ""How could so many people like this film? It's so weird and it has creepy breast imagery - totally inappropriate for kids!"" I'm sorry if this stomps on anyone's childhood nostalgia, but parents should really have higher standards for what they let their kids watch, especially if they care about creating good childhood memories. There are so many better memory-making films out there. If you value good film-making and don't mind a little creepy, watch Anastasia.",1458777600,,1143,4.553398058252427

560239,5,6303047564,"I did not see this movie before purchasing it, so this review is from a perspective of fresh eyes. I love this movie. There is no visually viewable violence for touchy parents to worry about though death does occur. The movie has somewhat of a bittersweet feel to it that can make even me tear up. Ultimately though I'd say this movie is simply inspiring, it is an experience that explores emotions, shows the value of standing strong in the face of danger, and the value of sacrificing something to do what's right.

The music of this movie is very good and works very well for transitions and breaking up scenes. The animation can be a mixed bag. On one hand the aesthetic designs are beautiful and fitting to the feel of the areas and characters. On the other hand due to the limitations of the time there are some moments which do look pretty lame.

Most of the film is definitely solid, but there are two things in It I don't care for. One character near the beginning really doesn't fit well in the movie and then there is a group of outlaws at one point who don't really serve any purpose at all except for providing Molly a way to enter the story.

This movie may have flaws but it is so beautifully crafted with strong and impactful moments and characters that I would say this is a must see for anyone who can appreciate cartoons as something more than just a babysitter.",1458259200,3,1381,4.407843137254902

561275,5,6303047564,"A timeless fantasy for both adults and children. Enough action and romance for young people to enjoy, along with a depth of philosophical and allegorical appeal to entrance older viewers. A true classic of animation by Rankin-Bass; the studio responsible for such great works as ""The Hobbit"", ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" and host of other fantasy films and specials. There is an almost spiritual and indefinable quality to Rankin-Bass and other early anime works that is rarely captured in animation today. This one succeeds in no small part thanks to a brilliant score by the rock band ""America"" lending it's poetry and eerie romanticism to Beagle's original work and R/B's expert visuals. A moral and philosophical work that at all times feels like a painting; sometimes feels like a uniquely 70's-80's experiment in adult animation, but never feels vapid, pretentious, or self-indulgent.

There are a range of themes included, from innocence, to greed; to the vanity of fame and earthly success, to remaining true to yourself and who you truly are; and overcoming challenges. ""It's a rare man who is taken for what he truly is,"" The Magician declares; seems to sum-up the ethereal quality of this film's mystery and unanswered (and perhaps unanswerable?) questions. A good film or body of work will always ask more questions of you than it answers and this one will leave you pondering it's existential themes long after you have left the theater, (or turned off your computer or TV).",1444780800,,1492,5.040485829959514

561281,3,6303047564,"I chalk it up to being more of a lover of science fiction rather than fantasy that I never saw this movie, which is considered by many to be a classic. So when I happened upon the DVD, I decided to finally give it a watch. It helped that so many famous people were providing the voices, as well as close friends singing praises about the film.

In the end, I'm a bit torn. The voice work and the animation is beautiful (some of Rankin Bass' best)...yet I can't help but think that perhaps I set my expectations a bit too high. It's not that I didn't like it...I just don't quite see why everyone makes such a big deal about it.

Based on the book by Peter Beagle, a lonely unicorn overhears from a pair of travelers that she's the last of her kind. The ageless and innocent Unicorn then leaves the safety of her enchanted forest, and sets out on a quest to find the rest of her kind--learning that a demonic red bull has chased them away to the end of the Earth. Along the way, she makes friends with a bumbling magician named Schmendrick, and a toughened woman named Molly Grue. Together, the trio makes it to the dreaded castle of King Haggard, who has the answers to where the fabled creatures have gone...and in time, the Unicorn will learn what it's truly like to feel regret, pain, despair, mortality, and love.

I'm probably going to make a lot of fans upset when I say this, and I mean no offense. If you love this movie, that's great...but...am I the only one who was seriously BORED with this movie? It clocks in at only 84 minutes, but at times, it sure as heck doesn't feel like it. I felt more like a week had gone by, by the time this thing finished. And considering I'm a fan of works such as Hayao Miyazaki's, and his ""slow and steady"" pacing in his own films, I'd like to think of myself as a pretty patient person. I think part of the problem here is with the songs. Not that they were terrible or poorly sung, just...unmemorable. They not only all sounded virtually the same, but were just so SLOW. More than once, I was half tempted to hit the fast forward button, thinking, ""okay, I get it. This person's sad--this person lost something--this person's looking for something; can we please move along?""

As for the plot, apparently, Peter Beagle also wrote the screenplay, which is a definite plus...however, it still seems like chunks of the book it was based on were left out, as there's quite a few scenes that don't lead into each other very well, or don't really go anywhere. And characters that I thought were going to play a big part in the story seemed to just be there to deliver the plot, then disappear, never to be seen again (like the two hunters, the butterfly, the harpy, the talking cat, and the group of bandits). I have yet to read the book, so hopefully, maybe it provides a better explanation. (Then again, I've come to find that a lot of ""Lord of the Rings-ish"" fantasy tends to be like this. Maybe it's just the sci-fi nerd in me who wants more explanation beyond ""it's magic--just roll with it."")

As for the main characters, they're all decent. The Unicorn can be very nave at times, but it makes sense, considering she's never left her forest before. Her romance with Haggard's son is kind of rushed, though. She barely speaks to him, and we're told she constantly turns down his advances, yet a scene later, they share one song, and then suddenly, they're in love. (I'm not asking for a three hour epic--just an extra scene or two would've been nice.) Schmendrick was likeable, although he could be a bit wooden at times (both in the animation and voice acting)--when the Red Bull shows up, he can only seem to muster a look of dull surprise. Haggard was an interesting villain--being both selfish, but also sympathetic in that he tried and failed to find true happiness (and Christopher Lee's amazing vocal performance helped). Honestly, the best character was Molly Grue--a withered woman who nearly gave up fairy tales, and finds her dreams renewed when she makes friends with the Unicorn. Her speech to the Unicorn when she first meets her is both memorable and a tear jerker.

All n' all, I thought the film was just okay. I'm glad I watched it, although I can't quite see why everyone seems to tout it as the greatest thing ever. Some characters were great--others could've used more attention. And the plot dragged in a few parts, while in others, it went too fast. At least the animation was pretty to look at. If your kids are patient, then yes, I would recommend this...it just wasn't my kind of movie, I guess. Maybe I'm just too sci-fi oriented to fully appreciate it.",1444262400,,4626,4.481613285883748

I know the movie was created in the early eighties, and thus the choice of music can be forgiven. But the godawful mixing, the terrible score, the unforgivable sound effects....all add up to an experience that bordered on making my ears bleed, and only succeeded in giving me a headache.
Next, the visuals.
The animation and artwork were passable...at best. This was clearly from a studio not versed in the art form and it showed.
Sure, the early Disney films can look a bit dated now compared to modern films, but that's what hand drawn vs CAD gives you. I actually really love hand drawn stuff. When it's done right.
But that's no excuse for poor art work, and that's what was on display in this movie. Bad animation, and bad art.
Now...lets just talk for a moment about the content.
Not knowing what to expect, but seeing the G rating - and yeah, I suspected there might be a few questionable elements in it, being from a different era - I was stunned to see what passed for G. From a tree with massive breasts, to a very frightening harpy with engorged boobs and red nipples. I won't even go into the subliminal art in the backgrounds, with agonized faces, or how disturbing things got with a chittering skeleton wailing over wine.
This is simply NOT content I consider appropriate for kids under 10...of which there were four of in our living room just now.
I honestly have no idea what folks actually enjoyed in this particular film.

What I can say is that the story was the one element that has the potential to be something truly beautiful.
Perhaps someday someone will make an updated version of this that's worthy of watching.
I could care less about a couple swear words that were pointlessly included in the script - though to be honest they added nothing to the purpose of the dialogue and are yet one more example of an extremely poorly produced movie.

For now - if you've got young kids interested in unicorns....skip this. You'll be glad you did.
I'd suggest sticking with My Little Pony.",1441497600,,2232,4.51980198019802

561619,4,6303047564,"I cannot count on ten hands how many times my daughter wants to watch a movie which I am sure within five minutes is going to be awful. As parents we endure them in an effort to spend time with our children but in many cases I ask her to try and find something we can both enjoy. To my irritation she chose this the other night and I immediately assumed, due to its title that this would be as good as any sissy movie about fantasy creatures I ever saw. While watching the opening credits however I was astonished to find out that many famous actors had voiced the cartoon, which was made in 1982. Jeff Bridges, whose movies I will watch as a matter of principal due to the Big Lebowski as well as Christopher Lee whom I follow for scary voice purposes were two of the a listers.
  This is no, unicorn frolicking in the woods movie after all, the main protagonist discovers that she made be the last unicorn by conversing with a gnome like butterfly and goes on a journey to discover the truth of it all. Along the way she is captured alongside many other fantasy creatures including a harpy, which appears as a large condor that has sagging bosoms inappropriate enough for a child who could notice them. Ultimately freed by a wizard she continues only to find an evil King has captured all the Unicorns. The King, who has in his service a large flaming red bull knows only one happiness, and apparently that is watching immortal horse like creatures splash around in the ocean around his house eternally, kept in their place by his flaming bull. This movie proved to be deceiving to me at face value, not to say that the cover art doesn't look somewhat frightening. It may be to mature in some cases and likely scary in many others for children to really enjoy, so it wouldn't be the first thing I would choose for family night. If your child is not especially frightened by spooky animals and watching unicorns be tortured by waves, then this is actually a way better movie than I would have given it credit for. Just be careful of the Tree who also displays discernible parts of the female body.
 Classic Rock band America, who is well known for their harmonizing does the overture for the movie. The music is not only beautiful, but it serves a great purpose start to finish. For a movie that was made in 1982 the animation is very good and there is humor interwoven throughout. This movie should probably be rated PG as it is somewhat dark in nature for children that have a higher understanding.  Surprisingly impressed overall.",1441065600,,2534,4.478354978354979
561620,5,6303047564,"Definitely a classic of American animation, and one which you should dig up and view. Sure it's a bit music-heavy, but the remastered graphics and audio make up for it if that's not your preference. Personally, I was very surprised to find a Blu-Ray and remastered version of this classic, so when I did it made my wife very happy as this was her favorite from her childhood.",1441065600,,375,4.529411764705882

When I introduced it to my daughter, she watched it every day for months.  Now, we make it an annual thing to watch it together.
The storyline is probably a bit mature for really young kids and the animation is not the ""typical"" you see regularly, but that is why I loved it.

562099,5,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn is possibly a film that I will remember for many years to come. My mom had recorded it onto a VHS tape for me and my two siblings; we almost wore it out. I suppose the reason I love it so much is not just because of the gorgeous imagery or the beautiful songs by America. It has to be because of the story: a beautiful unicorn goes in search of her ""lost"" companions because she thinks she is the last. Along the way she meets a bumbling wizard, a high spirited washerwoman, a heroic Prince, and the malevolent king who may be the key as to where the unicorns are. I'm not going to say too much else so that way you're not spoiled.
The voice work for this movie has always stood out to me possibly because of who it is that voices these characters. Alan Arkin does a wonderful job as Schmendrick the wizard, while Tammy Grimes is wonderful as Molly Grue. However one performance from this film that has stood out to me is that of King Haggard voiced by the late Sir Christopher Lee. In fact Lee would later say in interviews that King Haggard was one of his favorite roles. He even went on the voice Haggard in the German dub of the movie. Then you have Jeff Bridges as the voice of the prince and even sings a song at one point. Then there is Mia Farrow as the voice of the title character; your heart can't help but melt at her performance.
If you have had the chance to read Peter S. Beagle's book, then you should add this movie to your collection.",1436227200,,1469,4.176056338028169

The way this edition was advertised, I and many others were expecting the theatrical/HBO version, which has never before been released on VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray due to copyright issues. I was so excited! Finally, the version of the film I watched as a child when my parents taped it off HBO! I was devastated when, after buying this edition and settling down to watch it, I quickly realized it was NOT, in fact, the theatrical/HBO version. The film has been beautifully restored, the mild swearing that was cut in previous releases has been left in this time, and the bonus features are fantastic, but I wish they'd clarified that this edition was NOT the original. I continue to wait, along with thousands of other Last Unicorn fans, for the copyright issues surrounding the original edition to be resolved so that someday, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, I will be able to see my favorite childhood movie in all its original glory.",1434672000,3,1020,4.8342857142857145

563212,4,6303047564,"i love this movie, though there are some questionable scenes for those that are Religious, or are a sensitive family, 1.  the ""Red bull"" is fiery all around him, so it makes one wonder if it's based on the devil maybe, 2. the harpy creature is really weird looking, it's a female and will show bird breast's it's ugly, and it tempts the unicorn into setting ""her"" free from the cage that her and rest are in, and saying, ""we are sisters you & i"" it's like WTF??? lol anyway, it has a grey beard also, theres a scene but not clearly shown that the darn thing attacks & eats the other guy, & the hag that pretty much says, ""You could never have freed yourself alone, i held you."" (the way she says it too is madness, she does look pleased to be attacked by the creature & later the unicorn says, ""She chose her death long ago, it was the fate she wanted."" stupid old hag anyway the rest of the movie is fantastic there is how ever an old man played by dun dun dun.. the guy who played Saruman (& i just noticed).. Mister sir lol Christopher Lee. yay!. anyway his old man role is weird, he looks like he could be older then a zombie, (not really), he has a white unibrow,.. and hair, & his skin tone is weird, he has a stupid reason to live forever, he uses the bull to attract the uni's into the sea.. yup thats how you  feel young.. who ever told this nut case that.. bah! ok another ''issue'' is that when the unicorn turns into a beautiful anime animated female, IE white hair creamy colored with violet eyes she is naked but her long flowing hair covers her butt, (& all over front areas), but when she gets transformed back before the ending it clearly shows her changing back and she's naked but no ..""tid bits"" are shown.. there's a Chinese dragon shown and the prince kills it but it's not shown but lady Amalthea (her human name so the king doesn't suspect she's a unicorn clever, not!) isn't too pleased, there's a talking cat with an eye patch and talks like a pirate (he says, ""yar"" & stuff..) at one point he moves his eye patch to the other side of his eye,.. (i don't see the problem with either of them), there's a skeleton thats laying over an old fire place, since he used to be alive he get's tempted when the wiz guy says he'll turn water into whine, it happens, but the bottle is empty, but the Skeleton says he ""remembers"" whine drinks the bottle and red is shown across his face meaning he got drunk. hahaha now thats funnier then turning water into whine, Mr. drunk Skeleton. XD i don't know the Band America, just on this, ok another not so weird thing is when the Wizard, says.. something about books written by rabbits it's a cute quote but makes little sense oh oh! um, at one point the wizard guy turns a tree (ok so he's tied up to it as punishment cause he's a magical being he gets captured by some road bandits and if you watch that scene it'll make more sense..) at one point it turns int what looks to be an old lady tree with biiig.. boobs so wrong and yet so funny anyway noises are heard meaning it could be the sound effects from her bust's again super weird anyway, love unicorns, peg's.. i hope they make a sequel with those in it, got my own story about it, hmm the unicorns' do all look alike, you can't tell there gender period, so,.. & it's never mentioned.. we can tell only one's female & thats the lead role that goes into the world to look for the genderless beast's the opening i do adore though i love how her story is kinda told by different ways, in a painting, in a cloud form, i like the cloud version of her, so mystical the butterfly makes less sense cause he's singing some random junk. and makes poems etc etc, & at one point though he is helpful in giving her info on where her fellow uni's are, so other then that it's enchanting and. she is half mortal at the & so i wonder how her life's going to be, will she be misjudged? by the other clones? ok the only thing uncensored about it is sometimes the characters will say the D word, i have the censored version & it still shows the the unicorn transform kinda like the Sailor moon thing the animation on the title is nice, but she doesn't have blue hair, look up the original.",1431820800,6,4186,4.211706102117061

563453,4,6303047564,"I am a fan of Rankin-Bass films in general, because of their emphasis on creating works of art that focus on storytelling instead of special effects and selling action figures.  Back then, a film was just a film, not the beginning of a merchandising scheme.  I appreciate that about them.

However, this one is not my favorite.  It's a bit too bleak, dark, and sad, with not enough wonderment.  It seems like everyone in this world knows all about unicorns and magic, and thus, they're barely special, except that they've gone extinct.

Also, as a kid, I remember being a little put-off by the D-bomb in this film.  Watching decades later a parent, I was still put-off by it.  Then again, the Secret of NIMH has one too.  I suppose one can't shield one's children's ears forever, if one wants to expose them to all the old ""classic"" cartoons.  And I suppose I'd prefer they watch a morality tale like this with a D-bomb in it, as opposed to the inane and perpetual cartoon violence of, say, Tom and Jerry soullessly hacking at one another with axes and anvils.

To its credit, it has all the elements for a good fantasy/adventure film; a sympathetic protagonist, a quest, a comic relief character, an arch nemesis, a love interest, and a few force-of-nature foils (the harpy and the red bull) that must be survived or reckoned with.

On one hand, the story appears to be aimed at older children.  Much of the dialogue and plot is too complicated for a toddler or pre-schooler to follow 100%.  Yet, on the other hand, the plot is so thin in spots, and the characters so caricatured, that it was often difficult for me to watch.  I can't help but feel that older children, capable of critical thinking, would begin to ridicule the behavior of many of the characters and the obviously implausible plot sequences.  That leaves a very narrow age/maturity range as its ideal target audience.

Will we ever watch this again?  Probably, because it's available on Prime, and is different than the flashy, gimmicky toy-selling animations of the modern age.  It stands out because it has soul and depth of feeling that Dora the Explorer will never achieve.  I want to be moved by stories, and I want my kids to feel that too.  As flawed as the storyline might seem to me, The Last Unicorn achieves the basic goal of telling a story and evoking some sort of empathetic, emotional response.  I can recommend watching it at least once for that reason alone.",1431388800,,2443,4.632558139534884

The voice actors are first rate:  Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow, Angela Landsbury, and Christopher Lee... so that's cool.  (The children's book is neat also).

If you like dated animation of a children's book with neat acting voices try it out.  Otherwise it's your time could be better spent.

565500,5,6303047564,"I watched this with my 6 year old son and he really enjoyed it!  It was ""my turn"" to pick a movie and although some people might think about unicorns and think of girls, I know he secretly likes some ""girl only"" things like unicorns, so I picked it unsure of what he would think.  He liked the unicorn and said she was pretty, etc, and watched it all the way to the end.  There are a lot of scenes where they talk for long periods of time and I think those parts are where he got a little uninterested.  For the most part though, he seemed to enjoy it.

A heads up to parents: There is a harpy (A bird) in the movie who has breasts that are clearly visible, along with nipples.  It made me feel a little awkward, but he didn't say anything about it so I guess he didn't notice.  There are scenes where a girl is shown naked, but no body parts are shown because her hair covers the details.  It's clear that she is naked though and the movie allows parents to explain why the girl is naked.",1425945600,,989,4.061855670103093

565885,5,6303047564,It's an old movie and part of the reason I love it is because of the sentimental attachment to the movie from my childhood. The belief in magic in the world and not changing oneself simply to appease others appeals to me as some of the themes of this movie. But also it does promote an elitist attitude that suggests that by birth some should serve and others should be served. Maybe I'm just reading too much into what is really just an old animated movie with a soundtrack by America that I love singing along too.,1424736000,,516,4.329896907216495

565887,5,6303047564,"The last unicorn is blessed with wonderful performances by Mia Farrow, Jeff Britches, and a unforgettable Christopher Lee, in a role I will associate to his voice more than saruman or count dooku. On top of these blessings is a wonderful soundtrack that captures the flowy animation and faded coloring that seems to permeate with 70s fantasy appeal.

The movie isn't perfect however, and having never read the novel, I can't imagine that any writer, given enough time and no real reason to limit himself, would have resolved the final 20 minutes of the movie the way this one has. The last unicorn, building wonderful lore and characters you can really appreciate, seems to forego storytelling to wrap itself up at the end. Venturing perilously close to the 4th wall, the characters move from behaving with distinct motivation to behaving in ways that stress that they are to fit into garden variety knights and dragons stories by doing little more than announcing ""I'm this character, so I must do XYZ because, REASONS!"". Needless to say, I was not convinced.

But don't let that ruin the experience for you or your children. The story is a fantasy every young person can fall in love with as it is a great prelude to other epic quests. Light on action, heavy on lore, the mere watching of The Last Unicorn as a child was a sobering experience for me as though graduating from cartoon violence good guy wins, bad guy loses cornucopia, into a world where evil is mitigated by great sorrow and good by frigid indifference.

PS. Haggards speech to the lady Amalthia is so powerful, I'm sure its recited in theater classes around the world. If it is not as ubiquitous as Amazing Grace in a singing rehearsal, than the world is a more dumberer place than I thought.",1424649600,3,1761,4.711038961038961

566421,4,6303047564,"This is one of those animated movies that has been forgotten by a majority of people.  I saw it in the theaters when I was a little kid, and there is something about the story and the animated adaptation of it that just haunts you.  Of course, as a kid, I did not get a lot of things in it, I was just interested in a cartoon movie and the unicorn itself.  While I was never much of a fan of the fantasy genre (things having to do with magic, fairy tale creatures, etc.) and more of a sci-fi realist and remain as such, this movie was a truly great example of what fantasy fiction should be.  The characters and story are complicated with multiple layers and able to change themselves into a variety of situations.  This was part of a time in the 1980s when many who were making fantasy films favored a darker tale rather than the sanitized Disney versions that we are used to seeing today (ex. The Dark Crystal).  They made an impression, to be sure, but audiences wanted a cheerful story rather than something with a sad ending.

A unicorn in the forest is visited by two hunters on horseback and one of the hunters shouts out to the unicorn that if she is there in the forest that remains in eternal summer, to be mindful that she is the last of her kind.  Shocked to hear this, the unicorn leaves her forest to find out the truth and if she really is the only unicorn there is.  She discovers on the way that a mythical creature, The Red Bull, rounded up all the unicorns in the world and chased them into the sea years ago (all but her).  She is joined by a bumbling magician Schmendrick and a serving wench Molly who are the only ones who can see that she is actually a unicorn and not a horse (how everyone else sees her).  Eventually as they come closer to the sea where the Red Bull had chased all the unicorns into, the magician turns the unicorn into a human woman to avoid her also being chased into the sea.  They come closer to the dark and mysterious castle where the bull came from, to find a dark and mysterious king and his adopted son the prince and uncover the secret of why the king ordered the bull to round up all the unicorns.

Something about this really got to me today when I watched this again for the first time in many years.  Once the unicorn was changed into a woman, the Lady Amalthia, she said a few things that made me cry.  She asks Molly who she is and why she is here, I am forgetting who I am and why I am here.  I think it's an analogy to loosing your innocence as a child and loneliness.  ""Now that I'm a woman, everything has changed.""  There are scenes very hard to watch as an adult, like when Molly sees the unicorn for the first time.  She becomes angry with the unicorn, saying to her I had always wanted to see a unicorn and you come to me now when I am what I am today instead of one of those innocent young maidens they always come to.  And all the unicorn can say to her is ""I'm here now.""  I'm sitting here crying writing this.  And the Prince Lir and she fall in love, and it can never be because she's really a unicorn.  (In the 25th anniversary edition the new singing on the part of Lady Amalthia is bad, it was better in the first editions.)  If that doesn't hurt you, nothing will.  Now she knows what love and regret is, a part of her knows mortal feelings, and part of her will love the prince still.  She even tells him when she is human that her wish is to marry the prince and live happily ever after, but he says no, that he is a hero and knows that if and when it's time for something to be done or not, and this was one of those not times.  I guess as an adult that hurts more when you didn't understand it as a kid.  There is a difference between being alone and loneliness, as well as not knowing what you have until it's gone.  We don't have to see what is before us, and sometimes we really don't, and there is nothing magical about that.

Where this movie falls flat is that it hasn't held up well over time.  Granted, the original story was written in 1968 and the movie made in 1982.  I think the trouble with fantasy adaptations be they animated or live action (LOTR) is that the characters and situations have so many sides to them and that it's difficult to capture that in any single telling.  Granted, the story itself is rather odd, to be sure, and it also failed to catch any pop culture references with sayings that withstood in our speech lexicon or toys, so it was quickly forgotten.  Also, the darkness aspect of the original fairy tales and legendary stories has long been taken out of them for the benefit of children's understanding and entertainment.  Even today, we care to overlook the darkness of them.  The darkness was meant to teach a lesson that life is not always perfect and pretty, as adults we are to learn this.  This story has a lot of darkness in it, no question, and at some point this movie lost its audience in favor of the more Disney counterparts.  And perhaps the thing that made this ultimately fail is the fact that this is unrequited love between the unicorn/woman and the prince.  As we know as adults just because you love one another, it doesn't always work.  Love is a complicated thing and you don't always live happily ever after.

And the animation is very good, especially for the time it was in (early 1980s before so many changes in technology and anime from Japan came to us in full force).  The soundtrack is good, even with the sort of cheesiness of America.",1420156800,,5482,4.241811175337187

566652,4,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn is certainly a beautiful movie, and at its best, it truly sparkles. The animation of the unicorn is smooth and delicate, and the voice acting and story are top notch, featuring talents like Christopher Lee and Angela Lansbury. The songs by America fit the movie well. The villain, while despicable, is quite relatable; we've all done selfish things because they make us happy, just not at as large a scale. For all its good points however, the movie has flaws. The entire sequence with the butterfly is mind-numbingly awful; whimsical speech is wonderful on paper, but in film, with a voice to accompany it, it's another story. To me the butterfly seems like the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland on crack, spouting annoyances left and right. Mia Farrow's singing could've used some work. My entire family had to cover our ears when she began to sing ""Now That I'm A Woman"". Also, the relationship between the unicorn and the Prince is so forced it makes me cringe. Other than those minor (or major, in the butterfly's case) grievances, the movie holds up well as a fantasy movie anyone can enjoy, no matter their age.
At the point of writing this review, I have seen both DVD versions of this movie. The original, is simply the movie in its original state. However, the quality is quite bad, almost like they directly transferred a VHS copy of the movie to disc. The 25th Anniversary edition of the DVD (this is the DVD they bundle in with the Blu-ray which I have yet to see) has remastered visuals and is quite lovely, (the white unicorn could've been cleaned up better due to flickering, but it's still a far cry better) but it's censored. This is entirely unacceptable to me, especially since the only things they removed were the uses of the words ""damn"" and ""hell"" (all three uses of them (""damn"" twice, ""hell"" once), that was soooo necessary, wasn't it...). Any censoring of the creator's original vision in the case of entertainment should be outlawed. It's not as bad as 4Kids' One Piece censoring, but still...
Overall this movie is a classic, and should be watched by anyone who loves fantastic animation and enchanting fairytales. My personal suggestion is to get the Blu-ray. It's completely uncensored and I hear the restoration is excellent.

Edit: I changed my mind about the singing. While not perfect, Farrow's singing isn't completely awful, and it's not enough to pull you out of the experience. The butterfly on the other hand...

Edit - 10/14/15:  Just finished watching the new Enchanted Edition today. The new transfer on this version is gorgeous. They basically scrubbed out all of the film grain from the video. I'm usually not a fan of this practice, but whatever they did makes the unicorn hardly flicker at all, something all the other versions had problems with. Also, the movie in this version is completely uncensored! I highly recommend this new edition over all of the others. I haven't seen the Blu-ray version of it yet, but I imagine it's spectacular.",1417651200,2,3009,4.805019305019305

566959,5,6303047564,"I love the uncensored, original version of this film. What can I say, I'm obssessed with the novel, graphic novel, and movie adaptation. Mia Farrow's vocals for the original ""Now that I'm A Woman"" are perfect just the way they are. Although Ms. Ivring can sing up a storm, I felt like Farrow's slightly shaky voice added the emotion to the Lady Amalthea's confusion as she starts to really become human and starts forgetting things. This movie brings me to tears, if only they made animated movies like this now. If there is an animated movie out there even close to this quality please let me know. It's different from Disney, which made me love it even more. Forget Frozen, ""Love is an Open Door"" is nothing compared to the duet between Prince Lir and Amalthea in ""That's All I Got to Say"" I don't want to spoil this movie for those poor deprived people who haven't seen this movie.

Version: Uncut.  For a long time, our primary VHS copy was a cut copy played on HBO back in the 80s. If you were looking for a similar version (which removes some of the Butterfly's babbling, Mia Farrow's questionable singing of ""Now That I'm a Woman,"" and a few lines from America's ""Where Do Unicorns Go?"" among other things), this did not remove any of that.  This seems to be the standard.

Content: Censored.  The DVD removes Ruhk's ""hell"" from ""What in hell is there to stop for?"" and Molly's ""damn"" from ""Damn you, where have you been??""  There is no option to switch to the full, uncensored audio for the DVD.  Note, again, I must state this is just the DVD in the combo pack.

Audio: Correctly Pitched.  Some early versions of the DVD (standalone version) used PAL masters, which when converted to NTSC caused the pitch to be too high and the movie to play too fast.  I'm pleased to discover that issue is not present in this DVD.

Video: Noisy, visible artifacts.  Besides the censorship, this is what bothers me most about the DVD. It seems rather compressed. I'm hoping the Blu-ray disc has better video quality.  This may not be as big an issue on some TVs, but when played on a quality computer monitor these artifacts become unhappily noticeable, and the main reason I only give this 3 stars so far. If the Blu-ray checks out video-wise, I'll bump this up to a 4.",1400025600,3,1490,4.4338235294117645

Lovely art work and terribly amazing VO work from the B list (at the time A list) acting vault.  It was sooo bad and good that I could not turn away.  Meanwhile, my five year old daughter now wants to be a unicorn.  Perhaps a bit dark for the young ones below six.  Enjoy this wonderfully aged relic with a medicinal brownie if you dare.  Heck, enjoy it with a diet Coke and you will think you are eating medical brownies.  It is that good!  To clarify, when I say horrible and terrible, I am referring to the bellbottom jeans this movie makes me feel I am wearing and not the actual movie. ;)

My humor aside, it really is a lovely and nostalgic trip back to your childhood.  It magically evokes a time and place both in our own human world and in the cartoons mythical world that lingers with you long after you watch it.  It is a perfect image of the time it was created. Put it in a time capsule and it will bring the 1970's back in mirror image for its other worldly viewer 300 years from now.  Enjoy!",1399766400,2,1122,4.186915887850467

I popped the DVD into my computer today and it played just fine. The DVD is the 25th Anniversary edition, but the Blu Ray does have the original with those 2 wonderful instances of profanity that were conspicuously absent from the 25th Anniversary edition. A little colorful language never hurt anyone.
In fact, that's the only reason I bought this version, because I wanted my profanity back. I gave away my old DVD copy of the original when I got the 25th Anniversary and my jaw about hit the floor when I realized the new and improved version was CENSORED! HARUMPH!

A movie I brought for my nieces when the dvd was released,a movie I watched many times so long ago,with my sister. The Last Unicorn. Old style animation,that looks like a cross between the Lord of the Rings(animated trilogy)and Star Blazers,set in a world of talking animals,fantasy creatures,skeletons and magic. This movie,once I settled in,was renewed trip down memory lane. Filling in the blanks of whole sections forgotten(almost everything before the transformation..lol).Clocking in somewhere around 35 yrs .This is a fantasy not unlike a very old Disney movie ,a lesson or two,songs,love,and in its own way a happy ending. A  couple of brief language moments, very quick nudity shots ,and few images littler kids may find scary,makes this more inline with a older ""G""-maybe to some ""PG"" might be more fitting. Rounding this movie up from a 3.5 just because I made it through my own late night showing: too my surprise ..So go ahead :Enjoy ,The story  of a unicorn : Who leaves her forest in search for others of her kind. Upon being told she is the last,by a wondering butterfly. After she is captured ,she is befriended by a bumbling  magician .upon there escape ,he joins her on her quest to find the rest of her kind.

It was definitely very 80s, and also very japanese, but sadly the animation wasn't quite up to the level I had remembered it as being. More like He-Man, sort of jerky and stationary, rather than a nice fluid cartoon. Still, the voice talent is great and it's still a lot of fun.",1392768000,,403,4.113924050632911

Would make a great drinking game. Best scenes:

1. Talk with the obviously gay butterfly.
2. Stuck in between the boobs of the tree lady
3. Turned into a naked girl (what are the odds??)
4. Douchebag prince singing slow song followed by make out session with girl/unicorn
5. Unicorn flying in the sky
6. Skeleton getting wasted.
7. Mad king has a fettish for unicorns.
8. Swimming unicorns in a wave
9 ""Im gonna kill you if you don't do something"" - prince douche
10. Saying goodbye to his first love - the unicorn

""What am I? A unicorn or a human"" - what's her face said ''

568425,5,6303047564,"What the heck did they do to my movie!  I took it out of its shiny new wrapper today, fresh from a big box store (because that was the only place I've seen it), popped it into the player, and saw my whole life just destroyed.  Ok, so maybe I'm being dramatic, but why'd they have to change a good thing?

Ok, I don't normally do this, but I have to talk about this particular edition of The Last Unicorn before I actually review the movie itself.  This is the 25th Anniversary Edition that I watched.  Numerous scenes were cut out, they edited out the curse words (of which there were not many), and the sound quality was different.  It didn't have as much depth and all the tones were higher.  It just wasn't the same and I'm going to be seeking out some way to get the original and getting rid of the crap copy I have now.  And I just looked up about the audio, turns out I'm not crazy, the movie evidently plays faster than the original version which results in the higher voices.

So let's talk about the movie itself, the original as I remember it.  And we'll just pretend this particular copy I watched today was the whole thing.  The Last Unicorn is about the last unicorn in the world.  She is happily living in her forest not realizing she is the last until she overhears some people talking.  Which makes her think she needs to find out what happened to the rest of the Unicorns.  And so begins an adventure that is filled with harrowing encounters, a prince, an evil King, and many other wonderful and creepy things.

Characters:
Mia Farrow: Unicorn
Alan Arkin: Schmendrick the Magician
Jeff Bridges: Prince Lir
Tammy Grimes: Molly Grue
Robert Klein: Butterfly
Angela Lansbury: Mommy Fortuna
Christopher Lee: King Haggard

Since these are voice actors I can't say that they were exceptional or dreadful.  They just voice the characters and you don't think much about them.  But the characters themselves are wonderfully created.  The Unicorn is distant but lovable, and she evolves over the movie.  Schmendrick is funny but good hearted and although it's hard to see him struggle sometimes, he genuinely wants to do the best he can.  And Molly Grue, she's always been my favorite.  Sure, she's a little flighty but I think she's the heart of the whole film, even if she doesn't play a large part.

Most fantasy films are about a quest.  This one is no different.  The characters are all looking for something.  And there are of course bad guys to get in the way.  But this is so charming and the characters unique, that it feels new.  And I'm not just saying that because of the nostalgia it fills me with.  I've always loved this movie.  And I think it's because it appeals to audiences of all ages.  You see rage, anger, and anguish; which are not commonly seen in animated movies much (outside of anime that is).  But there's also hope and the drive to do good.  Lots of good lessons all packed into a colorful package.

Most people will say that the audio and animation isn't that great in the movie.  They'd probably be right to a point.  But it was made in the 80's, so I think it was pretty well done for that time.  I liked the music and the custom made songs and they even pop into my head at random times.  And I can remember nearly every word.  I can't even do that with some of the Disney movies.  The Unicorn is beautifully drawn and I loved the way all the animals were animated.  They were definitely cartoons, but they were elegant cartoons.

This is a wonderful movie, provided you get the right edition.  It's one that deserves a permanent place on the shelf and can be watched over and over again.

This particular DVD is a little disappointing, mostly because of lack of special features. With a 25th anniversary edition, I expected to receive a little more than just the basic film.

568562,5,6303047564,"I loved this movie, especially the climax. When Schmendrick succeeded in changing Amalthea from her human form back into a unicorn to fight the red bull, it felt exciting. In addition, when the giant wave rushed in, it freed the unicorns captured by King Haggard which resulted in a unicorn stampede that caused the castle to collapse and King Haggard to fall to his death. That same wave also extinguished the red bull. Those moments in the film really took me back. The part that really touched me was the unicorn reviving Prince Lr, who was attacked by the red bull earlier in the film. I'd recommend this movie!",1379376000,,615,4.651376146788991

Okay, so... the above gives you the basic premise.  I don't want to spoil the movie for you, so I won't include any specifics from here on out.  I will say that the animation quality is more than sufficient, the songs are pretty good, and with the exception of ONE voice-actor's singing voice, the voice acting is pretty good.

But that's not why I've rated this movie five stars.  I might say I've rated this movie five stars because it is a dark, serious cartoon with some very deep messages driving it.  One might conclude I've given it five stars because the character-development is phenomenal -- because even an eternal being like our main protagonist (the unicorn) finds herself swayed by the events that she encountered on her journey.

The real reason I give it five stars is because this movie hit the nail on the head for me in one specific, very moving scene.  Our protagonist meets her first travel companion fairly early in the film, but it's the point where the second traveling companion finally sees the unicorn for the first time that moved me so.  With my fantasy-oriented imagination, it was very easy for me to relate to that character's feelings across age and gender differences.  You'll know the scene and the character when it happens.  Every second of it is beautiful, and even if you HATE the rest of the movie you should watch it at least once for that one scene.",1377129600,,1658,4.583050847457627

568932,4,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn is a Japanese-American fantasy animated film. It is drawn and animated in Japan, but it is an American film. The movie is from 1982, and it is based on the novel by Peter S. Beagle.

The film is about a female unicorn named Amalthea. She overhears two men saying that she is the only unicorn left in the world. She is confused by this, since unicorns are immortal. She is also angry about the fact that humans cannot see her horn, and believe that she is simply a horse. When Amalthea meets a butterfly, he tells her that a monster called The Red Bull drove the unicorns away somewhere. She is later captured by a witch, but the witch's servant named Schmendrick saves her, and they meet a woman named Molly. After Amalthea comes across the Red Bull, Shmendrick transforms Amalthea into a human. The rest of the film involves Amalthea, Shmendrick, and Molly trying to find a way to save the captured unicorns, and bring Amalthea back to her normal form.

The movie is well written and it has sophisticated dialogue and good voice acting. The characters are interesting, and the animation is really unique. I liked the style of this movie. It's really different.",1374364800,,1178,4.631578947368421

569310,4,6303047564,"This movie is one of the few adaptations of a novel that has kept true to the book but also become an independent cult hit. The movie stays pretty close to the book. While it has to cut out content due to length, what content it has is largely driven from the book. In fact, many lines are taken directly from the novel (indeed, Peter S. Beagle himself wrote the screenplay).

The animation generally supports the story. It's a bit comical, but also can be dark or odd, as required by the story. However, in a few places the animation shows its age. In particular, some of the people are drawn to odd extremes. Captain Cully looks like a Hobbit, not a human. Some of the humans are abnormally thin.

569409,5,6303047564,"First off, the exquisite animation of Rankin & Bass' ""the Last Unicorn"" was splendid for its time and still looks wonderful to these eyes today.  Also, it's a small world:  the beautiful animation production was done by the Japanese animation studio which was known as Top Craft, which also did the animation for Rankin & Bass' the Hobbit (1977) and the Return of the King (1980).  After the Last Unicorn (1982) the Top Craft Studio staff was hired for a domestic animation project in Japan that would later become Hayao Miyazaki's incredible feature film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausicaa-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/dp/B0001XAPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>&nbsp;(1984). And after that, the staff of Top Craft was then incorporated into Studio Ghibli -- one of the most highly regarded and finest animation studios in the world.

When it was first released back in 1982, I saw the Last Unicorn in a theater. I remember the audience's response in the theater: the adoration was genuine throughout the screening of the film. I also recall the critic's highly positive reviews in the newspapers at that time.

Peter S. Beagle's screenplay adaption of his original novel is simply astonishing. It was one of the most unusual and also one of the finest screenplays for an animated film that I had ever seen, and very unusual for a single American scriptwriter (for a 2d animated film anyway, until Brad Bird's 3D film 'the Incredibles' and 'ratatouille' for Pixar. 'Nausicaa of the Valley Wind' is a film adaption of Hayao Miyazaki's comic book.) Beagle's screenplay is an adaption of his book--and a fine and beautiful adaption it is!

Although the script is excellent, there are a couple of weak moments in 'the Last Unicorn' and it comes at a point near the final act in the film: there seems to be too many song interruptions, sometimes slowing or breaking the forward rhythm and momentum of the story. If sent to the cutting room floor back before its release in the early 80s, a couple of the songs probably would not have been missed.

Other than that, the Last Unicorn is a rare literate-animation-cinema treat.

Other interesting and different animation film experiences you might enjoy: 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron', 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', 'the Secret world of Arrietty', and 'Watership down'.

569413,5,6303047564,"I first watched The last Unicorn when I was a child in the early/mid 90s. I am now an adult and it still remains to be my all-time favorite animated movie (with The little Mermaid by Hans Christensen and The Swan Princess coming in as a close second). I watched it many times on my old VHS tape, and it always left me feeling spellbound. When my VHS tape broke, I was heart-broken. So when it came out on DVD, I was extremely delighted! I am a huge kid at heart, and have watched many animated movies throughout my life, but none had the same indelible effect as The Last Unicorn. It stood the test of time for a reason.

This is a heart-rending, beautiful story about an ethereal unicorn who thinks she's the last of her kind when she overhears two hunters talking in an enchanted forest. She embarks on a quest to find the other unicorns, because surely she can't be the last. The unicorn takes you through her unforgettable journey where she learns about friendship, loss, love, and regret. This movie truly tugs on your heartstrings, which is why it is a classic. The storyline, musical score, and the voice acting are nothing short of stupendous. The soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking and America's memorable music coheres with the exquisitely plotted story. Plus, I cannot possibly envision anyone but Mia Farrow as the Unicorn and Jeff Bridges as prince Lir. If you haven't watched this wonderful fantasy, then please watch it! It will capture your heart, young or old, and never let go...

 When I watched it as a child, I got scared by Momma Fortuna and I couldn't understand the meaning of regret... but as I grew older, I understood. Please don't write this wonderful fantasy off as an animation geared toward children. It appeals to adults. It's not by any means Disney-esque; the story is bittersweet and multi-layered. I suggest watching it with your child because as I've previously said, there are some scenes that might scare them. With that being said, This is a must-see and a must-own by the fans or anyone who wants to become enthralled by a magnificent, beautifully-layered story. I want to see this movie with my kids and see the looks of wonder and awe on their faces.",1362441600,5,2196,4.654639175257732

569415,1,6303047564,"I really felt like this movie wasted my time without giving anything worthwhile in return. Because it's by Arthur Rankin of Rankin-Bass, I hoped for a truly classic story, like Rudolph or Year Without a Santa Claus, and all of the endearingly unforgettable elements that go with it (like Heat Miser and Snow Miser, or the Island of Misfit Toys). Instead, this is a drawn-out, poorly-architected story that poses as a fairy tale, and is like someone's stoned or drunken epic hallucination. It's not appropriate for young children, with a scary roaring ghostly bull and a couple of other random ugly monsters, but it's not a strong enough story to win the interest of an adult.

The Last Unicorn searching for the other unicorns (since they're immortal - what happened to them?) is a premise with so much possibility. But this movie just blew it with a combination of burlesque (a hippie butterfly who sounds like Cheech singing clues to the unicorn, ""Schmedrick the Magician"" who can't ever make his spells come out right, etc.) and plain crummy plot development. The unicorn accidentally gets turned into a naked blonde woman with a striking cartoon-y resemblance to Stevie Nicks, and after falling in love with the prince in the castle where she, Schmedrick and Maggie (a good-hearted outlaw picked up from an incompetent outlaw band in the forest) are hoping to find the other unicorns, she wants to forget she was a unicorn at all.

But the story keeps right on wasting time with a skeleton that can't stop laughing when it's asked for magical answers, the dreamy cynicism of the castle's gruesome ""king"", and the ramblings of a pirate-y cat.

It just goes on and on, but not in any meaningful way. The unicorn lost my interest and sympathy when she never seemed to care about the people who were trying to help her, the magician also kept on refusing to try at crucial moments, and the ending - where she is turned back into a unicorn and has freed the lost others - is not satisfying. You never see her meet the other unicorns or return to her forest to resume protecting the ordinary animals abandoned there, nor does she say thank you or goodbye to the prince. The cheesy soundtrack annoyed me beyond belief.

I know how cynical this sounds after the many 5-star glowing reviews, but I'm sticking by it. It's not a classic story, not even a good story, and not a good movie.",1360713600,5,2381,4.688995215311005

569481,4,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn is one of my favorite childhood movies.  The screenplay was adapted from the original novel by the original author and really knows how to draw the audience in and make them a part of the fantasy.

The voice acting in this movie outshines the animation.  With voices from the likes of Christopher Lee, Mia Farrow, Jeff Bridges, Angela Lansbury and many other well-known names, the characters in this story come to life and in an amazing and magical way.  This cast could not have been better selected and the songs and orchestrations provided by America really help to highlight the tone and theme of the movie.

The animation is traditional for the Rankin Bass studios.  It shines in action and detail scenes but, can be choppy and slow in other areas.  This still does not detract from the story and will probably go unnoticed by the audience as they are drawn into the film.

The commentary track and other features are really amazing.  Peter Beagle, the author of the original novel and screenplay really highlights the way in which the story was developed and demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of animation and the animating process despite it not being his particular field of expertise.

If someone enjoys this film, the blue ray release will not disappoint.  The image quality is superb and the audio is flawless.

When the Unicorn overhears huntsmen in her wood mention that she may be the last of all unicorns, she sets off on a journey to discover the truth. Along the way, she meets a bumbling magician, a strong-willed and opinionated cook, a crazed king with a castle full of crumbling secrets, and a would-be lover who is naive to a fault. Minor characters such as an amorous tree, a one-eyed, peg-legged cat and a drunken skeleton add a delightful element of humor into a story that can often veer into dark and despondent territory.

The 2004 release is a pile of crap. The 2007 DVD version was MUCH better as far as sound and picture quality. The downside was that the dialog was censored. To me it wasn't a huge deal except for one key part which I think most fans know as it's one of those memorable scenes that just stand out. So I was bummed this particular scene was censored. So 5 years later and I've got the blu ray player and the big flatscreen HD tv... and a blu ray comes out that is both good quality and uncensored! Naturally I had to pick it up.

Ok the blu ray is the exact same quality as the DVD except that it's uncensored. The picture is incredibly grainy. It feels like I'm watching an old VHS movie. Now I know this is because I'm watching it on an HD TV... the DVD from 2007 needed to be cleaned up but it didn't look this noticable but then, I wasn't watching it on an HD TV either. As an actual Blu Ray release, this is terrible. The only reason I would buy this is if I didn't already own the DVD from 2007 or if that one censored scene meant that much to you that you just HAVE to have it in there. So if you already own this movie and think a blue ray release would look spectacular, don't waste your money. If you don't own it, pick it up... you might as well as it comes with both the DVD and the Blu ray so... and it is the best release of this to date. But this was not cleaned up for HD viewing at all.  I'm thinking this is gonna be the best it's gonna get for a good while till someone who knows how great this movie actually is and decides to give this a proper clean up.

UPDATE: If anyone happens to read this review... So I've now bought my 4th copy of the Last Unicorn. This time I purchased Das Letzte Einhorn 3D copy from the German version of Amazon. It's region 0 and if you have a blu ray player capable of playing 3D blu rays, I'd pick up this copy over any of the american releases. The quality is noticeably better than any of the American versions. It has both a 3D and 2D option but since it's a 3D disc, I'm guessing it will only work on a 3D blu ray player.

569786,4,6303047564,"When I was a kid, I used to select this movie at the video store over and over every time my aunt took me to pick a rental. So of course I had to buy it as an adult. I think the appeal as a kid was simply because it was about unicorns, which I loved and collected (and still do). Now? I'm not sure. The movie is confusing, complicated, and not exactly a kid's story. I picked up the book recently, hoping it would add insight to the film, as films are always condensed, and it did. I have to say this is one instance I like the movie better. The unicorn - usually portrayed as such amazing creatures, was such a snob in the book, frankly. She was untouchable. She was perfect and had no compassion. It wasn't because she was mean. It was simply bacause she was SO perfect, nothing mattered. Or something like that. In the movie, the unicorn, while still coming across as infallible, was also kind.

I originally owned the other DVD edition of this movie and had to replace it because this was the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" and I thought it would be special. As years passed in between viewings, I am uncertain, but... was this edited? I could have sworn when Molly Grue met the unicorn, she yelled ""Damn you! Damn you!"" several times. Not ""How dare you!"" While that's a pretty mean way to greet a beautiful unicorn for the first time, I really don't like my movies edited. Besides, damn is pretty much the most mild swear word there is. Anyway, the harpie still had her boobs, and that was one ugly bird!",1330387200,2,1505,4.318021201413427

The themes are profound and universal, and are realized in a subtle and graceful manner.  I actually think the film may surpass the book in expressiveness, which is a rare thing.  There are many gems here, but, for me, it is the story's villains that are most expressive.  Haggard is a poignant and near perfect symbol of all that is bitter and blind.  In the delusion that is jadedness, he believes he can hold prisoner the one spark of beauty he is able to perceive, and he cannot understand that in doing so he is destroying it.

The movie brings back fond memories of childhood - I remember loving it when I was a kid, watching it with my siblings (and no, it isn't just for little girls even though this 25th Anniversary packaging is very 'girly').  There is a unicorn, the last unicorn, who, on a desperate search for others like her, meets a quirky magician, and the two embark upon an epic adventure to a king's castle to search for the Red Bull and the whereabouts of the unicorns. The story unfolds with the addition of several notable characters, including Mommy Fortuna (a crazy witch) and Molly (who's first encounter with the last unicorn is emotionally gripping - even for an animated film).  The movie is enjoyable of course for the young ones of all ages, but adults will like it too.  I was surprised I still like this movie as much as I did when I was a kid.

569861,3,6303047564,"In this whimsical, animated film, a lone unicorn seeks out others like herself through a mystical land of talking cats and spellbinding magicians. Based on the book by Peter S. Beagle, this story has enamored the hearts of fans - young and old - from around the globe. In her search for other unicorns, the last unicorn encounters a cast of delightful characters as well as dangers she never imagined. Throughout the fantastic adventure, she learns of friendship, love, and most importantly, her true self. Discover the magic that has kept this tale a treasured classic. Featuring the voices of Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow and Angela Lansbury, the story brings forth the power of friendship, the beauty of love and the pain of regret. Interlaced with songs and ethereal imagery, The Last Unicorn will reignite the hearts of its fans and entrance all who enter.
I decided to try this movie because my daughter currently loves unicorns.  Her overall opinion was that the movie is ""To long but great!""  She had this to say as well, ""I liked it because it was nice and had a unicorn and I love unicorns.  My favorite part was the red bull.  The worst part was when the witch died because she was old and mean.""  My husband really enjoyed the music to this movie.  We agreed with my daughter, the movie is too long and is easy to lose interest in.  I was shocked when I looked at the running time to see it is only 93 minutes.  The movie felt much longer.  Our least favorite part was in the beginning of the movie.  About the time you first meet the unicorn you are also introduced to a rambling butterfly that you would really prefer to stop talking.

On the technical side, the difference between the DVD and Blu-ray edition is so minor that to the untrained eye, or for most consumers, one would not recognize the Blu-ray disc from the DVD version.  The quality of both disc are the same due to the movie being drawn rather than shot with high definition cameras.  Quite frankly, it can only be so good.  Both DVD's feature Schmendricks Magical Gallery and a mini documentary in the special features section.  The DVD holds a game ""Escape the Red Bull"" for users to enjoy.  The Blu-ray disc holds a commentary.

The original movie was made in 1982 and is based off the well loved novel, The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle.  If you are a fan of this book or movie you'll love this upgraded version which holds the best quality the movie can boast with current technology.  If you've never seen the movie, the story is unique and worth the watch.  I would suggest renting it before you purchase this film as the story is one that will, most likely, interest current fans of The Last Unicorn rather than shake up a new fan base.

Once that tape finally gave out I looked to amazon to get it on DVD so I would always have it. I'm 19 now and I watch this movie still about a couple times a month. I don't know what it is, but it just had this power over that just makes me so freakin' happy! I love everything about it.

I've never seen the censored version but I understand that it doesn't have some ""nudity-ish"" parts nor ""cuss words"" or the duet with Prince Lir and Amalphia.

569913,4,6303047564,"It's a shame that Amazon is just mixing in all the VHS, DVD, and blu-ray reviews into one huge pile.  There are over 500 reviews now for this title, and the blu-ray has only been out a couple of days.  If I was reviewing the film, THE LAST UNICORN, then I would give it a 5/5.  But I'm not, there is the entire blu-ray release experience to consider:

PACKAGING:  In a word, poor.  This is one of the ""Security Device Enclosed"" blu-rays.  Once you get shrink wrap off, you get the adhesive sticker that closes the case on both the top and bottom.  After it's opened, you have the magnetic strip across the inside and you also have the flat RFID circuit sticker.  Try to remove them and you are in for a huge mess.  I even had the help of adhesive remover and it still damaged the case removing them.  You're better off just buying a new case if you want ugly security tags removed.  A couple of advertising inserts, one pretty cool, the other junk.  Nothing else inside except the two disc, one DVD and one Blu-Ray.  Both are stamped with beautiful color artwork.

BLU-RAY EXPERIENCE:  When you put the disc in, you are exposed to several trailer advertisements before you can get to the movie menu.  The title menu is locked out if you try to select it with the remote.  You can however click 'next' to skip past each trailer.  You must hit 'next' on the remote 5 times, each time waiting for the disc to load the new trailer.  This should have been a category in the special features section, not force-fed when the disc is inserted.

The disc will also phone-home as soon as you put it in claiming to ""Check for Updates"".

As the final credits draw to a close you once anticipated a curtain drawing over the theatre screen.  On this blu-ray, however, you are unceremoniously dumped onto an FBI WARNING page using bold red text that threatens to lock you in a cage for 5 years and bankrupt your estate if you even think about copying the movie.  It's out of place, changes the mood, and shouldn't be at the end of the credits.

The special features are nice.  There is a short ""making of"" documentary that was shot in 1080p.  Some of the people interviewed are recorded over the telephone, but this doesn't distract very much.  There is another section that resembles more of a ""CD-ROM"" type experience where you use the remote next buttons to click through the pages.  This section reveals the history of the author in quite a bit of depth.  I found this section equally interesting.  Another section features artwork from a recent contest that is a nice bonus.

THE MOVIE (no spoilers):  5/5 stars.  Everything comes together to create a melancholic and nostalgic quest through some truly spectacular artwork.  Each frame of this movie was hand drawn on film and then shot with a camera.  There are ZERO digital effects in this film.  EVERYTHING is done by hand.  And it makes a considerable difference.  In fact, I don't think you will ever see this type of film made again.  This technique is too expensive and time consuming for contemporary film-making and the temptation of digital shortcuts is certainly irresistible to those funding the project.  Couple this in with an emotional musical score by ""America"" and you have something that is truly unique and it will not, cannot, be reproduced again.

The film is often grainy, but I'm ok with this.  I prefer as pure a transfer as possible and I sense that purity was a goal in this blu-ray transfer.  It looks crisp and sharp.  There are imperfections and sudden color shifts occasionally in certain frames, but it is not distracting.  The artwork in this film is so powerful that any small blemishes or imperfections are easily overlooked.

SUMMARY:  Marketing greed and anti-theft zealously scuff up an otherwise competent blu-ray experience.  The bonus features are solid but the real reason you're buying this blu-ray is the movie itself.  And it's worth it.",1298419200,33,3921,4.636098981077147

However, I have been informed in an e-mail newsletter:

""Please note - Peter still gets money from Last Unicorn movie sales ONLY through Conlan Press. That goes for this new Blu-ray edition, too. If you buy it anywhere else Peter gets nothing at all. Which really sucks when you consider that 1.8 million Last Unicorn DVDs have been sold in America since 2004, and only around 6,000 of those went through Conlan Press. None of the other copies earned a cent for Peter. So please encourage everyone you know to support him by buying the combo pack through Conlan Press, and nowhere else. Thanks!""

I don't know if this is also true of Amazon sales, but either way Amazon should address the issue directly and clarify this.  I am not comfortable putting something like this in an Amazon review - essentially a plug for another supplier - but I think it is important information.

EDITED AND UPDATED (2012):

Peter Beagle has come to an agreement on rights that is very satisfactory to all parties.  He is now in full ownership of the rights to this movie and gets properly paid for sales.  Disregard the above!",1295654400,41,1163,4.611650485436893
569918,4,6303047564,"For those of you not in the know The Last Unicorn is a really nice fantasy movie based on the popular book by Peter Beagle. As the name implies it's about unicorn who found out she is the last of her kind and sets out to uncover the truth behind that. She soon finds out all of the other unicorns have been captured by a mythical creature, and with the help of an inept magician and a surly maiden they seek out to bring the unicorns back from captivity.

The story is among the best in fairy tale fiction. You have a fair number of mystical creatures and learn interesting tidbits about them throughout the film. You also have a romantic aspect between a prince and maiden (which is required for many who love fairy tales), sword slinging action, wondrous magic, singing (we'll get to that later), and comedy all done up by the voice talents of A-list actors like Allen Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine, Edward Scissorhands), Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby, Hannah and her Sisters), Christopher Lee (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars prequels), Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Tron movies), Angela Landsbury (Beauty and the Beast, Murder She Wrote), and a slew of other notable talents.

The action scenes are exciting and directing does well with the movement and colors in these scenes. The scenes that involve the romance feel real with characters hitting home the type of emotions a young love can feel. The fun scenes are really fun, but it's more dialog kind of funny. Lots of good one liners come from the script. Not so much in the realm of visual comedy unless you count the scene with the laughing skeleton and maybe one scene with a talking cat. The villain (done by Lee) is pitch perfect in execution as both a bad man and a flawed human being. The voice acting feels just as perfect with maybe an exception to Arkin's Schmendrick, whose lines sometimes feel a little wooden.

The animation is done by the Rankin/Bass team. They are more known for their stop motion holiday specials. However they also have a respectable cartoon portfolio with tv shows like the Thundercats and movies like The Flight of Dragons, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and The Wind and the Willows. The animation is much like their other feature films with the same distinctive look and feel. It actually fits well with this movie. The frame rate isn't on the same rotoscoped level as some Disney classics, but it's not anywhere near as distracting as some Saturday morning cartoons made back then.

Now this being a fairy tale, and much like what Disney made the standard for these types of films, there is a singing interlude in the film. Now this is a duet from actors Jeff Bridges and Mia Farrow, and well... they aren't singers. You can hear the strain from the voices. Originally the plan was to have Katie Irving sing Mia's part, but apparently that never happened in the final theatrical release. If you're a big fan of musical numbers this won't impress you. Now as to the rest of the music like the title theme and about all of the montages have songs from the band America, and they are really good, original songs. I recommend getting the soundtrack if you are a fan of this band.

Now previous video releases of this film had various levels of criticism tied to them for various reasons. The original DVD release was a poor transfer with no special features. The 25th Anniversary Edition had a much better transfer and had extra features, but was an edited version; taking out the occasional PG swear words the film had and even speeding up the film slightly (which made everybody talk in a bit higher pitch). Another bad thing about the 25th Anniversary edition was Beagle didn't get any royalties on the release. Now the Blu-Ray edition coming out should address a number of issues:

1 - Peter Beagle himself has been expressing a lot of enthusiasm for this release, but unfortunately he's still not in the loop for royalties. If you want Peter to get a fair share please get your copy at the Conlan Press website. They are also selling Blu-Rays signed by Beagle himself.

2 - Beagle announced that both the censored 25th Anniversary version and the original uncensored theatrical version will be on the Blu-Ray. Unfortunately the DVD is really just the 25th Anniversary edition so no it's going to have the same issues.

3 - When Beagle saw the Blu-Ray he was blown away with what he saw. Does that mean a true high definition treatment? Sounds like it.

Not a whole lot of definite answers to some pressing questions, but since it's all coming from the man himself I find it encouraging. The Last Unicorn will be presenting in full high definition 1080p with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for both the censored and uncensored English audio. This combo pack will have the following bonus features, some of which are exclusive to this release:

Audio commentary by Peter Beagle and publisher Connor Cochran - YES!!! Finally a commentary from Beagle.

The Tail of the Last Unicorn - Basically a short retrospective from Beagle.

Making-of The Last Unicorn - A brand new documentary on the making of the movie.

Escape the Red Bull - Pretty much a kid's game made for DVD.

Schmendrick's Magical Gallery - Production stills of the movie. This is a bid expansion from the previous DVD version with more stills than ever before.

Art Contest Gallery - Brand new extra. I think this will be entries from the 2010 Last Unicorn art contest. Beagle selected the winners himself.

Original Theatrical Trailer

So far from what I am hearing this is the release to get excited about. It fixes much of the problems the previous releases had and gives us the extras we deserved to get from the get go. If you love fairy tale fantasy you owe it to yourself to see this film. Any current fan of the film should go ahead and consider taking that double or triple dip for this edition.",1292803200,77,5859,4.634522661523626

The new Blu-ray will offer the film completely uncensored, but it will also include the edited ""family friendly"" audio track for those who prefer it.

The audio in the 25th anniversary is EDITED!  I couldn't believe it as the lines were playing along in my head as I watched, and I got to several places where a heartfelt mild expletive was to be heard, and it was missing.  ""Just what is ___ was there to stop for?""... "" ____ you, where have you been?!?""... ""cross, loss, moss.... _____!""  The funny part is, they actually missed an edit in one of Ruhk's lines, while the same word was cut in 2 other places.  There was absolutely no reason for these edits to be made, as it would have been well within the bounds of its rating anyway.

To make my frustration worse, the low quality full-screen transfer actually has the fully intact audio track.  You're in a position of naming your poison. I will stick to the German release of the film, Das Letze Einhorn, which has both a wonderful wide-screen transfer, crystal clear intact audio, and only edits the title screen to reflect the language change.

The story of how the Last Unicorn began her journey to find other like her always reminds me that we all search for acceptance.  Once changed into human and she says ""I can feel this body dying all around me"" we too live in a world where friendships die, friends and family too.  To overcome the betrayal of her human body and fall in love was remarkable, but Amalthia remained true to herself and remember who she once was.

Minor as in little, not age. Possibly the first adult cartoon ever made although tame in comparison to Japanese anime'. Some violence, occult imagery, and images which may be too disturbing for kids under 5 years old would be how to describe this. Rated G?! Did they actually watch it to rate it?! Rated PG.

I can't imagine you would be disappointed in this movie, not only because it's great for the whole family, but because it is so true to the book.  I dislike when a writers work is changed for the sake of the movie, and although I must admit I am only 3/4 done with the book, so far, so good! Give this one a try.  Great for the entire family.

I finally bought the DVD version, excited to at last see it in widescreen, but was shocked when I put it in the DVD player!  They went through and censored out all the ""curse words.""  It's not as if this was particularly filthy language, just a few stray instances of ""damn"" and ""hell.""  These words are heard everyday, even on daytime television--not exactly something you are going to be able to shield anyone from anyway.

Knowing the film nearly word for word after all these years, I was horrified that they would put out such a sanitized version.  Sickened, really.

I'm holding out in the hopes that they will re-release it with the proper, unedited version.  Until then, don't waste your money on this version.",1263945600,29,871,4.496815286624204

The characters are varied and rich and far from being stereotypical and one-dimensional.  We even sympathize a little with the villains as we understand why they do what they do.
I really enjoyed the songs, which were performed by America.
The movie is generally clean, although some of the frightening scenes may be too intense for young children.  The violence is without gore and usually happens away from view.  There is a small part with a nude woman, but her long hair covers the essentials.  I can't tell you why she's clotheless without giving away some of the plot, but that small part is tastefully done.

570016,5,6303047564,"4.5* I love Peter S. Beagle's works, especially ""The Last Unicorn"", ""Tamsin"", and ""A Fine and Private Place"". I watched this a long time ago, and remember loving the story, and today I was finally able to share it with my 5-year-old daughter. In the screen adaptation (the screenplay was also written by Peter S. Beagle), Mia Farrow plays the Last Unicorn who inadvertently learns that she is the last of her kind. Curious to discover the fate that has befallen the rest of the unicorns, the last unicorn learns from a Butterfly (Robert Klein) that an entity known as the Red Bull has herded the unicorns to the ends of the earth. Unfortunately, she finds herself captured by the witch Mommy Fortuna (Angela Lansbury)as part of the witch's Midnight Carnival. The unicorn is able to escape with the help of a novice magician Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and proceeds to the seaside castle of King Haggard (Christopher Lee) and meets the dreaded Red Bull, a fire elemental, but is once again saved by Schmendrick when she is transformed by his magic into a mortal woman, Lady Amalthea. Here is where Amalthea's/the last unicorn's quest gets really interesting and complicated, for it is at the castle of King Haggard that Amalthea meets and eventually falls in love with Haggard's adopted son, Prince Lir (Jeff Bridges).

The rest of this magical story explores what happens to Amalthea and Lir, will their mortal love survive the revelation of Amalthea's true identity, and will Amalthea fulfill her real quest to find the rest of the unicorns, and defeat the evil Red Bull? The story itself is magical, but what makes it compelling are the various themes explored, regarding friendship, self-discovery, faith, courage, love, and mortality. The anime (Japanese animation) is beautiful, and I will always consider this a classic. The songs are also melodious and meaningful. Highly recommended, though I would advise caution for the under-5s since there are some scary depictions in this movie.",1257292800,2,1988,5.006042296072508

570081,5,6303047564,"Probably one of the most cherished non-Disney animated family movies from the last century, The Last Unicorn was based on the book of the same name by Peter S. Beagle. This was one of the few theatrical movies produced by Jules Bass and Aurthur Rankin Jr., better known as Rankin/Bass, the creators of nearly every Christmas holiday TV special, and other hit shows like Thundercats and Silverhawks.

Set sometime during the middle ages, a unicorn discovers from a passing butterfly that she is the only one left in the world. She leaves her forest in search of them, but gets captured by a witch for her travelling carnival. The unicorn is set free by the novice magician Schmendrick. Along the way, they are accompanied by the ex-bandit wench Molly Grue. The trio make their way to realm of King Haggard where the other unicorns are supposed to be. Once there, Haggard's menacing Red Bull appears to drive the unicorn into the sea. In order to protect her, Schmendrick taps into his true magic and turns the unicorn into a human female, which makes the Red Bull give up on her. Our heroes then enter into Haggard's castle under the guise of looking for work, with Schmendrick claiming that the now-human unicorn is his niece, Amalthea. Schmendrick keeps Haggard entertained, while Molly searches for a way into the Red Bull's lair which is supposed to lead to the missing unicorns. Haggard's son Lir has meanwhile has fallen in love with Amalthea, believing her to be just a beautiful girl, while at the same time Amalthea is growing fond of him and growing to forget her former life as a unicorn. Molly and Schmendrick eventually find the secret entrance, and with Alamathea and Lir into tow, they confront the Red Bull. Amalthea is changed back into a human, who because of her newfound human feelings is able to defeat the Red Bull and free all the unicorns that were trapped in the sea. Amalthea the unicorn then heads back for her forest, with Schmendrick and Molly apparently hooking up together in the end.

This film features some of the best animation by the Rankin/Bass group since their animated version of The Hobbit. The studio responsible for most of the actual animation though was Topcraft, whose work also includes the anime movie Nausicaa. The character designs are very unique and original too. The movie features an odd assortment of voice actors, like Mia Farrow doing a wonderful job as the unicorn, Christopher Lee as the mad Haggard, Alan Arkin as indifferent Schmendrick, and Rene Auberjonois steals his scene as a laughing skeleton. There have been two DVD releases of this movie, the original, and the 25th Anniversary Edition which has way better quality.

What a well-written, poetic, heartbreakingly good story. The movie is animated beautifully and the actors did a superb job with the voices, especially Mia Farrow!

That said, the DVD version of this movie sucks. I had the VHS copy and lost it, and bought this DVD to replace it. Boy, was I disappointed. Everyone else has pointed out the problems--crappy quality, poor menu options, etc. But, if you've never seen the movie before, and the DVD is your only option, I would recommend overlooking the problems with quality just to see the movie.",1253750400,3,824,4.5675675675675675

570085,4,6303047564,"This is the Last Unicorn which had ""re-runed"" on several channels, including Disney a couple years back. Nothing much has changed from that, other than the quality of the videotape.

The quality of the videotape is a grade up compared to the VHS and television versions, which have been grainy. The pictures are clear and crisp, a nice added touch yet stays true to the quality of the film itself (no deleted scenes). For some reason many of the 2004 reviews have stated that the quality is bad. This is inaccurate when comparing the DVD's picture quality to the trailer feature of the disc and the original VHS. This dvd has been played on a 2009 Xbox 360.

The only audio-availability on this dvd verison is dolby 2.0 and 5.0. The subtitles are for spanish and english, but the audio output is in english only.

As for features there is not much to offer. There is an interview of the author concerning the making of the book, the ""lost chapters"" of how the book truly started and a boring game of the red bull.

Some reviews have been about censorship of the movie, or in other words ""edited"". The movie from the television version has not been edited from its origin (as far as television re-runs go) and infact yes, there is one swear word. When the hunchback henchman is talking to Fortuna in front of the harpy cage he says "" I don't care how many damn spells you got on her, get rid of that harpy!""

There are no deleted scenes or plot-breaking edits that would truly affect the entire quality of the original story-line itself. The impact of these edits aren't very important for a couple of word changes like ""hell"" or whatnot as there was little offensive words to began with. As an example of a ""stripped"" movie, try Once Upon a Time which was suppose to be the original Windaria. Now that's a censored version. As for TLU the harpy is still as ugly, naked and vicious as it was in the original.

This is a good dvd to get if you want the movie itself, however it is lacking in the ""goodie"" department as far as concerning special features.",1243382400,,2052,4.458666666666667

I saw this DVD on sale at the grocery store and snatched it up, eagerly waiting for the day that my daughter would be old enough to enjoy it.

It sat in the box for close to a year. While at an endurance ride, it began to rain and my student and I ran home to get this DVD to watch on her mom's laptop in the camper. All of us visibly cringed when we watched the bad redubbing of the same butterfly scene over and over again as he continued to ramble--horrible editing! ""Now THat I'm A Woman"" should have been left out, or at least grafted more smoothly into existing footage. Several scenes, such as when Amalthea looks at her reflection and unicorn paintings and the scene where she and King Haggard converse on the parapet are ruined by bad dubbing and editing. I've seen community college broadcasting students do better editing jobs.

However, there are a few scenes that are somewhat interesting. One where Schmendrick overhears Lir calling him ""that ridiculous magician"" and the Midgard serpent in the carnival.

570089,1,6303047564,"First of all let me say that THE LAST UNICORN IS A 5 STAR MOVIE! The 1 star rating I have selected is for this particular DVD release by Lions Gate.

 The last Unicorn is a precious childhood memory filled with action, adventure, romance, and music. Those who have never seen it should not mistake this movie as a bright and happy kiddie fairytale. The story is quite dark and full of moments that might scare children who have been sheltered by todays ""sanitized"" as another viewer called it, movies.

This story is raw and pure and a delight for anyone who enjoys animation at its best as well as those who appreciate things for what they are. This is a splendid fantasy story with a classic 1980s animation feel that is unmistakable.

The 25th Anniversary edition should have been a wonderful blessing but as soon as I noticed the first sign of sensorship editing I was very angry. Words such as ""Hell"" and ""Damn"" have been removed where as the phrase ""I wish to God"" has been left in tact. Such editing makes no sense and if this is to celebrate the anniversary then it should be left as it was with only an upgrade in picture and sound quality. Lion's Gate has done an extreme injustice to both this movie and its many fans and should be ashamed of themselves.

As far as the picture quality goes, it is very much improved over all the previous editions. Much better than the grainy picture of the old DVD that wasn't even presented in widescreen. The 5.1 stereo sound was also very nice but it didn't seem to matter when compared to the fact that they edited it.

Dispite the imporvements I agree that fans should avoid buying the 25th Anniversary edition and demand that Lions Gate go back and do it right this time! NO EDITING! And from what I can tell, although the picture was much better they could have done an even better job with the clean up, there were still imperfections in the film quality due to age which I know can be fixed, it just takes more time and money.

Isn't it true that when you do something wrong you should be the one punished??? So if the studio releases a bad edition of the film, shouldn't they be the one who gets burned??? Could it be that they are not getting the message from the millions of fans around the world???

Please boycott this 25th Anniversary edition of the DVD no matter what price it goes on sale for. For those who have bought the edition, please find some way to return it or demand a refund from Lions Gate. I am very sure that unless you hit them where it hurts they are not going to hear.

You are paying good, hard earned money to relive memories when you first watched this film when it was first released. But you are going to be rob of those memories when you watch this edition. And Lions Gate is the one doing the robbing -- your memories as well as your money.

I must say, that the reviews I read were commenting on the DVD setup of the OTHER DVD version that has been released...not the 25th anniversary DVD that they are commenting on and you are about to purchase.  That being said, the DVD IS widescreen and DOES have extra features and the image is CRYSTAL CLEAR almost taking away from that grainy feel that I love. Though cheezy music runs through the extra features, they are worth listening to and watching if you have interest in the film and the writer.
  The one thing I HATE, hate, HATE about BOTH DVD versions though (and this is coming from a Last Unicorn film connoisseur, those of you who aren't in love with the original won't even notice) is that they CUT OUT Molly Gru's tormented ""Damn You!"" to the unicorn!!!!! (This is during the ""How dare you"" scene for those of you who don't know.) This ticks me off beyond belief!! That was one of the favorite and most heartbreaking moments of the film! Peter S. Beagle even mentions the moment in his interview because it is so important to the film! It's just not the same. At least in this version they cut it out completely rather than just putting silence over the image in the other DVD so that her mouth is moving but she's not saying anything. UGH.
  Anyway, overall this particular DVD that I am reviewing on now (the 25th anniversary version) is actually quite well put together. I just wish they would interview Jeff Bridges and Mia Farrow and Alan Arkin NOW (or at all for that matter) about the film...that'd be cool.",1211932800,12,1551,4.505338078291815
570268,3,6303047564,"I just love this movie and own an older copy I bought when I was young on vhs video (along with numerous copies of the book). I was really excited to see this movie on dvd, expecially in an anniversary addition.
I of course bought it, the excitment of what it had to offer growing.
I will start with the bonus features, these are a bit of a disapointment, there was a lot they could have added, deleted scenes, artists scetches, cells, the soundtracks, an actual interview with Peter S. Begal, none of which they had. And while I read on the back what fetures they offered, there is no actual interview with Peter S. Begal just him telling you the story line (in case you didn't watch the movie) and Schmendrick gallery was simpley a few frozen scenes from the movie and 2 books covers (out of many.)

But the movie still was the most important part to me so I could forgive. And the movie I will admit they restored the color on which was refreshing. My vhs video appears quite washed of color throughout and where it does have color it was way over saturated so the color restoration was a nice change. But this I will say is my only compliment to this dvd, for restored color it is nice.

What they did not restore was the scene where they were trying to find their way down to the red bull and made the skull laugh (the actual scene of what they did that made him laugh.) was left out, thye did leave in the scene where he turns water into wine (some versions had that left out because of the religious reference) but not only that they also blanked out the words ""damn"" in two places and ""hell"" which seem very awkward. (Where Molly first sees the unicorn and says ""damn you where have you been"", when Prince Lir is trying to complete his poem, and when roak says hell asking mommy fortuna what they stopped for.)

The older vhs version I have at least has the original words in it. Apparently the company was trying to rerlease the movie for 5 year olds not fans.
Generally dvd rereleases (especially anniversary additions) have ADDITIONAl scenes, not more cut scenes.
It was a large disapointment that they would cut it up more before releasing it.

570272,5,6303047564,"I didn't really expect the Remastered ""Last Unicorn"" to be such a different experience, but as many times as I've seen this film, I still couldn't tear my eyes away! I saw so many details that I'd never noticed on my 20+ year old VHS. It's in widescreen. When Lir says ""Come on old man, I'll write you a reference"" you can see his face! The butterfly actually has facial expressions and subtle gestures that must have been plainly apparent only on the big screen. You can see the plates of tacos by the free-men's fire! And the backgrounds-- those gorgeous, richly detailed backgrounds. Not to mention the rich spectrum of colors, restored to their original brilliance. Oh, people. It's worth owning.

The music is restored to its epic, un-wavering orchestral splendor. It always bothered me, even as a kid, when the soundtrack would falter and make the sweeping score sound silly and embarrassing, anticlimactic. I wondered if someday they could possibly correct it, and now I own a version that does.

I have to complain about the speed, though. It's slightly faster than the version I'm accustomed to, the voices a little bit higher, and every panning shot looks tinkered with, not quite natural.

The editing of ""damn"" isn't nearly as jarring as expected. I'm still perturbed by the film being tinkered with (sheerly for the sake of parents), and as long-coming as this DVD has been, it's unlikely an un-edited edition will be seen any time soon.

The extras are more than passable, if sparse, especially the short video of Peter S. Beagle giving a bit of insight on the origins and evolutions of his beloved story. The menu seems to be accompanied by new music, which is a pleasant surprise.",1205712000,5,1696,4.778156996587031

The picture quality is excellent, as is the color, which is lovely. The animation artwork is beautiful. The entire movie is here, nothing is cut out. The sound was fine.  Let me qualify this; the sound of the movie was fine.  But the singing voices of the characters in the film are terrible.  The makers really should have dubbed in the voices of professional singers when this movie was made, or even when the dvd was recorded.  The songs are good, and involve and move the story along, but the singing makes you want to reach for the mute button. The actors have good speaking voices, the dialog is clear and emotive, but they simply do not have anything resembling singing talent. They needed two actors for each character; one to do the talking, and one the singing. That would have made this a much better movie. On the other side of the spectrum is the theme song, ""The Last Unicorn"" as well as background songs ""Walking Man's Road and ""In the Sea"" are all performed (I believe) by the group America, and they are all wonderful.  These songs are well worth hearing, the music, singing and lyrics all very beautiful.

The Last Unicorn is about an immortal unicorn who leaves her enchanted forest after learning the rest of the unicorns have vanished from the Earth. On her quest she meets many memorable characters: gypsywoman Mommy Fortuna, Molly Grue, Shmendrick the Magician- to name a few.  Molly, Shmendrick and the unicorn ban together, Molly and Shmendrick on their own emotional quests, and journey to King Hagard's castle where the unicorns are being held captive. Along the journey she is almost captured by The Red Bull, King Hagard's demon that holds the rest of the unicorns hostage. If she is captured, their quests ends, so Shmendrick changes her into a human girl so they can get past the bull and enter King Hagard's castle. As an immortal creature she never had to deal with mortal concerns, and as the beautiful woman Amalthea she begins to understand what it means to be human: the serach of identity, love, conflict, empathy. She learns of regret and thankfulness, of life and loss. Like the hobbits from ""Lord of the Rings,"" the unicorn concludes her journey, but is forever changed by the friends she made the experiences she had. The forest will always be her home, but she no longer like the rest of the unicorns, for they will never know what it is to be human.

This film is deeper than any animated film has a right to be. It works on several levels, and the older I become the more I see in it.  The plot is complex and almost all of the character's are three-dimensional. The characters are voiced by some great acting talent: Alan Arkin (Shmendrick), Jeff Bridges ( Prince Leer), Mia Farrow (The Unicorn)- to name a few. The musical score is very befitting. This is a great film for all ages. Children will love the story, and adults will see the bittersweet, dark chocolate themes that run below its animated surface.

p.s. If you like this, then you should try watching the film ""Nausicaa""- another animated classic.",1188000000,3,2178,4.574358974358974

Another reviewer described it as the ""best animated film ever,"" and while I'm not quite bold enough to echo that sentiment, at the moment, I can't quite seem to think of one that surpasses it.

That said, I'm deeply irritated by the edits that were made.  The producers who did it should be ashamed of themselves for altering a single word.  Who exactly did they think they were protecting?

But the good guys obviously can't. They're removed it from both Molly's speech and Lir's exclamation as he asending the steps to meet Amalthea. They very neatly edited it out. You won't notice it if you haven't memorized the script, but for those who have(like me) it ruins one of the most moving speeches in the movie. What does this movie have a G rating anyway? Busty trees, naked ladies and crazed, nipply harpies . . . slap a PG on ""The Late Unicorn"" and give my ""Damn!"", damnnit!

I'm also disappointed that they used Mia Farrow's singing for ""Now that I'm a Woman"" when the german soundtrack has a different woman sing the song. I thought they would remove Mia's singing and use the better version.

It's a shame that after all this work that went into this release, they changed the one thing that did matter to fans and didn't change the other thing that obviously needed to be changed.

The audio and video are crisp and clear, and the colors are magnificently vivid. Also, for the first time in the USA since its theatrical run, ""The Last Unicorn"" can be viewed in widescreen thanks to letterbox technology. The only real problem with this treatment of ""The Last Unicorn"" is a tiny bit of censoring (the removal of one or two instances of mild language that were in the original release). This annoys me on principle but generally goes unnoticed while one watches the film.

The story itself is as wonderful as ever, and the Rankin-Bass animation and star-studded cast have lost none of their power.

This DVD has a huge following of loyal fans who know the script by heart, and it's very hard to be jerked out of the moment by the realization that something crucial is missing.

I have not seen the previous DVD, so I cannot comment on its transfer, but from what I have heard, this DVD is light years ahead of the previous one, with a remastered widescreen video and a remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track. The occasional scratch, dirt, and other film issue pops up, but for the most part, this transfer is crisp, clear, and vibrant.

However, I am saddened to hear of language being censored. Since I've never seen the movie until today, I didn't notice it, but it's still a shame. I know it was done because parents complained, but they could have included two audio tracks - one censored, one uncensored. That way, everyone could choose. Also, people have complained about the 4% speedup because of the usage of the master used in the German PAL DVD release. Again, I've not noticed the difference because this is my first viewing.

What I KNOW I'm disappointed with is the lack of bonus materials. This is supposed to be a special 25th Anniversary Edition, so why are we given a lousy single-layer DVD disc (DVD-5, 4.7 GB) with nothing but a short fluffy 8-minute making-of featurette that leaves you craving more, a trailer, and a dumb trivia game? At least a more extensive making-of documentary would have been nice. Maybe including the soundtrack CD with it as well, since the only way to get it is through a German import CD.

For fans of the film, or people who just love fantasy, I can't recommend this DVD enough. The film is beautiful to look at and hear, and it's presented in a beautiful way.

I had videotaped the movie way back in 1985 from one of the pay moviechannels and had watched it multiple times, but was disapointed that it had been edited for time.  I wanted to buy The Last Unicorn on DVD, but it received poor reviews on Amazon, so I waited for a letterbox version.  I waited and waited and waited.  And finally my wait is over!  I felt like bursting into tears just like Molly had when she saw the unicorn . . . because, like many of the fans of the movie, I knew I was viewing the most unusually beautiful, poignant, and truthful animation ever created.  It was how I felt at the age of nine, and hasn't changed all these years later.
The color is beautiful and crisp and the audio is crystal clear.  The little background noises that I hadn't heard in earlier releases come through and both score and songs sound as if they were recently recorded.  The volume is also loud enough, as with DVDs the volume can be low.  Care has been taken to provide both excellent audio and video and that won't disappoint die hard fans.
What WILL disappoint . . . and what might be unforgivable to some . . . is the editing of ""damn"".  It appears three times . . . if my memory serves me right.  The first time it is spoken by Ruk(""I don't care how many damn spells you put on her!  Get rid of that harpy!)  Well, on my second viewing last night, lo and behold, I realized it got left in!  Maybe the bad guys can say damn.  But the good guys obviously can't.  They're removed it from both Molly's speech and Lir's exclamation as he asending the steps to meet Amalthea.  They very neatly edited it out.  You won't notice it if you haven't memorized the script, but for those who have(like me) it ruins one of the most moving speeches in the movie.  What does this movie have a G rating anyway?  Busty trees, naked ladies and crazed, nipply harpies . . . slap a PG on ""The Late Unicorn"" and give my ""Damn!"", damnnit!
I'm also disappointed that they used Mia Farrow's singing for ""Now that I'm a Woman"" when the german soundtrack has a different woman sing the song.  I thought they would remove Mia's singing and use the better version.
It's a shame that after all this work that went into this release, they changed the one thing that did matter to fans and didn't change the other thing that obviously needed to be changed.
I'm not sorry I bought it, however.  It's a major improvment on the old DVD.",1170806400,75,2464,4.287878787878788

With the new DVD release (which I have bought and have watched), the film is back alive and better than ever. Sure, some middle parts of the film are a little slow and dull, but the film has wonderfully intelligent and beautiful art and scenes (any red bull scene), and the musicial score by ""America"" is actually infectios at times.

The digital transfer is as clear and crisp as it could be, both image and sound. The voice talents are also solid throughout, with the random exception of awkward dialogue for Mia Farrow. The colors are full and rich, and the sound really booms at times.

570811,5,6303047564,"I think it's only proper to mention that Peter S. Beagle (author of the original book on which this is based) is in a continuing contract dispute with the company producing these DVDs.  According to the author, they haven't been paying him any royalties for the ongoing sales of the movie.  As of December 2006, Conlan Press (a company associated with Mister Beagle) is indicating that they're making great progress toward sorting out the dispute and getting the distribution company to pay all of the back royalties owed.  However, at this time at least, purchases of the DVD don't direct any money at all to the original author unless the purchase is made directly from Conlan Press.

It's possible that everything will be sorted out soon and the author will be compensated appropriately.  Still, for those who appreciate the work that Mr. Beagle has done, I thought it only fair that you know that he *may* end up getting nothing from the purchase price unless you get it from another source.

Additionally, Conlan Press has autographed copies available, for those who like that kind of thing.

On to talking about the movie itself...

I've loved this movie since just a couple of years after it came out, when I was a small child.  My grandfather recorded it on a VHS tape for me once and I played it so many times that the video and sound started distorting in places.  I've been hoping to purchase a DVD of it for quite a while, but was firmly warned by several sources that the DVD release qualities were very low, so I'm absolutely thrilled to see that they're finally doing a new release using better masters.

The main themes of the story are immortality, love, and loss.  In some ways the storyline is fairly adult, not in the sense of including a lot of sex, violence, or swearing (there's very little), but that they're more complex than it may be easy for small children to grasp.  However, I loved the movie as a small child, and it's definitely possible to enjoy it even without having the maturity to pick up some of the nuances, and occasional satirical references.

Reports indicate that special features include a featurette called ""The Tail of The Last Unicorn"" with an interview with the author, a game, photo and cover gallery, and the original theatrical trailer.

You may find the animation style to be somewhat odd or unusual.  That's just because they contracted much of the animation work out to a Japanese company, which led to a style that isn't quite anime, but certainly has some similarities to it.",1168128000,8,2531,4.705215419501134

570816,1,6303047564,"Don't buy this DVD! This DVD is playing in my living room right now, and I took the opportunity to get away and write this review. We popped this into the player and settled in for our Friday family movie & pizza night on the couch. I've never seen this movie, and I don't think I ever want to watch it all the way through. The picture and sound quality are both so lousy that I can't stand to watch for more than 5 minutes. I bought this as a surprise for my wife, who loved this as a kid. And as much as she loves it, she's even noticed how warbly the sound is and isn't enjoying it very much. Also, being full screen, not wide screen, much of the picture is cut out. There's some scene where two characters are talking to each other from opposite sides of the TV screen, and you can hardly see them... you mostly just see a castle wall.

Enough of the technical shortcomings of the DVD. Now for the subjective, opinionated stuff:

I'm not a fan of the fantasy genre, and I'm *really* not a fan of the animation style... it grosses/creeps me out, even as an adult. Same guy that did the Hobbit cartoon way back, I think. Give me Looney Tunes, thank you very much. And for getting a G rating, there are some things in there that I hope my kids repress. A tree thing with boobs? Some cussing? Plenty of creepy & frightening images.

Soundtrack: I saw that America did the music. OK, I like ""Ventura Highway"" and I like hearing ""Horse With No Name"" once a year or so. But the music score for this movie is driving me nuts! There's a duet between the used-to-be unicorn and the prince that's just plain painful to listen to. It's so bad, I feel awkward FOR the people singing it. I love Rush, Coheed & Cambria, B-52s, Bob Dylan... so I can tolerate really annoying vocals & bad singing. But this duet was over the top.

On the plus side, we've got a dog. So if I leave the DVD on the floor tonight, it'll be all chewed to shards by morning.",1160092800,5,1938,4.1876675603217155
570817,5,6303047564,"The enchanting story of a lone unicorn searching for the meaning of her existence, and any others of her kind, but comes to find out that the others are being kept prisoner in the waves of the ocean by a tyrant who lives in a black castle on a cliff's edge overlooking the raging ocean that is their keep, enforced by an enormous demonic red bull, forcing them back into the waves upon any attempt at escape.

An amusing singing butterfly circles around her in the beginning, singing many fanciful songs but providing clues here and there for her journey.

  Unicorn: ""Say my name then. If you know my name, tell it to me.""
  The Butterfly: [quoting Romeo & Juliet] ""Your name is a golden bell hung in my heart. I would break my body to pieces to call you once by your name...!""
  Unicorn: ""Say it, if you know.""
  The Butterfly: ""Rumpelstiltskin! Gotcha!""

During her quest, she meets ""Mama Fortuna"", a witch-hag with a tree stump for a hat, who is accompanied by an ogre-like henchman and a bumbling wanna'-be ""magician"" named ""Schmendrick"" {which I have come to call occultniks}.

  Schmendrick: ""I am Schmendrick the magician, last of the red hot swamis.""

Fortuna runs a travelling carnival sideshow which features a satyr, harpie, and a manticor, among other creatures of legend for the awe and gawkings of villagers. She feels she hits bank when she discovers and captures the unicorn for display, who warns her that the harpie will one day take her due, and can see through the spell placed upon these others who amount to nothing more than an old toothless lion and a monkey.

  Mommy Fortuna: ""The harpy's as real as you are, and just as immortal. And she was just as easy to catch, if you want to know.""
  Unicorn: ""Do not boast, old woman. You death sits in that cage, and she hears you.""
  Mommy Fortuna: ""Oh, she'll kill me one day or another. But she will remember forever that I caught her, and I held her prisoner. So there's my immortality, eh?""
  Unicorn: ""Let me go. And let her go to. I cannot bear to see her caged. We are two sides of the same magic... The harpy and me, we are not for you.""

Schmendrick decides to help the unicorn and eventually accompanies her in her escape and quest to the dark castle. A country wench 'Molly Grue' joins them, regretful that the unicorn did not visit her when she was ""new"", yet becomes her servant nonetheless.

  Molly: ""Where were you twenty years ago? Ten years ago? Where were you when I was new? When I was one of those innocent young maidens you always come to? How dare you! How dare you come to me now, when I am this!""

At The Castle, the unicorn is transformed into 'Lady Amalthea' {Mia Farrow} and meets King Haggard {Christopher Lee}, Prince Lir {Jeff Bridges}, along with a talking pirate cat and an obnoxious though entertaining skeleton with a penchant for wine. Amalthea falls in love with Prince Lir, which keeps her from changing back into the unicorn for awhile. As the mortal Lady Amalthea, the transformed unicorn feels her magic diminishing, the longer she remains a woman, and can feel her new body ""dying all around her"".

The group gather the clues and finally reach the other unicorns where both Schmendrick and Prince Lir battle The Red Bull.

  The Skull: ""To get to the Red Bull's chamber, you must go through time. A clock isn't time; it's only gears and springs. Pay it no mind.""
  The Cat: ""When the wine drinks itself, when the skull speaks, when the clock strikes the right time, only then will you find the funnel that leads to the Red Bull. There be a trick to it, of course.""

The Last Unicorn features an ""all-star"" cast, and the folkish music of 'America', which actually works quite well here.

Overall, it seems the Last Unicorn is a ""coming of age"" tale, the journey of a girl into womanhood until finally finding her purpose in life.

  Unicorn: [now a woman] ""I am afraid of this mortal body... more afraid than I was of the Red Bull.""
  Unicorn: ""Once, I can't remember, I was long ago, someone strange. I was innocent and wise, and full of pain. Now that I'm a woman, everything has changed. Once, when I was searching, somewhere out of reach, far away, in a place I could not find, or heart obey. Now that I'm a woman, everything is strange.""",1158364800,,4252,4.519003931847968

Having said that, I also have a bone to pick with the fact the two curse words in the script have been edited out in this rendition.

As I said I think the story, which follows the novel by Peter Beagle almost faithfully, is very good.  Disney films at the time this was released (early 1980's) I thought somewhat talked down to children.  That is not the case here and the story deals with love, sacrifice and even death.  I think that has much to do with the source novel which was written for aduilts, not children.  The cast and voice acting was very good, especially Mia Farrow.

The good story aside I did have a few issues with this film.  The first is the animation by Rankin/Bass which I now think is sub par and at times even sloppy.  Second the DVD transfer is very bad, and as another reviewer mentioned, it looks like they used a VHS tape as the source of the transfer.

A butterfly tells her that the red bull has taken them, all of the unicorns and herded them off and covering there footprints. But where they have gone he can not say, and so the unicorn starts her long journey to find them. Along the way she meets a wizard and a woman who travel with her to find the red bull of king haggard and the unicorns. When they are attacked by the red bull there is no way to escape but to change the unicorn into a beautiful lady. As they say in king haggard's castle the lovely unicorn captures the heart of the prince but as the 2 fall in love the unicorn becomes more and more human! Will she ever be a unicorn again, will king haggard find out what she is, can she face the red bull again and save the others!! Watch and see!

Ok, now to talk about the DVD itself, first let me say there are no special features you can only select a scene or play the movie that's it ok. But hers some good news all the cuss words have been taken out so this film is totally kid friendly!! Sure this word admittance makes for a weird moment where the mouth moves and nothing happens but that is easily overlooked!

I saw the original on VHS as a child and it became burned into my memory even into adulthood. Last year I met Peter S. Beagle, the author of the book, at a convention and learned an unfortunate truth. Peter S. Beagle does not receive any compensation for the use of his material in the DVD format as sold by most vendors! As much as I love this story, I want to encourage people not to buy the DVD unless they purchase it through Peter's representative, conlanpress.com.

Content wise, this movie has nothing particularly inappropriate, and the plot is very creative.  In all honesty, the actors pretty much can't sing-- Mia Farrow sings the first half of ""Now that I'm a Woman,"" and she really has no vocal ability there.  However, it comes across less as a problem, and more like someone actually singing-- as if a normal person just spontaneously decided to sing.  I actually like it.

There are some pretty creepy moments in this movie, and most of my friends have mentioned that if they saw it when they were little it scared them, but not enough that they didn't really like it.  There are two ""damn""s in the movie, but they're barely audible and not particularly offensive, unless you're looking for them... national television has worse.

I give the artists a lot of credit for the character design in this movie, which is wonderful.  The unicorn doesn't have the Horseicorn cheapness seen in several other feature films-- its true to the book.

  I won't spend all afternoon gushing, and in fact, I was almost a little disappointed that very little restoration work had been done in making it more clear and less tinny.

  However, the DVD release is nice (though there are no special features) and this is truly an excellent movie for the kids.

  This is the kind of movie you are going to love and remember when people can hardly recall sponge bob squarepants even existed (may that day come soon!) Definitely worth watching. Ten stars all around!",1142294400,2,711,4.4921875
570983,5,6303047564,"I always love reading the adult reviews of cartoons, especially if they never saw the cartoon as a child.  Every child's movie has plot holes.  Get over it.  I saw this movie when I was very young and watched it a lot.  I didn't like every character in the movie, including the prince.  I watched it because of the unicorn.  That is the point right?  I mean it is about unicorns.

I also love the people crying out over the two instances of 'damn' and the supposed adult situations.  Do you let your children outside?  Swear words are everyhere.  You can't walk down the street anymore without hearing a string of them.  Don't isolate your children, teach them that swear words make you look uneducated. Disney has adult situations in almost all of it's movies. In fact it is getting worse, such as the one liners that I hope go over childrens' heads.  You all really need to watch the modren cartoons.  There are adult themes, sex, and other subtle things around every corner.  I also like the people proclaiming Disney over this movie.  Disney makes people perfect, makes them all look the same and acceptable and in the end creates unbelievable happy endings.  I would take a talking butterfly over the endless musical hack numbers that are jammed into any Disney film.  Don't subject your children to such things.  They really are more intelligent then that.

The bottom line is that this movie at least has a theme that isn't sugar coated.  It is approriate for children but I would watch it with children under the age of ten just because of a couple of scenes that might scare them, such as the harpie.  Children's movies are silly and have plot holes and have reality issues but they are written for children - not for adults.  There is a lot of good material in this movie - at the least it teaches courage.  The last unicorn in the end faces her fears and wins.  The plot is original and hasn't been done to death.  I've never seen another movie like it and hope that no one tries to remake it.  It's definitely worth at least a rental from the movie store.

I have it on VHS and seeing all the comments about the DVD I would rent it from the video store or try to find it second hand.  The VHS video quality is actually quite good and is not grainy at all.",1141776000,4,2267,4.408212560386473

It is poetic, the music composed beautifully, the storyline enthralling and the animation effects more than decent.

This version (which I own) has had profanity removed and in only one instance can I say it was needed in the film and should have been left alone. Not only that but they didn't  cut out the footage so there's some really confusing silence for a few seconds.  This is a wonderful story that isn't all happy endings and singing furry-woodland creatures. There are only two songs sung by the characters and still those are more montages. Full of memorable characters and lovely artwork I recommend this for people of all ages. Just print out the picture for the original 1982 releases box art and paste it over this one.

571093,5,6303047564,"I saw ""The Last Unicorn"" as a child back in the 80's when it first debuted in theatres.

I have seen the VHS version, but NOT the DVD version. I disagree with those arguing for a widescreen version because of the black bars. A better compromise might be to have the studio release BOTH versions on one single DVD.

Regarding, the film, it's a cute movie about a unicorn, who discovers that there's no one else like her, so she goes on a journey full of surprises and discovers what happened to the rest of her species.

The only negative with the movie is the profanity and some of the scenes were disturbing, which I would definitely consider to be inappropriate for children. Hence, the rating needs to be changed to (R) and should only be viewed by adults, who are not as disturbed by the profanity and some of the inappropriate scenes.

To review, only buy this DVD if you're 18 and above and don't mind profanity nor inappropriate scenes in some of the film.

Otherwise, it's an excellent film because the artwork is mesmerizing and beautiful and the theme is definitely magical.

I would suggest that the studios re-release this on DVD; however, edit the profanity and the inappropriate scenes; thereby, making it more suitable for young children to see.",1137715200,,1260,4.653153153153153
571094,4,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn is a flick I like, along with its songs. I also liked many of the statements, like, ""There are no happy endings, because nothing ends.""  And I was absolutely AMAZED at Christopher Lee's performance! Such vibrancy! He's old in the Star Wars and LOTR flicks, and I didn't know it because I had never seen (or in this case, heard) him in earlier years. Totally stunning, you should see it for Lee's dialogue alone! (He's King Haggard.)

As for the elements some might not like:  There are three examples of minor profanity (though one does get very loud).  There is a tree that gets overfriendly, but it's more along the lines of ""potty humor"" that kids seem to love, and is too silly to take seriously.  There's also an undead alcoholic and a beatnik butterfly that makes references to ""mary jane.""

None of this bothered me: I was just happy NOT to have another movie where the problems get solved with a lot of violence and explosions and the heroes smile after wasting a bunch of people.  I'd think many children are exposed to more profanity at home and school than in this flick, too.

This is one of the videos I will play for the children I babysit. Despite some telling me this is a ""girly movie"" (is that ""even worse than a chick flick""?), I have found that plenty of boys can love this movie, too.  They don't have any problem with its more romantic and poetic elements.

Should your children see this and enjoy it, then introduce them to the book.  It starts off the same way as the movie and remains fairly true to it, but of course is much more complex (no surprise, since the screenplay was done by the author of the book-and yes, I'm aware it's the movie that stays true to the book). The book is not only better, but can really help to build reading skills, too (though it's not a book for children still struggling with ""Dick and Jane"").

571098,5,6303047564,"Sorrowful, philosophical, and wise, The Last Unicorn is an animated fairy tale for adults more than children.  Most modern day children would lose interest in this film with its serious themes and lack of bouncy songs.  There is some violence, with a harpy with red nipples killing a witch and eating her.  Disney this ain't.  And its a good thing.

The story is based on the novel of the same name by Peter S. Beagle.  It is about the last unicorn (Mia Farrow) who leaves her forest to find out if there are others of her kind.  Along the way, she meets sincere but bumbling magician Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and a saucy woman named Molly.  Molly cries when she sees the unicorn.  She asks, ""Where were you twenty years ago?""  Even though Molly is no longer young and innocent, she goes along with the unicorn on her quest.

The trio enters the realm of the decrepit King Haggard.  Haggard lives in a foreboding castle overlooking the sea.  Rumors are that there is a Red Bull on his land, and the bull or Haggard may know what happened to the rest of the unicorns.

Beautiful, haunting songs and a great screenplay BY Peter S. Beagle makes this film complete.  A true masterpiece.  My favorite line is by the castle cat: ""No cat out of its first fur can be deceived by appearances.  Unlike humans, who seem to enjoy it.

I met Peter S Beagle this past weekend, along with his new business manager, Conlan, at Dragon Con in Atlanta. Mr Beagle is a sweet, wonderful old gentlemen with a soft voice and a tender heart. He loves to tell his tales and always has something witty or wonderful to talk about. Unfortunately, we discovered that, due to his rather friendly nature, Mr Beagle has been sorely taken advantage of by contracts and companies. He is owed several hundreds of thousands of dollars for his creation.

The sales of the movie by Granada Media (out of London) has refused to give Peter Beagle any of the money they owe him by contract, nor has he received funds earned from the animated Lord of the Rings that recently has been more successful (he aided in that film as well).

There is also a character/creature (a harpy) that has exposed breasts, but this is the classical description of the mythical harpy, and it is not done in an exhibitionist way.  The nudity is well hidden (it is obvious the girl is naked, but her long hair covers all privare areas and she is not being sensual in anyway.)  The is also an animated tree that is drawn to suggest large breasts, but they are actually knots in the tree.  Parents are the best judge of whether this falls within their viewing guidelines for their own children.

This story teaches the concepts of regret and immortality, as well as the negatives of self-centeredness.  It also teaches to judge people by who they are on the inside, not their appearance on the outside.  One character learns to believe in himself and have a positive attitude.  A strong theme through the movie is loyalty.

Rankin produces this animated film in the drawing style of other rankin/Bass movies: Frosty the Snowman, the Year Without a Santa Claus, the Hobbit and Twas the Night Before Christmas.  The music is done by the band America.

The DVD is not what I would have liked.  It is not widescreen, but I could handle that if the picture was a little better.  They could have included some special features, such as interviews with the cast looking back at the making of the film.  I once read an interesting trivia fact that Christopher Lee (voice of King Haggard, better known nowadays for his performance as Saruman in the LOTR movies) brought his own copy of the book to the taping to make sure certain parts he deemed important were not taken out of the script.  Little things like that would have been great to see. do sometimes feel like they left things out from the book that would have been nice to see in order to understand the story better.

I mean, it could be the obnoxious ""humor"" spouted out by our ""comedian"" butterfly in the second scene that makes our heroine dance around like a drunken clown, and sing like she has strep throat, and speak as though the actress is being forced into the job.  But I doubt it.

It could be the three-breasted harpie, or the cliched ""pretty creature turned into pretty naked girl"", or the fact that the unicorn makes Mrs. Elton sound modest, but I can't stand this movie.

I was greatly hoping that with a DVD release there would be some extra futures and to my disappointment there are none. The scene selection is a minor plus. I like the fact that I can skip through at a whim and listen to the music from America. I believe picture quality is just as it was on the VHS but it may be a little crisper when the people are involved, but as a whole the screen still remains a little shaky while being played.

Even re-watching this film as an adult, I found many scenes downright scary!  The few  swear words have been edited out, but I always found the worse problem to be the scariness factor.  I think one of the reasons this movie has always been more of a ""cult classic"" than a true blockbuster is due to its never quite finding the right audience: some elements (the few songs, the Rankin-Bass characters) are simply too childish for grown-ups, but the story is a bit too dark for small kids.

This DVD IS more parent friendly than the original VHS, as the release company chose to delete a few instances of the word ""damn"" and ""hell.""  I can understand how parents might find this preferrable.  But it is blatant alteration of a classic.  Had I known this movie was edited in any way shape or form from its original form, even to make it ""less offensive"", there is no way I would have purchased it.

And does it really make it less offensive?  To be honest, I have never found this to be much of a children's story.  The subject matter is very dark and sad.  The ending can hardly be considered happy.  The whole theme of the story is the sadness of lost innocence.  Yes, it is animated, but in my humble opinion, it never made a good children's movie to begin with.  so does it really need to be edited for child friendliness?

It's not just the editing - the DVD is just crappy.  I swear that the video and audio quality are even worse than on the VHS.  It looks worse, it sounds heinous.

Spare yourself the money - stick with your VHS version, until a good quality DVD release.

The sound & colors are all fresh and nearly flawless. Gone are the scratches, dirt specks, faded colors and muddy sound. I find the artwork appealing in it's simplicity in a day of photo-realistic animated movies and I love the story and music.

571379,5,6303047564,"One of my earliest memories is running at top speed to the living room because HBO was playing The Last Unicorn. This was one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, so I was thrilled when I saw it released on DVD. Even though I'm in my twenties now, I still enjoy this movie. It is one of those stories that can be enjoyed on many levels: as a child I liked the ""good vs. bad"" aspect, plus the love stories woven in. As an adult I appreciate the unspoken questions asking ""what does it mean to be human?"" and philosphical thoughts on regret as a part of the human condition.

A small note of warning: I personally think this is fine for young children, since I watched it as a little girl. But if you are more protective, or super sensitive, WATCH IT FIRST before you let your child watch it (this should, I think be a ""duh"" for most parents). There is the word ""damn"" used in it, and I've read reviews that say an animated tree (who has tree ""boobs"") is too graphic. I disagree, but you should be aware that scene exists.

Over all, a wonderful film, even if Mia Farrow can't sing. Also check out the short book by the same title (the movie is based on book). It is an enchanting read and a quality way to spend reading bedtime stories.",1098403200,7,1243,4.196652719665272

I like the animation, Rankin-Bassy as it may be, because it has some beautiful images... the way the Red Bull is made of fire, the way the unicorns move in the sea, the way the gimpy cat with the eyepatch walks.  I love the writing, which is lifted straight out of the book, the best of Beagle's ethereal ramblings on love and death.  And I absolutely love the voice acting, including Mia Farrow (the unicorn/Amalthea) Alan Arkin (Schmendrick) Angela Lansbury (the hag) and Christopher Lee (the King).  Okay, I admit the duet with Mia Farrow and Jeff Bridges is pretty bad, but the rest of the America music is great.

Having said all this, understand why I wish someone would release a special edition of this on the level of the Disney double disc sets.  This is just as worthy Snow White or Lion King of a gloriously widescreen, remastered DVD with 5.1 audio.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  And the makers of this DVD are also cheating Beagle out of his legally awarded royalties, leading one of the greatest fantasy writers of all time to struggle for survival.  I can't support this disc.",1093910400,9,1132,4.62
571446,2,6303047564,"Although anime is beginning to change people's minds, far too many Westerners still think of animation as a genre only fit for children. The Last Unicorn ought to be high on the viewing list of anyone who believes animation is just for kids--yes, it's a ""cartoon,"" but it's also beautifully animated, with unique and unforgettable characters, and the storyline is as true to the original source material (book by Peter S. Beagle) as any movie adaptation I've ever seen.

 In her unchanging, always-spring forest lives a unicorn (voice of Mia Farrow), ageless, wise and innocent, and without regret--unicorns can feel sorrow, but it's not the same thing. One day, when men come into her forest to hunt, she discovers that she is the last of the unicorns. With snatches of help and hints from a dizzy butterfly, she sets out to find the others. On her way she picks up an incompetent magician named Schmendrick (voice of Alan Arkin), a withered woman named Molly Grue (voice of Tammy Grimes), and eventually finds the kingdom of King Haggard (voice of Christopher Lee) and his son Lir (voice of Jeff Bridges). But in the changing, aging world of humans, can the unicorn even keep track of who she is and how the story should end?

 The movie version isn't perfect. There are some awkward scenes, including a terrible duet by Mia Farrow and Jeff Bridges which never should have been included, and some scenes contain material such as mild profanity, bare breasts and depictions of death which might not be suitable for children. But there is an earnestness to this film, a magic in the way ideas are expressed, that's all too rare in modern filmmaking. This quality helps many viewers overlook the film's flaws.

 So if The Last Unicorn is that good of a movie, why does it only rate two stars? Because the U.S. DVD release is terrible. This is a full-frame release, ***not widescreen***. The DVD has poor cover art and offers zero special features. The actual transfer is grainy and blurry in spots, with no evidence of any kind of restoration work. The soundtrack has a distinctly tinny quality. In fact, the only reason one would purchase this DVD was if one had only a single copy of the film taped off television some 15 years ago and watched over and over until the VHS tape nearly wore out... rather like me, in fact.

When a butterfly flutters into her midst and confirms her fears, she risks her immortality by leaving her home and questing to find others of her species, and to discover the evil that is the mysterious ""Red Bull.""

Joined by Molly Grue, a female member of a group of bandits, the heroes soon find the seaside castle of King Haggard who supposedly controls the Red Bull. After transforming the last unicorn into a beautiful young human girl they call Lady Amalthea in an effort to hide her identity from the Red Bull, the trio attempts to investigate the castle. Within, they discover an old king who is obsessed with finding true happiness by way of possession, and a young prince searching for true love. They take up residence at the castle and begin to learn the secrets of King Haggard, his Red Bull, and the missing unicorns, but Lady Amalthea is quickly forgetting her identity and her mission, and the young prince falls more in love with her each day. If the location of the missing unicorns isn't discovered in time and the Red Bull isn't defeated, Amalthea will be a human forever and unicorns will be gone from the world!
The Last Unicorn is an American animated classic from the early 1980s. It features an all-star cast, haunting music, and animation from the renowned team of Rankin & Bass. The story is an original, emotional, and magical fairytale that speaks to all ages. However, this film is definitely not for everyone. It clearly finds its strongest fan-base among the Tolkien crowd. Fans of the Rankin/Bass Tolkien films will have the best idea of what to expect, though (if memory serves me) the animation is a tad better here. Rankin/Bass is famous for their marvelous Holiday offerings, however, stop-motion animation was always their strongpoint over the traditional style, so one shouldn't expect anything overwhelming as far as that goes. Still, some of the art and color is delightful, and the unicorn herself is quite lovely, especially as the beautiful Lady Amalthea. There are some moments when the story moves better than others, particularly during the first half, as the second half slows down quite a bit. Still, it's a satisfying watch for one who makes the effort to stick with it. The music and songs are dated, but rather haunting for probably that very reason, and the cast  is impressive, featuring such stars as Christopher Lee, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, and Jeff Bridges. The DVD is a bit disappointing, being bare bones and a pretty awful transfer, but at least the film IS available on DVD format. Overall, I'd have to say that everyone should watch it at least once to give it a fair try. In general, I prefer Disney to most other forms of animation, but it's always nice to throw something different into the broth and shake things up. The Last Unicorn is a solid piece of animated story-telling, especially compared to a lot of the other fluff that's out there.",1087430400,7,3475,4.78036605657238

571452,5,6303047564,"The Last Unicorn, released in 1982, was drawn from the novel by Peter S. Beagle. I believe considerable license was taken. This movie I saw as a little boy in the 80's long before DVD when there was only VHS. VHS. What's that some younger kids would say today. At the time, made this movie very life-like and a bit scary, especially the scenes of the Red Bull. This animated movie uses early techniques of Japanese anime as Japanese animators had to do with the making of the film. It's a fantasy epic with an easy to follow plot but a bit slowed down by musical sequences- the Butterfly with the Elton John glasses and even Mia Farrow gets to sing although her singing voice is not going to win a Grammy.
Mia Farrow stars as the voice of the Unicorn. She starts off on a quest to find out what happened to the other unicorns since she has been told she is the last unicorn. On her way, she encounters a witch (played by Angela Landsbury in a performance far from Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast) who showcases her in a traveling circus show. She pairs up with the amateur wizard Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) and aging village woman Molly on a discovery trip further into the magical land. The truth is finally revealed when the hellish Red Bull tries to take the Unicorn away. The unicorn is temporarily transformed into the Princess Amalthea. Prince Lear (Jeff Bridges) falls in love with her, much to the disapproval of his father the old and dismal King Haggard (played superbly by Christopher Lee of the Dracula films and the recent Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones). King Haggard has employed the services of The Red Bull who drove the unicorns into the sea, just to please the old king. I don't think this is motive enough and this is where the story lacked substance for me. What kind of a silly king would want to see unicorns in the sea ?

- Schmendrake was not fat and dumpy in the movie.  I think they could have come up with better angle to express the size of his nose.
- One of the distinctive traits of the unicorns was that their mane flowed close to their body, no flailing in the breeze
- IMHO the weakest link in the story, their butterfly did not even have his trademark goggles.
Once you open the clamshell case you're greeted with the same cover image on the insert.  GASP!  The image imprinted on the CD is a mirror image of the cover.
The quality of the recording was mediocre at best.  Its dark, the colors are washed out, and all the edge is soft and dirty.  I was expecting a lot more since the back cover did expressly say that it was a re-mastered version.

In High School I found the book at the library - it was equally spellbinding. At 22 this film is still my all time favorite. It lets me believe that magic is real and knights are left as children on doorsteps. Watch it. Fall in love with Lady Amalphia and the Last Unicorn.,1084492800,,427,4.219512195121951

I got this DVD in through netflix and it did indeed look awful. However, the DVD was quite scratched so I thought maybe... just maybe... because it was such consistent scratching over the whole DVD, it was just that and I'd get a newer copy. So, here I am after a google search for ""last unicorn"" AND ""poor quality"" AND DVD. So, apparantly it just does suck that bad lol. Oh well.

I live in England and the region 2 version is much better the colours work and flow  and it's widescreen edition. You may think this is no big deal but i assure the region 2 version is better then the region 1 however this film is wonderful and worth owning no matter what.

Unfortunately, my glee was somewhat unfounded. While the movie itself is still as wonderful as ever, the DVD itself is shoddy work. The movie is only presented in fullscreen (though there was a widescreen laser disc available), there are no extras -- even the picture quality is less than outstanding.
If you're looking to replace a worn VHS, this is certainly a good option. If, on the other hand, you are waiting for a DVD treatment worthy of this beautiful movie, you have more waiting ahead of you.",1080950400,3,707,4.446153846153846

Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.
If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse.",1080777600,8,825,4.657534246575342

The Unicorn after (hearing a man saying that she was the last, and talking to a butterfly about the Red Bull. )
Goes on a long and perils journey to find her fellow unicorns.
On her way she meets Mommy Fortuna a witch who captures her, and keeps her in her carnival.
 However, the unicorn does not stay her long. Schmendrick the witches magician saves the unicorn and he goes along with her on her journey.
Schmendrick gets 'kidnaped' more or less and he meets Caption Cully and his men. There he makes appear Robin Hood with his magic. The men are no longer amused by this and they tie him up to a tree.
The magician does a foolish spell and makes the tree come to life. The Unicorn saves him and they soon continue on their journey, this time accompanied by Cully's cook Molly.
 The three of them eventually make it to Haggared's castle and the unicorn is too afraid to face the bull.
The magician turns her into a human girl to protect her from the bull.
When Schmendrick, the Unicorn, and Molly finally meet King Haggared, and his adopted son Lir.
Schmendrick tries his best to help the Unicorn ( now called Lady Amalthea, name given to the unicorn by Schmendrick.)
The young Prince falls in love with Lady Amalthea and he does good deeds to impress the girl.
 Molly tells Lir that maybe the Lady Amalthea does not like good deeds.
Lir soon tries to find out more about the women he loves, and fallow her , and she starts to love him in return.
However, the poor Princes only learns that the women he loves is a unicorn.

571721,1,6303047564,"Ah, another Rankin-Bass film goes to the butcher shop!  The problems remain the same.  What are they doing with the soundtracks to these films?  How can they possibly screw them up in this way?  And how can they do this over and over AND OVER?  To make this mistake once as a quick way to make a quick buck during all the hype over LOTR made sense, but here's a film that no one is going to buy unless they are already a fan.  Why give it the same lousy treatment?
In fact, if they were in such a rush, why not just somehow duplicate the german DVD?  It seems like it would actually have been MORE work to do the terrible job they did.
And like The Hobbit, what really blows my mind is the lowsy artwork.  The hobbit in particular had fantastic cover artwork, etc. thanks to the magnificient talent of Topcraft (that would go on to become studio ghibli, surprise!), but instead it got a truly bad cover (don't worry, they're busy doing the same sort of facelift to all the children books you grew up loving too!).  The last Unicorn suffers the same exact fate.  Due to Amazon being a global store, you can just go to the bottom of the page, click on germany and type Last Unicorn right into the search engine.  When you see how great that cover looks, you'll never want to look at this one again.
I really don't understand what gives.  During the mid 70's through the very early 80's, some strange, and even intelligent animation was coming out--animation that was more literate and less song and dance.  Anyone remember the Mouse and his Child animated film?  I never expected to see any of this stuff come out on DVD because of the very small audience for it, but it seems if you wait long enough, all things will come back into print.  Just don't expect any love to be put into it.",1080432000,2,1784,4.315315315315315
571722,3,6303047564,"I wasn't expecting much from this dvd release of the wonderful, lyrical animated fantasy ""THE LAST UNICORN"", and that's what I got. It is sad that some studios just don't care about the discs they release. I'm sure the folks who put out this disc saw this as just some dumb ""children's cartoon"" and saw no reason to do anything special for the release. There are no special features of ANY KIND. No photos. No trailers. No commentary. NOTHING. But that could've been overlooked had the film been given a nice presentation. But they failed even there. The film is not anamorphic widescreen but a poor full screen transfer which is a major disappointment.
And yet, the film is still a magical experience not to be missed. This is a marvelous film. It is beautifully animated, written (by Peter S. Beagle based on his novel) and acted by an all-star cast of fine vocal talent (Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, Christopher Lee, Angela Lans bury, Jeff Bridges, Tammy Grimes and more). Mention, too, must be made of the beautiful songs written by Jimmy Webb and sung by the group America (""Horse With No Name"", ""Tin Man"", ""Sister Golden Hair""). They perfectly complement the mood of the story.
So, in spite of the frankly poor presentation of this dvd, I did enjoy the film because the film is so good it can survive even a botched job like this one. I only hope that someday some folks who truly care about films (like Anchor Bay Entertainment) will put out this film on dvd and give the film the presentation it deserves.

However, the first DVD release is rather disappointing.  Very little effort was apparently made: the video quality is poor, and the film it was taken from is clearly badly in need of restoration.  There are no special features, and the packaging looks babyish--the characters are drawn with little effort at looking true to the film, and the blurb on the back was clearly written by some hack who didn't bother to watch the film.

The movie is very much an emotional passage of sorts, with characters that are transformed by the end.  It is an ingenious blend of resolution and lack thereof, and really captures the fascination that exists for unicorns.  It really stirs the insides as you reflect on the movie after it is over.
However, I must say that after watching the DVD, I could swear that there was some odd placement of music and a slightly different edit in some of the conversations that take place.  The ambient music in certain places really disrupted how I remembered it, as if the production company that prepared it for HBO had cleaned it up before broadcasting it.  I can't be certain, but if that is true, I truly wish that version would have been placed on DVD.  I'm not sure if how I experienced the film so long ago became diffused over the years.

Starring in the last two Star Wars flicks and the first two Lord of the Rings trilogy, his name will be instantly recognized by anyone interested in the genre.

I knew when I started collecting DVDs that I simply had to have this movie on DVD, but alas It had not been released. Until now. I got positively giddy when heard it was going to be released on DVD. Waves of nostalgia hit me. I pictured various scenes from the movie and all those childhood senses hit me: Wonder, amazement, empathy, and even sadness. This movie was very powerful.
It is so hard to put into words the emotions I feel when watching this film. It is beyond all animated features that have come along since, and I think it has to do with the mystical nature of it: a lone Unicorn searches the world for others of her kind.

Then of course there is the Red Bull, a powerful bull surround literally in flames.

First of, this is my favorite movie of all time (mainly because of how many times I have seen it perhaps) so I had to buy the DVD when it came out unexpectedly. Like all DVDs, the image is crystal clear and the sound is very sharp. Lucky, there are absolutely no sound problems at all unlike the Hobbit DVD. The picture is so clear that one can notice more minor details like in the camp in the woods and on the castle. The unicorn and the characters now stand out strongly against the background unlike in the other foggy version they seemed to be one. As for the style of the cartoon, us Last Unicorn fans know that the style is focus more on beauty and art (the backgrounds are more like paintings than anything out of reality) and has a dream-like quality unlike Disney which today seems to solely be concerned with animation and bright colors.
Many fans might disagree with me but there are only 2 minor problems in the movie and on the DVD. The first problem is that some animation screens are dark and then are bright again on the screen. This problem is more evident in the beginning than any other part. It can't be helped since this was in the old version ... one just could not tell because of the fogginess. The second problem (which might be done on purpose) is some of America's song. They are terrific but some of them sound like they were recorded on cheap equipment because they have an eerie quality to them. This may be done on purpose but it was just something I have noticed and the sound quality of some songs was not improved on the DVD. UNFORTUNATELY, there are no extras on the DVD besides having closed captioning (subtitles are NOT available straight from the DVD) and 2.0 dolby stereo sound.
A real strong plus on the DVD is the movie is more fit to the screen than my old version. Also, the voice acting is superior to any Disney movie especially Christopher Lee who still sends chills down my spine.
***TO PARENTS - I recommend this movie to children 5 years or older. This movie does contain swears (""he**"" and ""damn"") but these are nothing compared to what children have been exposed today to. In my opinion, this is one of the few movies that girls can relate to better than boys. Also, the red bull and harpy might be scary to the younger set. I recommend watching with them first if they are around this age. I have also read the book and it is appropriate for the younger set as well.***
If you love fairy tales, sci-fi, cartoons, Disney animation, or you claim to be a pure 80s child, then I recommend this movie. It's one of the cheapest DVDs you'll find around and certainly worth the price. Also, unicorn movies are a rarity and the only other movie with unicorns in it worth mentioning is LEGEND.

571974,1,6303047564,"The original run time for this movie is 92 minutes, but this 25th anniversary version is 89 minutes, yet no scenes are cut. How can this be? Simply, the movie has been ""sped up"" by 4%, which is what happens when movies are put on video in Europe due the difference in frame rate. It looks like what the geniuses who released this DVD did was, take the 4% faster overseas version (meaning the audio pitch is higher), and simply use that without first trying to ""reconvert"" it back to our system to get the correct time/speed. But wait, this is equally lame, we shouldn't need to convert from a previously converted format, as the U.S. format ""is"" the original format.

Bottom line, this release is not any kind of remaster, it was simply stolen from a European release that wasn't even that good. The best quality DVD version ever released for this movie (to date of this review) was the German release, the quality will blow you away. The only drawbacks for viewing in the U.S. is, you would need a multi-format DVD player for playback (though your PC drive will work), and, you would have the 4% speed hike. Most people won't notice the speed increase, but in music it is more noticeable.

Get the German DVD if you can, it has both 2.0 and 5.1 audio, and pristine video quality in true widescreen. And it has the originally UNEDITED audio. Wonder if Lion's Gate will actually do it right for the Blu-Ray release.

DO NOT waste your money on the U.S. blu-ray release, Lionsgate dropped the ball again, the quality is awful: colors are faded, and there is so much grain it makes no sense....the good news is, the German blu-ray on the Concorde label looks like it was made yesterday, and that is no exaggeration...the colors will blow you away, but even better is the clarity and detail, it's jaw dropping, even the background forest scenes are razor sharp. AND THERE IS NO GRAIN. And, Blu-ray high definiton video doesn't have the 4% speed issues that standard definiton DVD's have. Also, The German Blu-ray is region free, so it will play on U.S Blu-ray players, except for the extras, which will not play at all as they are standard defintion.

Below are the links for the German Blu-ray, and the German 3D version of the Blu-ray; to help navigate through the german language, I found it helpful to match the pages with same U.S. amazon pages to see what options I needed to use to buy it:

Several years ago I showed it to my mothers godsons and they loved it as well. It helped them to appreciate good animated movies. The voices of the characters are great. Many you should recognize. Anyone that likes animated stories and anime movies will probably enjoy this movie. Fans of movies like ""Legend"", ""Labrynth"" and ""Dark Crystal"" should enjoy it. I have had the video for about twenty years so I am looking forward to getting the DVD.",1078704000,,566,4.504854368932039
571976,5,6303047564,"I had to watch the Last Unicorn for school and boy, I must say it was great! I'm not really into cartoons much, you know, except for the Disney classics, but when I watched this, it was auesome. It's and enchanting story about a unicorn on a quest to find all the other unicorns in the world, but as she soon finds out she will embark on a long, fabulous journey which will teach her many things. This is a light-hearted movie and is well worth the time to watch it. The characters, as well as the plot are great! Schmendrick the Magician is my favorite character as well as the Lady Amalthia. This great, fabulous, light-hearted movie, of which I would give five stars, is by far a classic!",1077840000,2,691,4.323076923076923
572101,5,6303047564,"I can clearly remember the many emotions I felt during this movie. The joy you felt at the return of the unicorns. The stark terror you felt at the sight of the red bull (by the way, he STILL gives me the willies), and the sense of sadness when our heroine unicorn is hunted for selfishness. This is not a film for the small kids (red bulls ran after me in my dreams for many nights after I saw this) but it is a masterpiece of animation. The score is phenomenal and sucks you deeply into the movie. I recommend this to everyone, not just fantasy fans. See what real animation and storytelling is like.",1077753600,2,602,4.243478260869566
572102,3,6303047564,"Almost no one, it seems, has pointed out what to me would be the primary reason to be excited about this film appearing on DVD -- that it boasts a rare score and songs by the great american songwriter, Jimmy Webb.  The songs are sung by America but make no mistake -- it all came from the hand of the genuis who has given us MacArthur Park, The Highwayman, By The Time I get To Phoenix, Wichita Lineman, and many many others that many of you are probably not aware of.  The score became available not long ago on a German import CD, but it will be great to have the movie so that the music can be enjoyed in its original context.  Long live the king, Jimmy Webb -- last of the great american songwriters!",1077235200,2,704,4.161764705882353

572104,5,6303047564,"Growing up in the 1st through the 8th grade I watched this movie through a school summer program every year.  I have always loved it.
This story is a wonderful fable about the search for happiness.  An evil king eternally searches for happiness in the Unicorn.  The gallant knight searches for happiness in ""The Lady Amalphia.""  The wizard ""Smendrick"" searches for happiness in magic.  Molly Grue searches for happiness in legends.  But story asks the question of when are people truly happy--but I won't ruin the story.  The ending is the best part of the whole story.
The movie was a wonderful adaptation of the book, but I say to anyone who likes this movie--read the book and get the FULL story.",1075939200,,699,4.680327868852459
572105,5,6303047564,"I remember watching this on Cable TV when my youngest son was little. Now that I have grandchildren, I so wanted to have this again.  Well, I finally got it on DVD and my grandchildren love it as much as their uncle did.  The animation is beautiful... the voices are fabulous... if you have someone who loves unicorns, this is a must see!",1075507200,,338,4.349206349206349
572106,5,6303047564,"I beleive it has been said over and over, ""this movie has changed my life."" And never before have more truer words been spoken. Only once in awhile does something change the lives of so many, or remain stuck in your mind for so many year. Rarley does a movie envoke such emotion, or remain deep in your heart and thoughts as long as this movie has. The Last Unicorn has changed a generation. With the book's release so long ago, with the origional animated picture, with the new motion film about to be released, and now with the DVD, the Last Unicorn is about to change even more souls.
From the first chords of music, to the last word spoken, the film is a rush of utter emotion, and nostalgic love that has stricken so many.
If you believe in love, and hope, this is for you...and in most cases, this is a movie for everyone.",1075334400,,828,4.280254777070064
572107,5,6303047564,I have loved this movie since my mother first brougt it home form the video rental store (in the original cover) and rented it many times over.  I about droped dead when I found out that they are making a live action movie set for relase this December production stared in Aug. 03!!!!  ... This is a wonderful movie that IS a classic!,1075248000,,334,4.285714285714286
572108,5,6303047564,"ABOUT TIME ""The Last Unicorn"" is released on DVD this is way long overdue. FanS of such movies as the Lord Of The RingS triology will also love this movie. For even though it starts like the children's movie that it is said to be. But after first 10 minutes or so it gets very much in same line as Lord Of The RingS..In matter of fact the ""bull"" in this movie resembles a lot the demon that is battled in one scene of the 1ST Lord of the Rings Movie..
So grownups don't be weary of this movie. It is for all ages. With a soundtrack by the classic band AMERICA..Long before Elton John did ""Lion King"" or Phil Collins did ""Brother Bear"" or Bryan Adams did ""Spirit"".There was America doing the music for this movie. This is just one of the best Fantasy filmS of all time..And it takes a soon to be released live action remake to get this out on dvd. Which is what i been hopeful about..This movie is very special to me coz this was one of my beloved Mandy's favorite movies (Mandy was KILLED by a drunk driver in 1997. STOP DUI).So buy this movie watch it as a family and be captivated by the Magical Mystical Wonder that is the Last Unicorn. And i am sure that you too will add to one of your favorite movies. And FanS of Lord Of The RingS watch this Tolkien-esque tale. If could choose more then 5 stars this would be a lot more not enough stars to exspress the greatness and brillance of this Fantasy Film Classic",1074729600,2,1413,4.17948717948718
572109,5,6303047564,"I recall seeing this movie on TV when I was like 8-years-old and its beauty and meaning really affected me. Not again a film has touched me the way this did. I am not giving away what is about, only thoughts and images. The journey of the last unicorn that runs thru the world to find her lost kin and finds love instead... A clumsy but noble magician named Schemndrick... A sad woman who has lost almost everything... A bitter and lonely king searching for hapiness and his adopted son, who will turn to be a hero... A haunting world with wonderful landscapes... An overwhelming score by Jimmy Webb and America... Let's just say that if you like fantasy and still carry with you that good old inner child and also have a taste for melancholy, this film will stay with you. But, if you are into happy endings, better stay away.
Even at that early age I saw this picture, I had a sense of loss and sadness when it ended. I think that actually, it changed me forever. A part of the innocence was gone, in a good way. It deals with deep and mature matters, kind of heavy and serious for an animated flick, but I think it's good for a child to learn to think and awaken sensibility.
I am not sure to recommend it for little children, 3 to 5... I think it's too much for them. From 7 and on, they can appreciate it more, and better for a 10 year-old. There's some middle cursing also, like ""hell"" and ""damn"", so very concerned parents should avoid it until their little ones are a little grown up.
The cast is great. Christopher Lee shines. Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin and Jeff Bridges are also here and deliver powerful performances.
Read the book which this movie was based on, written by Peter S. Beagle -who made the screenplay too, thank God, for it is perfect.
An unforgettable, beautiful, charming, touching, thought-provoking, heart-squeezing movie that you can fall in love with.",1074729600,2,1878,4.478134110787172
572240,4,6303047564,"This film truly is one of the greatest fantasy features of all time, and it should be represented as such.  The packaging, though, looks like it was designed for children.  This movie reaches far beyond the scope of childhood.  Has anyone looked at Amazon.uk to see the cover art for the European DVD release?  Its really great if you haven't looked.  The American release of the video did the same thing: it produced this fine film with really cheesy cover art.",1074556800,,462,4.654320987654321
572241,5,6303047564,"I first saw this movie on my 12th birthday in a dank theatre in the Bronx with friends. I remember laughing, crying and at times being a little afraid, but I left that theatre with all the wonders of the world in my heart.
This movie is great for kids, but not because it's a kids movie. It tells the truth about life and our world, with a beautiful unicorn, a marginal magician, and a sad peasant woman, each who are a part of every one of us.
I still own the movie and have read the book which the movie stuck very close to. I will love this movie until I am dust.",1074384000,3,566,3.973684210526316

When I get out of jail in July, I will buy a copy right away. I am glad it's on DVD.",1073692800,,393,4.051282051282051
572246,5,6303047564,"This DVD is a must-have for everyone like me, who loved this movie as a kid and want it for nostalgia's sake, as well as for kids today who have never seen it before but are guaranteed to love it.
The VHS of this movie, the story of ""the last"" of the unicorns on a quest to find others like herself, was a staple of my childhood; I have been looking to add this to my DVD collection forever, and I'm thrilled I finally can.
Stirring, heartwarming, and uniquely bittersweet, this movie is truly a classic that more than deserves this updated release.
(NOTE: Parents with sensitive children might want to view it first: some scenes are pretty dark and scary for little ones, but if they can handle it, it will be a story they treasure.)",1073606400,6,734,4.364963503649635
572247,4,6303047564,"I'm gonna start off by saying ""It's not for Kids""! This movie while really good is kinda scary. It was done by the same animators who did the animated version of THE HOBBIT and THE RETURN OF THE KING. I think a lot of parents during the late 70's and early 80's made the mistake of thinking that these films were designed for young children and nothing is farther from the truth. That being said its a haunting film the harpie will scare you but all in all a great film for fantasy lovers. Look at it this way animation was a way to get around the special effects problem.",1073520000,,572,4.209090909090909
572248,5,6303047564,"This has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember.  The story, the animation, everything about this is beautiful.  I wish they still made movies like this.
This is about a Unicorn who hears rumor that she is the last of her kind.  She leaves her forest on a journey to find the others, or to discover what happened to them. On the way she befriends some mortals, Schmedrick the Magician, and Molly Grue, who join her on her quest.
This follows the book pretty closely, although this is tad bit happier. The only thing I could have done without was Lady Almalthea and Prince Lirs singing---couldn't they have had someone else do the singing? It's ok in a nails-on-the-blackboard kinda way. And it doesn't detract from the movie at all.
In short, this is a wonderful story for both young and old, or anyone looking for a little magic.",1073260800,3,844,4.503267973856209
572249,5,6303047564,"Ever sinse i watched The Last Unicorn in primary school, i've been searching EVERYWHERE to find it. There was an option for my class, to either visit a gladiator and get an autograph, or stay and watch this video called the last unicorn. I stayed, and i've never regretted it. There was only about 8 of us, and as soon as it started we were fasinated by it. I can only vagualy[can't spell] remember parts, but the rest of the class came in about 20 minutes before the end, and guess what? We weren't allowed to watch the rest. The bull completely hypnotised me! I love fantasy and scary things and the bull terrified me! I can remember a tower with a clock, and a red kind of airy bull along with cages and an eagle, but that's all.",1071878400,,732,4.273381294964029
572339,5,6303047564,"this was the #1 birthday party video when I was little. I loved this movie, even though it sort of scared me at times.

572340,4,6303047564,"If you're looking for a great video for the kids to watch, this should make the list.  Although some scenes might plod along too slowly for very young viewers, it is still a charming story for young and old alike.  The voice cast is first rate, with a particular tip of the hat to Sir Christopher Lee, who should seriously consider more voice over work.
  The downside in the cast is Jeff Bridges, who seems to want to be somewhere else, other than doing his role.  On top of that, he sings.  We're talking Clint Eastwood-Paint Your Wagon-I Talk To The Trees BAD!  In the old days, if a prominent actor, or actress couldn't perform part of their role, someone else was called in, such as a stuntperson, body double, or singer.  Audrey Hepburn and Natalie Wood had voice subs.  Why, oh WHY, couldn't they do the same here?
  The animation is not too shabby for Rankin-Bass.  In fact, the art design is quite stylish at times.  The musical score is well done, yet tends to be a bit loud.  Film length is reasonable for young tykes, with a good mix of humor and minimal violence.  I would recommend this movie to all parents.",1069113600,3,1122,4.431372549019608

572343,5,6303047564,"This was one of the first movies I can remember watching, and it still haunts me. The book is one I return to year after year, and the movie does what is seldom done in adaptations and remains faithful to the text it was based on.
The animation itself is wonderful, whimsical, and the characters linger in the mind long after the more mainstream looking characters of other movies blur in the mind. Almost twenty years later, the Red Bull still scares me. Schmedrick the magician is a loveable character, a failure as a magician who still keeps trying, and strikes a familiar chord in us all. I think any woman can relate to Molly Grue, still waiting for her unicorn. Even King Haggard is a sympathetic character if only in his selfishness.
This is a definite must have to anyone who loves fantasy and unicorns. Though it might be a little too much for young children (it scared the pants off me the first time I watched it) it is something every child will appreciate. Heck, its something grownups will appreciate too, since I still love to read the book and watch the movie.",1067817600,101,1076,4.523076923076923
572344,5,6303047564,"Other animation studios started doing what it took Disney until the Lion King to try a hand at. Putting an end to the candy coating of serious issues and emotions. While animators and actors at Disney had the muddy singing child abusers of Pete's Dragon making a laughing matter of an all too serious issue, other animated studios were giving children and adults the benefit of the doubt and credit to their ability to process and handle issues. They were also giving credit to the ability of animation to be a valid platform to put across serious issues and opinions, and to be a truly beautiful art form not just enjoyeable for children. The Last Unicorn's style of animation is based on famous tapestries that contain scenes depicting unicorns.  The background thus created is beautiful, haunting, and unique. Character design is beautiful in its own right, the characters are no Sleeping Beauties or Prince Charmings but rather imperfect by usual standards of attractiveness and being such memorable and endearing.  The characters deal with what it means to be human, regret, dissapointment, and the moral responsibility to do the right thing even if it means giving up something we desire. The heroes have serious faults, the antagonists are human with understandable intentions for their conduct, and yet the moral implication is clear with justice being delivered. I am not meaning to desecrate the sacred name of Disney, for surely I own most of their movies, and completely respect what they have done in their feild. I will, however, say that they were slow to fully realize the capability of their genre and that smaller studios that created films such as The Last Unicorn and lent a little more credit to their audience deserve a little of the credit returned. This movie is certainly a must-see.",1067731200,8,1808,4.944078947368421

Words cannot describe how perfect and wonderful this movie is... the only thing that might make people not like it is the fact that it is animated.  But even the animation is so beautiful and unique - it's real 80's Rankin/Bass, and very distinct.
The plot line is something that children can get caught up in, and that everyone can empathize with - feeling alone, and searching for others like you. The cast is wonderful, my personal favorite being Shmendrick, the failed magician (Be wary of wowsing a wizards' wath... rousing a risards... be wary of making a wizard angry!...)  The humor is sophisticated, the plot is entertaining, and the scenes are animated with a poignant beauty that you just can't find in modern Disney.  I'm instructing you to BUY THIS MOVIE.

No mortal can see her for what she truely is, except a grisled old mystic who captures her for her midnight carney of oddities and a bumbling magician called Shmendrick who releases her and helps her find the other unicorns. She encounters other strange people in her travels, including a dangerous Red Bull, who according to legend, forced all of the unicorns into the sea.
This movie might not have the same drawing techniques as the animation of today (looks more like The Hobbit), but it certainly makes up for it with a full talented cast, including Jeff Bridges, and a wonderfully whimsical story line.

That's how memorable the movie was for me. Of course, when I was five I liked it because it had unicorns in it - what five year old, doesn't like unicorns? I still like it because of the unicorns, but I absolutely LOVE it because of the story and the beautiful job the animators have done with it. It's such a touching, sad, story with equally touching, sad, music, intended (in my opinion) more for adults than for children, although both will enjoy it. I still cry every time I watch it. I probably always will.

I don't remember how old I was when I first saw it, only that I've loved it for as long as I can remember.  The animation is lovely, if not as grandios as recent Disney fare, and the story is absolutely fantasic! As everyone says, it's deep and poignant, and has wonderfully realistic characters.  The voice acting is terrific, very real.  Listening to Molly Grue yell at the unicorn (""Where have you been?!  Where were you twenty years ago, ten years ago?  Where were you when I was new?  How dare you come to me now, when I am this!"") almost always makes my throat a little tight.
This movie also has one of the best sound tracks EVER.  I have the CD of the soundtrack, and have listened to it dozens of times without once getting sick of it.  It's a good thing I have the CD, or I probably would've killed my tape by now fast-forwarding to the songs!  Admittedly, Mia Farrow should not have been allowed to sing ""Now that I'm a Woman"", and the duet (while one of the most honest love songs I know), doesn't sound all that great (on the CD, they've replaced the actors, so the songs sound waaaaay better!).

I loved this movie so much I can still hear the Unicorn's voice, ""I rember you, I remember""
The main character in this movie is a Unicorn, who lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She gaurded and protected her forest. But all of that changed when she discovers she is the last unicorn of the world.
As she travels, the Unicorn teams up with a bumbling magician named Shemdrick, and a jaded woman by the name of Molly Grue. Together they follow the path they must travel to find what has happened to lost unicorns of the world.
As I have said before, no matter how many times I have seen this movie, my heart is always touched. There is an emotion in the movie that I can always feel. Now matter how many times I have seen this movie, I still laugh at the wine-loving skull, and feel the despair of the Unicorn when her love is killed.
I have never seen a movie that touched my heart so much, no matter how many times I have watched it over the years. A fantasy classic that you will love.

For me, the old evil king is the only ""beautiful"" thing I found in this story.  Everything else seems either too feminine or just plain weird.  I guess this must be a stpry for people who think good of life.  Everything's simply too dreamy in here.
King Haggard is da' bomb (and Christopher Lee does his voice).  I always like grumpy old people because they add an unhappy image to the scene.  Also, they're forgotten a lot of the time.  Next thing I want to see is a crossover with King Haggard and Gandalf the Grey.  Now that would be an OLD MAN SMASH!!

572763,5,6303047564,"Loved this film when I was a kid, loved it again as a young adult. I am now the proud owner of a brand new copy. Along with Flight of Dragons, the Last Unicorn has got to be one of the most underappreciated animated masterpieces ever (but not for much longer, I hope). While Flight of Dragons was more intellectual, the Last Unicorn was more poignant and emotional. A wonderful fairy tale with heart and soul for people of all ages.
The animation is simple yet graceful and elegant, filled with rich beautiful basic colors. It has a surreal and dreamlike quality (even more so than Flight of Dragons). The character designs for the most part were excellent, particularly Lady Amalthea whose exotic beauty is breathtaking. I especially love the way her long beautiful, willowy hair flows in the wind...
The music is quite memorable, although the singing voices for Lady Amalthea and Prince Lir were a bit warbly at times (though the songs themselves were rather nice). The background music fits and complements the scenes perfectly.
And who can ever forget the voice acting. God, such absolute pure star quality!!! You can almost imagine as if these were real live flesh and blood people (especially Molly Grue).
The story is one of the most original I have ever come across. Based on the classic novel by Peter S. Beagle (who also did the screenplay), a lonely immortal unicorn goes out in search for others of her kind, meets some very interesting humans (some good, some bad, and some in between) along the way. She is later unwittingly given a taste of mortality and love in a way she could have never imagined when she is accidently transformed into a beautiful human maiden by a bungling magician. This is a fairy tale with dramatic and emotional depth of Shakespearean proportions. Deeply moving, moody, and atmosperic. They just don't make such powerful, thoughtful stuff like this anymore.
Now that they are in the process of developing a live action version of this film with several of the original voice actors participating in it (some even reprising their roles), it's more important than ever to own this beautiful masterpiece for your collection. I give the Last Unicorn my highest recommendation.",1026604800,44,2212,4.854497354497354

I definitely recommend this movie to kids 11+ because it sends the imagination soaring and takes you back to fantasy land. Plus, for it's time, the cartoon effects are very good.

Several people befriend the Unicorn and dedicate their services to helping her find the other Unicorn. The first of which is Schmendrick, a magician in the making and more or less a prankster at heart. The next to join the band was Molly, whom had encountered the beauty of the Unicorn before.

She begins alone on her quest to rescue the rest of her kind, having to leave the safety of her wood (where she can not be killed) and is joined in time by a hapless wizzard/jest, a strong willed woman and a warrior prince.
The story is wonderfully told and the actors use their voices well to compliment what is a most beautiful dialogue. It is further enhanced by exquisitly crafted songs with strong melodies and vivid lyrics to match.  It all adds up to a wonderful, moving and memorable experience.
In my humble opinion - there's no mistaking this as a family classic.  In the words of King Haggard:
""I know you!  I almost knew you as soon as I saw you coming on the road, with your cook and your clown; since then, there is no movement of yours that has not betrayed you!  A pace, a glance, a turn of the head, the flash of your throat as you breathe, even your way of standing perfectly still, they were all my spies!""",1022544000,3,1223,4.323144104803493

The plot of the movie is based on the book by Peter S. Beagle(read it if you like fantasy!), but I have to say that I like the movie better.  Of course, the author did the screenplay, so that might explain why the movie is so good.  It's about a unicorn searching the world for others of her immortal kind.

When his magic does work right, it's by sheer accident but when he allows his power to flow through him as it will he calls forth Robin Hood and his Merry Men, not forgetting Maid Marian. Of course at the end our heroes win out, Schmendrick finds his true magic, the Unicorn finds the others captured and imprisoned within the waves of the sea and the lost sense of magic and wonder is restored to the world at large.

573203,5,6303047564,"Peter S. Beagle, one of the modern era's finest story-tellers (and certainly the *premiere* writer of fantasy in contemporary literature), has written in the preface of his ""The Fantasy Worlds of Peter S. Beagle"" (1978) that,""The Last Unicorn is the book that people know who don't know anything else I've ever written; it will probably haunt the rest of my career..."" His prediction has not gone unrealized, and with good reason.  The story of a unicorn who fears she is the last of her kind in the world and sets out to find what may have happened to the others is a world class example of a story thoughtfully, intelligently, and unforgettably told.
The same holds true for the screen adaptation of Beagle's novel, primarily for one reason and one reason only: it is based on a screenplay written by Beagle himself.  He remains overwhelmingly faithful to the original story, preserving not only the major portions, but the more subtle details as well.
The film explores the relationship between identity and illusion.  It is not (repeat NOT) a happy story full of whimsy and silly horned creatures prancing in meadows of dandelions.  It explores mythology, reality, art, magic, greed, sexuality, and other such adult themes.  It is not a film for the immature (which is certainly not restricted to those who happen to fall under a certain age group) and if you deem it a ""kiddie"" flick solely because it is animated, be prepared for a rude shock.
The animation, though an early example of the then budding art form of anime, is splendid.  The opening sequence features the famous ""Unicorn Tapestries"" and are expertly combined with the initial credits.  More splendid than any other drawn figure in the film, however, is the Unicorn herself.  She is shown in the most magically delicate depiction I have ever seen for mythology's most popular and cherished hero.
Part of the magic which the film generates lies in its absolutely fantastic voice performances, led by the peerless Mia Farrow who lends the unicorn a tragic innocence with her emotionally aware dialogue delivery.  Christopher Lee is pat perfect as the consciously mad King Haggard.  A truly brilliant performance.  Angela Lansbury, for all her performances in the past as celluloid's ideal mum/nanny, puts tangible terror and self-delusion in the character of the faded witch Mommy Fortuna.  Arkin voices Schmendrick capably, by turn stoic and clumsy, while Tammy Grimes(Molly) puts in yet another terrific performance as a woman wounded, but not defeated, by Fate.  Robert Klein is inspired in his cameo as the Butterfly, and Jeff Bridges is suited to the character of Lir.
Though he is a dependable film critic, Leonard Maltin knows not what he speaks of when it comes to the soundtrack of this film.  It is brilliant.  It is unforgettable.  The title track remains one of the most haunting songs ever composed for a feature, and the combined efforts of Jimmy Webb and AMERICA are a listener's delight.  Especially memorable are the tracks ""Man's Road"" and ""In the Sea"".  True, the soundtrack is entirely alien to the realm of show tunes and Broadway-style songs which saturate recent Disney (and wannabe-Disney) animated features, but then this film has a very different sensibility.  There is nothing flashy or theatrical about this unicorn story.
Fortunately, the film has grown in popularity in recent years (probably because of the public's growing interest in both fantasy and animation (and anything made during the eighties)) so it may yet emerge from its cult-following to a more mass appreciation.",1000512000,15,3576,5.030508474576271

Made in a joint between the US and Japan (Studio Ghibli), its animation is anything but par. Ghibli has always done great work, with Miyazaki-san, and The Last Unicorn is no exception. There is so much beauty to be held, almost making it too heavy to carry. The eye is stunned by each character and background; all of it drawn with heart. And with outstanding animation, comes a story unlike any other. A tale of love and determination, with heart-warming and funny characters. And villains that will leave you wondering how someone could be so cold. The story of the last unicorn is not to be forgotten; never. Even the music holds so much emotion, it could not be forgotten. The songs and BGMs are of the highest quality for an animated feature, and the opening 'The Last Unicorn,' sung by Kenny Loggins, is among my all-time favorite songs. Overall, The Last Unicorn is above-average fantasy, with quality animation, an epic story, and outstanding music (and hey, the performances aren't too bad either ^^) that everyone is sure to like.",981849600,3,1309,4.695652173913044
573372,5,6303047564,"I have seen many a good animated movie in my time, but veryvery few excellent ones.  The Last Unicorn is one of them.  I don'tremember when I first saw this movie, but I could probably be safesaying sometime when I was around 3 years of age.  Of course at thatage I only watched it for the beautiful (mythical?) unicorn and thefairy tale magic that only a small child can truly understand, buteven then it stood out to me as something very special, not anythinglike a Disney or Don Bluth film.  It was less processed, more raw andpersonal, which endeared it all the more to me.  I rented itfaithfully every time my parents would go to the video store.
Now Iam much older than three, and this movie is still my favorite animatedfilm of all time.  Why?  Just as much for all the reasons I watched itwhen I was younger, but it has also evolved much in my sight sincethen. The story gives you a completely different perspective onmythical creatures and how they think and feel.  It also gives youinsight into human nature and a little bit of the real world.  And, mypersonal favorite part of the movie (and the book for that matter)--the deep quotes that really make you think.
But don't let me giveaway the movie! Among the more technical aspects of the movie Ienjoyed, I am immensely happy with how close the movie was to thebook, but what do you expect?  Peter S. Beagle wrote the screenplay!... I think that the music of The Last Unicorn is enjoyable andmemorable (and I'm not saying that just because I can quote the wholemovie ~.^).
In short--if you or your children are really intounicorns, fantasy, or just a really good story this movie is for you. And if you've automatically classified it as only a children's moviebecause it's animated, prepare to be surprized.

573374,5,6303047564,"My seeing this movie took a convoluted route. I saw the trailers as a young teenager, never got to see the movie, then found the book lying on a shelf at my summer camp, gathering dust. The camp counselors let me keep it, and I loved every page. A few years later, my local video store got a copy and I finally saw the movie.
Normally, after reading the book the movie is a vast disappointment. Not so with this. The movie captures all of the essentials and most of the small details of the novel, and keeps the same energy level and emotions. The fact that Mr. Beagle wrote the screenplay as well as the novel probably has something to do with this. ;-)
The characters are very well interpreted and acted, with the best performances given by Angela Lansbury (Mommy Fortuna) and Christopher Lee (King Haggard). Picking Robert Klein as the Butterfly was an inspired choice -- even though it's only a five-minute portion of the film, the producers paid as much attention to this minor character as to the major ones that fill the story.
As other reviewers have noted, you get the impression that none of the characters are truly ""evil"". They simply have suffered bad fortune or disappointment (as everyone in life does at one time or another), and how they chose to react to that is what ultimately shaped their character. This is a nice touch and a welcome departure from standard ""black-and-white"" fantasy characters.
The music soundtrack, frankly, is bland, and many of the songs are unnecessary (the romantic duet between the Unicorn and Prince Lir is particularly saccharine -- yes, I'm a guy, but I'm a married guy with a daughter and thinking of that song STILL turns my stomach). On the plus side, most of the songs were performed by America, and they seemed to understand the music was secondary to the overall story and kept things reasonably muted and subdued.
The animation isn't the best. I felt like I was watching ""The Hobbit"" again, just with a different story. But the animation is just a conveyance for the story, and the story is what is most important here.
This is a must-have for any fantasy-lovers video collection. While there is some violence and some slightly scary scenes, it's still a Rankin/Bass animation, and that means that kids won't be unduly frightened.",980553600,9,2286,4.703241895261845

I watched this as a child many times, the first when I was about four or even a year younger perhaps, and although total understanding wasn't quite in place yet, I enjoyed watching the unicorn and the terrifying (at the time) sequences with the red bull.  It made a lasting impression that made me seek out the movie a few years ago now that I'm older and I still enjoyed the flick, perhaps even more than I did back then.

573583,4,6303047564,"...because Edgar Allen Poe wrote on both (badum-ching!).  But seriously folks...
Suppose you had a revelation.  You wake up one morning to the tautological agenda of what has become your everyday routine.  As you whiff  the caffeinated brew of your first cup of coffee, it occurs to you that  life is not as it should be.  In the course of doing what's expected of us,  you find that little time is left for the imagination; our transcendental  self is muted and our creativity suffers.  As such, we become averse to  trying new things or augmenting our individuality and instead adhere to  what is familiar.  How do we resolve this predicament?  It is done by  relearning what was forgotten...that sense of adventure we had when we were  children.  The mature person cannot nurture without an active imagination  or appreciation for fantasy; likewise the constant dreamer is lost without  a sense of reality.  Only in happy unison, a perfect balance if you will,  do we fully benefit from each: intellectualism and mysticism.  Peter S.  Beagle's ""The Last Unicorn"" is the perfect allegory for such a  principle...well, okay, that and also it's just a great story.
The plot is  simple enough.  A lone unicorn (voiced by Mia Farrow) is in search of  others of its kind, and along the way she discovers that a crusty old king  had his demonic creature - the Red Bull - drive them into the sea for his  own selfish purposes.  A wizard transforms her into a woman, and in  becoming mortal she accrues mortal feelings, including love and regret.  These feelings become her ally in defeating the Red Bull and releasing her  fellow unicorns.  Why else was she not driven into the sea like the others?  It's because she was armored with both human and mystic qualities.  As  such, we ourselves become stronger when we harbor a blend of rationalism  and sensationalism, and know when to use each...to do so, we can conquer our  own ""Red Bulls.""  Captain Cully and his entourage were the  opposite of the unicorn; they did not possess the open minds needed to  accept and utilize mysticism: ""Robin Hood is a myth!  It is we who are  the reality!""  And were they not an unhappy lot!  Beagle warns against  falling victim to this unhealthy mindset...it's his linchpin.
The film  itself holds true to the book, largely because Beagle contributed to the  screenplay.  Christopher Lee, who plays King Haggard, has some of the best  lines and he delivers them perfectly.  Other cast members also turn in  strong performances (with the exception of Jeff Bridges, although he was  not given the opportunity to develop his character sufficiently), and the  Japanese animation style (anime) is a refreshing switch from Disney.  The  music, which often is criticized as mawkish and jejune, I found to be quite  pleasant and complementary to the film.  The one exception was Farrow's  butchering of the song ""Now That I'm A Woman,"" which almost  brings the movie to a screeching halt.
Art enthusiasts will be pleased to  note that one of the famous Unicorn Tapestries  (kept at the Metropolitan  Museum of Art in New York) is the backdrop to the movie's opening credit  sequence.",963014400,7,3157,4.826741996233522

573674,4,6303047564,"This is, overall, an excellent though, necessarily, quite simplified film of Peter Beagle's wonderful book.
The animation is classic Japanese/anime style, which bothers some people but seems quite appropriate to me.
The  simplifications to the storyline mostly involve the town of Hagsgate and  the outlaw band of Captain Cully, the Robin Hood wannabe  ""outlaw"", but also unfortunately involve the omission of the  wonderful songs that Beagle wrote and included as part of the text, which  are replaced by (of all things) songs by Jimmie Webb, sung by America. (I  would have awarded five stars, not four, if the soundtrack had included  some or all of Beagle's original songs.)
According to a story that has  been confirmed by the author, Christopher Lee (who supplied the voice for  King Haggard) showed up for the recording sessions armed with his own copy  of the book, with several places marked to indicate things that must not,  in his opinion, be omitted.
All of the voices are execllently chosen --  Mia Farrow does the Unicorn/Lady Amalthea very well, indeed, Alan Arkin is  wonderful as the slightly befuddled sem-competent wizard, Schmendrick,  Christopher gives the perfect sad and weary reading to King Haggard, and  Robert Klein is absolutely marvellous as the Butterfly.
This is a story  of inevitability and of the ending of things and of immortality and  mortality; of heroism and villainy and of love and joy and sorrow and  regret and of finding and of loss.
The Unicorn must discover what it is  to be human and through that rediscover what it is to be a unicorn, so that  she can face the terrifying Red Bull.  King Haggard's son Prince Lir (Jeff  Bridges) must become a hero in order to understand that all things have  their destinies and their destined endings.
And Schmendrick must learn  that even a wizard needs more than merely magic to be a whole person, no  matter how fiercely he desires magic...
The whole story is about  destinies and quests and fulfillments -- ""Heroes know that things must  happen when it is time for them to happen. A quest may not simply be  abandoned; unicorns may go unrescued for a long time, but not forever; a  happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story,"" says Prince  Lir.
Wonderful and sad, uplifting and (just a little, just enough) scary,  romantic and funny, this is a film for people of any age who have not  forgotten the magic of the words ""Once upon a time...""",959472000,15,2438,4.814009661835748

573676,5,6303047564,"A film that never garnered the attention that it should, ""The Last Unicorn"" features a most illustrous cast in a finely-crafted tale of the search to find oneself. Mia Farrow is outstanding as the voice of the unicorn who experiences what it is like to be human. Jeff Bridges, as her human suitor, is his usual reliable self. He also doesn't do a bad vocal in his duet with Farrow's unicorn. Adam Arkin is good as a slightly ""off-centered"" butterfly!

The ""bad"" guys in the form of King Haggard and Mommy Fortuna are performed by the always fantastic Christopher Lee and Angela Lansbury, respectively. Their years on the screen and stage are used most effectively in their interpretation of the characters.

The animation, though not up to Disney standards, does have its moments. The escape of the harpy eagle from her cage is truly a frightening scene. The emergence of the Red Bull and its assault on the unicorn is a nail-biter. And the release of the trapped unicorns at the film's end is stunning.

The songs, many performed by rock group America and penned by Jimmy Webb, will not last in the memory, but are still enjoyable within the context of the film.

This is a good family film, but I would not recommend it for the under-7 set. The intensity of some scenes as well as the subject matter may be a little too ""mature"" for them to grasp.

573753,5,6303047564,"I absolutely loved this movie as a child and must have watched it over a thousand times. I could hardly believe that I would ever find it again. This movie is so true to the book, which is very rare nowadays. It sparked  my interest in fantasy and has to me been a classic for all times. It's  touching love story, element of fantasy, and endearing characters have  stuck with me throughout my life. I would recommend it for anyone of any  age!",947030400,3,444,4.313253012048193
573754,5,6303047564,One of the best things about this movie is how faithful an adaptation it is from the book. And no wonder. It was scripted by Peter S. Beagle the man who wrote the fantasty classic. So many phrases and happenings mirorr  exactly the book that it's a good idea to have a copy while you're watching  the movie. The animation isn't great here but the voices suit the  characters well and it ends up being a great movie. Buy it!,944524800,5,423,4.2625
573755,5,6303047564,"I remember this movie from a LONG time ago. I'm not a big fan of non western animation, but this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters are great, the music is great....and  it's a little more serious or grown up than most animated films of it's age.

Sadly....the DVD that's been put out is a horrible animal. There was no remastering what so ever. My VHS plays at about the same quality as the DVD. Wait for a Special Edition.",942969600,4,455,4.27906976744186
573874,5,6303047564,"I love this video! It has great music, a great storyline, and great characters. It really made me believe that there are such things as unicorns. It's a very touching film for children and adults alike. If  you're into mystical legends like unicorns, this is the video to buy. It  has everything!",942019200,2,296,4.673076923076923
573875,5,6303047564,"I remeber watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid and I cried every time.  I hadn't seen it for over ten years and now I once again own a copy.  Even though I'm in college now I still watch it a lot.  It's  not only a awesome movie, but something that should remind everyone of when  they were watching it when they were young.",941846400,,344,3.927536231884058
573876,4,6303047564,I have alway liked this movie ever since was little and i think and child or adult would love the songs and characters. I think anyone who likes cartoons or fantasy should watch this movie.,940032000,,189,4.428571428571429
573877,5,6303047564,This is my all-time favorite movie.  It is very deep and appealing to everyone.,939254400,2,79,4.642857142857143
573948,5,6303047564,"I remember seeing this movie as a little girl and enjoying it oh so much.  I had thought that the tape had gotten eaten by our VCR and was very disspointed, but later learned that it had The Hobbit recorded over it.  I  immediately thought to buy it again but could find this wonderful movie NO  WHERE.  Amazon.com is helping me buy it again!  This movie really deserves  the five star average its getting, unlike many others.  I have loved this  movie for so long and was very sad when I thought that it was maybe not  sold anymore.  I believe that this movie is not just for kids.  But I do  agree with one of the critics.  Where is the other cover?  The one with the  black bull on it? But, I do reccomend this movie to everyone that has a  taste for fantasy at its best.",928627200,3,774,4.121621621621622
573949,3,6303047564,"I love this version, but I seem to remember a version with real people and dwarves, and a girl transformed into red/black clothing, and a hideous chase thru a castle.  Ring any bells?  I want to own both!",926899200,,204,4.342105263157895
574050,4,6303047564,"I first bought this movie for my daughters, but have pulled it from their library due the profanity in a few spots.  Frankly, I don't want my 3-year-old daughter repeating the phrases, ""Damn you"" and  ""Where in the hell..?""  Since when does a children's movie  include such language??  If there was a version released without those  words, I would buy it for sure.  As it is, they won't be watching this  again until they're old enough to understand what's inappropriate to  repeat.",924307200,,482,4.780487804878049
574151,5,6303047564,"I've loved this movie from the time it was released, when I was five years old, until now...The Last Unicorn is one of my all-time favorites.  Don't let the title fool you;  this movie proves the old adage ""you can't  judge a book [or movie!] by it's cover.""  The Last Unicorn has  wonderfully complex characters and is beautifully animated. Cartoons aren't  always just for kids!  This is very artistically done, and I've never met  anyone who saw the movie and didn't love it. (That includes my skeptical  roommate who thought it looked ""My Little Ponyish.""  She watched  it after I bought it--and now she loves it, too.)  The soundtrack has  beautiful music as well, and it just adds immeasurable value to the charm  of the movie. By all means, get a copy of this video and see for yourself.  The story is incredibly special, and will stay with you for years.  Don't  miss out on this one!  It's the best accomplishment made in the animation  genre that I have ever seen.",921542400,10,974,4.590643274853801
574152,5,6303047564,"If you have not seen this movie yet, and are a fantasy fanatic, then you had better see it soon. It is the perfect blend of mystery, fantasy, intrigue, and romance. Like a really good cup of coffee, if you ask me. Up  until I saw it was re-released when I last visited this site, I thought i  would never see it again. Now I can't wait to buy it!! As I said before if  you haven't seen it, see it!!!",919382400,3,399,3.9012345679012346
7837094,5,6303047564,"This is one of the best movies ever made. Ya sure the animation isn't that great, but the story and the music are amazing. If you get a chance to read the book I recommend that as well.",1526342400,,185,3.8947368421052633

Did you know Peter wrote the very first story about a female unicorn?  Until his book all others always referenced male unicorns.  Anyhoo, it's a fantastic story about love and personal growth.",1525910400,,339,4.365079365079365
