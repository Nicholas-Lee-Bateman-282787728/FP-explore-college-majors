The Rough Riders always watch the trail,
The Rough Riders Never Fail.

This was #6 of what they call an 8 series set of Rough Rider's films. Most of us that enjoy riding the trails with these Rough Riders will have all 8 of them.  And as far as the series goes, this one isn't a bad film at all. It may be dark in places and difficult to see some things but overall this is a good solid western from those days of old.  In fact it was released a year b4 I was born!

Out trio is brought together again due to Sandy's birthday at the Hopkins Hotel in Texas, a party as the movie says at ending almost turned into a necktie party for him.  As we all know though the 3 U.S. Marshals will soon have the town under control.  We even end up with justice for the 'boss' crook (Harry Woods) and a female (Lois Austin) going to prison to boot. And who could overlook all 6 foot 5 inches of Sheriff Trump an actual westerner off screen (Glenn Strange)?

All's under control with Buck heading back to his Arizona ranch, and Tim heading north to Wyoming, with Sandy to follow Buck to Arizona for a wedding party for the two lovers (Mary Hopkins & Dave Dodge).  As usual with these films several familiar B movie actors will be included in the cast, easily recognizable, these stock actor give outstanding performances.  Sadly, in November of 1942 Buck Rogers would die a hero in the oft described fire. Of all the 166 films Buck was in he only had 3 left to make before he hung up his spurs for good.

Another great film from the era of the so called B movie.
