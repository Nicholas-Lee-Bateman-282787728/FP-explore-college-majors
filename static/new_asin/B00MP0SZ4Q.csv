6597485,5,B00MP0SZ4Q,"I am writing mainly to offer a different response to H Bolet's middling review below. Video is visual. It has to influence the reviewer of a product like this one. In my opinion the visuals are wonderful. It is filmed beautifully and the editing is also musically sound. It doesn't hurt that Corina Belcea herself is lovely to watch and brilliant musically at the same time nor that the whole quartet is clearly engaged at every level. Most importantly for me, it has to be said over and over that these overwhelming masterworks can take all sort of approaches, from the slightly dry eyed, though clear cut and incredibly faithful, versions like the Alban Berg to something more romantic and heart on sleeve like these versions. What is important to me is the quality of the playing and the dedication and musicality. These are wonderful, wonderful performances. For a video Beethoven Quartets, I would highly recommend these.",1421452800,4,926,4.904458598726115
6597486,3,B00MP0SZ4Q,"Well, loving the Beethoven Quartets like I do, I just had to get this bluray of the complete set. It's quite a disappointment though. You know when a part in a movie or play is marred by overacting? Sadly, this is what happens here with the whole cast. If they would just play what Beethoven wrote - with the accuracy they're obviously capable of, the great art that is Beethoven's string quartet writing will shine through. Straight from Bluray 1 We're off to a bad start - These overpraised (why?) performers play the Op 18 set like they're playing Brahms or Tchaikovsky: way too much romanticism. Vibrato abounds; swelling; point making and lily gilding; exaggerations. Seasickness inducing rubato. A lot of it sounds like Beethoven is stuck in the mud. I wish a more authentic, historically correct group had beat them to this project. Also, the sound is a bit too distant. That may be why the cellist just doesn't cut through like he should - his input is a tad wishy-washy - or maybe he just lets the violinists dominate. Listen to his ""da,da,da DA da"" entry in the 2nd section of the first movement of Op 18/2 - an exquisite piece of cello writing that most cellists savor is played in quite a feeble way. This happens again later in op 59 when 1st violin & cello have Q & A comments within the music - weak cello with 1st violin sounding like a cat sat too close to a rocking-chair. A quartet should be balanced - not weighed heavily to towards first violin. It's good to have all this stuff in one box - but if you prefer classical, Mozart and Haydn inspired Beethoven (wit & brilliance) to melodramatic, heart-on-the sleeve sentimentality, which sounds like it was written for early 20th Century string quartet groups, proceed with caution to the ""Buy It Now"" button.

Edit: I've raised my rating from 2 to 3 stars. These performers are much more at home with The Late Quartets and give acceptable performances of those - also, they seem so nice in the documentary - I find that I can't be cruel to them and must show them some mercy - even though I'm sure they're quite happy with their successful careers and I hope they continue to do well, if it attracts more people to this great music.",1418688000,13,2201,4.530150753768845
6597487,5,B00MP0SZ4Q,"Heads up !

According to Amazon customer service this morning, the ""Region B/2"" classification for the Bluray release of this Beethoven String Quartets (Belcea Quartet) is apparently correct ... if so, I assume it will not play on N. American Bluray players.  ""Region A/1"" is for N. America (as well as other parts of the world too).

I wrote ""apparently"" because the product details on the EuroArts website indicate that picture format is NTSC, which in my understanding is for N. America (as opposed to the PAL format).

Anyway, I e-mailed EuroArts to get their take on the matter, and will update this review with their response ... my call to Amazon lasted nearly 10 minutes, so it isn't as if the service rep didn't look into the matter reasonably thoroughly.

It appears to be a wonderful release, as usual, from the folks at EuroArts ... looking forward to buying it ASAP :-)

12/4/14 UPDATE : EuroAtrs e-mailed me today, assuring me that the product details should read ""Region Code 'All' "" ... furthermore, they are working on having the Amazon listing corrected :-)

12/13/14 UPDATE : well, that was quick :-)
Thanks to Classical Music Store, this wonderful collection of Beethoven chamber music is playing in my home theater 5 days after ordering ... far be it from me to comment on the particular performance - it's been 35 years since I owned most of these quartets (vinyl LPs :-) ... Let's leave that up to persons more familiar with these works.

That being said, there's a reason they are considered masterpieces / cornerstones of the classical repertoire.

I do feel qualified, however, to comment on the audio/visual quality of the release ... so here goes ...

The Bluray image is first rate, and the video direction is fine ... more importantly, for myself, the audio is first rate.  The DTS Master Audio format is crystal clear, a delight for my ears, mind, and soul.

The most appealing aspect of Bluray discs, IMO, is the HD audio formats ... as an owner of over 100 classical and opera titles, this EuroArts release is state of the art.

I'm looking forward to exploring and becoming familiar with these quartets over the next several weeks, and for years and years to come.

And yes, it's coded for ""All Regions"", as the product details now state.

Writing this update with the Opus 18 #2 quartet playing in the background, it sounds as if there is a quartet playing here in my home ... viewing it on my TV and hearing it through my ($7,000) sound system, it's almost as if I'm there at the performance ... highly recommended.",1417392000,7,2551,4.688340807174888
6597488,5,B00MP0SZ4Q,"Evidently at least one of the other reviewers here got a free set.
I had to wait to buy mine. Fortunately MovieMars had a good price offer.
Let me tell you what you'll get since the specs are too specific. The set comes in a cardboard clamshell box like the ones that used to come with LP opera sets. Inside, you'll find a small booklet listing all the quartets movements and some text concerning the quartet and the recording. It's a convenient size for referral when you're listening. The four (single layer) Blu-ray discs are in cardboard sleeves that are stacked in the center of the box.
My Pioneer elite player had an issue with the first disc I tried to play. When I went to switch from stereo to 5.1 once the disk had begun playing the whole player locked up and the only way I could turn it off was to unplug it not even the front panel switch worked. When I restarted the player I switched from stereo to 5.1 before I started the disc playing and didn't have an issue. The other discs played perfectly.
The performance is done on an open stage and the sound is presented in a gentle surround format that seems about ideal to me. Individual instruments when emphasized are clearly heard what the quartet is a whole forms a cohesive sound. I had a brief concerned that they would do something tricky like assign one instrument to each main speaker, not the case here.
I have enjoyed the Beethoven quartets over the decades and I've accumulated a number of sets, which are good for reference purposes - it comes down to one or two that I regularly return to. I'm not going to start giving a musicology lesson here - if you're here looking at this set I'm sure you know exactly what to expect from the music.
I will said that the Belcea's reading falls in approximately the middle range, meaning not ""lush, romantic, mellow"" as in perhaps a Guarneri Quartet interpretation, nor ""ascetic, angular, analytical"" as some have judged the Alban Berg Quartet. After hearing most of the string quartet recordings over the decades the ones that I find myself going back to are the Italian, the Vegh and the Cleveland. The Belcea Quartet joins them now, and the more I hear them, the more convincing I find their case. Having gone back to listen to their Op. 95, I am convinced of its rightness.
They give a clean, modern reading that doesn't linger but still has magnetism. I appreciated that their interest is in communicating the music with a true balance of intellect and emotion.
The sonic stage is stable which reinforces the feeling of being in the audience even though you can see a lot more than an audience member could.
Corina Belcea is a strong leader as first violin, but she has a worthy partner in Krysztof Chorzelski on viola, who makes
dynamically seems the core of the group. [Please see further discussion of this in the Comments section}.

The camera holds some long shots where appropriate, but we also get to see the violist's very expressive face. It seems very appropriate that the faces of the quartet are shown more often than just the bowing. The efforts and the emotions that each one is experiencing are there to see and I find that to be very illustrative and a big improvement over just listening to a CD.
And speaking of that, this set of Blu-ray discs is not much more expensive than a set of CDs.
There is also a 47 minute documentary on the final disc. This is not a set to watch marathon style, it is best savored over time, which I'm looking forward to.

I have noticed that the SONY conglomerate has been putting out bargain reissues of their back catalogs of string quartet recordings, many 6 disc sets for under $20. Admirable, but tread carefully. Some of their transfers by Andreas K. Meyer have been treated like pop recordings: compressed dynamically, boosted to the point of distortion, top and bottom frequencies shaved away - all so they are suitable for joggers with mp3 and earbuds. There's no hiss or rumble, nor is there air, resonance or the dynamics showing phrasing and interplay, and the distortion wears on the ear. If you have earlier CD versions you may want to hold on to them.",1415318400,25,4132,4.567385444743936
6597489,4,B00MP0SZ4Q,"The Belcea Quartet has the marketing advantage of putting out the first set of the complete Beethoven String Quartets on video. That deserves a tip of the hat.

That having been said, as a video performance I'm not overly impressed. Cameras linger on interpersonal exchanges which I don't care about rather than fingerings, bowings, etc., as well as the 1st violin whose name brands the group.

Musically? Others here are saying it's only middling in comparison to other performances they have on CD.

So if you really want this for a living room experience, go for it. But I would wait, some other quartet will do better very soon.",1415145600,5,632,4.779816513761468
6597490,5,B00MP0SZ4Q,"This set of the Beethoven Quartets was made during just 12 days in 2012 in a series of `live' concerts held at the Wiener Konzerthaus. The audience listen in rapt silence and without movement throughout to the point where it could be tempting to wonder if the audience was only there for the applause at each end of each quartet. By very careful observation of the front row heads outlines this can be seen to be not the case when minimal movement can be detected.

This is only worth mentioning in so far as it acutely illustrates the spell that the performers consistently cast over the audience throughout the series.  Generally the camera work is sufficiently close to exclude the audience but without being in any way invasive. What it illustrates throughout is the high level of commitment of the players and their close communication by eye and by body language. This reflects the total identification the players have both with the music and each other. These are interpretations revealing an extraordinary empathy with each other clearly honed over an extended period of time working together.

What comes over immediately with the early Op 18 set of six quartets is the distance Beethoven rapidly travelled from the musical worlds of Haydn and Mozart for example. Humour is emphasised in this group of quartets through making great point of the dramatic, textural and dynamic range of the music.

This sense of humour is appropriately supplanted during the Op 59 set by heightened emphasis upon the dramatic content of the music, number two being intensely powerful in that respect. Beethoven's use of silence becomes a force of suspended tension and the listener becomes increasingly aware of just how Beethoven is playing with the unexpected and that effect on his audience. A light touch returns in the third of these quartets and this is maintained in a finale that is delivered at virtuoso speed and is especially thrilling to watch and hear.

The qualities of these performances described above and below continue through the rest of the quartets. The presto third movement of opus 74 provides a further clear example of contrasting lightness and drama being delivered at tremendous speed with a wide dynamic range ranging from a whisper to forte - a considerable achievement. The opus 95 rightly leads us directly into the late quartets with its marked dissonances and strong contrasts all well caught here by the Belcea Quartet who thus successfully prepare the listener for the more introverted world of the final quartets. This is an uncompromisingly tough reading delivered with virtuosity.

The Belcea Quartet prove to be deeply satisfying guides to the final set of quartets, all written after the 9th Symphony and Fidelio opera. In those Beethoven explores worlds far removed from previous quartet writing and these readings are correctly far more introspective interpretations as befits the music.

The lighter and alternative ending for the Bb quartet opus 130 was presented in earlier performances during the preparations for this series. The far more substantial Great Fugue was played later in those preparatory concerts instead. On these discs both complete versions are provided rather than having alternative endings available to be added to the same first movements. This is obviously more musically satisfactory even though the timings are practically identical with only the two first movements having a clear difference of 29 seconds. The Great Fugue, with its considerable technical challenges successfully overcome in this performance, inevitably enlarges the dramatic effect of the music and changes the character of the quartet. Listeners will have their own preferences and will be able to make that choice in the proper context of complete performances.

This review is not intended to give detailed analyses of individual quartets but is intended to be a guide to the overall concepts and achievements. They can be further summarised as follows:

The quiet playing throughout this set of discs is especially marked and compelling with one or more of the players achieving sounds barely above a whisper to be followed by considerable contrasts as written. These dramatic developments are particularly effective in these performances because they are achieved without recourse to excessive volume and physical attack. Dynamic drama is thus achieved without sacrificing instrumental tonal qualities and at no time is accuracy of intonation in doubt.

All musical and dramatic effects are thus achieved by means of relative rather than total impact. The other effect of such playing is to emphasise the intimate nature of the works. Not surprisingly, the tempi chosen are forwardly paced and taut without being excessive or driven. The technical accuracy is faultless even at the moments of greatest challenge. Throughout there communicates a real sense of joy, either Beethoven's or the players or both as appropriate and that element makes this set rather special.

This series of the Beethoven quartets is also special for the members of the Belcea Quartet in so far as it celebrates their 20th anniversary. Those who have followed their career from early days when they made some excellent Schubert quartet recordings will not be surprised to hear that they rise superbly and satisfyingly to the challenge of producing a truly memorable and distinctive set of readings which also illustrate just how far they have developed as an ensemble since those early days.

The recording offers excellent and believable sound in DTS 5.0 and stereo. The camera work and imaging quality is of an equally high standard and fully involving without being invasive. The recordings are therefore beyond reasonable reproach and reflect the remarkable fidelity possible in the best of modern technology.

There is a 47 minute documentary entitled `Looking for Beethoven' which takes the form of a documentary collage spread over the 12 days in proper sequence. The collage consists of an introduction to the four members of the quartet and their musical activities of rehearsing, performing and very limited 'patching' during that period. In addition there are snapshots of Vienna, opinions of various members of the public to related topics such as the composer, the music, the quartet, the environment etc. as well as the film maker. Even the tensions of living, travelling and performing stress are honestly explored and described by quartet members. Despite its fragmentary construct, the film manages to fully engage and interest the viewer. This is largely achieved because of the unfailingly pleasant and supportive atmosphere thus created during an intensive period of time and activity.

Collectors who enjoy collecting multiple readings will find much to enjoy here to supplement other fine sets. Those embarking on a set of recordings of these works for the first time may well doubt the need to look elsewhere in future. In short, this set has much to offer all collectors.

At night, i had a nightmare that two big cylindrical discs were growing inside my ears making me deaf.  I woke up in terror, but then remembered in even greater astonishment that Beethoven was deaf writing most of these works.  I couldn't even imagine it, and to produce this kind of ""communication"", one only has to deduce that he truly loved.  People have been at odds about the meaning of these masterpieces, but I am positive that with this cycle bring this to light, not just because of the 1666 Strad and the outstanding playing, but because large numbers of listeners will bring the truth out.  Even though we can blame Beethoven for the dilemma of twentieth century music, he provides the answers right here.  He knew the well tempered k by heart, which is really an first attempt to sublimate the library of the bible, but In my humble opinion, I think Beethoven finished the job with his quartets.

Unfortunately, EuroArts messed up this one big time.  The reason - copy protection.
The only way they can be played is from the disc, since copy protection (bad sector writing, etc.) prevents the convenience of having it on the harddrive either as a playable disc image or converted to x264/flac files.  Every time you want to watch/listen, you have to fumble around with and wait for discs to spool up.  And it only played on one of the five different players resident on my notebook, with issues with the menus not working properly.  Is the brain trust at EuroArts not aware of the increasing irrelevance of discs that has been brought on entirely by this kind of ignorant and self defeating obsession with copy protection?
Want to exercise your legal right to play it on your tablet?  Not going to happen.  Want to encode an audio only version for your smartphone or portable player?  Good luck with that.  Want to make a back up of these expensive discs?  Don't waste your time.

No DRM Copy Protection = Further Sales  ...  DRM Copy Protection = Sales declines until bankruptcy is reached.  These facts have been repeated over and over again for over a decade, and yet the idiot executives never learn the obvious.

My first and last purchase of a bluray classical music release.  I feel ripped off.
