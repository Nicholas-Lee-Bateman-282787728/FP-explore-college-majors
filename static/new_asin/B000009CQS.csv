We will probably work on it for a couple of months then move on to karate for kids 2 .",1255910400,,253,3.7735849056603774
7905340,5,B000009CQS,"I bought this to help my kids learn the basic Karate stretches and moves.  It shows that at a slow pace, gives the kids a chance to practice them, and then does then at a normal pace.  Its a good place for them to start.",1218067200,,220,3.8666666666666667

7905342,3,B000009CQS,"The camera focuses from the waist up, some of the time, so you can not see stances or whole body movements during some basic punch and block techniques. My 8 year old liked the music, instructor and the kids his age. He uses the streching exercises he learned from the tape. A good way to get a youngster motivated but not too good for learning techniques.",1075680000,,356,4.409090909090909
7905343,4,B000009CQS,Good tape for beginners. Good explanations and easy to follow. I recommend this one to anyone wanting to learn or if you wish to practice at home after your karate class.,1024876800,4,170,4.516129032258065
