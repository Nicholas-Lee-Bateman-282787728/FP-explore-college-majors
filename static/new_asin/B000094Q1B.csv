7989310,5,B000094Q1B,"Wonderful 70's era dramatic play about a young idealist son who has aspirations higher than his blue-collar middle class upbringing but can't seem to figure a way out.  No happy ending , but is a beautiful conveyance of real-life, with all the heart-felt emotion and drama.",1224201600,,273,4.934782608695652
