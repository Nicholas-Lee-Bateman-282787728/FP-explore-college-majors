8173928,2,B000N1QDR0,"Don't let the 996 on the cover fool you; this video was produced in 1994.  Good historical footage of 356 and air-cooled 911s through the 993.  Brief mention of 930s and 959, although the latter only in terms of its rally success.  Overall, a superficial examination of the 356 and 911 (about equal run time allotted to each).",1230768000,,326,4.586206896551724
