7851052,5,6303561306,"This tape contains 2 very interesting episodes of Lassie.  In the first the Martins set up carnival booths for Sunday School.  Timmy sets up a fortune telling booth with a ouija board.  No one is interested at first, so he makes lassie the world's first dog swami.  Meanwhile a pickpocket prowls the crowd. In the second episode Lassie draws the winning ticket for a lottery - and the winner is the Martins!  The prize is a piano that Timmy doesn't want to take lessons on, and the rest of the town suspects some kind of trick.  When lassie again demonstrates the ability to pick a specific card from a pile, the Martins get worried.",1187395200,,633,4.508771929824562
