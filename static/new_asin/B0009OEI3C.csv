8064257,5,B0009OEI3C,I grew up in Calif. and had the pleasure of meeting Roy and Dale at the Cow palace. These classic videos take me back to the years I remembered watching them on T.V. Good clean Family show enjoyed by everyone.,1372032000,,209,4.25
8064258,5,B0009OEI3C,"I gave this as a gift to my parents and they loved it. No complaints. They enjoy reminiscing and really loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans so they get a real kick out of getting to see these shows again in their entirety, just the way they were back so many years ago. There are several shows included so they don't have to watch it all at once but can watch several espisodes, or just one. It made a great gift for them.",1241740800,4,418,4.048192771084337

8064260,5,B0009OEI3C,"You get a lot for your money with this company, Critic's Choice. These are not the best reproductions I've seen, but they are far from the worst. So when you consider the good quality and the low price, they get my vote. I hope they stay in business. Nothing special to report....Dale runs her cafe and Pat Brady plays the court jester, and Roy rip snorts his way through the bad guys. Of course, the acting was no better than a high school production, but who cared....It was such fun.
