8271249,5,B0018UZCVS,"I was initially concerned about being able to play it in my ""standard-not-expensive-bought-at-Best-Buy-with-no-real-research"" blu-ray player. I ordered it anyway. It works just fine. The disc menu defaults to Spanish but it has an English version that worked in my NTSC blue-ray player.",1476144000,,286,5.833333333333333
8271250,4,B0018UZCVS,"So the packagin g is in spanish, as is the menu. With a little common sense however, the audio can be switched to English ( which is how this was filmed, British actors) and even though it is a region 2 import, it plays just fine on my Samsung blu ray player that i bought at best buy in Denver.",1451952000,,295,3.933333333333333

8271252,5,B0018UZCVS,"This is a great docudrama and well worth the price. As far as the concerns of whether or not it will play in an American Blu Ray Player I can tell you that it will work for most American Blu Ray players. I say that because I tested the Blu Ray in 3 Blu Ray players in my house. 2 out of the 3 played it perfectly. As for the Blu Ray player where it didn't play, it at least played the opening part of the Blu Ray where you see a bunch of Spanish paragraphs, then it cut out when it says Track Media on the screen. My theory is that that particular Blu Ray is slightly busted a little but if it worked for 2 others that I own then I think you should be all right.",1421625600,,662,3.7697841726618706
8271253,1,B0018UZCVS,"Amazon assured me that this DVD could play in the U.S., so I ordered it, despite the cost and despite having to hook up an old Blu-ray disc player in my classroom to accommodate it.  However, I just received it and find that it was produced in Spain and is clearly marked for Region 2, that is, for Europe.  This is a very good docudrama, which I have been waiting to show to my 10th grade Latin students.  Since I can't risk not getting my money back, I have to return it to the vendor unopened.  I am very disappointed in Amazon, since I did an on-line chat with a rep who confirmed that it can play here.  If anyone has purchased this DVD and can tell me for sure that it will play here in the U.S., then please let me know and I will take a chance and open the packaging.",1385856000,3,775,4.03921568627451
8271254,4,B0018UZCVS,"This is a British TV movie about the second Punic war (218-201 BC), focusing on the Carthaginian general Hannibal.  Inevitably, in compressing a 17-year war into a 90-minute docudrama, there is some oversimplification.  On the whole, though, the film is quite accurate.  In the third century BC, Rome and Carthage were the two leading powers in the Western Mediterranean.  The first Punic war (264-241 BC) had resulted in a major Roman victory.  Both sides expected another conflict.  Hannibal conceived the bold plan of an overland assault, and inflicted three massive defeats on Roman armies, but then could not capture Rome itself.  Eventually, with his army pinned down in southern Italy, Hannibal could not prevent the Romans from counterattacking, first in Spain, later in North Africa.  To its credit, the film notes that after the initial defeats, the Roman leader Fabius conceived the cautious, systematic strategy that won the war.  However, it tends to denigrate the ability of the Roman general Scipio who defeated several Carthaginian armies, and went on to defeat Hannibal at Zama, with a numerically smaller force.  Despite this, the film tells an interesting story about one of the longest wars in ancient history.",1362873600,6,1230,5.229591836734694
8271255,5,B0018UZCVS,"I don't know why this title was never released in a UK or American edition. I'm afraid I can't tell you whether this edition is in English or Spanish or whether it is good quality or not.

This film is a BBC Docudrama produced in 2006 and starring Alexander Siddig (Dr. Bashir from Star Trek: DS9) as Hannibal, and no one else I know except for Ben Cross (Sarek, also from Star Trek). I have never understood the use of docudramas. If you want to make a documentary, make a documentary; if you want to make a period piece, make a period piece. Combining the two does not work. It is not as accurate as a documentary or as exciting as a drama. But the BBC was quite fond of churning them out in the middle of the decade. Within a few years they threw out at least than three of them set at least partially in ancient times:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Rome-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-an-Empire/dp/B0022SFCO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire</a>, Heroes & Villains (Released in the US as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warriors/dp/B001O2UTT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warriors</a>. Was the original name too confusing?), and this one. Of them all I think that this one is the most coherent. Instead of a bunch of shorter episodes dealing with different people, it spends the whole time looking at the Carthaginian general Hannibal. No, not that Hannibal. This one doesn't eat people (that we know of). Hannibal was the man who almost took down Rome itself. He crossed the Alps and brought the fight to them culminating in one of the most decisive battles the world has ever seen. Yet the Romans survived and lived to fight another day.

So, how well does it do? Historically it gets a few things wrong and compresses some events to make them fit into an hour and a half program but is very accurate on the whole. Entertainment-wise it is also very good. Some of the dialogue is clunky and phony but it doesn't distract from the story too much. The effects seem about normal for a docudrama at first. In most scenes you can tell that there are only a few dozen men playing soldiers. The battle of Ticinus features about two dozen men on each side wailing at each other with swords. That's about what I expected from the production, and it's dull. Then it reaches Cannae and everything changes. Cannae is Hannibal's big battle, the one that would define his career. He fought a Roman army that outnumbered him and managed to not only defeat it, but obliterate it killing about 50,000 men in the course of a few hours. And this film captures it just right. I really don't know how they did it. It must be CGI because they could never have afforded that many extras, but it doesn't look like any CGI work I've ever seen. It details exactly what tactics were used to win the battle and illustrates them perfectly. I don't think I've seen a better (or more accurate) battle on-screen before, with the possible exception of Oliver Stone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexander/dp/B000MGB6NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexander</a>. The battle of Zama is similarly well done with some believable elephant charges. Both of them are too short unfortunately, but that's a television budget for you. They could not have done better with what they had. A superb job.

Apart from the battles, the story's quite good since it follows the facts pretty well and the facts are pretty cool. The first part (45 minutes) covers Hannibal crossing the Alps and kinda rushes through the battles of Trebia and Trasimene (Trasimene in particular is just a voiceover with stills of dead Romans). The second half contains both of the main battles and is infinitely the better for it. Hannibal's character is portrayed somewhat inconsistently. While he starts off as a living embodiment of vengeance after Cannae he starts talking about how too much blood has been spilled and becomes a bit of a whiner. While this isn't an utterly invalid view I don't think that they handled it too well. The turnabout is too sudden and it is unconvincing to hear him talk about not taking Rome because they're not barbarians. It's not really an ancient attitude and it seems to be thrown in there to make him more sympathetic.

The casting is a bit of a problem. Siddig is great as Hannibal who comes across as both fierce and brilliant, but most of the supporting cast can't keep up. I guess there aren't many British Arabic actors to choose from which is why Hannibal's brothers look nothing alike. Then again, the Roman cast isn't much better. Cross does fine as Fabius, but the guy playing Scipio is far too old for the part. He's at least in his mid-30s and it seems strange to hear people talking about how young he is to have achieved what he did. It makes sense age-wise by Zama, but that only gives him ten minutes or so at the proper age. Hannibal should be younger too of course, but his age wasn't so significant as Scipio's since Rome had to bend all their laws to give Scipio the command. And it's also strange that a man who's most defining characteristic in his sculptures is his baldness is played by a man with far too much hair for a Roman. Most odd. But I'm nitpicking now. On the whole the film is good, the story is good, the lead performances are good, and the battles are great. The narration is only occasionally present and while it's annoying it shouldn't get in the way of enjoying the film. So check it out if you get the chance, and hopefully they'll release it in Region 1 someday.",1302998400,8,5648,4.880208333333333
