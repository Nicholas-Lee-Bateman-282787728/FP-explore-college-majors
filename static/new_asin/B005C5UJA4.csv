But geez - it takes a lot of guts to advertise a 10.00 DVD that is supposed to explain details of a haunted house and you get next to nothing.  Really disappointed.  The episode about Summerwind on ""The Haunting""  series is so much better!",1523836800,,364,4.523076923076923
8464809,5,B005C5UJA4,Perfect DVD for a specific interest of mine. Came to me in great condition.,1425859200,,75,4.428571428571429
8464810,5,B005C5UJA4,I live about 15 minutes from summerwind and have visited it also. It's pretty freaky. This video captures the mood.,1411430400,,115,4.8
8464811,3,B005C5UJA4,"There are no ""secrets"" to be found on ""The Secrets Of Summerwind. Definitely not worth the money. Nothing much presented here that can't be found rather easily on the internet. Save your money.",1403395200,,193,4.878787878787879
8464812,3,B005C5UJA4,"As far as a documentary goes....

you couldn't find a better DVD on Summerwind for historical details.

As far as capturing the true eeriness of the Summerwind grounds....

I found the DVD a little disappointing in that I could not feel the chill of the place captured thru the lens of their camera.

But then again....maybe nobody could.

Summerwind may just be a place that one would have to explore personally in order to experience the uneasiness that the narrators spooky voice tried to convey.

The ruins themselves are WONDERFUL as clearly seen in this DVD, and have so much potential for those of us who love exploring treasures like Summerwind....

It would have been nice if the camera crew at least scoped the area for lighting at different times of day.... cause lighting is everything.

The time of year is also so important in a documentary of this nature....Fall would have been better than Summer.. seeing barren trees and their dead leaves blowing around in October wind at a certain time of day....would have added so much to the ruins and their documentary.

To be fair...maybe circumstances just wouldn't allow for that...

Even so...this is why I could only give this DVD a 3.",1334793600,2,1197,4.795121951219512
