8296109,5,B001E1DJ0W,"I thank you very much for this precious gift. I remember the first time I saw the Moieseev company, it happened in the Sixties, in Milan, Italy. From then I followed Moiessev in Yugoslavia, in Italy again (Venice, Trieste). Recently I tall to my grandson about Moiseev and after that I found your DVD. Wanderful. I only regret that the programm do not produce the fantastic ballet ""The partisans"" perfectly filmed, like others, on the same stage.
At any rate, thank you very much again,
