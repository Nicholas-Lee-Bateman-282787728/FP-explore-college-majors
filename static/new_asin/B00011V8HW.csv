1965018,4,B00011V8HW,I was truly impressed with Scott Baio (?sp).  The movie was incredible and I am so glad I took a chance and watched it.  It is truly just a feel good story with an ending that won't leave you wanting.,1079049600,2,200,3.975
1965019,5,B00011V8HW,"Admittedly, I am a little biased writing this review.  My brother and his wife are both in this movie.  They do community theater in Pittsburgh and were lucky enough to land small parts in this wonderful film.  Anyway, even if I am biased, you still must see this movie!!  It is wonderful.  I NEVER cry at movies, but I did with this one.  The story is beautiful and the scenes around Pittsburgh are great.  On top of that, my brother was in it!  What more could I ask for?",1077840000,4,473,4.235955056179775
1965020,5,B00011V8HW,"First off, I never though about writing a review but this film was so good I want everyone to put this on thier MUST HAVES.  You will laugh.  You will cry. You will watch it over and over.  The story line of love goes much more then romance but, of family.  In an age of mega bucks movies thrown together for effects, its great to find a jewel where you can feel real passon for the characters.  Truly a winner!  PS  and anyone from pgh will love the shots of town.",1077667200,4,465,4.043956043956044
1965021,5,B00011V8HW,"Based upon the reviews I read on Amazon, I decided to take a chance and buy the DVD.  I have now watched it three times and have been moved even more with each viewing. It is a tender and beautiful story, one that makes you cry and lifts your spirits all in the same moment.  All of the characters touched my heart.  My only complaint about the DVD is that there are no subtitles and I have been unable to discern some of the dialogue.  That aside, this is a movie worth watching (over and over again).  What an absolute gem!",1076544000,3,525,4.158415841584159
1965022,5,B00011V8HW,"The story was original and romantic.  Scott Baio was wonderful.
Truly a charming film, I had to buy the DVD after seeing it in
the theater. Scott Baio has two other films that have not been
released as yet, Face 2 Face and Very Mean Men, I saw the trailers, they looked very good too.  I wish they were available
on DVD.",1076544000,2,320,4.145161290322581
1965023,5,B00011V8HW,"This is by far the very best movie I have ever seen.  In terms of leaving a lasting impression on me.  I have seen it several times and have taken family members and friends to see it also.  The scenes are very authentic of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania strip district.  A unique district in itself and the story is excellent.  Being of Italian descent I really appreciated the authenticity of the film.  I am still reccommending it to friends.  The acting is also superb.  I am really glad to see it will soon be available in DVD.",1074038400,4,530,4.447916666666667
1965024,5,B00011V8HW,"I saw this movie at a Film Festival and I loved it. It shows all the actors at their best. It's funny, sad, and romantically sweet. I saw this movie over a year ago and every few weeks I have been checking the website to see when it came out on DVD because I loved it so much!! I think if you haven't seen this movie your missing out and if you have seen if you know you have to buy it because it was so good. I completely love this movie and I am so excited it's coming out on DVD.",1071878400,5,482,3.735294117647059
1965025,5,B00011V8HW,"This was an undoubtedly one of the best independent films made this year. It captivates the audience and does a wonderful job of allowing us to become part of the lives of the people on screen. This is one of the best movies, on many different levels, I have seen in a very long time.",1071792000,5,284,4.181818181818182

1965028,4,B00011V8HW,"Reminded me of Nona's kitchen, parts felt right. Worth watching. If you fancy yourself a critic, take a hike.",1515110400,,109,4.7894736842105265
1965029,5,B00011V8HW,"I'm going to give this 5 stars; not because it is a critically-acclaimed or even critically noteworthy movie, but it is well-acted, great script, unusual story line and the characters simply ooze the everyday situations of real lives.  The complex, but unconditional love, in our offbeat families, and the notion that sometimes family are those we choose as well as those we are related to through our DNA.  Scott Baio was surprisingly great and the movie left me feeling haunted by the notion of how we as humans, can cycle so frequently through love and loss, without allowing the grief to sideline us forever. When a film can touch us like that, it is worth 5 stars.",1514592000,,669,4.7094017094017095

1965033,1,B00011V8HW,Even as time filler - it fails.  Painfully slow with poor script writing to fill the holes in the plot.  I would recommend to avoid with prejudice.  It even lacks a higher meaning between the lines.  deficient in every way.,1513900800,,223,4.5

The Man was easy on the eyes, perfect, drives the right car, has the right jobs and even have the right brothers.  But is love and friendship with the landlords is beatiful.  Cried for minutes but great movie.  Was sad enough that I walked away feeling emotionally drained.  But it was nice.",1510876800,,430,4.448717948717949

1965046,3,B00011V8HW,"This is a sweet little movie perfect for a lazy afternoon.  I loved the way this movie had Scott Baio's character deal with loving his elderly neighbor Bella, almost like a mother.  Dominic (Baio) is a gentle man out of step with his corporate job.

1965052,4,B00011V8HW,This is one I've watched multiple times. It is just so beautiful! I cry every time but it just makes me feel good inside. It would get five stars without the language. There is one bedroom scene but you can't see anything. Not for kids but it is such a rich celebration of life and love that I over look a couple of things that would normally bother me more.,1501545600,3,358,4.128571428571429

1965057,5,B00011V8HW,"This was a beautiful slice-of-life film. Not so much a rom-com as a story of accidental love through the pursuit of granting happiness. Truly a bittersweet tale from the heart of a family.

1965060,5,B00011V8HW,"Surprisingly a great film! Started out thinking meh... and where is this going... checking to see how much longer till it ends etc. I'm glad I continued watching! After five minutes or so I was fully engaged. Laughing and crying and not wanting it to end. Yes, it'd got some flaws in the storyline, like other viewers said. The accents felt fake, I might have enjoyed it more if the characters spoke Italian and the movie had subtitles. The promotion had no reasonable explanation. The love storyline felt a bit rushed. But the quirkiness,  humor and emotional moments made up for it's flaws. Really glad I watched it",1495756800,,617,4.712962962962963

1965062,4,B00011V8HW,"I've watched this movie a few times.  The script and acting are good and I enjoy the chemistry that the protagonist has with the upstairs neighbour.  The daughter, it seemed pretty forced but you eventually got through it.  It's a nice movie for a lazy afternoon and a movie that brings out your emotions.  Even though I don't care for the main actor, I think he did a good job in this film",1493769600,2,390,4.301369863013699

1965319,3,B00011V8HW,Cute story but action is slow and there are dead spots. In my opinion the story was all wrong and it cheapens many family values which are going down hill too fast. The story could work and still make no ill affect on societies.,1472774400,,228,4.204545454545454

1965338,3,B00011V8HW,"It could have done without the plethora of cuss words and the one bedroom scene. Other than that it was a charming movie.

1965768,5,B00011V8HW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  A Wedding for Bella is a story of a family, of love and of loss.  It is a story with heart.  The script is well written;  the characters have depth; and the acting is superb.  There are moments that will make you laugh out loud, and others that will find you fighting back tears.  I will definitely watch this one again.

Note:  This movie does include some colorful language, s*xual innuendos, and a mild s*x scene.  It is rated PG-13 for these reasons.  I would not watch it with my children who are 12 and 14.  Even without the aforementioned language and s*xuality, the content is, I think, too intense for tweens/young teens.  That said, I would recommend it to my adult friends who are looking for a well-acted movie with romance, comedy, and drama.",1455408000,5,788,4.55

1965782,4,B00011V8HW,Sweet story but not very realistic. The actors did a really good job and made their characters believable but the premise is where the story loses its believability.

1965792,4,B00011V8HW,"This is a movie that grew on me as I watched it. I almost didn't make it to the point of no return. At first, the poor acting will be foremost. Then it's the poor script for the people who speak Italian and partial English. ""Me no like"", seriously? I've known quite a few Italians in my time who did not speak fluent English, and I may have heard that once or twice, but certainly not repeatedly. Mario and Luigi had more accurate broken Italian one-liners, for Pete's sake.

But then the movie takes strides outside of the genre of cheap films. You see, most cheap films have a cliche plot that you've predicted by the end. Although it isn't revolutionary as a plot, it does go outside of the cliche parameters. The movie seems less about actors and more about the characters. It feels real, with real emotions and seems much less like Hollywood and more of what you'd see in real life. It was a pleasant feature to finish.",1454284800,4,924,4.4035087719298245

1965820,5,B00011V8HW,"This is definitely a movie to put on your watchlist. I loved it and thought it was brilliant! I just finished it for the second time and will watch it over and over for many years to come.

Dominic Pyzola, played by Scott Baio, is a corporate raider by day and an Italian pastry chef by night/early morning. The woman, Bella, who is the Pyzola brothers surrogate mother, lives above the bakery and is dearly loved by everyone. She is a heck of a woman, deeply loving her husband, daughter and the three Pyzola brothers. She lives her life in a very positive manner and chooses to be joyful and thankful always. It is a beautiful portrayal. Towards the beginning Bella becomes ill. We watch as Dominic tries to do whatever he can to make sure Bellas remaining time in this life is as happy and fulfilling as possible. Bella has always wanted to see her daughter married and Dominic schemes to get Bellas daughter to marry him for the sake of her mother.

I was so completely caught up in this movie and loved the closeness of the family, the romance, the sweetness, the genuine love that seemed to touch every one and they just didn't love but they loved deeply, beautifully, completely, unreservedly, and unconditionally.

One final observation: The actors were great and played their roles perfectly with emotion, love, strength, empathy, and much depth. Kudos to the fabulous Rosemary Prinz for her portrayal of the ill, but loving wife and mother, Bella. I would give anything to have a family member like her. She was brilliant!",1453593600,9,1532,4.687732342007435

She loved it especially the lecture he gave in the corporate boardroom about the processed junk food that they were munching on crap! Hopefully, the ""foodies"" that will be attracted to this film will realize that food is about life.  In one scene, Bella describes Dom's character to her daughter that he is like ""good bread.""

The cast, the dialogue, the plot, the cinematography, the humor, the pathos, the family love.... and, yes, the romance... all the best on many levels. I have never seen Scott Baio give such a strong and nuanced, manly performance. The central character, Bella, played by Rosemary Prinz to a joyous perfection, bound all the other characters together into a unified family wholeness. What a delightful Italian accent and beatific smile!
I get the comparison others make to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""Moonstruck"". In my mind and heart, this movie portrays the many of the same important themes to a greater depth, clarity, and truth than either of those. Half way through the movie, I found myself thinking Academy Award nominations for Best Movie, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor would have been in order the year this film was released.

Domi (Scott Baio) is a corporate ax man by day, and the best biscotti baker in the Strip by night.  He and his two brothers run a bakery below the apartment of an Italian couple who knew their parents.  One day Bella has Domi take her to the hospital, where he learns that she has terminal cancer.  He promises not to tell anyone and then promptly tells several neighbors in an attempt to locate Bella's daughter Lucca.  Love comes to the pair through their love for Bella.  It's beautiful and so true to life.  In a city like Pittsburgh, where people grow up, marry and live their lives in the same neighborhood this movie was like a tribute to the beauty of community.  Love your neighbor and as Pittsburgh's own Fred Rogers said, ""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood!""",1438560000,,890,4.5125

They went from a platonic relationship and grew into a committment to one another, not just for the matriarch's sake, but a growing, sweet, sentimental relationship. The supporting cast members making up  Baio's family were very good as well. Each had a memorable character trait which added to the story.

1966228,5,B00011V8HW,"This is a most delightful film.  It is wonderfully cast with each person playing his or her role to absolute perfection.  Scott Baio has really come into his own as an adult.  I enjoyed him as a youngster, but find his performances much more fully fleshed out now that he has matured into a young man.

He plays a frustrated baker who works in the corporate world by day and bakes biscotti by night.  He has two wonderful brothers who work with him in the bakery, one of whom suffers from some mild mental incapacity, and the other who sees himself as something of a ladies man.  All three are a very close warm family who have been looked after since the death of their parents by their upstairs neighbor, Bella and her husband.  Bella's daughter, Lucca is away in the Peace Corps.  She returns about mid-way during the film and plays a major role from that point onward.

For me, the star of this wonderful film is Bella herself.  This actress plays this role so perfectly that I believed her every nuance, her every twinkle, her every tear.  I felt as if she believed them too.

This film will make you laugh and cry and laugh all over again.  I would heartily recommend it.",1432857600,3,1177,4.4186046511627906

1966230,4,B00011V8HW,"This is certainly a surprise. All the cliche's of a script are in here and the conversations are forced, not in the acting but in the way it is written. That said, the acting was decent and the story itself is a charm. I kept thinking to myself, if this were rescripted and done with some better quality equipment, it would be absolutely fantastic. That said, no one could be Bella except for this Bella. And I cried through most of the second half of the movie. It is a surprise treasure and worth watching despite its flaws.",1432425600,,526,4.377551020408164
1966231,5,B00011V8HW,"I had never heard of this movie until I was searching for something fun to watch one evening.  RomCom is one of my favorite genres for 'fun' movies, the plot summary sounded intriguing, and I remember Scott Baio from the Joanie and Chachi days, so I gave it a look.

The male lead, Dominic, is a 'local boy makes good success story' who is portrayed as a rather likeable character throughout, rather than the stereotypical successful male who needs a good woman to show him he needs to have a heart as well as a brain.  There are hints given that his behavior in the past may not have been quite so likeable, but we don't see it on screen.  The female lead, Lucca, is brilliant yet incredibly insecure and sees herself as a quitter.  Dominic's two brothers, including the eldest brother Pino who is differently abled, are very different from him and yet they remain a tight-knit family.

While there were plenty of laugh out loud moments in the movie, there was a lot more depth to it than the usual RomCom.  The movie addressed issues like when is it okay to be less than totally honest with your family, do we choose who we love, is success always worth the cost, and what would you do to make someone else happy in creative ways.  No, there weren't a lot of unpredictable moments in this movie, but is that really why we watch RomComs?

If you want a movie that you can enjoy a lot while it also makes you think - I recommend A Wedding for Bella.",1432425600,,1449,4.356877323420075

Yes there are plenty of italian Americans who are not new yorkers! Then again Baio is from Bensonhurst the I-A epicenter. however this film does suffer from a low budget and all that it comes with: poor music score, poor lighting, poor audio, lack of camera angles, ect. And yes.... Kristen Minter is a terrible miscast for the part of bella...ewe.

But if you want a story about love of family and how far a man will go for the people he loves (in a good way) this is for you. There doesn't need to be a lot of overt sexual content to tell a beautiful story. Scott Baio does a wonderful job showing a warm and loving man, who does all that he can to give his second mom her last wish. I could watch this over and over.

I have a habit of buying some films without previously seeing them; most times I pick a keeper, but there are times when I would've been better off renting the movie. ""A Wedding for Bella"" has a sweet concept, but the execution of the film was painful to watch. The script was horrible, the pace was painstakingly slow and the ending left me wondering, ""What was the whole point of this movie?"" If it was supposed to be a heart-warming tear-jerker, the screenwriter and director missed their mark by a mile. The film was indeed a tear-jerker, but it left me feeling depressed and empty when it was over.

Since then, I have bought it a few times, to give to others and  -- most recently-- to have on my kindle to watch whenever I want. Of course, anyone with a Pittsburgh connection can't help but be drawn to this film...set in The Strip District (the warehouse food section of the 'Burgh and a foodie's dream) it shows the people of all backgrounds who happily and noisily inhabit alongside one another.

The core story, of a young man and his brothers plus an elderly Italian couple, is lovingly told with affectionate humor and grace. The acting is wonderful and the energy is warm and engaging.

The story mainly focuses on the friendship of neighbors: one a young man, the other, an older married couple, and mostly on the wife. The love interest with Scott Baio does not start until near the very end of the movie. The romance is brief and hurried with choppy scenes. The director gave no time for the romance to develop. The part of the story dealing with the older neighbor man's wife is touching and has a sad ending.

Another big question was about Bella.  She was supposed to be very sick, but would jump up an go when they were ready to go--until the very last.  Considering her diagnosis I don't think she could have possibly been so active 4 weeks later.  It just didn't ring true to me.

The plot, per se, was very good and the actors VERY believable. I really liked the movie.
HOWEVER, the DVD itself was poorly made. It blocked up, the sound quit working at oddball times, and there were several minutes of ""pixel chatter"" as if the movie was being transcribed onto the disk at less than the rotational speed of the disk. So, the movie, in itself, is a keeper, but the DVD will make you want to throw up, it's so poorly mastered.

Truly, these are our favorite things because we live them every day. And there were some things that were authentic:  Enrico Biscotti, the actual bakery; the Strip District; the beauty of the Pittsburgh skyline.  Unfortunately, there were too many things that were not authentic:  Several implausible story lines, bad Italian accents, gratuitous use of the word jagoff,  Scott Baio is still a good actor, and the girl who played Lucca was good, as was the woman who played Bella.  But the old man came off as vulgar even though they were going for more curmudgeonly, and the story of the brothers who become so close with their tenant (Bella) in such a short time just didn't ring true, even with some willing suspension of disbelief. It came off as a stereotype of what people think Italian families are like and didn't capture it in the way that other movies--such as Moonstruck--did.  I know this was a low-budget Indie film, but I had heard so much about it that I was anxious to see it.

I have NEVER before watched a ""Fake Marriage"" chick flick that was 1) predominately about the boy, 2) believably, even beautifully acted even when the scene could have become corny or cliche, 3) built on well rounded and well developed characters, or 4) based on an emotionally viable reason for two people to pretend to get married. I enjoyed this movie immensely. The humor was real and the drama was believable while the fake marriage was not over-analyzed nor the love story over-baked. It actually made this rather calloused viewer cry. If you like a sad-but-in-the-end-feel-good movie, I highly recommend ""A Wedding for Bella.""",1335830400,,1315,4.875

His devotion to Bella, his ""substitute"" Mom, is real and his disgust with his other life as a corporate hatchet man dissolves with that commitment to Bella who is seriously ill.  The rapport between the brothers in spite of their differences, the kindness with which he cares for and respects Pino, the eldest and disabled, is very moving.  I loved this film for its story line, the ethnic and religious generosity with which the world occupied by the characters is portrayed; the texture of the place and time (you can smell the biscotti and bread baking) deserves more attention.  I found this film by accident through Amazon Prime and I am very glad I did.  The one confusing thing is that this film appears to have two titles - a mistake for successful distribution and marketing.

If - apart from not having a love for good quality food and meal time you like high-budget films full of special effects and big, big, big events... you may not enjoy another very good thing about this movie, which is to simply tell a beautiful story without unnecessary shots.

If, moreover, you have small imaginations and cannot read between lines, have a need to see strong pictures in order to move you - you may not like the third great part of the movie which touches the soul without showing unnecessary details of suffering, death or blood.

BUT if you come from a home where people enjoy: good quality food and family/friend meal time, where they love and accept their family  the way they are, where they appreciate beautiful stories told simply and with respect to others feeling, and if your parents read and talked to you when you were a child and you have imagination big enough to imaging the burial without it being shown - you are going to enjoy this movies a lot.

And if you - like me - come from the country where a food is a great passion but people know limits of what and how much to eat, and you - like me - still look in disbelieve (and sometimes in disguised) at some super obese  people in United States hardly moving their own body but entering a subway with 1 liter big sweet ice-coffee with whipped cream on top and package of donuts or a box of low-quality family-size pizza - you will understand the main character disgust watching people eating junk.",1326412800,,1951,4.435754189944134

1966353,4,B00011V8HW,"I'm one of the few people who got to see this in a movie theatre when it was released in a theatre in Pittsburgh, and I recently bought it for the DVD library for my bed and breakfast.

Dom (Scott Baio) and his two brothers run a bakery and are surrogate children for the tenants who live upstairs, an older Italian couple, Bella and Mossimo.  When Dom discovers that his beloved Bella is ill, he concocts a plot to marry her daughter, despite the fact that he's never even met her.

Overall, the movie is not perfect, and a few of the scenes, particularly those shot in Dom's office, are amateurish.  But you can forgive the movie these few missteps when you see the main characters on the screen, particularly Rosemary Prinz as Bella.

You will also reconsider what you think of Scott Baio as an actor.  He has a subtly-nuanced performance that is way out of his usual role as a heart throb.  As Dom, he's literally torn between two worlds:  the corporate world of power, big bucks, and giant ego, and the bakery, where flour, eggs, and butter come together to make magic.

You also get a slice of what life is like for business owners in the Pittsburgh neighborhood ""the strip"" - a neighborhood that teems with shops, restaurants, and yes, Biscotti shops.

1966357,4,B00011V8HW,"Who would've thunk it, that Scott Baio had it in him to be so good? A WEDDING FOR BELLA features a Scott Baio who is ages removed from his TV heartthrob days of HAPPY DAYS and CHARLES IN CHARGE. Here, he plays Dominic Pyzola, a work-obsessed Italian-American holding down two contrasting gigs. By day, he's a merciless corporate executive, handling mergers and a cold-hearted ace at firing employees. Then he lets his hair down and toils at the biscotti bakery he runs jointly with his two brothers. The heart of the film lies in Dominic scheming to marry the wayward daughter of Bella, an elderly, terminally-ill woman who dwells above the bakery. Bella has been like a mother for the Pyzola boys, and her fondest wish has always been for her independent daughter to finally settle down and start a family. Dominic means to make Bella's wish come true, before she passes on.

A WEDDING FOR BELLA is an unassuming little film with occasional eruptions of color and joviality. It steeps itself in expansive Italian-American culture, yet the characters are played by the actors with enough earnestness and sensitivity that they don't feel too much like caricatures. The film unveils quiet moments which impact on an emotional level and a romance which is lowkey and begins as a contrivance yet ends up being real enough. I thought Kristen Minter as Lucca, Bella's flighty, contrary daughter, was splendid, with wonderfully natural reactions. Rosemary Prinz plays Bella, who decides to live the ""six good months"" left her with grace and dignity. Prinz is well-cast in the role, although she does come off as too cloying at times. But it was actually a heartrending moment when, after weeks and weeks of cheerfully toughing it out, Bella at last voices her agony. The supporting cast is laudable, especially Shuler Hensley as Pino, the half-witted brother, and John Seitz as Massimo, the half-crazed husband.

It's a simple story, with a plot gimmick which stretches credibility some. So credit Scott Baio with underplaying his character to very good effect, as he makes Dominic's crazy scheme actually seem realistic and workable. And, while a weepy, sad, and bittersweet drama, there's still room here for humorous moments, mostly brought about by the three brothers interacting and by the antics of Massimo, who is a great gruff man.

A WEDDING FOR BELLA isn't a glossy, big budget production. It even seems amateurish, at times. Yet it has a way of eliciting quiet tears and contemplative silences. Even the ""big"" moments are arrived at without flourish. When Dominic proposes to Lucca, as family members look on, there isn't a grand, rousing speech. The speech he makes is simple and direct, and the question is bluntly proposed. The whole thing is actually a bit awkward, which to me makes it more endearing. A WEDDING FOR BELLA triumphs in its celebration of family ties and a steadfast clinging to ethnic roots. And in Bella's gradual yet defiant decline, it manages to be quietly life-affirming. So, no, A WEDDING FOR BELLA isn't a glossy, big budget production. But it is a good movie.",1211414400,2,3091,4.940384615384615

I happened to enjoy ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and this film is a bad attempt to replicate that film.

My wife and I sat down to watch this hoping it would be as good as the reviews on the cover. Not even close! I watched about 40 minutes of it and gave up. So to be fair, I did not watch the entire movie. I simply couldn't stomach it. My wife did and reported to me that it never really improved any.

The editing and overall pace was clumsy and awkward. The story seemed forced and absurd. The acting was at times good, but the dialogue was so bad the actors looked silly. When the film attempted to be funny, I actually was embarrassed for the filmmakers because it was NEVER funny. The characters were also unlikeable. The lady that was dying seemed nice enough, but they jump into her ordeal so early in the story that it was hard to feel any serious sympathy because we don't know the character well enough. The woman's husband acts like a jerk and I guess it was supposed to be endearing, but it wasn't. It was irritating. The main character violates the wishes of this dying woman by blabbing about her problem to everyone and then gets mad when they do the same. He also, for some reason, gets a little nuts when he sees people eating cheap food. And then the whole premise of pretending to love and marry someone as one last lie to a dying woman was kind of disturbing. And on and on...

Sorry, but this film left a sickening and awkward feeling during and after viewing it. The only thing my wife and I got out of it was we talked for about an hour later that night about how bad this movie was.",1203206400,4,1671,4.183229813664596

Long story short - this is a keeper.  A surprise movie.  Something only a few of us lucky ones will get to see.  Unless, of course, we share it with our friends.

The actors/characters seem to have fallen in love with each other in real life and for the movie.  The dialog seems ad-libbed at times, which makes it so cute.  The dialog is salty, sweet, tender and real.  You wish you really knew these people.

Please do check out this movie.  Pretty much assured, you will find something so peaceful with this movie.  The way ""real life"" should be.  Loving, kind, caring, gentle.

Considering my husband is a Star Wars/Sci Fi kind of guy, he really enjoyed this movie.  It was something different for him - he found it very non-violent.  And in this world, that's hard to come by.  It was a light, fun movie with funky characters.

1966371,5,B00011V8HW,"Call it ""My Big Fat Italian Wedding,"" but with more love, bittersweetness, family feeling, and pastry. ""A Wedding for Bella"" or ""The Bread, My Sweet""  has a big heart, narrowly avoiding the oversweetness of such movies. It's a romantic comedy, a tragedy, and a warm tale about family.

Domi (Scott Baio) is a corporate bigwig by day, but owns a bakery that he runs with his two brothers. He has also ""adopted"" an elderly Italian couple, the grumpy Massimo (John Seitz) and loving Bella (Rosemary Prinz). But one day Bella takes Domi to the hospital, revealing that she has terminal cancer. But she orders him not to tell anyone -- because ""I no gonna start dying until I'm ready."" But she obviously wishes she could see her wayward daughter Lucca (Kristin Minter) be married.

So Domi quietly tries to contact Lucca, only to have her turn up at Christmas dinner. Within a day, he proposes to her -- just so Bella can see her daughter be married, even if he expects Lucca to go her own way once her mother is dead. Lucca and Domi start awkwardly getting to know one another, all the time hoping that Bella will live to see them wed.

A lot of movies would have lapsed into silly cliches. But as someone of Italian ancestry, I can say honestly that a lot of Italians are like the people of this film: they ""got a scream,"" argue and insult, and yet they're generous and loving to everybody. And love food. Even the broken English Bella and Massimo speak never crosses the line into parody.

But what makes ""A Wedding for Bella"" so enchanting is that it's not just about a wedding or romance. It's also about love and family, and about living your life to the fullest. It's impossible not to be moved as Bella states that she's going to keep living -- not just surviving -- for as long as possible, and tries to do that. And somehow, this movie manages to do it without sinking into sticky-sweetness.

The story mainly focuses on the very weird courtship between Lucca and Domi, and again it manages not to be soppy or cliched -- one scene has them exchanging questionnaires and information. It's awkward, and it's supposed to be. But even with terminal illnesses and faux weddings, ""Wedding"" has comedy too, such as the three brothers and Massimo goofing around at the tux fitting.

The star performance of this is undoubtedly Prinz as the dying Bella. She exudes warmth, kindness and a quiet strength. It's easy to see why everyone loves her. There are also stellar performances from Baio and Minter, who make the transition from self-arranged fiancees to lovers believable, and Seitz, who gives the crabby Massimo plenty of heart. And ""Van Helsing's"" Shuley Hensley gives the most underrated performance of the film as Domi's retarded brother, who loves Bella dearly.

""A Wedding for Bella"" (""The Bread, My Sweet"") a story about celebrating life, and about love -- between lovers, spouses, and brothers. This tiny film is like bread -- good in every way.",1104278400,116,2953,4.687258687258687

1966373,4,B00011V8HW,"A WEDDING FOR BELLA (aka THE BREAD, MY SWEET) is lovely little low budget film that demonstrates how tender the heart can be without the need for big time stars or production values. This film as directed by Melissa Martin reminds us that quiet slices of life in middle America have as much if not more cinematic validity that the big blockbusters.  Briefly, Dominic (a very fine Scott Baio!) and his two brothers are bakers and have adopted an older couple (Bella portrayed with understated simplicity and warmth by Rosemary Prinz and Massimo portrayed by John Seitz) as family.  Dominic wears two hats: he is a successful businessman in the mid Pittsburgh district but spends as much time with his brothers in the family bakery.  Dominic and Bella are especially close and when it is discovered that Bella has terminal cancer, Dominic sets out to find her 'estranged' daughter Lucca (Kristin Minter) who everybody thinks is an unloving carefree beatnik in Mexico.  Lucca arrives and with her comes the truth - that she graduated Law School with honors, was disillusioned, left Pittsburgh to be in the Peace Corps to help others, became disillusioned and ended up selling junk art to tourists in Mexico. Her reason for return is not in response to Dominic's pleas (she never got the messages), but to her own need to reunite with the mother whom she adores. Bella's secret wish is that Lucca be happily married and have children, but she also is a wise enough mother to know that her daughter must choose her own life.  Dominic decides that the thing that would make Bella happy before she succumbs to her cancer is for Dominic and Lucca to marry!  Their intentions thrill Bella and the 'extended family' all concentrate on the energies of wedding preparation to offset Bella's impending demise. The way this all plays out in the end is the meaningful part and to reveal that would not be fair.  Suffice it to say that the actors carry off multiple levels of interpersonal relationships, touching on the comedy, the tragedy and the warmth of these marvelous Italian American characters.  Yes, the film wears its heart on its sleeve, but who's to say that is wrong?  A feel good movie of taste and promise.",1094083200,6,2206,4.78421052631579

The movie is sweet, with the connection of family being at the forefront of the story.  The movie is romantic, with this strong hero taking care of those around him, almost to his detriment (and oh yes, Ladies, Scott Baio is excellent, I mean excellent in this film).  The movie is sexy, the chemistry between the hero and heroine is amazing, and I've decided to catalogue one of the lines in my little black book (""You're killing me..."").  I'm a sucker for romance and love, and this definitely delivers.  FYI:  the DVD comes with very few bonus materials, it's pretty much just the movie.  That kinda sucks because after you watch the movie, you want to learn more about it.  Also, the movie does end a little abruptly, but that may just be a matter of personal taste.

And believe me, it is strictly a DVD/video release company doing, not the producer's doing. All-in-all, this film is not to be missed. Believe me, it is worth it.",1079395200,5,1035,4.395833333333333

8005224,4,B00011V8HW,"Touching tale of two people who do something totally crazy and totally selfless to make a dying old woman's wish come true and end up discovering something wonderful between them.  Excellent acting!  Scott Baio and Kristin Minter put in 100% believable performances (Baio's relationship with his mentally slow older brother, Shuler Hensley, is noteworthy, in itself).  The vulgar language (e.g., jack-off) and locker-room sexual innuendo may be offensive to some, but the story is so tender, you can excuse some of the minor drawbacks.  If you can get past the smutty language, the movie is well worth the watch.  And it doesn't hurt if you come from an Italian background; it's very believable.",1518825600,,695,5.115044247787611
