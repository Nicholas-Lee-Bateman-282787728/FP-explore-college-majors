3994338,3,B002VD5RY8,"The film takes a long time to engage the viewer and traffics in mostly stock characters so we're rarely emotionally involved. Interesting, though. And with some good actors who's talents unfortunately aren't tested.",1324684800,,215,5.545454545454546
3994339,5,B002VD5RY8,"Very interesting view of the actions of freedom fighters in France. Most people do not know how bad the Jewish citizens had it in France. Many French did help them,but many did not. I suppose that this could be stated about various nations. Things were more than convoluted then.

These fighters did not worry about just fighting back they did so until captured.",1312761600,,362,4.746031746031746

3994341,5,B002VD5RY8,"Great movie about the resistence - especially the fact it demonstrates how in the beginning (before it was clear the Germans would lose WWII) the ""cooperation"" that existed between the French authorities and the Germans.  In fact, the movie makes a point when one SS office states how the French authorities did things the Germans themselves would have been cautious about doing.

This movie while highlighting the contibutions of the foreign immigrants in France to help fight against Nazism, helps put to rest the myth that all the French were part of the underground or actively working against the Nazi occupation.

In fact, the first year of occupation there was very little resistance activity - it only started in earnest after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June, 1941.  In the beginning, a high percentage of the underground were communists who initiated this fight in solidarity with the Soviet Union.

IN this movie, the brave souls portrayed who were not born in France took up arms and fought - and died - to protect that country - even if it meant fighting against the French born collaborators.  This fight eventually cost them their lives and their recognition for their services and sacrifices needs to be acknowledged - something this film does very well.",1301529600,37,1278,4.9485981308411215

3994346,5,B002VD5RY8,"Robert Gudiguians The Army of Crime traces the beginnings of the French Resistance movement during World War II, focusing on the true story of Missak Manouchian (Simon Abkarian), an Armenian poet, and his wife Mline (Virginie Ledoyen), who led their ragtag but effective number, consisting of non-French Jews, Communists, anti-Fascist Italians and others.  ""The Army of Crime"" puts a human face on this group of outsiders who fought with fierce personal conviction against France's occupying oppressors. The Armenian flavor the director provides in Manouchians family scenes brings added color and sheds new light on the impact of the Occupation on foreign residents of France at the time. The story points up the crushing effects of French collaborators who contributed to the actual group's demise following the arrest of their leader",1474848000,3,836,5.430769230769231

3994349,5,B002VD5RY8,"the opening scene, when some of the resistance fighters are in a police van speaking to each other of their worries for others, driving through Paris, past all of that nation's citizens who did nothing, driving to their death, while over their dialog is the audio of the years later commemoration of a memorial to them and their comrades, with ""died for France"" following each name; that scene alone makes for my this film five star; when it was on Netflix I would rerun this part and be overcome emotionally each time",1459555200,,518,4.641304347826087
3994350,3,B002VD5RY8,"Its a workmanlike film--goes through all the hoops for the genre, but just doesn't have the tension and empathy for the characters we need.  Perhaps something is lost in the translation.  A big part of the movie should have been not just the animosity towards the Germans, but even more towards the French traitors of the Vichy government.  This is non-existent.  Given the high ratings I expected much more.",1443571200,,408,4.869565217391305

3994355,2,B002VD5RY8,"First it is not comparable to ""Inglorious Bastards"" as its box implies.  It is a tragic story, true or untrue.  But it is a story of certain people during the World War (1939-1945) who refuse to organize and thus their loose connections was their ""Achilles heal.""  they say the a chain is as strong as its weakest link.  Had the one woman not fallen for the lies of the French investigator who wowed her, or had the one principal leader not willingly given out all of their names, none would have been caught.  I found the plot of this film too predictable and the conclusion inevitable to say the least.  Unfortunately, I found this out only after purchasing the DVD sight unseen and based upon reviews found on the IMDb website (which isn't all that accurate in its reviews).  It is yet another ""lemon"" for my ""lemon collection.""  However, Christmas is coming.  Perhaps this film amongst other lemons will make the prefect gift to the unsuspecting.",1381795200,,950,4.674698795180723
3994356,5,B002VD5RY8,"I've watched this film several times. Each time I get inspired by the courage of these ""outcasts"" of French society during World War II. This little known true story deserved to have a great film made about it - and this is that film.",1375920000,10,234,4.340909090909091
3994357,2,B002VD5RY8,"The partisans in this movie are so appealing and the French collaborators so despicable, that there are no shades of grey in this depiction of the armed resistance that the Nazis called an Army of Crime. Thats a pity, because if there ever was a time when shades of grey predominated, it was surely life in occupied Paris. The film is less than forthright about the circumstance that the fighters were under Communist Party discipline and may well have been betrayed by the Party, a possibility explored in the documentary Terrorists in Retirement, about the same group.",1363478400,3,570,4.88659793814433
3994358,5,B002VD5RY8,"this is the French Resistance in it's harsh, black and white reaction to occupation by Nazi's. no one comes close to this kind of reality anymore. they all dumb it down, or try to put a love story in the middle of the really ugly business of killing oppressors.",1362528000,7,261,4.346938775510204
3994359,4,B002VD5RY8,"- This movie creates a very intense mood.

- There are quite a  few suspenseful scenes.

- The actors convincingly depict  the courage and the fanaticism of French Resistance fighters in WWII

- It's inspired by true characters. The ending is factual but depressing.

In short, it's definitely worth watching. I borrowed it from the local library.",1349395200,4,347,5.0

3994361,4,B002VD5RY8,"An excellent film depicting the early resistance movement in Nazi-occupied France. ""L'Arme du crime"" (""Army of Crime"") from 2009 was directed by Robert Gediguian, and starred Simon Abkarian and Virginie Ledoyen. The film showed that the early resistance movement in France (1940-1941) was led to no small degree by foreign nationals. Missak Manouchian (Simon Abkarian) was not your average guerilla or partisan (he was a poet and a 'conscientious objector') his family was killed in the Armenian holocaust at the hands of the Turks (with the full complicity of Great Britain and the U.S.)! While many of the resistance fighters had their personal and idealistic reasons (many were Jewish and members of the Communist party), they seemed to be genuinely committed to freeing their adopted country from the Nazis. What I liked best about this film (like ""Flame and Citron""), was its real condemnation of war (Missak in a farewell letter to his wife, said he didn't even hate the Germans or anyone else for that matter. This was a real testament to his humanity). War is a crime, plain and simple! Let's hope and pray that future generations will never have to know such suffering! NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 133 mins. BTW: I also recommend ""L'Arme des ombres"" (""Army of Shadows"") 1969 and ""Flammen & Citronen"" (""Flame and Citron"") 2008.

8381928,5,B002VD5RY8,"It is one of my sincerest of wishes that everyone would educate themselves more about the German atrocities committed during WWII and understand just how important life and happiness really are. This film, ""Army of Crime"" is about French freedom fighters and the sacrifices they made. In the message of the movie, forgiveness is stressed as a part of the coming peace process, however, based on what I have seen, I would not have lost a minute of sleep if the Vichy French and the rest of the repulsive, cowardly Nazi collaborators were all rounded up as traitors after the war, tried for treason and crimes against humanity and summarily deported, imprisoned, tortured and/or executed for the crimes they perpetrated against their own people. Only then, could a satisfactory peace reign. This is a must-see film for anyone interested in World War II.",1507852800,2,851,4.958041958041958
