7802909,4,6163400054,"Korean film audiences have long had a fascination with romantic comedies enmeshed in a cinematic universe where time travel intersects with the supernatural. In OPERATION PROPOSAL director Kim Wu-sun deftly combines romance with the inevitable philosophical vagaries inherent in time travel. During the course of the film's sixteen episode run, Kim Woo-sun creates an imaginative vision that encompasses the results of a time traveler seeking to return to the past to avoid the errors made so as to reshape the present into a form more to his liking. The plot is a Korean melding of the Hollywood duo of GROUNDHOG DAY with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

  Kang Baek-ho (Yoo Seung-ho) is a professional baseball player who has had a twenty year unrequited crush on a childhood playmate Ham Yi-seul (Park Eun-bin). They are inseparable playmates from middle school to high school and beyond. He refuses to confess his feelings for reasons that inexplicably range from creeping insecurity to a fear that confessing will somehow mess up their friendship all the way to assuming that all she offers is friendship and nothing else. Then the inevitable happens. Ham Yi-seul meets a handsome, wealthy, and well-mannered Kwon Jin-won (Lee Hyun-jin), a baseball coach who has no problem confessing his love. Ham Yi-seul accepts him and they agree to marry. Up to this point, the plot is a straight forward romance with an element of tragedy thrown in. Kang Baek-ho is crushed and from nowhere appears a magical being who refers to himself as a ""time conductor."" This conductor (Kim Tae-hoon) gives Kang Baek-ho a magic potion to drink, the result of which whisks him back to the past so he may open up his heart to his beloved. Only it is not as easy as that. He fails to do so. The time conductor gives Kang Baek-ho several chances to set matters straight, but the result is always dismally the same.  The problem as we slowly discover lies not in rearranging the past but in reordering one's own inner self.

  For much of the movie, I felt like grabbing Kang Baek-ho by his lapels and shouting: ""Tell her you love her, you procrastinating jerk!"" I was convinced my frustration was due to his internal failure to confront his own reticence. Then slowly as the series neared the end, I could see a logical purpose for that reticence. Kang Baek-ho was not as nearly as reticent as he thought. The same insecurities that confounded him also wreaked havoc with Ham Yi-seul. Her marriage ceremony to Kwon Jin-won was approached, began, and delayed so often that the nuptials emerged as the unifying motife holding together the various strands of an altered time line. Time travel films often place an altered past as central to the plot in that changing the past does more than changing the present. It also erases or alters human memory. There were more than a few points in this film that as events changed there should also have been no corresponding carry-over of memory. But OPERATION PROPOSAL uses fantasy and time travel as a means to propel the plot not as a thesis for an abstruse scholarly article.  As with most Korean romantic dramas, this film had the requisite subplots of parallel pairings of thwarted lovers much as in one of Shakespeare's early comedies. It also contained a solid grounding in Korean respect for one's elders and the absolute need to work Within the System to achieve one's goals. To viewers who, like myself, felt impatience with Kang Baek-ho's refusal to question his inner conflicts, I suggest patience on your part as the ending which I shall not here reveal made the various crossings from past to present worth the wait.",1471046400,,3640,4.85024154589372
