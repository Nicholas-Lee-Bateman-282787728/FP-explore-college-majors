8476417,5,B005K271BO,"This 11 disc boxset provides us with the first half of episodes of A Country Practice first screened in Australia in 1986.
Two of the original cast departed the show in 1985 and it may have been wondered if the show could continue without them. Annie Davies (Kelly) and Nick Bufalo (Ben) provide two of the replacements and seem to fit in well with the rest of the regulars.
As usual a whole host of guest artists appear during this set, recognisable from other Australian soap operas from the era including Prisoner: Cell Block H's Kim Deacon, Prisoner / Richmond Hil's Tim Elston, Prisoner / Hopme and Away / Blue Heelers' Debra Lawrance among many others.
Yes there are some silly storylines from time to time but the programme was nnot afraid to tackle issues of the day. It's less of a soap opera than it's rival Sons and Daughters and Prisoner as most stories are self-contained within two episodes. These episodes were mnade in Sydney from late 1985 onwards, at the same timne as bosses at Sydney's Seven Network decided to axe the Melbourne produced Neighbours in favour of Sons and Daughters and A Country Practice.
This set also features the final episodes of Grant Dodwell and Shane Withington as Dr Simon Bowen and Brendan Jones.
