8728391,2,B013P6PCGC,"the main issue with the DVD is with the combo of Sex Tape and The Sweetest thing as it had no chapters for it.

Sex tape was too tame for the story.should have been more raunchy and Cameron Diaz did a lot more sexual stuff in movies before AND after this.
good examples was The Sweetest Thing.

Bad Teacher had a good story to it. the comedy and raunchiness to it was good . could have been better

The Sweetest thing was excellent. Christina Applegate did the most sexual role of her life in this one.",1465603200,,502,4.208333333333333
8728392,3,B013P6PCGC,"I purchased this movie pack specifically for The Sweetest Thing. Quality wise, the movie was clear as expected. However, there were a few scenes that were missing from the movie. Specifically the scene where the three girls are in the Chinese Restaurant, and they sing the P***s Song. This scene is one of my favorites, however, it was omitted from the movie.

Overall, my experience with this movie pack has been mediocre. I have yet to watch the other two films, but I can expect them to have certain scenes missing.",1463702400,3,518,4.6923076923076925
