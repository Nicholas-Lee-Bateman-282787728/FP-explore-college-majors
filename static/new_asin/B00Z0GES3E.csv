7269956,5,B00Z0GES3E,"This movie was fabulous, both for Campbell fans and those with family members with Alzheimer's. I can remember where I was and what I was doing the first time I heard ""Wichita Lineman"" . I think I must have played that song 100 times in a row.",1440374400,4,243,4.191489361702128
7269957,5,B00Z0GES3E,"As a long-time Glen Campbell fan, I had the pleasure of seeing Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me twice last year in the theater when it was first released.  Unfortunately, this touching, heartwarming documentary was only released to select theaters across the country despite being one of the best films to hit theaters in 2014. It was just recently aired on CNN for those who missed this fantastic movie in the theater last year. In a modern era when too many contemporary Hollywood creations emphasize morbid guts and gore images that serve to disturb and offend more than educate and inspire, this is a refreshing movie of soul and substance that is well worth your time and money. Make no mistake, this is not a movie for only Glen Campbell/country music fans....it is a must-see film for any person with a heart and soul who enjoys a true heartfelt story of the human experience.

Directed by filmmaker James Keach, I'll Be Me documents Campbell's Alzheimer's diagnosis and his final goodbye concert tour of 2011/12.  The movie provides an up close and personal glimpse of Campbell on stage and behind the scenes with his wife Kim and children Shannon, Cal, and Ashley who back him on stage as members of his touring band.  As Campbell becomes the first performer to ever launch a concert tour while battling Alzheimer's disease, we watch the endless support of his family and fans who show him their love and encouragement as he struggles with the disease that is slowly robbing him of his memory and ability to perform effectively on tour.

Director James Keach does a nice job of capturing many funny and positive moments on camera that keep this from becoming the overly dark, depressing movie it could have easily been in the hands of another Hollywood director. Glen's down home country boy charm and humor shines throughout the film and the love and support shown by Kim Campbell as well as Glen's friends and fans turns the movie into a heartwarming experience despite the sad nature of the subject matter. For those who grew up seeing the confident, charismatic performer that Glen was in his prime, the second half of this movie will be hard to watch for many fans. You will see raw intimate moments of Glen struggling badly with his memory loss in private interactions with his family that add power and grit to the film. By the time his final concert performance comes around in late 2012, we watch Glen struggle to make it through a single song on stage.

The movie features many well-known and some surprising faces including Bruce Springsteen, Larry Gatlin, The Edge, Keith Urban, Paul McCartney, Jay Leno, Taylor Swift, and even President Clinton among many others who all pay their respects on camera to this true legend of American music.  Glen's daughter Ashley {an up and coming musician in her own right} gave a tearful speech before congress last year about this disease and this footage is also featured in the movie. Also included in the film are two of the best new songs to appear on the music scene in the last year, Ashley Campbell's touching tribute to her dad ""Remembering"", and Glen's final studio recording, ""I'm not gonna miss you"" that won a grammy this year.  We see historic footage of Glen recording the song in early 2013 with members of the legendary ""Wrecking Crew"" which included Campbell himself in the 1960's who played guitar on countless pop and country records, including Frank Sinatra's ""Strangers in the night"" and the Beach Boys classic Pet Sounds album.

Glen was sadly sent to live in a care home in April 2014 as his memory has now faded too severely to live independently.  I had a real personal interest in this movie as my grandmother also suffered from Alzheimer's disease 20 years ago.  I remember visiting her in New York when her memory was completely gone and she didn't know who we were anymore.  Much attention has been given to Robin Williams' mental illness that resulted in his recent death.  Glen's illness is yet another mental disease with no cure that affects many people every year. This documentary should serve to not only renew public interest in Alzheimer's disease, but will hopefully wake up the younger generation to a living legend of American music who, like too many others, deserves more media attention than he has gotten in the last 20 years. Thank you Glen for your golden legacy of talent and your major contribution to both American music and Alzheimer's awareness...

Do yourself a favor and add this DVD to your collection!  Watch it with your family and be moved by the kind of poignant, uplifting movie experience we need more of in today's world.  With so many overrated, overhyped Hollywood flicks on the market today, I'll Be Me is the REAL DEAL.  Glen Campbell's memory and legacy will live on thanks to all who took part in the making this very worthy film.",1439337600,4,4849,4.7673031026252985
7269958,5,B00Z0GES3E,"My sister has Alzheimer's and it's really hard to explain to someone what her son is going through caring for her. This documentary is a wonderful glimpse into that world. The Campbell family has done a really brave thing here by making it a truly uplifting journey through the trials and tribulations that is Alzheimer's disease. Glen Campbell's amazing music and performances shine throughout, and it is for this he will always be remembered, not for his decline. But for his fans who wondered what he has been doing these last few years, well, her he is. The guest celebrities who speak about their loved ones with the disease also brought tears to my eyes.",1436832000,2,660,4.747826086956522

7269960,5,B00Z0GES3E,"Although Ive never been a huge fan of Glen Campbell, I acknowledge him as an undisputed, unmistakable icon. Hes always been a solid performer, even to almost the very end, which is captured on film in the extremely touching, moving, and ultimately life-affirming documentary, Glen Campbell: Ill Be Me, currently playing on CNN.

The picture follows Campbell and his family as they prepare for a U.S. tour to promote his album Ghost on the Canvas. However, just before they hit the road, they receive the devastating diagnosis that Campbell is suffering from the early onset of Alzheimer's disease.

What ensues is an intimate, no-holds-barred look at a man who fights with every ounce of his dignity and pride to deliver for his loving family and his devoted fans, one last time.

Now billed as the Goodbye Tour, the cross-country jaunt sees Campbell experience both triumphs and trials, with the musical road trip also serving as a journey of self-discovery.

Watching this legend struggle with this debilitating illness is humbling, and yet watching him bask in the unconditional love of his adoring audiences, even as he falters, provides an emotionally rejuvenating catharsis.

I thought viewing this film would leave me with sadness, and at times it can be disheartening. But no film, television program, or music album in recent years has brought a bigger smile to my face than this documentary has. This is the feel-good movie of the year, and definitely one of the most positive, heartwarming films of all time.

Highlights include onstage and backstage at The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, interviews with family and friends, and, of course, the music.

As of this writing, Glen Campbell is living in a memory support community, where he is receiving the care he needs, with his family close by. This documentary couldn't have come at a better time, ensuring his legacy for posterity.

Appreciate this man now, while hes still with us, at least physically.

Do the same for your loved ones.",1435881600,17,1997,4.990963855421687

This is a documentary that is must-see viewing, whether or not you are a fan of Glen Campbell, because it shines a spotlight on one of the biggest health crises facing all of us in the 21st century.",1435622400,11,558,5.142857142857143

It is real, it is funny, it is sad, and it is educational.  Whether you like Glen Campbell and want to see him again, or if you have a loved one with Alzheimer this is a wonderful way to learn about this disease.  As a caregiver of someone who has Alzheimer I was lifted up by the honesty of good days and tough days, the devotion of friends and family, and above all the music of his guitar and his voice that never left him but rather lifted him up.
It is not by Bill Clinton, though.  Bill Clinton is just one of the people who speak about Glen Campbell, as did musicians, family and friends.",1434412800,25,715,4.227941176470588

He and his family go out and they nurse him through over one hundred concerts. He visits doctors as his conditions worsens. Interviews with famous people and fans.

7269992,5,B00Z0GES3E,"Glen Campbell has worn so many hats in his lifetime - musician, songwriter, actor, session musician, family man and American icon.  He bravely invited us in to share his final days with Alzheimer's Disease as he says his goodbyes to his adoring public, fellow artists and family members.  The documentary pays tribute to his legacy without fawning over him or complaining about the unfairness of such talent slowly losing itself minute by minute.  It's a worthy tribute as well as a portrait of the soul-stealing horror that is this disease.

Thank you, Glen, for all you've been to your fans and fellow artists.  Thanks to the Campbell family for letting us into their living room one last time.",1506902400,,696,4.864406779661017

I highly recommend this video as one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is also very sad to see such a talented man have to endure such a horrible disease. However, it is also fascinating to see Glen unable to remember the words to songs he wrote, but still able to play all the guitar licks at the many concerts he performed as his Alzheimer's progressed. I have heard the first thing the human brain can learn is music and it is the last thing the brain loses. As Keith Urban says in the video: ""life is about memories"". Thanks to Glen's wife who wanted this documentary produced, you are able to share in Glen Campbell's amazing journey with Alzheimer's.

7270005,5,B00Z0GES3E,"The title captures the essence of Alzheimer's: you are not you as the disease accelerates. The album title of his last tour ""Ghost on the Canvas"" is what happens to the person with Alzheimers: they become a ghost of their former self. I thought it was very amazing that Glen's family would so openly share their journey this way. Written words would be inadequate to describe the course and effect, so a movie is far better way to show it. I did not find the movie depressing because the family and Glen's team are supporting his effort to do the concert. It was wonderful to see ""Glen be Glen"" when he was performing, and multiple times doctors said that the tour was actually helping Glen's brain function better, slowing down the pace of the disease.
My father lived with Alzheimer's 9 years, and the ways that Glen did not or could not answer questions were very familiar. The movie is an incredible testimony of Glen's musical gifts overcoming the challenges of his condition, with the loving help of his family. Now that he has died, it will continue to tell his story and the story of many others facing Alzheimers.",1503964800,,1122,4.615

It follows Glen and his family during 2011-1012 after his Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed. He and his family made the decision to do a farewell tour which was initially supposed to last 5 weeks, but ended up with 151 tour dates all over the country. I was amazed that in spite of what Alzheimer's was doing to Glen in his daily life, he could still appear on stage and play those amazing guitar solos and perform all his big hits. You will meet his wife Kim who I gained a huge respect for as well as their three kids, Cal, Shannon and Ashley who perform with him on tour and are all very talented musicians in their own right. There's no doubt what a huge Daddy's girl Ashley is- the loving relationship between the two of them is apparent and a highlight in the film is their Dueling Banjos duet. You will laugh at Glen's humor and you will cry because of what this insidious disease did to him, but you'll be inspired by a family that banded together to share with the world the effects of Alzheimers and fought to give his fans a last goodbye.

The documentary also shows the love others had for him, not to mention the respect many in the music industry did.  More than anything, it makes us look at Alzheimer's, and allows us to wonder what more can be done.  A must, even if you are not interested in the music industry.",1502582400,,591,4.20353982300885

Radio pop top ten. Then I caught an older broadcast of ""Later With Jools Holland"". Glen Campbell was an AMAZING guitar player, which most people don't realise. He played ""Galveston"" on that Jools Holland show and it floored me. you can prob find it on youtube. That is EXACTLY the essence of this movie. Very unexpected Gem, with a predictable outcome.

7270072,5,B00Z0GES3E,"This is a documentary on the later years of Glen Campbell, his career and his battle with Alzheimer's.  It follows him around at home, during concerts and rehearsals and most heart-breaking, his doctor's appointments.  I'm a long time Glen Campbell fan, even saw him in Las Vegas many, many years ago, and this documentary was very difficult for me to watch. They didn't sugar-coat anything.  His drugs made his libido out of control, he couldn't find the bathroom and would urinate elsewhere in the house.  He was such a strapping fella, funny, active and had a quick wit.....and it all slowly slipped away.  Alzheimer's is a cruel disease, to the sufferer and their family, but Glen's wife and kids have stuck by him, support him and help wherever they can.  As of this writing, 6/18/16, he's in the final stages of the disease.  His suffering will be over soon and will rest in the arms of Jesus.  This documentary is very sad and continues to weigh heavy on my mind.  This is a must watch for any family also going through this with a loved one.

7270086,5,B00Z0GES3E,"A fantastic movie.
This film shows Glen Cambell and his family an his final tour as they face Glen having Alzheimer's. Think it gives a honest view of the disease and shows the strength and support of family and friends. As challenging as the circumstances are they came together in a positive way.
I had seen Glen Cambell at the Hollywood Bowl some years age, which was really fun. The thing that really has stuck with me about him is how nice and warm he seemed with his boys when I would run into them. I would always feel nice when I saw them. Not that he was a crlebrity, but because they seemed caring as a family. This is depicted in the film.
I have wanted to see this film since my father has Alzheimer's and my mother has brain damage, which is similar in many ways. I was apprehensive to see the movie as I thought it would be too much. Anyway, I just decided to do it and I'm glad I did as I really liked the film. Yes, I cried, but I also smiled.
The situation was so similar to my own in many ways, which I related to. Believe this may be helpful to others and provide greater understanding and compassion.

And he's up on stage singing with some family members & friends. Support like that is a gift and it is priceless. The only reason I
gave the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 was because of ""talking heads"" during the songs.  Example: When I watch Glen Campbell singing ""Witchita
Lineman"" I want to see him sing this song WITHOUT some guy INTERRUPTING & YAKING about Glen. Let him or her go yakity-yak-yak BEFORE the song or AFTER the song: NOT NOT NOT DURING THE SONG !!! This frustrates me no end.
Anyhow, I love Glen Campbell and I love the movie.... except for those song interruptions. And speaking of ""Wichita Lineman""
one of the best lyrics in a song is: ""And I need you more than want you; And I want you for all time...""
God bless you, Glen. Thanks for the music.",1459296000,3,893,4.347305389221557

7270104,5,B00Z0GES3E,"Glen Campbell was a huge star in my young adulthood - funny, self-deprecating, and a superb writer and performer.  Who can ever forget him galloping onto the stage on an imaginary horse in his eponymous TV show?

That was then.  The now is less kind.  After a long career, Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a few years ago.  This film is about his life today, as his memory betrays him, his family rallies to provide him care and security, and he embarks on his last tour.  While he can't remember what he had for breakfast, he remembers all his songs and performs them mostly flawlessly.

It's touching, funny, and very sad, as we look back to who he was and know what lies ahead for him.  Today, though, he's brave and funny, without a single self-pitying bone in his body, and the recipient of outpourings of love from his family and fans.

The film is beautifully made.  The camera lingers on the speakers - no whooshy camera work here.  Each person is given the time to say and do what they need to say and do - this is the opposite of the headache-inducing, fast-paced, strobe-like work we see too often.  Campbell and his wife and kids are completely at ease in front of the camera, speaking directly to it at times and completely ignoring its presence at others.

7270149,5,B00Z0GES3E,"I appreciated this film so much I had to write a review, I lead a very hectic life and rarely submit a review for anything, but I feel moved to do so in this case.  I watched my own Dad go through the stages of this disease, who incidentally was a big fan of Campbell's music.  I want to thank the Campbell family for allowing us to see those stages, in a dignified and poignant way, but not ""sugar coated"".  So much of the film was rich and affecting, both a wonderful tribute to Glen, and a stark statement that more needs to be done towards the research and care of this awful disease.  It was also a comfort to hear honest perspectives from Glen's wife, and children, that let me know that my own struggles and feelings as I watched Dad's dementia progress, seeing the painful personality and behavior changes, were shared by them as well.  As with I'm sure anyone who watches this film who has had their own ""Alzheimers"" story in life will agree, it almost perfectly shows what we all know;  that the person you knew, with all of their gifts and life contributions, starts to slip away, and there is little you can do but love them the very best that you can.  Glen certainly had the wonderful gift of super-talent, which his kid's now so obviously possess, and shared them with the world.  Thanks again to the Campbell family and for the producers for such a rich film experience that I will not soon forget.",1453507200,,1414,4.390804597701149

7270159,3,B00Z0GES3E,"I hate to be sole naysayer, but I found this movie very painful and difficult to watch.  I understand that the family and the makers of this film see it as a platform to gain understanding about this illness.  However, it was excruciating to watch scene after scene of this lovely man and his lovely family going through an intensely private and difficult struggle, over and over and over again, just to make that point.  I would have greatly loved to have just 20 or 30 minutes of this film be devoted to a celebration of Glen Campbell's life - old film clips, whatever - and not just a window into the devastation of his current illness.  I'm certain I will get some unpleasant comments here, but please know I didn't expect to be entertained or want to be entertained.  I'm a psychiatrist - I don't shy away from mental illness.  I understood what I would be watching - in principle.  But I also did not want to feel I was an intruder in the bedroom and bathroom of people who every day lose more and more of someone they love - even if they invited me there.  I am so sorry for this family, and I truly wish them well.  They seem like wonderful people.  I believe their intentions were full-hearted in making this film.  But I must be honest in saying it was just plain heart-wrenching and not otherwise (for me) very enlightening.  And I would still like to see someone make the ultimate Glen Campbell documentary.  He has had a stellar career.  Let's celebrate all of his life, not just this final and tragic episode.",1452297600,8,1523,4.431654676258993

I respect the courage of Glen and his family for doing the concert tour while he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  The firm clearly illustrates the agony of this disease.  The concert and back stage footage is interesting.

I attended 3 shows on his last tour including the concert at the Town Hall in New York City which is featured in the movie.  Glen performed well during each show but also he got a few lyrics wrong during each show.

I think that a concert film from this tour should be released because Glen did give some concerts.  During each show Glen performed several  songs from his great new album at the time ""Ghost On A Canvas.  ""Ghost On A Canvas"" is equal to his major albums from the 1960's and 1970's.",1447545600,5,866,4.493589743589744

It is indeed a tragedy that we must lose him in such a way.....the film is a MUST for anyone who has ever followed him thru his concerts.",1445904000,2,532,4.617021276595745
7270204,5,B00Z0GES3E,"What a completely consuming experience this highly emotional documentary drama showcasing Glen Campbell who is suffering from Alzheimers disease (AD) is to view - or more so - attend. His family of musicians (including friends) join him onstage for his 2011/2012  farewell tour. Glen himself wanted to do this along with his wife's, Kim, and his childrens backing. He successfully does one hundred and fifty-one shows to sell out venues. They make a stop at the Grammys to pick up his Lifetime Achievement Award, taking the stage filled with the so many talented fellow musicians joining in. An extremely rousing and perfectly done performance of ""Dueling Banjoes"" along with daughter Ashley is generously featured to the delight of any viewer. It is from sheer memory and instinct that the music flows without flaw and is quite amazingly done. You will also hear commenting from numerous respected musicians that join in the conversation about Glens remarkable musicality, pitch, and excellence including some of their personal experiences with the disease themselves. Along with Bruce Springsteen to Paul McCartney to The Edge, you will see and hear the respect beaming with enthusiasm from fans of every concert and the joy that returns to Glen as he takes the stage around the country.

Director James Keach adds important information from interviewing Glens Neurologist (with his consent) - Dr. Ronald Petersen M.D., as we see him go through different testing and changes to his memory with his wife by his side. All through this first period of the film, Glen is in great spirits as the doctor explains that for Glen his cognitive function in the area of music is the last part of him that he is losing. Going on tour is an astonishing way for Glen to thank his fans personally (while recording his final album) for the decades of love he has received from them and the thankfulness he has within his heart to offer back. He entertains audiences of packed houses that cannot get enough of him and are on their feet the moment he walks onstage. Talking with his family on tour while his daughter Ashley, who also joins her father in the band, speaks candidly about her feelings of how it will be when her father does not know her anymore completely broke my heart as this film is not altogether about his unmatched showmanship or performing, it is also so bittersweet, nostalgic, even humorous in places but equally gritty and human.

This is exactly what makes this a must see experience which is not totally about the music of Glen Campbell or solely for his adoring fans alone, but this rewardingly inspirational docudrama is truly a family's story that addresses this illness from all angles. It encompasses his lifetime through film clippings, past performances, candid interviews which  can be so heartfelt and painful at the same time. His past variety show, loving family members, respected musician's opinions of and on the legend are several ways to show the very full, important and poignant life of Glen Campbell. I certainly did not come away from this film unchanged but filled with emotion as this is done in such a fashion to not only be seen and heard - but felt - and felt so very deeply. There is nothing left on the surface here in this penetrating and all-encompassing life generously put in our care.

If you are compelled to view a candidly real and stripped raw story of one undaunted entertainer's life that has made a remarkable addition to our great history of American music - do yourself a favor and take in this wonderful piece of one man's exceptionalism while knowing that this film came straight from the generous heart of a loving and supportive family to yours.",1445904000,6,3701,4.858954041204437

It goes on to show Glen's decline and what it means to everyone around him.  It's heartbreaking stuff, the kind of thing you would never see in a big Hollywood movie.

So perhaps a little entertainment is sacrificed but its a very moving story.  And by the way, Glenn Campbell plays better guitar with Alzheimer's than most healthy people do.  I wish they showed more of that.",1445817600,3,550,4.45

Seeing Glen Campbell struggle and fail to recognize himself and his family on home movies is excruciating, and there are a lot of moments like that, but at the most unexpected times, flashes of the spirit and humor of this ageing performer surface.  He's still funny, capable of some truly sharp insights, and still tried to perform perfectly professionally until the bitter end.  Seeing the fans embrace him in his failing condition uncritically and lovingly, may make you feel kinder towards the public than you have in some time -- seriously, I wouldn't have expected that this sort of delightful acceptance was possible.  So many of us have had to become familiar with the terrible toll that Alzhemier's takes on families, and this picture certainly makes it clear that money, fame, and privilege provide no safeguards.

7270227,5,B00Z0GES3E,"This was a combination of touching tribute to Glen Campbell and a documentary of his failing memory due to Alzheimer's.  The final song is haunting in its honesty.  I struggled a bit with whether to give it 4 or 5 stars.  It does show his deterioration and the effect it had on his family and friends.  As a character study of a year in the life it is excellent.  Glen Campbell's celebrity, wealth, social network and medical care at Mayo Clinic showed the frustration and futility that is still experienced in fighting this disease. His willingness to go out and perform under less than ideal circumstances was impressive.  His family watching him and making a determination when enough was enough had to be agonizing.  I have respect for them all.

I watched this with my mother who suffers from the disease.  It gave me a better idea of what lies ahead.  I would have appreciated knowing if any of his treatments were helpful and, if so, for how long.  A little bit more about the disease and where to get information would have been helpful.

7270231,5,B00Z0GES3E,"There is absolutely no way to adequately describe the talent level of GC. To say he was merely a ""country"" artist completely ignores everything he is/was about. I am not a country music fan, but have the utmost respect for him as a total musician. Forget the superstardom...his legendary studio work is enough for me. An example, if you look at a list of the top 100 singles of all time, he either had the hit or played on 16 of them. Rent the movie ""The Wrecking Crew"" for background. He was such a great guitarist and vocalist I feel that, typical of the ""all about me"" 70's, we increasingly took him for granted. Thanks in large part to Jimmy Webb, his hits occupy an ethereal space in the music universe.

 I am not one of those grumpy ""they don't make em' like they used to"" types. I'm a rock fan and was only 6 years old when he recorded, in my opinion, the greatest written, sung and produced single of all time...""Wichita Lineman"". Go on YouTube and search WL and count the number of artists who've covered it.

 He was very candid in his book and in interviews that in the mid to late 70's/early 80's, he had severe problems. Alcohol, coke and the Tanya Tucker disaster, but if you go back and study his performances in that era he pulled off every show...perfectly. Just a supreme talent. As a quick aside, I remember seeing him quoted as saying the relationship with TT was so toxic, that they would get into terrible arguments...during sex.

 In regard to the documentary it's a heartbreaking, but necessary film. Because of his increasingly diminished mental capacity booking the farewell tour was risky. As you will see in the doc, there were moments on stage that completely fell apart. However, in the final analysis, most of the shows turned out to be a fitting curtain call. IBM richly deserves a 5 star rating.

 In the aftermath of the documentary there is one disturbing note. In the film Glen's current wife comes off as a loyal, loving companion. However, recent news articles revealed that she put GC in a home for Alzheimer's patients. The stories went on to say that she has forbidden visits from his older children (one can imagine why) which has resulted in legal action. The same story reported that she did not visit him regularly and he didn't even have a toothbrush, reading glasses or hearing aids. He reportedly didn't understand why he couldn't go home...extremely sad. She has gone on record as saying that those charges are false and that she has since checked him out of the facility and taken him back home. This move made following the bad publicity. I'm thinking to form an opinion will depend on your view. One might presume that this doc was a ""preemptive strike"" public relations piece prior to disposing of him. Others might contend that the move was justified citing the extreme challenges in dealing with a, sometimes violent, stage six Alzheimer's patient. She responded in an AP story stating that since bringing him home he is, at times, combative and gave her a black eye. Why it was necessary to reveal that seems self serving...if you know what I mean. I think all parties may have reached some sort of agreement. Not really sure.

The second scenario above is entirely plausible except for one thing. People with money can hire 24/7 on site care. Even if he had digressed beyond actually staying in the home, why not build a special facility on the premises allowing him to, at least, stay in familiar surroundings. In truth, the reality might be one side or the other (or both) only care about the money. The reason I mention all this is that a strong theme in the movie is God. The question I have is...what do you think God would have you do with him? A number of stories are online so you can form your own opinions. All of this continues to haunt me...

...and I need you more than want you...and I want you for all time...and the Wichita Lineman... is still on the line....

Love you Glen...Godspeed...

7270232,5,B00Z0GES3E,"My older relatives tell me that if you didn't grow up watching and listening to Glen Campbell, you can't begin to comprehend what a talented musician this man has been! A wonderful singer, sure, but a talented-beyond-talented guitar player!

We were very disappointed, though, to see/hear absolutely NO mention of the devastating tobacco drug, which CAUSES brain damage and mental illness, including Alzheimer's. Glen unfortunately became addicted to the tobacco drug early on and it has done its damage to him and so many other addicts AND to many innocent people who were/are exposed to the tobacco smoke of uncaring smokers. To adequately deal with ANY disease, you have to first address the CAUSE [...].

Still, this is a film which deserves an Academy Award. Glen's family and close friends deserve several awards for being there and helping him with his tragic disease. I know, since my own family has had several members diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",1444694400,3,955,5.115384615384615

7270234,5,B00Z0GES3E,This has been an emotional and moving experience. I was recently told that I had the Alzheimer gene. It gives one hope to know that certain parts of the brain remain somewhat functional as it was in Glen's case - music. My forte is poetry. To be able to grasp images which are somewhat fleeting can be quite traumatic. I watched as Glen Campbell tried to blame others (at times) for not playing the music properly or how scary it must have been when the teleprompter went dark! I urge people to watch this documentary just in case it is one of your loved ones who receives the sad news. I thank James Keach for his sensitivity in handling what could have been a debacle.

The second half of this movie is very heavy handed in showing Democrat politicians hard selling how the government needs to spend more money on this.  My problem with that is that all of them also believe that the government just needs to spend more money, period.  Obviously big business is spending big money, because if they find a cure they will make a fortune.

For the period of time that the movie took a turn in that direction, it took me out of what was otherwise a very emotionally touching and inspiring story.  I do recommend this film. And if you are a big government person, you might enjoy it even more than I did as it will speak to your convictions that government spending is the solutions to most of societies problems.

7270250,4,B00Z0GES3E,"This documentary follows Glenn Campbell on his last tour, as he deals with the effects of Alzheimer's. It's an absolutely fascinating documentary. In spite of the depressing subject matter, Campbell is funny and charming and he and his family are so likable that it's far more entertaining than you might expect. This is not to say it doesn't get awfully sad - you do see the disease progress and that can be hard to take - but overall it's a pretty positive movie even though it's dealing with something so grim.

There are a lot of interesting things in the film. I was fascinated by Campbell acting as though being unable to recall who the first president was his own decision - that he'd just tossed out extraneous information. It's amazing how well he was able to perform even as lost the ability to find his own bathroom. The family does a good job of dealing with Campbell; they're very nice (and strikingly attractive) and you feel really bad for them.

Unfortunately, some misguided choices keep this from being as good as it could have been. A big problem is a section in the middle in which a bunch of politicians blather on about how important a problem is, one of a number of times where the movie's advocacy goal played out in ham-handed tediousness. Even though the movie kills its own momentum in the middle though, it manages to get it back again.

There is also a monologue by the wife that is surprisingly defensive, since in the movie no one is criticizing her for taking Glenn on tour. I saw a premier with the filmmakers, the wife and daughter, and the wife said there were critics of the plan in the family, and I don't know why the movie didn't show that (or didn't get a less defensive monologue that wouldn't suggest there was more to the story than you'd seen).

Some things feel a little extraneous. There are brief chats with celebrities about how cool Glenn is that often seem pointless (although some, like Bruce Springsteen, did have something worthwhile to say). Glenn's security head also seems poorly integrated into the story. And there are clips of a young Campbell that in some cases work and in some don't.",1444262400,6,2145,4.607329842931938

7270269,3,B00Z0GES3E,"This movie was, unfortunately, very disturbing. Glen Campbell had an amazing career as a session musician, guitarist, singer, and entertainer, and frankly, it was amazing that he could play and sing as well as he did on his last tour given the condition he was in. His family shouldn't have put him through that last tour. I agree that his music helped slow his overall cognitive decline (which was the family's excuse for the tour), but they could have just let him sit at home in his studio with his guitars. I felt the last tour, this movie, and the song about Alzheimer's they had him record at the end with members of the Wrecking Crew were pretty much a last-ditch effort to cash in on the man's talents before it was too late. It was disrespectful to him at best.

BTW, I give the movie three stars because it was nice to see him play the guitar and sing. What a great talent.",1442620800,4,883,4.384146341463414

But I will say that it was at the same time uplifting to see the upbeat way Glenn Campbell carried himself most of the time through the early stages of this disease.  It was completely amazing how he could perform for so long.  Which truly speaks to why we all should be following our passion as that is what will get us through our most difficult times.  Do what you love.  Do it as much as you can for as long as you can.  In this film I got to know Glenn Campbell in a real and honest way.  His family is brave, talented, loyal, and full of love to have made the commitment to band together the way they all have.  Glenn evidently is truly a loving man to be cared for as he is by all of his children.  He evidently has given each of them  wonderful memories of him.

7270281,5,B00Z0GES3E,"As a long-time Glen Campbell fan, I had the pleasure of seeing this movie twice in the theater when it was first released in October 2014. Despite being one of the best films of the year, this touching, heartwarming documentary was only released to select cinemas across the country. Make no mistake, this is not a movie for only Glen Campbell/country music fans....it is a must-see film for any person with a heart and soul who enjoys a true heartfelt story of the human experience.

Directed by filmmaker James Keach, Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me documents Campbell's Alzheimer's diagnosis and his final goodbye concert tour of 2011/12. The movie provides an up close and personal glimpse of Campbell on stage and behind the scenes with his wife Kim and children Shannon, Cal, and Ashley who back him on stage as members of his touring band. As Campbell becomes the first performer to ever launch a concert tour while battling Alzheimer's disease, we watch the endless support of his family and fans who show him their love and encouragement as he struggles with the disease that is slowly robbing him of his memory and ability to perform effectively on stage.

Director James Keach does a nice job of capturing many funny and positive moments on camera that keep this from becoming the overly dark, depressing movie it could have easily been in the hands of another Hollywood director. Glen's down home country boy charm and humor shines throughout the film and the love and support shown by Kim Campbell as well as Glen's friends and fans turns the movie into a heartwarming experience despite the sad nature of the subject matter. For those who grew up seeing the confident, charismatic performer that Glen was in his prime, the second half of this movie will be hard to watch for many fans. You will see raw intimate moments of Glen struggling badly with his memory loss in private interactions with his family that add power and grit to the film. By the time his final concert performance comes around in late 2012, we watch Glen struggle to make it through a single song on stage.

The movie features many well-known and some surprising faces including Bruce Springsteen, Larry Gatlin, Jimmy Webb, Keith Urban, Paul McCartney, Jay Leno, Taylor Swift, and even President Clinton among many others who all pay their respects on camera to this true legend of American music. Glen's daughter Ashley {an up and coming musician in her own right} gave a tearful speech before congress about this disease and this footage is also featured in the movie. Also included in the film are two of the best new songs to appear on the music scene in the last year, Ashley Campbell's touching tribute to her dad ""Remembering"", and Glen's final studio recording, ""I'm not gonna miss you"" that won a grammy this year. We see historic footage of Glen recording the song in early 2013 with members of the legendary ""Wrecking Crew"" which included Campbell himself who played guitar on countless pop and country records in the 1960's, including Frank Sinatra's ""Strangers in the night"" and the Beach Boys classic Pet Sounds album.

Glen was sadly sent to live in a care home in April 2014 as his memory has now faded too severely to live independently. I had a real personal interest in this movie as my grandmother also suffered from Alzheimer's disease 20 years ago. I remember visiting her in New York when her memory was completely gone and she didn't know who we were anymore. Much attention has been given to Robin Williams' mental illness that resulted in his recent death. Glen's illness is yet another mental disease with no cure that affects many people every year. This documentary should serve to not only renew public interest in Alzheimer's disease, but will hopefully wake up the younger generation to a living legend of American music who, like too many others, deserves more media attention than he has gotten in the last 20 years. Thank you Glen for your golden legacy of talent and your major contribution to both American music and Alzheimer's awareness...

Do yourself a favor and add this DVD to your collection! Watch it with your family and be moved by the kind of uplifting, soul-enriching movie experience we need more of in today's world. In a modern era when too many contemporary Hollywood creations emphasize morbid guts and gore images that serve to disturb and offend more than educate and inspire, this is a refreshing movie of soul and substance that is well worth your time and money. Glen Campbell's memory and legacy will live on thanks to all who took part in the making of this very worthy film.",1441670400,74,4615,4.785445420326224

7270287,5,B00Z0GES3E,"A difficult movie to watch, but an important movie to see.

Saw the film on its theatrical release back in October 2014 and re-watched it on CNN in June 2015, obtained the DVD recently. Even after the 3rd viewing it remains poignant and moving, simply because the struggle is very real and Glen's talent and love for his family rises to offset even his darkest moments in this documentary.

The film is as much about family and love as it is a music legend. If offers insights to a rampant health crisis that was traditionally hidden away and kept hush-hush in families.

 It may not make dealing with your own personal struggle any easier, but will ease the burden of knowing you are not alone and that even through the tears, there is laughter and inner strength you didn't know would emerge.

7270301,5,B00Z0GES3E,"The Rhinestone Cowboy takes the road to understanding Alzheimers and we are invited along for the heartwarming (and heartbreaking ) ride on this DVD

Ive been a huge fan of Glen Campbell since he had his first hit with John Hartfords song Gentle on My Mind  and actually before then when he was playing guitar on those Phil Spector records (along with Leon Russel and Sonny Bono!)  and I was lucky enough to see Glan at the beginning of his Farewell Tour when he was diagnosed with Alzheimers disease. Even in those early days of the tour he would often forget some lyrics but, boy, when he played a guitar solo every note was right where it should be.

This 105-minute documentary which followed him on that nearly 2 year journey played a few film festivals and was important enough that CNN  the news channel  aired it one Saturday in June. I don't get cable so I had to wait for the DVD and it was well worth the wait. Not only is Campbell talented but he  and his whole family  are incredibly brave to head out on tour, letting the cameras roll, and showing the highlights as well as a few low lights. Glen is lucky he has three talented kids who act as his backup band. They were the opening act in the performance I saw in Philadelphia and could well have a career of their own (they do have an EP release).

This film has Campbell performing all his hits and there are lots of testimonials from well-known folks like Steve Martin, Bruce Springsteen and The Edge.

The DVD has a few bonuses like the music video for the title song (which won two Grammy awards) plus two short public service announcements for both the Alzheimers Foundation and the Ill Be Me Foundation, both worthy causes to find a cure for the illness (which affects 5.3 MILLION people this year alone.). Ill add a few more astounding facts below my signature but this is a review of the DVD.

If you ever were a Campbell fan youll want to see this film. Like the film Life Itself about Roger Ebert, the director had no idea where the story would take him when the project started, but it serves as both an entertaining as well as educational film in its final form.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

And now those facts
  Of the 5.3 million Americans with Alzheimer's, an estimated 5.1 million people are age 65 and older, and approximately 200,000 individuals are under age 65 (younger-onset Alzheimer's).

  Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women. Of the 5.1 million people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's in the United States, 3.2 million are women and 1.9 million are men.

  Although there are more non-Hispanic whites living with Alzheimer's and other dementias than people of any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, older African-Americans and Hispanics are more likely than older whites to have Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.",1441065600,2,2913,4.641325536062378
