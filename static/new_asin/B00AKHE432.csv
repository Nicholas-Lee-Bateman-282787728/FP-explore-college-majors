8553087,4,B00AKHE432,"THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART is really the story of Edinburgh's famous grave robbers Burke & Hare and was actually filmed as THE CRIMES OF BURKE AND HARE in 1948. However the British Censors of the time and Hare's descendants objected so the movie had to be dubbed over and the names were changed to Hart & Moore. The same thing happened with the 1953 Dylan Thomas screenplay THE DOCTOR & THE DEVILS where the names were changed to Fallon and Broom (it would be filmed in 1985 when the real names could have been used but weren't). No matter, everyone in the U.K. knew that it was Burke & Hare and with veteran Victorian style villain Tod Slaughter in the cast you knew who be playing Hare (Hart) as he had played the part on stage. If you've never seen a Tod Slaughter film before, then this is the ideal place to start.

It had a bigger budget than most of his films and Tod gives a more subdued, realistic performance until the very end when things turn against him and the classic, over the top Tod Slaughter emerges. Because of its more realistic nature and some atmospheric lighting and photography, this is my favorite Slaughter film (THE FACE AT THE WINDOW is a close second) although I love all his movies. However he is definitely not for everybody especially today's modern audiences. Compared to Slaughter, Vincent Price is positively restrained so that should tell you what to expect. In addition to the lighting and the photography, it's worth noting that the screenplay is by a young John Gilling who would later go on to direct THE FLESH & THE FIENDS (1959) which remains the best of the five versions of the Burke & Hare story so far. For the record the others are (The Horrors of) BURKE & HARE (1972 which is the weakest), the aforementioned THE DOCTOR & THE DEVILS (1985), and the recent BURKE & HARE (2010) with Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis.

While the names of Burke & Hare had to be changed for this movie, the names of their victims were not. Three of the sixteen they killed are featured here. There's Mary Patterson, James Wilson or ""Daft Jamie"", and the one that finally did them in, old Mrs Docherty. Henry Oscar as Burke (Moore) holds his own with the larger than life Slaughter as does Aubrey Woods as ""Daft Jaime"". The other cast members manage to fulfill what is required of them which was often the case in Slaughter's films. I rank this version a close third behind THE FLESH & THE FIENDS and THE DOCTOR & THE DEVILS. The John Landis/Pegg/Serkis version places fourth. A WORD OF WARNING! Beware the DVD version known as HORROR MANIACS. Although it has a better cover, the source is an inferior 16MM print and is almost 30 minutes shorter than the original release. Also take note that this version is Region 2 and not playable on regular players.",1411689600,2,2774,4.5239043824701195
