8415592,5,B0037MIDP2,"This gives you a number of pro looking special effects using particles, plus after completing all the projects you have a much greater understanding of how to use ""particular"" for after effects. I bought this for the lightning tutorial, and was impressed with the other effects tutorials. The best way to learn is by doing something practical, like creating fire, lightning, or a star trek transporter beaming up effect. The effects were also surprisingly straight forward, you weren't left with...you do what? So long as you own ""Particular"" for after effects, you won't get lost in the tutorial by being a novice. He goes step by step and slow, but not so slow you want to commit suicide. I'm pretty adept in AE, and I still liked the pacing of instruction.

I watched this guys other tutorials on Creative Cow website, and so I had no problem forking up some cash for some of his higher end effects. I would highly recommend this DVD.",1369267200,,937,4.713414634146342
