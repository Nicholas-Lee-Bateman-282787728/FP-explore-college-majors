8749880,4,B01BDH30T6,"When this show came out, I had caught the tail end of the 1st Season and didn't know that the show had continued. A few years ago, I came across the DVD set and watched all three Seasons. Season 1 and 2 were definitely my favorites. I had watched the DVDs SO much that they wouldn't work anymore. I bought this Blu Ray and am VERY happy. The picture and sound are vivid. Unfortunately, the extras that were included with the DVD are not to be found on the Blu-Ray. This is unfortunate because the DVD included bloopers and cut scenes. It also included the history/science behind the mutants and their powers.

As for the show, the actors, and their characters, had a chemistry that couldn't be beat. However, Season 3 was a little disappointing. It appears that the writers were attempting to insert a new character that would be able to ""hit the ground running."" Unfortunately, she comes across as arrogant, obnoxious and petulant. And by Season 3, Episode 5, I just wanted the character to die.

With all of that being said, I love the show and am sad that it ended.",1522713600,6,1068,4.5
