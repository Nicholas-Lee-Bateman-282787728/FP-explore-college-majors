There are now 3 fine and equally recommendable recordings available on Blu-ray of the Dvorak Symphony 9 available for consideration and this is one of them. The three options provide for alternative couplings as well as other considerations as regards price and especially, playing time.

These recordings, made in 2014, were made in the Herkulessaal der Muchner Residenz, Munich as distinct from the recordings made the following year in a different Munich venue by the same musicians.  That one features Don Quixote by Strauss and the Symphony 8 by Dvorak. This particular disc has the benefit of a brighter and more revealing sound where the brass and percussion are more clearly projected. This seems to be more to do with the more revealing acoustics of this hall rather than any direction from Jansons. The camera work is involving without being invasive, the imaging is of good HD standard and the sound is well presented in DTS Master Audio 5.0 and stereo. The lack of a separate sub-woofer channel is not a problem in this case.

The two pieces benefit considerably from the clarity of the sound and match Jansons essentially straightforward direction. The two pieces seem to have been recorded on separate occasions.  This is partly deduced from noting different players in the brass and woodwind sections, but rather more crucially by noting the changed hairstyles of a few of the lady players. It seems highly unlikely that anyone would change their hairstyle from ponytail to free style during an interval! Other than that observation the two recordings deliver identical characteristics.

The Dvorak is an exciting performance with generally forward pulse unaffected by undue deviations for additional expression. In this respect it joins the alternative recordings by Abbado with the BPO in Italy in 2002 and Dausgard in Denmark from 2009. Both Abbado and Dausgaard are marginally even more straight in their interpretations with Abbado being the most straightforward of the three. However, these are very small differences and not likely to be considered essential by most collectors.

This new disc offers collectors the only modern version of the Mussorgsky Pictures so far available and this is an excellent performance with performances of distinction from all the soloists featured by Ravels arrangement. Once more, there is a good forward pulse where appropriate and there are plenty of satisfying ensemble sections to appreciate too. In particular it is worth mentioning the percussion contribution at the start of the Catacombs where the combined texture is particularly effective although not featured on camera. Overall, this is a performance that is likely to be a leading contender as alternative options may appear over time.

This then is a fine and collectable disc. So are the alternatives though and the variety of couplings make all three highly desirable. Collectors would overlap with the Dvorak in each case but all three choices may arguably be worth the duplication of such a major and collectable work.

Dausgaard clearly offers the most running time at slightly higher cost and his disc offers fine performances and recordings of no less than four main symphonies  Brahms 1, Dvorak 9, Sibelius 5 and Nielsen 3. Abbado is on particularly fine form and his disc, arguably one of his very best collections, offers superb and exciting overtures by Beethoven and Verdi, an outstanding Brahms Violin concerto with Shaham and a particularly exciting Dvorak. Jansons offers the shortest running time at a similar cost as Abbado. These issues may pose additional and relevant considerations for individual collectors.

Collectors with deep pockets should consider Abbado, Dausgaard AND Jansons as all three deliver fine performances and recordings with Dvorak duplicated. Other collectors can choose safely based simply on three programme choices with all offering fine performances and recordings.",1482105600,,3959,5.288216560509555
