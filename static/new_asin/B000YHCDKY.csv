8232783,3,B000YHCDKY,"I would simply like to echo the 3-star review provided by Aaron Baker Cole.  ""The Resurrection"" certainly deserves remastering, but I suppose some gratitude is due to the person/party who took the trouble to transfer a minimally adequate print and make it available to the dvd-buying public.",1340928000,,291,5.191489361702128
8232784,3,B000YHCDKY,"I was so pleased to find the Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler on disk. It's a great story and well performed by all. I would have given the product a better rating, but it deserved remastering and never received it. This old project rendition suffers as a result. While the companion stories haven't received rave reviews, I found them insightful and charming, much in the mold of Twilight Zone projects.",1323820800,,403,4.855072463768116
8232785,5,B000YHCDKY,"I had seen this film as a kid and always wanted to see it again. It foresees the cloning of individuals for body parts and is so much better than the ridiculous rip-off high-budget film ""The Island"". Also stars Leslie Nielsen, so what's not to like. Comes with some ""Tales Of The Unexpected"" nonsense that can be ignored.",1264896000,3,321,4.551724137931035
