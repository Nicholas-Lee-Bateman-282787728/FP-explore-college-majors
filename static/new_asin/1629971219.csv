201866,5,1629971219,"I can't say enough about these Great Course programs. This set is basically an MBA in a box, and is useful for anyone who is taking MBA classes, or who may be planning to start (or already has) a small business. It starts right at the beginning and goes through sophisticated topics that you might not even encounter in a live MBA program.  There are 5 different renowned professors, and each one presents 12 different lectures. While the price for the program may seem daunting, the education that it compares to, in a brick and mortar university, is at least 10 to 20 times the cost! If you are interested in learning all about business, and you want a genuine college presentation and don't care about actually getting the degree (just the knowledge) this is the program for you! I did receive this item at a discount for my unbiased review. Please understand that this system helps YOU - I test it out and tell you the truth - good or bad.  Please click yes if my review was helpful!",1465948800,,987,4.477777777777778

I love all of the Great Courses, and I can honestly say this is the best one I've gone through so far.  These are skills that everyone should use, or at least know.  Fantastic manner in which to deliver information that is sometimes heavy and dense.  Very enjoyable.  I like this very much.",1464739200,,387,4.380281690140845
201868,5,1629971219,"I listened to the audio version of this title from The Great Courses, and it's an epic series taught by five world class professors. I will be recommending this series to every manager in my organization, whether they already have an MBA or not.

While the sections on accounting and finance clearly would have benefited from the video version, I was overall enthralled and amazed by these wonderful professors and this incredibly ambitious series. It is essentially the entire core 1st year MBA curriculum, spanning 60 lectures, with 5 professors taking on the core requirements of the typical MBA curriculum: Management strategy, Operations Management, Accounting, Finance, Organization Behavior, and Marketing.

I have an MBA from a top business school, but its been a while since Ive been in the classroom, and any good business manager knows that you can never stop learning and reviewing the fundamentals. So my perspective listening to this series was that most of the concepts were not new, but all of it was valuable, and every section offered helpful new frameworks for me to use in thinking about my organization, my management style, and the business issues we all face in the 21st century.

It should not come as a surprise that the sections on management strategy, organizational behavior, and marketing were the most entertaining (and most suited for audio), while the sections on accounting and operations had their dry moments. From my perspective, this is the nature of the beast and not a reflection on the professors.

The Great Courses is known for finding the world's greatest professors, and this series is no exception. More on each:

Management Strategy is taught by Professor Michael Roberto, who has taught at NYU, Harvard, and Bryant. If you have watched or listened to The Great Courses titles on Transformational Leadership or Critical Decision Making (both excellent), then you already know how great Professor Roberto is. Youll be happy to know that his lectures n this series are not redundant at all with those titles. You also will not be surprised to know they are highly organized and entertaining at the same time. He offers a fresh framework for thinking about business strategy that should be relevant to anybody from entrepreneurs to middle managers to Fortune 500 executives. Every one of Professor Robertos lectures offers the winning formula of a logical framework for the principles at hand plus real world stories that you can repeat to help remember and spread the wisdom in your organization. The lecture on The Danger of Straddling may be my favorite.

Operations Management is taught by Professor Thomas Goldsby from Ohio State. Goldsby spends a lot of time at the beginning of this section defining operations and describing the critical role it plays in business success. He does a great job, and for the inexperienced manager, this is critical. For me, this part was a little too much review; but once we got into the details of things like inventory management, business process reengineering, and performance measurement, I was hooked and learned a lot about how operations managers approach these topics, and some of the common pitfalls encountered. Most of what I remember from my Operations classes is learning linear programming models. This series, for what its worth, offers a higher-level strategic view of operations management. There is math in some lectures, mainly about the types of metrics one would use to measure operational effectiveness.

The subjects of Accounting and Finance are taught in tandem by Professor Eric Sussman from UCLA. No doubt this is the one section where you might wish you'd spent your money on the video version. All of the examples used are actual financial reports from companies like Apple, Intel, and Walmart. Accounting and Finance are of course important both for the business manager and the personal investor. Professor Sussman provides both perspectives, making this section different from the rest of the course. For my purposes, there was a little too much emphasis on the investor point of view, though all of it was relevant. To be clear, if youve never seen an income statement or balance sheet or cash flow statement, and you choose the audio version, you would definitely want to have examples of these financial statements in front of you.

Organizational Behavior is taught by Professor Clinton Longenecker at the University of Toledo. Wow. What a find he is. Im not surprised that he has won over 40 teaching awards. The field of organizational behavior can be tackled from a variety of angles. For these 12 lectures, Professor Longenecker switches the tone of the course towards a very direct advice mode, much in the same vein as the outstanding Great Courses titles The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal and Art of Conflict Management. If you haven't enjoyed those series, trust me; this is high praise. Any one of these 12 lectures is worth the price of admission, whether you are just entering the workforce or leading a staff of hundreds or thousands. It is a switch in tone from the rest of the series, and honestly not what I expected, but as somebody who has both studied organization behavior and worked in a variety of management roles, I found the content to be outstanding, and words to live by.

Marketing is taught by another brilliant find  Professor Ryan Hamilton, a Northwestern/Kellogg School PhD now teaching at Emory University. This is a field I know well, so I was prepared to be critical, but Professor Hamilton knocked it out of the park with this highly-organized and entertaining set of lectures on the fundamentals of marketing. He presents a highly thoughtful, highly organized framework that should be taught in every business school. While most introductory marketing courses start with the Four Ps framework (product, price, promotion, and place), Professor Hamilton starts instead with marketing strategy  how to segment a market, target a segment, position your offering, and create value for your chosen segment. This section addresses many misconceptions about what marketing is, and is an outstanding bookend to Professor Robertos strategy lectures that opened the course. Professor Hamilton then turns to tactics, pointing out that the four Ps  and even branding itself  are simply tactics. There is much to learn about these tactics, but they are meaningless in the absence of a strategy based on segmentation, targeting, and positioning. Like Professor Roberto earlier, Professor Hamilton peppers his lectures with real world case studies and cautionary tales that help make things entertaining and memorable.

All in, an epic series that I will recommend to others and certainly return to in years to come.",1464393600,2,6759,5.1105072463768115

I slogged through all 60 lectures, thinking that I would learn at least one new thing---but no such luck.  The lectures are almost entirely words--blah blah--words--blah blah, with almost no equations (except for a few on present value and the fundamental accounting eq.).  I'm a member of The Institute for Operations Research and Management Science and The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  For the past 80 years, there has been a tremendous amount of work in Operations Research and Management Science--but these lectures are utterly devoid of any of this new knowledge.  I'll tell you what businesses really need:  sophisticated software for accounting, finance, economics, engineering, and operations research; for example, see my commercial software packages Optimal Manager, Optimal Engineer, and Optimal Scientist--these make it easy to optimize business decision-making.  Again, I'm astonished beyond belief how old-school these business lectures are.  Don't waste your time or money.",1519516800,,1164,5.8

7800686,5,1629971219,"This set is an excellent overview of the core topics you get at business school. The professors are uniformly excellent, and I can't think of how one could distill the topics of Strategy, Operations, Finance & Accounting, Organizational Behavior, and Marketing into a set of 12-lecture/6-hour segments any better.

While one shouldn't choose their favorite (much like children), I would have to say the one that impressed me the most was the final one (on Marketing). Having gone through B-School myself (a Finance major), the subject that appealed least to me in school was Marketing. Yet somehow, Prof. Hamilton made it very accessible and entertaining at the same time.

I highly recommend this set of lectures if one is interested in what's taught at business school. You can't ask for a better introduction. Go for it.",1477008000,,823,5.044117647058823
