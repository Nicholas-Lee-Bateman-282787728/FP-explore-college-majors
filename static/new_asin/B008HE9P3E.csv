5165002,5,B008HE9P3E,"After watching a FOX news about this being the last season...(5 total).
FOX said they will have an ending to this show. The first time FOX Network will be making a conclusion to one of it's shows.
Very well done. I'm not much on watching TV shows, but so glad I have stuck with this show and now hearing FOX will make a final at the end of the 5th run.
THANK YOU FOX!!!
So now I can plan on getting all 5 seasons on DVD.
A beginning and an end, instead of a show going off the air and never seeing it again.

GREAT SHOW!!!!",1349568000,,523,3.9339622641509435
5165003,5,B008HE9P3E,"(Review of 5.02)
When we last left the Resistance, they were experiencing the first burgeonings of hope - here we learn just how hard those hopes will be dashed, and how mightily they can rise again.
Fringe hits its stride again, calling up questions of hope and hopelessness, and whether the bonds of family can transcend the good and the desperate. While the pacing seems to trip up in places, ""In Absentia"" provides  several emotional thrills with a tiny dose of heartbreak - but that's Fringe for you. Dialogue does the heavy lifting plotwise, but the heart of this show has always been in the quiet moments, the subtle looks, and the powerful cast chemistry, and this episode is no exception.
With only a few episodes to go, Fringe promises excitement around every turn, and I am thrilled to be along for the ride.",1349481600,45,819,4.6875
5165004,5,B008HE9P3E,"With only a half season to wrap things up, the pressure is on for Fringe as it tells its final story. Gone are the filler episodes of yore (here's to you, Molebaby) as mythology takes charge.
Etta (Georgina Haig) fits right in with everyone's favorite team of misfit heroes. The burgeoning family dynamic is nice to see and will certainly be interesting to watch grow.
The episode itself was well-paced and engaging, keeping me right along as it moved from plot point to plot point. Some of our regulars were conspicuously missing, but they were in the promo photos so I'm sure they'll reappear. Complimenting the acting at this point is just silly, as once Anna Torv shed all accusations of ""woodeness"" in season one, there have been nothing but accolades for the entire cast.
All said, a very worthy beginning of the end. I look forward to so much more.",1349395200,2,855,4.66887417218543
5165005,5,B008HE9P3E,"2036, resistance is futile.... The first episode of of season 5 is proof positive of why this is one of the best shows in the last 10 years. I watch about 4 shows regularly but none have me on the edge of my seat like this one. Fringe never gets stale or boring always fresh, interesting, and especially those tripped out 19th episodes of each season. I hope the series does good enough to get a 6th season or maybe a alternate universe spin off.",1348963200,4,446,4.258823529411765
5165006,5,B008HE9P3E,"I am so glad that Fringe gets 13 more episodes. If the rest of the season is as good as this premiere, it's going to be the best of the series. Going out on a high note is what this wonderful show deserves.

Everyone gave killer performances, but especially John Noble. The end has a beautiful message. Hope can be found in the smallest of cracks.",1348876800,3,347,4.257575757575758

5165008,5,B008HE9P3E,"The Fringe team is back in all their glory, albeit somewhat broken and in need of hope. Great start to the final season. It is more like watching  part of a feature film than a tv episode. Highly recommended.

5165014,3,B008HE9P3E,"The first three of the series were really good, but it lost its way in 4 & 5.  Walter became nasty and Olivia became a boring negative Nellie always gloomy, uninspired.  What ruined the show was the HORRIBLE LOUD music that drowned out the dialog in many places.  It was overly dramatic music that played during every entire episode.  Sometimes it was piercingly shrill and totally unnecessary up and down the scales - awful.  We had watched the first four and wanted to know how it ended, so we struggled through Season 5, part of the time with the sound off and closed caption turned on.",1511395200,,589,4.518867924528302

Dear Jeff,

please put some money in your hands - you don`t need all the Billions to buy fuel for your spaceship - and hire J.J. Abrams to reunite the Fringe team.

I don`t care about the story line, just bring back the team!

Ok, in case you need some suggestions:

- The team travels into future to find Walter
- The lost episodes - What happened to Walter that he decides to cut out several parts of his brain
- Walter comes back; Bell, Observers, Doubles breathing down his neck and Walter finally creates his own universe where he and everybody else from every universe can live together in peace
(maybe a hidden episode where Anna Torv has to investigate undercover in the Playboy Mansion)

Thank you very much in advance!",1506297600,,764,4.706766917293233

The acting was mostly poor. No chemistry between Olivia and Peter, and Olivia's character and her constant troubled countenance were irritating, even given her history. King of overacting was the Walter character who was prissy and ugly in his mannerisms. The only remotely interesting and well acted characters were Astrid, the assistant and the ""watcher"" called September.",1479168000,,464,5.27027027027027

5165086,4,B008HE9P3E,"I can't bring myself to give anything associated with Fringe less than a 4-star rating. If I could, Season 5 would get a 3-star rating.  It's like the first 4 seasons was a 26.2-mile marathon and the writers, the directors, the producers, the actors, even the audience just barely limped past the finish line having given every ounce of energy they possibly had to give just to reach the end.  And then the race director suddenly jumped up and shouted that the marathon was being extended by another 5 miles, and demanded that everybody get back out on the track.  I'm sorry, I can see that people gave whatever tiny amounts of energy they had left as they struggled forward after that point, but the only way they were going to match the previous 4 seasons' marathon pace was if they caught some kind of rest for at least a year or so.

The plot for season 5 was so stupid that I am convinced that this was the one season that, exhausted, the other writers finally paid attention to that one crazy writer in their midst who they had ignored and over-ruled for the previous 4 seasons.  You know the writer I am talking about, the weird guy in the group whose ideas were just too crazy and far out there even for Fringe.  With Season 5, that heretofore shunned writer was listened to, and his ideas were actually carried forward and implemented, leading to the invasion of the Observers.

Now when you are invaded by bald telepathic people who can step through both time and space at their will, there is only one way they can be stopped.  And of course that way is by having Walter lead a scavenger hunt for various objects and people over a span of 13 episodes, while various people around him risk their lives on a regular and frequent basis, usually to little or no purpose but to inject drama.

Season 5 is, in another way, a victory lap, so you expect a few dragged-out sentimental goodbye moments.  The only problem is that a lot of the dragged-out goodbye moments involved people who weren't really the main characters (Astrid, Olivia, Walter, Peter).  Instead you tended to get more sentimental goodbye moments between September and the feral Observer boy than anything else.

I read someone's critique that the Olivia role was castrated (so to speak) in Season 5 and became too passive. I didn't get that --  the Olivia character has always been one who steps up when needed and steps back when not needed, and that is exactly what she does in season 5.  For season 5, there seems to be established some kind of a blossomed consciousness that Olivia is closer in stature to the Virgin Mary Mother of God than to any human woman.  And for the audience that feeling of reverence is kind of backed-up and enforced by Olivia Dunham's actions over the previous 4 seasons.  And meta to the show, Torv has similarly used the Olivia role to anchor and secure the show as a great one.  But it gets a little bit cheesy when the other characters start treating Olivia with the same kind of ""Can-I-have-your-autograph"" reverence that we as an audience can easily feel when we see her.  Olivia Dunham is not a character who would ever be comfortable as an autograph-signer.

Having ranted through 90% of my space, this is, after all, the Fringe that rocked us time after time over the course of around 100 episodes, made us love (and revere) Olivia, appreciate Peter, and laugh and marvel at Walter, and respect Astrid.  So if Season 5 goes from the 70% inspiration to 30% perspiration ratio to 30% inspiration/70% perspiration, who is going to complain too much?  Really, we are somewhat satisfied that we at least don't have to say our sad goodbyes to these characters just yet. So, should you you watch Season 5?  Hell yes!

If nothing else, you will give yourself an opportunity to get a little bit more tired yourself, and wean yourself away from this series a little more gradually and a little less painfully...",1474934400,,3914,4.591954022988506
