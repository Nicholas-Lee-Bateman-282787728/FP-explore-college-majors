4657803,1,B005DCJ2RW,"This movie is about what not to do when making a movie.  The plot is mindless.  The acting is phoned in, but that might be due in part to the script, which was written by a third-grader.  By 30 minutes in, I found myself not caring what happened to Mira Sorvino.

4657806,5,B005DCJ2RW,"In a genre that's typically unintelligent and forced, 'The Presence' is refreshingly minimal, precise and Hitchcock-ian, and keeps you relatively on edge trying to figure out what's going on.

4657807,1,B005DCJ2RW,"Give them credit for making something different from the homogenized horror/suspense films that are the norm these days, and I respect the artistic effort, but this was not good.

There weren't any real scares.
The pacing was slow(which I'm ok with but not the way it was done here as it never really draws you in. Had the feel of a 70's horror film. And some of those are tough to watch).
The scant dialogue was poor/not believable.
The story was silly(being nice).
The characters weren't well-rounded or developed in a way that made them feel real.
The interaction between the characters was flat.
*Spoiler*
What was with the tacit homoeroticism between the ghosts? Did the one ghost have a crush on the other?
The ending with the good ghost(I guess?) helping to save the day seemed extraneous and I wasn't really into it.

Again, they went for something different. It was bold. It just didn't work for me. But I respect anyone putting his or herself out there in the arts. Takes guts. Some of these work, some of them don't, but I hope the filmmakers keep putting stuff out there.",1391990400,,1083,4.635416666666667
4657808,1,B005DCJ2RW,"If you've ever seen a ghost story before, you won't know whether to be bored or disappointed. The only winner here his the score, and that manages to lose because it seems built for a very different film. In a more traditional ghost/horror story, it would have been perfect.
It is all downhill from there. At least half the film is spent with characters standing around, attempting to build mood but in practice only seeming pretentious. The acting is a poor effort from all involved, most notably the incredibly out of his depth Shane West. The few times the plot ventures into something happening, it is either completely predictable of insanely illogical(biggest problem- Sorvino's reason for going to the cabin in light of revelations about her past).
In all, the most interesting way to spend ones time with this is to count missed opportunities- points that might have actually built the story up and are instead ignored.",1387584000,,927,4.910828025477707
4657809,5,B005DCJ2RW,I love this film. It is the kind of film which works like HP Lovecraft's stories. The tension is built up by atmosphere and it is character-driven. Mira Sorvino is wonderful and I (although I realise not everyone shares this view) for one love the ending. It says so much about what it is to be human and how life is made up half the time of us fighting our own demons. Great movie.,1387411200,3,382,4.175675675675675

4657811,5,B005DCJ2RW,"NOT like the movie trailer. If you like thoughtful and slow-paced movies, this is for you. It's definitely worth seeing--all of the actors, especially Tony Curran, are stellar.

4657812,1,B005DCJ2RW,"I cannot believe the high marks for this piece of crap.  I love movies of all kinds and I LOVE ghost stories, but this ... thing ... is just so dumb in every possible way.  It's dull, corny, and silly.  When there is dialogue, it's so bad you wish they would go back to not talking.  Make-up is awful and goofy.  There is nothing worse than when somebody is trying to make something appear to be ""deep"" when it's barely even a puddle.",1381622400,2,434,4.180722891566265
4657813,3,B005DCJ2RW,This is a spooky little horror film that will not make you jump out of your chair but does have good acting & is worth watching. Sorvino is a good actress.,1378857600,2,155,4.032258064516129
4657814,4,B005DCJ2RW,"It's a curious thing at first, the fact that writer/director Tom Provost's directorial debut (his second filmed screenplay) starts with over 15 minutes of silence before anyone says a word.  But looking back, that silence sets the tone of the movie and establishes the situation, informing the character of ""the woman"", played by Mira Sorvino.

The woman has come to her grandparents' cabin on a remote island to work.  I'm not sure what her work is, but she spends a lot of time, it looks like, copying things out of a book.  She spends her days and nights alone, in silence, coming here for the peace and quiet.  There's no electricity on the island, her bathroom is an outhouse.  The cabin is very nice, and incredibly cozy.  I would love to spend a week there.  It rains a lot, and it's chilly enough overall that she can keep a few fresh chickens in the shed out back and they'll be just fine.  She seems to have a pretty sweet setup going on.

There is, however, the ghost that stands silently by and watches everything she does.  Shane West gives just about the most wooden performance he's ever given in his life, but this time I think it's on purpose, as his character never utters a word, rarely shows an emotional connection, but he does a boat load of acting with his eyes, and while I think he overplayed it a few times, for the most part, I liked his character.

Then the woman's boyfriend, the man (no, they don't have names), shows up.  They're obviously in love but you can tell immediately she doesn't welcome the company.  She doesn't tell him to leave, and puts on a show of being happy he's there, but it's pretty obvious she came here for a reason, and company wasn't it.  She makes the best of it, though, getting some work done while he explores the island, taking hikes with him, showing him all of her favorite places to go when she was here as a child.  He proposes to her and she says yes, but almost immediately afterward her attitude changes.

He asks her to show him how to light the stove and he'll cook for her, but she tells him if you're going to be here you need to learn to take care of yourself.

She apologizes later for the outburst, but it happens again the next day after he's made dinner.  She doesn't want dinner, she wants to keep working, she never even asked him to come here in the first place.

The man is taken aback and considers leaving the island, going back home and letting her do her thing.  Even the ghost is confused.  Until he sees the man in black kneeling beside her, whispering words of discouragement in her ear.

THE PRESENCE is a different kind of ghost story.  The ghost in this case isn't the antagonist, but rather serves as the viewer's gateway to seeing what's really going on.  The man in black, however, isn't a ghost, he seems to be something much more sinister, and he takes a great deal of pleasure in turning the woman against the man.

Sorvino gives a solid performance as a woman with a tortured past, memories she doesn't want and is obviously constantly battling them and trying to be happy in the present.  Justin Kirk (""Weeds"") as the man plays his character like someone who is genuinely invigorated by his proximity to the woman he loves.  His life is going great and there's nothing that would please him more than to be able to share such joy with this woman who contributes so much to that happiness.

Provost, as writer and director, is telling the story he wants to tell, and he made some very interesting choices in telling it.  I like the story, even if I don't fully understand it.  The ending was the weakest part with a terribly placed deux ex machina, but I think the story had written itself into a corner and at that point it was really six of one, half dozen of the other and ANY ending was probably going to be weak compared to the rest of the movie.

For me, I'm most interested in these small set pieces, one or two locations, minimal characters, and a straightforward story that slowly, and very intelligently, reveals itself to have layer upon layer.  THE PRESENCE isn't played for scares, but for an overall uneasiness in the viewer.  Provost doesn't want to make us jump in our seats or make us have to turn on all the lights on the way to the bathroom; instead he wants us to question the very air next to us.  THE PRESENCE doesn't frighten, it creeps.  Not many movies can do that and I applaud it.  I think that terrible climax could have been fixed with but a few altered lines of dialogue from the man in black earlier in the movie, but overall I enjoyed this movie and found myself engaged and engrossed due to the tone and atmosphere Provost established, and was able to maintain throughout.  Good job.",1373673600,7,4714,4.438372093023256
4657815,1,B005DCJ2RW,Totally and completely a waste of my time.  I'm not kidding when I say I laughed from beginning to end. Everything was laughable. It felt like I was watching an after school special. It amazes me that this woman actually won an academy award and now produces and stars in such crap! I expect more....,1373155200,,300,4.454545454545454
4657816,5,B005DCJ2RW,Great service and product was as advertised.  Even though used dvd played as if it were new one.  Could not have been more pleased.,1373068800,,131,4.416666666666667
4657817,2,B005DCJ2RW,"The Presence is such a weird movie.  It's not scary, suspenseful or interesting so it's kind of ruined.  For the first half you see a woman exploring her wild outdoor surroundings which presents a beautiful and realistic scenery.  However odd things occasionally happen.  For example while the woman is using the bathroom a rock is thrown directly at the outhouse.  A ghost probably did it... or a squirrel.  No it had to be a ghost (since squirrels can't throw objects like a baseball).

She spends her days and nights listening to the same jazz music on her record player over and over while being nice and comfortable in her log cabin, all the while a pale-faced man roams through the house that we see from time to time.  Soon, after a visit from her neighbors courtesy of a boat ride across a beautiful lake out front, her boyfried arrives.  Make that her clueless boyfriend.  He can't even light a stove by himself.  Wow, what would happen if he ever had to survive on his own?  Those woods would own him.  At least he can propose right... oh wait, no he can't.  Something goes wrong there too.  Things go bump in the night when he has to take a number two and ventures out to use the outhouse, making this the first movie ever to focus on outhouse horrors... but no, unfortunately that's the end of the outhouse misadventures.  Darn, so much potential too.

Anyway, about halfway through we find out the pale-faced man is a shy ghost that likes to concentrate really hard.  Soon, the presence of an angry ghost appears and influences the shy ghost to do bad things because doing so would give the shy ghost amazing powers.  Nothing better than feeling unstoppable.  Throughout the movie the shy ghost basically stands by as the mean ghost takes over the log cabin.  He's apparently taking over the way people feel too.  Hey, I bet it was the mean ghost who threw that rock at the outhouse earlier.  It couldn't have been the nice one.

However it's never really stated why the woman occasionally lashes out at her husband so we're left to assume the mean ghost is responsible for this.  Eventually it spoils over into the woman being a complete emotional mess due to a tragic event involving her father not being a very good man when the woman was just a kid (apparently her dad abused her, maybe even worse things) and as a result her mind is completely messed up and assumes this boyfriend of hers is a no good scumbag.  Well he may be a really clueless guy but his heart is certainly in the right place- he seems very loyal and a perfect match, and his defense is logical and clear.  It's a shame she's so eager to throw it all away due to bad childhood memories coming back to haunt her.

Anyway, eventually it's all about two ghosts battling over each others powers.  Bad choice of direction.  It's really not a very compelling movie to me.  Maybe to you or anyone looking for a different supernatural approach to the storytelling would appreciate this, but I prefer a more sensible approach to writing which this movie lacks.  For 85 minutes, it sure feels more like 125.  Two or three ghostly-related scares occur, and that's it.",1372809600,,3143,4.555357142857143
4657818,4,B005DCJ2RW,"Those who enjoy being lead through stories won't like this film, but those that enjoy thinking through a film and trying to figure out the meaning and ending will enjoy this.  I don't want to say much to give the ending away, but if you enjoy horror that isn't ""in your face"" obvious you'll enjoy this movie.",1371600000,2,308,4.4035087719298245
4657819,5,B005DCJ2RW,"The reviewers who gave this film five stars are correct, but for the wrong reasons. They mistakenly believe this to be a ghost story (A ""true"" ghost story at that!). What it really is, however, is the most action packed 87 minutes of all out bird against outhouse defecation you're likely ever to see!
  The reviewers who gave the film one star are correct as well, but also for the wrong reasons. They too mistake this film as a ghost story, and call it a turd. Had they seen it for what it actually is; that being a film about birds angrily attempting to prevent turds, then I'm sure they would have agreed that it's a blast!
  In scene after scene, anybody attempting to drop the kids off at the pool in the wooden outhouse in the woods is met by an onslaught of kamikaze avian warriors determined to interrupt their efforts.
  The action isn't limited to the daylight hours either. Even at night, when the female star sends her male visitor out into the woods to pinch his rye, he's apparently met with the resistence of an entire owl squadron! I can't be certain of the species, seeing as how the artistic genius of the director saw fit not to actually show the birds, only allow us to hear them pelting the sides of the old-time porta potty. It made for one of the most dramatic and action packed sequences of the film all the same!
  I'm already seeing the potential for a cult following along the lines of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where exuberant fans will wear drab colored clothing to late night showings of the film, and throw their stuffed bird props at the screen during appropriate scenes. Women will wear their T-shirts supporting their favorite team. Move over Edward and Jacob.... it's time for Team Ghost Who Stares And Says Nothing and Team Ghost Who Whispers Stupid Stuff Into Your Ears to shine. Each team will have their own bird species to cheer on, and the feathers WILL fly!!!
  I recommend everybody simply hold their bowels until the end of the movie though. We wouldn't want a flock of ticked off shrikes to bombard you if you leave the theatre to use the bathroom!",1371600000,,2099,4.514511873350924
4657820,1,B005DCJ2RW,"If you like watching paint dry, then you might enjoy this film. Man, it is one boring flick, and it has no scary scenes at all. Pass.",1370390400,,133,3.962962962962963
4657821,3,B005DCJ2RW,"If nothing else, this is certainly an interesting movie. It's paced extremely slowly and though it's presented as a horror movie I don't think I would categorize it that way. It's more of a ""supernatural drama"" if that's a category...

The cinematography is impressive and though Conrad Pope's score starts off a bit overbearing (the first 15 minutes or so of the film are completely without dialogue so the score seems to be working overtime to provide an aural environment for the film), it winds up adding quite a bit of atmosphere, enhancing the slow pacing throughout.

There's not much plot to speak of: The Woman (Mira Sorvino) seeks refuge for an unknown reason at a remote cabin where Ghost (Shane West) is already holed up alone. The Man (Justin Kirk) shows up to ask The Woman to marry him, but The Man in Black (Tony Curran) has other, more devious plans for the couple. The central theme here seems to be about eradicating painful memories and experiences (and perhaps spirits of those who still ""haunt"" us) so that we can move forward with our lives.

Overall, I liked the implication that perhaps ghosts are simply issues in our own psyches that we need to work through, rather than separate entities. And I also appreciated the (mostly) subtle execution of the story. Unfortunately, the film suffers from a number of flaws: Sorvino is miscast, the script is quite painfully stilted throughout and the ending is entirely too heavy-handed after the subtlety of the rest of the film.

Still, for a modestly budgeted film that never had an official theatrical release, it's not bad. For the record, Justin Kirk raises the quality of the film a full star.",1368316800,,1666,4.794425087108014

Then there's the hooded figure that was in the boat that brought her and was again in the boat when it took her back--was that someone's else's demon they carry around or protective spirit, or hers??  I've read other reviews and even googled it trying to get some answers.  I've pieced some things together but the premise still haunts me (pun intended).  I might watch it again.

4657825,3,B005DCJ2RW,"An unnamed woman (played by Mira Sorvino) travels to a remote riverside cabin. Obviously she has a reason to live a seclude life, which we do not know for now. One thing is certain, however: someone else is also ""living"" in this cabin, stalking the woman day and night, though she doesn't seem to notice the presence of him.

The cabin may be haunted by a creepy apparition with a grim look on his face, but ""The Presence"" is not exactly a ""haunted house"" themed movie like ""The Amityville Horror."" Sorvino's character may have some paranormal experiences, but she does not appear to be scared very much. One may argue that ""The Presence"" is not a horror movie. It is more like subversion of the genre conventions.

The film makes some good points about so-called ""ghost stories."" A ghost doesn't have to be hostile to living humans. Also, the ghost (or whatever you call him/her) may be emotionally attached to someone else, like Patrick Swayze's character in a 1990 film ""Ghost."" Unlike the romantic drama, however, the supernatural existences in ""The Presence"" can do harms to the humans around them mentally or maybe physically.

I like the basic idea of ""The Presence,"" as well as the film's beautiful photography and nice score, but unfortunately, the film doesn't have much to offer beyond that. Many scenes feel drawn out, especially the first 18 minutes, in which there is no dialogue at all. I like the film's experimental aspect of the narrative, which soon gets repetitious and boring. The acting of the players (all in six) including Mira Sorvino is just adequate.

""The Presence"" is based on a premise stretched out beyond its limit, that is better suited for a short film or an episode for TV show.",1346025600,3,1713,4.777027027027027
