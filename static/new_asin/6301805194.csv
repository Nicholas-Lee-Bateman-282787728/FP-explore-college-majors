368624,5,6301805194,"Most Robin Hood enthusiasts agree that this Goldcrest series from the 1980s (originally aired in the U.S. on Showtime) is the best film/video version of the Robin Hood legend ever conceived. The 26 episode British mini-series begins with this episode (""Robin Hood And The Sorceror""), following Robin of Locksley's transformation from a humble yeoman to outlaw Robin Hood. The casting is AWESOME. Michael Praed is PERFECT as Robin. In fact, EVERYONE is perfect in this cast. Writer Richard Carpenter expanded on the legend as we know it by adding an element of occultism and sorcery. Some may find the result to be a bit too 1980s and a little too Dungeons & Dragons, but the magic never really departs from the many existing myths of Europe (I thought the addition of the Herne the Hunter character was SO cool). The addition of a Sarecen character was a particularly clever move (so clever that Kevin Costner STOLE the idea for his own production several years later!). BTW - this entire series IS available in a limited edition region 1 DVD set from Network Video (I ordered my copy direct from England), so Robin Hood fans, don't despair! The dvd extras are GREAT! Interviews with the cast and crew are fantastic! Even my girlfriend fell in love with this series, and she HATES swords & sorcery fantasy flicks (she's watched the series several times now!). I must confess, however, that I really only like the first 13 episodes. The last half of the series experienced some changes in casting, directors, and screenwriters. Carpenter was very clever to insert the Robert of Huntington character (most scholars try to narrow down the identity of Robin Hood to Robin of Locksley and Robert of Huntington), but the style and content of the Huntington episodes are not of the same quality as the first 13 episodes (which is really quite sad). Still, this is one of the best DVD purchases I've made so far. That 13th episode (""The Greatest Enemy"") alone was worth the price of the whole set! That's one of the most powerful things I've ever seen on television! Kevin Costner, eat your heart out!",1096502400,27,2093,4.800554016620499
368625,5,6301805194,"I used to watch this show when I was a child and it is one of the best stories I have seen.. :) I hope I will be able to find more episodes. I think there were at least eight parts to it.
Does anybody know where I can find the rest of it?",1074556800,6,238,3.425925925925926
368626,5,6301805194,"I grew up in the eighties watching this show on PBS, and have been searching for it on DVD. It was such a beautifully crafted show, and such a perfect encapsulation of that period in history. For a history buff, it is  dream, and for anyone interested in alternative religions, like Wicca, it paints a true and unbiased picture of Paganism.
Also, Michael Praed is extremely attractive, and that helps. This show needs to be available on DVD! I would buy every episode.",1054512000,18,468,4.63855421686747

The UK has them on DVD.
WHY CAN""T SOMEONE GET IT IN GEAR AND BRING THEM HERE TOO!!!
FYI the DVD set that exists is not a region 0 that was an error. The company that produces the Robin Hood DVD doesn't have the US reproduction rights so you cannot get the current DVD and watch it without an All-Region DVD player.",1029369600,10,510,4.0594059405940595
368629,5,6301805194,"During the early 80's a british version of robin hood was done for television.  This features a young Michael Praed as robin in the hood. (Some fans may recall him from the series shown on the scifi channel ""The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne"").  Not like many of the movies or even aninamted shows based off of Robin Hood this show was looking at it from a historical view point instead of a mythical apporach.  The first time I watched this was off a public televsion station during the late 80's when the show finally ended it's short time.  With a unqine cast to represent Robin Hood and his band of men.  Not merry but a band of men and of course one woman.  Like all televison shows of this kind many well noted british stars had guest roles and spots.  Even when Michael Praed left the show it was still good.  So if your looking for a different Robin Hood then this is the show to watch.",1015632000,5,897,4.2976190476190474

368657,5,6301805194,"Robin of Sherwood must be one of the most flattered filmed versions of the legend ever. This TV series (which, by the way, was not made by the BBC and was instead shown on the British commercial channel ITV -- something that most North American video guides get wrong) was the brainchild of Richard Carpenter, a creator of many notable British children's series. I love this show and I used to watch on TV and recorded on tapes for extra enjoyment over and over! Sadly all my tapes are exausted, and now it's time to get it on original DVDs! Praed played this role with a beautiful fey quality. You could believe that his Robin was almost messianic, subject to visions and in touch with divine forces. When Praed left at the end of series two, the show did not merely re-cast the part of Robin of Loxley. I personally think NO ACTOR can portrait the image of Robin better than Praed! The ending of the show is very sad to me! ;_;

Now, it's hard to get the complete collection though where can I find it! And please, give us this great tv show on DVD!!!",1106956800,8,1053,4.345177664974619
7815763,1,6301805194,I grew suspicious at the first scene.  Bad production values are evident.  I was able to get 5 minutes into it before I just had to give up.  I'm pretty sure people get paid to pad the reviews with five star responses.,1525478400,,218,4.142857142857143
7815764,5,6301805194,"This show has been a favorite of mine seeing it in the 1980's.  Beautiful scenery, very talented acting, and a amazing soundtrack makes this show timeless.  I really do hope that Amazon will bring the entire series on so we can have the entire Saga of Robin and his band of Merry Men giving the Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne a good what for in the name of the good citizens of England.

7815767,4,6301805194,"Thanks for bringing this back, it's such a treat.
But how odd, that Amazon doesn't even mention Michael Praed, the obvious star of the show, in the listed actors. This gorgeous Robin Hood is who made the show a huge hit when it came out in the 1980's. The urgent social dilemma of the 1980's is reflected in the mission given to Robin, that he must save and feed the homeless, the starving and the poor. At the time, the 1980's,  the ultra conservatives had come into power and were cutting social programs, and that's when homelessness started to become a serious issue, in the US and I suppose Britain.
Very engaging show, and makes one want to disappear into the forest with a bunch of friends...... But they really should have left out ""Herne"" and all that silly dabbling in the occult. It removes authenticity, and just caters to the witchcraft and pagan craze that was so in vogue in Hollywood and other places.  Paganism certainly was extinct there at the actual time of the ""real"" Robin Hood figures of medieval England, on whom the legend is based. It was the much earlier Celts who had worshipped an antlered forest ""god"", previous to the Saxons' (English) reign, who had ruled for hundreds of years until the Norman conquest. That emphasis on paganism really takes away from the show, makes it a bit awkward and unbelievable, and feels like an obvious attempt to subvert audience members who may be disenfranchised and looking for alliance with something that's rebellious.",1521331200,2,1484,4.748062015503876
7815768,5,6301805194,"This is not just my favorite version of Robin Hood, it's probably my favorite TV show of all time.  I have them all on DVD, but it's cool to see them here on Prime to expose a new generation to this telling of the Robin Hood story.

This is a version of Robin Hood steeped in the historical world of Anglo-Norman England, and it speaks to the ethnic mix of Normans, Saxons, native Celts, and the influence of the crusade era Middle East without resorting to the ridiculously ahistorical ""diversity"" tropes that would be required of a British television production today.

Throw in a wonderful element of sword and sorcery, and it's the recipe for a winner.",1521072000,6,656,4.589743589743589

I hope you won't do the same mistake as HULU and don't release all the episodes. They left out the most important episode in series two and hafe of series 3 is missing. You cant enjoy the show if cant see all the episodes. Dont make the same mistake.,1519948800,7,350,4.014285714285714
