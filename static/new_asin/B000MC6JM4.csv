8167729,5,B000MC6JM4,"To the stubbornly politically correct who would like to clean up the past as well as the present, most of these cartoons are simply offensive.  To those interested in history, in knowing about the past as it actually was, the cartoons are highly informative as reminders of how things used to be.  Americans during World War II were deeply racist as well as wholeheartedly patriotic, and these cartoons allowed them to laugh not only at the nation's enemies but also at its oppressed minorities, including Blacks and Hispanics in particular.  At least one of these cartoons has been banned for decades, and others are shown today with some scenes pruned.  Perhaps that is just as well, since most Americans have no realistic knowledge of history to begin with and would not be able to see these cartoons in their proper perspective.  But to those who can, I say: view them and learn!
