8496752,3,B006DU99DU,"The storyline to this movie is an an interesting premise. I was intrigued by the inter racial marriage of an Asian woman who marries a white guy when her brother passes away. I really had no idea how the story would turn out. If I read the script on the page it seems like a decent thriller with the turns and twists. I already knew of the British actor Kenny Doughty before seeing Irreversi, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. I took to Mei Melancon in the role of Linda. She is a very expressive actress. I really haven't seen her in too much but she plays the role of a naiive girl well. Estella Warren could be the best I've ever seen her. Ian Bohen is fine, though his newer tv roles is where he has found his stride. There are a few overly dramatic camera movements that are a little distracting and overdone. But this is not his fault.

But then there is the cheap looking way it's filmed. Unoriginal lifetime movie, colors. So minus a star for the set design. minus a star for the strange scene set ups.",1359417600,,1028,4.218274111675127
