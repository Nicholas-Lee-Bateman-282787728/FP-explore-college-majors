3923666,5,B002FP1426,"The term ""coming-of-age"" is often over-used when describing movies, and I have a tendency to shy away from those that state so on the DVD case.  However, I picked up Lymelife mainly due to the great cast.  I was not disappointed.

I was drawn into this movie immediately.  There is superb character development, particularly in Rory Culkin's Scott Bartlett.  The deep, bordering on love friendship he has with Emma Roberts' Adrianna is perfectly portrayed.  These two are obviously the center point of the film, but there are so many other characters that, although secondary, do not seem any less significant.  Alec Baldwin sets aside his terrific humor and gives a splendid performance as Scott's tough-love father.  And I'll agree with another reviewer who asked where's the Oscar nomination for Timothy Hutton?  His Lyme disease-suffering Tommy is spectacular.  The bar scene with him and Baldwin is nothing short of masterful.

Lymelife is a little known film with several big names in it.  I would hazard to guess that most people you would ask had never heard of it.  I for one immediately told several people to watch it right away.  And I'm recommending it here.",1265155200,,1171,4.969072164948454
3923667,5,B002FP1426,"This movie invoked bittersweet memories of growing up on Long Island.  It was a pitch perfect tale of a young man becoming a man - Confirmation according to his mom or to him, his first sexual encounter.

Even though the movie was set in Syosset, Long Island - it will remind anyone of their own hometown during the mythical time of leaving childhood behind during the late 70s.  I thought the whole Catholic way of life was the main character in this movie along with the interpersonal relationships between two neighboring families.  They started out as one big happy family until circumstances (lyme disease and a wandering eye) lead to the current withered state of affairs. This movie shined the brightest when dealing with relationship issues (husband/wife, father/son, mother/son, mother/daughter, sibling, and boy/girl relationships as well as the relationship you have with yourself - Timothy Hutton's deer gazing).  These scenes were poignant and the acting was spot on.

The story and emotions in this movie rang eerily true. I think it will speak louder to those who grew up on Long Island but I recommend it to anyone who appreciates slice of life films.",1262044800,,1167,4.989690721649485

Ok, so it's a true story. The script is fair enough, direction too. The acting is uniformly decent, with Baldwin as usual stealing the show. The lead is likeable enough. So why didn't I enjoy this film?

Good question. Probably because it's just a little too realistic, meaning there's a lack of redemption, or whatever it is that makes art art and life not so art. I just found it all too bleak, in a very bland sort of way. Yes, the suburbs are full of deception and disappointment and dismay and d-everything. But that doesn't mean I want to watch them played out on screen...unless something really special and revealing occurs. And here, it doesn't.

Well done, but I'd recommend you watch American Beauty or Ordinary People or Kramer vs. Kramer or any of the many other superior suburban drams. Sadly, this one never gets there, despite good work all around.",1259539200,7,875,4.6688311688311686
3923669,1,B002FP1426,"Boring.  I bought it because I was raised on Long Island, and someone said it was a good movie.  Wasn't worth buying.  Alec Baldwin was at his worst.",1259452800,3,149,4.25
3923670,4,B002FP1426,"I am still shocked that some reviewer wrote ""laugh out loud funny"" after seeing this film. Granted, there are moments where you might smile. But more than anything, this film is sad; depicting the genuine heartache that is wrought when a family falls apart.
Baldwin and Nixon - both excellent actors - are good, but not brilliant. I expected better. The acting performance of Emma Roberts is terrible - that her aunt is Julia Roberts no doubt explains her being granted this role. Timothy Hutton, however, as the lyme-diseased, depressed husband who witnesses his wife's infidelity - deserves the highest accolades. His performance in this film is flawless, portraying a man suffering from a disease that has rendered him incapable of functioning as the man he once was. I found his performance riveting and heartbreaking. Kieran Culkin is the next Sean Penn - that is a given. His underscored performance as a love-struck, confused teen was excellent. And his brother - Rory Culkin - was also excellent. Hutton and the kids stole this film. I don't want to go over the plot - but I do recommend this film. It is well-done, and well-acted....but it's not ""laugh out loud funny"" at all. Whenever children suffer, there is little to laugh at.",1256342400,23,1240,4.881516587677726
3923671,5,B002FP1426,"I admit that I picked this for viewing because of Alec Baldwin. The guy may have had his shares of troubles but he is quite a charismatic actor (well, in some movies more than others).  Set in Long Island, N.Y., the time period is the mid-70s, and it also has two Culkin brothers in it. Rory Culkin portrays a 15-year-old, Scott Bartlett whose parents,real estate developer Mickey (Alec Baldwin in a wolfish and arrogant role) and passive mother, Brenda (Jill Hennessy) reflect the trappings of a successful life, but are not altogether happy in their marriage. Scott is however more concerned with the girl next door, attractive Adrianna (Emma Roberts of Nancy Drew) who sort of teases him, but has other romantic inclinations. Adrianna' mom, Melissa (Cynthia Nixon)works for Mickey, and portrays a long-suffering wife who has to deal with her Lyme-disease addled husband, Tommy (Timothy Hutton). Oh, and there's Scott's brother Jimmy (Kieran Culkin), who's on leave from the army.

The drama of the two families unfolds slowly, portraying the gradual unraveling of two marriages, whilst also delving into the sexual awakening of an adolescent boy who is tormented by his attraction to Adrianna, and also concerned about his parents' marriage. Rory Culkin does a credible job of playing the angsty teen, and grows on the viewer, eliciting one's empathy for the growing pains he goes through, without being overly melodramatic or sentimental. There's a good balance between the dark and light in this drama, and the ensemble cast does a great job in maintaining this balance, especially Alec Baldwin who plays true to type here.

The story is far from fresh or original,as there have been so many other movies made about dysfunctional families, and adolescence (one of my favorites is ""The Squid and the Whale"") yet it strikes a chord, and this is largely due to the heartfelt performance by Rory Culkin. Another well-made coming-of-age movie is The Education of Charlie Banks.",1254096000,15,1977,5.076923076923077
3923672,5,B002FP1426,"For lack of a better way to start out the review, I really enjoyed the film.  I've been waiting for the film to come out on DVD, since I couldn't see it in the theaters.  It was well worth the wait.

Lymelife centers on growing up during the 70s and focuses on members of two families struggling to face their dysfunction while making some sense of their lives and finding something positive to see them through the trials of human relationships.  The cast was really stellar especially Rory Culkin with his heartfelt, perfectly awkward portrayal of a young teenage boy discovering love for the first time, learning to stand up for himself and to accept his family with all their imperfections.  I expected great acting from the cast because they're so talented, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing out loud in specific moments when I least expected(not at the serious situations themselves but the irony of how those situations were written and given a dry, sarcastic wit in specific moments that were unexpected for me as a viewer), and this movie is not a comedy or lighthearted by any means.  While the film is 90 minutes or so, the Director Derick Martini did an excellent job of keeping the film flowing at a good pace and really giving a viewer like me an opportunity to get to know the characters and really feel a sincere connection to them.  I only wish it were longer and there were more scenes with Kieran Culkin and his real life brother Rory.  They obviously are close in real life as brothers and it was fun to watch them act together in a wonderful film and see that spark and spontaneity in their acting.

As always, Alec Baldwin and Timothy Hutton are strong actors who give their performances in the film a very grounding effect when one could choose not to be sympathetic to the actions of either of their characters.  Jill Hennessy did a very fine job as a mother of the two Culkin characters and the frustrated, ""good"" wife of Alec Baldwin.  Emma Roberts gave her character the right amount of worldliness and sensitivity and her chemistry with Rory Culkin was playful and believable, while Cynthia Nixon as the carefree wild wife gives a measured yet insightful performance.

All in all, I really liked the film.  I just wish there were more bonus materials for the film such as a Making Of and interviews with the cast.  There are many deleted scenes and an alternate ending to watch with commentary from both director Derick Martini and Rory Culkin.  I'd  still love to hear what they have to say about their characters and how they liked making the film, maybe they'll embellish the bonus materials in a later release.",1253836800,3,2663,4.6581196581196584
3923673,5,B002FP1426,"Not exactly a reference test for Blu, but the lower cost will hopefully help make this a nice addition to your independent collection.

This cast made for a very believable film set in an eastern suburban expansion circa Falklands time period. The story follows two Long Island families as the adults implode onto the mid-life crisis adultery kick and the teen kids wallow through their angst and hormones. Solid performances all around, but Tim Hutton was excellent playing the Lyme disease damaged dad, full with a PTSD-like personality that amazingly appears to have the most centered personality in this film. The meaningful scenes are both awkward and believable, and as the director states in the commentary, the film is filled with tons of these ""organic moments"".

The Blu quality is solid and the DTS sounds competent, but the few train scenes and gun sounds are all that travel to the outer channels. There is hardly any color in the film - ever, but the drab clothes and bleak landscapes still look vivid as can be in 1080. The supplements give this another star and include:
* 8 deleted scenes totaling 7:30 minutes, with an optional commentary. They all would have been fine in the film and helped show some fine acting.
* 4 minute (now infamous) alternate ending. Since they showed this film with different endings across the festival circuit, there has been a plethora of banter regarding the better of the endings. The film contains the ambiguous ending, this alternate ending (and much more believable for what was being shown) shows the graphic conclusion.
* Commentary with Rory Culkin and Derick Martini. Almost a how-to on making people turn off a commentary, but give it 10-15 minutes and they gradually get better at it. Includes some nice references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-400-Blows-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000E5LEV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 400 Blows - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;and the usual interesting tidbits on making an independent film with a stellar cast.

There are several laugh out loud moments, but go into this expecting a solid angst film with the typical suburbanized dysfunctional adults. The front cover art makes you think this is a ""violently funny"" film, but I will be categorizing this in the drama section. The only other thing to watch for is Screen Media embedded a red band trailer prior to the film (for Death in Love) when you press play, actually shows more skin than in the movie that follows.",1253404800,2,2517,5.240694789081886

3923739,3,B002FP1426,"Described in one publicity tag as ""a dark comedy,"" I am not sure whether Derek Martini's intense little film lives up to that description.  Set in Long Island, it focuses on a teenage protagonist Scott (Rory Culkin), who not only learns something about his family, but acquires new knowledge about those closest to him, especially his childhood friend Adrianna (Emma Roberts), whom he has known ever since he was eight years old.

Lyme's Disease is transmitted to human beings through infected blacklegged ticks.  Typical symptoms include fever, headaches and skin rash.  In Martini's film the disease functions as a kind of metaphor for the disease affecting everyone around Scott; his father Mickey (Alec Baldwin) conducts a clandestine affair with Adrianna's mother Melissa (Cynthia Nixon), while his mother appears not to notice; his brother Jimmy (Kieran Culkin) has gone off to military service as a means of escaping from his father; while Adrianna appears to be going out with older boys at his high school.  In this capitalist-oriented, meritocratic world, where Mickey believes that becoming a millionaire is a sign of 'success,' no one appears particularly interested in anyone around them.

Melissa's husband Charlie (Timothy Hutton) actually suffers from the disease, but nonetheless lives a life as false as anyone else's.  While pretending to go to the city each day to find a job, he actually incarcerates himself away in the bowels of his home doing drawings.

Set in the late Seventies, LYMELIFE offers an interesting critique of American lifestyles at that time; the obsession with money, masculinity and self-assertion that creates an alienated world.  There are some highly suggestive groupings: Scott and Adrianna are shown standing on either side of a railway line; they cannot seem to cross the line to meet together, but instead wait for a train to come past, remarking as they do so that it's always possible to hear a train anywhere in Long Island.  At the end of the film, they are shown sitting together in a school bus; they do not speak for a long time, until Adrianna relents and takes Scott's hand.  At least the youngsters are making tentative steps to create a less alienating world.

Sometimes the film makes use of rather obvious symbolism to prove its point: a family row is accompanied by the sound of Sinatra singing a love-song on the soundtrack; while there are several point of view shots of Charlie looking out through a barred upper window at an (imaginary) deer grazing immediately in front of his house.  Yet the action as a whole is redeemed by two strong central characterizations: Rory Culkin is especially good as the teenager pretending to be a strongman as he stands in front of the mirror, while Roberts proves herself to be a fundamentally generous soul in a sequence immediately following Scott's confirmation ceremony, when she swallows her pride and agrees to be his friend once more.",1416096000,,2942,5.041237113402062

3923743,3,B002FP1426,"First off this is NOT the ""laugh out loud, violently funny"" comedy that is advertised on the front of the box. There are some minor moments of humor and most of that is uncomfortably funny. The film takes place in 1979, with music from an earlier time, and a lame indie style soundtrack. Charley (Timothy Hutton) has Lyme disease. He is not all there, but is not totally out of it. His wife, Melissa (Cynthia Nixon) works for Mickey Bartlett (Alec Baldwin). He is an architect on Long Island and she sells real estate. Scott Bartlett (Rory Culkin) emulates his dad and has a love interest in Adrianna (Emma Roberts) the daughter of Charley and Melissa. Jimmy (Kieran Culkin) is Scott's brother who is home from leave from the army. Jill Hennessy plays Brenda, the unhappy wife of Mickey who wants to go back to the Queens.

The film was excellently acted and was perhaps too uncomfortable for my liking. There are scenes of adultery and fighting as the movie centers around how Scott copes with life in his ""coming of age"" story. If you are looking for a well acted indie drama about long island and Lyme disease, this is it. If you want a quirky laugh out loud fumy production, look elsewhere.

3923755,5,B002FP1426,"From the awkward opening scenes before the title comes up, all the way through the insanely intense ending, I was completely caught off guard.  The story is simple.  Teen boy lusts after neighboring teen girl, meanwhile the boy's parents are becoming more and more estranged.  His big brother comes home from service in the military and puts a whipping on the town bully.  Relationships intensify in both ways.  Some coming closer together while others fall apart.  That's really kind of it, in a nutshell.  The importance of this feature film lies in how the subject matter of family and relationships change.  It's quite funny at times and also dramatic at others.  None of it feels forced.  It all feels like a heightened version of real life.  The acting, from Baldwin to Emma Roberts, to both Rory and Kieran Culkin is nothing short of spectacular.  I've seen versions of this story before but the way this particular story is told made me feel like I was seeing this sort of story for the very first time.

3923756,5,B002FP1426,"Yes, Lymelife is actually a drama.  It's not a comedy.  If there's any comedy segments here, they only appear briefly before immediately switching back to drama scenes.

It's about... well actually, it's about two separate things (both involving relationships).

One of which is about Rory Culkin (WOW does he ever look like his older brother Macaulay!) trying to hit off a relationship with a girl who lives up the street.

Throughout the movie Rory's character and the girl seem to be nothing more than simple friends (and even THAT seems like a stretch) but then things change as the story moves along.  I wasn't really sure which direction the story was going involving these two characters, but I guess what ends up happening makes perfect sense by the conclusion of the film.  It's a teenage relationship and it was written in a nice way.

The other storyline is about Rory's parents (played by Alec Baldwin and Jill Hennessy) going through an extremely rocky marriage because of a constant cheating problem.  I don't want to spoil what actually happens though.  Let's just say, everyone in town apparently knows about it (including their own spouse!) but nothing ever really happens... at least, it initially *seems* like nothing will ever happen.  This is an even bigger storyline than the other one with Rory's character.

Overall, yes, this is definitely not a comedy.  This is a storyline that quite possibly many people out there can relate to.  Perhaps even being able to place themselves in Rory Culkin's shoes.  It's a really good storyline though.  It's simple, definitely not out of the realm of possibility, and it kept my interest from beginning to end.",1281052800,,1672,4.939068100358423

Sure, it deals with dysfunction in American families that is very much tied to social pressures and the need to conform and succeed, and yes, it's occasionally bleak and hard-hitting in its observations, but Lymelife comes from a deeper, more personal place.  Reflecting the experience of the filmmakers (directed by Derick Martini from a script co-written with his brother Steven), the film feels much more affectionate and realistic in its reminiscence of youth and of growing up, capturing a sense of life during a key period in the 70s, without idealising the experience or shying away from the harsh truths.

Strictly speaking, the period isn't the decade for the filmmakers own coming-of-age, but there's a realisation that much of what has shaped the world they live in comes from their family background in the 70s.  In places like suburban Long Island, there was indeed a mini boom and a chance to live the American Dream and Scott's father Mickey (Alec Baldwin) is one of those men pursuing his dream to build that dream through his construction company.  Despite the wealth that this brings, all is not happy in the Bartlett household, and the constant pursuit to succeed is putting stress on the family, as is Mickey's carrying on of an affair with his neighbour.  Scott meanwhile - superbly played by Kieran Culkin - has his own concerns, dealing with bullying in school and trying to take his childhood friendship with Adrianna (Emma Roberts) onto a new level, but the slightly older girl is quickly developing beyond the reach of an adolescent still obsessed with Star Wars.

The fact that the 70s isn't the filmmaker's own experience does show up in one or two minor anachronisms (the Falklands issue would scarcely have figured here in America, least of all at this time), but essentially the observations are true and put across keenly and with a degree of subtlety for the most part (the slow, creeping effects of Lyme disease afflicting Adrianna's father representative of the wider breakdown of values), but it's also able to hit hard when required to do so.  It does retread ground covered in many US films of this kind - Noah Baumbach's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Squid-and-the-Whale/dp/B000CS464G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Squid and the Whale</a>&nbsp;also comes to mind, as does his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Margot-at-the-Wedding/dp/B0011NVC8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Margot at the Wedding</a>&nbsp;- but, although produced by Martin Scorcese, there's a nice indie sensibility to Lymelife and some fine performances that should help distinguish it and even lift it above the crowd.",1280966400,,2953,5.8671328671328675

3923763,3,B002FP1426,"""Lymelife"" is a curious film with a good cast that takes its name from one of the characters -- Jim Hutton -- having lyme disease and related psychological illness as a result. This is strange, since he is a part player in this dramedy that is a thinly-veiled copy of the 1999 Academy Award winner ""American Beauty""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

As in the earlier movie, ""Lymelife"" features two suburban families that interact, first through their children (played by Rory Culkin and Emma Roberts), then through an extramarital affair via work, and finally through an interaction between the two husbands that results in firearms becoming involved. If you saw ""American Beauty,"" you know the exact same pattern of events happened in that film. The ending here is a little different.

I enjoyed this film most of the way through, until it became obvious this was ""American Beauty Pt. 2."" The work with the teenage kids is the best part of the movie. Their relationship is realistic, touching, involving and sometimes funny. It is not really about growing up or, to use the cliche, coming of age, as much as it is the foil for the relationships between the parents and the contrast with the two dysfunctional families (Cliche No. 2.)

The one original thing about ""Lymelife"" is its title and purpose; it is without doubt the first feature film designed on the basis of Lyme disease. I hadn't heard anyone talk about that for a few years before seeing this movie. Maybe the sequel with be ""Swine Flu Life.""",1265932800,4,1667,5.379310344827586
8369407,1,B002FP1426,"Someone bought this movie for me because she knew I had Lyme Disease. When I received it,  I thought it would be a good movie about Lyme and it looked to have a good cast.  It was not about Lyme at all!  There was one guy who had it, but they barely showed him and he had no significant part in the movie.  Oh.  He shot a deer presumably in the end - big deal!  Absolutely nothing to be learned from the movie.  The only thing they did well was their use of 70's style film coloring, but even the music was all over the place.  Why are they playing music from the 50's in a 70's movie with so many great 70's songs available?  Trashy sex scenes, lots of beatings and violence, just a mess.  Kept waiting for something to redeem the movie, but it never came.  A Scorcese film?  Really?  Not sure how he could attach his name to it.  Also, the dvd box says ""violently funny"" and ""lol funny""- seriously?  Absolute lies, there is not one funny scene or line in the movie.  It is a very dark, pointless drama.",1526342400,,1004,4.124352331606218

8369409,3,B002FP1426,"The movie was ""Meh"", but the acting was pretty good.  It was an ok, indie-type movie...It definitely revolved more around struggling relationships between two families, and the life of a teenage boy in love with a girl and trying to get her attention.  However, as a person who has Lyme disease, and for a movie titled #Lymelife, I was hoping to see some more of the struggles surrounding how Lyme was a part of this ""life"".  The movie doesn't really do a good job of explaining why Charlie had such a difficult time coping or finding a job, or why his marriage was struggling.  It made it seem more like the person afflicted with Lyme was just this crazy person who sat inside all day for no reason.  In fact, most Lyme sufferers struggle daily with multiple physical and mental symptoms...even in this day and age (even 40+ years later).  I imagine back in the 70s, there was even less knowledge about it or options for treatment (penicillin??).  Perhaps that is the point they were trying to get at...that he had Lyme, and doctors didn't even know what it was (which is still true to this day)....hence his speech in the bar about docs saying he had ""MS"" or ""Syphilis"", and people always questioning if the disease was ""real"" (everyone saying it was psychosomatic).  I also liked that every time they showed Charlie, there was that high-squealing music, which I interpret as ""ringing in his ears"", a common symptom in Lyme disease.  But they didn't really show his daily struggles - Depression? Anxiety?  Pain? Brain fog? etc?  What the hell was his obsession with the deer, and drawing the deer?  I'm a hunter also, and I don't feel any personal vendetta against nature...stuff happens, and it's a risk you take living in this tristate area and going outdoors!  My question is...would the average person watching this movie know what any of this movie means in regards to Lyme?  I sure wouldn't, if I didn't personally have Lyme and have done all my own research.  Just wishing there was a tad more insight on the ""Lyme"" part of the #Lymelife movie, and a little less family drama surrounding cheating...I guess it is this drama that makes movies.  But then perhaps it should have been called #Cheatinglife.",1516838400,,2211,4.703896103896104
