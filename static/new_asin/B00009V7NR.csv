7993080,4,B00009V7NR,"I really enjoyed the anime set. My brother told me about it because it was a gift for him. He is an anime fanatic. I didn't know what to expect from it because of the way some of the other anime is created. I watched it and got hooked on it. Deep and dark storyline draws you in. Way better than Dragonball Z. It has some of the magical element of Inuyasha, but it is better than it, too. I like all action packed animes, but this one really caught me because of the storyline and the fighting technique. If you don't like it or think you won't like it, sit down and watch it on a day you don't have anything else to do. You will be hooked on it. Overall, thumbs up. Great set.",1285113600,,677,3.985294117647059
7993081,1,B00009V7NR,"For the record: an anime adaptation doesn't have to be slavishly faithful to the manga for me to enjoy it. But it DOES have to make sense.

Sadly things get even more bizarre and out-of-control in ""Samurai Deeper Kyo - Curse of Tokugawa,"" the second volume of the series. These five episodes are a seemingly random blur of monsters, swords, weird conspiracies that never quite pan out, and Kyo acting decidedly unbloodthirsty. Oh, and we finally find out who that white-haired guy in the opening credits is... and he only makes things even more confusing.

Kyo and his little gang arrive in Edo for the Shogun's tournament, and unsurprisingly Kyo and Benitora qualify for the finals easily. Also in the finals: Yukimura (in drag) and Megeira, who's a sort of.... white-haired space ninja with a gun arm. He's also POed at Kyo, for unclear reasons.

Unsurprisingly, the dastardly Ieyasu is also plotting something evil behind the scenes, and doing some fairly nasty things to the tournament's losers. And when Yukimura goes up against an opponent he knows all too well, Ieyasu reveals his true motivations... and his true form. To destroy him, the gang must use the Ieyasu family treasure, which won't allow just anybody to pick it up.

But things don't improve after Kyo and Co. go off to find Kyo's body -- Yuya encounters a mysterious young man with a deadly grudge toward Kyo, and she and Kyo are cornered by a lethal puppet-master who can deceive even the sharpest eyes.

I tried hard to like the ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" anime, but it's just too much of a disaster. While this whole arc made logical sense in the original manga, the scriptwriters inexplicably decided to turn all the villains into crazy evil monsters and slap new motivations onto almost all the characters. Even Kyo suddenly becomes a big gooey-centered softie who wants to avenge some girl he had to kill years and years ago. Wha?

And ""Samurai Deeper Kyo - Curse of Tokugawa"" is an unmitigated disaster of a story throughout the first three episodes, with zero suspense (maybe because there's hardly any MOTION in the fights?) and leaden humor. The last two episodes improve somewhat, with some (literally) chilling scenes involving evil puppets and the blind, eerily friendly Akira.

Even the animation and the dub are off -- half the time the images are still shots (especially during fights), and Yukimura's epic fight is shown as a pair of twirling CGI characters waving sticks at each other. Benitora has a Southern drawl 95% of the time, and Megeira... well, he sounds like a Russo-Cuban by way of Transylvania. The voice actor even mocks it in the bloopers (""Lucy, you gotta lot of SPLAININ to do!"").

And the characters are getting more headscratching by the episode. Benitora's mysterious past is finally revealed in full... just in time for him to have a soppy sentimental reunion with a relative. And bloodthirsty, thousand-man-slaying Kyo is getting less menacing with every episode -- mostly he just hangs around, glares and snickers evilly. And Meguira is... well, he's an anime-original character, and he spends most of these episodes leaping around and making dramatic threats against Kyo.

""Samurai Deeper Kyo - Curse of Tokugawa"" feels like it was made up along the way, with increasingly bizarre characters and an even weirder storyline. Best if watched on drugs.",1269561600,,3353,4.930851063829787
7993082,5,B00009V7NR,"This anime has moved to the top three in my list of favorite animes. I love Berserk, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Big O, Armitage (all of them), Escaflowne, Rocord Of Lodoss, & many more. Demon Eyes Kyo is now tied at second place with Cowboy Bebop.
I absolutely loved each of the main characters. They had great humor and complete loyalty to one another.
I purchased the complete collection because of some happy reviews that I read. I had no idea what to expect and I fell in love with the series ten minutes into the first episode. It felt, somewhat, like watching the FOX TV series '24' in the fact that you just couldn't get enough and had to keep watching to see what was going to happen next.
To me, it was completely worth every dollar spent. I wear my new 'Samuri Deeper Kyo' t-shirt with extreme pride!",1089763200,3,805,4.409395973154362
7993083,5,B00009V7NR,"This DVD really outdoes the last. More characters are introduced, yet you will probably be inquisitive about each one. This series really reminds me of ""Blade of the Immortal"". Blade had a similar fashion of creating great characters and inventive weapons. The Japanese Voices really did a great job. Everyone sounds perfect. I usually watch both English and Japanese because I want to milk the DVD for all it's worth. The English people though do have a slightly awkward way of talking, and Samurai Deeper Kyo's voice sounds like he is an idiot.
The plot thickens a lot and basically establishes what may or may not happen (i.e.- the 5 weapons). The animation is improved vastly as characters move a lot more. Also, as I said earlier, the characters increase in number, and introduce some note-worthy additions. Mahiro just became my favorite character.
The problems? Yoko? Yoka? Yoyo? Who is this girl? That girl introduced in the first DVD is the one problem. She is there for revenge. The second episode on the first DVD reveals that she is looking for the guy who killed her brother. Guess who it is. I guessed perfectly because it is so obvious. With the exclusion of Yoka and her flat plot, every character is great.",1074384000,2,1223,4.773584905660377
7993084,1,B00009V7NR,"Come on, people -- get real.  ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" is, at least to me, an extremely watered-down version of ""Rurouni Kenshin.""
I got to see this monstrosity at a weekly social convention called Anime Night, at the university I attend.  The maniac who runs it, who we just threw out because his taste in anime is pathetic, made us watch two DVD's in a row of this nonsense.  The first week, for the first disc, I wasn't present, but I was there to watch the first episode and a half of this disc...in ENGLISH.  Not only was I extremely tired of this type of anime storyline (I've seen enough ""Rurouni Kenshin"" and ""Ninja Scroll"" and related films for even a short lifetime), but I was disgusted by the poor English voice acting.  The prime example is that character, whose name I can't recall, who wears the bandana and is from Osaka.  The problem?  His voice actor is speaking with an EXTREMELY STEREOTYPICAL SOUTHERN U.S. ACCENT!!  It's idiotic, and I'm sick of this in anime, not just this one.  It's like he came from the part of Japan that used to own slaves.
Don't even think of buying this garbage.  Spend your money on better anime series and films; goodness knows they'll all be better than this.",1070409600,,1204,4.532407407407407
7993085,5,B00009V7NR,i think the movie overall is very good if your into the whole samurai thing. i also think that the whole outlook of it was well planned out. it remines me of the book .in all good dvd,1070236800,4,183,3.8421052631578947
7993086,4,B00009V7NR,"I have to admit that this is one of those DVD series that, while I find myself really enjoying both the acting and the art, I'm not at all sure what the series is really about.  First I thought it was the story of a body with a problem - two inhabited by two different enemies that were deadly enemies during the battle of Sekigahara that made Ieyasu Tokugawa that Shogun of Japan.  Now I'm not so sure.
Demon Eyes Kyo, who is one of the two is 'the killer of a thousand.'  He is a cold, calculating, thoroughly unpleasant and deadly samurai.  Somehow he has gathered around him a host of 'loyal' companions who would give their eye teeth to fight with him to the death,  These include Yukimura Sanada, who wants to rule Japan, Benetora, who is really Ieyasu's son Hidetaka.  There are several others whom I haven't quite figured out yet, including a gun-toting lady bounty hunter, and another with a gatling gun for a forearm (Migeira).
The early episodes focus on a competition among the Shogunate's foremost fighters, the prize is the cursed spear of the Tokugawa.  Before you start to wonder why anyone would risk dying for a cursed spear keep in mind that this turns out to be an important plot device (the spear is one of the 'great' weapons of the Murumasa) and that what the Shogun really wants to do is kill off or zombify the most dangerous men in Japan.  Or rather, maybe that's what he wants or maybe it's what someone else wants him to want.
Then we are off to search for Kyo's true body, which was hidden away by the man whose body he now inhabits.  Once he has it he will gain incredible powers.  Whether this is good or bad is still unclear.  But it does provide the basis for the classic Japanese picareque journey from battle to battle.  The first of these is with Kubira, one of the Jyunishinshou or Twelve Heavenly Generals.  One who likes to play with dolls.
Confused a bit - so am I.  But the show is really enjoyable enough to make it worth waiting until things start to make any overall sense.  For now there are plenty of dramatic moments and spectacular fights to keep the viewer's attention.  One thing though, whatever you do, do not listen to the English dubbing.  They decided to implement some Japanese regional accents with non-Japanese equivalents.  So Benitora has a southern drawl and Migeira sounds like Dracula.  It's so bad it's embarassing.  Otherwise, this is a thoroughly enjoyable series.",1068681600,6,2430,4.555299539170507
7993087,5,B00009V7NR,"This is my favorite anime series of all time. The character and plot developement are excellent and cant be met. The action scenes were carried out flawlessly with precision and great timing. The music during the series is nothing short of remakable and very catchy.
I would recommend this series to anyone who is a true anime fan",1065657600,,330,4.706896551724138
