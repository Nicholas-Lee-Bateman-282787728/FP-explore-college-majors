2934219,4,B000VA3JDO,"Great show ! The DVD film quality is not crisp and clear, but I'm assuming it's because it's a regional issue. My player can play the foreign region, but I think because it's not it's native region, it changes the appearance of the video. Otherwise it's a great show ! Love it !",1406160000,,278,4.264150943396227
2934220,1,B000VA3JDO,"This was reccommended to me by an old friend. I usually like the British ""dry"" sense of humor, but this this performer stoops to stupidity.",1379894400,,139,4.6
2934221,5,B000VA3JDO,"People who gave this product one star because it's Region two are just dummies who didn't read the entire product description. How the heck do you not know that it's not a region one dvd? And what does that have to do with the quality of the product itself?
The dvd plays fantastically on my all region dvd players and the actual content is wonderful and hilarious. I was surprised that one of the Christmas specials was included as well as a behind the scenes talk with Catherine herself about her characters and there was even a commentary for a handful of sketches in the third season's series. All together it was wonderful to watch and I've enjoyed putting it on when I need a good laugh. I'm sad there were only three seasons, but kudos to them for finishing strong and ending on a high note.",1356480000,3,798,4.4353741496598635
2934222,5,B000VA3JDO,"This DVD set shipped from the UK so I wasn't expecting it to get to me quickly.  It did get here within a reasonalbe amount of time though and the DVDs arrived in perfect condition.  I would definately buy from this distributor again.  The show itself is absolutely fantastic.  I watched the series originally on Netflix, and loved it so much I wanted to buy it.  Catherine Tate is a brilliant British comedian and I was super excited to see that she is on the American version of The Office this season.  Keep in mind that you need a region free DVD player to watch this series.  There are so many great British series that aren't available in Region 1 format that it's worth it to get a region free DVD player.",1349654400,3,712,4.348484848484849
2934223,1,B000VA3JDO,The third dvd should have a Region 1 version.  I want the boxset that we can watch in America!!  I M Bovverd!!!,1342828800,,111,4.0
2934224,1,B000VA3JDO,"The seller was gracious enough to allow a return of an opened package; however, if you live in the United States this DVD (Region 2) will not work in your BluRay / DVD Player.  I recommend Catherine Tate, though be careful not to purchase a DVD for a different region and ensure you purchase for the U.S. or 'Region 1'.",1337731200,,319,4.316666666666666
2934225,5,B000VA3JDO,I had no problems playing this show in my region free dvd player. It was here within 7 business days and I ordered it during the holidays. The show extremely funny!! Buy it!,1295740800,3,173,4.2727272727272725
2934226,1,B000VA3JDO,"I've never heard of a dvd  NOT playing on a dvd player before.
Please be careful when purchasing dvds that say REGION 2 on them - I had no idea this dvd would not work in my player.
Would have been nice if the seller had contacted me to be sure that I KNEW that this DVD would not play on American dvd players....what a waste.
Service is just not part of the deal with this seller.
Some sellers just care about the sale and not the person they are selling to. Such a shame!
If I was selling a product that did not work in England - I'd be sure my English customers knew this..because I care about people too...not just making a buck.
Very sad.",1287446400,,643,4.062992125984252
8217709,5,B000VA3JDO,"The amount of one star reviews because the reviewer bought the wrong format is sad. This happens all the time, the region is clearly stated in the item description yet there is review after review on items like this. The purchasers mistake is unfairly being taken out on the product or the seller. Get it right people its not hard.",1524009600,,331,4.533333333333333
