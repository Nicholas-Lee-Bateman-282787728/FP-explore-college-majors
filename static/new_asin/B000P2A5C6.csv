8188579,5,B000P2A5C6,"Pushing the envelope with saucy wit and bawdy hilarity, this pirate adventure is destined to spawn its own cult following.  Centered around Captain Scurvy Dog, a rock and roll buccaneer original, we meet a colorful cast of characters in the Caribbean Pub. Elwood Carlisle is a comic gem as Driftwood, a befuddled old man who lives at the bar. (Veteran character actor Carlisle has recently made a name for himself on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno.)  This movie stretches the laughs to new limits like a late-night comedy, and will demand repeated viewings. One sequence aboard the pirate ship complete with cannon fire plays like a surreal rock and roll music video. You can almost smell the salty sea air and feel the wind on your face as you gaze over the ship's bow to the vast sea. Inspired animation, irreverent comedy, and flat-out silly fun mark this as a true original.",1186876800,3,880,4.745098039215686
