8428466,5,B004FZWDR4,"This is a solid series for sure.  Its mystical in nature and remiss of Legend.  (the movie with the Big red devil played by Tim Curry) The setting is that of a middle earth type, and the story is told dynamically.
this was a sleeper hit because I didn't hear of it until comic con. The animation is nice and crisp, and the voice acting isn't the same old lame actors that are in every other anime.
Guin saga is adult themed but engaging for the younger audience too. If you like Lodoss War or Berserk, or animes with that type of background, then this is worth buying.  straight Up! Cant wait for the second volume!",1429142400,,615,4.2844827586206895

8428468,2,B004FZWDR4,"As for the anime, I would have to say it's so so. The characters are likable enough on their own. But the English acting in this anime is really bad and I mean really bad. At times I started to think the voice actors just made up the dialog. The changes in their emotion was completely unbelievable. One second this big emotional stage was set, then the character would just go back to normal, as if nothing happened. At one point I almost stopped to smack my head.(real line of the English Dub.) ""In my powerful man arms, I'm going to find my super awesome destiny!"" If I was watching this on a kid's cartoon channel, as a child. I might find this to be entertaining. All in all, the anime was fine. The English Dub was a travesty.",1315526400,4,732,4.273381294964029
8428469,4,B004FZWDR4,"Great series till the 2nd half. Caught it while it was airing in Japan. It has some great opening and closing themes with good action and a Conan style world. However, the 2nd half of the series just gets confusing as to what all is going on. The first follows a set storyline till completion but the 2nd picks things up after some time has passed. Likely you'd have to see the manga to figure out what is really all happening but in the anime it just ends up looking like they tried to stuff a huge chunk of the story into the 2nd half. Really Guin Saga should have been done in multiple series to get the full effect. Characters that were developed well in the start seem to suffer later as their personalities shift without much lead up. In the end it leaves you with a mildly good feeling but wishing they hadn't rushed it. Hopefully the English dub will be respectable. But I for one cannot picture anyone's voice doing Guin justice as the original Japanese.",1293667200,9,963,4.385474860335195
