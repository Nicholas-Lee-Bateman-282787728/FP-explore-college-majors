8037981,1,B00063QDBG,"$80 for a 25 minute DVD!  I wanted to get driver's ed info for my 16 year old son and this DVD was a waste of money for us!  It covers signs, lines on the road, very basic stuff. The web site only provides a very basic question test. A great dissappointment.  Maybe the DVD could be used as the first video in a driver's ed high school class.",1167436800,13,342,3.927536231884058
