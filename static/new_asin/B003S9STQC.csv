Anyway, just as she did before Suspira is marvelous at breaking movements down and explaining proper technique. She's very warm and it's easy to follow. However, this dvd does still lack in a few areas:

1) There is no warm up. She states clearly in the beginning that she expects you to already be ready and warmed up to begin safely performing the movements. Though I can see why once I move to intermediate that at that point I should know to warm myself up without needing prompting. Still, having a basic warm up would have been nice.

2) This dvd also lacks a cool down. So again it falls on you, the viewer, to find a cool down that works for you. I don't really have a huge issue but this is something that you might want to know about.

Otherwise, this is a marvelous dvd that moves at a good, slow pace for someone who is just progressing into more advanced movements. Take your time, have fun, and definitely check this dvd out!",1349136000,,1117,4.186046511627907
