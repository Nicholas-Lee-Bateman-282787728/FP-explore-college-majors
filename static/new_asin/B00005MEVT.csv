I watched this whole thing..don't know why..Anything with Joe Estevez has never been decent. The DVD's case says the film is in ""letterbox widescreen"", but in 2015, that means on most Blu-Ray players ""little pixelated rectangle in the middle of the screen"". Very sad. The box cover looks pretty good..too bad it's the only thing likable about this movie and this dvd.. ""Letterbox Widescreen Version"" - HA!",1436140800,,580,4.8686868686868685

Thanks!",1354147200,,132,4.28
7945435,5,B00005MEVT,"Just a word of interest about The Remnant. As a lifetime movie buff, the movie gave me the opportunity to be in front of the camera. I had a small part in the film, playing the caretaker. It was an exciting time. The actors and the crew were a great group of people to work with. The screen writer and I worked in radio together, Rick's brother, Matt. I hope you will have the movie in stock again soon. Thanks for this oportunity.",1100044800,,431,4.204819277108434

7945437,5,B00005MEVT,"I watched the movie ""The Remnant"" quite awhile ago but will never forget it! First of all because I believe Rick Jordan to be a very sexy hunk and just having him be  one of the main characters had me enthralled all throughour the film!!! I want him to know he is very talented and to keep making movies because I will be a fan to everyone of them!!!

7945438,5,B00005MEVT,A must see especially over the Halloween. I just finished watching the movie and found it very interesting and exciting.  The script was well written and kept you in suspense as to who or what is 'the Remnant'. Rick Jordon did a good job playing Jesse and his 'evil eyes' will pierce the soul of the  even the faint-hearted. Bravo to Iceman Productions and EBS for an entertaining couple of hours.,1004054400,2,397,4.577464788732394
7945439,4,B00005MEVT,"I just saw The Remnant today. I'm not usually a big fan of scary movies, but I am friends with the director's brother. He told me about it a while back while it was in the process of being filmed. It recently came to my local video store so I, of course, rented it. I thought it was really good...it was a good plot, easy to stay intrested in. Rick also stared in the movie. He did a great job with that, too. Very cool Rick! Very cool!",999475200,2,436,3.965909090909091
