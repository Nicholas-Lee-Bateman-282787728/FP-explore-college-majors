Imagine pre-exhausting supersets mixed with boot camp and brief cardio bursts and anit-gravity/super slow exercises all mixed together to give you one fun and tough workout! This video is a SUPER BOREDOM BUSTER DREAM. Although this is a total body workout-- this tape is the best inner thigh work I have ever done and I can still feel my sore chest muscles days later!,1044576000,6,483,4.761904761904762
1832884,5,B000089RTX,"Strong bear made working out fun again. When I was doing it I was having fun and I wasn't watching the clock to see when it would be over. The moves are innovative and exciting and there is no hint of the hum drum here.
This workout challenges each part of the body, it doesn't forget anything, even the feet get their moment to work. Inner thighs are emphasized in these videos and mine were sore for a day or two the first time I did this video.
I would definitely recommend this for the advanced exerciser. Although a beginner could use light weights if they want a VERY good challenge.",1044316800,7,589,4.315315315315315
1832885,5,B000089RTX,Anna Benson has again used her beautiful star Tracie Long to make another incredably effective and innovative exercise tape. The medicine ball makes it fun and the time flies while you sweat sweat sweat!,1043971200,,203,5.0
1832886,5,B000089RTX,This is a great workout.  You feel every muscle in your body.  You could use this tape if you were a beginner(lighten up on your weights) to advanced(heavier weights).  Tracie's form is great in all of the exercises.  The time flys by during this workout.  You will definitely never get bored.  It is a fun and different workout.  You must have it.,1043971200,,348,4.516129032258065
1832887,5,B000089RTX,"This is an excellent workout!  The moves are very challenging and Tracie Long really works the muscles with controlled movements on the ""negative"" part of the rep.  There is plenty of time for equipment changes and form pointers are offered throughout the video.  This is what many video exercisers call a ""slow and heavy"" workout.  Add it to your collection and you will see great results.",1043971200,2,390,4.863636363636363
1832888,5,B000089RTX,"Co-creator of ""The Firm"" aerobic weight training videos, Anna Benson teams up with Tracie Long, instructor extraordinaire (also of Firm fame) to create a TOUGH workout that is different and fun.
The moves are unique, but not too complex.  The workout blends  traditional weight moves (variations on squats, lunges, plies, tall box leg press, push ups, lat row, biceps curls, triceps dips, french press) with floor legs, yoga stretches and core work.
The music is terrific, motivating but unobtrusive.  Tracie's cueing is, hands down, the best and she gives plenty of direction on form.  Time flies by when I do this tape, yet it's a killer workout.  I was feeling it for days after.
For serious home exercisers, you simply cannot go wrong with anything Anna and Tracie are involved in, whether it's FitPrime or The Firm.",1043884800,13,820,4.956204379562044
1832889,5,B000089RTX,"If you've never tried Firm or FitPrime, be prepared ... this is a SERIOUS workout!  You will get great results with instructor Tracie Long, who leads viewers through a tough, 53-minute strength oriented workout with brief aerobic intervals.  Yoga and Pilates moves are also part of the mix.  I've been exercising for years, and this one made muscles sore that I didn't even know I had!  Bravo, Anna Benson, Tracie Long and everyone at FitPrime.",1043884800,7,444,4.88
7981056,5,B000089RTX,Tough workout.  You cannot go wrong with Tracie Long.,1468627200,,53,4.888888888888889
7981057,4,B000089RTX,"Strong Bear is from the original FitPrime series by Anna Benson, co-creator of The Firm workouts.  The videos in this series are known for their blend of exercise components (cardio, weights, and yoga), their often-quirky moves, and their relatively poor production values (more on this below).  In general, I really like the FitPrime workouts, as I find them to be fun and different, so I decided to give Strong Bear a try.  For this full-body weighted workout, you will need a tall box/high step and several sets of dumbbells; a balance dowel and ankle weights are optional.

Strong Bear is led by Tracie Long, who later went on to create her own video series (borrowing both some of the moves and some of the music found here).  Tracie is an excellent, no-nonsense instructor, and I found her to be even more low-key in this than in her other workouts.  Unlike most of the other FitPrimes, Strong Bear has very little cardio, although there are three separate segments which include brief plyometric jumps (plie jumps, squat jumps, and toe jumps).  Rather, the main focus here is on weight work, particularly for the lower body and even more specifically for the inner thighs.  From a standing position, Tracie does several unique twists on plie moves (eg, plies with one foot on the box) to target this area, and in addition, there is a long series of floor work focused mainly on the inner thighs.  The upper body is certainly not ignored, however:  you will do compound upper and lower body moves (eg, squats with overhead press), plus there is a really great upper body balance sequence where you stand on one leg to do military presses, french presses, and shoulder work.  Although this definitely works the core, there is not much other abs work, but the workout finishes with a nice stretch.

For the most part, I was able to match the weights that Tracie uses, but I sometimes had to go lighter than she does, especially for the compound moves.  I found Tracie's cues for push-ups with one hand on the box to be extremely helpful; this move has always confused me a bit in other videos, but Tracie provides detailed information, including showing you what NOT to do, and so I felt the exercise much more than usual.  In other places during this workout, however, I was disappointed that Tracie did not give more in depth setup instructions.  Many of the exercises in this video were new to me, and thus I would've liked greater assistance from Tracie about how I should be positioned as well as exactly where I should be feeling the work.  Finally, regarding the production values:  as with all of the older FitPrime videos, you can clearly see the editing cuts.  This did not bother me, but what WAS a bit more noticeable to me was that in a few spots, Tracie works the two sides of the body unevenly (eg, she does a final set of slow reps for one bicep but not the other).  Also, although I generally enjoy the music in the FitPrime videos, it got a little weird at times here, suddenly lapsing into a few bizarre spoken vocals.

Overall, however, I found this to be an excellent, unique strength workout.  Despite the fact that there wasn't much cardio, the relatively fast pace of the moves kept me in my target heart rate zone during most of the standing work, and I felt a nice burn in my inner thighs the next day.  Fans of Tracie's newer workouts are likely to enjoy this as well (so long as they are prepared for the lower production values).  Definitely recommended as a solid, distinctive full-body workout, with my final rating being 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1184198400,,3578,4.6176935229067935
7981058,3,B000089RTX,What can I say about this good and tough workout except for its a bit hard to look at. Tracey deserves better!!!,1116288000,,112,4.136363636363637
7981059,4,B000089RTX,"I just did this video this morning and have had it for over a year.  I rotate it in my body building program about once every two or three weeks.  I really like it because Tracie allows for you to use heavy or light weights.  If you are feeling particularly strong she goes slow enough on most of the exercises that you can use heavier weights.  I have found that a lot of her moves are unique to her old Firm videos especially using that 14 inch step.  My heart rate stayed in the fat burning zone for most of the video until the floor work section at the end.  You will work most of your body although if I think that if there is a section that is somewhat lacking it is chest work.  I mean there are some pushups but specific chest exercises are not demonstrated.  Not a big point as all other muscle groups are covered very well.
You will need a 14 inch riser or some level below that if you aren't comfortable at that height.  It's ok to start low, say at 6 inch and eventually work your way up.  If you want, you may need a mat for the pushups and doing the lying leg work.  You need a dowel for a few exercises but really you can lean against the wall and do without.
Tracie is no nonsense, effective and very clear in her instructions.  When you want to know you have worked out use this tape.",1085011200,9,1301,4.078740157480315
7981060,5,B000089RTX,"Another incredible production from Anna Benson and team. I've been a long time user of The Firm tapes, the gold standard of exercise videos, but these Fitprime surpass those in innovation and toughness. Tracie's cueing is flawless and her delivery (and body!) inspiring. This tape takes the best of plyometrics, yoga, weight training, and aerobics and incorporates it into one amazing, butt burning workout. This video was awarded Best New Fitness Video for a reason.",1071792000,11,467,5.24
7981061,5,B000089RTX,"I love all of the Firm videos, but the new FitPrime videos are fast becoming my favorites--especially Strong Bear. The moves are refreshingly different, easy to learn but challenging and fun. The inner thigh and hip work is intense (in a good way!). My non-dominant muscles love having a workout all their own! :)",1054166400,12,313,4.814814814814815
7981062,5,B000089RTX,"Anna Benson has done it again! This workout is amazing, and really does work your whole body, esp. your legs. New moves that are fun, and actually make you smile while doing them! Tracie Long is a personal favorite, and her cuing is probably the best yet! The background is better than ever, not as cluttered as in the past. No ball, which some will love, and Tracie tells you exactly which poundage she is using. I highly recommend this to anyone with a FIRM/FitPrime background. Newbies will need to lower poundage, it is tough!",1046131200,11,530,4.589473684210526
7981063,5,B000089RTX,"This is a wonderful workout with one of the best instructors out there.  Please don't let the ... price put you off this purchase.  Yes, I know it is more expensive than the average workout video.  However, the old adage goes that you get what you pay for and that is no more true than in the case of ""Strong Bear""  This is worth every penny.  ... I have done this workout three times, and I am already seeing definition where none previously existed.  Tracie's cueing is, as always, superb.  The music is excellent and unique.  Anna Benson is a creative genius when it comes to workout videos, and this is one of her most superlative efforts to date.  You will NOT be disappointed with this purchase.",1045612800,15,701,4.456692913385827
7981064,5,B000089RTX,"This tape is so much fun, the time just flies by when I'm doing it.  It has lots of new fun and different moves.  It works the whole body in new and different ways.  Anna Benson and Tracie Long are great for coming up with unique and fun ways to work out, and Tracie is always a pleasure to work out with.  This tape is also very challenging - especially for the inner thighs and triceps!",1044576000,2,388,4.065789473684211
7981065,4,B000089RTX,"This video has alot of inner thigh work, but not enough ab or corework. Even with very heavy weights, it is not too challenging. The video production quality is poor, but the music is above average. Tracie Long is a great instructor, her cueing is wonderful. Strong Bear is different and fun. I will reach for this video when I need a relaxing weight workout. It's a keeper.",1044576000,6,374,4.514705882352941
