I lent the tape to my friend, after his divorce, and he thanked me for it, saying it helped.",1383609600,,257,4.733333333333333
7798605,5,1573880485,"I do not have this book, but would like to. Bradshaw is a season priest who is a recovering alcoholic who works with the child within and I would imagine that this would help all of at any age go through the pain of divorce.",1374451200,,224,4.0
7798606,5,1573880485,"Today, as I am sending the link to this video to a dear friend who may or may not be divorcing, I remember how much this video helped me in the years after my divorce some years ago.  I have often thought that this video should be renamed -- because I wish I had seen it BEFORE I married my ex-husband, for I would not have married him!
Most of all, what I learned from Bradshaw's heartfelt video was to take time to heal, and that is what I have done --given myself plenty of time to heal.  Marriage is like a living death, and even moreso when you have been under years and years of immense professional and personal stress, as I had been before my marriage blew up.  This is why videotapes like Bradshaw's are timeless and soothing.  I recommend it highly!  :-)",1059782400,2,764,4.241379310344827
7798607,5,1573880485,"Excellent!  I am a marriage and family counselor who has used this video extensively with my clients trying to recover from divorce.  Bradshaw gives many excellent coping tools, and actions to take in his thoughtful  presentation of the this subject matter.  He assists the reader by easing  their pain, and gives them directions on how to move on with their lives.  I highly recommend this video",961027200,,396,4.924242424242424
