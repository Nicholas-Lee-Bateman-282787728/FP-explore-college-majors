8735064,5,B015XSIEJC,"Love this!!!! I got a Region 2 player, just for my British programs that I can't find on Region 1 DVDs. This show is just sooooo funny!!!!  Miranda Hart is brilliant, and such a great physical comedian, and the other characters on the show are also very well done.",1531440000,,264,4.387755102040816
8735065,5,B015XSIEJC,"Wonderful series!
Just remember this needs a region-free player.",1516665600,,64,6.222222222222222
8735066,5,B015XSIEJC,"The entire ""Miranda"" series in one box.  Perfect.  Bought a Multi Region DVD just so I could play this show.  Great seller too, shipped it instantly and it arrived in less than a week!",1515369600,3,184,4.352941176470588
8735067,5,B015XSIEJC,"I, too, bought a zone free DVD player just for this series. It is absolutely what I call hysterical. Such fun!!",1510704000,6,111,4.333333333333333
8735068,5,B015XSIEJC,"We need US compatible dvds....Please.  This show is brilliant.  Oddly, the best shows are authentic reflections of the free spirit we all remember but have forgotten how to be.  It is sanity which is nonsensical, paradoxical and contradictory.  Insanity is logical, rational, defensive and self justified.
This is the quirky greatness of Miranda Hart -",1507248000,8,352,5.345454545454546
8735069,5,B015XSIEJC,"How I wish Miranda would bring back one of the best comedy shows ever.  She was fabulous and so were the people
who made up her cast.
Miranda, if you are seeing this, PLEASE REPRISE YOUR HISTERICAL SHOW.  I can't speak highly enough the
laughter my husband and I have enjoyed.
YOU ARE THE BEST.
Thank You For These Few Short Years.

8735070,5,B015XSIEJC,LOVE LOVE LOVE this show. Ordered an all region DVD player so I could get this DVD series. THAT is how much I adore it!,1493251200,6,119,3.8
8735071,5,B015XSIEJC,"I really like this quirky, witty, sometimes silly, comedy centered on a slightly odd misfit -but lovable- character and her equally whacky friends and family.

When I first saw on the TV a few years ago, it took me a few episodes to warm to it, but it gets better and better as it goes along. While there may be an occasional ""naughty"" reference or typical British double-entendre, this show does not rely on vulgarity for its laughs, which is a nice change.

I was very pleased to find this set that contained all 3 series plus the finale, all in one, and at a much more reasonable price than buying them separately. (I paid less than $30 when ordered in November 2016.)

Note this is REGION 2 (UK) DVD set. You need a multi region player if you are in North America.",1484611200,5,768,4.356643356643357
