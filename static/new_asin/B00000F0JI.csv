8279932,2,B00000F0JI,"Even though there is no question on what David Leadbetter's has contributed to the world of golf, the Vol. 1 and 2 of this video really aren't much what you would expect.

First of all, the sound is awful, many dialogs are lost because the sound of the wind hitting the microphone.  Also, the editing is poor.

The drills presented on the video are not bad, but Nick Price, who is the co-star of the video, makes a superfast backswing, not easy to follow for someone trying to copy a movement or correct a mistake.

Considering the poor quality of the video and the hard to follow movements, this is not a video that would be much of an advantage for a golf enthusiast trying to improve his swing.
