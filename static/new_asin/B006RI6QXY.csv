According with my heart rate monitor I burned almost 700 calorie.",1423267200,,562,4.744897959183674
8503588,5,B006RI6QXY,"I did this workout yesterday for the first time... I am sore in muscles that haven't been sore in a long time! I am an extreme exercise enthusist that lives for hardcore workouts. This workout does it!! I found everything about this workout INTENSE!  I workout daily for at least 2 hours a day, so with that said, this is not a beginner workout. I would recommend this to people who have been working out consistently, and past the beginner stage.",1391299200,,447,4.518518518518518
