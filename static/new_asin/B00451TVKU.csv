8416447,5,B00451TVKU,"I gave this product a five star rating,becuase of Dio's recent passing. I did have one problem that the item I received seemed to skip in about three places,but I think that was a recording issue not a production problem.",1403308800,,221,4.55
8416448,3,B00451TVKU,"This DVD is good for the collection! only if your a real DIO Fan! Thats mean you really don't care if the sound is bad, if the DVD quality is bad or if someone's grandmother with parkinson's  disease was taking care of the camera!",1353888000,9,230,4.2272727272727275
8416449,3,B00451TVKU,"This is a great concert from the Sacred Heart tour.  But this DVD is only half of the performance.  The packaging says 60 minutes but sadly its only 30 minutes long.  And the video quality is not any better than the old 60 minute bootleg.  So nice try at an official release, but way short of its potential.",1300233600,2,307,4.241379310344827
