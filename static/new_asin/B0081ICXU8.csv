It's not for the faint of heart.  If you're willing to work hard, you will see changes.  I do the workouts three times a week.",1350518400,4,271,3.8545454545454545
8523958,4,B0081ICXU8,"I have over 300 workout DVDs in my collection and consider myself to be an advanced exerciser -- but this is one tough workout!  I did it for the first time yesterday, and I'd say that it's one of the hardest out of all the DVDs I own.

It's a lot of fun to do if you like to be challenged, but if you don't have good core strength (which I don't), you might need to build up to this one.  It's also pretty hard on the wrists since you're doing so much plank work.  I woke up today incredibly sore in places I've never been sore before!  Yikes!  My whole ab area aches, but in a good way since I know that the exercises really got into some spots that I need to target.

To do this workout, you'll need:

*  a step with one riser on each side
*  a yoga mat
*  Gliding disks or towels

It's broken down into segments where you cycle through two exercises, twice each.  For instance, you'll do Exercise 1, then Exercise 2, then 1, then 2.  After that, you'll take a short break before moving on to the next set.

Most of the exercise pairs include some form of using the Gliding Disks to do plank-style moves.  Since these moves require a lot of core strength, I felt a bit frustrated at times since there was no way to modify the moves by going onto your knees. (For example, she has you do walking planks, with your feet on the Disks.  You move forward across the floor, and then move back.  I tried going down to my knees, but it was very uncomfortable to have the Disks under my knees.) Instead, I had to do something different or take a lot of breaks.

That being said, this was still a fun workout, and I'm really hoping that by doing it once a week, I can build up my core strength to be able to do all of it.  Sandra's personality is pleasant and sweet, and she's very encouraging.  Just be willing to eat a little humble pie -- as I sure did! -- if you lack the core and arm strength to do lots of full-body planks.",1344902400,4,1922,4.058510638297872
