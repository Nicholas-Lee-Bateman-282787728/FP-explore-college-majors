It may make someone feel that they are understanding something about geometry when, in fact, it is ""easy to understand"" because the information is not correct. I had purchased this to use in class in case I could not be there and had a substitute. I could never use such a poor video in a class. Don't waste your money on this. Buy Donald in Mathmagicland instead. It is far superior and easy to understand and completely accurate.",1220400000,2,518,4.641304347826087
