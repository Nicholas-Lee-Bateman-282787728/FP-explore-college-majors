3854303,4,B0026LYMG4,I saw this movie when I was pre-teen and it seemed to be well made movie and I did like it..  I am waiting for the movie to arrive from Amazon so I can give a better review.  Enjoy. :),1255737600,,184,3.575
3854304,4,B0026LYMG4,"We Italian film fanatics can all thank Quinten Tarantino and his new Film ""Inglourious Basterds"" for companies finally releasing some high quality ""Macaroni Combat"" films on DVD. First we Got Wild East's release of ""Churchill's Leopards"" & ""Salt in the Wound"" double feature, then we got Dark Sky's release of ""The Last Hunter"". FINALLY we got Severin's release of ""The Inglorious Bastards"". Now Severin graciously releases yet another ""Macaroni Combat"" classic with ""Eagles Over London"".

Directed by perhaps Italy's best action director Enzo G. Castillari, ""Eagles Over London""  came very early on in the ""Macaroni Combat"" cycle being released in 1969. Right off the bat people are going to compare this film to his nine year later classic ""Inglorious Bastards"" and I will admit this film isn't as over-the-top or as fun as that film. It however is a very entertaining  Italian cult flick.

The film surprisingly has very strong production values for an Italian film at the time. Most Italian films have very low budgets but this seems to be an exception. It comes nowhere near the look of big budget Hollywood WWII films at the time, and people shouldn't expect it to be, but for an Italian film this is pretty big and epic.

The plot is standard with British military officers a in pursuit of a merciless team of Nazi saboteurs though war-ravaged London. Throughout it all there is plenty of violence and cool camera work to appease all the Euro cult fanatics out there. The aerial combat sequences do look fake but then again it really looks no worse than Britain's 1969 big budget epic The Battle of Britain.

Overall I found this to be a very entertaining Euro cult film by one of Italy's great directors. Some of the dubbing is unintentionally funny but we fans come to expect that. People who can only  watch high budget Hollywood WWII epics are most likely going to hate this film but this DVD is a must buy for Euro cult enthusiasts.

Severin does another A+ job with this DVD release. We get a great widescreen transfer and another interview with Enzo and Quinten.",1254096000,10,2076,4.811797752808989
3854305,1,B0026LYMG4,"I have been a fan of WW2 movies all my life.  This movie should have been bombed in the ""BLITZ"". It is truly terrible. From the poorly written story line, through the inept acting, misbegotten editing, cheap cinematography and cheap set dressing, and oh, did I mention one of the five WORST WW2 movies of all time.  Wait for the ""INGLORIOUS BASTERDS"", that's a REAL MOVIE!!!!",1251072000,3,375,4.666666666666667

3854311,2,B0026LYMG4,"Historical accurate or not doesn't matter for me. I was interested seeing Van Johnson, Frederic Stafford who are the two international stars of this italian made (original title: ""La battaglia d'Inghilterra"") War Movie and directed by Enzo G. Castellari (Quentin Tarentino is his biggest fan).

It was one of the biggest italian war movies at this time and of course, the special effects are (for today) not perfect and you can clearly see some ""split screen"" scenes. But I don't care about and you should also not (because the movie was made in 1969 and they never had a big budget like US movies).

This Blu-Ray is Codefree.
Subtitels available: NONE

Bonus-Features:
- the 2nd part of a Interview of Quentin Tarantino with Enzo G. Castellari (""Inglorious Bastards""): 1080p, Dolby Digital 2.0, 14:15 min

The Picture Quality is not very good all. For a  DVD it might by ok but for a Blu-Ray? It says on the back Cover ""restored"". I really have expected a better quality. Its just to corny and the black contrast isn't that good.

Also dissapointed that the Blu-Ray doesn't have any subtitles.",1388707200,,1223,4.827751196172249
3854312,2,B0026LYMG4,"I have to say this movie is the strangest classic WWII movie I ever encountered. I think the story was okay but the hardware especially the combat scene is really awkward. HA1112 as spitfire and spitfire act as Me109s? I can hardly tell which side their on. It seems like a large budget movie, but I will not recommend this movie to any historic aviation fans. Stick with Battle of Britain if you want history.",1366156800,,410,4.48

3854316,1,B0026LYMG4,"I gave it one star only because I had to.  An Italian spaghetti director, British generals with, yep, Italian accents, histrionic battle choreography, model bridges being blown up, rocket and shell strikes so fake you can actually see the flour explode, out of sync audio, great views of Italian, strike that, British country vistas, bright red (sure) ""British"" convertibles, a bridge visible in the English Channel at ""Dunkirk"" and, believe it or not, even worse acting.  Script?  Written by 4th grade Italian immigrants.

Just shake your head and enjoy - or not.",1259539200,5,564,5.0978260869565215

8353043,1,B0026LYMG4,Probably the worst war movie ever produced.  The equipment show was not of the period and very fakey.  Scenes were drawn out and slow moving.  Editing was bad.  It probably made no money and  the price to rent is way too high.  If I payed even $0.99 It would not be woth the price.  Van Johnson a pain to watch.,1453939200,,311,4.083333333333333
