3155224,5,B0016AU86E,"This DVD was both funny and clean. These days that is a difficult combination to find, but mandatory if it is going to find it's way into my house. Anita Renfroe is very real and makes you laugh because you can relate. This is a great pick-me-up for just about any woman. Go ahead buy the DVD and laugh. Pass it on and keep the laughter going! It is contagious and we need more laughter.",1239667200,,387,4.173333333333333

I have enjoyed some of her songs, but she sings a little too much for my taste.  I would prefer to just hear the stand up.  However, I keep buying them because they make me laugh.  I am also enjoying her book The Purse-driven Life: It Really Is All About Me.  Very funny and hard to put down.",1230854400,,432,4.011764705882353

3155235,4,B0016AU86E,"Definitely one of Anita Renfrow's best! Funny, touching, Christ centered. An extraordinarily talented vocalist, musician, comedienne. She puts life in perspective.",1361577600,,163,6.809523809523809
3155236,3,B0016AU86E,not her best. glad i bought it used and didn't pay full price.  it seems like she doesn't mention anything about God until the very end of her programs and i doesn't seem to fit with the overall theme.,1355443200,,201,4.153846153846154
3155237,5,B0016AU86E,"There is so much humor Anita finds in women's lives. I love it that she can make us laugh and she never does so at the expense of others.  She doesn't hurt feelings or mock or say maliciously ""funny"" things. She does not ""bash"" men as so many female comediennes do.  I love it that Anita ends her comedy with loving Christian outreach.",1355356800,,335,4.301587301587301

3155241,5,B0016AU86E,"Ok, I saw Anita Renfroe live at Women of Faith: Over the Top this year.  She is a riot!!

She is very random. She talks and has parts of a conversation, and then quickly changes to another topic (Very female)  She is a mix of stand up and musical comedy.

A humourous explanation about the Thyroid tells how it works, and some of the problems that the thyroid causes.

The DVD line up:

*What I'm Talking About
*LASIK and Hi Def
*Dadsense
*Creative Memories
*Lay a Little Snare for You
*It's Probably Just my Thyroid
*Before I Eat
*Grocery Store Games
*Magazines and Catalogs
*Letter to My Younger Self
*I Sing for Them
I loved this video!! I did also see ""Two Thumbs Up"" and it was cute, and humorous to see the changes Anita made through the years (Greatest songs - so far) type of video.

If you've ever watched Banana's comedy, they will sometimes pick on people just to get a laugh.  Anita doesn't do that (although she did call Creative Memories a cult  )  So it's refreshing to have comedy that laughs at the difficulties of being female

 It's Probably Just My Thyroid is a DVD I would recommend to any woman (and her man) who wants a laugh!! Clean and Fun!!

* Note: This video review is my own opinion and should be taken as such.  I have not been paid to write this review, I just love laughing at her, so you might as well check it out too.  . .  Oh, and don't forget to moisturizer your neck!!
