8414978,2,B0043HMSX8,"A missionary's widow hooks up with an American crook in 19th century London and before long she's willing to go along with his scheme to blackmail her friend's husband. Needless to say, things don't go exactly according to plan. Sounds intriguing? I thought so. Alas, it's a slow, dull, and unconvincing slog filmed with all the visual flatness of an old soap opera. Not only do things take forever to get going, but I don't buy the main characters who swing wildly from debauchery to virtue at the screenwriter's whim. One moment a character is a total narcissist and sociopath and then suddenly he or she is goodness itself. And did I mention it's slow? Trust me, ""Rebecca"" and ""Gaslight"" this is not.",1526083200,,703,4.723577235772358

8414980,4,B0043HMSX8,"It was better than average but I expected it to be a little more intriguing and suspenseful. The acting was good just wish it had a little more edge of your seat moments that fit the title of the movie. Still, it was pretty good.",1495324800,,229,4.111111111111111
8414981,4,B0043HMSX8,"I very much enjoyed this noir melodrama, with a top-flight British cast who turned in superb performances.  Ann Todd is masterful in the starring role: she plays a dramatic, intense character in a restrained, subtle way that was totally truthful.  So, too, Geraldine Fitzgerald realizes her character--a vibrant, emotional woman whose childlike naievete makes her vulnerable--perfectly.  The director--clearly at the top of his game--brought out the best in his cast, which  included Ray Milland and Leo G. Carroll.

The fact that the film is based on a true story involving passionate love, murder, betrayal, and good struggling against evil makes for one heck of a night's entertainment.",1399507200,3,689,5.401869158878505

8414983,3,B0043HMSX8,"I saw this movie on TV one night and LOVED it! I searched every where for it on DVD and the only place I found it was on Amazon. It shipped quickly and although you can tell it was some kind of bootleg or burned from somewhere (which is expected for movies this old and generally unheard of), quality wasn't an issue. It's a black and white movie so it's understandably a bit grainy, but here's the kicker...

IT WOULDN'T PLAY THE LAST 2 MINUTES!

Anyone who has seen this movie knows how important these few minutes are and for them to be missing, or scratched off was definitely a deal breaker.",1328227200,7,596,4.3125
8414984,5,B0043HMSX8,"Very cleverly Milland charms a missionary's unhappy widow.  At first you think of him as just a rough guy, not necessarily a bad one.  I was quite surprised how fiendish he becomes.  A second watching was even more terrifying for me than the first.",1289692800,7,248,4.590909090909091
