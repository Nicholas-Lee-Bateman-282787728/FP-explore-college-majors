200758,1,159668691X,"Paid six bucks for this turkey at the used book store and wanted my money back.  I found myself wanting him to SHUT UP and draw. He talks and talks and talks instead of demonstrating. The camera focuses on a side view of him talking and swiping at the board, instead of showing the board and the model so you can see the concepts take shape.  The pencils he uses are so light that you can't see the lines.

This was a complete waste of money, you'll find better instructional videos on You Tube.",1425427200,2,495,4.24468085106383

7799747,5,159668691X,"Dan is one of the greatest living master draftsmen of our time, bar none.  Many times I fantasize about what it would be like to witness an old master draftsman drawing after the live model.  This video gives us an opportunity to do just that!  Its very rare when we can see an artist of Dans caliber not only masterfully demonstrate a drawing from life but articulate so precisely his thought process while working.  I found this video to be both enlightening and educational.  Anyone serious about the art of drawing must have this video in his or her collection.",1481414400,,565,4.61
7799748,5,159668691X,"Dan Thompson is an excellent, passionate and gifted teacher who brings to the table his studies of great art  and a long line great art teachers. He is on the faculty at the Art Student's League in NY as well as Studio Incamminati in Philadelphia. He articulately explains how to achieve more accurate drawings.

If you watch this video and PRACTICE his methods you will learn how to incorporate the model's action and vitality within the pose in your drawing. The pose's action provides the dynamism that makes effective drawing so enticing to the viewer. Watching this video is the next best thing to being in one of his classes or workshops.

Practice, Practice, Practice! Practice sessions work even better if you work with one or more other students and you (gently) critique each other's work. The objective is simply to point out where the drawing has varied from the angles and direction of the pose. Highly recommended!",1481328000,,928,4.860759493670886
