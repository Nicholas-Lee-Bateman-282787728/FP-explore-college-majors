I would like to buy a copy with English subtitles or dubbed in English, if available, and I will pay ANY price. $$$",1484697600,,251,4.208333333333333

8099647,4,B000CNGCM0,"Excellent quality DVDs.
I enjoyed the story plot,  the girl star is very beautiful and the photography of the Brazilian county and houses are spectacular.
When I ordered this I knew that it was in Portuguese but I assumed there would be an option to do English subtitles.
I haven't found a way in the menus to do that.
So I watched the whole hours long series without understanding a word they said, but still enjoyed it.",1387843200,2,421,4.467532467532467
8099648,4,B000CNGCM0,"This was a great film, though I caution those who are sensitive to nudity. Like most Brazilian shows there's some, this one has more than typical. Though the reason becomes obvious as you watch. Great story and it keeps moving. Once again, another film with parts cut out to shorten it... worth getting if you like tragic love stories!",1369440000,2,335,4.694915254237288
