596381,5,6303202039,"There is much praise heaped upon Mizoguchi Kenji's ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" including the box cover calling it ""one of the finest films ever made.""  I probably wouldn't go that far, but it is an excellent movie ranking amongst the best of the genre, standing tall with Kurosawa Akira films such as ""Red Beard.""  It is very heavy, with a strong message.
Like Kurosawa, social responsibility is a strong theme in Mizoguchi's works. In ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" we see a blending of the social classes, as an honest aristocrat is exiled, his wife sold to a brothel and his children made slaves, all because the aristocrat believed peasants deserved happiness as well, and that the aristocratic class had responsibilities to the peasants.  Mixed together, you see cruelty and mercy amongst both classes, from the tyrannical Sansho and his friendly son Taro, or the martyred slave Namiji and the cruel Zushio willing to brand another slave on the head with a hot iron.
To this there is the message of mercy.  ""Be hard on yourself, but merciful to others"" is the mantra passed from parent to child.  A sacred image of Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy, is a family heirloom, passed down from generations as a reminder.
As in all Mizoguchi's films, it is ultimately the women who suffer, bearing the sins of men on their capable shoulders.  Mizoguchi is considered a feminist in Japan, although the standards are different and most Americans would probably not consider ""Sansho the Bailiff"" a feminist film.",1089590400,13,1488,4.908366533864542

It beat out such classics as Godard's 'A Bout de Souffle', Truffaut's 'Tirez sur le  Pianiste', Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Malle's 'Zazie dans le Metro', Ray's  'Party Girl', Losey's 'Time Without Pity', Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita', and  Mankiewicz's 'Suddenly Last Summer' among others.",945820800,14,404,5.184615384615385
596459,4,6303202039,"A photoplay version of an ancient folk tale from when commercial slavery was an important contributor to regional Japanese economies (the so-called ""Dark Ages"" of some 1,200 years ago).  The tale is tied to an estate manager/overseer (or ""bailiff"") by the name of ""Sansho.""  The estate is based on slave labor and Sansho is the slave master with life and death power (but torture rather than death is preferred by Sansho as a cost inhibitor).  The traditional tale title is used by the director, but the film is not focused on the bailiff character (who plays a de facto supporting role).  Direction and cinematography (black and white) are outstanding and seem ""joined at the hip"" (although the old narrow-screen format is present on the DVD version).  Acting is a bit uneven with the adult lead actor (Yoshiaki Hanayagi) tending to overact for the camera (as if in a silent movie or on the stage).  Period costumes and mannerism (such as the staging of court protocols and processions) look authentic (judging from other source materials) and the sets are most impressive.  The film score is a major contributor to the style and enjoyment of this movie.  It is one of the best (it not the best) composed for any Japanese movie from the 20th Century.  Solos of traditional instruments are seamless interwoven into modern orchestral arrangements.  Leif motifs and themes are used for characters and scenes/locations.  The score provides the acoustical glue that helps to hold this movie together and is one of the two contributors to the film's most impressive dynamics (the other contributor being camera movements).  Highly recommended!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1413072000,,1662,5.0661764705882355

596461,3,6303202039,"This movie is rated higher than any other Japanese movie on Amazon, but during and after watching it I could not help but feel deceived because instead of the development of the key character the screenplay presents us a series of abrupt, instant changes in his personality which happen too unrealistically to be believable. In the beginning of this movie we see a boy of about 12 from a well to do family who is being parted from his father, but at the last moment receives the teaching from him: to always care for the needs and well being of others before oneself. Then we briefly see the hardships that this boy and his sister endure after they're enslaved due to a certain misfortune. Then the film jumps 10 years ahead and we see that this boy, contrary to his father's teaching, became in his slavery condition a complete brute: very harsh in his actions and speech, very irritable, nervous, uncaring for his sister and others, and several vivid scenes are consequently presented to demonstrate just how truly bad and miserable has he become. And then, during a twenty second scene where he just slightly touches on his past memory, he suddenly changes and all of a sudden becomes a good guy, although still displaying the poor slave in his speech and body manners.

Right after this scene he escapes from slavery and after meeting his late father's well wisher he is suddenly made a big governor. I mean this whole scene is also completely unbelievable, when you see how this high ranked and profound ruler making a petty beggar a governor just like that. Not just helping him in some other way or maybe offering training or something else, but giving right away a super high and responsible post to the one who (unlike Spartacus for instance) grew up as a slave and so speaks and behaves like a slave. The high official thus puts his own position in high risk of course if that guy fails, and it seems absolutely undoubtful that he should fail, and still the movie provides no reason why he is made a governor, it happens just like in children's fairy tale where a peasant is made a prince just by a king's whim. But this movie is a drama, not a fairy tale genre, and thus such unbelievable actions look just too weird, a definite shortcoming of the script.

And in the next scene, which supposedly happens just a few days later, we see this guy, just a week ago a boor, not only dressed and addressed as a governor, but also having all of a sudden all the proper manners of a governor: his speech, his posture and the way he looks and gracefully moves in that complicated governor's clothes - a completely refined person you'd say, in just few days!

And then again just a week later he resigns from his governor's post, again becomes a tramp and simultaneously starts not only to speak and walk, but also to completely look like he was before becoming a governor. This makes the whole film quite disjointed and unbelievable.

If you're interested in medieval Japan and in B&W Japanese cinema, I'd suggest to watch ""Rashomon"" and ""Seven Samurai"" instead. Both by Akira Kurosava.",1398124800,6,3088,4.609090909090909
596462,4,6303202039,"This director is not afraid of the dark side of a story. Very sad, gets sadder as it progresses. Also rather beautiful.",1371945600,,119,4.454545454545454
596463,5,6303202039,"A Nikkatsu silent film star turned director, Kenji Mizoguchi similar to Japanese filmmakers such as Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, having directed many films and in his 86-film oeuvre, a number of masterpiece films that he will forever be remembered for.

As Kurosawa was known for samurai films and Ozu for family films, Mizoguchi was known for creating films that showcase the suffering of women or women sacrificing their lives for the man they care about, may it be lover or a family member.

Best known for films such as ""The Life of Oharu"" (1952) and his Silver Lion Award (Venice Film Festival) winning film ""Ugetsu"" (1953), ""Sansho the Bailiff"" is a jidai-geki masterpiece by Mizoguchi in which his trademark interest in freedom, poverty and the suffering of women can be seen.

Each of the three films mentioned were top award winning films at the Venice Film Festival, ""Sansho the Bailiff"" would receive international acclaim and to this day, continues to receive positive reviews from film critics.  Beautifully shot by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, this heartbreaking, wonderful film will receive its debut in HD in America on Blu-ray courtesy of the Criterion Collection.

VIDEO:

""Sansho the Bailiff"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio).  The film features wonderful contrast and is well-detailed even compared to its 2007 Criterion Collection DVD counterpart.  Whites and grays are well-contrast, black levels are also much better. But the cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa is artistic and if anything, there are so many memorable scenes in this film.  And it's great to see a version of the film that looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  I saw no damage or flickering, if anything, the film looks magnificent on Blu-ray!

JUDGMENT CALL:

No director likes to be pigeon-holed with making films of a certain commonality bu for filmmaker Kenji Mizoguchi, directing films that dealt with the suffering or sacrifice of a woman is what he would be known for.

Having grown up in poverty as his mother tried to raise the family, his older sister becoming a geisha to help the family and even during the silent era, as an actor playing female roles, Mizoguchi was probably deeply influenced by this.

And thus, his willingness to capture the emotion, the pain of a woman's suffering as seen in ""Sansho the Bailiff"".

Unlike any film that you will see from other notable filmmakers of Mizoguchi's time, such as Kurosawa and Ozu, this 1954 film showed audiences another side to Japanese cinema.  One that is not about the morality or honor of society, nor was this a film about the modern family and family dynamics, this was a film about a family being torn apart by rampant slave trading and prostitution.

The first time I watched this film, it was so profound and heartbreaking.  Never in my life, considering I have studied Japanese, did I ever know about slavery in Japan.  Where anyone was fair game to be captured and sold to work for slave estates without pay and were more or less treated like animals.  Kenji Mizoguchi's film not only exposed me to this but he makes one feel the emotional impact by capturing the sadness, the torment and the emotion of frustration, sadness, fear all in this film, while showing a glimpse of potential hope.

Mizoguchi's muse, Kinuyo Tanaka, may not be the primary character of  the film but each film I have saw the actress, she manages to captivate the screen with immense efficacy.  From her role as Orin in Keisuke Kinoshita's 1958 film ""Ballad of Narayama"" to her role in ""The Life of Oharu"" (1952) and ""Ugetsu"" (1953), she gives commanding performances.  With ""Sansho the Bailiff"", it's her screams of ""Zushio"" or ""Anju"" that stings you to your core.  A woman who would do anything to find her children but each time, she is captured, tortured, defeated.

As a viewer or even a parent, you can't help but feel the pain of a mother who desperately wants to be their for her children.

Meanwhile, you watch as her two children are forced to pitiful conditions as slaves and to see them ten years later as Anju manages to keep her promise to her father by remaining compassionate, while Zushio is lost.  Feeling that they are stuck and will remain as slaves as one man, who has been a slave for 50-years, must be branded on the forehead for trying to escape.

Both Yoshiaki Hanayagi and Kyoko Kagawa give awesome performances, and while we do not see so much of Hanayagi in the future, we do see Kagawa again in Akira Kurosawa's wonderful ransom film ""Tengoku to Jigoku"" (High and Low) and decades later in the 1993 Kurosawa film ""Madadayo"".

And in balance with the wonderful acting in the film is also the amazing cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa coordinated with the aesthetics that were planned by Mizoguchi.  May it be an opening shot of the family walking together to visit their father or Tamaki on top of a cliff yelling her children's name or even a scene featuring Anju walking toward a lake, this film is beautiful and memorable!

As for the Blu-ray release, many will wonder if it's worth the upgrade to Blu-ray as the original Criterion Collection 2007 DVD also had the fantastic booklet and special features that are featured on the 2013 Blu-ray release.  My opinion is that if you want the definitive version of this film, then owning it on Blu-ray for the better picture and audio quality should be enough to convince one to upgrade to the HD version of Mizoguchi's masterpiece.

The detail is so much better that you can see objects with much more clarity over its 2007 DVD counterpart.  Yes, it's definitely worth the upgrade!

Overall, ""Sansho the Bailiff"" is among the Japanese masterpiece that cineaste should own in their collection.  It's a tremendous film that captures a wide range of emotions, stellar acting, wonderful direction and cinematography a heartbreaking storyline that still manages to give viewers hope.  If you are curious about Kenji Mizoguchi or a cinema fan who is starting to get into Japanese cinema, make sure that ""Sansho the Bailiff"" is on top of your want list, because it is a must own title!

596466,5,6303202039,"Picture this scene:  A lord from the Imperial Dynasty arrives at Sansho the Bailiff's huge estate.  He is pleased that the slave owner Sansho is forcing the correct amount of taxes from the people and is even more delighted when Sansho delivers a chest of treasure as a special gift for the lord.  The lord advises the son of Sansho the Bailiff that, as a son, he must be very proud to have such a good father. The truth is the son winces because he's appalled at all the pain his father  inflicts on weak people to deliver the treasure and taxes. [Sansho even carries a stick that looks like the devil's pitchfork]. That story is still relevant...today.  Consider a pioneer praised by almost everyone - ""Steve Jobs"".  Despite his genius, we know that he approved of Apple Computers' use of very cheap labor from China - almost slave labor - to make the technology products. Just as bad, when those products are recycled, some of the unfortunates extracting the raw materials in 3rd world countries will die from the toxic chemicals used in the manufacture. Does Steve Jobs really deserve all his honor? One report puts it thusly: (As recently as 10 years ago Apple's computers were assembled in the United States, but today they are built in southern China under appalling labor conditions. Apple, like the vast majority of the electronics industry, skirts labor laws by subcontracting all its manufacturing to companies like Foxconn, a firm made infamous for suicides at its plants, a worker dying after working a 34-hour shift, widespread beatings, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to meet high quotas set by tech companies like Apple)

This movie brings all these moral elements to the forefront.

As the other reviewers will mention, the story depicted in the film is really about a brother and sister enslaved to Sansho the Bailiff. These siblings are named Zushio and Anzu. Their terrible fate is brought about because their father was exiled for protesting unfair conditions for peasants and their mother was taken away as a slave prostitute.

During his slave life, Zushio comes to think that the best way to prosper is to do what his evil master bids him - no matter how horrible; in contrast, his sister continues to live a compassionate life.  Only later will Zushio reconsider his deeds of injustice.  But first his sister will sacrifice her own life so that her brother may flee the slavery.

Not only does this film make you think - all the time - but ironically it is one of the most gorgeously made black & white films in the pantheon of such movies.  I am sending it as a gift to every teenager I know.  I choose to give it as a gift to teach the young about the values of nonviolence and kindness and to oppose the Hollywood attitude of overtly or secretly worshiping killing.

One fascinating aspect of the cinematography of ""Sansho the Bailiff"" is that the director often shoots the beginning and middle of a scene of violence - then lets the viewer fill in the details in his or her mind.  I will offer one example: When bandits seize Zushio's mother and set her into a canoe, they also kidnap her woman servant. These brave women fight the men in the boat as best as they can; in the conflict, the good servant is thrown into the lake. Alas, she cannot swim. After a few strong ripples, the scene changes.  Her final death gasps and drowning are not revealed. Is it really necessary?  That technique is used over and over...it forces us to use our imagination to comprehend the violence without overwhelming us with horror and gore.

Another approach to the cinema is that director Mizoguchi adopts a world view where the lines between people and nature overlap  - Zushio's mother lives on a barren island which seems part of the enveloping sea and sky.

This is a film that reaches deep and shakes our soul. Harrowing, sad, but noble.  I think of it as one of the must-see masterpieces of its kind.",1362787200,,3931,4.6502890173410405
596467,5,6303202039,"A moving, stirring film based on a folk tale from the Heian Period of Japan around the 12th - 13th century.  Sansho the Baliff or Sansho Dayu is about a lord who is punished for believing that all men are created equal and exiled to a far away province.  HIs wife and children are given to his brother to care for.  After several years, the mother decides to travel to the province where the father is exiled and takes a servant and her two children with her.  On the way, the family is fooled by a kind woman who puts the family up for a night but then talks them into a taking a boat instead of walking to their destination.  This turns out to be a ruse however, the mother and female servant are kidnapped and taken to an island for prostitution and the children are sold to a manor belonging to the title character, Sansho the bailiff.  The kids survive on menial labor and witness the punishment and branding of slaves who run away.  The mother is constantly running away from her brothel and has her leg cut off as punishment.  Years later the boy, now a man tries to end slavery and bring his family together.  Kenji Mizoguchi is one of my favorite directors.  He was able to tell a beautiful tale and his photography on his films is quite elegant.  Along with the film, the commentary by Jeffery Angles is well worth listening to and seems to understand Japanese language and history quite well.

596490,5,6303202039,"After having just viewed a Japanese film ranked as ""One of the top 10 films of our time,"" and finding it to be, in my estimation, excellent, but not deserving of a higher ranking, I decided to view Sancho the Bailiff, as it was in my collection of unwatched films, really just to get it out of the way.

Boy, was I knocked out of my recliner chair readily enough as the movie kept progressing to spellbinding and profound proportions.

I found myself truly watching, not only one of the best 10 films ever made, but one of the best, in my estimation, top 2 films ever made, the only comparison I can make being of that with Grand Illusion.  The two are equal in superb quality in every possible way.

By the way, I rank as number 3, The Lives of Others.

This film is about how the cruelty of a few destroys the lives of many due to the acquisition and maintenance of unconscionable power:  personal, governmental and even, perhaps, worldwide.

The director, Kenji Mizoguchi's (1898-1956) elder sister was given up for adoption when the family encountered hard times.  Somewhat later she was sold as a geisha, affecting her brother's, and our director's, weltanschauung  profoundly. He was also privy to observing his father's brutal treatment of his mother and sister.

A star of the film, Kinkyo Tanaka, was the first Japanese woman who worked as a film director.  She first directed Love Letter in 1953, and she directed five further films as well.

This film is the best depiction of the experience of slavery (both of master and subject) that I am familiar with.  It is awesome, it is spellbinding, it is overwhelming.  It really has to be viewed in the marvellous Criterion footage of it to be adequatetly described!

The film is almost unbearably sad. One of the saddest films ever made. But photographically one of the most beautiful. At the moments of greatest anguish the camera, the observer, withdraws and sees the action in a larger setting of exquisite natural beauty. Mizoguchi involves us in the action, brings us to unbearable empathy, then moves us away, to distance, estrangement, detachment, contemplation ... Mizoguchi the sensual, passionate aesthete, lover of actresses, the theatre and social causes, and also the Buddhist seeing the suffering caused by illusion, attachment and passion ...

Sometimes we enter the world of cinema as if entering Plato's cave to be shown by the illusions on the wall how to live, how to be, become, better, in that beautiful and painful world outside ... Mizoguchi's film begins by a small stream and ends on a wide beach previously struck by a tidal wave, and in-between this journey of water and fire is a practice, art, lesson on balancing, harmonizing empathy and detachment, passion and transcendence ... toward perhaps the realization of what in Japanese aesthetics and religious experience is sometimes called yugen ... a word to google.",1245801600,8,1332,5.02262443438914

I'm a fan of foreign films, which are generally slower paced than American cinema, but slow pacing should serve a purpose - there is a limit beyond which the slow pacing takes away more than it adds. Also, the moral of the film is inherently unsatisfying - not because it doesn't offer some hackneyed happy ending, but because it attempts an inadequate compensatory ending - 'life was horrible and sad, but at least we have this'. It resolves as neither tragedy nor triumph, and though a viewer might feel it's realistic, it neither makes us feel good nor teaches us a deeper meaning. In the end, we have sympathy for characters, but would never wish to identify with them.

So, my first Japanese films were Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and Rashomon - being ranked on the IMDb Top 250. They were great! I immediately became a fan of Japanese cinema. Later I decided to check into a different director, and then I came up with Kenji Mizoguchi. I decided to give Ugetsu a try. When my order came in, I got around to watching it - at the time, I loved it! I thought it was quite an excellent little film. I liked it enough that I decided to check out Sansho the Bailiff, which has a higher rating on IMDb, although sadly not on the Top 250. I actually was more interested to see this one than Ugetsu. So I was excited, I knew I was up for an even bigger treat. It arrived and I couldn't wait to pop it in my DVD player! Once the movie started, I was not disappointed... What an amazing film I thought to myself. It has got to be one of the very best films I've ever seen! It has such a brilliant story and it is well told through to the end - which is such a beautiful ending! It's almost a shame that some people won't even look at films like this, it almost pains me that I can't even get my own mother to sit down and watch it with me, and if you've seen the ending of the film you will understand what I mean... I find that the story is a little similar to Ugetsu, but what is amazing is the big difference they are in terms of quality film-making! Sansho the Bailiff is far better told, more engaging, sharper in direction and pacing, and far more beautiful! I even went back and re-watched Ugetsu and I thought it was an average film in comparison to Sansho the Bailiff! This film even has one of those qualities that it's so perfect, that you can't help but want to watch it over and over! Oh how much I recommend any true fan of cinema to check out Sansho the Bailiff! It is certainly now one my of dearest favorites.

I also would like to state that Criterion is an absolute savior to cinema, it has gathered some amazing films from around the world and places them in DVD collections of film-goers. I'm looking forward to buying more Criterion Collections eventually as soon as I can save up some money, as they can be a little expensive, but they are often worth the price nonetheless! It sure beats half the films that comes out these days...

Anyone who is reading this, definitely give this masterpiece a try! It deserves to be better known by the mainstream film-goers as it possibly can, classics like this shouldn't ever be forgotten! I certainly will be viewing it a few more times by the year is out! Hopefully I can get my mother to watch it with me some day... -_-",1222473600,6,2752,4.248091603053435
596498,5,6303202039,"One of the nostra about Japanese film director Kenji Mizoguchi is that
he is 'the most Japanese of all filmmakers.' Another is that, compared
to his two titanic contemporaries, Yasujiro Ozu and Akira Kurosawa,
Mizoguchi was the hardest to pin down in a style or genre. Having just
watched his 1954 film Sansho The Bailiff (Sansh Day) I can agree with
both of the above sentiments, for Mizoguchi excels at the jidai-geki
(historical drama) genre. Furthermore, I can do so after having seen
just one other Mizoguchi film, Ugetsu Monogatari. Whereas Ugetsu is
spiritual and poetic, Sansho is worldly and realistic. This despite the
fact that the source materials for the film (legends and short fiction)
are rife with supernatural overtones.

The screenplay was written by Fuji Yahiro, and adapted from the legend
and a 1915 short story, Sansho The Steward, by Ogai Mori. Reputedly,
Mizoguchi wanted the film to more closely follow the titular character,
rather than the brother and sister who dominate the film. And while
that would have been a more daring choice (the equivalent of focusing
on the Big Bad Wolf rather than Little Red Riding Hood) the Daiei
Studio's insistence on exploring the brother and sister tale of Zushio
(Masahiko Kato) and Anju (Keiko Enami) allowed Mizoguchi to add layers
of psychological depth and realism to what had always been little more
than a Japanese fairy tale. That said, the screenplay is outstanding,
even if it is a bit depressing. It reminded me, in its unending
emotional declension, of Theo Angelopolous's Trilogy: The Weeping
Meadow....The film truly evokes human growth potential at a root level.
Zushio feels, through much of the film, that it is Anju who is the
force he must rely on, yet, it is only after her death that he is
emboldened enough to do all the courageous things he does. And the
stellar cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa only adds to the film. Rarely
does a film so totally rely on a single element as this does. In
Sansho, it is the diagonal placement of spears, branches, and other
objects to bisect the screen, as well as the use of many shades of gray
to suggest color where there is none. In a sense, this film reminds me
of a black and white version of Michelangelo Antonioni's The Red
Desert, which used color in an emotive and narrative way the way
Miyagawa uses gray shadings in this film.

There is little wonder that this film won its year's Silver Lion at the
Venice Film Festival- the third straight Mizoguchi film to do so,
following Life Of Oharu and Ugetsu Monogatari. The DVD, by The
Criterion Collection, is shown in a 1.33:1 aspect ration, and the print
is nearly flawless, save for a few scratches at the opening and closing
credits. The disk also contains interviews with film critic Tadao Sato,
Mizoguchi's first assistant director Tokuzo Tanaka, and the actress who
played the grown Anju, Kyoko Kagawa. There is a film commentary track
by Japanese literature professor Jeffrey Angles, which is solid,
focusing more on the historical roots of the mythos and how Mizoguchi
parallaxed his film against that past. Angles is at his best in this
aspect, but falters and gets a bit fey and didactic when trying to
discuss the more cinematic aspects of the film. He also, at his worst,
is manifestly reading from a prepared text rather than reacting to the
images on screen. The package is rounded out by a booklet with an
essay, The Lessons Of Sansho, by film scholar Mark Le Fanu, and two
print versions of the legend- Ogai Mori's 1915 short story, and an
earlier mythic tale.

Mizoguchi shows himself, in just the two films I've seen thus far, to
be far more daring in both subject matter and style than either of his
two great rivals, Ozu and Kurosawa. This alone does not make nor imply
he is the greater filmmaker, but it does stake out a territory that is
his alone. There is, indeed, more than just one way to achieve
greatness, and Mizoguchi seems to have tried many, yet his success
seems hardly of the 'throw a thousand darts and get one bullseye' sort.

Sansho The Bailiff is a great film, due to its realism, to the point of
going to the opposite end of a typical Hollywood ending, and also
because almost every second of the film serves a purpose that is later
elaborated upon. It is a flower whose opening bud seems eternal, and
whose interior can only be sniffed. Thus, I'd have to rate it a bit
above Ugetsu Monogatari, as great as that film was. This is because
watching a film Sansho The Bailiff makes one not only a happier viewer,
but a better person. No, I do not mean that in the trite sense so many
PC commentaries imply; that its humanist message of kindness over
cruelty will 'ennoble you,' but in the sense that all great art makes
its audience better, for it does not merely tell you something the art
and/or artist feels the audience should know, but because it actively
stimulates a greater intellect by forcing the viewer to cogitate upon
it, not only as it unfolds but long afterwards. It is, in this way,
truly transcendental, beyond the hokey pseudo-Orientalist way the term
is usually defined. Sansho The Bailiff does this, and in spades, for it
moves at multiple levels of consciousness- the emotive, the
intellectual, and that indefinable other that exists betwixt, to move
its percipient. It is a political film, yet one made with great
subtlety, that shows how dilemmas great and small are resolved and not,
something that both old and modern shrill Hollywood PC schlock (think
Crash) are simply unable or unwilling to do. Japanese or not, Mizoguchi
left a masterful work of art for all the rest of us to grow on.",1221609600,3,5628,4.710659898477157
596548,3,6303202039,"This is a sad story, and it made me greatfull for all that I have today in my life.  The movie is well directed and the actors did a good job for a black and white movie.
But I don't know if I will watch it again... it's in my collection anyway.",1220572800,4,245,3.7115384615384617
596549,5,6303202039,"What an utterly spectacular movie.  It's billing as the greatest movie ever made is completely fitting.  The fact that Mizoguchi directed the beautiful Ugetsu the previous year is a phenomenal achievement.  Unequaled really, throughout the history of film.  Bold statement, to be sure, but one I firmly believe.
After a compassionate governor disobeys the tyrannical lord's orders, he is cast into exile.  His family suffers horribly--his wife is physically forced into a life of prostitution; the kids forced into slave labor.
This is a heartbreaking story, but also so rich and moving.  Mizoguchi uses his trademark long takes and sweeping camera movement.  The images he captures are so precise and elegant.  The final product is entertaining, simplistic, and mesmerising.  For serious fans of cinema, this is one you'll want to watch again immediately.  It doesn't get any better.",1215216000,5,884,5.340579710144928
596550,5,6303202039,"Director Kenji Mizoguchi once dropped his shirt and exposed his back to a colleague. There were two scars that were the result of razor slashes. He got it from a prostitute he was seeing. Mizoguchi said, ""you see these? Until you get them, you are not allowed to make any movies about women.""

Mizoguchi combines his lifelong focus on the theme of women's plight, with fantastic photography and top-shelf acting in this dazzling film of sheer cinematic craft.

Not a single frame is wasted. If you randomly picked any scene from the movie, the composition will be classically proportioned. Negative space is gorgeously balanced to a T and the lighting is absolutely iridescent. Sansho is a two-hour seminar on photographic composition. With each scene, I asked myself, ""How long can Kazuo Miyagawa (cinematographer) keep this up? Nobody can be that good consistently!""

I stand corrected. Up until the final frame, every shot is spectacularly composed.

The story is about a family split up by vicissitudes and crooked people. Armed with only a two-sentence precept, a child must endure a life of slavery and cruelty before he attempts escape in order to re-unite his once noble family. The humane story is beautifully acted, reaching a level of conviction that one almost feels it's a real life consequence. The speech when Yoshiaki Hanayagi announces the end of slavery in the compound is so intense, you feel the madness radiating off the screen where human beings are indentured in chains. Mizoguchi's indigenous Japanese style shines under his always sympathetic narrative of women's condition in olden times.

One of the handful of movies that actually brought tears to my eyes. As the classical motif of a woman singing a plaintive chant, longing to be reunited with loved ones is an often repeated image in Japanese folk music.  Also for me, there is no message greater than the one presented here: the importance of the humane act as a moral code of conduct.

Watching this movie just made me more painfully aware of the sad fact that once there existed a society that made such carefully crafted films, and after all these decade, all these technological leaps, and all the human inflicted atrocities we have seen, that craft is all but lost in the loud bombastic CGI-manipulated special effects of Hollywood creations.",1210636800,3,2329,5.002583979328166
596551,5,6303202039,"Kenji Mizoguchi directed some of the greatest films of the 1950's, Ugetsu, Princess Yang Kwai Fei, Street of Shame, but none better than this dense, unpredictable, almost unbearably sad masterpiece. Sansho the Bailiff is such a beautiful-brutal, poetic-gritty, simple-complex, uplifting-devastating epic journey from death into life, or maybe half-life at best, but life nonetheless, that most other films seem puny, insignificant in its wake, mere movies whereas Sansho the Bailiff is a supreme work, not only of art but of humanity.

When I saw Sansho a year ago at Columbus'  Wexner Center for the Arts it was one of the most powerful film-going experiences in my life. Unfortunately, a pretty measly crowd was on hand while just a few weeks later, in the very same theater, a full house avidly sat through Jacques Rivette's trivial Celine and Julie Go Boating. Apparently modern arthouse audiences prefer snide, tacky irreverence and crass pretentiousness to heartfelt human drama. Their loss.  Sansho the Bailiff doesn't get the same praise or press as Citizen Kane, Vertigo or The Rules of the Game but it is clearly in the same league. By the time the lights went up in that theater in Columbus, I was speechless. Watching it again on Criterion's gorgeous DVD edition, I felt the same impact. Strike that, I did manage to utter one word once the film was over, and that word was ""Wow."" It's still hard for me to believe that such a sublime and nearly perfect work of art even exists, not only that but that it belongs to the medium of film, a format that too often underestimates its own ability to elicit genuine awe, that too often settles for tawdriness and stupidity.

What makes this such a remarkable film? It's hard for me to put into words but I'll try. Sansho is a film of stark contrasts, with scenes of unsurpassed poetic beauty side by side with moments of cringe-inducing brutality and inhumanity to rival even Schindler's List. Tamaki and her family traveling through a field of tall, wavering flowers. Tamaki  being forced onto a boat by bandits, ripped from her children so they can be sold into slavery. Anju slowly, delicately disappearing into a pool of water to die. An old man screaming as he is held down and his forehead is branded. Watching Sansho the Bailiff, the viewer continually gets the feeling of being kicked in the gut, yet is constantly overwhelmed by Mizoguchi's timeless imagery, his humility and deceptive simplicity of character, of style, his sense of the poetic effect of a single image, the way he allows music and pacing to create a haunting, ethereal mood that leaves an indelible impression, most of all the way he finds spirituality in the most abject suffering. That's about as much as I can say because Sansho is the type of film that defies intellectual analysis, deconstruction,  it connects with the viewer on a deeply emotional level, more than that, it communicates to the viewer, in its own unique way, sometimes subtle and sometimes overbearing, what it means to suffer and persevere and sacrifice and love, in short what it means to be human. No other film affects me this way, and I consider myself fortunate for having experienced it.

Sansho the Bailiff isn't my favorite film. Either La Dolce Vita or Lawrence of Arabia would occupy the number one slot in my personal hall of fame. But if a person came up to me and said that Sansho the Bailiff is the greatest movie ever made, I probably wouldn't argue with him, because Mizoguchi's masterpiece is more than just a film, it's an experience. Watch it, and experience it for yourself.",1203724800,2,3599,4.842276422764227
596552,5,6303202039,"I had heard about ""Sansho the Bailiff"" for years and I must say that I was not prepared for what I saw when I watched it today.  This is a masterfully told story that leaves us wishing that the story had a different ending.  It is Shakespearean in the scope of its' tragedy and leaves us rather numb.  At least, it left me rather numb.

As I was explaining Japanese movies to my teenage son, I told him we have our Westerns and the Japanese have their Samurais.  This is of the proper era although it really doesn't qualify as a Samurai movie.  It is a morality tale that speaks to the importance of mercy by showing us a part of the world where there was no mercy.  In making its' point, it gives no quarter.  We can argue for different results but we aren't stuck in a world for years in which no one cares; at least no one who can do anything to help.

There are a wide range of emotions on display in ""Sansho the Bailiff"" which, along with its' sets and costumes are the essential source of the movie's greatness.  Kudos to the director, Kenji Mizoguchi and the excellent cast.  This is the same director of the classic movie ""Ugetsu"" and these two movies are reason enough to search out more of his work.

596553,5,6303202039,"Many mention Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu as the titans of Japanese cinema.  Kenji Mizoguchi rarely gets mentioned much, yet, his films are as good (and sometimes better) than the aformentioned filmmakers.  In fact, Kurosawa said in an interview that out of all Japanese directors, he admired Mizoguchi the best.  This is arguably Mizoguchi's greatest work, a work of deep sadness and beauty.  ""Be hard on yourself, but merciful to others"" is the advice that the father gives the son in this film.  The father is a governor of a province, and when he defies an order from the Shogungate, he is relieved of his duties and forced into exile.  The family splits up, and the son becomes a very angry, brutal man.  Eventually, he remembers his father's words and stops this, determined to reunite his family at any cost.  SPOILER...He does succeed to some degree, but in a very unexpected (and haunting) way.  This is one of the saddest films I've ever seen.  It is also a masterpiece of composition and framing.  Mizoguchi uses long takes to really give his work that gentle, contemplative tone to it.  It's very similar to Tarkovsky, Malick, and even Ozu.  This is a wonderful film, and I hope more people acknowledge Mizoguchi in the coming years.",1190937600,,1248,4.802816901408451
596554,5,6303202039,"This single-disc Criterion offering includes much that is useful to understanding Mizoguchi.

First, there is the film itself, which distills Mizoguchi's humanist and feminist themes into a simple story using a few well-defined characters. It is from a traditional story, passed along for centuries and existing in many forms. Mizoguchi and his screenwriter have honed it to reflect themes common to Mizoguchi films going back to the silent era, but taking on special significance directly following the American occupation of Japan, when both the treatment of women and effective management of the work force were major national concerns.

As always with Mizoguchi, shot composition derives much from traditional Japanese art, and blocking of action owes much to traditional Japanese theatre. In his ability to relate a story with precise moral dimensions within the confines of a compact melodrama, Mizoguchi shows here, as elsewhere, his Western influences, particularly the theatre of Strindberg and O'Neill.

The commentary track, given by a folklorist who put an immense amount of preparation into his remarks, is often illuminating, even if it sometimes edges very near the pedantic. For me, it was worth hearing the entire track, because somehow it got me thinking about how, even in the process of stripping this traditional folktale of its magical elements, the filmmaker retained a story in which there remains a blurring of the natural and supernatural in the intercommunication of its protagonists.

The three (brand new) videotaped extras are each extraordinary in their own ways. Between the recollections of star Kyoko Kagawa (still working regularly and looking gorgeous at 75), and interviews with the First AD and a very impressive Japanese film historian, a very interesting and complex picture of Mizoguchi emerges. He was somehow simultaneously one of the most exacting of directors, and also a person who could be maddeningly ""hands off"" at critical times. One has only to see UGETSU to know that he was a one-of-a-kind artist, but the information from these various sources help begin to define, if not unravel, the mystery of his creative genius.",1190505600,,2171,5.3391812865497075

596556,5,6303202039,"Director Kenji Mizoguchi's classic, ""Sansho The Bailiff,"" is definitely one of the greatest films in cinema. This film is more than deserving of its 5 star rating. Having owned the VHS for many years, it was a thrill to finally purchase this great film by this talented director. ""Ugetsu,"" will always be my favorite Mizoguchi film, however, ""Sansho The Bailiff,"" is not too far behind. I first saw this great classic well over 30 years ago, and this latest CRITERION release is a fabulous and highly recommended film.

I do not wish to spoil this film for those of you who have not seen it yet, however, I will write that this film is a bona-fide masterpiece of cinema. The films narrative takes place in medieval Japan and follows the injustice meted out to a benevolent governor. Because he genuinely cares for the peasants who must endure a tax burden, and refuses to tax them further, he is banished. And as a result, his wife and children must embark on a precarious journey to meet up with him. However, this is not a happy film, as the mother is unexpectedly separated from her two children: a boy and a girl. And what follows is one sad and harrowing tale of cinema, as the mother is forced into prostitution while her children must endure a painful and hard existence in a slave labor camp.

Mizoguchi gives the viewer, as with all his films, mankind's own inhumanity to one another. Mizoguchi does not paint a pretty picture in this tale. The children are sold to Sansho the Bailiff, who during this time period of Japan has sole possession of the children. He is judge, jury and executioner. Do not go into this film expecting to be uplifted with joy. On the contrary, this film is extremely sad. Mizoguchi gives his audience a morality tale. This film basically shows the children's plight as they grow up in captivity under the ever watchful eye of Sansho. They have changed---especially the boy. This is a moving film, and CRITERION did an excellent job with the transfer.

As with the film UGETSU, CRITERION has released the film with additional material. There is an audio commentary by Japanese literature professor Jeffrey Angles. Moreover, there are interviews with critic Tadao Sato, assistant director Tokuzo Tanaka, and actress Kyoko Kagawa who share their thoughts about the making of this great film, and more importantly about director Kenji Mizoguchi. Also, there is a booklet titled ""The Lessons Of Sansho,"" by Mark Le Fanu about the film. This DVD is highly, highly recommended, and belongs in your cinema collection.

Basically it's a tale about what makes us humans different from animals; what makes civilization, therefore it's quite a religious film too, although on the Buddhist side: knowing mercy, the power of love against cruelty, the power of hope springing from the soul that won't quit fighting against reality, harsh reality. But most of all it's about sacrificing oneself, just what Christ had to do for us because of our sinful nature. So it won't be a very politically-correct film for those who deny the nature of sin and the need for redemption through sacrifice. The truth is the truth, whether you are in Japan in the 11th century or 20th, or whether you are an American, yesterday, today or tomorrow.

It's a film to make you suffer through thinking, humbling yourself. Freedom is not free, is a phrase that applies to all times. The truth will set you free. Slavery is not a physical state, it is a spiritual state.

It's the second Mizoguchi film that I see (I prefer Ugetsu) and I notice the same sad tone in both. I wish it had something else, something more appealing. Kurosawa, I think, is  the greatest Japannese director ever: He made films as good as this one but they are never boring. Nevertheless, it's a beautiful film.",1186272000,12,1408,4.597609561752988

It is so harrowing to watch -- not because of violence but because of heart-rending situations -- that American viewers used to at least a bit of comic relief and/or ""uplift,"" even in films billed as tragic, may be squirming.

I probably wouldn't go that far, but it is an excellent movie ranking amongst the best of the genre, standing tall with Kurosawa Akira films such as ""Red Beard."" It is very heavy, with a strong message.

Like Kurosawa, social responsibility is a strong theme in Mizoguchi's works. In ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" we see a blending of the social classes, as an honest aristocrat is exiled, his wife sold to a brothel and his children made slaves, all because the aristocrat believed peasants deserved happiness as well, and that the aristocratic class had responsibilities to the peasants. Mixed together, you see cruelty and mercy amongst both classes, from the tyrannical Sansho and his friendly son Taro, or the martyred slave Namiji and the cruel Zushio willing to brand another slave on the head with a hot iron.

To this there is the message of mercy. ""Be hard on yourself, but merciful to others"" is the mantra passed from parent to child. A sacred image of Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy, is a family heirloom, passed down from generations as a reminder.

As in all Mizoguchi's films, it is ultimately the women who suffer, bearing the sins of men on their capable shoulders. Mizoguchi is considered a feminist in Japan, although the standards are different and most Americans would probably not consider ""Sansho the Bailiff"" a feminist film.

It is nice to see this important film get the Criterion treatment. Along with the usual pristine transfer and updated subtitles, a translated version of Ogai Mori's 1915 ""Sansho Dayu,"" the story that inspired ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" is also included.",1172793600,68,1735,4.951890034364261

Regardless, the film is great. ""Sansho the Bailiff"" gives the viewer a very bleak view of medieval Japan. This has long been one of my favorite films, however, I have many favorite films by Japanese directors, therefore, I am a bit biased. Even so, this is a great film. I am very pleased to hear that the film has been released on DVD, from 'Films Sans Frontieres,' and I will have to look for this DVD. This is a film that will consume anyone who views it. My wife cried when I first showed her the film many years ago.

Mizoguchi gives the viewer [like he did in 'UGETSU'] a story with a very haunting plot, that is both sad, deeply moving and profound. Which is why I have always liked his films. Moreover, he was a master of visualization, and the way he worked the camera was truly incredible. Although he is not as widely known in the West, as he is in Japan, I find his work compelling and awesome in its totality. He is in my opinion right up there with Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, to name just two great directors whose works I admire and have.

In the film, Mizoguchi shows the viewer the importance of social resposibility: A major theme in his films. [As did Kurosawa] The film begins with the life of a woman, Tamaki, who places her two children, Zushio and Anju, in the forest. She attempts to meet up with her husband who has been banished. However, the children are kidnapped, and she is forced into prostitution. Another common theme in Mizoguchi's films are his heartfelt depiction of women. I first saw this classic film many years ago, and was deeply moved by this great film. This is a hauntingly beautiful film, and I believe that you will be moved by this classic.

The acting is wonderful, and the music excellent.  There are a number of scenes that would likely be startlingly beautiful if shot in color, but fit the starkly tragic mood in black and white.  Hopefully this great movie will soon be restored and transferred to DVD.  Highly recommended.",1155945600,7,652,5.281553398058253
596602,5,6303202039,"""Sansho Dayu"" is so great and so beautiful. It is one of my very favorite films.

First of all, thank you so much, Andrew (reviewer below), for letting us know about the truly excellent Films Sans Frontieres DVD edition (which also comes with a beautiful DVD of Mizoguchi's superb film ""Crucified Lovers""). I got so tired of waiting for Criterion to put out a DVD of this film that I went ahead and ordered the two-disc set from XploitedCinema and was not disappointed by the quality. I have now given away my lousy Home Vision VHS tape. Until Criterion steps up, the Films Sans Frontieres edition is definitely the one to own!

Second of all, even though the label says Region-Two PAL, I am pretty sure that the Films Sans Frontiere DVDs are actually REGION-FREE NTSC discs, because I can play them on my Region-One NTSC player without any problem at all. So I don't think Americans will need a Multi-Region player to watch these fine films. I bet they will play just fine on their standard Region-One DVD players.

Third of all, I just want to approve what everybody else has said about how great this film is. It is a truly beautiful experience that will shatter your heart. There is nobody like Mizoguchi and no film like ""Sansho Dayu"".

10 stars for the wonderful film, 1.5 stars for the crummy video tape. Instead you should definitely get the French DVDs (with English sub-titles) put out by Films Sans Frontieres, available in the U.S. from XploitedCinema. You won't regret it!",1155513600,20,1485,4.67816091954023

I first saw this overwhelming masterpiece when I was ten (it was part of a Japanese film festival on my local PBS station decades ago). Even at my callow age, I was utterly floored by the power and beauty of Sansho. It was so expertly constructed that I could remember almost every scene twenty years later--particularly the scene where [...] disappears beneath the water in an act of self-sacrifice. It was so emotionally shattering and hauntingly beautiful that I never forgot it. At long last, when I was middle aged, Sansho appeared at my local art film theater and I went to see if it was as good as I remembered. It wasn't. It was even better! My memory hadn't exaggerated it. Sansho is a supreme work of cinematic art.

I suppose I could bore you with breathless descriptions of Mizoguchi's unsurpassed mastery of the camera, his amazing use of long takes and panoramic views, his Shakespearean humanism, his heartfelt sympathy for the downtrodden (particularly women), his elementally powerful yet intellectually sophisticated stories, his paradoxical combination of devastating intensity and Olympian detachment, etc. etc. But instead I will simply say: You must see this great, great work of art at least once before you die.

P.S. I have to join everyone else here in begging, pleading with Criterion or some other reputable company to PLEASE issue a restored version of this masterpiece on DVD soon! It's a crime that we don't have one yet.",1110240000,22,1528,4.9147286821705425

(1954, Japan, 125 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)

Spoilers ahead!

Sansh Day is Mizoguchi Kenjis most perfect film and one of the corner stones of world cinema. Personally, The Life of Oharu (1952) means more to me and I probably want to watch Ugetsu Monogatari (1953) most often of all, but of the three jidaigeki which won awards at Venice in three consecutive years, Sansh Day is the most perfectly structured and the most satisfying both intellectually and aesthetically. It is fully the equal of and structurally superior to Kurosawa Akiras Seven Samurai with which it shared the top prize in 1954. Stylistically poles apart, both jidaigeki journey to the heart of the human condition in profound meditations on what it takes for man to survive chaos. Kurosawas masterpiece is all about the superbly paced action sequences, the astonishing editing and the muscular way his characters are etched out to provide a profoundly moving dazzling spectacle without parallel anywhere. Mizoguchis film on the other hand is altogether quieter, sadder and (on the surface at least) simpler. The films opening epitaph describes it as One of the worlds folk tales full of grief, and it is in essence a Buddhist meditation on the importance of mercy in perilous pre-civilization times (the film is set in the 11th century chaos of the late Heian era), as well as a meditation on the transitory nature of human existence termed muj, which translates as the evanescence of all earthly things, the mutability of all earthly phenomena. Life is suffering and one cannot avoid ones fate, the wheel of existence turning inexorably in an acceptance of both life and after-life as a single complete entity forever rejuvenating itself. Renunciation of material desires and the assertion of spiritual purity wherein the self is sacrificed for the greater good are the values of the day in a work of art which is more than just a mere film. It is an article of Faith.

As is well known, Mizoguchi (like his father before him) converted to Nichiren Buddhism in 1953 and people are always recalling the incident when Tanaka Kuniyo entered his bedroom in Venice to find him on his knees praying to Buddha that he wouldnt leave the city until his Ugetsu Monogatari won an award at the film festival which of course it duly did. He carried a Buddhist icon of Kwannon, the Goddess of mercy, similar to the one that is so important in Sansh Day around with him wherever he went. This conversion has been treated with a fair amount of skepticism by critics, especially Japanese ones who saw behind it a cynical ploy to please the foreign press (especially the Italians and the French) and to win another award and yet more kudos for himself. Foreigners wanted to see traditional Japanese culture and so Mizoguchi duly obliged, also throwing in a denunciation of the fascism that had gripped Japan from the 1930s through to 1945 with the films destruction of Sanshs slave labor camp. It is revealing that the film has never been as popular in Japan as the preceding jidaigeki which themselves had barely been noticed. Only the foreign attention turned the heads of domestic audiences who were actually more interested in gendaigeki modern day tales and in the more obvious visceral excitement of Kurosawa. I would suggest that whether Mizoguchis conversion was genuinely motivated or not, both Ugetsu Monogatari and Sansh Day are intensely Buddhist works and rather than cynically deride the directors motivations we should simply evaluate what we have in front of us.

As is often the case in great art, profundity lies in simplicity and the story (Yoda Yoshikata adapting Mori gais take on the ancient folk tale which has come down from oral tradition) is a straightforward morality tale. The late Heian era was a time of chaos, an era when mankind had not awakened as human beings. The governor of Mutsu (in present day Aomori) named Taira no Masauji (Shimizu Masao) is being deposed for being too liberal, too democratic with the peasants. Before being sent to exile in Tsukushi (Fukuoka) he instructs his wife Tamaki (Tanaka Kuniyo) to take his two children Zushi (later Hanayagi Yoshiaki) and Anju (later Kagawa Kyko) to her brothers place in Iwashiro (Fukushima). As he says goodbye he gives an icon of Kwannon to Zushi and forces him to memorize the moral of the film: Without mercy, man is like a beast. Even if you are hard on yourself, be merciful to others. All men are created equal. Everyone is entitled to their happiness. Seven years later the three are journeying to meet their father when they are tricked by an evil priestess who sells them to pirates. Tamaki is sold off to a brothel on Sad Island (off the coast of Niigata) while the children are sold to the slave labor camp of Sansh Day (Shind Eitar) where they are made to work as adults. Ten years pass and Zushi has forgotten his fathers instruction to be merciful. He is now an overseer and on Sanshs command brands an old mans face with a hot iron. Zushi and Anju learn their mother is still alive on Sad from a recently arrived girl and in a miraculous forest epiphany Anju insists Zushi run away while she occupies the guard. Knowing she will be tortured to tell where Zushi has gone she drowns herself in a lake. Zushi hides in a nearby temple and eventually gets to Kyt where he appeals to the Emperors chief advisor who at first dismisses and imprisons him, but then tells him about his fathers death and rewards him with the title of governor of Tango, the Kwannon icon proving Zushis identity. Sanshs slave camp is in Tango and Zushi journeys back, frees the slaves and sends Sansh into exile. Importantly, he does not kill him (he shows mercy) and also importantly, he renounces his title (and all material desires) and journeys to Sad to find his mother. Mother and son are reunited on a deserted beach, she now decrepit, blind, worn-out. In an unbearably moving scene Zushi tells her that Father and Anju are both dead and he has renounced his title in order to be faithful to Fathers instructions. Tamaki replies with one of the most heart-breaking closing lines in cinema  But I know that you have followed your fathers teachings. And that is why we have been able to meet again.

From the fathers morality lesson to the mothers closing words, the theme of mercy (and its binary opposite tyranny) streams through the films narrative with the Kwannon icon hanging around Zushis neck linking the two ends seamlessly. On receiving the icon Zushi repeats his fathers mantra several times. Seven years later he is still repeating the words. When the travelers meet the evil priestess she seems to offer mercy, but she is actually on the side of tyranny as are the pirates who separate the mother from the kids. When the kids arrive at Sanshs camp he says, Show them no mercy! But they are shown mercy by Namiji (Tachibana Kimiko) and then by Sanshs son Tar (Kno Akitake) who has Zushi repeat the mantra before going off to practice it himself by becoming a priest. In the camp we are given numerous examples of tyranny, slaves worked to the bone, whipped and beaten, Sansh branding a rebel, and eventually Zushi taking over the branding having lost belief in his fathers words. Redemption is at hand through the tyranny of him abandoning a sick Namiji on a mountainside transforming into mercy, saving her life and escaping in the process. The Kwannon icon which Anju had given to Namiji as Zushi no longer needed it is returned to him. Possessing it wills him to resume his fathers fight against tyranny. At first though, mercy must be shown to him both by the priests at the nearby temple who hide him and then eventually (after first being imprisoned  tyrannized) by the Emperors chief advisor. Hes another person inspired to mercy by regarding the icon and remembering Zushis father. The film shows that all power is evil whether it be the dark Ministry of the Right who control Sanshs manner, or the Imperial authorities who though less barbarous are still un-empowered to abolish slavery. Zushi rebels against both by using his power to destroy Sanshs slave camp and then by giving it up in a gesture of renunciation, a process key to the Buddhist faith. Zushi shows mercy to Sansh by not killing him as he must surely want to and he shows it again by apologizing to the old slave Nio (Sugai Ichir) for having branded him earlier. He renounces all material desires, indeed all material possessions except for his Kwannon icon so that he can meet his mother on a footing wholly observant of his fathers words.

So far, so over-schematic one might say, and people have accused this film of being excessively simple-minded. However, this is to ignore the exquisite power that charges the films narrative structure with such emotional gravitas. This power lies in a song and its appearance and re-appearance throughout the film ratchets up the tension to an extraordinary degree impelling us from family break-up to family reunion with an unstoppable momentum which fairly sears off the screen. It begins with the scene of the three travelers and their nurse making a camp for the night. Zushi and Anju have fun cutting thatch to use for a makeshift shelter. They cut a branch together and they tumble backwards laughing. It is an intimate moment between the two kids. Then off-screen we hear their mother Tamaki calling them by their names, her voice floating miraculously across the air. Later in Sanshs camp after ten years have passed a woman from Sad is brought in and she starts to sing a beguiling song which reminds us of this earlier scene (ZushiAnju, how I long for you). This alerts Anju to the knowledge that her mother is still alive and queues up an exquisitely inserted sequence on Sad, the song distorting as we cross the water to see Tamaki frantically trying to escape from the island to find her kids. She is caught, dragged back to her brothel and maimed (her tendon is cut) in a traumatic scene. Lastly we see her hobbling back to the cliff where she stares back at the mainland taking up her sad song again. We are returned to the camp and Zushi irritably tells Anju to stop singing the song. Things change in the forest when Anju hears her mothers song wafting magically through the air. They cut thatch to shield Namiji and tumbling backwards they remember that time when their mother called them long ago. This changes Zushi who undergoes an extraordinary redemption afforded through his sister. He suggests they escape, but Anju wants to do it her way. He will escape with Namiji while she detains the guard. The plan works for Zushi, but for Anju her decision means the ultimate sacrifice. The exquisite lake scene is one of the glories of cinema and is set up in four simple but perfectly calculated shots. First we see Anju advancing to the silver water through the trees. Then Mizoguchi cuts to a closer shot still framed with foliage but showing Anjus back as she advances into the water. Then we hear her mothers song again wafting over the lake (ZushiAnju, how I long for you), an effect which sends shivers down ones spine. Mizoguchi cuts away to show an old woman watching the scene (one of his ever-present inscribed narrator-observers which makes us FEEL and OBSERVE the action simultaneously), but then quickly cuts back to the lake as we catch the moment just after Anjus head has sunk under the water surface and the ripples radiate out in circles like an aching memory. Words cant describe the ineffable beauty of this scene, but the thing we carry most of all are the mothers words which pushes us on ravenously to desire a final family reunion and an end to the mothers suffering. Mizoguchi makes us wait of course and when the extraordinary final scene comes it comes with the same song although this time uttered haltingly from the cracked lips of a decrepit wreck of a woman sitting in a field beating the ground with a stick. Again, I find it impossible to find words for the sheer emotional power of this scene, a scene which the whole film has been building up to from the very beginning. As mother and son embrace, the camera cranes up in a manner similar to the ending of Ugetsu Monogatari. There peasants are seen toiling in the fields, here a man is raking seaweed to use as fertilizer, a very potent image of hope and of the rejuvenation of life. One cycle of life has been completed and another is set to begin with Zushi and Tamaki together in the world of the living and Anju and the father together in the world of the dead, all four united albeit across the great divide. As Mizoguchis crane pans across the beach to look at the sea Hayasaka Fumios memorable music builds up to a huge crescendo unprecedented in Mizoguchis output and, one is tempted to say, in the whole of cinema. It has the same grandeur for me as the embryo floating back to Earth at the end of Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The fact that this conclusion is so satisfying indicates how miraculously the films narrative structure in toto works.

Of course there is a lot more to the film than a heavily accented treatise on mercy and a beguiling song, though these, believe it or not, are the essential elements. But what gives the film its fascinating complexity is a sustained meditation on muj, the transitory nature of human existence. This change is expressed in a number of ways. Most obviously all the characters are transience personified. Tamaki starts the wife of a nobleman, is sold to prostitution, broken by time and then redeemed as a mother at the end. Anju and Zushi start as the children of a noble family and become slaves. Anju perishes but Zushi becomes a despot (the branding of Nio), redeems himself back to his fathers position and then relinquishes all power in the end to revert back to dutiful son. The father starts as a figure of authority, but is stripped of his power and exiled to Tsukushi, a place in Kysh where traditionally criminals are sent to be punished (Sad is another such place). Sanshs son Tar makes the transition from son of a despot to champion of mercy as a priest while Sansh himself morphs from camp commandant to street beggar. All is flux and life is ever transient as all these characters slip through the narrative to their various fates.

Mizoguchi himself draws attention to this muj through the filmmaking apparatus itself, through the narrative structure and through superb use of the dissolve. I said the narrative structure is simple before, but sometimes this simplicity is deceptive. The sheer complexity of the opening sequence of shots which flick unannounced backwards and forwards across seven years is difficult to comprehend on first watch as we seize onto the simple idea that a family has split up and is planning to come together again in the future. The seven year ellipse is only apparent when we look at the film carefully and its down to Mizoguchis formidable powers at rhythmic almost musical editing that complexity is made to look like simplicity itself. Watch the opening ten minutes and we see there no less than three flashbacks all linked with delicious dissolves to heighten the strong family ties that bind these people together, ties which are about to be ruptured. The film opens with Tamaki, her two children and their nurse walking down a stream en-route to meeting the father. As the adolescent Zushi runs down the path a wonderful dissolve takes us back seven years to Zushi running as a child. In the first flashback we learn the father is being exiled, the peasants are protesting and the new authorities are imposing the new order. We see the father as a kind liberal and from the profile of his kind wife Tamaki Mizoguchi executes an exquisite dissolve taking us back to her scooping water from a stream seven years later. As Tamaki lifts the cup up so there is another dissolve to the second flashback where the husband is sipping water from a cup. Tamaki looking right meets the face of her husband looking left across time. Here the father delivers the films moral to Zushi, giving him the Kwannon icon. From the icon there is another dissolve forward to the icon now hanging around the neck of the adolescent Zushi as he walks down the path repeating his fathers mantra. Then another dissolve takes us from Tamaki walking to Tamaki helping her husband put on his shoes, her last act of kindness before he leaves. As the father journeys along the seashore Mizoguchi dissolves finally back to our travelers seven years later walking down the same way  We are taking the same road as your father, Tamaki tells her children, the words obviously having the treble meaning of following the father geographically, emotionally and morally. In a breathtaking way, in these opening minutes Mizoguchi introduces all the characters, tells us what unites them together and tells us exactly what the film is all about  the various themes of family, mercy and geographical uncertainty all subject to the vast transience of life, or muj. The dissolve will appear two more times in the film, book-ending the sad sequence on Sad Island and Tamakis fate there. Its as if Mizoguchi elects to use the dissolve only to highlight the strong family links that are tested throughout the narrative, the dissolve being the one cinematic trick which most closely visualizes muj. The use of dissolves to highlight family connections prepares us for the shocking way the very last section on Sad is introduced. Its done not with a dissolve, but with a lengthy fade out which emphasizes the finality of the concluding mother/son reconciliation scene and the fact that we have reached the narratives destination.

Robin Wood in his article enclosed in the booklet talks about the importance of fire and water in the films visual structure. He draws short of ascribing literal meanings to the numerous appearances of both, but Id suggest that fire and water are the very agents of muj and Mizoguchi deliberately highlights the elements to strengthen the Buddhist framework of his work. We can somewhat simplistically say that water is connected with the mother, Tamaki while fire is connected with the tyrant, Sansh. This would be to equate water with goodness and fire with badness, but this is not Mizoguchis point. Obviously both elements have good and bad properties and the changes they effect are changes for the good as well as bad. Going through the film from the beginning, first we notice both water and fire have good properties before the family is afflicted. The family walk down an idyllic country stream, Tamaki draws a magical cup of water for her husband and they leave a peaceful campfire next to the sea in their walk along the seashore. Fire as a threat is announced by the torch the priestess carries followed by the fire in her home which offers delusive comfort. Threatening fire is also present in the pirates camp (a campfire) and as they push the women into the boats separating them from the kids, water becomes threatening for the first time as well. The nurse Ubatake (Naniwa Chieko) is drowned and the kids later learn a huge body of water now separates them from their mother now isolated on Sad. The very first shot of Sanshs slave camp features prominently a fire and next to it a slave being beaten. When we first see Sansh he is sitting by a huge fire and the element is strongly connected with tyranny as he tells his staff to show the kids no mercy. Water continues to be a burden (Anju is weighed down by having to carry pails of water across her shoulders), but fire continues to define tyranny the most, especially when Sansh takes an iron out of a fire and brands Namiji. Fire is also an important element of the portrait of greed and gluttony as Sansh entertains a rich guest from the Ministry of the Right, the gluttons eyes fastening on a box of gold and other goods while girls dance and torches burn infernally in the background, Tar looking on with disgust.

The film breaks for ten years during which time the kids grow up. Zushi has turned into a prototype Sansh himself, branding the old man Nio as his master looks on approvingly. Water also continues to be a negative element as Mizoguchi takes us to Sad to show us what is happening to Tamaki, the sea ever-connected with her suffering. The pivotal scene of the film is the forest redemption when Zushi suggests escape. The tension of the moment as Anju takes care of the guard and he prepares his escape is conveyed by water dripping to the left of the frame. Once out of shot, the water continues to drip on the soundtrack as we have the sound of its incessant beating accompanying the camp guards rushing to find Zushi and ordering Anju be confined. Water conveys hope here as it also does in the following lake suicide. Anjus death is an end of her life, but it is the beginning of a new life on the other side. In Buddhism life and after-life are one complete entity and Anjus death is as much an expression of freedom as an expression of extinction. The ambiguity of water (its properties negative as well as positive) in muj finds its greatest expression in this scene. Fire continues to suggest tyranny as Sanshs men sweep into the temple with their burning torches in search of Zushi, but after this point fire takes on positive features. The next time we see it as incense burning on Zushis fathers grave, a shot which also shows the sea as an equally benign presence. Fire becomes positively restorative the next time we meet it which is in Sanshs house after he has been exiled. Peasants cavort happily in front of huge happy flames, their freedom enabled by Zushis actions. In the penultimate scene as Zushi resigns his office he is told Sanshs house is burning down and we see the world changing this time for the better rather than for the worse. The films final scene is dominated by water and the events that have ravaged Tamakis poor life are rendered through metaphor as a tsunami, Zushi learning that Sad had been hit by one a year or so before. But as mother and son embrace and the camera cranes upwards and across the beach to the music rising so triumphantly the conclusion is that the sea (the water) which has for so long been destructive is now finally restorative.

It is rare to read an extended piece on Mizoguchis work without coming across some reference to his perennial theme of the suffering of women. Even though the main character here is a man (Zushi) and the film focuses most clearly on mercy/tyranny and a meditation on muj, female suffering is central to the whole of Sansh Day. The pivotal lake scene rests on Anjus decision to sacrifice herself for her brother. In practical terms it doesnt make sense. Why doesnt Zushi just jump the guard? He doesnt have to kill him. They could (with Namiji) escape if they simply gag him and tie him to a tree, for example. The decision to feature Anjus insistence on her way of doing things can only come from one thing  Mizoguchis absolute conviction that mankind evolves through the willing, unselfish suffering of women. As in all his jidaigeki (especially perhaps The Life of Oharu and Ugetsu Monogatari as well as here), he is concerned with constructing a legend of a woman who suffers for an idea of culture which is clearly valorize[d] in the end (Dudley Andrew). The idea is that Anju sacrifices herself so that Zushi can carry on their fathers teachings, that mercy is the greatest thing there is in human existence. As she makes her decision she ensures Zushi takes the Kwannon icon from Namijis body, the idea being she is saving her family, but she is also ensuring the fight against tyranny continues. The film indeed shows Sanshs dominion crashing down and it is enabled through Anjus sacrifice. The films heart though belongs to the mother, Tamaki whose suffering (and whose song) drives the film with such relentless force and extraordinary emotional resonance. Mizoguchi was probably thinking of his own mother who suffered domestic tyranny at the hands of his father before she died at a relatively young age when the boy needed her the most. He was attracted to plump maternal women all his life and with Miyagi (in Ugetsu Monogatari) Tamaki makes for a pair of heart-breaking mothers which really epitomize the directors very personal conviction that while the iniquities women suffer under patriarchy might well be terribly unfair and fully worthy of being fought (as they are in virtually all his gendaigeki work), the suffering of women is a necessary feature of social existence (Andrew), one which shapes civilization as it has come down to us. An artist cant do anything to change this unfair inequality (a stoic fact of human existence). All he can do is make people aware of it and in Sansh Day he makes probably cinemas greatest statement on the subject.",1486339200,2,24885,4.734378602720775

A recurring theme throughout the film is the conflict between one's duty to the established order, by which one's place in society is maintained, and the inherent human quality of mercy toward others, that can lead to one's own suffering and death.  The father puts his desire to treat the peasants under his control fairly above the welfare of his family, and they pay dearly for it.  Later, the opposite result is shown on a smaller scale when the son, Zushio, agrees to brand another slave's forehead with a hot iron, because this will ""get him on the master's good side.""

There are, seemingly, great rewards for exploiting your fellow man, as the cruel Sansho is under the protection of, ironically, ""the Minister of the Right,"" and as a result, he can torture and oppress his slaves with impunity.  He eventually gets what he deserves - he is sent into exile and his estate is burned, however, the only reason Zushio can escape is through his sister's sacrifice, and his rise to power is not through his own merits, but because a more powerful official rewards him as a way of honoring his father's memory.  There's an interesting shot when Zushio is thrown in jail while the official decides what to do with him, and while he's collapsed on the ground, sobbing, we see another prisoner behind him immobilized in a pillory.  This man seems impassive, at peace as he sleeps in the awkward position he's forced into, and later calmly eats soup from a bowl.  Suffering is a purely subjective experience.

The film is masterfully executed, as Mizoguchi composes his scenes like paintings, often with trees or other natural features in the foreground, framing the action within the larger natural world.  Several repetions, notably one where as children, Zushio and his sister Anju fall to the ground after trying to break a branch from a tree, is repeated later in a different context, and with a very different result.

The disc includes interviews with the actors and an excellent commentary by Japanese film authority Jeffrey Angles.  What comes through is the film's message that as individuals, we are born into and participate in society, both as heroes and victims, and that our decisions are constrained by a social system over which we have little control, and that both the good and the evil are in the end crushed and obliterated alike.  At the same time, along the way we have an opportunity to use whatever power we possess, either for the temporary satisfaction of our greed, or the small mercies that mitigate the inevitable torture of existence.",1442620800,2,2738,4.849785407725322
7841004,5,6303202039,"This 1954 movie, set in Medieval Japan, and directed by Japanese master Kenji Mizoguchi is a great adventure film. The story is a long one (warning, major point plots will be revealed ahead) but basically is about a brother and sister, Zushio and Anju, children of a powerful but honest governor, who are taken from their mother and sold into slavery once their father fells into disgrace. They are forced to work under horrible conditions in a camp run by the brutal Sansho of the title. They spend many years there, becoming young adults in the camp. Zushio eventually manages to escape. A high imperial official, moved by his story, appoints him governor of the region where Sanshos camp is located. This will allow him to exact justice for what happened to him. But will he be able to save his mother and sister?
Sansho is not the protagonist of the film, but he is a great villain. The actors include some stalwarts of Japanese classic cinema, such as Eitaro Shindo (who is great as Sansho), Kyoko Kagawa (playing Anju as an adult) or Kinuyo Tanaka (as the mother of Zushio and Anju). The movie's only weakness: a crucial plot point is hard to believe: the high official has scarcely met Zushio yet he quickly appoints him as a governor.",1434067200,,1242,4.65
