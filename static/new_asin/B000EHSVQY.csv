2520366,4,B000EHSVQY,"This is Peter Falk's movie debut and it's a doozy. He plays Abe Reles, a killer with ice water instead of blood in his veins whose favorite instrument to dispatch his victims is an icepick--appropriately enough. He oozes menace--so much so that you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen and when he's not on screen, you can't wait for him to show up again, even though he's seriously nasty.

The supporting cast is definitely good, but this is Falk's show, no question. In fact, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this movie. The story is of a contract killer organization, whose name is the movie's title, put together by Louis Lepke in New York in the 1930s. Reles is Murder Inc's top hit man. Made in 1960, this is a tough film that reeks of filmmaking at that time. Although the vintage cars are possibly the only real indicator of the timeframe (since the dialogue doesn't use much, if any, of the slang at that time in vogue), Falk's propulsive acting moves the movie slam-bang from beginning to end.

The aforementioned supporting cast includes Stuart Whitman before he started grating on most moviegoers' nerves, May Britt as his sexy wife, and Simon Oakland (really good) and Henry Morgan as the two cops committed to bringing down Murder Inc, as well as Vincent Gardenia (when he was actually thin!!) as Reles' sleazy lawyer (Gardenia is also very good here).

Hard to believe that the rumpled seemingly confused Columbo got his silver screen start as a really nasty piece of work, but there you go. He's a lot of fun to watch. Kudos as well to Oakland and Gardenia.

2520367,4,B000EHSVQY,"Murder Inc. is a fictionalized account of the real-life syndicate killing machine created by Louis ""Lepke"" Buchalter to tie up loose ends within the organization.

The film, based on a book written by the New York DA who prosecuted the group, is a told in semi-documentary style, and features a fantastic performance by Peter Falk as Abe ""Kid Twist"" Reles, one of the group's top killer, who, in a fictional subplot, involve a nightclub singer and the singer's dancer/wife in the group's mayhem.

The fictional subplot isn't strong, and doesn't really add to the story, but the great acting by Falk and his co-stars, including May Britt, Stuart Whitman, and Simon Oakland, plus the fact that this is essentially a true story, make Murder, Inc a fascinating look at the innerworkings of the earlier days of the Mafia.",1152921600,18,816,4.905797101449275
2520368,5,B000EHSVQY,"This is an interesting movie due to the casting of Peter Falk as the ice pick wielding Abe Reles.

This is a true story which is based on a book written by the main detective in the movie I guess.

It's a classic case of a nice guy (Joey) who gets involved with a bad crowd.  This brings tragedy on not only himself but those he loves.

Reles rapes Joey's wife but then later says to her ""If you're not sore I'm not sore.""

He also tells them later: ""I really like you kids.""

Mory Amsterdam gets the ice pick treatment I guess due to the quality of the jokes he was telling in a mob controlled night club.

Some casting agent eventually realized that maybe Peter Falk would be better cast as one of the good guys.

The casting of Falk later as Detective Columbo must certainly be one of the greatest casting decisions in history.

2520369,5,B000EHSVQY,"This film is a gripping account of the crime syndicate that terrorized the nation during the waning days of the Great Depression.  Filmed in black-and-white in a cinema verite style this film lays out the methodically brutal methods of the consortium that spread fear to the lawless and law abiding alike.  The film focuses on the crime empire of Lepke (David J. Stewart) and how he held his grip on power through his vicious subordinates.  None of his cronies was more brutal than Abe Reles, portayed here by Peter Falk in a volcanic film debut.  Falk is listed in a supporting role here but his aura elevates an already fine film to another level.  If you want to contrast Falk's work here I found it akin to that of Joe Pesci's portrayal of Tommy DeVito in ""Goodfellas"".  Stuart Whitman and May Britt play a young couple ensnared by circumstance as accomplices to Lepke.  Whitman and Britt, the film's ostensible stars, are kind of bland but do not detract from the overall power of this film.",1148601600,13,996,4.6571428571428575

2520381,3,B000EHSVQY,"I think of this tidy little mobster film a sort of companion to LEPKE.  Though it does contain some parts with Lepke B. in it, it deals mainly with
the character that Peter Falk plays, hit man for Murder Inc.  This is a good movie with a fine cast and story, though I thought it fell a little flat
with a quick and sudden ending; that is why I only gave  it 3 Stars.  But most gangster addicts will enjoy this.  There is somewhat less graphic
violence in it but the film does show the viciousness of this killing organization.  Like most films made around 1960, the cars, phones and costumes
are correct but for some reason the ladies look like 1960s ladies in 1930s clothes: same with THE UNTOUCHABLES TV shows.  LEPKE, however,
was more period-like accurate.  Still, Peter Falk portrayed his character well as a vicious nasty creepo bastard and not very nice either.  Anyhow,
I got my DVD from Amazon and the picture quality is very good with full 2:35 Cinemascope letter boxing which I prefer.  Enjoy!",1439769600,,1004,4.527777777777778

2520386,2,B000EHSVQY,"This movie has some strange choices. For one thing, it's shot in gritty b/w befitting a documentary-type approach. But then it's unnecessarily filmed in 2.35:1 CinemaScope. I say unnecessarily, because this is basically a story that contains a number of dramatic  vignettes between 2-5 characters. Kid Twist meets with Joey.  Joey meets with his wife. Joey's wife meets Kid Twist. Kid Twist meets with Lepke,  and so on and so on The meetings either take place in the gangsters office, a dressing room,  The District Attorney's  office and so on....none of which need to be shown in Cinemascope.  All that aside, there are also some strange casting choices.
There is no doubt that ""newcomer"" Peter Falk,  as the aforementioned Kid Twist steals the show. But he's only given like fourth or fifth billing. At the same time, Stuart Whitman, who's fine as a loser caught up in the events, is given top billing.  Second billing is given to May Britt, who  plays Whitman's  wife , and who is absolutely a terrible, strange-looking actress  and totally out of place for the time in which the story is supposed to be happening.

2520405,3,B000EHSVQY,"Peter Falk became so indelibly associated with the seemingly bumbling, self deprecating TV detective Columbo that many people forget (or are simply unaware) that he had a solid career as a dramatic film actor before that. Falk first gained public attention (and a well deserved Oscar nomination) as the vicious gangster Abe ""Kid Twist"" Reles in the based-on-fact mob expose, ""Murder, Inc.""

Released in 1960, ""Murder, Inc."" is the story of the infamous group of mob assassins of the same name organized by Louis ""Lepke"" Buchalter, the man who orchestrated the killing of Dutch Schultz. Buchalter hired freelance killers, usually lower level gangsters, and kept them on retainer so they would be available as needed. One of these hired killers was Abe Reles, a small time loan shark who moonlighted as one of Lepke's hit men. Eventually, Reles would turn state's evidence, and his testimony was instrumental in sending Lepke to the electric chair, making him the only major mob boss ever executed for murder.

""Murder, Inc."" is based on a book by Burton Turkus (played by Henry Morgan in the film), the assistant district attorney who turned Reles and convicted a number of Murder, Inc. killers. The book concentrated on Lepke, Reles, and the other mobsters Turkus encountered over the years. Peter Falk's portrayal of Abe Reles is perfect for the material. As played by Falk, Reles is a stone cold but very shrewd psycho, given to fits of rage, but also capable of turning on the charm on occasion. He easily dominates every scene he is in, playing a character somewhat similar to the one that would win Joe Pesci an Oscar decades later in ""Goodfellas.""

However, the film's producers, influenced by the highly successful TV series, ""The Untouchables,"" decided to shift the emphasis away from Reles and the deceptively mild mannered Lepke (nicely played by little known character actor David J. Stewart). Neither the bland Morgan nor the various cops in the movie are well suited in the protagonist role, so the film creates a fictional central character, Joey, a small time musician played by Stuart Whitman. Joey has a gambling problem and gets deeply in debt to Reles, who agrees to let Joey off the hook if the musician will serve as the getaway driver for some of Reles' killings. Joey's wife, Eadie (May Britt), a nightclub dancer, also attracts the attention of Reles and, later, Lepke. The film hints at the demands the gangsters make of Eadie, whose outspoken defiance threatens to get the couple in trouble.

Although Whitman is an underrated actor, the character of Joey is badly underwritten, and he lacks any spark with Britt. She has the requisite sex appeal, but not the acting skills for her role. As a result, the couple at the center of the movie have little chemistry together and lack the heft to carry the film, which, as a result, suffers badly whenever Reles is not on screen. Further, when Henry Morgan finally makes his appearance as Turkus two-thirds of the way through the movie, the action grinds to a near complete halt when it should be leading up to a climactic trial.

Another big problem with the movie is that the factual background of the movie is never made quite clear. It's obvious that Lepke, Reles, and the rest are dangerous, evil men, but the film glosses over many of the facts in the real case, including the nature of the intense two-year manhunt that went on for Lepke (who, in the film, was an unwelcome houseguest of Joey and Eadie for some unspecified period of time). An entire movie could have been centered on the effect Lepke had on the couple's relationship and the events that eventually induced him to surrender. Instead, the film merely reduces these events to about three scenes, only one of which (featuring Eadie trying to wait on Lepke but eventually having a temper tantrum) is effective.

""Murder, Inc."" isn't a great, or even a very good, mob film, but it isn't merely a showcase for Falk. The moody black-and-white cinematography fits the piece quite well, and the movie features a very rare appearance by the legendary Sarah Vaughan as a night club singer. Still, watching ""Murder, Inc."" won't give viewers much of a feel either for the real life gangsters portrayed in the movie or the American gangster movie. Although the movie looks and sounds good (and has some other nice supporting performances), there's still only one reason, albeit a very good reason, to see this movie, and that' s Peter Falk. In a better movie, his Abe Reles would be hailed as one of the best villainous performances of all time. Even in this average film, that performance is enough for me to recommend the movie.",1403827200,,4660,4.840652446675032

2520407,3,B000EHSVQY,"Definite late 1950/1960's--not the best era for movies (the music soundtrack is majorly irritating). Done in black and white, or more like grey--grey throughout the entire movie (black and white is colorless, but this is not only colorless, it is washed out). Stuart Whitman, May Britt, Henry Morgan and the first appearance in a movie of Peter Falk--An amazing performance that carried the movie (I have since learned he received an academy award nomination for best supporting actor). True story of crime developing into a nation wide syndicate and the federal response.
Mediocre, at best. Too bad because the potential to create an excellent movie is really there. This was an horrifically violent association that was genuinely murderous and controlling.
Again the very, very impressive first movie role by Peter Falk is worth seeing alone. Spectacular..

A comment was left stating this was not Falk's first movie. Wikipedia says (as of today, 10/30/2014) that this is his second). No matter, I stand by the rest of my opinion--Not an especially good movie but, Falk's performance was worthy of a award.",1393804800,,1108,5.155555555555556

2520411,3,B000EHSVQY,"Peter Falk, as Abe Reles, the main hit man for Murder, Inc., is the best thing about this run-of-the-mill crime drama.  He steals the movie out from under the, at the time, more established players, and got an Academy Award nomination in the process.  This movie laid the groundwork for the rest of his career in movies and TV, as he himself stated.  The movie itself is supposed to take place in the 1930s, but hairstyles and some of the clothing does not fit that time period.  For instance, May Britt's hairstyle looks like it came right out of the 1960s.  Ditto for Stuart Whitman.  One can almost forget that the action is supposed to take place nearly 3 decades before, until Falk arrives on the scene.  He looks and acts like he stepped right out of ""Little Caesar"" instead of this production.  He makes sparks fly just being on the screen, which makes him a standout.  I guess because of the time that this movie was filmed, the manner in which the real Reles did in his victims would have been too graphic.  Here, he uses his ice pick to stab victims in the ribs or gut.  The real Reles actually stabbed victims in the ear canal all the way into the brain, and he was so adept with the ice pick that he could make it appear to be a cerebral hemorrhage!  Movies produced today would probably show this, but we're talking about the 1960s here.  Buy it for Falk, and watch him chew up some scenery.",1380931200,,1404,4.374517374517374

2520435,3,B000EHSVQY,"By the arithmitic of this review's title, this flick gets a mean score of 3.  But, with its lame, leaky script, late-fifties look, and poorly paced direction, it can scarcely be considered good.  Peter Falk is so fantastic, however, that it's as if he wandered in from a top-notch film noir onto the set of some mousy, mob-themed musical. When May Britt's character blasts him with a what-are-you-doing-here plaint, many viewers may have wondered the same.  Falk plays a hooligan hired by a crime boss to carry out hits.  He's to be on retainer with a bonus for each ordered bump-off and will deal only with the big fellow's right-hand henchman (who looks like an accountant).  Yet Falk is surprised and dismayed that he can't get no respect from these guys, the mob's mouthpiece, or a punk's pushy wifey.  He pressures a reluctant, naive debtor (who was fool enough to pay hospital bills instead of Falk) into abetting a hit that could easily be made without him.  Yet Falk's performance is so mesmerizing that one can almost overlook these anomalies.  But when he's not around, the plot's poverty is painfully obvious.  Take, for instance, the casting and role of May Britt.  She's a refugee (from Sweden??) who, after a terrifying sexual encounter with one gangster, shuffles around another in sheer lingerie and dares to repeatedly cook his eggs wrong.  Maybe her marabou-trimmed peignoir was supposed to remind the audience of a moll's in real thirties mobster films, because nothing else in the women's hairstyles, makeup, or clothing does.  It's all reminiscent of earlier period films where, regardless of the century portrayed, actresses had pencil-thin eyebrows, short, curling-ironed coiffs, and slinky dresses.  Though black-and-white filmography should have imparted a certain element of stylistic grittiness, the movie possesses a sort of garishness that might cause a viewer to recall Britt's negligee as bright pink or her velvety sofa as sky blue.  The set holding the latter is one of the few spacious ones.  Some are oddly cramped, like the crime boss's waiting room, a neighborhood diner, and particulary the hotel rooms where stoolies are being held.  At least the shotgun-style diner is made interesting by Helen Waters as its noirishly fat proprietor.  Next to Falk, she's the most intriguing character in a movie dulled by intrusive narration, flat cop roles, and pace-breaking plot devices like Britt dancing, Morey Amsterdam telling jokes, and Sarah Vaughan singing one whole number.  The soundtrack of her obviously pre-recorded song doesn't even match her mouth movements!",1248480000,5,2600,5.164677804295943
2520436,4,B000EHSVQY,"Those who say that Peter Falk elevated this movie to a very interesting one are right on the money. Falk, in his first role on screen, definitely plays the most interesting character. Of course, anyone who is a deranged killer is likely to be the focus of viewers' attentions. However, the actor still has to be convincing and Falk does a fine job here as ""Abe Reles.""

What made this film fun for me was not only Falk, but seeing a few other faces I haven't seen in years, such as May Britt, Henry Morgan and Stuart Whitman. Having watched a few ""Night Stalker"" TV episodes, I was still very familiar with Simon Oakland. The above actors were all very good in here, as was the rest of the cast, except maybe David Stewart as head crime boss ""Lepke."" He was too bland for his role of that famous crook.

We even get a song from a young Sarah Vaughan and a comedy routine from Morey Amsterdam! Isn't that strange in a movie about the brutal Murder, Inc., gang?

Shot in documentary style, ""Murder, Inc."" is long on talk and short on action.  For a movie concerning an association of hit men, it comes as an unwelcome surprise that there would be so little action, so few murders.

This movie is based on an interesting true story in 1930s Brooklyn, but it lacks juice, and for a movie with the title ""Murder, Inc.,"" such a dearth is the kiss of death.  When you see a film title with the word ""murder"" teamed with ""inc."" in it, it stands to reason that you would expect to see a raft of murders being committed on-screen.  ""Murder, Inc.,"" which is a catchy title, is therefore misleading.

What the film does have is a standout performance by Peter Falk as contract killer Abe Reles, which is spot on, and, for that reason alone, if for no other, it is worth watching.

2520439,3,B000EHSVQY,"Murder, Inc. (1960) is worth renting as a DVD, for the simple reason that
it shows the ugliness of murder, rubouts, contract killings in a Post-Prohibition
era, during which various gangs cooperated in a national syndicate, for profit
maximization as opposed to rival gangs competing for the same turf.

In fact, the gangs now prefer taking the low key approach, staying off the radar screen of
law enforcement. The biggest profit generators the movies suggests, are shakedowns of the
management of a company, by micromanaging the labor unions and their ability to strike and
hold the company hostage for a large pay increase unless the underworld is used to mitigate
the union's greed, or so they say. Another one, is the protection money required
from shopkeepers, under the risk of retaliation and complete destruction of their livelihood
(  of the actual productive assets and inventory) should they refuse and resist payment.

This work is completely non-glossy in terms of a film, as it shows the underbelly of crime,
and the actual implications of taking part in the underworld, once the gang draws the
attention of law enforcement and the top bosses rub out their own helping hands, to avoid
being connected with the dastardly deeds they ordered be carried out.

One of the few artistic merits of their work, is the clarity, sharpness and good editing
coupled with the great wide-screen release, while the story itself (the script) is mixed
with a sentimental love story (perhaps not grounded in reality) to keep viewers interested
despite  the hard hitting facts. Clearly, this movie was intended  as an ""educational tool""
 by the police, to discourage crime and enlighten youth from partaking in profit generating
but illegal behavior.

Centered in Brooklyn, NY in the 1930's,  the film is modern except for the telephones, and
automobiles shown, whereas the rest has stood the test of time.

The protagnonist, Falk, is an enigma, as sometimes he appears aloof,  like a sitting duck
or Momma's Boy,  but at other times, able to transform himself as a hard hitting criminal,
keen to violence,  even to ruthlessness and generosity so long as it suits his agenda, even
rape. His oversized coat draws away from the movie's credibility, as it looks it just came
off the clothes rack, spotless, no dust.

It also  gives horse betting and pawnshop keepers a bad name, as shylocking and betting is
condoned.

The movie is also brave, in terms of the mini skirts of the dancing girls shown on screen,
as the gangsters enjoy the entertainment of night clubs as well as crooners and the girls.

The story is valuable in showing how peer and economic pressures can sometimes push an
honest but vulnerable man to get involved in criminal activities, even when simply driving
or cooperating on a contract, vs. pulling the trigger.

For those familiar with the hierarchy found in the military, that of the underworld
syndicate is much alike, in the expectation of taking orders from the top without asking
questions, and respecting higher ranked individuals in the movement.

The psychology of criminals is also portrayed as that of  greedy individuals, who are
unable  to tame their desires and impulses. Falk yells "" Whatever I want, I take! That's
what hands are for! To take!""

Bizarrely, the script is critical and mocking of showgirls as  worthy housewives, as they
can't cook, (boil an egg), dress themselves decently or even maintain an interesting
conversation. It also associates those characteristics with  women from European countries,
who arrive to the USA, as opposed to home grown USA women.

Overall, the story tells how 200 murders in 2 years were committed in Brooklyn alone, by a
small gang for maximizing their underworld revenue generation operations.

The story touches slightly on the law, in terms of Habeas Corpus, and corroborating
witnesseses and subpoenas and the like - needed in preparation of a court date,  and how,
at the end of the day, st00l pigeons are a gang's archilles heel.",1214352000,,4009,4.998493975903615

8110121,3,B000EHSVQY,"Sort of defines the word ""dud."" Three stars is probably a bit generous, but the third one is for Peter Falk. This was his acting debut, and he's excellent; his performance would be better remembered if it was a better movie. It's not very good. It's short but still seems to drag in the second half, the violence is a bit tame compared to what's become common now, and the story doesn't quite make enough sense. The best thing about it is Falk.

There are a lot of good things in it (a song by Sarah Vaughan, an interesting cast, good cinematography), but the ending is unsatisfying (we never even find out whodunit) and the writing is so-so at best. The whole thing just never gels. I did watch it all the way through, but I don't recommend it and I'd never watch it again.",1473465600,,774,4.337931034482758
