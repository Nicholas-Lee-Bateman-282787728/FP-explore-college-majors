7857705,5,6303935621,"This video is an awesome resource for ballet students.  It is very enjoyable to watch profesional dancers do steps perfectly as in a class.  The only thing wrong with it is, if your school does not teach the Balanchine method, the video might disagree with some things, but other than that...excellent!!!
