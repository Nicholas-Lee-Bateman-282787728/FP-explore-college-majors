8064414,4,B0009OW1N6,"Sherlock Holmes Classics Triple Feature

These movies were adapted from the Sherlock Holmes stories written by A. Conan Doyle from 1887 to 1890s. These stories have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories (are always worth reading), but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of the era. Read the individual reviews for more information, each movie uses a different actor for Holmes.

Murder at the Baskervilles [1937] is about the murder of a horse trainer and the loss of Silver Blaze. Did the dog bark in the night? Holmes recovers the lost horse and the murderer. Arthur Wontner plays Holmes.

Dressed to Kill [1946] is about stolen music boxes. One has an engraved plate that can be used to print counterfeit 5 notes that cant be distinguished from genuine 5 notes!
