257256,3,6300208931,"If you wanna save some bucks buying the regular DVD of this police potboiler instead of the Blu-Ray, do so. I'm beginning to wonder about Olive Film's ""prestige"" approach. Their Blu-Rays are not up to snuff if you ask me. The image here is kinda inky and (at times) rather grainy. Also, this was one of those Academy aperture-widescreen hybrids from the mid Fifties where they chopped the top and the bottom of the image and then blew it up to fit on the ""new"" wide screen look, so you get these cramped images that surely were not the intention of director Don Siegel. The movie is okay, but should have been a double feature that you can get at the discount stores for about $5 and not a penny more.",1387238400,,701,4.358778625954199
257257,5,6300208931,"This film is almost an independent production for RKO.  Two cops take some stolen money and hide it in a trailer that becomes their ""private hell #36.""  One cop is a family man and wants to return it to the police.  The other is a bon vivant and wants to spend it on Lupino.  Which way will it go becomes the dilemma!  A nice, neat little noir from a promising woman director.

257259,3,6300208931,"Ida Lupino co-authored the screenplay, co-produced the film and is the only reason to get on board with this underproduced and dully directed picture. It is enough. She is alluring and dynamic holding not only the screen but the entire picture together. The supporting cast, Steve Cochran, Howard Duff and Dean Jagger are all more than adequate in their perfunctory way. Dorothy Malone, co-starred but barely in the picture, registers in her brief part as Duff's on-screen wife.

257261,4,6300208931,"Would make a perfect double feature with DOUBLE INDEMNITY.

A man in NYC is murdered and robbed of $300,000 in marked money.  A year later some of the bills start showing up in Los Angeles.  Detectives Bruner and Farnum are assigned to follow the money trail.  It leads to lounge singer Ida Lupino and eventually tension and backstabbing between the two partners.

It might not be action-packed, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The acting is top-notch.  The story is interesting and hard-boiled.  The direction by Don Siegel - who'd later go on to direct DIRTY HARRY- is excellent with numerous scenes shot on city streets and the horse track (I loved watching the crowd and seeing the old cars).  Any fan of classic film noir and older crime movies should have this in their collection.  If it came out on DVD I'd buy it in a second.

257323,3,6300208931,"Good minor noir.  Ida Lupino shines throughout.  What comes through is what an intelligent actress she was.  It is no surprise that she excelled as a director and screenwriter in other noir features.  She definitely was a pioneer for women in Hollywood. The other actors in the film were very good.  The theme of corrupt cops is a touchy subject that was often handled very well in films in the 1940's and 1050's.  Somehow today we have become very timid as a culture in acknowledging that criminal behavior and corruption exist in our nation's police force.  I'm not sure this film could be made today.  Any criticism of the police today is seen as supporting criminals.  As a society, this would be a big mistake.  As the film shows, we are all vulnerable to temptation and greed.  I wish today we could feel free enough to make these kind of films.",1445731200,3,851,4.569536423841059

I wish the ending had a moment with Ida Lupino (no Ida movie is bad!), but some dubious editing left the ending rather odd.  The buildup of the plot works well, and the actors are fine, but the movie leaves something to be desired.  The film quality is excellent considering the age, audio and video reasonably clean.  All in all, worth it, but not up to the best noir or even the best Don Seigal (Director).",1443916800,,528,4.5638297872340425

One of the cops can't resist helping himself to some of the cash and he talks the other into participating.  From there on other investigators get closer and closer to the truth and there's death for one of the guys.

257387,4,6300208931,"While investigating a robbery, detectives Cal Bruner (Steve Cochran) and Jack Farnham (Howard Duff) attempt to track down the man who used a certain $50 bill. This bill came from a previous robbery and murder. Bruner and Farnham enlist the help of Lilli Marlowe (Ida Lupino), a woman who received the fateful fifty as a tip from the killer at a local bar. This leads the detectives to stake out a horse track. It also leads to romance for Bruner and Marlowe! The stake-out pays off when the prime suspect shows up and leads our heroes on a chase, resulting in the crook's fatal crash. The two cops soon discover that the assailant's wrecked car is loaded w/ stolen money! Bruner decides to help himself to several stacks of the illegal tender, while Farnham wants to do the right thing and turn it in. A moral dilemma ensues. Farnham feels the pressure to share in the money, since his wife (Dorothy Malone) has been hassling him to get a less dangerous job. Plus, they've got a new baby to support. Of course, his conscience won't allow him to do anything so criminal. Meanwhile, Bruner seems blissfully unaffected by guilt or concern. The tension builds between Bruner and Farnham, leading to an inevitable conclusion. PRIVATE HELL 36 is a fable wrapped in a cops 'n' robbers veneer. Co-stars Dean Jagger as Captain Michaels.

Dorothy Malone stands out as Howard Duff's loving wife - to me, one of the most well acted roles.  A bit of a twist at the end, the movie felt brief.

7806280,4,6300208931,"The ambitious, foxy and emancipated Ida Lupino, acting in UK films from 1931 on and directing in Hollywood from 1949, wrote, and unassumingly stars in, this 1954 indie Filmakers project produced and intelligently co-written with her former spouse Collier Young. The director is Don Siegel, already established in features from 1946 and here confidently and cleanly perfecting his artistry between RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 and INVASON OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. The film, very much a family affair, ropes in Lupino's new spouse Howard Duff, the acting debut of daughter Bridget Duff, and David Sam Peckinpah had an early stint as dialogue director, a generation later memorably directing chum Lupino in his great rodeo elegy JUNIOR BONNER.

The smart script, personally customized for Lupino, Cochran and Duff, is talkier than most Siegel films, and Ida has the majority of wistful one-liners and witticisms, reprising her ROAD HOUSE role as a weary nighttime saloon singer. Her character has tired eyes, hurting in unaccustomed daylight, chronically tired feet in strappy pumps, and a goodly array of tired-singer's strapless 1954 frocks. Ms. Ida does great things with a single small prop, a cigarette holder, the slender but meaty plot hinging upon the Macguffin of her having sung ""Smoke gets in your eyes"" to a shady, big-tipping, admirer. The Young-Lupino scenario alludes, in a coy and prescient reference to DRAGNET, to this offscreen filmmaker's inevitable future as a reliable director of series television.

PH 36 is less a (mostly daylit) noir than an LAPD procedural, with good opportunities for Siegel to go outside to Inglewood's Hollywood Park Racetrack and to stage a nifty copcar chase sequence into the hills, with a car wreck and hot $50 bills temptingly wafting in the smoggy breeze. Duff is married to glam hausfrau Dorothy Malone (squandered here, but possessing a great spaghetti-sauce recipe and a wobbly coffeetable), and Lupino has sassy dialogue interactions with her unlikely co-star Steve Cochran--who (true to Siegel form in empowering lesser actors) is really outstanding here. Cochran and Duff, as professional partners, have an interesting bromance gestating alongside their interests in Malone and Lupino, and the script explicitly acknowledges this complication. Because of the good taste and intelligence of the Youngs, this is noir lite, more civilized and formal than usual and for maturer filmgoers.

The Olive Films transfer is bright and clear, emphasizing Burnett Guffey's straightforward cinematography (all four name stars, even Cochran, have really luminous closeups in this ensemble film) and Siegel's usual spot-on editing of the assembled images. The film works agreeably on every level--as a very distinctive Siegel film, a Lupino-Cochran movie, a Filmakers' insider vanity project--as long as you don't mistakenly prejudge it as just a talky pseudonoir or as a lower-budget B-picture.",1473379200,,2927,5.428571428571429
7806281,5,6300208931,"Ida Lupino must have been one of the most broadly talented women ever to favor Hollywood with her labors -- acting, directing, writing (as per the shared credit she gets for this script), even a passable lounge singer as in this film and another I remember called ""Road House.""  Here she's a hard-boiled entertainer who succumbs to a seeming chance at happiness only to find . . . well, Howard Duff and Steve Cochran register well as cop teammates who can't seem to think through the effects of their next moves.  Dorothy Malone is always fine, and this is a great chance to see other old pros like Dean Jagger as the guys' police boss.
