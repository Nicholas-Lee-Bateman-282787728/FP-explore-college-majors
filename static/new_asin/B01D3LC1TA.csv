8754800,5,B01D3LC1TA,"Having just acquired a new large screen TV, I have recently been expanding my collection of Opera on Blu Ray to take advantage of my home theatre setup.  I had purchased, and was recently disappointed by a production of La Boheme at the Royal Opera Chorus.  Despite its multiple Five-Star reviews on Amazon, I found the voices of the lead singers wanting, although it was an otherwise satisfying production.

Pressing on, I noticed this production of La Boheme at the Puccini Festival in Torre del Lago.  Despite the lack of reviews at the time I ordered it, I was heartened to see that the production was staged by noted Italian director Ettore Scola, who is a favorite of mine.  Based on his reputation alone, I decided to take the plunge.  I am glad that I did.

The principal singers, Daniela Dessi and Fabio Armiliato were not only capable, they excelled at the starring roles.  Particularly Mr. Armiliato, who vocally reminded me of a young Begonzi.  The singing was more than adequate; I was thrilled to hear the parts of Rodolfo and Mimi sung with great gusto and clarity, as they were by the stars here.  In addition, there was not a bad voice among the supporting cast and, in particular, the roles of Musetta, Marcello and especially Colline were both professional and satisfying.

At the end, I found I had thoroughly enjoyed this production.  Absolutely recommended.",1491609600,7,1379,4.796610169491525
