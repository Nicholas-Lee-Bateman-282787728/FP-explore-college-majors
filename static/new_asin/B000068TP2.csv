8176120,5,B000068TP2,"This movie is about a woman who is like all humanity should be.  She is a great life figure who we should all take after, if we ever want a better world.  She is unselfish to the core, and puts humanity first.  She is the inspiration for the nobel peace prize.  If not for her presence that humanitarian prize would not exist.  It was her influence upon Alfred Nobel (the one for whom the prize was name after) that instilled goodness and grace within him.  This film should really be named for her.  See it whenever you want a shot of dignity, and grace and the courage to fight against overwhelming odds.  We need films like this today with all the trash that's out there.  This film is an inspiration!  As soon as I saw it the first time , I saw it again.  What ever you do don't miss this one.",1221091200,5,797,4.177631578947368
