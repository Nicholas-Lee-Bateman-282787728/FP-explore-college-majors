4397210,4,B004KNO2VQ,"I thought this was a very good action movie and a nice surprise for a genre that can be over commercial and dull.  The story is extreamly  well told and development of characters is excellent.
I would certainly recommend it.  One of the better action movies I have seen in a long time.  The extra bonus is the French scenery.",1321833600,,325,4.366666666666666
4397211,3,B004KNO2VQ,"This is a French crime thriller which has borrowed a bit from the `Die Hard' franchise. It tells the story of trainee nurse Samuel Pierret (Gilles Lellouche), whose wife is very heavily pregnant. One night a man is taken into the Hospital after he has suffered a stomach laceration and been run over by a (quite fast) motorbike. He is on a ventilator, and not in a good way. Someone cuts the life saving tube and he starts to suffocate. Samuel spots it just in time and saves the mans life.

That was a big mistake; this guy is a wanted high calibre thief - Hugo Sartet (Roscidy Zem). His compatriots have followed Samuel home and then decide to take his wife hostage and force him to `spring' their boss. Samuels wife has been told she is in danger of losing the baby and has to spend the rest of her pregnancy lying down, so this brutal interruption sends Sam a bit desperate. He  decides to do all it takes to get her back.

He goes back into work (after a night shift) and puts a rather crude plan into operation, meanwhile the Gendarmes have taken fingerprints from the unknown guy and are heading back to ask some pesky questions. The cops are also investigating the murder of an uber rich business guy, but are the matters linked?

Well this tries to avoid formulaic plot developments, and has some brilliant touches. I liked the French police driving Alfa Romeos. There is an however, and that is the number of plot holes. If you just go with the flow, then this is an excellent action movie, with full throttle action, double crosses and plot twists, but the contrivances just took something away for me.

I am a big fan of World Cinema and especially love European Cinema and I think Director Fred Cavaye has done an above average job, but some of the artifice he uses means that this is hard to take that seriously. If you want to suspend belief for 84 mins, with full on action, some blood and guts and some really rather good performances from all involved, then this will tick your boxes, if you thought `Anything For Her' was a bit of a stretch, then best to avoid.",1320192000,2,2080,4.43455497382199

4397220,4,B004KNO2VQ,"This has nothing to do with the classic Lee Marvin movie of the same name: there is nothing enigmatic or deep about it at all.  Basically, it's the story of a home and (very pregnant) wife loving everyman who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time as all hell breaks loose with him in the middle!  How he tries to extricate himself from this `unfortunate' situation forms the basis of the plot, which is full of criminal nasties and crooked cops so it's a job for him and us to know exactly who can be trusted!

Despite being slightly clichd, it's a brilliantly made thrill a minute movie which manages to be engaging, entertaining and oddly humorous - in parts!",1376438400,,674,4.419354838709677

4397222,5,B004KNO2VQ,"Love the film, saw it in theaters. This blu-ray disc will not play at all on my Panasonic DMP BD80 player! I exchanged it for another copy & still will not play at all. Player cannot read it. Have latest firmware updates. My BD player plays all my hundreds of other BDs!

Contacted; Magnolia, they said they'd research it & get back to me & have not after 1 week. Contacted Panasonic & no reply. Tried the 1st disc on a Sony BDP S185 at a store & it played!

My 1st thought was a factory defect in the disc. I still haven't ruled that out entirely. Just as some players can deal with scratches better than other players, some may be able to play despite an error in the disc. I still have not heard of a reasonable explanation for why all other BDs play just fine & only this one will not load. Dirty spindle, bad laser, bad mechanical drive explanations don't seem correct as that should cause problems with ANY disc.

Update:
Months later had 2 other BDs fail to load! Ended up buying a new BD player (Oppo) The Movie played just fine. Highly recommend this BD!",1367625600,,1063,4.278606965174129
4397223,2,B004KNO2VQ,"This is my second Fred Cavaye film. I like watching a French movie with English subtitles, but this film had little character development, just hundreds of people who look the same running in all directions. I can't recommend it.",1366070400,,229,4.897435897435898
4397224,4,B004KNO2VQ,"I love a really good crime-thriller and this is about as good of one as I've ever seen.

Here's the scoop. Sam works at a hospital. He's inches away from becoming a certified nurse. His wife, whom he loves dearly, is pregnant but must take it easy to avoid complications. One night he's helping on a case where a man has been hit by a motorcycle. Next thing you know his wife is kidnapped and he has only hours to deliver the accident victim or she's history. Now he's teamed up with the accident victim, who might be a murderer, and way over his head in a complicated situation that might involve dirty cops. What to do?

This has a similar look and feel to the ""Bourne"" films. It runs at breakneck speeds with little time out. The music score is also reminiscent of ""Bourne."" The plot turns quickly, but the turns don't seem forced. They all seem natural to the situation. It builds up a fever pitch and, like a Hitchcock film, you wonder how our hero will ever make it out of the mess. Yup. There are some filthy cops, but one female detective, who smells something fishy, is on hand to help even things out. And when you think they can't turn the knot any tighter, they somehow manage to. This one comes down to the wire. There were some elements, and at least one stunt, that were lifted from other movies which is a shame being that everything else seems so fresh. Had those not reared their heads I might have given this the big five stars.

Be that as it may, this is a heck of a romp. It has it all and then some. If you're into this type of flick, this will serve up a seven course meal for you.",1364774400,3,1605,4.221498371335505

4397226,4,B004KNO2VQ,"PLOT SPOILER!

It is a fairly fast paced thriller.  Instead of the standard car chases, the director substituted foot races through Paris buildings and the Metro.  This was a novel idea and definitely holds your attention.

The best part of the film is at the end when our hero, who is wanted by the police and the police intend to shoot-to-kill, has to break into the crowded police station and escape with his pregnant wife.

How in the hell does he do that when his face is on every poster, on every floor?

Yeah, that's worth the price of the film.",1354320000,,552,4.415841584158416
4397227,4,B004KNO2VQ,"This French film (with English subtitles) was relatively action packed albeit with only one vehicular crash and several chase scenes.  Unlike Hollywood, it required good writing and cinematography to carry the day.  See if you can track down the trailer first and decide for yourself.  The film runs about 1:45 and may work for you if you can either speak French or enjoy foreign film.  You will find violence, some harsh language and a relatively formulaic plot. That said, if you enjoy action/adventure, this one should fill the bill.",1353110400,2,536,4.98876404494382

4397229,4,B004KNO2VQ,"My short review...

A predictable good guy in the wrong place, now I have to rescue my wife and save myself from the dirty cops, Mel Gibson/Harrison Ford'ish, crime drama.  Fairly well acted, action packed, with a good pace. Had a fairly gritty, dark feel to it.  It certainly didn't keep you guessing and it ended in a very familiar sort of way, however I guess it was worth a watch before bed.  Yawn.

4397235,5,B004KNO2VQ,Saw this French film at the movies last year and knew I wanted to buy it in the first 5 minutes. Begins explosively and never lets up. And still able to establish character and relationships amidst the relentless forward momentum of the plot and non-stop action. Don't worry about reading subtitles - this one is a winner! Highly recommend Point Blank!!,1327449600,,353,4.80327868852459
4397236,5,B004KNO2VQ,"This movie shows that someone else besides Hollywood knows how to make an action movie. I saw the movie with my wife who is notoriously averse to violent movies but thoroughly enjoyed this one. It is good enough that I purchased the DVD to add to my permanent collection. The action starts in the first seconds and does not quit until the end credits. This movie is notably effective in that there is no gratuitous violence and the violence that there is, is entirely logical and minimal related directly to the story. That is not to say that the story itself is somewhat of a stretch but that is the way of most engaging action movies. It is the story of a common man involved by chance in a much larger sequence of events involving criminal actions by certain police officers and criminal elements. Beyond that I would not like to give away any more of the story. My advice is to purchase it or arrange to,see it for yourself, you will be well rewarded if you enjoy this genre.",1325894400,3,979,4.444444444444445
4397237,4,B004KNO2VQ,"Smart action thrillers are rare. Rarer still is a smart action thriller that features a complex yet comprehensible (and credible) plot, characters you care about, and vivid, crisp directing. ""Point Blank"" is one of these rarities. It utilizes many elements of classic action films--an innocent ""good guy"" who unwittingly becomes caught up in a dangerous plot, a woman in jeopardy, corrupt cops, and unexpected twists. The film avoids clich, however, and it moves along at lightning speed (total running time is about 80 minutes). The French setting is an added bonus. Subtract a star if subtitles annoy you.",1324771200,15,607,5.204081632653061
4397238,5,B004KNO2VQ,This is a little known gem of a thriller.  The reviews don't do it justice.  A wild roller coaster of an entertaining film.  A must buy for the collector of modern action films.,1323993600,,177,4.303030303030303
4397239,4,B004KNO2VQ,You can tell that the writer and director spent a fair amount of time on details which to me is an accurate indicator of quality. The storyline of an inadvertent citizen being drawn into a bit of criminal and police conspiracy intrigue has been done before but this film had enough twists to that story that it was still engaging. It had a nice flow to the action - not excessive and overly stereotypic in the chase scenes. Acting was passably OK but kudos to the cinematography to keep the whole experience feel really close to the viewer. A few parts seemed a bit too unlikely but not excessively so.,1323820800,2,602,4.4818181818181815

""Point Blank"" (""A Bout Portant"")
(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
This French action-thriller comes solidly out of the average-guy-caught-in-the-middle-of-a-violent-world-of-crime genre that American stars like Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis have headlined for years. The plot isn't particularly original: a schnookish assistant nurse runs afoul of a criminal organization when he saves the life of a patient they had earlier tried to kill. His pregnant wife gets kidnapped, and the kidnappers demand that he do what they tell him to... Well, you know the drill.  What's different here is the realistic tone of the violence, often crude and brutish, but stylish and cool when it makes sense, and always with a palpable believability that is often lacking in American shoot-em-ups.  The casting is also great, lots of interesting, unusual faces and several strong performances, especially Gilles Lellouche as the hero, Roschdy Zem as his unwilling criminal ally, and Spanish actress Elena Anaya as a tough, tomboyish cop, adding another triumph to her long string of stunning performances in European film (see also: ""Mesrine,"" ""The Skin I Live In"" and ""Talk To Her"") Not a terribly original script, but a very good, well-directed action film. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1323216000,15,1380,5.895
4397241,5,B004KNO2VQ,"Point Blank is an example of how a movie is this genre should be written.  Using a premise that has been used many times, that of an everyday individual thrown into a situation well out of the norm of his everyday life, having to respond to save something important to him. Crisply written, intelligent and exciting. The wholesale suspension of belief explained as artistic license required for most films in this genre is for the most part unnecessary in this movie.  And that just adds to the ability to relate to and sympathize with the protagonist.  Bravo!",1322870400,28,560,4.752577319587629

8433142,5,B004KNO2VQ,"Point Blank (&Agrave; bout portant) is a great French action thriller with a lot of great chase scenes, mostly on foot which is a nice change and a lot more realistic to the normal car chase movie style.  Basically we start the film with a guy being chased, we assume those after him want him dead, he somehow runs into a road tunnel and comes off second best.  An orderly working in the hospital notices someone beside his bed who shouldn't be there, he shouts out and the guy runs off having already severed the guy's life support system.  At home the guy starts bragging about being a hero  and that the victim would surely be dead without him only to realise he and his screaming heavily pregnant wife are not alone in their apartment.  When he awakens to a ringing mobile phone, he is told he must get the victim out of the hospital, if he fails or calls the cops, she'll be killed.

It's a good film because there aren't other than the orderly and his wife any good people in the film, no matter if they're working with or against the orderly and his goal to get his wife back.  It is a little bit far fetched especially the final showdown venue. A female bad cop and a good cop have been cast by actors who look exactly the same, wear their hair the same.  At one point your thinking, hang on isn't she the one.... how can she be there?  But other than that, Point Break is a great film.
