7967941,5,B00006FDB4,"I first watched Hookers on Point as a teen. I've always liked the women's stories about how they became prostitutes because it shows that these women aren't immoral or loose, but women who've had to make tough life decisions.  I was one of those people who wondered why these women couldn't just get a ""regular job."" Watching this film, and others like, it made me realize why many men and women need help getting away from prostitution. Between the quick cash, not having legal job skills, and drug use, it's no wonder that many people stay.

My only negative thoughts about the documentary is the pimps. I've never seen the necessity for those people because all they seem to do is take the prostitutes cash, and nothing more. The women with pimps seemed to be in harms ways just as much, if not more so, than the ones without pimps!",1430784000,,835,4.56
7967942,4,B00006FDB4,It's probably the most accurate depiction of street walkers that was ever produced. They did seem  to focus on the drug addicted prostitutes more than others.,1421366400,,158,5.076923076923077
7967943,5,B00006FDB4,"This documentary is raw and unapologetic. In no way does it glamorize prostitution. Rather it humanizes it through thoughtful insight and graphic tales from life on the street.

This is my personal favorite documentary ever made and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

A definite must see.",1408060800,,302,5.02
7967944,4,B00006FDB4,"Directed by Brent Owens, ""Hookers at the Point"" is a documentary of the extensive street prostitution at Hunts Point, the Bronx, over the course of several years. Located in South Bronx, Hunts Point is an impoverished industrial area known for its prostitution traffic.  The movie was produced for and originally shown on HBO.

The film is hard-hitting.  It features extensive interviews with several women who offer what appear to be candid observations about their lives, fears, and motivations. Virtually all the women in the film become involved in prostitution through drugs. Owens followed the women over a course of years and interviews them at different times, following-through on their street lives. The film also describes and interviews some of the pimps who control the women's lives.

In addition to the interviews, this film is brutal, realistic and gritty. It shows the streets, diners, industrial areas, and deserted places in Hunts Point, focusing on the ""stroll"" where most of the women solicit customers. The movie includes extensive scenes of the trafficking itself and of women soliciting their prospective customers driving by in cars and trucks. Sexual activity between a woman and her customer is depicted in cars and streets, replete with sound but no graphics. The film captures dramatically the squalor and danger of the street sex trade. It also shows well the humanity and tragedy of the women. The documentary is sad and depressing, as befitting its subject.

The film has had a substantial history. Some years after its release, HBO agreed to the request of a Hunts Point community association to stop showing the film on grounds that the area had taken large strides in cutting back on street prostitution. Apparently, the trade still flourishes at Hunts Point, but to a reduced extent.

The film has been the source of rap songs and other incidents of popular culture. There have been attempts to follow-up on the lives of some of the women portrayed in the movie who made strong impressions. In 2012, the New York newspapers wrote that one of the women portrayed in the film was, at the age of 52, continuing to work the Hunts Point streets and was about to retire. And all too rarely, some of the drug-plagued troubled young women shown in the film have apparently been able to move on, raise a family, and lead a stable life. This is the exception rather than the rule.

""Hookers at the Point"" offers a lurid, convincing look at street prostitution in a large American city. The DVD of the movie appears to be out-of-print, but the film is readily accessible on media.

7967945,5,B00006FDB4,I HAVE SEEN THIS DOCUMENTARY AND ALL THE PARTS THAT FOLLOW IT (AMAZON YOU MUST GET THEM ALL!) AND IT WAS A VERY SAD BUT INSPRIRATIONAL THING TO SEE. IT TELLS ALL THE DANGERS AND DISADVANTAGES IN THAT LIFESTYLE AND IF I HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS GETTING A BIT ON THE WILD SIDE I WOULD SIT HER DOWN AND HAVE HER WATCH THIS.  SHE'LL THINK TWICE ABOUT THOSE STREETS IF SHE HAD ANY KIND OF CONSCIOUS AFTER WATCHING THIS. BRAVO!!!,1141862400,13,421,4.197530864197531
7967946,1,B00006FDB4,"No, I didn't see it.  NO ... I wouldn't see it.

I'm from the South Bronx and have seen the females at Hunts Point and in Manhattan.  Why are these women so glamorized in the media; they don't look glamorous at all!  I wonder why men patronize such unattractive women at all ... there's lot of ""free love"" from better looking females.",1130112000,3,334,4.338709677419355
7967947,4,B00006FDB4,"The only reason why I don't give this five stars is because it is so depressing.  On the one hand, it was enjoyable to see prostitutes that are proud of their work and are willing to go on camera and admit that.  On the other hand, however, this movie implies that the women do it only to raise money to score drugs.  Though the interviewees seem not to know it, one phenomenon causes the other and a viscious cycle is taking place.

Still, things in this movie are hilarious!  One prostitute calls anyone she doesn't like a ""pooput""!  One boyfriend of a female prostitute admitted that he'd have sex with men if he could make money for drugs through it.  The documentary is narrated by a man who has a Barry White-ish, low, stereotypical pimp's voice.

This was sad, but highly enjoyable.  Do try to see it and form your own opinion.",1114819200,20,834,4.434210526315789
