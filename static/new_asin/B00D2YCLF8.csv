5769424,2,B00D2YCLF8,"Let me start off by saying that I have many of Jillians workouts and her previous yoga dvd is one of my all time favorites. This one just seems like a bunch of disjointed moves. Yes it does have some ""yoga"" in it, but there were plank jacks and standing jacks to get the heart rate up. In the first dvd I liked the fact that the heartrate was raised while in yoga poses. To be honest I have only made it through about 15 minutes of the first one, but I am just not into it at all. And I pre-ordered this one because I was so looking forward to it. Guess I will have to try the second one another day, but in my opinion this should not have been called any type of yoga workout, even in its very loosest definition.",1379721600,7,714,3.9652777777777777
5769425,4,B00D2YCLF8,"As an avid Jillian follower, and as one who has done the P90X series, I liked this workout of Jillian's.  She recommends 3-5lb weights; I used 7lbs which was a challenge, especially for the superman/angel move.  I was working and sweating so I'm happy.  I will throw this workout in the mix for sure!",1379462400,2,300,4.518518518518518
5769426,2,B00D2YCLF8,"This undoubtedly is a good workout but calling this yoga is pushing the envelope. There are elements of yoga positions used in this but it's more of a modified aerobics workout pretending to be a Vinyasa session. I'll use it for the cardio exercise it was ""meant"" for and not try to pretend this is actually ""yoga."" The other thing that's a bit irritating is Jillian herself. I wish she'd shut up and do the moves herself with a voice over. Her shouting voice doesn't work for me. If anyone is looking for a really good Vinyasa cardio yoga trainer/teacher, try Shiva Rea ""Daily Energy"" or her ""Power Flow Yoga."" You'll get a REAL yoga teacher with 20+ years of training and you'll find your cardio, stretching and balance that those who follow yoga understand.",1379376000,8,760,4.637037037037037
5769427,3,B00D2YCLF8,"I have 13 Jillian DVDs - needless to say, I'm a fan, without a doubt. I did a 'test drive' on this one after I finished 2 P90X workouts today, so I was pretty spent already. But she definitely had me sweating, and my HRM indicated I burned 250+ calories with workout #1 (5'6"", 132 lbs). My biggest complaint is that she does a horrible job of queuing for the next moves. I do many yoga DVDs, but when I am bent over in half staring at my knees, and she tells me to grab my toes and move into monkey stretch, I gotta say, I had to stop and unfold so I could watch her. Over time, queuing will become less important, but just starting out with the DVD, it is definitely lacking, compared to her other DVDs. And even though I know she explained it, the sunglasses are still ridiculous...  But I love you Jillian, and will rely on you to kick my booty again and again!",1379376000,10,864,4.112426035502959
5769428,4,B00D2YCLF8,"I am NOT a yoga fan, never have been.  However, I am trying new things and hoping to get rid of my unintentional hatred of things that I once found to be ""not my thing.""  So.... needless to say I was excited that Jillian was releasing a new yoga dvd.  I had purchased ""Yoga Meltdown"" when it first came out and unfortunately I found it to be absolutely horrible!  I tried to stick it out, but it just was awful.  I own every single Jillian DVD and that was by far the worst.  Sad to say, I actually trashed it.  I am so confident in Jillian and the fact that she continues to make great dvd's and delivers results, no question there, as long as you stick with it.  You can't expect miracles if you aren't committed.  I got the DVD on Saturday in the mail and popped that sucker in last night to test out level 1.  I was in fact PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!!  The dvd is good, you definitely get sweaty.  She incorporates yoga moves with cardio intervals.  Very fast paced, which I love!  I generally get really bored of workouts that are more than 30-40 minutes.  This workout flew by.  It started and before I knew it, it was over.  It was a great workout.  Not as much stretching as traditional yoga, but that doesn't bother me at all.  This is just the right yoga dvd for me!  I plan to finish this up as suggested..... 5 days a week, 2 weeks on each level.  I did not find the moves or transitions difficult to keep up with, but if you are a beginner to working out in general, I would suggest watching the workout a couple times before you jump right in.  It's hard to stay in proper form when you are craning your neck to see what she is doing on the TV.

So bottom line, go ahead and give it a try!

Note: my HRM indicated I burned 130 calories doing this video.  which is not bad (I'm 5'4.5"" and 120 lbs.)",1379376000,5,1807,4.138328530259366
5769429,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I tried this DVD yesterday and really like it. This is not because I am a fan of Jillian, but because it is an effective workout for me. After doing the workout 1 (30 minutes power yoga without weight), I was all sweaty as if I just ran 5 miles. Unlike Jillian's first yoga DVD, this new one combines challenging yoga poses with intense cardio movements. The combination creates an effective workout. If you are a yoga beginner, I'd recommend you to try Jillian's Yoga Meltdown first to practice some basic yoga poses and then proceed to this Yoga Inferno. The pace of this workout is fast, so if you are not familiar with those yoga poses, you might not catch up with the ""flow"" of the workout. And this means you won't get the best result of this workout. ""Form"" and ""flow"" are important for this workout. I'd recommend this DVD to those who have done yoga for a while and need an extra kick!",1379203200,12,894,4.391566265060241
5769430,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I just finished doing this workout for the first time today--I'm a huge Jillian fan, but since I just finished a round of Ripped in 30, I was worried that it wouldn't be intense enough. How silly of me! I was drenched in sweat when this was done; just as much as Level 4 of Ripped in 30, if not more. (And I only did Level 1.) I am a yoga fan but often feel like I need to alternate it with workouts that get my heart rate up more--I LOVE the way this workout combines yoga with cardio intervals. I thought it might feel strange to do things like mountain climbers and plank jacks in bare feet, but it was totally fine... and it makes this quieter than a typical Jillian workout, which I'm sure my sleeping husband will appreciate! I will say that you should be familiar with yoga before doing this workout. She moves quickly in and out of intermediate poses like pigeon without walking you through the details of the pose. It seems to build on the more beginner vibe of her first yoga DVD, Yoga Meltdown. This is definitely going to be one of my favorite workouts for the next few months--can't wait to work up to Level 2!",1379203200,16,1123,4.252336448598131
5769431,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail, I woke up at the crack of dawn to use it!! I only used level one so far and it was fantastic! The 30 minutes flew by! My only hardship was that I was dripping sweat so profusely, it made my yoga mat slippery! I have her previous yoga DVD and enjoyed that along with many of her other videos and books. This new addition doesn't disappoint! I love that its more modern and done outside. A nice change from the gym setting!  I work out 5-7 days a week so it was nice to change it up and feel worked out! Can't wait to try level two!",1379030400,7,576,3.8813559322033897
5769432,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I was a bit skeptical to purchase this DVD as I was afraid it would lack some of the calorie burn that is present in Jillian's traditional workouts. Having said that, this workout stands above and beyond her previously released ""Yoga Meltdown."" Both of the workouts in Yoga Inferno elevate heart rate and leave you feeling like you really got a great workout. I do not have a lot of experience with the practice of Yoga, however, Jillian has modified this DVD in her style (combining strength and cardio) and does not disappoint. Level 2 incorporates hand weights to intensify the burn. I was worried this would be a workout I would have to ""combine"" with a traditional workout to get optimal results, however, having done both level 1 and level 2, I find I am already sore (which is great!) I would recommend this workout to old and new Jillian fans.",1378252800,164,851,4.605263157894737

5769435,2,B00D2YCLF8,"This review is based on the first workout, which I just completed about an hour ago. I will update when I have done the second workout.

Like Jillian's other yoga-inspired video, Yoga Meltdown, this isn't a yoga video, it's yoga-flavored HIIT. It is an intermediate to advanced workout from an overall fitness perspective, and involves yoga poses that would be common to a class around Level 2. So, if you're a beginner to fitness, and you're not already pretty comfortable with yoga, come back to this one.

This video does have a few fun twists on typical power yoga. It fits into Jillian's usual Get A Serious Workout In 30 Minutes ethos; you'll be feeling it by the end and plenty sweaty.  It's filmed in a gorgeous white sand desert, which is a nice break from fitness videos shot in gyms or fitness studios. The music is pleasantly upbeat, but not annoying, also a nice change.

A big, big, big downside: There is almost NO guidance or instruction about ANYTHING in the video -- not the yoga poses, and not the HIIT moves. If you don't already know good form for both of these things (and if you're not OK with doing a lot of rewinding after watching the models demonstrate -- there are multiple times where Jillian says ""Do it!"" or ""Rep it out!"" and NEVER explains what ""it"" is), then don't even start with this video. This workout will destroy your back and your knees if you don't know what you're doing; even if you do know what you're doing, you need to be confident about knowing when you need to modify or skip a move. You should have planking/chaturanga, chair pose, three-legged dog, and pigeon pose down cold, because most of the workout consists of rapid movements into and out of these poses. There's also a variation on a warrior sequence, some triangle-like business, and a token nod to the standard vinyasa.

But the biggest downside to this video: It's boring! Half the video consists of turning a yoga or yoga-like pose into some variation on jumping jacks. There's also quite a lot of planking and side planking. It all just feels like an unnecessarily complicated take on a standard bodyweight/calisthenic workout. I personally think the older video, Yoga Meltdown, was more fun and interesting (although that one is also best if you already know some yoga and can recognize injury risks without having them pointed out to you).",1511654400,9,2353,4.701456310679611
5769436,4,B00D2YCLF8,"Easy to follow, straight forward and still gets a pretty good sweat going. I was sore the next day. You can definitely make it more challenging by adding little variations to it.",1510790400,,178,4.59375

5769446,5,B00D2YCLF8,"This video is quick! She moves from position to position with little explanation.

I'm a huge ""yogi,"" but when I'm looking to really break a sweat, which is every time I workout, yoga isn't always the best option to be challenged and really get my heart rate up.

She moves quickly through all the moves and doesn't hold each one for long. I don't get the point of doing yoga and interval training together. If I'm going to do a HIIT  workout, then I'll just find a video that focuses on that, and there are plenty out there.

She combines moves from ripped on 30 and yoga meltdown, so start with those videos. She is much more informative in those videos and they will lay the groundwork for this series, not to mention give you a killer workout.

This video is for people who are familiar with yoga poses- correct positioning of the body in those poses- and also posses basic knowledge of weight training technique. Again, you can learn what you need to know in ripped in 30 and yoga meltdown.
Warnings aside, these are two kickass workouts! Even though she builds on previous combinations from other workouts, these are fresh and super challenging.

I'm a single mom of three, so I have very little time, and I just can't make it to the gym. 30 minutes, and at home, this is the perfect workout.

I have never sweated so much working out, and I loved it! Before the warmup was even done, I was feeling the burn. The first time, I had to stop for a few seconds, because I was just unable to do some of the exercises. Every time thereafter, I've been able to do more, and stop less! STILL sweat like crazy. I'm sore, and burn about 200+ calories each time.

Sometimes the moves don't really flow together, but they ARE repetitive. If you listen, you can fall into the next move easily. The modifier makes this a realistic workout for anybody!

There wasn't a lot of motivational cheer or anything like that, but Jillian really keeps your focus on your form, and completing the moves, so you don't have time to think about quitting !",1433376000,,958,4.305555555555555

5769556,2,B00D2YCLF8,"I got this because I honestly couldn't remember why I didn't like Jillian Michaels. I thought maybe it was just that she was so intense and since I've been working out more, I thought maybe I could handle more intensity so I bought this hoping for a great workout. Sadly, I now remember WHY I don't like Jillian Michaels. She is intense and that part is great, don't get me wrong, the problem I have with her is that she goes entirely too fast in her workouts. I couldn't keep up with her or her girls at all. They ran through the exercises more rapidly than I could blink. It's crazy. So unless you have watched it a billion times before and have memorized exactly what she's going to do and what each move is, I can't see this being anything but frustrating. However, that's just my opinion so if by some chance there is someone out there that LOVES to do really fast workouts that give you no time at all to get into each stance (even at an advanced level) then by all means, this would be for you. But if you're like the rest of the normal world and need at least a couple seconds to switch poses, get readjusted and all that, then I would pass on this and go to Bob Harper's Yoga for the Warrior one. It's intensity to the max (only downside being that it's long) but he gives you plenty of time to get into each pose and work there as opposed to giving you literally about a second to switch from position to position.",1428364800,3,1424,4.21978021978022

It'll take a while to get the hang of the workout as its a little complicated in movements, and I didn't feel like there was enough core work (or maybe I was doing it wrong).

While I love the new scenery and new moves, I have to admit this one is hard to follow. The first time through, I was totally lost. It's not the typical DVD routine of showing you how to do the move and repping it out for a while. Some moves she'll briefly walk you through but they're over by the time you master it, and others she simply doesn't explain. You just need to know them from other DVDs or from past yoga practice. There's also some cardio involved that isn't in meltdown (which makes sense, being that it's inferno).

I was able to keep up and follow even though it has been years since I've done yoga regularly. It was fun, I felt challenged, and it is enough of a workout to consider it cardio.

I'm familiar with yoga and I'm familiar with Jillian's style, but I couldn't keep up with her and I found myself getting increasingly annoyed - which is the opposite of what I want when I'm working out. Her moves aren't traditional yoga poses, they are modifications that get your heart rate and major muscle groups involved. I like that concept, but her speed and the fact that she doesn't explain what she's doing make it kind of hard to stop staring at the TV when you're supposed to be in downward dog.

However knowing that, you can enjoy this workout and know your butt will be seriously kicked at the end of 30 minutes. Jillian will work you hard and fast. She will get your heart pumping and all of you moving. No hanging out and enjoying the view in down dog here. This is non-stop fast paced fat burning, strength building ""yoga"" (because I think there is a warrior in it) workout. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every minute of it. I love the way Jillian took yoga asanas and put them together with calesthinics. Her flows are orginal and unique.

An inferno it is. I'm pretty athletic, and this workout video had me sweating even in the opening stretch sequence. I burned roughly 400 calories (I have a polar ft 80) in each workout.
The ONLY reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is that if you are looking for any time of formal yoga routine, this may not be the right video for you. While it uses mostly yoga moves and a few yoga sequences, it's done in a cardio way to burn the calories more than focus on the true heart of yoga.

5769640,4,B00D2YCLF8,"I have experience in intermediate yoga and I'm a fan of Jillian's DVDs. I hadn't done yoga daily in a couple of years so I wanted to get back into it.

For anyone saying they were shocked that this yoga DVD was not relaxing, it's Jillian Michaels... At the end of Workout 1 she says ""I WANT you to be uncomfortable!"" She wants you to push yourself and she's more concerned about burning calories. She is a weight loss expert after all. So if you're looking for relaxing yoga, don't look here. However, if you want a good workout while becoming more flexible, this is the DVD for you.

WARNING: if you're like me and you haven't done yoga in a while and you're not very physically fit, you probably won't finish workout 1 on the first try. Keep at it and eventually you'll get used to it.

ALSO, she has a woman behind her that does a modified (easier) version, she does the intermediate, and the other woman does the advanced version. So if Jillian's moves are too hard, you can't really complain because there's easier ones there for you. Also, any DVD called YOGA INFERNO doesn't really give off the ""ohm namaste"" relaxation vibe.

Personally, I think the sequence of exercises are rushed and ineffective; I worry for people who like guidance for body positioning/awareness. Quality-wise, if you're looking for a yoga DVD, I would choose Yoga Meltdown over this.",1397779200,,457,5.026315789473684

5769650,1,B00D2YCLF8,Yoga is supposed to be relaxing and this program is anything but. The problem is that the transitions are too fast and the warm up isn't comprehensive enough. Also Jillian doesn't lead you through the routine with enough depth so you have to constantly look up at the models which is distracting. This isn't yoga; it's a cardio workout.,1397260800,5,336,4.711864406779661

5769653,1,B00D2YCLF8,"First, why would you tape a DVD in the desert where you have to wear sunglasses.  The background is beautiful but they look dumb working out in sunglasses.  The work out themselves are very challenging but for 2 workouts and the cost of the DVD doesn't present a great deal.  Jillian doesn't even work out through her own routine in the videos.  She just narrates.  That also is very annoying.  There must be other videos out there that have more benefit.",1395964800,4,455,4.555555555555555
5769654,5,B00D2YCLF8,"Ok , I'm really giving this a 4.5 star because I do love this DVD. However, the reason for taking down half a star is because Jillian moved too quickly, without giving thorough instructions. I found myself looking up at the screen too often to see what the girls were doing. But, as i continue to use this DVD, that will no longer be an issue.

I tried workout # 1 yesterday & I loved it because I felt like I got a complete workout in a short amount of time. In 30 minutes, I squeezed in yoga (which is also strength training) plus cardio. I tried workout # 2 this morning (12 hours ago) and boy am I sore!!! Both workouts were challenging, but the moves were timed perfectly for you to catch your breath.

I also have her Yoga Meltdown, which I absolutely love. I recommend mastering Yoga Meltdown first, before trying this one.

Update: 4/2/14
I now give this DVD a 5 star instead of 4 because I've done this DVD multiple times now and it's truly amazing!!!  By the 3rd time, it didn't matter anymore that she was moving fast, because you really do get the hang of it.  Workout 1 is an excellent circuit workout; it makes me sweat more than 30 Day Shred Level 2.  And workout 2 is simply an amazing strength workout.  I now officially love Jillian.  I even bought more of her DVDs at Walmart the other day.",1395532800,34,1309,4.271255060728745

Maybe it's the general tone, the striking desert setting, better pacing, effective poses haven't seen before, Jillian's own improved yoga comfort zone, inspiring ""helpers"" behind her (they are so fit and gorgeous!), less giggly trash talk (I don't mind a bit for motivation, but too much is too much, like the gravelly ""who's your daddy!"" of Meltdown). This one is HARD! but feels so great, like the best of yoga and the best of cardio/strength training all put together. Thanks, Jillian, you are AWESOME!!!",1394582400,7,604,5.173469387755102

Initially I was very much put off by hte stupid setting: why are they out in the desert, courting skin cancer and spending huge amounts of money on production?  Why are they wearing obnoxious celebrity style sunglasses?  Why oh why?  But despite those vomit-inducing elements, it's a really good workout.

It is high intensity interval training with yoga poses thrown in and I think that's good for an extreme stretch/and cardio workout. Minding this Newbies should not get this DVD and should start with one of her others, I would suggest the Biggest Loser Cardio and Strength DVDs as good starting choices. Or Thirty Day Shred is a good choice too.",1393027200,,473,4.448275862068965

5769669,5,B00D2YCLF8,This is an awesome workout (I expected no less).  Definitely do a few run throughs at a slower pace to learn the motions before trying to keep up with the video pace.  The cardio intervals are great and there is no time to get bored as you are quickly moving between different motions.  Cardio while stretching makes this one of my favorite recovery day routines.,1392681600,,363,4.553846153846154
5769670,4,B00D2YCLF8,"This DVD is not boring. Love the cardio intervals between yoga sets to keep your heart rate up, very brisk pace between movements, and I was sore all over afterwards.  I felt like I got a good cardio and strength workout together.  Yoga has always been way too boring for me to stick with.  This DVD is great because you get the toning benefit of yoga poses but the strength and cardio of more fast-paced workouts.  This is NOT a relaxing DVD!  Jillian talks the whole time and gives very little instruction.  It will take you a few times of watching the DVD before you can flow through the movements without stopping to look at what she's doing.  The second part of the DVD using weights is even better!  I use this DVD on days I don't feel like doing anything or if I'm sore from weight lifting.",1392422400,2,797,4.337837837837838

Even the warmup is hard and lasts forever! I like how on her other dvds it's split into circuits so you know when one circuit is done etc. This DVD goes super fast! I mean omg! I was dead 5 mins in. More or less overly frustrated with the pace of things and also I can't stretch all the way down to the floor. Even the beginner person was more flexible to me. I was hoping for better. Guess I'll stick to the older DVDs if the new ones are going to be like this. Beware, this DVD is TOUGH.",1392163200,14,633,3.9921259842519685

Jillian doesn't walk you through the moves or explain what the poses should look like; a huge potential for injury exists as a result.  It's nothing like Yoga Meltdown. Even the women performing the moves on the video look confused at times. Sure, this could be a great workout if you ran through it many times to get it down solid enough that you didn't have to watch the video, but it doesn't seem worth the time.

I like it though. Challenging and not too long.  If you like her, but are looking for something just a little different than her normal stuff, I would recommend it.

I  read all of the reveiws so I could make sure the ones I bought were the favorites for advanced people and I'm so looking forward to them. I get bored fast and I mix up my workouts with running, pilates, P90X, I do 3-6 miles on the stairs a few times a week, I just like a challenge and I like to feel like I really did something when I'm done.

It is one of the most complete workout series I have ever done.  I like how she keeps you motivated and makes you through dvd do what she tells you to do.  I may not be able to qualify for biggest loser but I always dreamed of having her as my personal trainer.  I now have her in my home via dvd.  I love it.

Don't go into this thinking it will be normal yoga - it's definitely yoga-inspired cardio and there's no time for much meditation. Definitely not for the lighthearted (my parents, who do not do regular workouts and are not super athletic definitely could not keep up). The only problem for me is that I live in an apartment building and there is quite a bit of jumping/cardio in this workout, which I'm worried will disrupt my downstairs neighbor, so if you're looking for a quiet apartment workout, this is probably not it. I don't use the video as much as I expected on account of that.",1390003200,8,694,4.515873015873016
5769691,5,B00D2YCLF8,"Oh my goodness. I tried this today and totally did not expect how difficult it would be for me. Granted it's been a week since I worked out, but wowza!! I am a huge fan of her Yoga Meltdown DVD and in fact it is one of my favorite at home workouts. I bought Inferno a while ago but have just now tried it. I've only done the first workout but plan on incorporating the second workout on alternate days.

The ladies are in the desert, which is extremely bright, so she says this is why they are wearing sunglasses at the beginning of the video. Haha, kind of funny. She incorporates real cardio into the moves and let me tell you, they are not easy. Yoga Meltdown is a baby JM yoga DVD compared to this one because it doesn't incorporate nearly as much cardio.

I was shaking after the video and realize how weak I am. I plan on continuing to do this video for the next few weeks to build up my strength. THANKS JILLIAN!!",1389744000,,920,4.162921348314606
5769692,5,B00D2YCLF8,"Jillian really brings it during this workout.  So far I've only done workout #2 which incorporates the hand weights.  I used 3 lb. hand weights and could barely turn the TV off when I was done because my arms and especially my shoulders were so sore.  I do Zumba and Step a couple of times a week each but hadn't done any strengthening since I stopped doing Yoga and Pilates at the beginning of the summer because I became so addicted to Zumba, so I did expect it to be pretty tough.  And also I did this workout within an hour after finishing a grueling 45 minute Step class, maybe not my smartest move.  I am not sure I've done that many Chaturanga's in a month's worth of Yoga classes as I did in that half an hour workout.  I especially liked the moves with the weights.  And they are Yoga poses, although some will argue that they aren't traditional Yoga poses. and I challenge anybody to say that doing fly lifts (or whatever they're called) while in Warrior III isn't challenging.  Warrior III just stationary is challenging!  I pretty much moaned and groaned through the first half, considered stopping when Jillian announced that we were halfway through.  But then she said to pick up the weights again and that's what I did and finished!  I was pretty proud of myself.  I had to modify some of the moves, but not many.  And I haven't had a wonderful soreness like this in months.  I really think this is what I need to do in conjunction with my cardio classes that I take at my gym.  I really wanted to get some strengthening back into my workout and those classes at my gym don't fit my schedule very well.  As for the sweat factor... I was just as drenched as I am after an hour of Step or Zumba, if that's telling you anything!  Oh, and I'm 53.  As for workout #1, I did watch this after I bought the DVD, but it does have more cardio and like I said, I was coming from Step class and wanted less cardio.  Little did I know that there would still be plenty of cardio in workout #2 also!

So there's my experience.  As for recommending this DVD, I would not recommend it to beginner's.  I agree with another reviewer that nobody should practice any type of Yoga at home without having vast prior experience in a studio with a CERTIFIED instructor.  Jillian does provide a modification for beginner's by not using the hand weights, doing push-ups on your knees versus in plank, etc.  With that said, I still don't recommend for beginner's.

I do give this 5 stars though, because I'm not a beginner and for my purpose, it is perfect.  I think I may have to buy her Meltdown DVD too, I've read several reviews stating that it is more along the lines of traditional Yoga, nothing wrong with that either!  Plus I hear it's still challenging.

My final words on this DVD... awesone, challenging, inspiring, sweat-inducing and not sure this makes sense, but when you're done you're so relieved it's over but immediately start thinking about when you're going to fit it in again because you really know that you've been put through a challenge!",1389744000,6,3049,4.445045045045045
5769693,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I have many of her DVD's and Yoga meltdown, too. If you like her, and her style, you'll like this.

its tough, and Ive done yoga for years. Its yoga ""western "" style, for exercise and fast paced.

I like her DVDS because she really gets a great full body program in 30 min. She explains everything in detail, form is perfect and alternative positions are always offered- unlike very many exercise Dvd's.

Shes tough, but of course you can always, go slower, modify, do less, go at your own pace, just do 10, 15, 20 minutes, depending how you feel ..

Shes a great instructor and teacher. You will get a great, tone body using  any of her programs regularly, and watching calories and food choices.",1389312000,,697,4.456692913385827

5769699,1,B00D2YCLF8,"I love Jillian Michaels workout videos I have most of them and I enjoy them. I got this since my cousin recommend it.  I am very disappointed with it. I have taken lots of private yoga classes and yoga classes in studios, maybe that is why this is not for me?",1388361600,5,259,4.078431372549019
5769700,5,B00D2YCLF8,"As stated about Yoga Meltdown, I am not a true to form yoga fan. I took a yoga class in college and hated every second of it. It is too slow paced for me. I agree that it is a great workout, but it's not for everyone. Long story short, I picked up running in May and during these cold winter months, my flexibility has gotten bad. I asked for this DVD for Christmas. I tried out workout one today and am very thrilled to use this on my strength training days away from running.

One thing I love about it is that Jillian still finds ways to implement cardio within the yoga poses. Rather than hold the pose for said amount of time, she makes you repeat the moves to help keep that heart rate up which helps burn those calories. Granted, it is not your normal yoga workout. If you are in to the tranquility of other yoga practices, this DVD might not be for you. Jillian is still loud, yelling at the camera for you to fight hard. There is nothing quiet about it. (Which is why I personally love it.)",1388275200,,999,4.149484536082475
5769701,5,B00D2YCLF8,"If you are looking for a serene yoga workout with lots of deep stretching and new age music in the background, then this is not the dvd for you.  But if you are looking to shake things up a little and you enjoy power yoga, then you are going to love it!!!  Just like Jillian's previous yoga workout, this one comes with two workouts, but unlike the first one, both of these are challenging!!!  She adds cardio bursts in this time and you will work up a sweat!  My legs are still hurting from workout 1 yesterday and having just finished workout 2 today, I'm worried my arms may be tired tomorrow, since she adds light weights to it.  The vinyasas flow quickly, so it may take you a couple times through to adjust, but its a really fabulous workout!!!  Thanks for another great one, Jillian!!!",1388188800,,792,4.390410958904109

5769703,4,B00D2YCLF8,The only reason I give it 4 stars is probably because I don't like yoga but I know the benefits so I make myself do it.  Jillian is great and I enjoy all her workouts.  This is just not one of my favorites.  She does give modifications but moves rather quickly.,1387843200,,261,4.078431372549019
5769704,5,B00D2YCLF8,This video puts a fresh new twist on yoga. The video is very engaging and provides an excellent workout. I really liked the workout that incorporated weights. I usually do not like traditional yoga but I love this video. Great job Jillian !,1387843200,,240,4.604651162790698
5769705,5,B00D2YCLF8,"This is better than Yoga Meltdown and the setting for this workout is awesome!  I have taken many traditional Yoga classes, so this is definitly Yoga inspired and not your ""true"" yoga workout, BUT that is what I like about it. I did not get bored and I like the fact that I can choose a workout with weights if I want. The only thing that I wish was a tad bit better was that she talks alot - it's her typical motivational conversation that you hear in her Body Revolution series but because it is Yoga inspired I had hoped her voice would be a little calmer sounding, especially having the beautiful desert as the setting.  But all in all, still my favorite Yoga workout and I would recommend it if someone was looking for a hybrid Yoga DVD.",1387756800,,742,4.292857142857143
5769706,3,B00D2YCLF8,"Well, I will hand it to Jillian Michaels in trying to incorporate new things into a workout to make it more dynamic and interesting.  This is her spin on yoga....love it or hate it....I'm not impressed as far as a yoga workout is concerned.  I do many yoga dvds, Shiva Rea, Sara Ivanhoe, Bryan Kest, Rodney Yee, Erich Schiffman, Alan Finger, etc.  I find that each one brings something new to the table and I enjoy all of them.  Bryan Kest is great for a good yoga for cardio, very well cued, heart-pumping but somehow rejuvenating and relaxing.  Jillian's form of yoga is really a few yoga poses such as down dog, up dog, bridge, tree, incorporated with cardio moves (the 2nd disk actually uses weights).  I didn't hate it, I just felt that there was a choppiness to it, it wasn't fluid, it wasn't a relaxed presentation, it was still a bit of yoga with a drill instructor, which kind of evades the purpose that I do yoga, which is to get toned, strong and centered.  Now, aside from being ""yoga"" as a stand alone workout maybe ""inspired"" by yoga, it works a little better.  Those who don't have experience with yoga or who enjoy Jillian's other dvd's may really love it.  As always, 30 minutes packs a lot and you are definitely sore the next day.  As a ""yoga"" dvd I wasn't as impressed.

So, to sum it up, two 30 minute programs, both good on cardio, both good with showing modifications and your usual intense instruction style.  If you are looking to start a yoga practice, this isn't it.  I would recommend this for intermediate exercisers who just want a little yoga in with their cardio.  The program definitely did not flow like some of the other instructors I mentioned.  If you are looking to start a program, I think Alan Finger's Yoga Zone is a great set as are the Sara Ivanhoe ones.  When you get stronger Bryan Kest and Shiva Rea are great choices.

So, for me, I will be returning this to the library and can't see myself purchasing it.  I doubt that I will borrow it again, but it was an interesting concept.",1387411200,,2026,4.42972972972973
5769707,4,B00D2YCLF8,"I only did Level 2 of the video so far.  But from that, I can tell you that this is more of a moderate sculpt dvd than Yoga.

I love it because it burns calories and does incorporate the benefits of Yoga with the smooth flow of isometric moves but your heart rate does go up (some cardio blasts) and you use weights (3 lbs dumbells).

Definitely not for people who are looking for the meditative mind, body, and soul workout.",1387324800,,425,4.222222222222222
5769708,4,B00D2YCLF8,"I love, love, love, all of Jillian's workouts and none have fallen below my expectations.  There is one small flaw in this video - it's hard to find your inner peace and control true yoga poses when this is more of a cardio with yoga workout. Jillian has her drill-instructor face on, which is GREAT for all of her other videos....and it does motivate in this one, but I cannot consider this ""yoga"" because of the cardio intervals, very few static poses, the pace of the sequences.  If you have other Jillian videos, think of Extreme Shed & Shred doing the yoga intervals only, some of Ripped in 30's cardio (a few out of each week's), there are new and tweeked sequences, but nothing like Yoga Meltdown.  I do burn more calories in this workout compared to Yoga Meltdown which is due to the cardio intervals for sure, but don't expect any type of soft-spoken Jillian like in Yoga Meltdown; expect Jillian!  I do love it, I sweat, I feel like I got a great workout, but I personally would not call this yoga because I don't stay in poses long enough to help stretch and increase flexability in my muscles which is why I do at least one yoga workout a week.",1387238400,,1156,4.413145539906103

Takes place in the desert- beautiful background, good music is a great workout. I am in shape and was feeling it after 15 minutes of Level 1 (luckily it got easier the second half).

In about 30 minutes, I have consistently burned almost 250 calories.  I wear a heart monitor.  It is fast paced, intense and gets you sweating.  I am still learning all the sequences to the moves.  They are not complicated, but because it is fast paced and I am not the most coordinated person, I find myself not quite with the program.  Regardless, I just keep going and I will get the sequencing.  It takes me about 6 workouts to finally nail it.  I will keep practicing.  I have done workout 1 three times since I purchased this DVD.  I have yet to do workout 2.  If you want to sweat, burn calories and be done in about 30 minutes, I would highly recommend this DVD.  I also love that I am getting my heart going and I am barefoot.

Not super hard, so it's nice to alternate with some of my more intense cardio workouts.  I enjoyed the beautiful locale- it's shot in a desert, possibly White Sands in NM.  Jillian must be mellowing with age because she doesn't dish out as much to the girls in this video.  I kinda miss the old Jillian.  I do like her motivational pep talks at the end of each video!

5769730,4,B00D2YCLF8,Ok...I am in very good shape thanks to Jillian and I own almost all her videos.  I like this cause its more than yoga because of the cardio intervals she incorporates.  I liked level 2 better because I felt it went by quickly and I felt very challenged. I even found myself talking to video telling Jillian that she is crazy lol and I haven't been challenged like that in a long time. I am not a yoga enthusiast but I am familiar and being in good shape and strong I was able to do the hard moves along with Natalie but if you are new to the exercise world I would maybe put this on hold and work up to this video. I was drenched in sweat and I was extremely sore the next day which made me very happy.

5769741,5,B00D2YCLF8,"A word of CAUTION: This is not the yoga you are probably used to if you are unfamiliar with Jillian's take on yoga. Yoga with Jillian is not yoga with anyone else. So be prepared to wonder what on earth she is doing, making you do mountain climbers in yoga. But it is completely, and totally worth it. Just don't expect a nice, relaxing yoga dvd when you order this one.

Also, when I realized Jillian and her dancers were on a desert landscape doing yoga in aviators, I thought this was going to be a waste of money. It's a little weird at first. But it is a fantastic workout, so all of that can be overlooked pretty quickly.

The only negative thing besides the set that I can say is that she goes through the movements a little fast- even though I am experienced in yoga, this takes some getting used to. Normally she takes time to tell you what each move is and how to get into it and mistakes to avoid, but she really doesn't do that too much in this video. It's okay, once you do the video a few times you get used to it anyway, and then the time she does spend explaining a move feels like a waste of time. So it's not really a huge con to me. Definitely not enough to rate this below 5 stars.

THE WORKOUTS:
Wow! Workout one is intense. The cardio she combines with this yoga is ACTUALLY cardio. Her previous dvd combined cardio with yoga- sort of. It was just going in and out of yoga poses, which does increase the heart rate to a degree. THIS workout uses actual cardio moves in between yoga sets- like mountain climbers and squat jacks. So my original plan was to do a real cardio workout after I did this one the first time. Well, I didn't end up needing to. By the end of this workout, I was dying. I was soaking wet with sweat and in dire need of hydration. So it was a job well done. I woke up sore the following morning, so my muscles definitely felt it as much as my heart and lungs did. All in all: this is a really good workout.

Workout two is also intense, and combines weights with yoga poses. Be prepared- it also has some cardio intervals, too. She recommends using 3 lb weights, which I did. I could probably handle a heavier weight if I so desired, since I am coming off of a summer of P90X and I feel pretty good about my strength abilities right now. HOWEVER, when you are intentional with your moves and use isometric resistance with your weight training, sometimes those 3 lbs are enough. In this case, I felt like they were enough most of the time. I am not trying to bulk up as much as I am trying to tone, so I am less concerned about the heavier weight. But by all means, if you need to use a heavier weight to make yourself feel like you're getting something out of this workout- go ahead. Just know that I think you might be nuts, and you need to be CAREFUL, because you could really hurt yourself with heavier weights. Like I said, it's all in how the weights are used. I am really feeling this workout as well. It is a complete workout. The cardio in this is slightly reduced from the previous workout, but it is still there and you're still going to feel it. This is also a really amazing workout.

A note:
These workouts aren't leveled. They are 2 separate and equally challenging workouts- one has more of a focus on cardio and the other a focus on strength, but you get both in each of these workouts. This yoga workout puts her Yoga Meltdown dvd to shame, and I really like that one. Initially, I hated that one because it was not what I was used to with yoga, but after a back injury left me unable to do much besides yoga for a time, I grew very fond of that dvd. This one is definitely my new favorite.",1381795200,190,3650,4.171631205673759
5769742,4,B00D2YCLF8,"Jillian herself admits that this is more of a yoga-*inspired* workout than a pure yoga DVD. That's exactly what I was looking for - an athletic, yoga-flavored workout - so I really enjoyed it. That being said, the workout wasn't very difficult in the bootcamp style that I'm used to, mainly because each one is so short, and the hardest moves - whether isometric or dynamic - didn't last long enough to push you to that bittersweet spot of fitness pain. I also wish the workout had more flexibility-incorporating moves; I didn't get that loose and limber feeling like I did after, say, Bob Harper's yoga. This is only a minor complaint though; I'm a bit more flexible than average, so I usually need the really convoluted yoga moves to challenge me on that front. On the other hand, strength moves are my weakness (pun intended), so the multitude of chaturangas that Jillian asks for did push me in this workout.",1381708800,7,912,4.670807453416149

Having more or less mastered Yoga Meltdown, I thought Inferno would be too easy but instead it challenged me fiercely.

LVL 1:
This circuit is like of a Yoga version of P90X. Lots of cardio incorporated with stretches and more advanced Yoga Meltdown techniques. It gets your heart rate up and keeps it there.

LVL 2:
This circuit is more like a LVL 3 version of Yoga Meltdown. She incorporates weights with the new poses and goes a bit slower than the first circuit. It's all about control and I like that very much.

Overall both circuits have helped further improve my balance, coordination, and muscle strength. I like the variety between the two circuits. I use LVL 1 for cardio and LVL 2 for my weights workouts. The only reason this review got a 4 stars is because she goes too fast in the first circuit and I have a hard time keeping up.

I loved her yoga meltdown which I am glad I am familiar with because it made inferno just a little more bearable to do.

Jillian cracks me up, and she's got the best trainer personality that reads across the tv that I've seen.

Love the circuits, love the cardio, love it all! Jillian rocks!",1381104000,6,493,4.3478260869565215
5769746,4,B00D2YCLF8,The moves didn't seem that challenging but boy was I sore afterwards. It's pretty short in duration so it's great for when I have a little bit of time. The moves transition a little too fast between moves so you should have proper form or understand proper form for many of the moves.,1381104000,,284,4.377358490566038
5769747,4,B00D2YCLF8,"This is Yoga at a different level, adding hand weights and cardio intervals makes it challenging. A good work out. I did both 30 min. segments back to back and I was worn out. I would recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to step it up a notch.",1380931200,3,243,4.083333333333333
5769748,3,B00D2YCLF8,"Like all the other reviewers, I'm a huge fan of Jillian's workouts and look forward to her kicking my butt. I absolutely loved Yoga Meltdown because it combined yoga moves with dynamic movement, making you sweat and giving you a good work out. So I was stoked when I received Yoga Inferno in the mail, and unfortunately was pretty disappointed with it. It wasn't that much of yoga since there are a bunch of cardio intervals involved and you're constantly moving in and other of poses. The explanation of the moves and the queuing on all of the moves are terrible. You have to keep looking up at the tv to see what the other girls are doing, which is hard from downward dog pose or plank. I felt like I was straining my neck. It was a decent workout, and I did work up a little bit of a sweat, but overall, this is going near the bottom of my list of Jillian dvds.",1380672000,3,864,4.242424242424242
5769749,5,B00D2YCLF8,If you're looking for a challenging workout that incorporates yoga this is the DVD for you!  Get ready to bend and stretch your way through a rigorous routine that mixes yoga and cardio extremely well. It's by far the toughest yoga based workout I own.  Jillian delivers yet again. This is not for the yoga purists.  It's clearly designed to melt fat and increase flexibility at the same time.  This will definitely sculpt your body into long lean lines and help improve your yoga practice. A win win!!!!,1380672000,30,504,4.693181818181818
5769750,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I am a dedicated Jillian Michaels fan.  She puts out awesome workout DVDs, and this one is no exception!!  It is different than her other yoga DVD--I like this one better because I felt like I got a better workout.  The only bad thing is that my wrists were killing me towards the end of it; but that would probably go away in time after they got stronger.  Definitely recommend this DVD as a great workout!",1380585600,,407,4.315789473684211
5769751,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I have done this once, and love it.  It feels like a cardio workout along with yoga - not boring at all.",1380412800,2,104,3.727272727272727
5769752,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I literally just finished workout 1 and 2 on this amazing DVD and loved them both. I have a full library of Jillian Michaels workouts and this will definitely be one of my favorites to do on a regular basis. If you are expecting traditional yoga this is not for you, in this DVD Jillian teaches a hybrid type yoga, incorporating cardio and strength training along with yoga-esque poses. I have been a runner for the last 8 years and not much challenges me cardio wise, but these workouts got my heart rate soaring!",1380326400,6,514,4.4787234042553195
5769753,5,B00D2YCLF8,"Oh Jillian, you've done it now. I have Jillian's first Yoga DVD and this new one is a butt kicker. In her true style she coaches the viewer into some unusual positions with movement! You might want to try one of her other DVD's first since this one is a little advanced. I love Jillian and have most of her DVD's. She is motivational, fun and pushy (in a good way). Thanks Jillian for a super fun Yoga workout!!!!",1380240000,3,413,4.2405063291139244
5769754,5,B00D2YCLF8,"This is an incredible workout, but not for beginners. Jillian Michaels never disappoints, she puts an intersting spin on yoga by incorporating cardio to maximize your calorie burn. I myself get very bored from standard yoga classes and find both of her yoga DVD's work well for me. This is fast becoming a new favorite for me.",1380240000,,326,4.7368421052631575
5769755,3,B00D2YCLF8,"I was so excited to have a new Jillian DVD to add to my collection. Having a variety keeps things interesting when you want to workout every day. I pre-ordered this and popped it in the morning after it arrived. Holy cow. I made it through 5 minutes and turned it off.
I am not new to fitness nor am I new to yoga, but I could not follow along or keep up.
Undoubtedly,if I did this a few times, it would become easier to follow, but I was worried that I might injure my back if I kept trying it.
Going into it, I didn't expect traditional yoga, but I believe she needs to slow down a bit to allow people to get into the poses. It would have been very helpful if she did some explaining about proper alignment as well as getting you ready to move into a different pose.

I will always be a fan of Jillian's and will likely buy her next DVD. But this one was just not for me.",1380067200,42,873,3.960227272727273

5769757,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I am 50 and looking for the cardio without impact to the joints. This is the best DVD ever. It incorporates strength training, flexibility, balance and cardio ,all in 30 minutes! bravo Jillian, excellent DVD you never disappoint. I am alternating between level1 and 2. I would be interested in calorie burn for each level. A true professional that really cares,
 Thanks again",1379980800,4,375,4.9523809523809526
5769758,5,B00D2YCLF8,"I completed level 1 and 2 this morning and boy did I underestimate how intense it would be.  If you know basic Yoga moves and did Jillian's Yoga Meltdown DVD then this DVD should be pretty easy to follow. I loved the cardio intervals in between each set. This workout is challenging and will definitely have you sweating up a storm during the 30 minute sessions. It's quick, intense and to the point! Something I adore in a workout DVD!",1379980800,,436,4.45
5769759,5,B00D2YCLF8,"Just completed Level 1 of Yoga Inferno yesterday.  It is a jam-packed 30 minutes of great yoga mixed with short cardio bursts. The yoga poses are repeated through pose flowing, which increases the burn. I was definitely sweating by the end!  My only issue is doing the cardio poses barefoot.  My metatarsals are sensitive--but I powered through.  Can't wait to do Level 2.",1379980800,,372,4.857142857142857
5769760,5,B00D2YCLF8,"She did it again!  Another great DVD, I love it!  2 workouts that are packed with moves, not for beginners.  This isn't true Yoga, but that's what I like about it. I need more of a hardcore challenge.  Great workout doing both back to back!",1379808000,,240,4.266666666666667

Full disclosure:  I am not a fitness professional.  I do take 3-4 Yoga classes per week and have been doing off and on for a few years now.  I also believe that if you are starting a Yoga practice, it needs to be in the studio with a certified instructor.  Certified, as in has taken at least a 200 hour course, if not more.  Do NOT start a Yoga home practice without attending classes first.  You need a teacher to help you ensure the correct alignment.  Once you have that muscle memory of what a pose feels like when it's done correctly, then you can start a home practice.

I'm a naturally happy person - very upbeat and positive.  Thus, it is always surprising to people that if I had to choose one of the trainers from The Biggest Loser as my personal trainer, it would be Jillian.  I like to be pushed and maybe even a bit scared of someone when it comes to working out.  And Jillian fits that bill.

However, Yoga is completely different.  Yoga is not meant to be pushy or scary or really loud, though it will allow you to push yourself - mentally, emotionally, and physically.  It's an incredible way to exercise your mind, body, and spirit.  And you will build muscle.

I wouldn't choose Jillian for a Yoga instructor.  Her personality just doesn't lend itself to that type of class.

Yes, you can play upbeat music for Yoga and still get in the zone.  And there are types of Yoga, such as Ashtanga, that move through the poses quickly, so you elevate your heart rate more as well as give your muscles a workout.  That being said, Yoga is about connecting to the breath, and then connecting the breath to the pose.  But the breath is the most important part of Yoga.

My biggest complaints about Jillian's version of Yoga:

1.  The breath, or lack thereof.  You need to get your breathing in place before you begin your practice.
2.  The modifications.  I understand that you can't demonstrate every modification.  But, in class you have a teacher reminding you that if you have back problems, you shouldn't raise your arms or legs above a certain level.  If you have neck problems, you really shouldn't do handstand or even plow. That wasn't present at all in this DVD.  If some folks try a 3-Legged Downward Dog, they will probably injure themselves and not walk for a week.
3.  The constant chatter.  Chatter to tell me where my legs, hands, feet, arms should be aligned in a pose?  Yes.  But beyond that, not so much.
4.  Weights.  Ummmm, yeah, we don't use weights in Yoga.  You are lifting and supporting your own body weight, which will build a great deal of muscle on its own. You don't need hand weights.

As far as I know, Jillian is not a certified Yoga Instructor.  She should not be putting out any DVDs about Yoga.

If you absolutely cannot attend a Yoga class and could only do Yoga at home, go to the Yoga Journal website where they have some downloads and DVDs you can purchase.  Those, at the very least, are led by certified instructors.  Don't just purchase a Yoga DVD because it's from Jillian - it's not really Yoga.
