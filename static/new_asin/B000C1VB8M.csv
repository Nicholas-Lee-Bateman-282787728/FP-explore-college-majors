Over 6 hours of film we explore life like never before in cinema, different personalities set off into the world and how they each deal with the trials and obstacles that life can throw up.

A fascinating watch.",1137888000,7,300,4.555555555555555
2451539,5,B000C1VB8M,"If you like getting engrossed in a great novel, you will love seeing ""The Best of Youth"".  It's in Italian, with English subtitles, which do not detract from understanding and enjoying the interwoven plot.  The story follows a family from 1966 to the present, covering a lot of ground with Italian political history and wonderful sweeping scenes of Tuscany (Florence), Rome, Turin and Sicily.  At the Cinema Arts Center, in Huntington, NY, all six hours were shown in one day, with an hour break for an Italian-style dinner...to a sold out audience, on a snowy January Sunday!  The film is a masterpiece! Even after six hours I wanted to continue with the story.  Don't miss it on dvd!",1137283200,7,685,4.771186440677966
2451540,5,B000C1VB8M,"This Italian film is a masterpiece, one of the greatest works I've ever seen in my life. I'm glad I invested myself in the film when it was played in two parts at a local theater this summer. Director Marco Tullio Giordana's epic is six hours long, but attending the film was an incredibly moving and special experience. It's the story of two very different brothers, Nicola and Matteo, and how their family coped with the last 40 years of social, personal and political upheaval in Italy. The lead actors, Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni, each give powerful and believeable performances as their characters mature over 40 years. The scope of this film's story is gigantic, filled with fascinating, well-defined characters, and it never steps wrong. It has marvelous actors, a great script and beautiful cinematography. Most of my favorite movies this year featured some big quest or journey, an attempt to discover something new or find a way to grow, and THE BEST OF YOUTH featured the grandest journeys, the most interesting people, the most beautiful sites, the deepest tragedies and the most fulfilling discoveries. The act of going to the theater to see it - making two trips in two weeks - became an endeavor, and the movie rewards those who invest their time in it. This is the best movie I saw in 2005.",1135728000,86,1312,4.758771929824562

2451542,5,B000C1VB8M,"It takes some time to get into the story of this film, and the filmmakers take their time telling the story.  With most films, that would be a criticism, but in this case it is a signal of what is distinctive and wonderful about this film -- easily one of the most worthwhile and compelling fictions ever created for the big screen.  After about an hour and a half I was completely hooked and there was no chance I wasn't going to stay and watch both parts of this six-hour film, which is by turns touching, comic, and devastating.  (It is not, by the way, that the first hour and a half are slow, but that they are designed to give you time to get to know the characters -- rest assured that the film is never boring -- unless the very idea of a subtitled film about people from another country bores you.)  Liberated from the need to tell their story in a two or three hour scope, the filmmakers opted to make it not so much about a single event or action that affects the lives of a few people but about the people themselves as their lives unfold in complex and unpredictable ways in connection with the events taking place in Italy and in their families over a period of three decades: a wonderful cast of characters played by remarkable actors who show them convincingly aging and changing over the course of about thirty years.  We have time to get to know them, and care about them as people, to the point where they become like family.  It is hard to credit before watching this film the claims by numerous critics that after six hours they didn't want it to be over -- but in my case at the end I absolutely agreed.  Though it is not strictly speaking necessary and the film already comes to a perfect conclusion -- and is probably impossible, given that the film ends in the year 2000 -- I found myself wishing there were a third part.  In that sense, it is closer to television or to the novel than to most films.  It is also close to television in its intimacy, told as it is mostly through closeups -- but it is wonderful to see that intimate attention to detail brought to life on the big screen.  Still, for its scope and grandeur and power, and for its ability to connect intimate details to issues of extremely wide scope both historical and contemporary, it is very much a cinematic epic.  There are a few moments that test the credibility of the audience -- but somehow it all works to give the kind of enjoyable and moving experience that we often seek but rarely find in the cinema.  Definitely a film to see in the theaters if you get lucky enough to have the chance (Miramax has done a very poor job distributing this: holding on to it for a couple of years and then not knowing what to do with it and getting it out to only a few theaters: now it is running the College film festival circuit, so keep an eye out for it there; I got the chance to see it only because I brought it to the film series I run in Saint Petersburg, FL), but it is definitely a must when it comes out on DVD in February.",1134172800,144,3020,4.2513089005235605

2451567,5,B000C1VB8M,"It is difficult for me to write a review right now explaining why this is one of the best films I've ever seen while giving it the justice it has earned. The Best of Youth which was directed with perfection by Marco Tullio Giordana and stars Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni, is a grand epic that is unforgettable. Knowing little about the story and its characters I was unprepared by how the powerful soul of this beautiful film would affect me! The narrative begins in Italy with Nicola (Cascio) and Matteo Carati (Boni) who are brothers growing into adulthood during the 1960s when the country is undergoing major political change. It is a heartfelt tale that elevates itself into something more than a traditional family drama with Nicola and Matteo serving as our guides through the development of their country and family as the two progress into the 2000s.

To start off I loved the script for the film that was written by Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli. Every scene, shot, and character flowed with a genuine humanity that I wish most films had.  The Best of Youth is also a bildungsroman that is in tradition with Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone with the Wind,"" that it chronicles the lives and experiences of the characters coming of age during an important political era. For example, in the beginning the brothers are separated for a time and are reunited once again in Florence during the 1966 Arno River Flood.  These characters become apart of you as their story becomes your story.  A viewer can look at the Carati family and immediately find a familiarity in their lives that we recognize in our own identities.

As I said above, Giordana's direction is flawless as he invites us to feel the pleasures, nuances, and conflicts of the era he is depicting.  With the extraordinary photography by Roberto Forza, Giordana captures the best parts of Italy without manipulating the look and feel of the country to the point that the film's images have a documentary style.  Whether the film is shooting coverage of Palermo, the Coliseum in Rome, or the beautiful island of Stromboli, Giordana captures the beauty of Italy in it's simplicity.  As a result I was almost convinced that the film was covering the lives of real people.

Focusing on the beautiful ensemble cast, every actor gives the best work of their career. In addition to the tender, powerful performances of Cascio and Boni, all of the women in The Best of Youth play some of the best female characters caught on screen. Jasmine Trinca is heartbreaking as the mentally vulnerable Giorgia who helps define the relationship of the two brothers. Sonia Bergamasco is enigmatic as Giulia who's twisted political views drive her away from becoming a mother to Nicola's child.  A wonderful surprise is Maya Sansa as Mirella who exhibits such a genuine warmth and luminescence as the woman the two brothers eventually find love in. There was never a moment during my viewing of the film when these characters failed to hold my attention, or suspend my belief.  I truly cared about them even after the last frame rolled.

I could talk about The Best of Youth for days which should be enough for you to go out and see the film for yourself. It is definitely one of the great masterpieces of Italian cinema that belongs with the work of other great directors such as Vittorio De Sica (Bicycle Thieves, Umberto D.). It is one of my favorite films, and should be watched by anyone who can spare the six hour running time. I guarantee you will love this film as the characters become apart of your life. An emotional, powerful epic that reminds the viewer why we go to the movies in the first place.",1441843200,,3659,4.735849056603773

However, once I got into it, I could not stop watching it.  The characters are all unique and you continue to want to know how each develops.  By the way, I do not think you could find better acting in any motion picture.  I was impressed by all the actors, and I was particularly impressed by the actress Adriana Asti, who played the mother of the Carati clan.  She becomes everyone's mother, a superb performance.

The locations in Rome, Turin, Norway, Florence and others are beautifully filmed.

2451595,5,B000C1VB8M,"""Epic"" is a word too oven used to describe bigger than life events filled with guts and glory.  I use ""epic"" to describe great characterizations of two very companionable brothers jointly seeking their fortunes. Fate interferes , and they end up going their separate ways. There is the backdrop of great historical events in Italy which influence their choices, but both stay true to their inner values, ""living and learning,"" and making  the choices that are  both good and bad that are so Universal, that they are very relatable. The casting was perfect for all of the roles; but the lead actors give flawless performances. All aspects of this film (2 disk set) from superb acting, writing, direction, cinematography, music, etc. collaborate to make this one seamless work of art: the perfect film.

2451598,3,B000C1VB8M,"This film presents luminous themes but unfortunately does not flush them out enough. The main problem? It is not long enough! That's right-six hours is not enough for film of this magnitude. I was hooked in from beginning to end only to feel unfilled. This film will go by quickly before you know it and that's a bad thing. Ultimately this film rushes through each defining era without allowing any of the character some room or space to grow within these boundaries. It felt to me as if we only see ten minutes in every few years of character's lives.  Consequently, and because this film expands over several decades; the characters, especially the the older brother, are not well developed. The full impact of the climax with the older brother is thus lost on the viewer, with his inner struggles fully unrealized on the screen. Essentially there isn't a single subplot, and there are several, that I felt were spent enough time on. The exception is the subplot involving the grandmother toward the ending. That was wholly unnecessary and detach from the film itself.

 I would love to see the first three decades that this film explores to take up ten hours alone. The 70s era, for me, is that defining mark period where society would change and become virtually unrecognizable from the years before (post WW2 period). The clashes of old values with the new, the increasingly capitalism transformation of societies and its impacts and so on. So the potential ideas are abound here but never explored, only hinted at.

So it's really 2 and a half star. Not because I dislike this film, but because I liked this film so much and am disappointed that it is more disjointed rather than fully flushed out. The scale of this film simply demands at least ten hours, maybe even twenty hours.

2451608,4,B000C1VB8M,"It's good to remember while watching this six-hour marathon that, in Italy, life is like opera. In this version, they fight, they cry, they suffer, they die, you cry ... you don't know why. There was remarkably little singing.

Basically, this is one of those long family sagas, sort of like The Forsyte Saga - with hugging. It touches on the history of the times - riots, Red Party terrorism, the mafia - and interweaves it all within the fates of two brothers, and, peripherally, the sisters, of the Carati family. Loosely, the story begins with the brothers and two of their friends planning a trip together. One of the brothers, the troubled and unpredictable Matteo, is an orderly at a mental hospital and, witnessing the mistreatment of a beautiful young girl, Giorgia, decides to free her. This is the pivotal event that changes all their lives. Giorgia is sent back to the hospital, Matteo joins the army (we never find out why), Nicola becomes a psychiatrist, the friends become a banker and a construction worker. Babies are born and coddled mercilessly. They all kiss on both cheeks and weep. (Again, not British.)

Although I was fairly bored during the first part of this series, things picked up for me when they got into the rights of mental patients. There was a very moving trial scene that got me to sit up and pay attention. I wish they had done more with that theme. I also - and this pains me to say it - got really involved with the characters and had to move a box of tissues into the living room to make it through the second half. (OK, so I'm Italian. You gotta problem with that?)

The scenery, of course, was stunning. Even more stunning were Elessio Boni (Matteo) and Luigi Lo Cascio (who actually did enroll in medical school with the intention of becoming a psychiatrist). I'd say this series is worth watching just for them. Viva la bella Italia!",1350345600,,1877,4.61377245508982

So many things are so right about this movie: the acting, dialogue, pacing, story, stunning visual beauty, the music, the scope and sweep of the narrative, beautiful and interesting women, characters who are fleshed out yet still unique and mysterious---I haven't been this engrossed by a movie, let alone one even half this length, in ages!  It has the quintessential ""Italian"" quality of delving into complex subjects/themes without being ponderous or pretentious (French) or preachy (American)...there is an exquisite lightness, affection, humor and joy underneath it all, which does not grow old.

Antonioni, Fellini, Bertolucci etc. and having grown up watching some
of the greatest actors ever to grace Italy's screen, I can safely say
that this is a piece of current clichd Italian drivel, with overtly
melodramatic acting and soap operatic story line. It is baffling how a
country with such rich cinematic history is now turning out actors of
such subpar quality which can only be compared to the worst acting on
American soaps. I understand that there is a new acting school in Rome
from which they all graduate, and it shows. Unwatchable.

Having said that I do have to point out that the  scope of the film does give a very good insight on socio political events spanning the decades bewteen the late 60's through early 90's in Italian history.",1266105600,5,820,4.6875

Their family ties are strong but in the end their personal demons  decide their fate.",1260835200,,399,5.03030303030303
2451624,4,B000C1VB8M,"I watched this film in my Political Science 226 Government and Politics of Western Europe class. While I felt the film was interesting and mirrored some of the problems that Italy faced in the 1980s during the Craxi years of government (1983-1987), it appeared to me that the film ended on a too positive note. (There is no discussion on the corruption of the Berlusconi administration.)

Also, while I think the artistic direction of the film was relatively believable, it seemed to push Andrea's character into adulthood too quickly for no apparent reason. Additionally, Giorgia's character simply disappears after being released from the mental hospital and back into society.

I am not trying to criticize the film. It was not horrible. In fact, Nicola and Matteo (two brothers) are both interesting - seeing how each attempts to deal with the corruption in Italy. Nicola works within the system (becomes a doctor and tries to reform the mental health industry, and Matteo tries to join a part of a larger group such as the military and then civilian law-enforcement, in the hope of making a difference.

Nicola's girlfriend and mother of his daughter, Sara, believes that change can only be achieved through violence, while Nicola's mother believes education is the future.

Therefore, in the interactions of these characters - following the journey of members of one Italian family - the viewer will receive a larger picture of Italy. However, it will not be a full picture or a completely accurate one. Poverty is really not shown in this film. In fact, after about 1988, the film begins to move at a very rapid pace, ignoring the development of the Northern League and the collapse of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties.

In short:
The film is certainly worth watching - it may even be worth purchasing if you are an afficiando. However, I do not think the film conveys the culture and political situation in Italy as well as Dickens' ""Bleak House"" (1986 or 2006 adaptation) conveyed the political and cultural situation of mid-19th century England.",1257984000,3,2067,4.9797101449275365
2451625,5,B000C1VB8M,"This film is beautifully directed, written and acted. It's a history, yet an intimate one, of over 40 years(1966-2001) in the lives of a group of friends. It takes place in Italy and the richness of the experiences of these brothers, their parents and friends creates a moving narrative set against the beauty of the Italian cities and the events of history during those violent decades. This film captures what Peter Brook describes as the ""distance of myth and the intimacy of reality"".
It's the best six hours I have spent in front of a TV set in many years.",1252195200,,561,4.62
2451626,4,B000C1VB8M,"Regardless of whether this movie is a masterpiece or not, I am sure you are simply wondering  if it is  a good idea  to invest six hours of your life in it, and perhaps do so more than once.

The answer is yes. More and more often I meet people, both Italians and Americans, of any age, who have seen it: not only they are immensely enthusiastic; they were in fact incapable to split it in different sessions. I recommend watching it on saturday night: you are going to bed somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 am.

As you know, the movie follows a family for forty years: you are guided through most of the relevant italian events: the flood of Florence, the angels of the mud, May '68, university occupations, the Basaglia law,  terrorism, the anti-mafia team, the political scandals, and so on. It will certainly appeal to italophiles. Then again, it seems most educated americans are.

At the end, you'll feel as if you knew each character as an old friend, and Italy as a place you have been living for a while.

Personally, what I have most enjoyed about it was the recurring feeling that, in life, everything, good and bad, ends up to somehow right and necessary in its own way; and also the idea that trying to do your part in being happy and improving your corner of the word might be more important than any great revolution.",1237939200,4,1330,4.466942148760331

However, you should wait for what is coming. The last hour is so moving that you'll need more than a handkerchief. The acting of the whole cast is superb, as well as the photography and the music, including popular songs from each decade. Simply marvellous!

2451631,5,B000C1VB8M,"""The Best of Youth"" is a six-hour mini-series that follows the fortunes of an Italian family from the 1960s almost to the present. It is an amazing experience for the viewer. It's like a cinematographic version of ""War and Peace"" with a lovely, slow, thoughtful and ultimately moving love story at its heart.
  The movie is based around the experiences of two brothers who go through a seminal experience together when they are young students and react in very different ways. One joins the army and then the police; the other becomes a child psychiatrist. We also meet their friends, an economist and a builder.
  As the lens widens, we are drawn into a loving family circle. Every character is so precisely etched we feel we know them -- the speculator father, teacher mother, two sisters...I have to add here that the acting is uniformly superb. The music that accompanies the action is also brilliant and of course the photography and depiction of Italy are stunning.
  I'm not Italian so some of the events they live through don't have the same resonance for me -- the threat of the Red Brigades who engaged in urban terrorism for example.
  Here is a group of people who live through tragedy and yet survive. I was tremendously struck by the general attitude of the movie -- compassionate, understanding and yet it takes a clear moral stance. These aren't heroes -- just ordinary people doing their best. Not all of them succeed -- there are some tragic failures here -- but most perservere, working through the bad times to celebrate the good.

It is a wonderful journey that you are immediately caught up in from the first frames.

Two brothers are the main characters and they take divergent paths through various periods of Italy's history beginning in the 60's and working forward.

It's the kind of film that makes you want to accost strangers in the street and persuade them to watch it, just so you can share the joy and wonder of it.

I came across this movie in the middle of the night on cable t.v., watched the entire 6 1/2 hours, wanted more when it was over, and ordered a copy from Amazon first thing in the morning. I have watched the whole thing 3 more times since, and every time I see it there is something new that I never noticed before.

I am in my fifties, and this is the best movie I have seen in my entire life, bar none.  (And my 22-year-old daughter loves it just as much as I do.)  Yes, it is long; yes, it is in Italian with subtitles, and trust me, you will not even notice. The story draws you in so that in a couple of hours you feel as if you've known the Carati family forever, and you love them.

This is a story about events of the past four decades, but most of all, it is a story about the timeless themes of family, finding one's place in the world, loss, and love.

Spanning a period of some 40 years and weaving the social and political history of Italy into the lives of the main characters, it does it with splendid acting, cinematography, and writing.  The music, evocative of the particular time periods of the movie, always enhances the scene in subtle but  understated ways. The movie has humor and tragedy but never becomes maudlin or melodramatic, as American films often do.

For anyone who appreciates fine Italian films, this is certainly one of them.",1187740800,4,648,5.0754716981132075

I have taken on an almost messianic role in sharing the beauty that is this film. I've rented it at the video store and lent it to family, colleagues and friends. I've watched it alone, and then was compelled to watch it again with my wife. I still struggle to understand why this film is so beautiful, moving and engaging. I can only say that it is all those things and more. I have no doubt that the haunting soundtrack, and the notes of Astor Piazzolla's 'Oblivion' in particular, contibute to the film's impact; in fact the use of music in this film (as is the case in most Italian cinematic productions) is very well done. I thought that the film affected me in a particular way because I was born in the very same period that the film begins, and so I have witnessed most of the film's historical background events, right down to a drive in an green Alfa Romeo Giulia ti (makes an appearance in the film), which was the first car I remember being my father driving. However, I have heard and witnessed people having no such direct experiences, not speaking Italian for that matter, being just as moved as I was by this film. It must be the exceptional and intelligent dialogue. Brilliant insights that apply to everyone, without being pedantic or critical. It is the photography (in spite of TV budget meakeup, but really, who cares when the rest is so good?, the scenery, and perhaps the personal humanity of the actors themesleves, Luigi lo Cascio 'in primis' who can be so funny at the most unexpected moments. In fact, I feel sorry for non-Italian speakers who miss the comic - but well timed and executed - intonations of various Italian accents by Lo Cascio's character, Nicola Carati. He also gets the most memorable lines. two of the best occur when a sarcastic Nicola criticizes Giulia's emerging political fanaticism and then in a quiet chat with his daughter, when he tells her that it is important to be generous when life is treating you well. I'm writing thsi review, and I should be working, so I have not dealt with the subject to the extent I wanted; however, I hope that I conveyed my enthusiasm for this film, a film that has affected me like no other. teh one regret is that after seeing this film, nothing else will move you as much and most films even good ones will leave you longing for the mix of emotions that only 'The Best of Youth' can offer.

2451656,5,B000C1VB8M,"While ""La Meglio Giovent"" is not a perfectly made drama, it doesn't matter. In the end, one feels privileged to have followed its characters through the course of their lives. And along the way, we get to see the cultural and political changes that Italy goes through as well. It is a profoundly moving experience.

The series doesn't follow a traditional storyline, but rather follows the ups and downs of two brothers (Matteo and Nicola). And there will be ambiguity, for in the end, Matteo remains an introverted mystery. Is his self-loathing born from his inability to make a difference in his tumultuous Italian world? Or is it an imbalance that his psychiatrist brother Nicola could help him out with? (Speaking of Nicola, he is brilliantly played by a likable Luigi Lo Cascio. Bravo.)

Kudos to director Marco Tullio Giordana for not taking the obvious path with the story. For example, the mentally ill and beautiful Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca) does not take part in the improbable romance one would get in an inferior film. Instead, she fights her own conflicts of instability and independence and reflects the problems and evolution of Italy's health care system.

2451666,4,B000C1VB8M,"""The best of youth"" is a wonderful Italian miniseries directed by Marco Tullio Giordana that we can now watch thanks to this dvd. Truth to be told, this is the kind of great opportunity you simply have to take advantage of.

Why? Because this miniseries entertains, but also allows you to witness some of the things that happened in Italy in the last 50 years, from the point of view of two Italian brothers, Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) Carati. They are both very different, but thanks to them, their friends and girlfriends we can at the very least have a notion of what happened in Italy during those years. Mafia, floods, terrorism (the Red Brigades), corruption, yes, but also the transformation of two young men from starry eyed teenagers to adults that struggle with reality and its challenges, and find different paths in their lives.

All in all, I can say that I loved this miniseries. ""The best of youth"" lasts approximately 6 hours, but that was not enough, due to the fact that you want to know more about the characters and what is going to happen with them in the future. Of course, this series is far from perfect, but when the results are so good, and manages to transmit so much, who cares?. Highly recommended!

2451667,5,B000C1VB8M,"This six-hour made-for-TV movie is a drama about a middle class Italian family that covers over 35 years of modern Italian history. Its central characters are two brothers of different temperaments, whose lives take very different paths. The overall message of the film, that life is beautiful, is played out against beautifully photographed travelogue footage that ranges from Turin to Palermo, with side trips to Norway, and a cast of often strikingly photogenic performers. More important, the film's dramatic conflicts, which hold our interest over the length of six hours, include a political dimension as one of the many characters becomes involved in a radical leftist cell, whose mission is to target and assassinate members of the professional and academic elite. The film has been praised for its refusal to simply sensationalize its subject but to humanize all those affected (would-be assassin, potential victim, and police inspector) and represent them with some psychological truth rather than stereotyping them.

During the course of the film, a new generation emerges to soften the harsher legacy of recent history and to demonstrate that if life is beautiful it is in its returning promise that the failures of the past need not discourage our hopes for the future. While all of the cast bring to life characters that are plausibly real, the performance of Alessio Boni as the darkly tormented brother Matteo is a standout. The music score ranges from pop music and jazz of the 1960s to haunting compositions by Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla. It's been a long while since we've seen really great cinema from Italy.

The acting is superb, and every cast member gives a memorable, powerful performance.

Although it originally premiered as a miniseries on Italian television, ""The Best of Youth"" arrived in America in the form of a not particularly viewer-friendly, six-hour-plus, all-at-one-sitting theatrical release.  As one who loves movies but who can still acknowledge his limitations when it comes to sitting still for ungodly lengths of time, I really must take my hat off to all those hardy souls who rose to the challenge and went to see this film at their local bijous.  I'm not sure which I admire more: their physical and mental stamina or their phenomenal bladder control.  (For a bit of perspective, the film runs almost twice as long as ""Doctor Zhivago"" and a good two hours longer than ""Cleopatra,"" the lengthiest American film of all time).  Luckily, for the cinematic wimps among us, ""The Best of Youth"" has arrived in a format - namely, a two-disc DVD set - that is far more reasonable and sensible given the episodic nature of the material and our own limited attention spans.

Reaching across no fewer than five turbulent decades - from the mid-1960's to the present day - the film focuses on two Italian brothers who are very different by nature but whose paths continually cross and overlap throughout the years.  The younger and less ""promising"" of the two, Nicola, starts off as something of a dewy-eyed idealist, determined to right the social wrongs he sees in the society around him.  To this end, he becomes a doctor dedicated to reforming the abusive mental health system in Italy at that time.  However, as he ages, he begins to see the dangers of unbridled radicalism and becomes gradually more pragmatic and accepting in his outlook on life.  His older brother, Matteo, despite his tremendous early promise in medical school, is a fiery-tempered loner who turns to police work as a profession, a move Nicola looks upon with bewilderment and disdain, seeing it as a betrayal of the free-spirited idealism Matteo espoused as a youth.  One of the better choices on the part of the writers, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, is keeping Matteo a largely enigmatic figure throughout the course of the story.  They never spell out exactly why Matteo is the way he is or what it is in his background that has led him to the choices he makes.  The reason why this is so effective is because we are as perplexed by his seemingly irrational behavior as are the loved ones who so often become the unwitting victims of it.  In addition to the two brothers, the authors and the director Marco Tullio Giordana fill their canvas with any number of rich and fascinating secondary characters, some of whom play major roles in the lives of Matteo and Nicola and some of whom play only minor ones.  Yet all are finely drawn and expertly enacted by a flawless cast.

Although it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance, thematic depth, and ingenious creativity of a true miniseries masterpiece like ""Six Feet Under"" (though, at times, it comes close), ""The Best of Youth"" still offers much to hold the viewer's attention throughout its exhaustive (though never exhausting) length.  The film moves quickly, and it rarely goes for the obvious in its storytelling.  Indeed, it offers many unexpected plot turns and narrative surprises that keep the film from falling into a formulaic trap and that keep us wondering where it is all ultimately heading to.  In fact, the filmmakers often seem to be leading us in a particular direction with a particular character, only to throw up a detour and have us go in an entirely different direction entirely.  One of the few weaknesses of the film is that, while it touches on such subjects as civil unrest, governmental and corporate corruption, and underground terrorism, the script doesn't provide enough of an historical context (i.e. specific names and movements) to make it very informative for those of us who might like to know a few more of the details of recent Italian history.  But where it really counts - as a human drama filled with complex and fully realized individuals who make a mark on our hearts - the film delivers the goods and then some.

Of course, one of the advantages that a work of this length has over the usual two or two-and-a-half-hour drama is that it can far more effectively convey the passing of time and the handing of the torch from one generation to another.  It also allows us to grow and change right along with the characters.  The final scenes of ""The Best of Youth"" are tremendously moving and exhilarating simply because we feel as if we have truly come to know these people as individuals and will miss them when they're gone.  The penultimate scene showing the need for the living to move on with their lives harkens back to that lovely and unforgettable final moment in ""Places in the Heart.""

Naturally, special note must be taken of Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni who, as Nicola and Matteo, beautifully convey the subtle changes their characters go through as the years pass by.

And, of course, all of this plays out against the backdrop of the rich Italian landscape, filled with ancient Roman ruins, Medieval art and architecture, and glorious vistas of the sparkling Mediterranean Sea.  As a travelogue alone, the film is worth seeing.

Yes, ""The Best of Youth"" is long and time-consuming, but, as a viewer-friendly DVD, the length should no longer be an obstacle to one's enjoyment of the film.  Check it out and immerse yourself in the very special pleasures it has to offer.  You won't soon forget it.",1156032000,9,5524,4.801478352692714
2451672,5,B000C1VB8M,"If you have the 6+ hours - even if you don't - free them up to travel through Best of Youth.  If this movie/miniseries had been around when I was the age of the Carnati offspring in the 60s, I might have lived my life very differently.  It doesn't try to explain why the world is as it is.

I could rapsodized about the seamless acting, directing, writing, and photography, but what would that mean? Nor will I comment on any imperfections of this production because it swept me off my feet and embraced me with all its characters. There was no time to nitpick. Edmond Rostand or Steve Martin wrote - why sip from a teacup when you can drink from the river?-- This movie is a river of life. Do you need to review how a river runs?

It is so spiritoso that you will pick up Italian.  It is so thoughtful that you will question whether you have to come back to the U.S. - I mean in front of your monitor.  It will point out that our elders heard castanets in their time and may have learned some wisdom about life and our partners we should learn too. We need to open our minds and listen. What it says about love and the lack of it is a lot by just telling a good long story.

It is wonderful to see a European movie that sees women more complex than the mama or the troubled, nude femme fatale that gets the menfolk all worked up. It is refreshing how men can be portrayed as being invested in making things better through a regular life than having to kamakazi into eachother or sexual partners. Good people in the troubled spots in the world can ask each other, -- Are you happy? Don't you feel generous?. It is an empowering movie that we need at a time when volatile decisions are made on both sides of explosions.  The rest of us have to try to clean up the mess and welcome babies and realize elders often tried to do the best they could given how much there is to do. Best of Youth made me happy.

I found this film to be wholly absorbing. At first, I needed a bit of time to get the characters sorted out, but, before I knew it, I was totally captivated, staying up all night to finish the first disk and feeling frustrated that I would have to wait until the next evening to play the second one.

""The Best of Youth"" relates the saga of an Italian family. It follows the protagonists----two brothers and their friends----over a period of forty years, from the late sixties to the year 2000. The story, which begins and ends with a journey,  takes the viewer on an odyssey that covers the length of Italy and Sicily and is played out against the background of some of the most turbulent events that shook that nation during the late twentieth century: revelations about the scandalous treatment of the mentally ill; the flood in Florence; the Red Brigade terrorists; Tangentopoli (Payola in High Places); and the horrendous judicial assassinations in Sicily by the Mafia.

The film, however, is no downer. One comes to care deeply for all the characters, laughing and crying with them. The story, furthermore, takes unpredictable turns, maintaining the suspense until the very end, which I did not want to come. The fact that Italy provides the splendid locations is a bonus.

If this be Italophilia, make the most of it!",1148169600,8,1348,4.76824034334764
2451676,5,B000C1VB8M,"I guess that's the easiest way I could sum this movie up: It's a movie about life. Sounds a bit plain, doesn't it?

The Best of Youth, though, is anything but plain and boring. It tells the story of a family in Italy from the 1960's all the way into the year 2000. As you can imagine, alot happens in 40 years: floods, riots, people die, are born, part ways, meet new friends and so forth.

But what really drew me into this 6 hour masterpiece were the characters. There are no heroes, there are no anti-heroes--just people, like you and me. The story of Matteo and Nicola could be any one of us.

Speaking of characters, I haven't been this attached to the characters since I last watched an episode of Friends. The actors  don't play their parts, they ARE their parts. If I saw the actor who played Matteo on the streets of Italy, I would be like, ""Hey, it's Matteo!"" The acting was THAT good. You'll go through a full spectrum of emotions with them throughout the course of this film.

As for the pace of the movie, it takes a while to get to know the characters, the setting, but after about an hour you'll feel comfortable with it all. The plot twists are scattered and generously spaced, making them happen at just the right moment without feeling forced. I have to admit that some of the plot twists may not be anything new or innovative (alot of the plot twists you could see on any given day on a Soap Opera), but the whole of the movie is so well done you won't be able to care less. There are so many powerful and moving scenes in this movie--I'd love to tell them to you, but then I'd ruin your experience, wouldn't I?

I can tell you one I liked, though:

There is a scene in this movie where one of the characters says, ""I don't believe in exclamation points."" Let me tell you, this is a GREAT movie, and I do believe in exclamation points!!!",1148083200,14,1856,4.27065527065527

It's on two DVDs, no extras, which is a shame because it seems like there might be some autobiographical stuff embedded in the film--the details are so fresh and unexpected.

I've given considerable thought to whether it deserves 3 or 4 stars.  It's not bad, but I was expecting much more.  For a series that is only 4 1/2 hours long, it took us a long time (two months) to find the time to watch it.  It's not particularly compelling, but has some interesting, genuine moments.  A lot of it reminds me of the weekly soap operas that you might see on RAI USA.

I got the impression that the people who produced ""Best of Youth"" were not particularly familiar with the genre, or well-versed in literature.  The plot is often either pointless (for example, Giorgia's entire storyline) or cliched and derivative (e.g. surprise surprise, Nonna discovers she has a heretofore unknown grand-child, and thus finds a new purpose in life - shades of ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"").  This may very well be the best Italian television series ever made, but that's not saying much.  Granted, it is better than ""Incantesimo"".

At its best, it is a confirmation to me that Italy is really the best place to live on earth.  The depiction of Italian apartment life, the sort of furniture people have, is very accurate.  If you've ever thought having a lot of money and restoring a farmhouse in Tuscany would be fun, this series will indulge that fantasy. Hardcore Italophiles will surely want to watch this series, but don't expect anything as profound or sublime as ""Heimat"".",1144627200,11,1738,4.756666666666667
2451680,4,B000C1VB8M,"I share with the other reviewers the sense of enchantment that the movie casts on the audience; it's a feeling that only a few movies give you in a lifetime. I loved this movie so much, that I wished it to be perfect; it is not, and these are the 2 aspects that disturbed me a bit:

a) the depiction of Matteo's (one of the 2 brothers) character. Let's see: he is the first one rebelling against authority, by refusing to tell an university professor what the professor wants to hear, and missing graduation. Then, discovering that patients in a clinic are being given electroshocks, he attempts to liberate one (a girl), involving in the action his brother Nicola. The attempt collapses when the girl is detained by the police; so, what does Matteo do? he joins the Army, then the Police. The movie never tries to hint (we don't expect ""explanations"", just a hint) at a reason for his choice (we only see his growing frustration and anger). Of course, Matteo's choice makes excellent drama (brothers on opposite sides, etc); but the movie deserved better than a marketing reason.
b) about Nicola, the brother who becomes a doctor fighting on behalf of mental patients. He becomes increasingly convinced that  mentally ill patients can (after treatment) be released to normal life. This links perfectly with the previous episode (he and his brother trying to free that girl), and it is historically accurate (the rebellion against the barbaric ""experiments""). Unfortunately, the real story is more complex than that: many Italian mental institutions used that theory to get rid of ill people, with disastrous effects. Why not to show that Nicola had illusions too (although certainly a lot more constructive than the ones of his wife and of his brother), and that life is always more complicated than our dreams?

Enough of criticism. Of all the great moments of the movie, I will mention these 3:
1) when Nicola comes back home early one day and finds his wife Giulia with a group of extremists (and catches the last part of a passionate ""revolutionary"" speech of one of them). Without one word, he takes his young daughter by hand to leave the house and, while passing in front of them (who stare in silence, frozen), he makes a parody of the speech, singing and dancing around his daughter. It is not that the parody is amusing, but its purpose that is beautiful: like Benigni in ""La Vita e' bella"", he wants to make his daughter believe that all what she has heard that afternoon is a kind of theatre. An extremely intelligent, and moving scene.
2) Giulia, in prison, receiving the books of music from her husband Nicola. She (who had loved playing music) begins to read the notes, and the music arises from the pages, cancelling for a moment everything else (I remember a similar scene in ""Amadeus"", when Mozart tunes out the noise of people shouting in his house, by just looking at the notes). Then, Giulia (probably thinking that this is a ploy to ""weaken"" her revolutionary resolve), suddenly closes the books (the music stops at once) and sends them back. Not one word is said. Great scene, intelligent, credible.
3) the moment when Matteo decides to quit. That hesitation about the shoes... extraordinary (in its apparent absurdity).

One immense plus of the movie: paying a tribute (via the sister of Nicola and Matteo, Adriana) to those courageous judges - Giovanni Falcone and others - and policemen who threatened for the first time in Italy the heart of the Mafia, and who were murdered in a major terrorist bomb attack (that blew 300 hundreds feet of a highway, killing the judge and all the police escort).
[A personal anecdote: I happened to be visiting Italy the day that Falcone was assassinated in May 1992; I still remember with incredulity that evening, when the main State-owned TV channel RAI-1 presented the usual idiotic show (scantily dressed girls, songs, games, etc): this, 4 hours after the massacre! ""Panem et circenses"" (""bread and shows""), said the Romans; it still works perfectly, 2000 years later]

One last observation: some viewers found a bit ""cheesy"" the ending moment with ""the ghost"". I confess that I found it deeply poetical; but perhaps, the classical education (Gods' messangers intervening in people's life...) drilled by school in us Italians played a hidden role in my brain.",1144195200,12,4326,4.848443843031123
2451681,5,B000C1VB8M,"This is the greatest film to come out of Italy in many years. Originally made as a miniseries for RAI TV, but you'd never know it. Works beautifully on big screen or small. Astonishingly good script, terrific acting by the four leads (Boni, Lo Cascio, Trinca, and Asti), and very nice (but not groundbreaking) directing.

'Best of Youth' is a profound political allegory in the guise of a very absorbing and deeply moving soap opera. Story follows the two Carati brothers, Nicola and Matteo, through the turbulent decades from 1966 to 2003, during which they and their friends and family experience many of the most explosive moments in Italy's recent history--the flooding of Florence, the student riots, the FIAT layoffs, the mafia wars and Red Brigade terrorism of the 80s, the restructuring of the economy, etc.--all without ever seeming too contrived. The characters of the two brothers are individualized, complex, and perfectly credible.

The first time you watch this movie, you get caught up in its very touching story full of people you come to care about very much, as if they were members of your own family. The second and third times you start to notice all sorts of parallels with modern Italian political history supported by lots and lots of subtle symbolism and carefully developed themes. From the song that plays over the opening credits to the last shot of the entire movie, everything fits together like a precision watch that keeps perfect time. The more I see this movie, the more impressed I am with it. Here it is months later and I'm still thinking about it.

Performances are superb throughout. Paticularly Luigi Lo Cascio (Nicola). Although maybe a few too many loose ends are are tied up at the end to earn it 5 stars, it's an epic tale well told, and well worth 6 hours of your time.",1143763200,3,645,4.758928571428571
2451683,5,B000C1VB8M,"""The Best of Youth"" was originally a six-hour mini series on Italian television.  Miramax released it in the summer of 2005 as a two-part feature film (3 hours each screening). It is now on DVD -- actually two DVD's for the price of one.

The story is about a family in Rome -- mostly two brothers.  It opens with the brothers as university students in 1964 and the film follows their lives for the next 40 years, ending in 2004 and reflecting Italian (and world) history during that period.

It is a classic.  I found the first 45 minutes sort of ""ordinary, but good made-for-TV""  movie fare.  But it took that time to grab me, and from then on it was like a page-turner book you couldn't put down.

English subtitles are excellent here.  Beautiful on-location cinematography in Rome, Turin, Florence, Palermo, Stromboli, Tuscany and Norway (yes, Norway).  Acting is memorable.  Script, naturally, superb.

The lineage clearly was the inspiration for this two-part television movie which, despite its noble efforts, falls short in several ways.

I had read so many glowing reviews of this series (for it is clearly a TV production) that I was all the more disappointed by the by-the-numbers- plot and the uneven acting performances. The production feels in some ways as though it came from a checklist of notable facts gleaned through the past 40 years of European history. There is woefully little in this that feels truly personal, truly the mark of an author. European TV series can be on rare occasions true cinematic creations.

2451687,5,B000C1VB8M,"La Meglio giovent (THE BEST OF YOUTH) is a spellbinding drama that sweeps the viewer through Italian history from 1966 through 2003 as distilled in the lives of one family. Writers Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli have created a screenplay that is both informative to those of us who did not live this period in Italian political disturbance and simultaneously passionate in the creation of a group of people surrounding two brothers who propel the story with heartrending power.

Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) are brothers in Rome in the Carati family - mother Adriana (Adriana Asti), father Angelo (Andrea Tidona) and sisters Francesca (Valentina Carnelutti) and Giovanna (Lidia Vitale). Nicola and Matteo are devoted to each other despite their polarity of differences in personalities and beliefs. With their childhood friends Carlo (Fabrizio Gifuni) and Vitale (Claudio Gio) they begin their an adventure of travel to the northern regions of the globe, but Nicola and Matteo encounter and rescue a young abused girl Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca) who is confined in an asylum, a pause for humanity reasons that alters their lives forever. Matteo joins the military and then the police force while Nicola travels to Norway to work as a hippie laborer. He returns to Italy after the flood of Florence, and meets Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco) a talented piano player who sympathizes with the Red Brigade of socialism. Matteo, as an angry rebel spirit travels to Sicily where he encounters and encourages photographer Mirella (Maya Sansa). Due in part to his devotion to Giorgia's plight, Nicola becomes a psychiatrist. These four main characters then are the keys to the story which lives through the myriad terrorist political upheavals in Italy during that forty year period but also demonstrate the profound effect that family and friendship have on shaping the destinies of all concerned.

Of course the story is far richer than this brief synopsis (the film is after all over six hours long!) and it is conducted like a symphony by the gifted director Marco Tullio Giordana. Originally screened as a television miniseries in Italy, the six hourly episodes are seamlessly joined for the award winning theatrical release and the result the film is a drama that stirs every emotion in the human spirit. It boasts brilliant cinematography by Roberto Forza and a musical score that is fine pastiche of works by Bach, Georges Delerue, Mozart, Astor Piazzolla, and Giovanni Sollima. The cast succeeds in brandishing talent so deeply embedded in their characters that each becomes part of the viewers' psyche. This is a stunning film, one that once seen will probably find its way into the permanent film libraries of those who appreciate great cinematic art. An exceptional visual and emotional experience. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 06",1142640000,9,2860,5.188311688311688

2451691,5,B000C1VB8M,"I saw a review for The Best of Youth over a year ago when it was in theaters (and I was nowhere near a theater where it was playing).  I copied the review onto a document and saved it on the desktop of my computer as a reminder to keep checking for its release.  I was so excited in November when the release was announced, and even though I got the movie on a Thursday night, I popped it in to see how much I could watch before I dropped.

The movie takes you in immediately, and covers a lot of ground it its 6 hours.  That isn't to say that it moves at a brisk pace.  The film explores the relationships between its characters fully, exposing the passion and pathos that make life rich.  Could someone have edited it down to less?  Probably, but we are talking about a film made by people for whom lunch is a 2-hour event and ""il dolce far niente"" is an acceptable pastime, so some of the downtime and details (like one girl's youthful foray into fencing) we just take and weave into this full portrait of the lives presented.

The opening credits feature photographs that I can't help thinking must be as familiar to an Italian audience as the picture of Dewey holding the ""DEWEY WINS"" newspaper is to an American viewer.  For me, the systematic depiction of historic and cultural events that have rocked Italy since the 1960s, as seen through the viewpoints of the two very different main characters (one as the ""everyman"" and liberal voice, the other as the government and law) made the film, which would have been good anyway, particularly valuable and insightful.  We get to glimpse Italy as it sees itself.

And the beautiful thing is that in spite of the turmoil of the past 35 years, this Italy sees healing, hope, and promise in its future.",1140912000,3,1752,4.426791277258567
2451692,4,B000C1VB8M,"Patronage has established full-length films to last an average of 100 minutes (emulating modern straight theatre) which is arbitrary when we consider, say, the calvary that genius film maker Eric Von Stroheim faced in the 20s with his producer's scissors, particularly across his masterpiece ""Greed"" which he intended to last about 6 hours. TV origins or not, it is interesting to compare this movie with any ordinary full-length one to appreciate that cinema as an art form is perfectly able to render the complexities and span of a novel; we viewers can well assume a greater canvas and capture miscellaneous, extended facets of story, characters and theme. There is no reason but commercial marketing (the eternal patron and master of this media) to restrain the works of film within an imposed length: a movie should last as much as it needs to. Short, concise films like, say, Jean Vigo's are perfectly fine within its structure, yet so many others (mostly when adapting literary sources) fail to convey depth and richness by having to comply to the rules. Different challenges arise of course when building a bigger construction and ""La Meglio Giuvent"" remains its best within the first four hours, before the story becomes over-sentimental, the shots pointlessly `picturesque' and the characters grow old through the customary, unlikely make-up device. Yet the expanded structure in this case manages to convey a stimulating historical document related by Marco Tullio Giordana's cast seeming almost improvising their lines, such is the freshness, veracity, lightness, the gorgeous spontaneous humour of their dialogue. Even without understanding the original language, anyone can appreciate its unaffected, distinctive musicality, rhythm and wit. Thanks to the main, corpulent body of this film, Italian cinema proves to endure and hold-out, in spite of a current government that endeavours to mar just about the whole of its legendary culture.",1140912000,2,1952,5.361563517915309

The characters -- whose lives you follow over four decades -- are so intricately drawn, their stories so deftly tied up with Italy's history, that it's hard to let them go.

The central relationship of the film is that between two brothers, Matteo and Nicola.  Nicola, the more grounded of the two, becomes a doctor and has a child as a young man.  Matteo, emotional and tortured by his own demons, joins the army and is the soul of the film.  But throughout we're introduced to so many others, and the ways in which their stories come and go and intermix with those of the two brothers is utterly masterful.

The individual threads of the story do lapse a little into melodrama in the end, but nonetheless the emotions feel deserved.  And the acting, with the exception of one or two overdone scenes, is exceptional throughout.  I can't recommend this highly enough.",1140825600,,1222,4.493212669683258

This movie is filmed in numerous locations throughout Italy; Turin, Rome, Milan, Palermo and the wonderful scenery of the Tuscan region. Note: This movie is a 2 DVD set.

2451695,4,B000C1VB8M,"""The Best of Youth"" is a very moving, engaging, complete tale of the journey two brothers make and how these journeys affect and are affected by their family members.

Part of the reason for the film's success is its length. The film is long. Very long. When it was released in theaters last summer, it played as two separate films, requiring admission for each. Originally made as a miniseries for Italian television, the film runs over 6 hours long. Watching this in a theater would require some fortitude, planning, investment, but watching it at home, on DVD, allows a more leisurely pace; you can watch a bit, take a break, watch a bit more, make some dinner, continue watching, maybe continue on the next night. Even though the film follows the lives of two brothers throughout, there are very distinct `chapters' to their lives, the one indication of the projects origins as a television miniseries. It retains some of its episodic quality, giving you good indications of when one subplot is winding down and when another will begin.

Because of the length, we spend a lot of time with these characters; we feel we get to know them. At the end of the journey, I defy you to not have used at least one tissue, probably more. The combination of good acting, engaging storytelling and the film's duration allows us to get up close and personal with these people. As we follow their lives over the course of four decades, we witness the good and the bad events, and the bad will probably bring you to tears.

We first meet Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) in the early 60s. Each is about to take their exams at the University and will then go on an extended trip with their friends for the summer. That's the plan anyway. Matteo is studying literature, Nicola medicine. To earn some extra cash for the trip, Matteo takes a job at the local asylum; the job is to take Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca), a young woman, out for walks, fresh air, etc. Matteo soon realizes she is one of many patients who are receiving electroshock therapy and decides to take Giorgia back to her parents, in a remote Italian village. He enlists Nicola's reluctant help; they will make a quick detour and then rejoin their friends at a later stage. But this detour doesn't go as planned and their lives begin to move in different directions. This only scratches the surface of the events throughout the film, their lives take many divergent paths throughout, but it should give you a feel of the tone of the film.

All of the actors are good. As we follow them over the course of decades, they don't seem to age much, with the exception of more gray hair. But that is beside the point; they mature, they act differently as humans, and they grow. Luigi Lo Cascio plays Nicola, the more level headed of the two brothers. Eventually, he becomes a psychiatrist, adding a level of understanding to his character. As he deals with problems, both in his life and others, he remains calm, collected and a little impassive, showing little emotion. When he does show emotion, we really feel these moments with him. His few and rare emotional outbursts signal to us that something serious is happening. Pay attention.

Alessio Boni plays Matteo, the more emotional, eccentric brother. Matteo studies literature, but after a disastrous exam, decides to join the Army. Then the police. His jobs, and his nature, cause him to become emotionally distant, letting out his aggressions at the wrong times, causing him to get into trouble. Boni is a very striking actor. He has the charisma of a young Harrison Ford or Russell Crowe. In fact, in the right hands, I could see him making the leap to American films. He isn't the most handsome guy to ever grace the big screen, but the combination of his looks, charisma and acting make him almost mesmerizing to watch.

Over the course of the film, many characters come and go and all of these are played very well. It would take too much space to list every character and actor, but they are all universally interesting and believable.

The one false note in the film comes when one character joins the Red Brigade and then becomes an assassin. This part of the story is entirely too sensationalistic. Like it was included to make the story a little more suspenseful, a little more interesting, to garner more viewers. Perhaps this type of thing happened, but the rest of the film is about a large extended family. It doesn't fit and it doesn't work.

""The Best of Youth"" takes an investment; in time and emotion, but the payoff is equal. You will be rewarded with an in-depth look into the lives and struggles of a large, extended family in Italy. Even better yet? No one in the family is involved in the Mafia.",1140480000,3,4733,4.646356033452808
2451696,4,B000C1VB8M,"This six hour film does not fly by.  It is vivid and warm.  But the first half (i.e., the first three hours) is suffused with unpleasantness due to the dour, humorless presense of one of the two main characters.  His presense is enervating, and it was a tough call as to whether my wife and i were going to hang in for the second three hours.

We are glad we did, vitality began to suffuse the screen, life, friends and family against a moving tableaux of southern and northern Italy.  There was few of those celebrations of life that one associates with la vita Italia; the film is mostly understated.  But, over time, the movie begins to resonate.  Sorrow and Joy are everpresent.  Bourgeouis life is presented with heart and value as Italy teeters at the intersection of decadent grandeur and modern capitalist travails.

Is this a great movie?  By no means. But if you have a taste for character-driven family tales and find Italy and Italians intriguing; save for one maddening character, you will enjoy passing through this animated scrapbook of endearing people.",1140393600,4,1069,4.760869565217392
2451697,5,B000C1VB8M,"The concept of an intimate, six-hour epic is an improbable one, but director Marco Tullio Giordana has pulled off quite a feat with this marathon, 366-minute film, which is divided into two three-hour parts over two discs. Originally a miniseries on Italian TV (which explains the structural similarities with old American miniseries like ""Rich Man, Poor Man""), it's a masterful work with emotional pull, rich characterizations and plot nuances spanning close to forty years from 1966 to the present day. Ostensibly, the story revolves around the Carati brothers - self-righteous Matteo and optimistic Nicola, inseparable at the outset of the story as they attempt to leave Rome on a backpacking holiday in Norway. More importantly, what the movie does is humanize Italy's recent history on a more personal level. Giordana's most glorious accomplishment is how he keeps the story so emotionally involving over its lengthy duration.

The expansive, shrewdly observed script by Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli covers major historical incidents such as the 1966 flooding of Florence, the ongoing terrorism instigated by the Red Brigades, revolutionary mental asylum reforms, and various World Cup championships. There is no bulky exposition to these events, but frankly, an in-depth knowledge of 20th century Italian history is not a prerequisite to enjoy the human drama coursing through the story. Each brother experiences his share of trials, and the beauty is that they remain life-sized, not epic in scale, which brings further resonance to the broader events affecting their lives. What triggers the drama of the plot is Giorgia, a near-catatonic victim of botched electroshock treatments, whom Matteo tries to reunite with her father. Unfortunately, this act of goodwill backfires, and the brothers decide to take different routes. In vivid brushstrokes, Matteo joins the army and later works for the police, first in Sicily and then back in Rome. Nicola, on the other hand, ends up going to Norway alone; comes back to Florence to help with the flood victims; marries Giulia, a conflicted protestor; raises a precocious daughter; and builds a career as a well-respected psychotherapist helping the mentally ill disenfranchised. The brothers' lives intertwine throughout to the point where one seems to be fulfilling the failed destiny of the other.

The cast is superb starting with the two stellar leads. Alessio Boni brings a charismatic blend of passionate intensity and veiled vulnerability as Matteo, illuminating an increasingly tortured soul as he further isolates himself from those closest to him. Bearing a striking resemblance to actor Rob Morrow, Luigi Lo Cascio plays the more open-hearted Nicola with dexterity, unafraid to reveal his character's inability to empathize with the deep anguish of those around him. Many of the supporting players are equally wonderful, with particular standouts being Andrea Tidona as the brothers' crafty father; Maya Sansa as the sympathetic photographer/librarian Mirella; Fabrizio Gifuni as dedicated lifelong friend Carlo; Lidia Vitale as the brothers' tough-minded sister Giovanna, who becomes an influential judge; and best of all, Adriana Asti as the brothers' put-upon mother. She has a particularly amazing scene of visceral power outside of Matteo's apartment. In pivotal roles, Jasmine Trinca does what she can as Giorgia, though I tend to think her character is designed more as a plot device to bring the brothers together; and with her excessive facial expressions, Sonia Bergamasco somewhat overplays the mercurial role of Giulia given her character's lightning-flash changes from lover to mother to revolutionary and back again.

One area that is a bit lacking is Roberto Forza's cinematography, which I find a bit washed out perhaps because the film was made for television. Perhaps futilely, I was hoping for more of a David Lean-like quality to the imagery. Interestingly, the soundtrack is filled with period-correct American pop at the beginning when the boys are young but moves to strictly Italian music as they become older. Thankfully there is little attempt to use make-up to age the actors over the decades other than some gray streaks in Nicola's hair. The almost final scene with Nicola and Mirella walking in the woods is among the most touching I have seen in a movie. This represents vital, full-blooded cinema worthy of comparison to Bertolucci and Ozu in terms of the human scale it showcases. The two-disc set has no extras given the epic length of the film.",1140220800,7,4547,5.338912133891213
2451698,5,B000C1VB8M,"An absolute masterpiece. Seamless casting, directing, editing, soundtracking, settings and performance. So profound yet so down-to-earth up close and personal. This movie should get an Oscar not just an award from Cannes. The story and all the characters simply grow on you. A story you just don't want it to end but, gratefully it ended wonderfully perfect. Every character and role in this movie is so likable. Watch it and enjoy it. DON'T MISS IT!",1140048000,2,450,5.013333333333334
2451699,5,B000C1VB8M,We see at least one film a week and most are well rated and many times foreign.  Even though this film is six hours you will wish it would continue.  I saw it a local theatre in three hour incruments.  It was one of the best  film expierences of my wifes and my life.  A must see.,1139875200,2,280,3.8421052631578947
2451700,4,B000C1VB8M,"This multi-generational saga recounts thirty years in the lives of a Roman family, with detours to Toscano, Sicily and Torino. Thankfully free of look-at-me sexuality, the story covers two brothers, Nicola and Matteo, and how their lives thread the left and right of modern-day Italia.  The wishbone political schism between the brothers, presented with balance, never threatens to sever their mutual love.

The DVD features fantastic acting, especially by Andrea Tidoni as the family patriarch, and a very long story arc. Don't approach this if you're looking for quick-hit theatrics or artifice. Do approach if you crave fine acting (the subtitles recede after about 5 minutes) and a story of awe and resolution. Very fine.",1139788800,,725,5.2956521739130435
2451701,3,B000C1VB8M,"This movie was OK, but I wouldn't exactly say it was one of the best films of the year.  In that regard, it's clearly overrated.  At times it seemed more like a soap opera than anything else.  I personally was not that moved by it.  Probably because it contained static characters which is unheard of for a 6-hour movie.  You would expect some character development.  For example, Matteo is as hot-tempered, tortured and impulsive at the beginning as he is at the end.  Carlo is a yuppie throughout the movie.  Even Nicola doesn't change all that much.  From beginning to end, he's constantly protecting someone--be it Matteo, Guilia, Sara, Giorgia, and his nephew.  As I said before, it was OK but nothing special.",1139788800,8,715,4.739837398373984
2451702,5,B000C1VB8M,"Forgive me because I have NOT seen this 6 hour movie yet, but it was playing at an art theater in outer San Francisco during 2005.  And SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE film critic Mick La Salle proclaimed it a masterpiece and one of the best movies in ages for intellectual adults.  He said the six hours went by like a huge feast or a compulsively readable 1000 page novel.  Too bad the theater had no parking and was not in a safe area at night.

Watching THE BEST OF YOUTH on video, stretched out on a bed in bare feet with a bottle of water nearby, the movie's length will probably not be a problem at all.  Especially if you play it in two 3 hour sittings over two consecutive nights.  Give yourself over to it.  Sight-unseen, I hope serious adult moviegoers will find a six hour time slot for this presumed masterpiece.  Go with Mr. La Salle's review, not mine.  I'd like to buy and lose myself in the DVD.",1139788800,,904,4.270588235294118
2451703,5,B000C1VB8M,"There is something about the eyes of the two brothers that stay with you long after you have watched this movie.  So sad, so beautiful, and with so much to say--much like Italy.  It occasionally seems like the movie tries to cover too much history and the result may be a cliche or two. After all, how many Italians were actually in the Red Brigades? But, just when we look at the story on a personal (rather than a historical or political) level, it gets five stars.  I also want to add that the young woman who played Giorgia was absolutely fantastic.",1139443200,4,553,4.401960784313726
