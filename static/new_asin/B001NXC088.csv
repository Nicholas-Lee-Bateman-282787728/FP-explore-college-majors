8602396,5,B001NXC088,"This is a great film.  The CCTV/hidden camera perspective gave me the sense of actually being there, and really helped convey the mystery and tension.  The way Bush and Blair et al ran away with the Iraq War is a democratic tragedy that will (hopefully) not soon be forgotten, if ever.  ""WMD"" is the first film I've seen that reflects back on how it all went down, and shines a light on the inner workings of the powers that be.",1229385600,2,428,4.325
