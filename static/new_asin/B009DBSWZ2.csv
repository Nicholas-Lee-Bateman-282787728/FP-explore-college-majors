5319522,3,B009DBSWZ2,"I am a bleach fan but have to admit that this disc set was not as good as I had hoped. I mean where are the visards from last season?

The fighting in some of the scenes were boring and too drawn out! But it was nice to see some of the other soul reapers abilities.

What I didn't like was how they made the feminine women in the series look like wimps that couldn't handle their own. Ugh. Of course this is anime from a man focused and man driven culture, no matter, it's time to make a change! Come on guys!

Next I didn't like the fact the last disc has 3 to 4 fillers that are completely random. One ties into the beginning origins of Bleach but the others were just senseless.

Since I am a HUGE Bleach fan I love it! But these guys who produce this and put out these discs are RIPPING US OFF! Period. If I could bet that when I rented these discs that they would be in english dubb I wouldn't purchase them any longer, it's just not really worth the money. But because I can't, I will have to suffer.

All in all this disc set was tedious.",1356566400,,1045,4.0048076923076925
5319523,5,B009DBSWZ2,"I absolutely LIVE, EAT, BREATHE Bleach so, I had to have this! I have bought all the box sets as they have been released, and although I'm not a huge fan of all the filler arcs, I still love watching all the episodes! So, if you're just dying to own all the Bleachy goodness for yourselves, look no further. This is the most recent release of the box sets, and it's the uncut version. If you're a huge nerd like me, buy this and all the other box sets, and drool over all the awesomeness that Bleach has to offer!",1356566400,,513,4.14
5319524,5,B009DBSWZ2,"This item is good for collectors of any Anime Products.
I recommend Bleach DVD to the fans of the series.",1355788800,,105,4.3
5319525,5,B009DBSWZ2,"The battle against Aizen's forces continues. Yumichica, Izuru, Captain Sui Feng, Rangiku, Shuhei, Omaeda, Toshiro, Ikkakku, and Captain Komamura all get to fight in this volume. The battles are intense, and new powers are discovered. We also learn that Ikkakku's Ban Kai is not as big a secret as we thought. Even though the Captains are starting to get involved, the enemy is mostly just sending in their fracciones. The Aspada and the 3 Soul Reaper Traitors are mostly standing by. Until Toshiro engages Harribel in battle, and Kyoraku engages Coyote Starrk. Harribel reveals herself as the #3 Aspada, and Starrk as the #1 Asada. Rangiku also takes on Harribel's 3 fracciones alone until Momo shows up to help. Momo and Rangiku are defeated but Yamamoto stands in on their behalf. There is a ton of action in this volume. Once the 1st several episodes are through with, the series gets way more intense.

Unfortunately, as soon as the action reaches it's peak, we get to ""enjoy"" another story arc. I quit watching Bleach on adult swim, so I don't know how good this arc is. It couldn't be any worse than the Bount arc...or could it. Despite that, it's a very good series and this volume is no exception. It's a must have for any Bleach fan.",1355270400,2,1242,4.697247706422019
5319526,4,B009DBSWZ2,"Plenty of fighting in these episodes and the filler are mostly great in their own ways.  The best part about this is that its all canon episodes and if they keep the same number of episodes per set it would appear that the non-canon arch will be contained on its own sets.

I would greatly prefer if the price got closer to 20 bucks a set, but keeping non-canon episodes into their own sets would be my second want.

This set is nothing but great Bleach, the two or maybe three sets that follow it though will be pretty painful.",1350950400,4,528,4.26
5319527,5,B009DBSWZ2,"This set is simply fantastic. As in my other Bleach reviews I'll say that the price and visual complaints about these sets has been argued to death and I have nothing new to add. Therefore this review will simply be based on the content of these episodes, which is just great.

The episodes turn away from Ichigo's mission in Hueco Mundo and focus on the fights between the Soul Reapers and Arrancar. I really liked that they gave some time to Soul Reapers who really hadn't had much time in the spotlight like Kira, Hisagi, Sui Feng, and Yamamoto, all of whom we really haven't seen do much until this point. There is very little idle time in these episodes as they are largely devoted to the battles which I thought were very nicely done.

The last couple episodes are fluff but not terrible, certainly better than the Bount Arc.  In one it shows what was going on right before the first episode of the series. In another the Soul Reapers go to the beach. And in the last Ikkaku and Ichigo's friend's sister do their whole little thing. Not the best but all right.

All in all the episodes are great and you get to see the Soul Reapers and Arrancars just going all out on each other. For anyone who hasn't seen past this season these will be the last episodes of the main arc for a while. Hunker down because the Zanpakuto arc is coming up (which, to be fair, is better than the bount seasons).",1349827200,6,1396,4.378378378378378

then we take three side steps to show three side stories. the first is what happened the day before Rokia can to Karakura town. the second is a beach trip for the female soul reapers association, where they end up inviting some of the guy for some R.N.R. the third Ecoku is sent the world of the living to recapture a hollow.",1456012800,,757,4.414285714285715

Ok boy can see ghosts, some ghosts eat other ghosts so there r other ghosts that stop the bad ghosts from eating the good ones, boy meets girl good ghost that gives him the power to become like her so that he can fight the bad ghosts.
I know that the bad ghosts r call something and r a little different than just ghosts and that the ones I'm calling good ghosts r called something else also.
I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^
I really do love this anime just don't want to go into great detail on what is what when someone just wants to know the basics of what they maybe buying even though if ur looking for a anime u most likely already know what ur looking for or buying if ur here.

5319570,4,B009DBSWZ2,I really like this show bleach however it has taking many years for the English versions to come out and each season gets shorter.  not very happy about that.  the price is pretty expensive . as for the show it is pretty great . I just don't understand why they have not released the complete English version  I know that they are playing them on Cartoon Network . So I know for fact they have already been made .,1361232000,,413,4.2025316455696204
5319571,5,B009DBSWZ2,This DVD actually shows more of the conflict between Aizen and the Thirteen Court Guards only downside is there is two filler episodes and the whole next DVD seems to be the zanpakuto rebellion.,1359244800,,194,4.735294117647059

5319573,1,B009DBSWZ2,"At 11 episode increments, this show has devolved into junk.  This set was especially annoying because they hinted twice at ichigo's battle, only to switch gears to filler. The sheer amount of repeat that happens on each episode forced me to start skipping forward.  We are not talking about recap sequences, we are talking about straight up re-used material to space the show out.  Seasons 1-5 had story arcs and could be seen as a single product ranging around 20 episodes.  However ""6"" onward has moved to these ""set"" grouping, none of which can stand on their own, with story arcs starting and stopping mid set.

If they had continued along the 20 episode season path, we should be at the end of season 10, but if you look at the overall story arch that has occurred, we really have only gotten about two seasons worth of progression, and then a season or two worth appendix style history episodes and filler.  Take 3 seasons worth a material, spread it across 5 seasons worth of play time, and split it into 10 box sets, and you end up with the s*** that has become Bleach.  Very sad, since I do love Bleach.",1358121600,6,1112,4.502487562189055
5319574,5,B009DBSWZ2,"This box set has it all ....the continuation of the fights between  Aizen's Espada's and Fraccion's vs the Captain's and Lieutenant's.  The best part for me was when we got to see a brief sampling of the Head Captain's power ...THE BEST!!!!

On the last disc you get the ""GREATEST FAN SERVICE EVER"" from Ukitake and Byakuya!! ....plus the other  soul reapers.  It's mostly fillers that lead us to the  Zanpankuto Arc which is a filler itself but, I really love that arc.

All in all, if you're a true Bleach fan ....you will love it a lot.",1357776000,,539,4.438775510204081
5319575,5,B009DBSWZ2,"Amazon already provides a synopsis of the episodes which is essentially the final canon part to the battle in Fake Kakarakura town before Lord Aizen-sama is released from the prison. Along those lines it also teases the Ichigo v Ulquiorra fight in Las Noches. Unfortunately for manga loyalists the set diverges to a few filler episodes which are all hilarious and give a bit of development to Ichigo's friends such as their first day of high school and how they met Ichigo to development for Keigo Asano's sister and then just a fun day at the Beach with a Bleach Beach episode.

The set was good. I wish there was music on the menu screen though, the sets still feel odd lacking it and makes it feel of lesser quality than anime offered from other companies. For music the intro theme Shojo S from Scandal is wonderful and memorable, it gives me the same good feelings like the previous OP, Velonica did.

Definitely worth buying as we close in on the final 100 episodes of Bleach.",1357689600,,982,4.573863636363637
