1363977,5,B00004WG90,"This DVD is wonderful. It has all the sketches I remember from the early 90's plus a huge amount of bonus footage; Star Wars Movie sketches. Alot of the humor relates to British things like a sketch making fun of a famous tights (panty ho's) commerical. Or my personal favourite, House of Idiot.
Any one who remembers the ""House of Eliott"" will love this one. To top that off, three of the cast from House of Eliott make an appearance (Bea, Evy and Tilly)
I watched this with my little sister and she didn't get much of it at all as it's so dated and related to current events of the time it was made.
Still worth watching though!!",1049155200,4,631,4.310924369747899
1363978,5,B00004WG90,"""French and Saunders"" are Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, two incredibly talented British comedic actresses/writers. This collection of spoofs and skits comes courtesy of the BBC.
While featuring several movie spoofs (""Misery"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Thelma and Louise"", etc) that is not the only genre lampooned by these gifted writers/actors.
In addition to films, they also try their hand at spoofing music videos (their take on Guns-n-Roses ""November Rain"", with Jennifer Saunders taking on the Axl role and Dawn French that of Slash, is absolutely hysterical), fashion models, high-brow mini-series (Upstairs Downstairs), the Royals, etc.
Of the film spoofs, the ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" parodies stands out, as does a priceless take on ""Star Wars:Phantom Menace"". The ""Star Wars"" spoof is part of the BONUS selections on this DVD.
With tongue firmly in cheek, these two woman break down the fourth wall barrier and often interact out of character with each other, with uproarius results.
Among other topics, they turn their sharp wit to comment on the obvious superiority of Princess Diana over Sarah Ferguson (the DVD is dated 1994, which explains why the ""Star Wars"" skit is considered BONUS material) and how supermodel Jerry Hall ""has it all"".
The skits and lampoons here are right on the money, with detailed sets reproductions and props (many an inside joke on props are peppered throughout). Details count with any parody and are much appreciated here - From the costumes, down to the uncanny reproduction of Sigourney Weaver's voice (as portrayed by Jennifer Saunders) in the ""Aliens"" parody.
Jennifer Saunders has a gift with voices. She does not impersonate so much as interpret nuance (as Clarice in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and as Ripley in ""Aliens"").
As for pure, comedy sketches? If anyone has ever been inundated with mail order catalogs, there is an absolutely laugh-out-loud skit which centers around two women who have obviously purchased every catalog item ever produced.
This is an excellent, funny collection and one that you'll enjoy watching and watching again. I think once you've experienced the comic talents of these two very funny women, you'll be looking for additional ""French and Saunders"" collections.
Note please that I believe this DVD contains different material than the VHS tape, as there is no spoof on ""The Exorcist"" as indicated in some of the other reviews.
A quick rundown of some topics covered : ""Misery"", commercial spoofs, ""November Rain"" music video, Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, Jackie and Joan Collins, ""Aliens"", ""American Gladiators"", The Mama's and the Papa's music video, ""Silence of the Lambs"", catalog fans, Jerry Hall, ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"".
For the inside-joke fan, watch for references of Dawn French and windows or panes of glass.",1047513600,25,2856,5.237991266375546
1363979,5,B00004WG90,I have just become a fan of French and Saunders after having watched this dvd at a friends home.  I thought they were very funny.  I only wish they were on tv in the States.,1040688000,,173,3.914285714285714
1363980,4,B00004WG90,"I give them a high rating because I am an Anglophile and understand British slang very well. I suspect your mileage may vary, especially if you are unfamiliar with British idiom. If you subscribe to BBC America and like British comedy, pour yourself some tea (or warm beer) and sit down with this one.
British comedians, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders perform a series of sketches that are delightful send-ups of popular movies, such as ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Thelma and Louise"". They are supported by their usual stable of very funny people, most notably, a surprisingly butch commando in the ""Alien"" sketch. (Ms. Burke appears in ""Absolutely Fabulous"" as the nearly unintelligible Cockney go-getter who rushes into magazine meetings, throwing catch phrases at her ditzy staff and then rushing out.)
There are a few things that Americans might find puzzling, like a parody called ""House of Idiot"", but if you've watched PBS at all, it is not a stretch to figure out what they are doing.",1039996800,7,995,4.928571428571429
1363981,5,B00004WG90,"The Guns and Roses segment was priceless...I will never watch ""Silence of the Lambs"" the same again after the humour that Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders put into it...  These 2 women are extremely talented and beyond funny....",1039046400,,229,5.026315789473684
1363982,4,B00004WG90,"Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders have always made me laugh. On this DVD the highlight is their spoof on the movie Misery. Dawn French has Kathy Bates character down perfectly. I kept rewinding and belly laughing. Their take on Thelma and Louise will give you another big laugh as well as Jennifer saunders as Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. (they have the hair and look down perfectly). Some of the comedy I didn't undertsand for they are take off's of BBC shows that I have never heard of and that is why I gave this a 4 star rating instead of a 5. If you are a fan of ABFAB, you will be a fan of this DVD. Again, the Misery spoof is classic!",1026345600,,640,4.211382113821138
1363983,4,B00004WG90,"But is does tend to drag on.  I love the humorous take offs of the American movies, but there are also reference to British shows I am unfamiliar with.  I love Jennifer Saunders in AB FAB and missed Patsy so much.  Worth the time to watch as Jennifer perfects her skills.",1016496000,,271,4.2745098039215685
1363984,4,B00004WG90,"I really like Jennifer Saunders in ""Absolutely Fabulous"" and love Dawn French as ""The Vicar of Dilby"" but did not find this set of spoofs by the two actresses as entertaining as their later series. For an evening of mild entertainment for the average Anglophile, one can't beat the price, however, and while these episodes are not the best these two actresses have done, on their worst nights they are far funnier than most current U.S. sitcoms (and there are no commercial interruptions!).
The ""take-offs"" included in this DVD remind me of the old ""Saturday Night Live"" episodes on U.S. tv. You had to be of the times to fully appreciate the humor. Episodes built on current events have a way of becoming rapidly dated. For example, the scenes involving discussions by two ""royals-watchers"" of Fergie, Lady Di, and Dodi Fayed made me feel a bit sad although they were probably very funny at the time.
Several U.S. movies are spoofed, as was noted elsewhere -- ""Misery"" ""Thelma and Louise"" ""Aliens"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" but I did not see the others mentioned by the British reviewer. Perhaps the British and U.S. versions of this DVD differ? The soap opera spoof of the Collins sisters (Jackie and Joan--where they really sisters?) and ""The House of Elliot"" (""House of Idiots"") were quite good.  I watched bits of ""The House of Elliot"" but could never get into it and now I know why. I usually love period pieces, but sometimes they are a bit much.
All in all, this is a good buy, especially if you are interested in the early works of two very gifted British actresses. Jennifer Saunders has to have one of the most plastic faces around and in some ways her talents as an actress exceed her talents as a commedienne and writer.",1013990400,6,1734,4.666666666666667
1363985,5,B00004WG90,"Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders are undoubtedly one of Britains' most talented and popular comic duos. There are no limitations to their talents. They simply are unique!!
This thoroughly excellent video features French and Saunders spoofs of many classic movies such as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, THELMA AND LOUISE, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?, MISERY and THE EXORCIST. After watching these spoofs you will never be able to take any of the films seriously again! Its absolutley hilarious from beginning to end with its razor sharp wit and magnificent comic playing from all of the cast involved. Particuarly good spoofs are WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?, the take off of IN BED WITH MADONNA and the totally hilarious THE EXORCIST. Packed full of fun and laughs this video is essential to any comedy collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",971913600,20,839,5.131386861313868
1363986,5,B00004WG90,"Clever, funny and very entertaining writing and performances from these two extremely talented women.  What a pleasure that we in the US can be treated to their work!  The movie spoofs are SO funny and I pick up on even  more funny lines, etc. I didn't see on previous viewings - probably because  I was laughing so much!  Dawn French doing a southern accent...a riot.  Very highly-recommended!",914457600,3,394,4.8059701492537314

7925139,2,B00004WG90,"Found this particular series of episodes rather too dull, although I had seen them years ago on t.v. and hoped would find the same skits. Loved the later series about the vicar, with only French as the main figure, but this was quite disappointing after seeing The Vicar.",1430179200,,271,4.666666666666667

7925142,5,B00004WG90,"I should say from the start that I'm not a die-hard French & Saunders fan, in particular I can find Jennifer Saunders approach to humor rather unfunny at times.

7925144,1,B00004WG90,"Ok, humor is a very subjective thing.  It is definitely a case of one man's trash being another man's treasure.  Therefore, if you disagree with me on this one, I'm fully OK with that.

However, I couldn't wait until this movie was over!  In no other film in recent memory can I remember wanting so much to fall asleep during it.  I finally had to turn it off after about an hour a half of hoping (in vain) that it would get better.

Now, that's just my opinion of this particular work.  You may feel free to take it or leave it.  I promise not to be offended if ""F&S At the Movies"" had you rolling on the floor in laughter.  (I may not let you pick out my next movie, but I won't be offended! LOL)  British humor is kind of a ""take it or leave it"" kind of thing to the American mind in my experience.  Much of British humor has me in stitches.

I rented this because I enjoyed F&S's work on the Ab-Fab shows.  However, I think much of this film seems quite tailored to British culture, and many of the jokes will be lost on an American unless they happen to be a committed, dedicated and motivated Anglophile.  A large amount of this movie is spoofing a number of American movies though, so it's not ALL going to be alien to the average American.

For the record, I'm not slamming French and Saunders in general.  I do think that they are talented, and as I mentioned before, I have enjoyed Ab-Fab.  It's just that the specific content of the sketches in this movie did not resonate with my ""funny bone.""  Here and there were found some isolated jokes that were funny to me.  However, it was tedious wading through the rest of it to get to these islands of humor.

On the positive side, what I did see of this movie did not contain anything offensive and was not excessively immoral.",1209081600,2,1784,4.252976190476191
7925145,2,B00004WG90,"When they are funny no one does it better. But when they aren't, well, I never even watched thru to the end.",1130284800,,108,3.9545454545454546
