8630515,1,B00H7I0K3U,"Too much talk, not enough film of the music, ,bar, audience, etc. Glad I could rent and not waste money on a DVD

Spent a bit of time there from late 70's to mid 80's .  Mostly wasted while there. Lots of energy, some aggression, some good music, some bad.  Met some interesting people. Got bounced a couple of times after minor altercations-nothing serious enough to get banned.  Bouncers were rough but not overly so. My last memory was going behind the bar with permission to put in a contact that fell out so I could drive home.  Took me a half hour.  Somehow drove home  w/o major incident (got robbed by hitch hikers, minor accident, cop pulled me over and let me go w/o the keys )  . Drunk drivers had  it easy then, not proud of it. Shipped overseas on a job a few  days later and never got back to the area for 30 years at which point they had closed

Heard some really great  music there but never really knew who was playing, never cared to be honest.  So dark TBH and hard to get near the bands when it was crowded. Basically had to satisfy yourself with getting a drink, listening to the music and watching the crowd.

Too bad this was during a time before digital cameras /smart phones. Heck, even video cameras were a rarity then. So much history lost. Except our memories and between the alcohol and drugs much of that was lost too.",1522627200,,1348,4.2976190476190474
8630516,2,B00H7I0K3U,I guess there is a high bar for Indy docs because I was disappointed in the quality of this movie.,1510963200,,98,3.95
8630517,1,B00H7I0K3U,Not much footage of The Rat. The same 3 people talking over and over in some bedroom in Medford. ZERO Boston Hardcore footage. Oh well. Maybe next time.,1502236800,,152,4.464285714285714
8630518,3,B00H7I0K3U,"It was cool to take a quick trip down my musical memory lane but there was SO much left out from what was such a rich period.  Kind of surprised that there weren't more local musicians and regulars interviewed for some added color and commentary.  But I totally dug seeing images of the graffitied, backstage cave, Minehan and, of course, Mitch memorialized.",1455494400,,358,4.758064516129032
8630519,4,B00H7I0K3U,I think I have a couple of stories that were better than the movie but overall cool flick!,1438300800,,90,4.055555555555555
8630520,5,B00H7I0K3U,"Brought back so many memories I have of hanging at ""The Rat"".  Sitting on the jukebox, the awful ladies room, the beer soaked carpet.  But most of all the great bands that played down there.",1394668800,2,190,4.4
8630521,5,B00H7I0K3U,A GREAT job done b the team that put this documentary together - lots of good footage from a club that was the epicenter of the Boston club scene,1392854400,2,145,4.0344827586206895
8630522,3,B00H7I0K3U,"I spent a lot of time at the RAT. I loved the RAT. I enjoyed the interviews a lot, and I thought the portion about Mitch was good. I didn't care too much for the way the interviews were in blocks with live footage around it. I applaud the guys effort though.",1388707200,,258,3.980769230769231
