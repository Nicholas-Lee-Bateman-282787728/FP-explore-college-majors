1742471,5,B00006D28L,"Plot: There is a battle for the Earth, the Dragons of Heaven (The Seven Seals) want to save it, and the Dragons of Earth (The Seven Angles) want to destroy it. To be more exact, the Dragons of Earth want to destroy the planet because it has been corrupted by humans and then they can start over. One person, Kamui, has a decision to make that will effect everyone on Earth... he will be a head Dragon, but of Heaven, or of Earth? Once he makes this decision his ""twin star"" automatically becomes the head of the other Dragons.
My thoughts: So far, so good! Kamui is a jerk, basically, but I have a feeling that changes. Actually I think he may, in a way, switch personalities with this other character, Fuma, but I could be wrong. The character design is really good, which I hear is usual with Clamp (the creators of X, and also the creators of Magic Knights Rayearth, Card Captor Sakura, Chobits, etc). The plot is a little confusing, but I think with the next DVDs it'll get easier. There's also a lot of characters to keep straight, but it's helped by the handy booklet that came with the DVD (but don't look at it, episode 0, or the extras if you don't want any spoilers). The second DVD comes out tomorrow, and I can't wait to find out what happens!",1037577600,,1255,4.3446808510638295
1742472,4,B00006D28L,"I tend to like every anime I watch and this one i liked a little metter than most that i have seen. it was somewhat confusing as to what happens and the story. but as you watch each episode it gets better. I first didn't underatand why it started at episode 0. it smore of an introduction like a taste of things to come. you might want to get X the movie first then get into the series. the movie would explain a lot more in a short time, and it would alow you to understand what the series are about. Overall, the anime is great.",1037577600,,530,4.009433962264151
1742473,4,B00006D28L,"I must say that I've enjoyed the X series from what I've watched so far(around 8 episodes).  I do have complaints.  I don't like how slow it moves along.  I wish they had made the episode 1 a bit shorter on the character introductions, but hey, what can you do.
Also I'm dissapointed in the fight scenes.  They could have been so much better.  The ""hand to hand"" fights weren't too bad, but the sword fights were not very good.  White arcs of light represented the sword blades, and thats something I really hate in an anime, especially when its CG colored.  More time should have been put into the fight scenes.",1036972800,2,612,4.410714285714286
1742474,5,B00006D28L,"This set is mostly for those who like to collect valuables of anime ""trinkets"". The box is beautiful and the dvd comes in a black casing. It truely is a wonderful thing to have.
The Anime itself has many wonderful qualities too! The animation is terrific, and the story line is really interesting. If you have read the manga of this perticular anime, then you mostly know what is going to go on. It follows EVERY step of the manga series. I was personally impressed!
The story starts out with ""00: Omen"" episode. This episode just gives a general idea on what is going to happen throughout the series. Then all the episodes after that, actually, begins the story of the ""Dragons of the Earth, and Dragons of Heaven"".
I hope you enjoy!",1035936000,,734,4.526315789473684
1742475,5,B00006D28L,"There are many well-written, thorough reviews at Amazon[.com] on this series, so rather repeating what has been said, I just wish to cast my vote for this tremendous series.
As far as I'm concerned the movie version doesn't count, or it can be seen as a long trailer, since it only gives a mere taste of the characters, while wow-ing us with Xplosive action. At any rate, this series is top class in the story, art, and music. ""X"" is a passionate work that can be enjoyed by a diverse audience.
Other series I like are Kenshin, and Cowboy Bebop. If I were to compare them, I'd say take out the silly 'orro' moments of Kenshin, keeping the great drama and action, add a tad of witty humor and Xcellent music/artwork from Bebop, and you've got ""X,;"" a masterpiece, and now my favorite anime series.",1035244800,,796,4.496551724137931
1742476,5,B00006D28L,"Arguably the female manga team CLAMP's best creation, ""X"" was chopped up into a nice salad-sized feature film a few years back.  Though it was very well made, the movie leaves out quite a bit of the excellent original story.
This is the ""X"" TV series...and it's all filler, all killer.  I think it's safe to say that if you're a manga/anime fan, you've probably at least heard of this series.  Basically, the TV series serves as the ""official"" anime adaptation.  It does a top-notch job of bringing the manga and its characters to life, with splendiferous animation that fiercely rivals that of the movie.  The animation style is strikingly faithful to CLAMP's original design, complete with gorgeous characters (with chins that could possibly put one's eye out if not properly aimed), gloomy cityscapes, and special effects.  The effects are even enhanced with a pinch of that magical computer-generated animation everyone's been talking about.  It adds a whole other dimension.
That's all well and good, you say, but what's it ABOUT?  All right, I'll get you started:  the powers of Heaven (the good guys) and the powers of Earth (the bad guys) are about to wage war over the fate of the world, and each faction has sent seven harbingers (also called Seals, Angels, Dragons, etc., etc.) to do battle with each other.  One young man, Kamui Shiro, is being eyed by both sides as the one whose incredible psychic powers will tip the scales and seal the world's fate.  Needless to say, both Heaven and Earth want Kamui to play for their team (that's about as far as this first volume goes), but Kamui could care less.  Nevertheless, he becomes involved whether he likes it or not, and it may put those he cares about in danger as well.  The fate of the world's no joke, you know.  The story's a little bit deeper than that, as you may know, but there's not room here to go into it.  You'll just have to find out for yourself.  I will say this, though; the harbingers' own psychic abilities are a wonder to behold as they fight one another, and there's plenty of  violent action to complement the quickly-building story.
The Vol. 1 DVD contains the first three episodes, plus a ""bonus"" Episode 0 (nice marketing, Pioneer...), which is little more than a sneak peek at the whole series.  As far as extras, just a DVD credits screen, a trailer, and previews of other Pioneer anime titles (there's no ""previews menu"", though, like in ADV Films' DVD's; you've gotta just sit through them all).
In short, this is just a fantastic, and very dark, fantasy anime series set in modern times, and if you've read the funny books and/or enjoyed the full-length film, you'll simply revel in this stuff.  If you never have, don't worry.  You'll enjoy it just as much.",1034985600,2,2750,4.689583333333333
1742477,5,B00006D28L,"Whether you love or hate CLAMP, you can't ignore their impact on the anime and manga industry. While they're known best for their cute shoujo-style works (""Magic Knight Rayearth"", ""Cardcaptor Sakura""), one of their darkest manga series is ""X"", a story which has yet to be finished. Still, because the story was already marvelously laid out, the series was made into an anime movie simply called ""X"". The results created a movie that has a devout cult following yet failed to satisfy the majority of anime fans. The movie's biggest problem was that it attempted to cram so much of the manga into a very limited amount of time, leaving virtually no room for plot logic and character development. The ""X: TV"" series had decided to remedy that, bringing CLAMP's dark tale to life the way it was meant to be told.
""X: TV"" tells the story of Kamui, a bitter young man who has returned to Tokyo for reasons that are his own. He also happens to return when the Seven Seals are gathering to the city so that they may get ready for the Day of Judgement, when they are to battle the Seven Angels for the fate of the world. Little does Kamui know that he plays perhaps the biggest role in this drama, and it's not a role he is particularly interested in playing. Add in the possibility that two of his childhood friends, Fuma and Kotori, may also play a part in the upcoming battle and we have one of CLAMP's masterpieces.
The first three episodes on this first DVD are very slow paced, introducing many of the main characters more often than anything, but that's perhaps exactly what the series should do. In just one episode, ""X: TV"" gave more character depth to the Seven Seals than the entire movie ever did. And there's no lack of action, either. Kamui has power and he knows how to use it, and he puts that power to some good use even in the first episode. As for the characters themselves, they are surprisingly well developed for the little screen time they're allowed with such a huge character roster. As the series moves along, it'll be interesting to see how some of these characters truly grow.
Visually, ""X: TV"" puts the movie to shame, and that's saying a lot. While the ""X"" movie was flimsy on substance, it had undeniable style, showcasing some of the best animation available during that time. ""X: TV"" takes everything one step further, creating a breathtaking showcase for animation. Never before has hair looked so vibrant, have eyes looked so deep, and has movement glided so smoothly. The attention to detail in the series is outstanding, easily on par if not surpassing other great series like the almighty ""Cowboy Bebop"".
Soundwise, the score for ""X: TV"" compliments the visuals very well. The soundtrack isn't the most memorable of soundtracks, but what we do hear is very well thoughtout and pleasing. Concerning the dub, Pioneer has managed to create another wonderful dub on par with its magnificent ""Serial Experiments Lain"" dub, if not better. Don't expect the moment-defining performances like in ""Cowboy Bebop"", but do expect an English track where all the voice actors fit their roles and where they bring depth to their characters. Of course, if you prefer subs, the Japanese track is also good.
As for extras, Pioneer has given us a very surprising extra: ""Episode 0"". ""Episode 0"" was originally an episode-length promotional piece that had a small prequel story to ""X: TV"" and clips from the actual anime, showcasing scenes with all the major characters. The overall effect is pulled off very nicely, but be warned. Do not watch ""Episode 0"" if you do not wish to spoil some parts of the series, as it does show scenes very deep into the series.
Overall, the first DVD to ""X: TV"" is a magnificent title with the beginning to possibly a monumental series. While it's too early to see where the series will really head with only three episodes, ""X: [ONE]"" gives us very good reason to believe we won't be disappointed.",1034553600,,3939,4.6854256854256855
1742478,5,B00006D28L,"I got the whole series on VCD (subbed, of course). I simply could not wait for the DVDs to come out!
If you have seen X the movie, and you think it [it was awful], I don't blame you. Lack of character development, lack of a good story, lack of pretty much everything save a lot of action and beautiful animation. I simply did not care for the characters, except, possibly, for Kamui at the very end.
Well, the series fixes ALL of X the movie's problems. You will fall in love with the characters. You will gnaw your fingernails with anticipation when you see one of the Seven Seals fall in love with one of the Seven Angels. You will wish that destiny was not so defined (a major, MAJOR theme in the movie) when characters get the axe (or the sword). Each character is well-rounded, with an interesting history, and natural relationships that are not too glaringly obvious. Plus, you lose none of the action and animation that are so prevalant in the movie.
The best part of the series, I think, is the fact that each of the Seven Seals (they are called the Dragons of Heaven in the movie, although in the series only Kamui is called a 'Dragon of Heaven'; everyone else on his side are called the Seven Seals, and on the other side are the Seven Angels) gets his or her own episode that focuses on his or her character and character history. So, unlike the movie, you actually FEEL for the characters in this one.
Oh, and the series is very different from the movie in quite a few ways. Most notably, the birth of the swords, who dies and who lives in various parts of the series, and the relationships between some of the characters.",1034121600,,1634,4.378289473684211
1742479,5,B00006D28L,"Though the first disc worth of episodes moves rather slowly, this is shaping up to be an extremely entertaining series. Epsiodes 1 & 2 are mostly an introduction to our main characters, and we learn very little about the plot itself. However, episode 3 really packs it all in, giving the viewer a good overview of the two sides and plenty of hints as to what's to come.
Though many shows in anime deal with the end of the world, the stylistic approach in ""X"" helps to grab your attention. Kamui, the lead character, is your typical unwilling hero who wants nothing to do with his destiny. More to the point, he begins this series as quite the anti-hero, and there's little to redeem him. Luckily, the creators don't weigh down the character with melodramatic angst. He is, quite unashamedly, selfish. So, it's up to the supporting cast to show us just why the world deserves to be saved, along with Kamui himself.
One word of warning: if you don't want to have certain plot points spoiled for you, do NOT watch the Extras part of the disc, or the Episode 0 included. Skip straight to Episode 1, and don't look back. I wasn't warned in time, so certain major plot elements have been ruined for me. However, getting to those points looks to be the fun part!",1033430400,19,1255,4.508771929824562

""X [ one ] "" is a hit! A wonderfully composed prequel to X/1999 so often seen in Anime Clubs as the one at Cabrillo High School, this anime has proven to be a thriller. Viewed by retired members, officers, and current members of the club, they have given it 5 stars and 6 thumbs up. If one has read the Animerica series featuring the 'X' series and have enjoyed it, then they will definitely be pleasantly surprised at this first dvd with the first 3 episodes including episode 0! The series features a closer look at the events occurring before the destructive battles and gives an in depth look at each character of the Seven Dragons of Earth (or the Seven Angels) and the Seven Dragons of Heaven (or the Seven Seals). Along with a look at 'Kamui' and his friends Kotori, Fuma, and 3 other previously unseen characters. I recommend this anime to anyone who enjoyed the original movie and the comic series.

1742511,5,B00006D28L,"I watched this anime after completely falling in love with Subaru from Tokyo Babylon and hearing that he's in X as well.  At first I thought that Kamui is actually Subaru.  Boy was I wrong.  Boy was I happy that I was wrong.

X is one of those anime shows (like the many that are out there) that so far seems to be very into the psyche of the characters that play a role in them.  There's surely at least one character that someone can relate to on a deeper level.  Kamui, the angry, skulking teenager who's holds the key to change the world, is just dripping with potential character developement, like the rest of the characters, all of whom are woven into the story with the clear intent of having important roles to fill in later episodes.

  Just a word of warning though, episode 0 is sort of like an extra long review of the series, revealing a whole mess of turning points in the story that could probably be considered spoilers.  In a sense though, it doesn't matter if you watch episode 0 first, because the series, so far, seems to be all about fufilling ones destiney, and I know I'm gonna have to see all the episodes now, to find out HOW this destiney will be filled.  If you like suspense and surprises, though, skip epi 0 and go on to epi 1.

  A word of warning.  If you want to get into anime, make sure you have money for it.  It's pretty addicting and expensive.",1098489600,2,1382,4.277992277992278
1742512,5,B00006D28L,"One thing you have to understand is, this is not entirely made to be an action anime. It is mainly meant for girls (shojo) which means it deals a lot with emotion and relationships.

The action in the series is great, the fights etc. If you are only looking for action though, you should skip most of the series, as only about 30% of it is fighting.

The return of Subaru Sumeragi and Seishiro Sakurazuka was very well done and pleased many Tokyo Babylon fans like myself.

The plot is simple enough: Dragons of Heaven (the seven seals)= good guys versus the Dragons of Earth (the seven harbingers)=bad guys. The Dragons of Heaven want to save mankind while the Dragons of Earth want a revolution. This is hard to follow for the simple minded though, because it is more deep than something like Dragonball Z which is pure action.

There are some things bad about this anime however:

1. It is very redundant, you can skip an episode and not miss much.

2. actually, i cant think of anything else

The good things about this are:

1. Great theme song

2. Fights are true to life, the good guys are more hesitent to kill than the bad guys.

3. good voice acting",1098230400,,1159,4.4245283018867925

I'm not impressed by the animation of the series. In the movie they drawn the characters much better than in the series.

1742514,5,B00006D28L,"I love this show!! The first DVD is confusing to some (especially the first episode) but if you ride it out it becomes a wonderful experience. The concept is complex and the characters are multilayered, you can't help but fall in love with them. I really felt what all they were all feeling. I personally enjoy the mystery and the dark ideas about the end of the world but its all underlined with hope, even if it is a little hard to see. Even, in the end, if you dislike the show you can't deny that the music is beautiful. It was probably the first thing that attracted me to it. All the songs transport you and make you feel the emotions.

Kamui must decide to save the future or it will go into total collapse. The sides of good and evil are represented by the Dragons of Heaven and of Earth respectively.

1742533,5,B00006D28L,"The Clamp Cooperative's original manga series for 'X' was a complex, doom-filled apocalyptic vision.  Two groups, the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth are enmeshed in a struggle for ascendancy over Tokyo that would ultimately decide the fate of the world.  Those of earth seek to destroy in order to recreate the world anew, and those of Heaven seek to preserve and revitalize the existing sources of power.  Into this struggle steps Kamui, a young man who has returned to Tokyo to reclaim the Shinken or divine sword.  In doing so, he will make a series of decisions that bring about the final resolution of the struggle.
When a feature length film was made from the manga, it became painfully obvious that this is too much story to be communicated in 90 minutes.  Almost twenty major characters are involved and the needs of the limited format ensured that only a few received enough attention to gain definition.  The plot itself is complex, and depends on the characters to progress.  The best the film could do was to be a beautifully crafted and acted but infinitely fragile production.  The result left everyone a bit dissatisfied.  Unwilling to write off Rintaro's efforts completely, director Yoshiaki Kawajiri undertook to remake the story as a full-length television series.  Insisting on a high level of production values, especially for the graphics and musical work, he has managed not only to surpass the film, but also to improve upon the story telling of the manga.
This first DVD sets the gothic, art nouveau styling of the story, sketches out the bones of the plot, and begins to bring the characters on stage.  This is no small task, and the viewer is warned to read the accompanying character guide and be willing to tolerate a bit of confusion before everything is sorted out and the characters have developed sufficient personalities so that the plot and the cast begin to mesh.
The key characters to come on board in the beginning are the trio of Kamui Shirou, Fuma Monou and his sister Kotori Monou.  Kamui, who knew the Monou's as children, has returned to Tokyo.  Despite his every effort to keep his old friends at a distance, fate takes charge.  Because Kamui's own decision about his role in the coming cataclysm will force a parallel decision from Fuma, and brings Kotori into a tragic conflict between duty and desire.  Two other characters of early interest (both Dragons of Heaven) are Sorata Arisugawa, an unlikely priest from Mt. Kouya, and Hinoto, a dreamseer who keeps the Dragons organized until Kamui can make his decision.
At this early stage, this series shows every sign of being a landmark effort.  Whether it will finally succeed will depend on Kawajiri's ability to tame the complex story and large cast.  So far the director has proven up to the challenge.  This series is well worth continued attention.",1045440000,15,2861,4.851851851851852
1742534,5,B00006D28L,"Volume of of the series is a bit of a slow burn, but it allows you to really get to know the characters, what drives them, and a glimpse into their powers. This is something X The Movie didn't get a chance to do at all. I watched the film a few times and still had trouble figuring out who was who aside from a few key characters.
You mainly get to touch on the 7 Dragons of Heaven, Kamui, Karen, Seiichiro, Yuziriha, Subara, Lady Arashi, and Soroto who is my personal favorite character. Essentially because he makes me laugh a lot. You do get to meet a few of the Dragons of Earth, but not a whole lot of them. Overall this is really a stepping stone into the real meat of the story. Not that these aren't interesting, because they are, but it gets so so much better in the later episodes.
I love the storylines in X, even though Kamui is the typical anti hero which is usually an anime staple he is done so wonderfully. The director took great care into making sure he was both fierce and yet there was a reason behind his ferocity. The musical score is also fantastic, during some of the more intense moments the score was flawless in increasing the tension. You can tell that much attention to detail went into this project.

Its sorta like the Utena Movie and Series, the movie is the entire series in under two hours, but still pretty. In the series, Kamui seems to be a tad bit cold, and there are some characters that took me a minute to place, but thats only because I've seen the movie. This series is great to start out on and you don't even need to see the movie or the manga! And the opening song, ""eX dream"" is great!!!",1043107200,2,494,4.15625

Kamui must choose which side to fight for. As he is now, he wants nothing to do with the battle. His destiny has not been determined...or has it?

This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again!

7967272,5,B00006D28L,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,7,4144,4.466225165562914
7967273,5,B00006D28L,"I saw X/1999 the movie first before I saw the anime and I was afraid that the TV series would be just as bad, but I still had a lingering desire to see it and the reviews on Amazon made me decide that I was going to give it a chance.

I watched it and it became one of my favorie anime series, with it's characters that you grow to love within a short time span, the growing angst and tension between the lovable cast, this is a must see for an anime fan!",1139616000,,455,3.8404255319148937
7967274,5,B00006D28L,"I actually gave this product a bad review a while ago. I think it reminded me of the X movie too much. The first episode is basically a preview of the series, while the next episodes are an introduction to several of the main characters of the series.

After watching the first two dvds, I have come to respect the creators of this series. The series does some justice to the manga, which I have started looking at.

I figured out the plot from the X movie, but that hasn't stopped me from being interested in this series. Kamui is portrayed differently from the movie. He is much darker and barely ever shows emotion. It will be interesting to see how he changes throughout the series. Sorata is quite interesting as well. The flashback scenes of him as a young monk are entertaining, and remind me of Evangelion in a way. Each character is extremely important to the series, and more are introduced in the next dvd.

The only negative thing about this series so far in my mind is the fact that the dvds only contain 3 episodes each. They did this because they realized they could get more money. They definetly could of fit more episodes on one dvd, like Cowboy Bebop did. Still, this series is quite interesting, and it's one of the few anime series I have seen where I was more interested in the characters than the story.",1126483200,2,1326,4.448559670781893
7967275,5,B00006D28L,"Let me start of by saying that this has now become one of my favorite anime series of all time.  The story line is incredibly complex, centering around the destiny of Kamui, who will ultimately decide his destiny and the fate of the world.  Along the way there are hard decisions, heartbreak and tragedy, which all help to develop the plot and the characters more fully.  Obviously since this is a CLAMP series there are some twists and turns along the way that you wouldn't see coming, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this to any anime fan, or really anyone for that matter.  While it can be confusing at times with so many characters and so many things going on, this is well worth the effort to sort through some of that and come to the heart of it.",1122681600,,779,4.308219178082192
7967276,4,B00006D28L,"Friday, July 01, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Sprawling ensemble apocalyptic anime

My first Clamp experience this anime was a sweeping story detailing personal choice and fate in the face of an impending apocalyptic choice.  Seven guardians of Heaven and Seven of Earth are set to square off for the future direction of the planet, each group's most powerful member is an individual of dual existence named Kamui.  If the first Kamui chooses destruction of the earth, the second Kamui is awakened to face him and vice versa.  Most interestingly though is the compelling story lines of the supporting characters, each is given a suitable vignette and even the `villains' are thoughtful and interesting.  I particularly liked the arc of the love story of Sorata and Arashi.  The former a gregarious monk and the latter a quiet introverted dark beauty.  He is fated to die for the woman he loves and when he declares that to her on the `first date' she's suitably taken aback, but watching her slowly come to love him was a nice romantic touch.  Both Kamuis intentionally tend to mirror those around them and fail to provide much individuality until the end game.  Colors on the DVD were somewhat muted, but the art was stylized and very good.  In Clamp style many of the characters are androgynous to the point where you can't tell which lead to some confusing moments.  This was an enjoyable 20+ episode series.  Recommended.",1120348800,2,1412,4.765432098765432
