Amazing what someone can talk someone else into buying just because they like it.",1504137600,,185,4.470588235294118

8544872,5,B009X66E9I,"It is a story of an actual famous""Rock Star"" who was making lots of ""$$$$"" with his band.  The story is told by the actual Rock Star and in his own words; he starts from his humble beginnings to where he reached the top of his career and then what transpired that changed his life and the life of all around him.

Inspiring, uplifting, hope and faith filled, real down to earth battles as well as spiritual battles that were even greater !  All leads you to a place where, although it's unexpected, we learn that there is no such thing as a ""coincidence.""

When we first saw this film we saw so many possibilities in it and we had to get our own copy.  Once we purchased it, we began having friend over & showing them the film; we also let them borrow it to show other friends,etc.  As a matter of fact we have had the film out all over our groups of friends, family, church, work, etc. Many have purchased their own copy to pass along to their groups!

The film is in ""SPANISH' with sub-titles in ""ENGLISH,"" but ""NOTHING""  is lost in the translation!  The effects this film will have in your life will be in the message that it carries, which is one that is ""UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD.""",1383004800,3,1184,4.297297297297297
