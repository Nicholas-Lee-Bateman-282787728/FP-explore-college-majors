8173024,4,B000MV9EVS,I had this in my collection for awhile and finally watched it for the first time.  It's a great revenge western taking place after the civil war.  Giuliano Gemma became famous after 'A PISTOL FOR RINGO' and made a number of early westerns of which this one shines the most.  A confederate major refuses to surrender and plans on robbing Fort Yuma.  Gemma plays an ex rebel who's hired by the army to warn the fort.  Many double crosses ensue and the excellent showdown at the end round out the testosterone. Great direction from Giorgio Ferroni which has many horror film elements throughout and a early standout music score from Ennio Morricone who is co-billed with Gianni Ferrio but you'll be able to tell which is which.  Wild East Productions continue to be the masters of the Spaghetti Western product boasting excellent sound and widescreen picture clarity. Recommended.,1274313600,,877,4.891891891891892
