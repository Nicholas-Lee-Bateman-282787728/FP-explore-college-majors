8168490,1,B000MGB9CU,"So the show is called ""60 Minutes"" right? Why, then, is this a 14-minute segment about MMA? I bought this video thinking that it was a documentary. I wanted an inside look at the world of MMA. But it was none of that. It is a 14-minute segment, which has an interview with Renzo Gracie and a few other fighters. They talk about their views on MMA. That's it. Not worth your money!!!",1196294400,6,382,4.2465753424657535
