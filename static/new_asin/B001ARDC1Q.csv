3466451,5,B001ARDC1Q,"I was pleasantly surprised!  I've found that many of the movies for teen girls out there focus on appearance and send the message that a girl needs to be pretty and have a guy fall for her in order to be validated as a person.  While this movie has a little of that, it is overall a fantastic guide, especially to tweens and teens, about rough times and decisions and how to deal with them.  Themes touched on are sportsmanship, friendship, jealousy, apologizing, forgiveness, family problems, goals, timing of goals, the work that meeting goals takes, team work, etc.
I debated giving the film 4 stars rather than 5 because the plot isn't exactly original, but a film that leaves me wanting to be a better person deserves 5 stars.",1259452800,2,731,4.607692307692307
3466452,4,B001ARDC1Q,"Most times I tend to stay away from the Disney Channel and all its saccharine goodness, and at the best of times I'm only a casual fan of soccer. But family obligations had me parked in the living room one evening and checking out this movie, and it wasn't really so horrible a time. HER BEST MOVE doesn't flash the sublime cinematic creds of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;or the Amanda Bynes-powered appeal of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-s-the-Man-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000FIHN84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She's the Man (Widescreen Edition)</a>, but it's still a positive and very watchable dramedy and ideally suited for family viewing, especially if you have little girls and if they're into soccer.

15-year-old Sara Davis may be a soccer phenom (and a bit of a ballhog) but, in many ways, she's your typical teenaged girl, trying not to get mown down by pressures of school and social peers and all that stuff we all went thru when we were that insecure age. Sara carries the added baggage of a taskmaster of a dad who relentlessly pushes her in her sport. But Sara genuinely loves soccer and has a long shot at making the National Development Team, and so she falls in line, sacrificing her time at being just a normal girl and hanging out with her best friend, missing out on her dance classes and on a possible romance with that reclusive but cute teen photographer. The predictable fallout is that Sara is gradually succumbing to stress, what with her being bombarded from all sides, expected to meet all sorts of obligations. Sadly, not even her supportive mom's sneaking dollops of ice cream into those yucky nutritional blended drinks is enough of an upside.

HER BEST MOVE doesn't try to pull a fast one on you. It's a solid picture, straightforward and familiar thru and thru, from Sara's character arc to the ultra-competitive on-field rival to that all-important big final game. Also familiar are those themes of self-discovery, personal choice, and parents exerting too much pressure on their kids to excel in youth sports, to the detriment of these kids' enjoyment in simply being kids. And, frankly, the soccer matches won't dazzle anyone. It all comes down to the cast's performances, and, at the movie's core, is Leah Pipes's performance. Leah Pipes isn't a Barbie playing at soccer. There's a realness to her and an honesty in how she demonstrates her character's self-consciousness and anxieties and in her tentative steps toward romance. She grounds this movie. To quote from her interview with the popculturemadness website: ""I was so thrilled to get the part of Sara because I was able to combine my two passions: acting and soccer."" And sure enough, Leah is pretty convincing as a soccer player. It helps, too, that, even with its crop of clichs the film doesn't get too preachy or silly and that the screenplay doesn't resort too much to overwrought and contrived high school schtick. In summing up, there's enough here that's thought-provoking and substantial and engaging to separate HER BEST MOVE from the pack of run-of-the-mill teen flicks endlessly parading thru the Disney Channel.",1247961600,2,3346,5.445086705202312
3466453,5,B001ARDC1Q,Its a very good family movie.  Especially if your children are into soccer!  :-),1238889600,,80,4.642857142857143
3466454,4,B001ARDC1Q,"This movie was pretty much what I expected! My 5 yr old loved it and it was nice not to have to worry about any ""adult subjects"" popping up! Would definitely recommend it!",1226880000,2,171,4.212121212121212
3466455,5,B001ARDC1Q,"This is a great film for the whole family.  The story is about a high school girl who is a great soccer player, but who has sacrificed some of normal life outside of soccer and how she reconnects with her friends and her life while pursuing her goal of being the youngest member ever on the U.S. National Development Team.  The film is funny, inspiring and just great.",1219104000,5,368,4.397058823529412
3466456,5,B001ARDC1Q,"My girls (ages 9 & 14) loved ""Her Best Move""!! We were fortunate to screen the film early at the Chicago Int'l Children's Film Festival. It's a refreshing film, with a great message. There are so few films for teens and tweens like this! My girls play competitive soccer and they were amazed at how exciting and realistic the soccer action was. Our whole family liked it (including my son who prefers little league to soccer!)",1217894400,11,426,4.618421052631579

In high school, with her best friend (Lalaine) , Sara meets school photographer Josh (Drew Tyler Bell), who competes for her time with her soccer. She must then, decide on her dad's hope of her making the U.S. National soccer team, or missing out on school, experiences, and her relationship with her boyfriend.",1398297600,,498,5.085365853658536

3466460,4,B001ARDC1Q,"I initially watched this movie because I have been a fan of Scott Patterson, since he was on Gilmore Girls.  I really enjoyed this movie because the main characters learned some very valuable lessons by the end of the film.  She learned that soccer wasn't everything, and that she needed to enjoy her whole life, including soccer.  The relationships she had with her Dad and her Mom were very realistic, and her best friend, her dance instructor, her soccer coach, and the new boy in her life, all added to her seeing that there is a lot to life, other than just sports, and you can enjoy ALL the different parts if you just take the time.",1334966400,3,639,4.444444444444445
3466461,5,B001ARDC1Q,"This is a FAMILY movie.  If you want ""edgy"", this movie is not for you.  But it's a wholesome story, well told, and, while the turf is familiar, the characters have surprising depth and the plot manages to avoid most cliches.
If your kids like soccer, this film definitely will appeal to them.",1276128000,2,293,4.509433962264151
