8620899,3,B00G5GNYVA,"This disc contains three documentaries, so I'll review each one individually.

In Search Of The Real Frankenstein-  I admit, I was little disappointed when I found out this disc was mostly episodes of History Channel shows put together, but I like this one.
This episode of Decoding The Past has a really eerie atmosphere that is completely appropriate for the source material with some nicely disturbing reenactments.
It's about exploring the scientists that may have inspired Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein. and it is fascinating to learn about all these twisted, morbid experiments that went on during the early days of science. It's also interesting to learn about what the people at the time genuinely believed could be done with electricity.
In typical History Channel fashion, it might overplay the whole ""Was Frankenstein inspired by true events?!!!!""-thing, which of course makes the truth sound more exciting than it is, but for me, it's all part of the fun with these atmospheric documentaries. This is definitely a nice addition to the disc.

Frankenstein- This is an episode of In Search Of History, it's pretty okay. It's a simple, straight forward bio on Mary Shelley's life and the creation of Frankenstein. I personally like watching old episodes of A&E's Biography, so I thought this would be right up my alley, however, it's presentation leaves a bit to be desired.
After the first ten minutes, the editing slows down and most of the time you just see a lot of slow zoom-ins on historical paintings, no reenactments, and there weren't that many 'talking head' interviews. The interviews they had were informative but kinda bland. even by talking head standards. There also wasn't that much of an attempt to create an eerie atmosphere.
The content itself is fine, it was interesting learning about Mary Shelley's life, especially her relationship with her husband and how they clashed with the rest of society.
The only problem with the actual content I can think of is that sometimes a talking-head will make an assertion that an element from Shelley's book was inspired by something in real life when of course there is little evidence to prove it. For example, someone said that Shelley's was criticizing the sexist-scientific community by writing Dr. Frankenstein as man who tried to use science to create life himself without a woman (then, of course, things go wrong), but the person doesn't explain how the scientific community at the time was using science in a sexist way in real life.
This a watch only for informative purposes, the presentation is a little weak and it does feel like you are watching an old TV episode, but it's okay.

It's Alive! The True Story Of Frankenstein-  This is the only documentary that is a stand alone special, an A&E production exploring the legacy of Frankenstein in culture, with a slight emphasis on his history on film.
  This is the best feature on the disc and is the reason I bought it in the first place. It really highlights all the flaws with the previous documentary. Unlike that one, this film has some real energy in its presentation. It has an atmosphere, though not an eerie one, more of a mysterious/dark mystical one. Which is appropriate given that the film is about exploring Frankenstein's long often hidden history.
  The talking heads in this film are more interesting because most of them have a real passion for the subject matter, and often have some keen insight into the movies discussed because they either were huge fans, close relatives, or were the creators of the movies themselves.
  It was fun learning about the production of the earliest Frankenstein movies, as well as the more obscure stuff like the Spook Shows, or more obscure films like Frankenstein Unbound. They also do a short bit on Frankenstein as a commercial character, exploring the monsters profitable exploits through expensive vintage posters, commercials, and toys. They really go into detail about the history and legacy of the character
  If there are any flaws, it would be that it has weird structure. First, it focuses on the first Universal film, then it goes back to talk about the history of the book, then briefly discusses the Thomas Edison silent film, then it focuses on Universal's Bride of Frankenstein. Throughout the whole film, they bounce back and forth on the timeline, but I guess this may have been done to keep the audience's interest. It is the longest of the three documentaries and a straight-forward, linear, play-by-play of the timeline might have made it more boring to watch.
  This feature alone makes the disc worth buying, especially since it's hard to find anywhere else.

I'd say this is worth buying, if you are huge Frankenstein fan and you want to learn about the story's origin and legacy, for that i'd say it's worth $5.00. but you have to keep in mind you are paying to see History Channel's reruns. If you can find these documentaries cheaper, do so. If already know A LOT about Frankenstein, then these T.V series documentary episodes may not satisfy you. Also, there is a bit of trade off. you are given 2.5 hours of content, but rewatchability is going to vary from person to person, so keep in mind whether or not you think you'll get a lot of use out of having the physical disc around.

Overall given the price, it's a decent purchase for curious Frankenstein fans like me",1496361600,,5386,4.88170865279299
8620900,5,B00G5GNYVA,"Great set of 3 documentaries.  The second is the best in terms of the creation of the original story, but all three have interesting parts.  The third is more focussed on the film versions, but this is also engaging.",1458000000,2,216,4.512820512820513
8620901,5,B00G5GNYVA,"I bought this disc solely for ""It's Alive, the True Story of Frankenstein."" I had recorded it when it originally aired on A&E and was delighted to finally see it get released on DVD. The documentary follows the story of Frankenstein from book, to film, through the making of Kenneth Brannagh's film. Lot's of interviews from historians, actors and ""recreated audio interviews."" Compression is so-so due to having three programs on 1 disc, but for the price you cannot go wrong.",1446422400,5,477,4.901234567901234
