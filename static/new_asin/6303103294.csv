Its almost scary how much this animated series influenced/affected me and who I've become. Little else has ever moved me and held me captivated to the extent Robotech did. I was almost catatonic when it went off the air. Not only is the animation often breathtaking (some episodes better than others...), but the storyline and characters were mesmerizing. I hope that the entire three part series becomes available on DVD someday.",984268800,,549,4.7894736842105265
