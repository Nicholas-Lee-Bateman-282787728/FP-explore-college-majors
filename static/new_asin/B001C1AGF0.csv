8285631,1,B001C1AGF0,"This copy of the masterpiece Histoire dO is garbage, I never had seen something like this: all the womens pubis have been covered with a ridiculous heart destroying the erotic sense of the film, a lot of scenes were damaged, the artists  who made the movie and you are treated without respect. If the producer of the copy feels shame selling this movie can try with Disneys movies.",1435449600,,381,4.602941176470588
8285632,5,B001C1AGF0,I recently bought two copies of this movie from two different Amazon-based sellers and I'm amazed that a)the uncut edition of The Story of O actually exists and b)it could bought on Amazon. Thanks to Amazon I'm in the process of building a DVD library that puts nearly all of those now-defunct mom & pop video stores to shame.,1393459200,2,326,4.5423728813559325
