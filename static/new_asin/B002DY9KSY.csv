3914057,5,B002DY9KSY,I LOVE Naruto and am trying to complete my DVD collection.  My cousins and I are planning a Naruto marathon soon and I am in a hurry to get all the DVDs.  THANK YOU!!!,1356134400,,167,3.8823529411764706
3914058,3,B002DY9KSY,"I Would Like Viz Media To start putting these on blu-ray or box sets but these are good to collect. If You Finishing Things then try to stick with Naruto throughout even though it has filler. Because what is after that...is something incredible...something EPIC...something inspiring, amazing, so - Or you could just call it ""Naruto: Shippuden"" PEACE!",1353888000,,351,5.175438596491228
3914059,3,B002DY9KSY,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 16 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes two hundred and six through two hundred and twenty of Naruto.  The first two discs contain five episodes, while the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The set includes the conclusion of the Kurenai and Yakumo arc, the story about the Beauty of Nature, the Ninja Dropouts arc, the story about Menma, and members of the Artisan village trying to capture Gaara.

The first extra in the set is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of twenty pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview for Naruto: Shippuden, which runs for about two and a half minutes; however, the audio is mastered a little on the soft side.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to four pages of advertisements for Shonen Jump titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""DVD Trailers"" takes you to a trailer for Naurto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom.  The final link in the extras menu is labeled as ""Game Trailers,"" and it has trailers for: Naruto Shippuden: Ninja Council 4, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2, Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, and Naruto: The Broken Bond.

While there were some good episodes on this set, Viz Media skimped more on the special features than on the other sets.  One of the most notable differences is the fact that this set does not include a ""From Sketch to Screen"" feature, which had been included on the fifteen previous sets.  The lack of features on this set is rather disappointing, since this is the last box set for the first Naruto anime series.  I was expecting Viz Media to try to go to a little more effort to wrap up this series before moving on to Naruto: Shippuden.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then Naruto Uncut Box Set 16 should be added to your collection.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1289260800,,2182,4.528061224489796
3914060,5,B002DY9KSY,Mostly suitable for all ages. A bit violent at times though. This is the last of the original series and if you made it this far why would you not want to get it?,1284249600,,162,3.7941176470588234
3914061,5,B002DY9KSY,"My favorite character in Naruto is Gaara, so I like it when he's in the story. Even though this isn't part of the original story line, I'm happy they decided to put him in a least a part of the fillers. yes and Gaara's fight is the best fight out of all of the filler episodes. yes the filler's dragged on and it felt like I was seeing the same thing over and over with different characters but this was a great closing to all the dragging on. I was just basically going through the motion watching all of this b/c I love Naruto I have to watch alllll the episodes so I stuck with box set 11 through 16 and my eyes finally got bigger as soon as GAARA OF THE DESERT appeared.",1271635200,,674,4.037313432835821
3914062,5,B002DY9KSY,"As Vol. 16 of Naruto comes to a conclusion.  So do the affairs/travels/exploits that Naruto, Sakura, Ten-Ten, Garra, Rock Lee, Hinata, Neji, Kiba and all the other characters that encompass this.  They are now on their way to putting the things that held them back aside.  As Naruto leaves to train with ""Pervy Sage"" in the last episode of this volume.  Everyone vows to get themselves stronger and powerful in their area of expertise so that they can keep up with Naruto.  Just about every episode of this volume are filled with action with the majority of the characters getting their chance to shine throughout.  Worth the price of admission and worthy of your attention as well. I've enjoyed the series as a whole.  But this one really sets up nicely for what soon follows...the next step of the Naruto series.

Naruto Shippuden",1265241600,6,832,4.769230769230769
3914063,4,B002DY9KSY,"I bought this because Cartoon Network canceled Naruto when it had just over TEN episodes left! (so stupid)

The important thing is this set DOES have our beloved English cast. I was worried after having to sit through the Japanese track watching these online. The English cast are better actors in my opinion (and yes, I watch and enjoy Japanese tracks for other shows).

Well, I've read people raving over the Uncut set. I'm here to say I preferred it on CN. I am deducting a star because There Is No English Captioning. The subtitles are for the Japanese track only and don't fit what the characters are saying. I sometimes like to compare localization this way, but sometimes I'd rather the words fit. This is going to confuse my mother who is hearing impaired. Deaf people may be confused by all the foreign references (like sama).

CN always had good captions with perfect timing. This shows that Viz cut corners on this expensive boxset. We're actually getting LESS than if it had finished on air. The episodes are great. This product is a disappointment.

Please go to Viz's website and demand English captions for the Shippuden boxset!",1257292800,5,1143,4.757575757575758
