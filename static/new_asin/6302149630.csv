432187,3,6302149630,"If you are wanting a horror movie that will give chills then look elsewhere. This film is not meant to be serious, its purpose is to entertain rather than scare.  I actually use the term 'horror' very  loosely when applying it to this movie, really it is just a camp, college  movie with a horror element.  The main plot doesn't really revolve around  the funny little creatures, rather it focuses on the attempts of two rival  gangs (the Gammas and the Betas) to out 'prank' each other and claim the  much coveted pranking crown.  The Ghoulies do however provide some comical  moments and some of the effects are entertaining.
It is hard to believe  that this film was made in the nineties. It has a very dated mid-eighties  feel to it, due to the use of directing and scripting styles that were  popular during that era, as well as the use of gratuitous nudity, which has  become expected of films within this category.  These are not complaints,  they actually make the movie watchable.  After all, the eighties was the  decade which invented this genre and to present it in any other format just  wouldn't fit.  The acting is probably also slightly better than one would  normally expect fom such a movie, but then again, the script provides no  particular challenges.
There are similarities to movies such as Critters  and Gremlins, but Ghoulies never comes close to achieving the same  standards.  That's not to say that it isn't worth watching, just don't  expect too much, and if you enjoy silly films, such as Troma's offerings  then you will undoubtedly enjoy this.  If you can get it cheap, then this  is overall, a fun movie to have in your collection.",959472000,4,1664,4.684027777777778
432188,1,6302149630,"Ghoulies III is a cheap excuse for a Ghoulies film.  Stupid NEW story line, NO gore, NO horror, and very little horror.  The story, a cheap slapped-together piece of filth, about a comic that brings talking Ghoulies  to life.  And, just for kicks, there is some nudity thrown in.  Don't  waste your time with this ""horror-comedy"".",955584000,2,330,4.803571428571429
432189,5,6302149630,"As the title implies, in Ghoulies III, the gang goes to college. I'm not sure if they were actually enrolled or not or if they went to any classes. But let's be honest. Is that the real purpose of college? Everyone knows  that the american college student's raison de etre is to drink mass  quantities of beer, sneak into the all-girls dormitory, and, above all,  PARTY! And this is exactly what the Ghoulies do (in addition to  disembowling a few nerds along the way). Why would a bunch of terrorizing  little demons be any different?  In fact the Ghoulies make a seemless  transition into the college environment. No one finds it strange that,  among the regular crowd of humans, there are a bunch of grotesque knee-high  demons scurrying around. This is a testament to the validity of America as  the great and noble melting pot. The spirt of America truely knows no  boundries. It doesn't discriminate against race, colour, sex, handicap, or  even species. When the college students see the Gholouies, they don't see  them as disgusting bloodthirsty little creatures; they see them as equals,  and treat them as such.  As it turned out, they could have even learned a  thing or two from the Ghoulies. In one scene that is permantely etched upon  my brain, the Ghoulies, about three or four of them if I remember  correctly, are sitting beside a giant steel fridge stacked with cans and  cans of beer. There is a huge wall of beer in front of them--no less I  imagine than four-hundered cans. And the ghoulies, like model college  students, polish every can off, with relish I might add. Then, when they're  finished the beer, they lie back on the floor, their stomaches swelled out  like watermelons. After this, the Ghoulies sneak into the all-girls  dormitory. And there is a hilariously steamy shower scene which follows  that is truly one of the best moments in cinema.  This movie proves that  the Ghoulies are one of the most adaptable species on earth. Perhaps this  has something to do with their origins in the netherworld. Whatever the  case you can be rest assured that these lovable and vicious critters will  continue to be featured in movies.  At present there are four Ghoulies  movies. And there is no end in sight. At least there shouldn't be. After  all, the possibilities are literally endless: Ghoulies in Space. Ghoulies  on Vacation. Ghoulies go to Vegas. Ad infinitum.  Long live the Ghoulies!",950227200,12,2420,4.79126213592233

7821884,4,6302149630,"Ghoulies 3 is my favorite in the Ghoulies series. It's like Animal House, only with little monsters. Ghoulies 3 is about those little devils causing havoc on a college campus during prank week. If you think that description sounds fun, then you will think the movie is fun. Not only are there some great laughs, but Ghoulies 3 even tosses in some great T & A. I was surprised because I don't remember any of the other Ghoulies movies having any nudity. Ghoulies 3 is included in the 8 pack horror collection just released by Lions Gate. I highly recommend picking it up, because you not only get Ghoulies 3, but several other campy and cheesy horror films from the 80's as well.",1334188800,2,678,4.520325203252033
7821885,4,6302149630,"This sequel was a little bit different from the first two movies. I really liked it though. You've got the rat looking ghoulie, cat ghoulie, and the ghoulie that's green with sharp teeth. The ghoulies in this movie are still evil but in a funny way. John Carl Buechler directed this one (He did the makeup/creature effects for the Ghoulies in parts one and two) The Ghoulies talk in this one and have some funny voices. I love the part when they go on a pantie raid and drink beer. That part had me laughing. Then you've got the hilarious Kevin McCarthy as Professor Ragnar. He's 93 years old now and still acting in movies. Wow that guy is a legend! He's damn good actor too. Anyway this is a fun horror comedy. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the first two Ghoulie movies. It's currently not out on DVD in America, but is available on VHS. You can always order it from another country though and watch it with a region free DVD player. That's what I did. Hopefully Ghoulies III will come out one day in the USA for everyone in the world to see.

I give Ghoulies III a 9/10",1294876800,,1079,4.28921568627451
7821886,4,6302149630,"I enjoyed this movie, too bad its not on dvd yet...If you like 80s style films, then I would recommend this. The music in film is also worth noting, the whole movie is just fun. Its your typical college / teen flick with a group of guys trying to get the girls but throw some Ghoulies into the mix and this is what you have...",1272067200,3,326,4.030769230769231
7821887,1,6302149630,"Me and my friend sat down to watch this movie. We like cheap horror movies and we had just watched Ghoulies 1 & 2, so we thought Ghoulies 3, Ghoulies Go To College would be pretty good. We were terribly wrong. No matter how you look at it, this movie is terrible. In a comedy stand point, or a horror movie stand point. Also, it completly ignored the plots of the past two movies. Plus, the ghoulies talked in this one which was not funny at all. We had high hopes for this movie but it let us down. If your reading this and thinking to yourself, ""Well if this guy hated it so much he must just not like those types of movies, and its probably one of those movies where its so bad its hilarious"". Well, that's not the case. Never watch this movie. Spend the half hour on something worth while like Demons at the Door or The Toxic Avenger, just please, don't put yourself through what me and my friend went through. I leave this review for the well being of others.",1196467200,4,964,4.188172043010753
7821888,5,6302149630,The best part is when the ghoulies kill that hot girl with the plunger in the shower and when she falls on the floor her feet stick up in the air she has good looking feet and legs its a very hott part,1184976000,4,201,3.697674418604651
