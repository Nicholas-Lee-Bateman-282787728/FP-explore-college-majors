3971287,5,B002R1X5AM,"I had been trying to find instructional materials to help me through the process of learning Vegas Movie Studio without much luck. Frustrated by the seeming lack of availability of any instructional materials for this wonderful video editing application, I decided to search on Youtube to see if I could find anything that might be useful to help me learn the program. That's where I found many helpful video tips posted by Bill Meyers; the author and producer of ""101 Tips, Tricks and Techniques for Sony Vegas Movie Studio"". I only wish I had found his video tips before I wasted a LOT of my time sifting through Youtube videos posted by BRAProductions and another Youtube user named Mark Apsolon. These other two youtube users are self absorbed people who are more interested in promoting themselves and increasing their comments and number of views for their youtube videos than in helping their viewers learn something. If you want to waste incredible amounts of your time to ""possibly"" learn a tidbit of something useful here or there, then I suggest you go to Youtube and view videos on Sony Vegas posted by Mark Apsolon. You will watch a 15 to 20 minute video of him talking about his website and his random drawing contest for people who post comments on his videos and maybe he'll actually discuss Sony Movie Studio for 3 or 4 meandering minutes out of a 20 minute video. I think you'll find like I did that watching his videos are a complete waste of your time.

If you value your time like I do and really want to learn useful tips that will quickly get you working in this wonderful video application, then check out some of Bill Meyers Youtube videos on Sony Vegas Movie Studio and then Purchase ""101 Tips and Tricks"". I didn't purchase my copy from Amazon; I purchased it from Bill Meyers website, along with another video, ""Tools of How to Video Production"". Bill Meyers is very knowledgeable about using both Sony Vegas and Movie Studio and is an excellent teacher. His no nonsense approach to sharing his knowledge of these applications is well planned and thought out before he actually films his video clips, so what you get are short and concise video clips that get right to the point. All of his clips focus on demonstrating specific steps in accomplishing a variety of different tasks to aid the viewer in putting together your own video clips to make a complete DVD video production. The DVD is well organized and includes many videos that you won't find on youtube. I was convinced that purchasing his instructional DVD would be a good educational investment after watching some of his video clips on youtube and I was right! If you want to quickly learn valuable tips and information to help you get started in editing your own videos using Vegas Movie Studio, then I highly recommend you purchase this DVD as well as checking out his youtube videos; just search for Bill Meyers, Sony Vegas.",1271376000,38,2918,4.710371819960861

I purchased the software and wanted to understand how to use it without having to search back and forth online. Bill Myers has everything in one place for you to reference as you are working on projects. Just pop his dvd in, fire up Movie Studio and follow along when you want to figure out how to do something. He has everything arranged by category, so you can just refer to what you want to learn how to do and duplicate it on your project. As Bill says ""its easy once you know the secret"". This is a big help since I am brand new to video editing. The amount of content he includes on this one dvd is massive. I recommend investing in this information if you are like me who is new to video editing, doesn't want to waste time online and figuring things out, and wants to shorten the learning curve to start creating more professional projects.

I wasn't getting the kind of help I needed from the vegas software tutorials, so I bought 101 Tips and it is worth every penny (and not too many of those, at that.) Mr. Myers lessons helped me master green screen projects, flying windows, the development of unusual and exciting titles, and many other video enhancements; plus, provided pointers on getting my workspace back to its normal reset after I somehow managed to lose palettes. He doesn't stop with the single lesson, either, as he repeats the steps for each lesson before signing off. I try something new every day. It has made Vegas as easy and accessible as the older software I used to use. It truly is as he says in his sign offs - ""easy if you know the trick.""",1347494400,,773,4.48936170212766

This man offers ONE SINGLE rapid 5 minute lesson per 4 headings. It barely scratches the surface. He doesn't show you ANYTHING about HOW to drop music or text into a clip! He says, ""here's where you can do it,"" but there are few useful tips... there are a couple dealing with setting preferences, but that's it. I am hugely disappointed. Such misrepresentation!

3971297,4,B002R1X5AM,"Just received the DVD and am very impressed. Learned so much in 15 minutes that I knew I had made the right decision. There are a few oddities in the videos though. Like saving your layout. It is supposed to be under the ""View"" menu but it's not there. And even though the ""Help"" files refer to it, there is no option under any menu I've found yet that allows you to save your view. The layout is preserved until you open the program again, but if you had different layouts for different editing scenarios and wanted to save them, I can find no way to do it. I had a problem with Adobe Flash not working and sent Bill an e-mail and he responded very quickly. Turns out that after I had it up and running under Google Chrome, I found that FireFox had an update and as soon as I downloaded the update, I was running the program under FireFox and Chrome with no problems. The help files in the program are easier to understand once you've gone through Bill's videos. What a great resource! The video needs to be reviewed and compared to this version, 11.0, in order to correct some minor mistakes, but nothing that should hinder you in using the DVD. Order this DVD and learn.

3971299,1,B002R1X5AM,"I ordered the 101 tips and tricks for using Sony Vegas Studio version 11 by BMyers BUT I was sent the software for Sony Vegas Studio HD Platinum version 11 instead. I placed a request for a return pickup for UPS on the Amazon website to send the wrong shipment back. I selected a replacement option online also for my original shipment but did not get any confirmation that they were sending it along.

I then called customer service and I asked them if they would see if a replacement was ordered to be sent to me. They said that there was no replacement on the way. So I told them that I would then order my original shipment again and I hungup. Then after a minute, I received a phone call from Amazon telling me that they would order a replacement to be sent out to me ASAP.

I wonder why when I chose the 'replacement' option online that this did not produce another shipment for the original ordered product to be shipped to me?

I am also wondering if UPS was contacted to come pick up the incorrect first shipment? Online it says that UPS will pick it up usually within the first business day but confirmation of when has yet to be determined.

I will update this post when I learn more. I would have rated this experience a no star but it wouldn't let me post my review.

UPDATE:

Here is an update. When no time was given me for UPS pickup for the wrongly sent item, I got antsy and printed out a return label and dropped the return at a UPS dropoff box the next day. The UPS man came to my door two hours later with a label so they were proactive about picking it up.

The replacement product was sent free of charge on the one day delivery option and the correct one arrived today. I got an email today that the returned product was credited to my account so all is forgiven and my story has a happy ending. Nothing and noone in this world is perfect including me so I am still in the fold of believers in Amazon.

Sony Movie Studio worked well, not crashing and similar in layout on the timeline. But ... the unfamiliar terms used in the 'help' section confused me no end and techniques I had used before were not always compatible with the Sony software.  I had seen Mill Myers on the internet and chose his tuition because of the calm way he talks you through the stages.  He leads you in from the very basics, giving confidence to anyone just starting out on movie editing. Watching on screen the sequence needed as he talks you through a technique is so much better than a text book.  If you did something months ago but cannot remember how to do it - replay that section of the disc and you'll be saying, ""Of course!"" as you go back to the timeline and get it sorted.

3971301,5,B002R1X5AM,"I have used Bill Myer's Tricks and Tips for Sony Vegas quite a bit with version 10, so I cannot speak about 11 except that I am sure it can only be better. What I want to speak of is what I see as the integrity of Mr. Myers. He delivers on what he says he will do. He explains things in an easy to understand step by step fashion. I am not computer savvy at all. His screen-casts (video demonstrations) are very precise and clear - easy to understand and follow. As others have said, his videos are short and to the point. I like to open his tutorial on my laptop while I execute his step by step instructions on my desktop. For me that really simplifies and facilitates the learning process. I also have been greatly helped by the abundant and practical information he provides on his website. And what has truly earned him 5 stars with me is that he has helped me through some important questions I had through email, and that quite promptly I must add. I would not abuse the privilege however. You can't go wrong with this DVD. One last tip from me. Organize the tips and tricks that you found useful to you in your own document so that you can easily find it with future use.

3971303,5,B002R1X5AM,"I learned alot about Vegas Movie Studio from watching YouTube videos by ""GuerillaBill"" Myers and TemporalParadox. Thought I'd order Bill's 101 Tips DVD since I felt I already got my moneys worth from his YouTube contributions. Some of the things on the DVD were already on YouTube, but I didn't mind. There were a number of other tips that were not on YouTube. The DVD has things nicely organized and easy to get to. I've gone through the entire DVD twice now and found it help me get up to speed quickly. It even had a place that was excellent for getting fonts. I recommend it to anyone who has just bought Sony Vegas Movie Studio.

As others have indicated it is about version 10, not version 11 ... but there is not that much different between the two versions. Version 11 actually has a bug in it in that if you open the Text and Title generator it almost always blows up when you go to add a shadow. However, there is a legacy Text generator in Version 11 that is the same Text generator from version 10 that Bill shows in his DVD. It's much better and does not blow up when adding shadows. Some of the videos are repetitive (in that they review things that were introduced in an earlier video), but as a beginner I did not mind being reminded. Additionally, that allowed me to jump directly to a topic of interest without worrying that I missed something I needed for the particular topic.

I was also impressed that Bill Myers took the time to write back when I originally asked about the shadow text on the next Text and Title generator causing Vegas Movie Studio to crash.",1325462400,6,1582,4.414383561643835

I first stumbled across Bill Myers in my search for easy to understand tips for Sony Vegas movie studio - I feel extremely happy to have done so because there is NOTHING out there for the novice user.

Bill has an uncanny capacity to breakdown the most complex piece of information into easy bite-size pieces, which make you the viewer feel confident in your abilities to produce an extremely good piece of work using Sony Vegas movie studio.

Each individual section in this DVD is about 3 to 5 min long, clearly explained and doesn't leave the viewer feeling overwhelmed, which for a instructional DVD is very rare these days.

3971308,4,B002R1X5AM,"Bill Myers is well-known in some circles for his expertise in digital editing.  For example, he has his own website, and a channel on Youtube.  Here, Myers puts 101 Tips, Tricks and Techniques on a single DVD for those of us who know pretty much nothing about digital editing.

He is a good teacher.  Each Tip (if I can call these video segments that) is about 1:30 to 5:00 minutes or so.  Most are in the 1-3 minute range.

Sony Movie Studio is not an expensive editing software, as these things go.  The cost for the least expensive version is just a hair over twenty dollars.  The next step up is the Platinium version, which is about four times that cost, but well under a C-note.

As it comes from Sony, Movie Studio is extremely light on instructions.  In fact, there's no printed owner's guide or instruction manual.  There are very limited tutorials that one can follow, from within the program, but it's really just limited and simple information.  Sony leaves the door open to educational efforts such as Myers.  It's a shame, really, that Sony can't include a 40 or so page manual to get you started on Movie Studio, but they don't.

Strongly recommended.  Myers covers most of the basics, and he assumes the user knows very little about the program.  He starts from ground zero, and helps you learn from there.

Why not five stars?  I find the organizational structure to be a little lacking.  There is no logical progression between subjects.  I do know that Myers has a previous DVD called ""Editing How-to Videos with Sony Vegas Movie Studio"" that came out a couple of years prior to the release of this instructional disc.  Perhaps that covers all of the basics.  However, it would have been nicer if the book were laid out a bit more logically.",1313452800,7,1760,4.591639871382637

Lots of great content broken up into small segments. It's very easy to find what you need.
The videos are short, to the point and show you exactly what you need to do to get a particular effect. Bill uses lots of screen shots so you can see everything he is doing very easily.
The material covered is very relevant to what you will actually need to do a real world project. Blur out faces, spotlight faces, slow motion, green screen effect (like you see all the time on tv and in the movies) so you can have very professional looking backgrounds, change from color to B&W, make new video look like older footage, etc...

The DVD covers the basics, telling you what settings to use when you are first starting out. Then, it covers many effects that you will need if you want your videos to look like the pro videos you see on TV all the time.

I am only half way through the videos right now and I can already say I am thoroughly happy with this product. I wanted to learn video editing very quickly. Now, that I have this DVD, I am confident I will be making pro looking videos in no time. I leave this istructional DVD software running in the background. If I forget how to do something, I open this program, point on the topic I need, and I get step by step instructions on how to do what I am trying to do. It encourages you to try new things. Help is only an alt-tab away!

This video is relevant for all of the most recent versions of Vegas.

This video is divided into chapters for easy navigation and includes the promised ""Tips & Tricks"" but also a very useful section on customizing the ""Preferences"" to make the workflow smoother (at least for me).

Each concept is covered with video examples and a walkthrough of the required steps to achieve the result. The videos are mostly short and to the point, but thoroughly cover the concept being shown.

The real value of the DVD is that it even if you don't need a particular ""Trick"", watching all of it will give you an idea of the true power of Vegas and will give you ideas on how to get the most out of it on future projects.

8378305,5,B002R1X5AM,It is a good intro to SONY 11.  Well presented.  I would say the narrator goes a little too fast for some topics.,1388448000,,113,3.869565217391304
8378306,1,B002R1X5AM,"Wouldn't work in the least. I consider that a bust!  It was a waste of valuable time and I had to send it back, but the seller was cool so nothing against them.",1371945600,,160,3.8484848484848486
8378307,4,B002R1X5AM,"When I received this, I noticed that it was actually written for Sony Vegas, and not Sony Platinum.  I contacted the seller before opening the case, to say that I may need to return it if not suitable.  She told me to go ahead and try it out.  She responded very quickly, too.

Anyway, I watched a few of the 'lessons' last night.  The program has a slightly different interface to the later product, but there is only so many things you can do with a NLE program, after all!  I have no problems associating the lessons with the program I have.  You do need to be aware of the issue, though.  As a total newbie to the editing scene - I am still playing with the free trial while I await delivery of my regular copy - the lessons are very helpful.  He explains things thoroughly, but without ""talking down"" to the viewer.  The videos are broken up into a whole bunch of lessons, most of which seem to be 2 or 3 minutes in length.  It was easy to pause the video while I jumped across to my program and tried out what he was explaining.  Apart from one item, everything in mine worked just as his did, and I suspect the one that didn't was user error.  I need to go back and make sure I wasn't doing something wrong somewhere.

The lessons I watched so far would probably be considered really basic by anyone who has a bit more experience with the editing stuff.  I have not watched any of the lessons with the 'tricks' just yet, so  I don't know if they would be a lot more advanced.  The sound and picture quality are both very good.

I would certainly recommend this to anyone starting out, even with the different screen interface between the programs.",1362700800,,1654,4.280645161290322
8378308,5,B002R1X5AM,"I bought this along with the software. You might think it's not worthy since we can find pretty much all videos online, but the organization on DVD and have these collection in your computer is priceless.

The videos are awesome, Mike explains everything in details and he is very good at it (a natural teacher in my opinion).

If you don't wanna waste your time on a trial and error base using Sony Vegas, don't waste another second and buy this.",1361664000,,447,4.506172839506172
