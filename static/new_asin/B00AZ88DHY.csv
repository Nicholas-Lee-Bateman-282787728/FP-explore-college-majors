5528986,5,B00AZ88DHY,"Another great instalment in catechesis from the 'EVANGELIUM' project featuring Frs. Marcus Holden, Andrew Pinsent, Jeremy Davies and Behruz Rafat with EWTN's media personalities Joanna Bogle and Steve Ray, this particular chapter deals with great clarity and depth the existence of the angels, both holy and fallen. A lot of energy has been spent to ensure proper catechesis in this area. Hence it is subdivided into various chapters which are as follows:
1. God - The nature of God, His existence, manifestations and works.
2. Man - The spiritual and corporeal existence of man, the gifts with which he is endowed with, the ultimate goal of man.
3. Angels - Their heirarchy, functions, their nature
4. Demons - Their unmasking revealing their fallen nature, what they really are and what they want us to believe about them, what they hate, their effect on man and mankind etc.
5. New Age - Where can we encounter them? What are the conduits by which they can reach us or rather how do we expose ourselves to them ?
6. Victory - To whom is given the victory, what are the means of gaining spiritual weapons?
Quite a bit is mentioned about exorcism and the increased need for this ritual and the role of priests in this battle.
As usual this 55 minute documentary is visually stunning with a haunting background score.",1361145600,43,1317,4.755458515283843
5528987,5,B00AZ88DHY,The DVD informs the viewer of the different type of angel and greatly needed the different names of types of angels.  Most person read the names of angel and did not realize that the verse is speaking of types of angels.  The DVD also discuses the role of angels something not real thought in protestant Church and Other than Christian Churches(0TC)  It is a greatly need help in teaching the complete work of the LORD.,1391731200,,419,4.56
5528988,5,B00AZ88DHY,"Met my expectations.  Was an easy read and very interesting.  It seems the author was almost defensive regarding the material.  It is hard to accept that a ""spiritual realm"" can affect us in this temporal existence.",1390176000,,215,4.916666666666667
5528989,2,B00AZ88DHY,"Didn't quite get this... maybe I was not paying attention well enough, but it never got my attention. I'll try to watch it again in a few months...",1380067200,2,147,4.285714285714286
5528990,4,B00AZ88DHY,"This was good, however, I was hoping more of St. Thomas Aquinas's theology, e.g., the Summa Theologiae...........Aquinas is considered the ""Doctor of Angel's"" and is one of the foremost, if not the most knowledgable of these mighty messengers.  All of the title:  Powers & Dominions:  Angels, Demons & Spiritual Warfare was way too many very, very deep and extensive subject matters to cover in one little DVD.  It was okay.............but the title doesn't fit the material.  Thanks......Rita L. Rast  P.S. - I NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT MY ANGEL AND I TRY NOT TO DRIVE FASTER THAN MY ANGEL CAN FLY.........:)  :)  :)  LOL!",1379980800,,622,4.961165048543689
5528991,2,B00AZ88DHY,"Strong, Orthodox cast that missed a great opportunity to make an informative, up-to-date documentary on the explosive work of Satan in our world. This DVD is very repetitive  and is very basic. It would perhaps be OK for someone brand new to the faith. Perhaps rather than watching this, one would benefit from a good read like Neal Lozano's ""Unbound"" or Francis MacNutt's ""Deliverance from Evil Spirits""",1376265600,7,404,5.029850746268656
5528992,5,B00AZ88DHY,Still learning this helped me see a different way. I. think watching this helped my reading the book and doing my workbook too.,1375315200,3,127,4.565217391304348
5528993,5,B00AZ88DHY,"I watched this DVD same day it arrived, and it is very good, but I wish it had been longer so it would go deeper.",1369785600,6,113,3.56
5528994,5,B00AZ88DHY,"As a Catholic who is involved in a serious ministry to those afflicted with demonic attachment, as well as aiding those who are coming out of the Occult with serious demonization, I know how vital it is to have a correct understanding of what the Roman Catholic Church teaches on these issues. It is also very important to know Canon Law and the authoritative norms that govern such ministry and practices. This video is an excellent resource for anyone looking to become informed on the basis for the Church's understanding of God's creative order with regards the angels, those angels that rebelled (which we now call demons), Christ's victory on the Cross over that dark kingdom, and how the Church now must apply that victory in our own lives and in service to others. I was particularly delighted to see mandated exorcist Father Jeremy Davies in the video. His comments alone are worth the purchase, but the video is blessed by each one of the other presenters involved. (I will say as a side note that Steve Ray needs to learn his Bible source quotes a bit better. While his comments are excellent, he miss-speaks more than once while referring to verses or places in the Bible. That's a minor issue though.)

The video does not go into Church Canon law and the various authoritative nuances of conducting exorcisms; nor does it explain exorcism as a discipline, such as the difference between a simple and a solemn exorcism. However, that is not the purpose of this particular teaching. This presentation is to lay the theological, philosophical, and scriptural basis of demonology, and presents that from a very solid catechetical basis. It is basic in its scope, but extremely well done. I found this DVD so compelling that I literally sat, watched the video in detail, and typed out the entire transcript so I could have the teachings contained within for my own personal study and reflection. It is that good. I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1369267200,27,1951,4.841317365269461
5528995,5,B00AZ88DHY,"This DVD was suggested to me by a priest and I must say, for it to be in a documentary style it was very well done... you have various priests, a layman and a laywoman discussing the reality of Angels and Demons in a very thorough and easy to understand manner. It also gives great tips and greater understanding for what we deal with in our daily lives of struggling with spiritual warfare. it is very real.",1363737600,17,408,4.311688311688312
5528996,5,B00AZ88DHY,Whether we belief it or not  our life on earth is temporary and this film explained the existance of the Angels and of the fallen angels.,1363046400,21,137,4.269230769230769
