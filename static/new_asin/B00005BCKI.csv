1421826,5,B00005BCKI,"I saw 'Blue Planet' several years ago at the IMAX, and it has remained my favorite.  The surround sound is astounding, and the DVD transfer is excellent; if you have an HD-ready projection TV with progressive-scan DVD player, you'll be amazed at the resolution.  Unlike some other films that display compression artifacts on larger screens (unfortunately, ""The Living Sea"" is one of them), this film looks just as crisp and beautiful as the original IMAX presentation.  It's only 42 minutes in length, but you won't be sorry you picked this one up.",995241600,11,548,4.934782608695652
1421827,5,B00005BCKI,"For people who love the space and their planet this is one ""must-to-have"" DVD. The images from the space are excellent. The sound is great.

I RECOMMEND IT.",994204800,,305,4.464285714285714
1421858,5,B00005BCKI,"If you enjoy learning about the ""Cosmos"" Do not overlook this DVD. It is quite beautiful in 3D. I will buy thiese educational helper as long as they are made. What I may have missed in school, I certainly learned from this DVD. Question: Why do they call it the Blue Planet? Purchase this DVD and you will learn much more then this question.",1425859200,,341,4.34375

1421864,1,B00005BCKI,"Misleading title!  I bought this mistakenly for Blue Planet, Sea of Life.  Although I'm a science/ tech lover, this Blue Ray was extremely boring and I couldn't help but feel like I got con'd by a misleading name",1397606400,,212,4.552631578947368

1421891,4,B00005BCKI,I remember seeing this film at the Air and Space mueseum in DC when I was a senior in high school. It was one of many highlights of a week long trip from My home in Iowa that my senior class took in 1992. I have been looking for a copy ever since it made that big of an impact on me. My advice is for parents to snatch a copy up for their children to watch,1314662400,,356,3.6363636363636362
1421892,5,B00005BCKI,This blu-ray is absolutely phenomenal. The imagery is stunning and the launches of the space shuttle are amazing. This is one of the best documentaries ever recorded. The Dolby True-HD encoded soundtrack will allow you to experience a launch like never before. I highly recommend this title to any and all.,1299456000,,306,5.019607843137255
1421893,4,B00005BCKI,"This is a must own.  It is also nice as a background video when you have company.  It opens up ones mind to the wonders of Gods creation and Mans destruction by depleting natural resources. A movie well made and drives home a point well worth it! It a very beautiful movie, giving us a perspective of how wonderful Mother Earth is! Photography and narration is great. The team has done a great job, relating the analogy of an Astronaut to a space shuttle as Man to earth.",1277251200,,471,4.340909090909091
1421894,1,B00005BCKI,"Entirely too much political agenda behind this movie with all of the statements regarding evolution, global warming, and other environmentally driven and unproven hypothesis that folks want to pass off as scientifically proven facts.  There are some good views of earth from space but there is entirely too much dialogue about the damage that man is causing earth and there is entirely too much one-sided viewpoints presented in this.  Do not waste your time and money.",1276473600,4,469,5.157894736842105
1421895,2,B00005BCKI,"The Title is much bigger and more attractive than the content. The film is too slow, narration is too boring, most of the shots are taken from space shuttles.
It is much below the expected for a blue ray production.",1268265600,2,215,4.4
1421896,5,B00005BCKI,"Dream is Alive has Amazing space shuttle launch footage and incredible shots of earth from space. The Imax cameras give you the feeling of being in the space shuttle with the crew.

1421897,5,B00005BCKI,"If you got an old HD-DVD player, this is one DVD you have to have in your collection. The Planet Earth HD-DVD to complement it is also a must.",1263600000,2,142,3.9310344827586206
1421898,3,B00005BCKI,"I recently purchased a Blu-ray player and was looking for new Blu-Ray Disks to play in it.  As expected the video for this disk is beautiful, however as I listened to the dialog I felt it was preaching ""enviromentally correctness"" and was rather condecending to people who inhabit the earth.  Eventually I turned off the sound and put some music on and was able to enjoy the great video shots in the video.",1261526400,2,406,4.5479452054794525
1421899,3,B00005BCKI,"This DVD has some nice shots from space, which does make it different from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray</a>]. I particularly liked seeing the straight of Gibraltar, in between Spain and North Africa, and actually seeing each continent separately. Florida also looks good from space. However, the ""Blue Planet"" documentary is extremely short - only 42 minutes. Some of that is not even used well (such as a scene of tourists watching a space shuttle launch).

Using footage from space is a great idea and I hope more documentaries  incorporate such footage. However, when there are so many other amazing blu-ray alternatives out there, I just feel like you don't get a whole lot of bang for your buck with this disc.",1249689600,,1198,6.933774834437086
1421900,2,B00005BCKI,I got the HD dvd Blue Planet.  We have a Sony large screen HD TV and a Sony HD DVD player.  Sorry-this DVD does not work on our equipment.  The TV and player are 3 years old. I bought this disc on Amazon about a year ago but just now tried to play it.  The darn thing should play but a disclaimer in the disc jacket states that some players may need to have software or firmware upgraded to work. The player's LCD window states that the disc can neither be played or written to. I checked on Sony's customer support and there are no updates for this player- RDRGX315 sony HD DVD reader/player.  So beware.  Be sure your player will play this type of disc or has capability to be updated. I am disgusted with the whole DVD scene.,1249430400,,728,4.164285714285715
1421901,3,B00005BCKI,"I wish to add my vote of a two or three star rating for this IMAX product. It just didn't do it for me and might be pleasant to play in the background some time you feel like dozing or could use some sleep.

Largely a sequence of scenes looking straight down on cloud formations from space, interrupted by brief scenes filmed from the corresponding location at ground level.  There were only a few nice image sequences and I've become a little jaded and spoiled over the years by other IMAX productions.

IMAX has made much better space specials before featuring footage from the shuttle in orbit. I usually grade on the curve for space materials but this was pretty mediocre compared to other IMAX films.",1247788800,,705,4.579365079365079
1421902,3,B00005BCKI,"This is the movie made specifically for IMAX 10 years before the Blue Planet television show came out. To all the people saying how awful it is compared to Planet Earth; This movie has nothing to do with the Planet Earth show, and should not be compared.

1421907,3,B00005BCKI,"This review is NOT for this film, but to serve as a warning to potential buyers.  It is apparent that many people, like myself, bought this 44 minute IMAX film  believing it is the excellent 8 episode BBC production ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" from the creators of ""Planet Earth"".  This is NOT the case. ""Blue Planet"" and ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" are two totally separate productions.  Unfortunately, ""The Blue Planet: Seas of Life"" has not been released on Blu-Ray yet.",1233187200,8,481,4.690476190476191
1421918,4,B00005BCKI,"Depending on what type of equipment you have to display a large film in IMAX is what really matters when it comes right down to it.  In the case of having a projector that fills a screen of 106 inches, I begin to wonder why aren't all films made with IMAX in mind - it's that good!.",1232323200,,282,3.9473684210526314
1421919,5,B00005BCKI,For anyone that was left with a HD DVD player this is one thing you want to get before it sells out.  Breathtaking video in the best available quality!,1232236800,,151,4.206896551724138
1421920,4,B00005BCKI,This documentary was fascinating.  I really learned a lot and even my kids enjoyed it.  It wasn't as dull as some documentaries tend to be.,1232150400,,139,4.52
1421921,2,B00005BCKI,"My husband got this for Christmas from a family member, and while excited at first to see images, I was put out by the toneless narrator, and felt like it was an elementary/junior high science class. Some of the images were stunning, but like what other people were saying I saw some dirt on the picture for the blu-ray release. Not as high quality as I was expecting, really. I think we would have rather received the Planet Earth series, starting with the ocean one. That may have been more interesting. I am still scratching my head why this was considered a Christmas gift choice since neither my husband or I watch documentaries except on Discovery or History Channel, and we already get those in HD. I say skip it.",1230595200,,720,4.546153846153846
1421922,5,B00005BCKI,"Very good show, great IMAX like experience on a 73"" Mitsu HDTV, looooove that Blu-Ray!",1222473600,,86,4.8
1421923,2,B00005BCKI,"I bought this walking through the airport, expecting it to be one of the collection of BBC programmes.  Got back to my home country, popped it in, and was very dissapointed.  Quality did not seem to be up to blu-ray standard of picture quality.

My own fault, I believe I mistook this product for ""The Blue Planet - Seas of Life"", which I have not seen thus far, but I believe is up to the standard of the BBC programmes.  In comparison to the BBC line of Blu-rays available, this Blue Planet pales in comparison (not 100% certain that this is not part of the BBC line, but just by comparison of the quality, it definitely does not seem to be).

For really stunning visuals, great narration, entertaining and suitable soundtrack, and an enjoyable, engrossing learning experience, get Planet Earth, and the remaining BBC line - Galapogos, Wild China, Ganges.",1222128000,,857,4.6866666666666665

I lost interest and had a hard time following some of the shots they were talking about from space. It's ok, informational but if you want to get something REALLY good - get Planet Earth!",1216252800,,343,4.375

1421927,2,B00005BCKI,"I purchased this as one of the my first HD DVDs.  The videography is wonderful, but this production seemed more like an infomercial for NASA and not something I'd watch more than once.

Probably not a fair comparison, but after buying the Planet Earth set, I have no desire to look at this DVD again.",1207612800,2,300,4.4363636363636365

1421942,5,B00005BCKI,"I bought the Blue-ray disc just for the 2nd feature on the disc: ""The Dream is Alive"". I (still) have the ""original"" release on Laserdisc and this Blue-ray disc is finally replacing it. Yes - it is dated (1985) but was has really changed with the shuttle? The launches are still gripping including the night one. Amazing images and now in theater quality on my 52-inch.

1421945,2,B00005BCKI,I was disappointed in this product.  It was not what I expected.  I was hoping it was the same (Blue Planet) program that is available on DVD.,1202169600,,142,4.222222222222222
1421946,2,B00005BCKI,"The Blue Planet is a beautiful viewing but not worth the money for only 40 min of film. It is good enough for repeat watch. Max price should of been about $15.00.
The second film, A Dream is Alive, was made in 1985 and is way outdated. This was a year before the Challenger explosion. Not worth watching.",1198800000,2,304,4.258620689655173
1421947,2,B00005BCKI,"I purchased this on Blu-ray earlier today and watched it with my dad tonight expecting it to be something like the wonderful Planet Earth series, but with NASA. But let's face it. It's not. I have to agree with the others here that say the HD quality could be, well, better. And since it was made in 1990 I *kind of* understand that. Besides, that's not even my complaint so I won't delve into the picture quality aspect at all. My biggest problem came at the half-way point when the documentary took a 'left' turn and became nothing more than a tree--hugger/bleeding-heart piece on how Man is destroying the planet. I mean it was just ""Ozone layer this""... and ""Rain forest that""... and ""Man is making extinct hundreds of undiscovered species every minute"". They literally said that; ""Undiscovered"". Ok, if they're undiscovered then how do we know we're causing they're extinction?

  Listen, I'm not the kind of guy that would throw his Big Mac wrapper out the window of his Hummer while driving through a nature preserve but... Come on! Do these people really think they need to dupe Americans in to buying their liberal B.S. by marketing it as ""A spectacular look at Earth like you've never seen before""?! I am sure that some people will/do love this documentary for everything it stands for. But if you're like me and you don't want to be preached at by someone who feels that the best thing you can do for Mother Earth is to kill yourself... then don't bother. Somehow, I'm getting my money back!",1198108800,6,1502,4.660377358490566
1421948,4,B00005BCKI,"The reviews on this site were not particularly encouraging, but for this price not much to loose. Yes, it's obvious that this was converted from an old analog film; you can view some of old film particles but they are not annoying at all, and they rather give you more of human touch which is hardly felt in digitally mastered 'spiderman 3'. The narration also gives you somewhat analog feeling, but far from a turn-off.  Rather a short running time as most IMAX titles have a bit over half an hour running.  Feels like an appetizer, or a prelude; but then again not to heavy, and lots of amazing pictures you can see. The pixels might not be presented as sharply as in 'planet earth', but they did a good conversion job from an analog film.  Undoubtedly superior picture quality compared to ordinary standard definition DVD titles. No region code, I appreciated that.",1196899200,,868,4.660130718954249
1421949,1,B00005BCKI,"I bought this together with Planet Earth  (PE). I watched PE first which set my expectations for the Blue Planet (BP).  I was extremely disappointed. The narrator was extremely monotonous, and did nothing to really add to the experience. The viusals were good, but the stories were disjointed and brief. I expected more. The duration of the film was also very short. I really expected to see a full length video documentary on the oceans, seas, and lakes. PE has sections that cover oceans and seas and that rendition is so much better than Blue Planet. I can see why now it is sold with Planet Earth as by itself it would be a flop. Great pictures though.",1196726400,6,656,4.5508474576271185

Speaking for myself, I am getting too old to become an astronaut hence will never have the opportunity to view Planet Earth from Space. Watching this Blu-ray disk, made it possible for me to to do just that - see our planet. The clarity, the images etc., were virtually like being in space and watching Earth go by.

A Great Documentary with terrific footage.",1193184000,2,529,6.436619718309859
1421991,3,B00005BCKI,"Amazing play back. Amazing scenes and worth every penny. I have found myself more interested in films / documentaries such as these as I sway away from garbage series TV. This is a great watch for not only adults, but the kids as well and definitely worth a purchase for the family. The IMAX aspect of the film isn't even needed and the colors cannot be beat. If you love this, definitely check out the Planet Earth collection.

The reason for my rating is that this is not a watch for people not interested in documentary style films.",1190764800,,535,4.459183673469388
1421992,5,B00005BCKI,"If you like space history, especially the Space Shuttle period, this is a great DVD to own.

The disc contains two documentaries.  The Dream is Alive is a very early documentary and has very nice shuttle launches, as well as the release of three satellites in space, and views of the VAB and launch pads.  The Blue Planet documentary has a lot of shots of the Earth from space, nature shots, and also shuttle launches.

The image quality is very good, but does not match recent movies like BBC's Planet Earth in HD (which has no space shuttle shots).  I am not aware of any other HD space documentary that matches Blue Planet/The Dream is Alive.  This disc is a must have for HD fans who are also space buffs.",1190678400,3,709,4.415384615384616

Is out of order as well, do not even compare to planet earth not comparison at all, only thing this worth to rent for is to see space shuttle launch in full details and some nice picture shot by satellite in our planet.  Most of the scene is really not good, and is lacking information.",1189900800,7,380,4.121621621621622
1421994,4,B00005BCKI,"Filmed in IMAX by NASA astronauts 200 miles above planet earth, this 41-minute film introduces you to volcanoes and earthquakes, underwater lava chimneys and Amazon rain forests. The narration begins with an earth rise as viewed from the moon, and in a later shot we observe from space a thin blue line, above which is uninhabitable black space and below which is our cocoon-like layer of thin air that is our atmosphere. If there is a theme that integrates these remarkable images it is the delicate balance between earth, air, and water, and, especially poignant, the impact that humanity has had on our tiny blue planet. This film will seem outdated with the new Planet Earth series produced by the BBC in 2006 and shown on the Discovery Channel, but it's still well worth watching and would make for a great evening of family fun.",1189728000,,834,4.758620689655173
1421995,4,B00005BCKI,"This is a very good Blu-Ray transfer and has beautiful images and commentary of the kind you'd expect from the title. At 40 or so minutes it is rather short, but the accompanying feature is also worth having, though not as good.",1188777600,2,228,4.4523809523809526
1421996,5,B00005BCKI,"I can't believe the negative reviews for these are beautiful transfers of beautiful films. Some scenes look far deeper and sharper than the often mentioned PLANET EARTH series which is beautifully made though ""only"" on HD-Video. These films were filmed in space and explore the earth and Space Shuttle, PLANET EARTH is animals/nature with some computer-generated earth views!

The films presented here were made for specially made theatres with screens up to 1.000 square meters big and filmed in 70mm/15perforation, a three times larger film format than 70mm/5perf LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. All films in this format were 30 to 55 minutes long.

I always LOVED the slower pace resulting from these big images, just to get the time to take it all in. Also the earth views are so beautiful they need a slower pace. That is too much for some viewers it seems.

THE DREAM IS ALIVE (1985), 37min, features three space shuttle starts from different angles and shows training of astronauts as well as some of the first footage of the earth actually taken in orbit with the highest definition cameras on earth in the 15/70 format. Sure, there are always scenes in the shuttle where they had a lowlight situation and the image is not as sharp as others. One has to take into account the conditions under which these films were made. What counts is the overall impression and that is definitely high definition. Narrated by Walter Cronkite.
I use this disc to impress my friends and NOT my PLANET EARTH disc ;-) Both films have breathtaking sound (Dolby TrueHD + Dolby Digital + French Dolby Digital). Subtitles French + Espanol.

BLUE PLANET (1990), 44min, to me is a true IMAX classic. Stunning earth views and exploration of the ozone hole at a time when few were talking about it make it one of the most stunning and at the same time serious large format films. Aftermath of San Francisco earthquake and hurricanes in the southeast.

I hope there will be many more IMAX films coming to Blu-ray!",1188691200,11,1982,4.783625730994152
1421997,2,B00005BCKI,"Blue Planet, by its packaging and subject matter, calls for a comparison with  the vastly superior Planet Earth series. This is a little unfair considering the latter is made of recent HD material thoughtfully organized and tied together with a catchy narrative throughout several episodes. By comparison, Blue Planet -and The Dream is Alive- are older material and in many ways dated (the near-future promise of microgravity for the pharmaceutical industry was a 1980s pipe dream, not a 2007 reality just yet...).

However, one could have hoped for a nice video transfer to Blu-Ray. Dated information notwithstanding, the images still have the same inherent beauty. And since the shows were made for IMAX, one believes there should be a way to make them look good.

Unfortunately, they do not. The image quality of Blue Planet (Imax) is uneven, seemingly coming from materials of different original quality (and I exclude the Moon Landing footage). At its best, it only vaguely reminds you of the stunning (and consistent) precision of Planet Earth footage. Most of the time, it seems inferior to the quality of a good, regular DVD on an up-converting player.

Since not enough work has gone into optimizing the image quality of the program -and its companion piece The Dream is Alive- one is left with an obvious realization of what it is primarily: a cheerleading piece for the space program serving mostly NASA's and Lockheed Martin's image building but rather short on content.

Buy Planet Earth in confidence. Almost any audience should be delighted and stunned by its beauty. As for Blue Planet, it should be reserved to the most dedicated -and forgiving- fans of the space program...",1188000000,3,1691,5.046594982078853
1421998,3,B00005BCKI,"I was a little disappointed in the Movie.  Some of the shots were pretty good, but some weren't that good.  It looked like very little of the Movie was shot with HD Cameras.  I think there was way too many shots from outer space onto the Earth.  When they overdo something like that, it tends to make you start to lose interest.  This movie is nothing like Planet Earth and if you've seen that, you'll be kind of spoiled.  If I knew what I know now, I probably would not have bought this movie right away.  Maybe later to add to the collection, because in order to have a collection, you have to have some mediocre Movies also.",1187827200,,627,4.262711864406779
1422009,4,B00005BCKI,"Disk one ""IMAX Blue Planet"" is a great diversion, the story and commentary on disk one are somewhat boring I will admit, the visuals are sharp and clean as all BD releases are.

This is a two disk release, disk two has the IMAX film ""The Dream is Alive"" narrated by Walter Cronkite, I think this is the better of the two films, and I love the sound of Walter's voice as a commentator.

I had watched the second movie at the Kennedy Space Center on their IMAX screen when I was there a couple of years ago, I loved it then, but IMAX is difficult to watch; the screen is so big that at least my eyes cannot take in the whole screen at one time, forcing me to concentrate on one area at a time and missing other elements occurring on screen.

I truly enjoyed watching this on a HDTV, the Blu-ray quality makes it a high def delight, and both disks boast Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sound which made for great sound from both disks.

Neither are ""feature presentations"" as disk one is only 44 minutes, disk two is 37 minutes, but together they make a great diversion and are highly recommended.

  Comparing this offering to the Planet Earth series is like comparing apples and oranges.  Planet Earth is incredible, but it also costs (MSRP) of $100.00.  I know this is not a Planet Earth review, but many have tried to compare this to it.  I recommend that you get both of them, as I have.

If you love this genre, you will love these two movies.  And if you're like me and love the commentary of Walter Cronkite, you will definitely love the second disk in the set.",1187481600,2,1551,4.292096219931271
1422010,1,B00005BCKI,"Very poor quality video.  Definitely not of a Blu-Ray quality and borderline for a DVD.  May look good on a small screen, but almost unwatchable on a 56"" HDTV.

Was so unenjoyable I had to force myself to watch it to completion.

Get Planet Earth instead.",1186617600,20,255,4.478260869565218
1422011,2,B00005BCKI,"This HD DVD disc has two features on it and both are around 50 minutes long.  There's really nothing in the way of extras other then the features.  Both features are neat at first but how much footage of the earth from space can you watch?  That's up to you.  Seeing the earth from orbit these days is nothing new.  I was extremely disappointed that it all ""seemed"" to be shot in film.  I think they have to do this for IMAX but can't they shoot it in pure hi-def video & transfer it to film for the IMAX?  Probably the wrong screen ratios.  A good portion of the film ""jumps"" a lot and it's noticable at 56"".  They made no attempt to clean the film as there's specs of duct & stuff throughout the features.  A lot of the NASA footage is old because everyone is dressed from the early 90's/late 80's.  The space shuttle scenes & Earth scenes from space are fine but not as good as Planet Earth's footage and the video essentials hi-def display of the shuttle taking off blow's this disc away.

The surround sound is actually nice here and there.  A hurricane segment was really convincing in sound eventhough you're watching old raw footage from ""back in the day"".  Overall, you get a total of under 2 hours of lame ""been there, done that"" footage.  They even have a little rant on saving the planet at the last 10 minutes of Blue Planet with the usual citing of devastating facts but no explanation of the proof.  I believe there's a hole in the ozone layer but at least show us some cool satelite/composite shots of it.  I don't know why they give you this great display of our planet that makes you proud to be on this great rock in space for 40 minutes and then end it with a ""stop polluting your planet idiots"", kind of an ending.  Eesh.  I wish they showed more of the craters on earth.  Now that was interesting.

Overall, from an HD DVD point of view...I did not see it in IMAX and thought it would look amazing in HD but I was sadly disappointed.  Thank god I rented it.  And for the blu-ray folks, it isn't going to be much better because the stock is not fantastic.  You get a VC-1 compressed version of older junky film mixed with newer fine looking film.",1186444800,14,2167,4.280788177339901
1422012,2,B00005BCKI,"Move on to ""Planet Earth"" for everything this bluray isn't...

I normally refrain from posting negative reviews in case it's a question of taste and I may be in conflict with other people in that respect.

However in this case I am pretty sure this is a title to avoid for everybody. Especially when there is such an alternative as Planet Earth which presents a hundred times the content and imagery this IMAX adaptation strives to deliver.. and fails..

First of all, this is a very lousy transfer. They didn't bother remastering the 40 minute footage and the ""dirt"" of the master is visible in every frame. It wouldn't have taken a large team to edit them out. Frankly it's the most disappointing bluray transfer I've seen out of the 40 or more bluray titles I have.

Secondly, the narration, disjointed topics, duration of many of the space imagery which drag on for minutes without any movement contribute to a mindnumbingly boring viewing experience. You'll notice you'll be hardpressed not to forward to the next scene every other minute (and let's admit it, there are not that many to start with)

There's also an older similar bonus segment in the bluray, with even worse visuals and mostly resembling SD instead of HD in many places..

In short, I'd strongly suggest you skip this bluray in favor of the stunning Planet Earth if you've not grabbed it yet.",1186272000,199,1364,4.734177215189874

1422015,2,B00005BCKI,"This is a disappointingly boring and formulaic show.  Basically we get hit over the head with how miserable we are making the earth.  All right, already.  Tell me thirty six more times.

Whenever I hear the word ""evolved"" in a show about life on earth it annoys me.  It is the new religion, the new dogma.  It is just as dogmatic as its religious competition preaching Jehovah or Allah or some other fictional character.  Why can't the evolution people just realize that someone very brilliant designed the tiger and the peach, and stop pretending that they just grew out of the soil, like a can of tomato sauce growing out of the dusty rocks on the moon.

The announcer is annoying as hell.  She pronounces every word perfectly and bloodlessly.  She speaks acceptably and ""beautifully"", so beautifully that it is ugly.  Her speech is acceptable, yours is not.  It's a bunch of bull.  I took speech classes too, and I had the sense to ignore them.  They get in the way of honest communication.

The environmentalists feel that they need to bang us over the head every chance they get, telling us how humanity is ruining the planet, and you can sympathize because our government doesn't give a damn about pollution, and in fact revels in it, since it means that their rich campaign contributors will save money by not having to clean up after themselves, making the campaign contributions excellent investments, paying huge profits.  It does pay to own the U.S. government, so they let you do whatever you want.  One hand washes the other.

Sometimes they showed us images of green or blue or white swirls, and they told us it was the Himalayas or Sri Lanka or something, and they really needed to use arrows to show us what they were referring to.  All I saw was a bunch of colored swirls.  Why couldn't they just use an arrow to point out where to look?

Imax should have thrown propriety and predictability and preachiness away and given us an interesting show.  But they weren't creative enough to do that.  So they gave us the same old stuff, preaching the same old new religion, and spoken the way they were taught to speak, artificially.",1152748800,5,2143,4.64095744680851

Photography and narration is great. The team has done a great job, relating the analogy of an Astronaut to a space shuttle as Man to earth.

It opens up ones mind to the wonders of Gods creation and Mans destruction by depleting natural resources. A movie well made and drives home a point well worth it!",1130284800,3,390,4.47887323943662
1422017,3,B00005BCKI,"OK...to start off with the positive, this DVD does have great sound and crisp, vibrant video footage.  Also within the 40 minutes of this DVD, you will come away with a good understanding of the big picture of our planet and how our planet's atmosphere, oceans, land, life and and pollution are all interrelated.  It is also explained in a way that makes it easy to understand.  If you are an adult with with a true interest in Earth science then you can add a star or two to my rating.

I do not recommend this DVD for children.  It will be a real sleeper for them!  The very calming voice of the narrator and fairy tale type of music in the background will put almost any adolescent to sleep.  I say this because I am a high school science teacher and have shown this to my students.  While doing so I have had to nudge my students or get their attention to stay awake.  Those that were awake had that glazed over look in their eyes.  There are better videos out there for students that are more exciting and just as informative.",1129075200,13,1031,4.295336787564767
1422028,2,B00005BCKI,"Astronomy has always been one of my favorite subjects, so I was extremely excited to get this DVD.  Unfortunately in my humble opinion, the movie was lacking in many areas.

THE GOOD

Incredible views - With NASA as partner in the film, IMAX had some incredible shots of the earth.  It was amazing to see this ""outside"" view of the earth.  I was just amazed to see everything we've ever known in our lives presented in one big round package.

THE BAD

Unfortunately I couldn't come up with many good points about this movie.  I honestly was searching for reasons to like this film, but it just fell short in so many areas.

Confusing Views - As I mentioned in the good points, there were some amazing views of the earth provided from the shuttle.  Unfortunately it was difficult to figure out exactly what you were looking at.  It was difficult to discern what you were looking at and most times when a new image flashed on the screen my girlfriend and I were saying something like ""that's florida?!....do you see florida??...i don't see florida!!""

In my opinion the film should have briefly highlighted what you were supposed to be looking at.  Angles are a lot different in space #1 and #2 there was a lot of cloud cover in many of the images.  Maybe ""highlighting"" technology wasn't available in 1990, but I doubt it :)

Narration - The narration appeared to be aimed at elementary school level.  Perhaps that was the intent of the movie, but in my humble opinion the speed at which the film progressed would have bored a younger child to tears.  It was too ""elementary"" in my opinion and I felt ""under stimulated"" through most of the movie.  The narrator also spoke in a boring monotone voice.

Faultline Animation - Oh my goodness.  What a waste of five minutes this part of the film is.  Someone decided to create an animation of basically as if you were flying over the San Andreas faultline.  Given this movie was made in 1990 when computer technology was in it's infant phase compared to today, but I doubt I would have been impressed in 1990 either.  If you've seen this movie already, I'm sure you feel my pain.  They also dub in these roaring plane engine sounds to make it feel like you're zooming over the terrain and it's just ""bad"".  B A D.

Conclusion

Believe me, I was looking for reasons to like this film, but I just didn't think it was very well done.  If you're just dying to add another earth / astronomy film to your collection, then by all means go ahead and buy it.  As I mentioned some of the views are truly breathtaking.  But if you consider the value of the film vs. what you pay I'd have to say this is unfortunately a bad investment.  Knowing what I know now, I honestly would not pay more than $9.95 for this movie.  Sorry, but that's just my humble opinon.  :)

The space and aerial photography are beautiful. Spectacular is the view of a lightning storm as seen from space. Footage of a hurricane, however, did not appear threatening. Sheet metal flying off a small house's roof, a man leaning into the wind.
Things I expected to see but didn't: a storm at sea, a twister, a nice volcano eruption, a geyser, a large crowd of people. The only people we see are two cosmonauts in orbit taking pictures, and some guys cutting trees.
The narration is rather primitive, sometimes mind-numbingly so, as in the end, where the voice-over enumerates those to whom earth is home: ""Earth is home to Jews and Arabs; It is home to Russians and the Chinese; It is home to Germans and Italians"", and so on and on, until (surprise!) ""It is home to ALL of us"".
Some educational facts are given about how many tons of pollutants we emit and millions of acres of forest we destroy each year. These sound horrifying, but to make sense, they need to be put into perspective (there are billions of bacteria in my mouth, but that doesn't mean I'm about to die). How much forest do natural fires destroy each year? How many acres of forest naturally grow back? How much deadly pollution does an average active volcano emit?

IMAX BLUE PLANET reveals the earth to us as only a few people have ever seen it: from space. Orbiting 200 miles above Earths surface, we see how natural forces, like Volcanoes, Earthquakes and Hurricanes, affect our world, and how a powerful new force  humankind  has begun to alter the face of the Earth. From the Amazon rain forests to Serengeti grasslands, inspires a new appreciation of life on Earth, our only home. A presentation of The Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum and Lockheed Martin Corporation of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and was filmed in the IMAX format and exhibited in IMAX theatres worldwide. This Blu-ray disc is digitally mastered from original 70MM film elements with the sound components specially mixed and mastered to produce the highest quality Dolby Surround soundtrack. Narrated by Toni Myers.

BONUS MOVIE: IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE takes you into space alongside the astronauts on the space shuttle and share with them the delights of zero gravity, eating and sleeping in orbit around Planet Earth. Float as never before over the towering Andes, the boot of Italy, Egypt and the Nile, witness a tension filled satellite capture and repair, and the historic space walk by an American woman. IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE was originally filmed in the IMAX format and exhibited in IMAX theatres worldwide. This video version has been digitally mastered from original 70mm elements with the sound components specially mixed and mastered to produce the highest quality 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround soundtracks. IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE takes you into space alongside the astronauts on the space shuttle. Narrated by Walter Cronkite.

FILM FACT: IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE: The 70 mm film was produced and shot 15 to 18 months before the Challenger disaster, and includes appearances by two astronauts who died in the accident; Francis Scobee and Judith Resnik. Challenger itself is featured prominently in the film. Many of the themes and tone of the documentary regarded the normalization of travel to space using the shuttle while giving only passing mention to the dangers. The Challenger disaster would dramatically curtail this belief and subsequent experience would show that the shuttle would not make space travel more accessible or affordable.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Here we have a presentation from the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum and Lockheed Corporation in Association with The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Up first is the IMAX BLUE PLANET [1990] that features dazzling views from space as well as noteworthy sights on the Earth's surface. IMAX BLUE PLANET tackles a tremendous range of material and many topics that are covered, with information from the atmosphere of neighbouring planets to footage of San Francisco's Bay Bridge after the 1989 earthquake to sea creatures living amidst volcanic activity deep in the Gulf of Aqaba, the IMAX  BLUE PLANET documentary turns its attention to the condemnation of human activity toward the end and mans destruction of the environment, especially in the Amazon rain forest.

Imagine being a visitor from another planet and your approach to Planet Earth would be totally breath-taking in its scope as the small fuzzy blue dot becomes a wonderful blue-green and white sphere where obvious weather activity is taking place, but on closer inspection, there seems to be spectacular changes taking place right before your eyes. On several Shuttle missions, Earth has been portrayed from places that nobody else could reach. We also get shown the different locations and the environmental problems mankind has created and at the same time destroying because of their wish to exploit our planets resources for our own selfish benefit.

That weather activity is changing the landscape while unseen seismic activity is also causing spectacular change that can be seen with surface volcanoes violently spewing forth, roiling the oceans and changing flatland into mountaintop. Earths dynamic changes, seen from space, are what drive this beautiful looking 1080p HD Blu-ray release. While the narration by Toni Myers is a little stiff and not as interesting as the image, but the image of Earth against the inky-blackness of space is what makes this IMAX  BLUE PLANET film worth owning on this stunning Blu-ray disc.

Ben Burtt was sound designer on IMAX films IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE, which is of course is the bonus extra on this Blu-ray disc, which was directed by Graeme Ferguson and written by Toni Myers who returns as the screenwriter for the IMAX BLUE PLANET film with Graeme Ferguson now producing and Ben Burtt directing the spectacular show. Fans of the STAR WARS Sci-Fi franchise film series may remember Ben Burtt as the dual-trilogys sound designer and eventual sound/film editor, having come up with it from scratch, all the sounds needed to populate George Lucass imaginary galaxy.

Now, in the truly soundless environment of space, Ben Burtt was able to supervise the filming of Earth footage, which was actually shot over five space shuttle missions by the astronauts themselves, as well as amazing looking ocean and land-based footage of our home planet. This theatrical IMAX film, though offering a stupendous and huge image in special large-format IMAX cinemas, suffered from a short running time of 42 minutes and most IMAX films are usually under 50 minutes and the narration is unfortunately a bit too-mellow, hardly enlightening the viewer any more than the standard  documentary and especially compared to the recent BBC TV series of the Planet Earth releases, and sadly the IMAX film unfortunately falls short of the mark set by that BBC documentary landmark work, still the spectacular views we view make up for any short fall in the audio commentary department.

IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE [1985] is essentially a promotional film for The Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum and Lockheed Martin Corporation of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this special IMAX feature is shorter and more focused than IMAX BLUE PLANET. With additional high resolution shots of Earth from the space shuttle, and interesting footage of astronauts and NASA workers in action, it will be a key purchase only for fans of space exploration. Walter Cronkite's narration is a nice touch that harkens back to the golden age of the America's space program.

IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE covers the early days of NASAs space shuttle development and missions. Of interest for space-travel and NASA buffs, the film spends quite a bit of time on the space shuttle Challenger, which would be destroyed on launch within a year of this films release and sadly some of that doomed missions crew are featured in this IMAX film. Narrated by the wonderful American broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite, this documentary takes viewers on an exciting journey around the Earth as it chronicles mankind's accomplishments in the realm of space exploration. The program highlights the space shuttle, from its design and construction to life on-board the craft. It also presents a behind-the-scenes picture of the astronauts' daily activities and the rigorous training they undergo before travelling to the Space Shuttle. Now considered an IMAX classic, THE DREAM IS ALIVE gives the viewer an unprecedented window on board the space shuttle. Shot by 14 NASA astronauts on three shuttle missions in 1984, the film includes footage of launches and landings, satellite capture and repairs; space walks and an inside look at how the astronauts live in space. Experience the sensation of weightlessness and the splendour of Earth from 250 miles up. Seen by more than 40 million people in 19 countries, THE DREAM IS ALIVE is the next best thing to being actually there.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The release of IMAX BLUE PLANET + IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE on this Blu-ray release from Warner Home Video, has been presented with a stunning 1080p remastered transfer image and the 1.78:1 aspect ratio gives it a image is simply excellent with very little to complain about here and the remastered image from a formerly large-format IMAX film stands up pretty well to avid IMAX videophile enthusiasts or devotee of video recordings or video technology scrutiny, and is a splendid experience to watch. With the IMAX BLUE PLANET the image quality gives some very stunning and brilliant darkest blues, rich reds and subtle warmer colours. With the IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE film the photography is totally awesome, very sharp and beautifully clear. But being in the IMAX format, it is allowed the space and time to reveal its total grandeur, scope and scale, whilst educating us on the issues relating to the subject at hand, and especially with this now serving as a time capsule on the views surrounding when the Space Shuttle was fully in operation, which is now confined to history.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video presents us with a stunning 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround audio experience, and being in outer space it is out-of-this-world especially with both IMAX BLUE PLANET + IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE films. The film IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE at the start is brilliant as you get some really stunning dynamic surround rumbling sounds, especially with the powerful sounds of the rocket at take-off that will really shake your room good and proper, but even more spectacular is when the space shuttle lands, as you get a tremendous booming sound that will rattle your speakers and make you guests jump out of their seats. Also during the lightning strikes in the storm sequence, this is one of the most vivid sound recordings of a storm on this IMAX film, and especially with the audio of the lightning happening with all of your speakers, this is truly sensational. The only downside is that when Toni Myers narrates, you have to crank the sound up slightly and of course when you get thunderous surround sounds, you have to then turn the volume down.

Finally, this is a brilliant view of the films IMAX BLUE PLANET + IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE on this Blu-ray disc, but lets face it, the magic of IMAX films is the ability to experience in the best possible way to view them actually in an IMAX cinema. Unfortunately, no matter how good your Home Cinema system set up is and unless you are one of those lucky ones who can afford to mimic the IMAX experience in your home, these IMAX films do slightly lose a lot of their large-format spectacular impact. This is not to say it does not look good in 1080p high definition, but the overall visual stimulation is brought down considerably for the smaller screens of the home cinema set up. But despite this, I am still glad I have these two classic IMAX films now in my Blu-ray Collection. So all in all Warner Home Video has given us two classic IMAX films that will stand the test of time and delivers some very fine and spectacular moments, especially the stunning spectacular breath taking views of Planet Earth, as well as outer space and having the feature film IMAX THE DREAM IS ALIVE is a stunning brilliant classic bonus. High-definition fans, your IMAX eye candy has arrived. Highly Recommended!
