8287627,1,B001CGJD9K,"I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this set.
Only one of the three discs has verbal narrative.  The other two seem to be, I only jumped through them from chapter to chapter, nothing but computer generated imagery and some actual footage of the earth shot from space.  As if flying around the earth or traveling through deep space passing galaxies.  Not even any text to tell you what you are supposedly seeing on screen.

The one disc, supposedly describing ""the challenge of space travel"" is nothing more than a highly unorganized attempt to describe the financial and political ""challenges"" of maintaining a space program.  A disjointed and non linear history lesson.

It seems to go without saying that this collection should be going into in-depth description of how a space suit is constructed, why it is constructed that way, what hazards the suit is designed to resist. Effects of weightlessness on the human body, strategies to combat or adapt to those effects, consequences of long term space travel on the humans involved, strategies to deal with those scenarios.

I mean seriously ? History, politics and TWO chill out vids to watch and let your mind relax ? ? ?
This set is CRAP.",1498262400,,1200,4.796116504854369
