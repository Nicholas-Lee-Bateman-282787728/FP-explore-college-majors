6422679,5,B00KDUGVHI,"...then this show is most likely right up your alley.  It follows the same action/adventure shonen style that every other Toei production has, but with a delicious twist: everything revolves around food.

I picked this up in Parts 1-4 on a whim (this collection will be parts 1 and 2 for a cheaper price) and was so thoroughly impressed by the level of creativity that went into this series.  Dont get me wrong, its pretty stupid, just like One Piece and DBZ and all those other shows that appeal to boys, but thats part of what makes it so great.  Though it can be very wacky it can also be very violent and there really are some good fights.  I will quote from one of the later episodes: ""theres a seed in that bird doo-doo...and its taking root in my shoulder meat!""  That may give you some idea as to what your in for, just remember to have food in the house when you watch it.  And if your gonna watch this and try to take it seriously (as if it were GITS or AOT or Neon Genesis) then your gonna have a bad time but then again thats probably your own fault for being unable to tell just by looking that this is a ""colorful"" show.

Funimation is almost always golden with their Collections and S.A.V.E. editions (remember your paying less) and this is coming from someone who owns all the One Piece and Fairy Tail collections as well as around eight S.A.V.E. collections, so im going to assume this will be a good product but im sure once its released other reviewers will give us all the details.  I will say that while it is unspecified at the time of the review I am almost certain that this will be released as a Blu-Ray/DVD combo, but don't bite my head off if im wrong, im just basing this off of more recent collections like Fairy Tail.

Theres even a movie crossover with Toriko/One Piece/DBZ if you don't believe me regarding how similar they are.  So you should check this out if you are into those shows, im willing to bet you won't be dissapointed.",1402185600,5,1964,4.33879781420765

8657970,4,B00KDUGVHI,"Its a quest of food. The shows funny, has in depth ridiculousness that makes the story have depth, and is just outrageous. Now i was able to sit through all 50 episodes of this series so it was good enough. Just beware though, its not as funny as you may think, has some serious moral issues that irritated me, but it has a great cast and just outrageous foods to conquer. For instance have you ever heard of Troll Kongs or a gararagator!",1427673600,2,438,4.289156626506024
