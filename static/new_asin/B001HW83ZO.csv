8309803,3,B001HW83ZO,"Let me start by stating I am not disparaging Kim Breed and Gary Wheeler's knifemaking abilities.  They are both much better than I.  I just find that the video does not live up to the price, however.

The information in the video is sound and intended for beginning knifemakers with limited heat-treatment capacity.  Still, most of the content can easily be found for free and of similar quality online.  ""Quality"" in this case refers to both the veracity and production value.  The audio is occasionally hard to hear owing to the use of what I presume is the video camera's built-in, omnidirectional microphone.  There are some issues with the video quality too as the camera struggles to maintain good balance between the dimly-lit workspace and the glare of an oxy-acetylene flame.  While the experts are indeed knowledgeable of their subject matter to the point of being able to ad-lib the entire video, the presentation is very rough and could do with either a script or outline.

As the title of the video implies, the only steels being heat-treated are simple, carbon steels.  Fine for beginners but intermediate knifemakers will likely seek tutelage about obtaining higher performance from carbon steels and developing techniques for more complex steels.

Overall, this is all the same stuff you've seen online in both video and text form.  I bought a used copy on the cheap, and I'm on the fence as to whether or not I regret it.  I certainly would not have felt that I had gotten my money's worth had I paid full price.",1254182400,2,1529,4.812260536398467
