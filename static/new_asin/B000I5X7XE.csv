THE BEST OF CM PUNK

This is a set that features CM Punk in his Full Impact Wrestling days and his Ring of Honor days.

Spoilers

1. VS VORDELL WALKER-Joshua Master comes out at the beginning and gives a little intro to Punk since they are The New Dawn. Now with this very first match you can see the superstar potential of Punk. His opening promo had the crowd against him just like he wanted, and he continued that during the match. This match was part of a tournament taking place in the first round. The match itself is a good one with Walker taking control early with the crowd support. He used a lot of power moves to take Punk out. Punk would come back though wearing the bigger man down. Walker would make a comeback though and show that he is actually pretty good unleashing move after move. But after Walker almost gets the upset but Walker costs him the match.
After the match we get a clip of Punk costing AJ Styles a match against Homicide [you know both from TNA]. Both guys are upset by this and take it out on Punk's follower Joshua Masters.

2. JOSHUA MASTERS VS HOMICIDE-this is actually a match that only features Punk in the corner of Masters. I like this though because you see how the storyline was developing and of course you know Punk is entertaining anywhere. The match is basically a squash as Homicide crushes Masters leading us even closer to Punk against Homicide.

3. VS JUSTIN CREDIBLE-that is right in the second round of the tournament we get Punk versus ECW vet Justin Credible. The match takes a while to get started as Punk plays the classic heel role exciting the ring every time they almost lock up. His interaction with the fans here is hilarious, I love the flip fries line. Justin takes control of the match breaking Punk down until Punk fakes an injury. CM immediately takes advantage of the ref holding Justin back and works on Justin's legs. It works as Credible can even finish a tombstone and Punk rolls him for the pin. Not as great a match as I would have thought they could put on but good.

4. VS RAINMAN-the third round of the tournament pits Punk against Rainman.  You can see one guy in the crowd who brought his kids and he is obviously having a great time. Don't know why but I just love that, and when he holds his daughter back from fighting Punk cracks me up [you'll see]. Now while this isn't the greatest match ever Punk obviously has the crowd in his hands. He makes them hate him like no other, and they are really into him being out there. Rainman losses control halfway through and Punk just lays into him. He lands a low blow and uses the ropes to get the win and move on to face Homicide.

5.[FIP CHAMIONSHIP]VS HOMICIDE-this of course was the finals for the FIP title and the match Punk had been dreading.  Joshua Masters attacks Homicide early only for Homicide to turn it around on the two heels. This match quickly turns into a brawl as the go to the outside and right into the crowd. Weapon after weapon comes into play and they soon move through the building. Eventually they make their way out side during a hurricane [early stages I guess the commentators say a hurricane is coming, to be fair it does look like the weather was going that way]. Back inside the building the ref lets them keep beating each other. This is a back and forth fight and fight is the right word. The match officially starts after they finally make it to the ring. Once in the ring these guys land move after move and Masters makes his presence felt once more stopping a near fall. It means nothing in the end as Homicide still pulls off the victory winning the belt. Easily the best match thus far.

Azrieal is the newest member of The New Dawn so we get Punk introducing him and cutting a promo. From there we go into the end of Azrieal's match with Rainman where we see Punk help his newest member win.

6.[NO DQ MATCH]VS DAN MAFF-Maff is a big boy and was Homicide's boy at the time so this fit into the storyline well. These two have met before so I knew this was going to be a good one, both are ROH vets. Maff runs the match from the start which leads Azrieal down to the ring and helping Punk put the beat down on Maff. This leads to a really interesting situation in which Maff becomes the ref, wait till you see it. The match turn s into a brawl as they go outside with Maff dominating most of the time. But in the end Punk takes this with his feet on the rope, all legal.

Next we get another Punk promo before he faces Homicide in a rematch later on.
7.[FIP TITLE FALLS COUNT ANY WHERE]VS HOMICIDE-these guys pick up where the left off and it isn't long before this one spills out onto the floor. Both guys go hard in this one as they make their way through the building and back outside. They even end up fighting on top of a delivery truck and brawling down the street. But the best comes when they make their way into a strip club. Some of the funniest moments ever in the history of wrestling happen here, Punk in particular had me cracking up hard at one point. The battle onto the stripper stage and finally back out onto the streets. It is here where Homicide gets the win and keeps his belt.

Next we get a glimpse of CM Punk entering the Florida Rumble which was a Royal Rumble style match. We get to see some familiar faces here and of course how Punk faired here.

8. VS JAMES GIBSON-now you may remember Gibson as Jamie Noble from his WWE days. This was actually a really good match. I only say actually because I was expecting another brawl but this was just a wrestling match. Great back and forth action from both men. Surprisingly for the last match on the DVD Gibson gets the clean win here.

BONUS MATCHES FROM ROH

1. VS RODERICK STRONG-the Ring of Honor matches is what most people will buy this DVD for and that is not a bad thing. These two put on a great match with Punk leading early and wearing down Roderick's arm. He continues to work the arm for the entire match  trying to break Strong down. Even when Strong makes his come backs Punk goes right back to those arms. This is a great match with an old school feel to it for some reason, love it. Both guys give it all they got and set a good pace. The reversals and spots here are excellent as both guys look great. In the end String taps to an anaconda vice. The fans reaction to Punk after the match just shows how much he was loved by them.

2. VS BRYAN DANIELSON-Ricky Steamboat was the special ref for this match and it should be noted that Punk attacked him earlier in the night. This is also a match up that I wish would headline Wrestlemania, come on Vince make it happen. Any way this is a match that you know is pure classic. This is such a great match with various holds and maneuvers. This match gives all the proof one would need to say that these are two of the best in the business today. From pure technical wrestling to some high flying and power moves everything is covered. In the end Bryan makes Punk tap but this was such a good match no one really lost in my eyes.

The rest of the bonus features an excellent look at CM Punk's time IWA, trailers and a music video.",1337126400,2,7145,4.279259259259259
8143974,4,B000I5X7XE,"I wouldn't call it a must-have, but it's still pretty good.
This DVD documents CM Punk's time in a few different indie promotions. What I found the most entertaining is the stark contrast from his previous alignment (ALWAYS a heel) to his current ECW Champion status as a face and all around honorable guy. Watching him call a girl in the audience a ""stupid b*tch"" when she leaned into his microphone-less hand to speak was priceless, and anyone who sees this will admit that Punk has a Dudley-like ability to piss off an audience. (Again, so strange, since the two times I saw the man live the whole auditorium was going insane for him).
It's a good addition to anyone's collection if they're a Punk fan, but hardly an essential as it's mostly matches and little to no promo or interview.
However, just in case you were interested, at the end of the IWA bonus reel, you can see his bare bum for about a full minute. That, my friend, was worth the price alone.",1191542400,,960,4.491428571428571

 C.M. Punk is without a doubt the one and only breakout star of the new WWE brand of ECW. But Punk didn't happen over night, he was carefully molded from several years of intense training and practice in some of the country's top independent promotions. Everybody knows C.M. Punk made a name for himself in Ring of Honor, but he also helped many other promotions grow into bigger and more profitable organizations. During the last few months of Punk's independent run (before signing with WWE) he was one of the impact players in an upstart promotion in Florida called Full Impact Pro. FIP is the baby sister promotion to ROH, using a lot of the same talent, but featuring a unique style influenced by the south (a style that would evolve over time). ""Declarations: The Best of C.M. Punk Vol. 1"" is a compilation of Punk's contributions to FIP.

Full Impact Pro relaunched on September 24, 2004 with a 1-night show entitled ""Emergence"" featuring a tournament to crown the first FIP Champion. This DVD features Punk's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd round matches plus the big Finale between he and Homicide. Also included is a crazy No-DQ match against Dan Maff, and the famous Falls Count Anywhere in Tampa match against Homicide which ended up inside of a local strip club surrounded by strippers (nudity not included). The last match on the DVD is a contender for the best match in FIP history which pitted C.M. Punk against James Gibson.

Final Thoughts: If you're a fan of C.M. Punk's ECW work, then you owe it to yourself to experience his pre-WWE stuff and this would be an excellent place to start. FIP is a great promotion and Punk was one of its early stars. He's a star everywhere he goes!",1172793600,4,1727,4.633986928104576

After buying it, I can provide some much needed information. The main part seems to be Best of CM Punk in FIP DVD which contains these matches from 2004: [...]. I haven't viewed this part yet, but will watch it over the weekend.

The thing that makes this DVD great is the Bonus Features.

* Bonus Matches from Ring of Honor:
vs. Bryan Danielson (Guest Referee Ricky Steamboat) ...ROH Reborn Stage 1 4/23/04
vs. Roderick Strong...The Future Is Now 6/12/05

* Bonus IWA-Mid South Career Retrospective:
This is the best part of the DVD which sets it apart from the ROH/FIP version of this release. It is a 40 minute highlight reel on CM Punk and all he has done in the IWA with highlights of many of his important matches throughout the years from 2001 until 2005. It was originally a bonus feature from the DVD version of IWA Mid-South's""No Blood No Guts No Glory 2005"" on July 2, 2005 in Valparaiso, IN.

Of course, you'll get clips of many matches against Chris Hero including the famous Tables & Ladder Match & 93 minute 'When Hero Met Punk' match. There's several matches featuring Colt Cabana. As an unexpected surprise, all three of CM Punk's matches against the late, great Eddy Guerrero are added which includes a 3-Way with an unmasked Rey Mysterio Jr., an IWA:MS Title Match, and a 3-Way with Colt Cabana in front of about 100 fans as written about in Guerrero's book.

You'll see highlights from Punk in several annual IWA-MS tournaments. First up is the Ted Petty Invitational tournament from 2002 against M-Dogg 20, ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels, Chris Hero, & BJ Whitmer. Next is the the initial Strong Style tourament in 2003 against Tarek the Great, Stan Dupp (WWE Raw's Trevor Murdoch), & BJ Whitmer. Then you get the Tag Team Title tournament in 2004 w/ Colt Cabana vs Nigel McGuinness & Chad Collyer, Havana Pitbulls of Reyes & Puma and Southern Comfort of Tracy Smothers & Chris Hamrick.

The end features a series of single matches which included the first one on one IWA meeting in over 16 months between CM Punk & Chris Hero, a match from the 8th Anniversary show against AJ Styles, another match against Chris Hero and this highlight reel concludes with a pair of entertianing matches against Delirious, the latter took place at ""Dedication"" a tribute to Chris Candido that contains Punk borrowing Candido's classic ""full moon"" spot. This IWA: Mid-South Career Retrospective was worth the price alone.

*Trailers
This section is a series of trailers from Big Vision Entertainment, many of which can be viewed at BVE's YouTube video page: [...].

* Music Video
This is from a southern California band, Five Victims Four Graves, who provides music for this DVD. They remind me of Hatebreed, a band CM Punk used for his entrance theme music in early 2003. Unfortunately, this is just the regular music video for the song ""Calling Back This S.O.S."" without any footage of CM Punk. This song can be downloaded for free and the video can be viewed at the band's MySpace page: [...]",1169856000,13,3173,4.725135623869801
