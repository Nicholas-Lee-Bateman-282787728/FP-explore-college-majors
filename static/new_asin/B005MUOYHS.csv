8479794,5,B005MUOYHS,"Judging by other comments, this appears to be the film also released as ""Return to the Hiding Place.""  My comments concern that film.  I know nothing about the DVD formatting issues....

Before today, I had never heard of Hans Posley or his connection to Corrie Ten Boom.  Assuming its historical reliability, this is an inspiring film.  Doing the right thing in the face of adversity is of timeless significance.  Heartbreaking and inspiring.",1426377600,,443,5.083333333333333
8479795,5,B005MUOYHS," Most important for non-Region 2 DVD viewers is that you will need a region-free DVD player.
 Good movie, portrays the horrors of Nazi occupation in the Netherlands, and shows the courage of the people who worked tirelessly to save other people's lives at risk of their own.
 Based on actual people and their heroic actions during WW-II.",1403308800,,337,4.87719298245614
8479796,3,B005MUOYHS,"Sometimes the acting is not the greatest, but interesting to see a story about how the Dutch dealt with the Nazi occupation of their country and the rounding-up of the Jews and the execution of those who were ""not normal"" like retarded kids.  It shows the Dutch as being very ""humaine"" in trying to save as many as possible.  Of course, there were corraborators, but, according to the movie, they were the exception, not the rule. Also shows the moral dilema between ""Christian"" beliefs like the need to always tell the truth and the ""Jewish"" beliefs.  As someone who is fascinated by WWII and how people behaved during it, this is a good film for my library.",1324080000,,659,4.615384615384615
