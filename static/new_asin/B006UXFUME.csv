8504833,4,B006UXFUME,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gopal-Krishna/dp/B006UXFUME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gopal Krishna</a>&nbsp;is a SUPERB 1979 Bollywood (Hindi) movie starring Reeta Bhaduri, Sachin Pilgaonkar, Zarina Wahab & Manher Desai and is based on the birth, childhood, and adolescence/young adulthood of Lord Krishna from Hindu mythology. Although I gave this movie 4 stars, its NOT because of the movie itself, but because of the DVD. Personally, if I could give the movie 10 STARS () I would!

I think this movie is one of the BEST (if not THE BEST) Krishna movie I've ever seen (and since the advent of DVDs/Blu-Rays and online video streaming, I've seen at least a few) and is definitely among the best Hindi movies in general. I probably wasn't more than 3 or 4 the first time I saw ""Gopal Krishna"" (there are childhood photos & home videos of me and my brother re-enacting/play-acting scenes, songs & dances, and characters from this movie when I was between 3-6 or 7). and over the years/decades I've seen this movie HUNDREDS, if not THOUSANDS (maybe even TONS more!) of times -- and yet so far, I've still never gotten tired of it (and in fact, I'm watching it AGAIN [for probably the TEN MILLIONTH time!] right now, as I type this!). However, despite my parents being from India (they were born & raised there and came to the US in their mid to late 20s and have stayed ever since) my brother & I did NOT see very many Indian movies growing up, even though some/many of my fellow first-generation ""ABCD"" (""American Born Confused Desi"") kids have seen lots of movies from India (and NOT just Hindi/Bollywood films but also regional-language movies like in Tamil, Malayalam, Telegu, etc.) FAR MORE than my brother and I. For a number of reasons, we saw very few Hindi/Bollywood movies during childhood & adolescence.

First of all, in those days (especially before the I.T./computer programmer boom & wave of emigration from India) when the Indian community in this country (especially in this area) was still pretty small, and the general interest in Indian food & culture and Hindi movies was not as prevalent & popular as it is now, Indian grocery stores & restaurants were very few and far between (one of my earliest memories are of traveling over an hour just to get to the closest Indian market to stock up on essentials -- now, in 2015, I can think of 8-10 Indian groceries & restaurants just within a 5 mile radius alone!). I was born in the late 1970s and even though VCRs had come out/were just starting to come out & gain popularity in the general public, it was very difficult & inconvenient, if not nearly impossible (at least around this area, at that particular time) to get Hindi movies for rent, let alone purchase. Even with home VCR ownership becoming more widespread as I grew up, and businesses like Blockbuster Video, started gaining ground, and even local public libraries began to stock VHS videos & movies for checkout/rental, unfortunately, for the most part (with a few notable exceptions) it didn't really cross over to the International or at least the Bollywood genre. Moreover, although, the Indian grocery stores also started renting out Hindi movies, because these shops were often still a very long drive away, the rental period was so short (typically around 1-3 days with no renewals/extensions), and both my parents worked demanding full-time jobs and were unable and/or unwilling to make such a long drive during the work-week just to return rented videos, it wasn't really feasible to rent Hindi movies very often, if at all. Also, UNLIKE these days when Bollywood movies are a staple feature at at least a couple (if not more!) local theaters, in those days, as far as I can remember there were NO theaters anywhere (at least within a reasonable distance) that screened Hindi movies (or ANY Indian movies) on a regular/consistent daily, weekly or even monthly basis. I mean, once in awhile, there'd be a Hindi movie showing at some specific theater for a special screening or something. But even then, usually the theater was too far away and/or only one scheduled showing (instead of a variety of dates, times & locations as is available with commercial Hollywood movies, and to a lesser extent, even independent movies). Although there probably WERE ways to see Hindi movies even in those days (goodness knows, many of my fellow ""ABCD"" kids of Indian friends of my parents/family friends saw plenty of Bollywood & other Indian movies growing up) for whatever reason, my parents weren't so inclined and/or didn't see it as a good use of at least half a day (all told -- both driving to & from the theater, and in the movie itself, since Hindi movies are usually at least 2 - 3 hours or more!) of their limited time outside of work and that was one of the several reasons we didn't see many Indian movies during childhood & adolescence.

Secondly, although my parents grew up in India and are multi-lingual, my brother & I were born & raised in America, and we grew up speaking English. At home, my parents either spoke both English & Konkani (an Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-European family of languages spoken on the western coast of India as well as being an official language of the state of Goa, and a minority language in the state of Karnataka and northern Kerala) which is our family/ancestral mother tongue -- and while my brother & I understood/can understand Konkani, we'd inevitably always answer back in English because it was just easier & what we felt most comfortable/fluent with, given that we spoke/had to speak English everywhere else (school, around the neighborhood, etc.). That is one of my biggest regrets -- NOT becoming fluent in Konkani and other languages while still young & able for them to be more easily learned & permanently ingrained. Anyway, even though my parents speak several languages (at minimum, my dad knows/speaks English, Konkani, Hindi & Marathi, and my mom knows/speaks English, Konkani, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi and possibly Kannada, I'm not sure), because my brother & I grew up speaking English with Konkani as a secondary language in the home, with the exception of the sporadic Hindi classes we took as children, we did not have much experience with Hindi. So since we understood/understand very little (just a few random words, phrases, etc.) of Hindi, and because in those days, English subtitles were not usually (with a few rare exceptions) available on the VHS tapes, and DVDs/Blu-Rays (let alone online video streaming) with English (and other languages) subtitles & captions wasn't even yet a conceivable mainstream concept, my brother & I had to rely on our mom for translation of the dialogue in the few Hindi/Bollywood movies we DID see. Although I'm sure she tried her best, what would inevitably happen is that while she was busy translating one segment of the conversation for us, she would miss the next one, so there would be huge gaps in the translation, and often essential dialogue would be accidentally or even DELIBERATELY (if she thought it was inappropriate and/or that we weren't old enough yet to hear it) left out of the translations. So we had to figure out the story from the scenes pictured and inconsistent & incomplete translations. As a result, we didn't watch many Bollywood movies growing up. I can count on one hand (with a couple of extra fingers!) or maybe two hands at the most, the number of Hindi movies I remember seeing as a child and teenager.

In fact the ONLY Hindi movies I remember watching during the first 13 or so years of my life prior to high school, was THIS movie (which, if I remember correctly [I was just a toddler the first time I saw it, so I *could* be wrong!] was originally given to us by a close family friend who, to the best of my recollections, bought it on a trip to India, had it converted and gave us a copy),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masoom/dp/B0016GOKD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masoom</a>&nbsp;(which was originally a movie rental [one of the few Hindi movies we'd rented] that got lost and paid to replace, only to later find it & have it for keeps), the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ramayana/dp/B0002AAMVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ramayana</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahabharat/dp/B00023JH72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahabharat</a>&nbsp;series (which my maternal aunt visiting from India first brought a couple volumes of -- and later got the rest from family friends and elsewhere),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deewana-Mujh-Sa-Nahin/dp/B000GHFYWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin</a>&nbsp;(which I saw in a movie theater in India during a 3 month summer trip in 1990) and maybe a couple others that I can't recall. Then, during high school I saw maybe a couple/few more Hindi movies. But still they were without English subtitles, and since those movies I saw in the theater (one of them during a HELLISH trip to India in my senior year of high school) I couldn't have my mom translate, I had to try to figure out the plot from the scenes pictured, and mostly watched for the song & dance numbers inherent in the MAJORITY of Bollywood movies (including THIS one!)

But since the advent of DVDs/Blu-Rays (as well as YouTube, Netflix and other online movie streaming) as well as the far greater availabily and accessibility of Indian movies in general, I've not only seen a lot more Bollywood movies (and other genre of Indian films) but I've also gone back and seen & gotten DVDs of childhood staples/favorites like Gopal Krishna and Masoom and I    them!

 WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! 

Gopal Krishna is an EXCELLENT movie that chronicles the birth, childhood, and adolescence/young adulthood of Lord Krishna from Hindu mythology, starting with Prince Kansa's coup d'tat & imprisonment of his own father, the righteous & honorable King Ugrasen of Mathura (India), Kansa's coronation & terrorization of his subjects, including his own sister, Devaki & her husband Vasudev, and how Lord Vishnu took human form, in the avatar of Lord Krishna to kill Maharaj (King) Kansa and put an end to his tyranny & oppression. This movie is primarily about Krishna's early years. It tells the story of his conception, and birth in the dungeons that Kansa had Devaki & Vasudev imprisoned in, about his surreptitious transport to Gokul to be raised in the home of Nanda & Yashoda, and Kansa's numerous attempts to find & kill him, and his naughty & mischievous childhood as a ""makhan chor"" (butter thief) who yet was endeared by all. The movie goes on to show his adolescence and young adulthood, including his close relationship with Radha, his consort, and the continuing attempts by Kansa to kill him (including Krishna's duels with the deadly serpent, Kaliya, the killer bull, Bakasura, and killer elephant, Kuvera), culminating in an epic battle with Kansa to the death!

This is an AWESOME movie, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone interested in Hindu mythology and/or epic films. The casting is OUTSTANDING and I  the acting of pretty much EVERY SINGLE character in this movie...........the actors who play the baby and young child Krishna as well as the young child Radha are ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE, Reeta Bhaduri and Zarina Wahab are WONDERFUL as Yashoda (Bhaduri) and adolescent/young adult Radha (Wahab) and best of all both Manher Desai (who plays Kansa) and Sachin Pilgaonkar (who plays adolescent/young adult Krishna) SHINE in their respective roles!

The only casting choice I didn't care for as much was the choice of the actress who played Devaki (Lord Krishna's birth mother) because IMHO, she tended to overact and was too weepy -- though given that her character was terrorized & imprisoned by her brother Kansa, who murdered 6 -7 of her children right in front of her (though in the movie they say that Kansa murdered 7 of her children, in the actual Hindu mythology, Devaki's 7th pregnancy was told to be a miscarriage and instead the baby was divinely transported into the womb of another woman, Vasudev's first wife, Rohini Devi to be born as Balarama, Krishna's brother/half-brother) and was separated from her 8th child (Lord Krishna) immediately after his birth, its understandable that the character was written as very weepy and the actress who played her tended to overact.

Other than that, this movie is FABULOUS, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 (or the 10 stars I'd give to the movie specifically) is because the DVD itself left a LOT to be desired. If Rajshri & Ultra had put just a little more time, money & effort into the manufacturing and ""editing"" of the DVD, I'd have had no problem giving it 5 stars. But unfortunately, its clear that they spent as little time, money and effort as possible rushing the production of his DVD, to pay attention to & avoid preventable defects of recording/manufacturing like abrupt cut-offs of scenes.

For example, in both this movie, as well as in the Hindu mythology this movie based on, because of a prophecy that the 8th child of Devaki and Vasudev, Krishna (as an incarnation of God -- the avatar of Lord Vishnu in human form) would kill the evil Maharaj (King) Kansa and stop his tyranny & oppression, Kansa is trying to find Krishna & kill him first, in order to prevent fulfillment of that prophecy. However, because Krishna was taken to Gokul immediately after his birth, Kansa orders that ALL infants in Gokul be killed. So the King's soldiers go on a rampage in Gokul, violently ripping infants from their mothers arms and brutally & ruthlessly killing them. There is a scene in this movie in which, when the King's soldiers get to the home of Nand & Yashoda (where Krishna was taken), Yashoda is standing against the door trying to block them from coming in to take (and ostensibly kill) Krishna. However, the soldiers burst in so forcefully, it sends Yashoda crashing to the ground, and knocks her out (into temporary unconsciousness). Anyway, due to some illusory tricks by baby Krishna (who is God [Lord Vishnu] in human form) the soldiers run away without him, and when Krishna's baby babbling wakes Yashoda from her stupor/unconsciousness, and she sees Krishna is still there, alive & safe, she grabs him into a hug and says ""Bhagwan Ne Bachchaliya Mere Laal Ko"" (God Has Saved My Son). But on this DVD (or at least MY copy of it) that scene is cut off in the middle of of that line and instead the movie goes silent for a moment until it changes to the next scene!

Also, although this DVD movie DOES have English subtitles, they are done VERY badly. First of all, the subtitles are NOT properly time-synchronized to appear right when the person saying the line (or lines) is ACTUALLY speaking it. Instead it either appears too early (before the person says the line[s].) and then disappears from the screen BEFORE (or by the time) the person actually says it -- OR it appears too late (after the line[s] have been said and the line[s] or at least the final part of the line appears in combination with the subtitles for whatever the next speaker is saying -- even if its a completely NEW scene AND even if/when someone else is already talking, thus, falsely making it appear to the viewer that its the new/most recent character saying those lines when it was the character in the prior scene!). If that's not bad enough, some/many of the translations are NOT even accurate and/or certain lines, phrases or words are omitted, and some translations of the dialogue are left incomplete. One example of this is the scene mentioned above, where Yashoda embraces/holds baby Krishna in a hug and says ""Bhagwan Ne Bachaliya Mere Laal Ko"" (God Has Saved My Son), and in the middle of that line, the scene abruptly cuts off and on this DVD (or at least my copy of it) not only is that scene cut off in the middle of the line, but NONE of that line is even translated with the English subtitles. Or for example, in one of the""makhan chor"" (butter thief) scenes of the movie, one night, Krishna & his friends mischievously enter neighbor Chabeli's house, and eat the butter/yogurt. Meanwhile Chabeli and her husband are sleeping in the next room (actually in the courtyard, I think) when they hear strange noises, and they have a conversation about what the noise is, and how the number of rats have increased in Gokul, and that those rats even have no fear of cats. Then Chabeli makes a comment asking ""But where is/ARE the cat(s), and though her husband says something in reply to that, the DVD never bothers to translate that last line AT ALL! Regrettably, that is NOT the only time that the DVD fails to translate lines or dialogue in this movie, or gives a wrong translation. In the aforementioned Chabeli scene, after Chabeli finds Krishna & his friends in her storage-room/pantry eating her butter & yogurt, Krishna's friends get away (mainly because Krishna creates a diversion [throws a couple handfuls of butter/yogurt in Chabeli's face to distract her] while his friends get away and he ""takes the fall""). However, Chabeli catches Krishna and ties him to a pole in her courtyard (to keep him there) while she goes to complain to his mother (but why she didn't just take him with her instead, to prove her contention, is beyond me!). When Chabeli reaches Krishna's house and sees his mother, she initiates the conversation by asking/saying to Yashoda something to the effect (remember, I'm NOT fluent or even conversant in Hindi, and only know some [though that's increasing the more Hindi/Bollywood movies I see] words & phrases) that, ""If you have milk, yogurt or butter, can you send me 2-4 pitcher/pots?"" but instead the DVD translation just starts off saying, ""shall I send you some?"" without even saying WHAT it is being referred to! Then after giving that incomplete/inaccurate translation, it goes on to continue the errors. Because after Chabeli asks Yashoda if she can have some milk, yogurt, butter, Yashoda says ""What are you talking about?"" (which if UNLIKE me, the viewer understood NO Hindi, and were completely dependent on subtitles, they'd probably be asking themselves that same question -- WHAT are these characters talking about?!?!?) and Chabeli replies by saying ""He (Krishna) does what he's been told not to do, what can we do?"" and instead the DVD translation abridges the subtitles to say, ""What else can I say?"" omitting the correct & complete translation of the line. Another instance of the DVD giving inaccurate (and/or incomplete) subtitles is in one of the scenes in which Krishna is leaving Gokul to go to Mathura to battle with Kansa, and as he's going, the chariot he's riding in, comes across Krishna's consort, Radha, lying on the ground in the middle of the road (a dirt path, but a road, nonetheless!). So Krishna gets down from the carriage and ask Radha what she's doing, and Radha replies that she is not going to let Krishna go to Mathura, and that if he's still going, that he (Krishna) will have to take her life first and then go. But instead the DVD subtitles changed the translation to ""I won't let you got to Mathura. If you have to go, go over my dead body"" which, while essentially means the same thing, still is NOT an identical translation of what was said. Which makes me wonder what other translations they may have similarly fudged (or even given wrong) & skated by on.

Unfortunately, these are FAR from the only examples (there are countless more -- too many to list here!) of the problems with the subtitles and other manufacturing defects -- and this is NOT the only Hindi movie DVD with these kinds of issues. My DVD of ""Masoom"" has the SAME kinds of problems with the subtitles, and the abrupt cut-off of scenes in the middle of lines or dialogue and disjointed/jerky moves to the next scene. I don't know why that is -- I've never noticed those problems on most (or really, ANY!) of my other Hindi/Bollywood DVDs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kuch-Kuch-Hota-Hai/dp/B00004W4GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge/dp/B00ZEBDIF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kabhi-Alvida-Naa-Kehna/dp/B0038WU0D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>, my 3 disc set (Two Disc DVD + CD) of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taare-Zameen-Par/dp/B001N6FPRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taare Zameen Par</a>, my 2-disc set of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veer-Zaara/dp/B00A48KOJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veer Zaara</a>&nbsp;or others. Thus, I suspect that the manufacturers of the DVDs for lesser-known, or lesser-publicized (UNLIKE the modern-day Bollywood blockbuster hits of the present-day) and older Hindi movies like ""Gopal Krishna"" & ""Masoom"", are skimping on the production costs, because they don't see the DVD sales of these movies being as profitable as the new movies getting tons of Internet and media press worldwide. Its a shame that they don't realize that if they put out a quality product, even if its for old(er) movies, that long-time & loyal fans of those movies will still buy them, even if they already own it. For example, I already owned VHS versions of both ""Gopal Krishna"" and ""Masoom"" when I bought the DVD versions -- and if they come out with a GOOD-QUALITY Blu-ray version, I'd still get it AGAIN (but it would have to be BETTER [and NOT identical to or worse] than the DVD for me to do so) on Blu-ray, even though I already have the DVD!

Because I    this movie!

Although the DVD itself is mediocre, the movie, IMHO, more than makes up for it, and I HIGHLY recommend it for all but the youngest and/or most sensitive of children (as a child and occasionally, even now, certain scenes in ""Gopal Krishna"" used to scare the hell out of me!)

Gopal Krishna is an EXCELLENT film -- the casting is PERFECT (or as close to perfect as its possible to get), the acting is EXEMPLARY, and the clothing & jewelry, especially the women's are ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS (when I was a kid I LOVED [and envied] the dazzling, shimmery twirly skirts and the beautiful jewelry on Yashoda, and Radha, and to a lesser degree, the other women). Granted, the special effects (such as the scenes with Kansa) are crude & primitive compared to today's standards and available technologies, but considering this movie was produced in 1979 India, its understandable, and is still a GREAT movie, nonetheless!

 3 STARS for the DVD +  5 STARS (if not, a LOT more!) for the movie itself =  4 STARS!!!!!!",1445644800,2,22924,5.084507042253521
