If you liked Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Sunshine Cleaning then this one is for you.  I LOVED IT!",1342396800,2,264,4.346938775510204
5113908,2,B007XF0XZM,"Extremely boring. Witty as all hell but its a chop-chop movie that moves from one scene to another with no warning of what happened in the last scene... it seemed unfinished.... and it goes on tooooooo long.... some scenes could have been left on the editing room floor. Others, shortened. Most of the acting is good, but I think this is a sleeper something you'd watch when you are snow in - under forty feet of snow in Alaska with a broken leg and a cathiter up your pie hole.... sleeepyville.... snore...snore....snore... two stars for the acting.",1342051200,2,550,4.680412371134021
5113909,5,B007XF0XZM,"This film won't be for everyone, and that's a shame because it's charming, delightful, touching, funny, and exceedingly well acted! The script is witty and the storyline is quirky - I enjoyed every minute of it!",1337731200,3,211,4.888888888888889
5113910,4,B007XF0XZM,"""The truth is, Henry, you are a miracle of modern medicine."" After ten year old Henry (Spevack) is suspended from kindergarten he has a talk with his grandfather. When he is told that his grandfather has located his half-sister Henry finally thinks he has a chance to find his father. This movie started off very funny and almost held it the whole way. The humor is pretty dark at times and you laugh at things you don't feel like you should. The kid that plays Henry is very good in this and so is the girl that plays his sister. I really like these kind of movies about dysfunctional families for some reason. Michael Sheen's character is especially funny and I hope he plays more roles like this. There isn't really anything new or amazing to this one but it is very entertaining and funny almost the whole way through. I recommend this. Overall, not really anything original but the actors make this very much worth seeing. I liked it. I give it a B+.",1336694400,7,955,4.462857142857143

5113923,3,B007XF0XZM,"When you watch as many independent films as I do, you know you're going to come across a few weird ones. Jesus Henry Christ may take the cake though, as it was really out there. 10 year old Henry Herman (Jason Spevack) is a genius, with one of the highest IQ's ever recorded. This genius was actually a test tube baby, and his lifelong goal has been to find out where his genius comes from. It's certainly not from the Herman family, which is the definition of a dysfunctional family, so whoever it is, has to better than them. Henry will come to discover that his father is a college professor, who wrote a book about how to condition your children to be gay from birth. He has a sister too, who thanks to her father, is the laughing stock of her whole school. When the two halves of Henry come together, hilarity ensues in this screwball comedy. Young Jason Spevack stars, and while he's just a kid, his character was super annoying. If you hate people who think they are smarter than everyone, try watching a kid who knows he's smarter than everyone. Thankfully, there is more to the movie then the musings and rambles of young Henry. His Grandfather and half-sister are both hilarious, and easily are the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, they don't have huge roles, and the film is left with simply moments of hilarity. Overall, Jesus Henry Christ is a strange film, with a few funny moments, but generally it's pretty slow and uninteresting. Toni Collette of Sixth Sense fame is the only person of recognition in this cast, but her role was so insignificant, that she doesn't do much to help an otherwise young and inexperienced cast. While it's not a bad film, Jesus Henry Christ isn't great either. It has it's moments and the story is somewhat interesting, but unless the storyline interests you, I would go ahead and skip this one.",1417910400,,1846,4.580060422960725

5113926,5,B007XF0XZM,"This movie was wonderful. I would not recommend it for family night, but it is a great independent film that has a great plot twist within the story line. The, mostly unknown, cast was remarkable and did an amazing job. They make you feel their pain, hurt, intuition, guilt and anxiety for their situation.

5113930,5,B007XF0XZM,"This was the second time I saw this movie because I liked it so much.  I think it's hilarious, and I think the 10-year old boy actor did a great job being an exceptional high IQ kid.  His sister did a great job too.  She has the looks of Mona Lisa.  She's very pretty, and a great actress.  Some day she'll be very famous in Hollywood for sure.  I look forward to seeing them working together in the future.  Loved this movie.
My experience watching this movie from Amazon wasn't the best one because I had to call customer support for interrupted play every couple seconds.  He was suppose to credit my account, but so far, I haven't see that.  It's not usual that I get to have this problem playing movies from Amazon, but that evening it did happen.  The customer support said the bandwidth was high, and that he was going to report to his team for observation.  I have the fastest internet there is from AT&T U-Verse.

5113935,4,B007XF0XZM,"Director Dennis Lee tackles a lot in this project, and he may have bitten off more than he can chew, but I still enjoyed the heck out this quirky romp.

Here's the scoop. Henry Herman is a genius ten year old, with an eidetic memory, who lives with his mom in Chicago. He finds out through his grand dad that he was a test tube baby. He now sets out to find pops and the adventure leads him to people and places unexpected. The possible candidate as dad is a professor (at the university which Henry is now enrolled) and a sister (maybe half sister) who is twelve years old and screwed up because pops wrote a book about her being lesbian. It's a long, thoughtful and unexpected journey.

Okay. Toni Collette plays the mom. I like her to begin with. I've liked everything I've seen her in. She's good as the radical mom who loves her son and has had a tragic past. She's lost, in one way or another, everyone in her family save for her dad. The camera plays off her face like a concert violinist plays a Stradivarius. Michael Sheen has also been good in everything I've seen him in and he doesn't disappoint here. He's bright but screwed up. He doesn't realize the harm he's done his daughter. He's disconnected. Grad dad is a hoot. A bit coarse perhaps, and almost totally useless at running a house and family, but he's real and comes through in the end. Jason Spevack is a hoot as Henry. He's too bright for his own good but uses his intelligence to work toward good. Then there's Samantha Weinstein as Audrey. With her pale face, almond eyes and straight carrot hair, you can't keep your eyes off her. She's an interesting character who starts hard and softens by the end.

The sets, shooting, editing are all as good as they had to be to get this done. Some of the kooky framing added to the overall oddball appeal. I liked the soundtrack. It has a lot of tunes that well heighten the emotional level of a given scene. As I said, Lee takes on a bit too much, and uses the end to further some of his own agendas. But the plight of the outsider, the question of what actually constitutes family, and coming to grips with one's place in things are all worthy subjects. The end seems tacked on but I liked these people a lot and wanted to see where they were going. I liked this a lot and its quirkiness helped keep me in the game.",1355788800,,2332,4.30751708428246

5113940,5,B007XF0XZM,"This was a fantastic movie highlighting our responsibilities to one another as well as addressing what exactly makes up a family.  Aside from that, it was clever and more than a little dark.  Very beautifully done with great acting.",1347235200,,232,4.923076923076923
5113941,5,B007XF0XZM,"4.5 stars

This was a pleasant surprise in most every way. Fine acting by all, especially Spevack and Moore, a very sharp and mature script, and lots of interesting camera and lighting/color work make JHC its own little world. The rather slow pacing might bore some but I found it rather relaxing on the whole, especially when paired with the many dark laughs throughout. This is a film by and for sharp and unconventional minds who don't mind taking their time to think things over. That's kind of the point, in fact.

Writer/director Lee has a Wes Andersonish feel and that's a good thing, all in all, as he also has his own personality and sense of heart that we found very appealing.

The dvd is a nice transfer with 30 minutes of cast interviews that shed some light on the odder sides of the film, where you see why Spevack worked so well with the entire cast: the kid's a natural talent.

Not for everyone, particularly impatient folks quick to take offense, J. Henry Christ nonetheless holds many pleasures for those who don't mind it slow, weird and colorful. I think Lee has many more fine films in store for us, as does Spevack. And they made a special one here.",1343174400,,1173,4.518867924528302
