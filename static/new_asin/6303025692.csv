539416,2,6303025692,"I remember renting this movie and how I could't wait to see Wil Weaton in a horror flick. I was a bit disappointed in the boring plot in which he plays the wimpy hero. It's not that scary and may put you to sleep. So take a nap before you sit down to watch. I was being generous on giving it two stars but as a pre-teen[as I was when it was first released]I was a big Wil Weaton fan. If you are too,then stick to watching Stand By Me.",983750400,,434,3.8333333333333335

7835248,5,6303025692,"After watching this DVD for 10 minutes on my own, I ran to get my wife, and started over again.  She says it is ""perfect"".  Some of the manifestations were immediately recognizable by any PMS sufferer (and any who live with and/or love them) and are humorous as such, but it's much more than that.  ""The Curse"" is a love story, a humorous horror flick, a chick flick (of sorts), and a story of true friendship.  Few movies illustrate the depth of unconditional friendship and the development of unconditional love better.  This is a great one!

I know it's not necessary, but I want a sequel.  I fell in love with the characters, and I want more. At the very least, I'd like some more movies out of the talented writer, director, and producer - Jackie Garry.

Warning - If you're looking for typical Grade B horror, or a mega-budget stunning effects film, you won't find it here.  This is a classy, funny, real, romance/friendship/horror flick.",1142294400,,944,4.63855421686747
7835249,5,6303025692,"i came across this film quite by accident. made in new york for some $30,000 with a 4 week shooting schedule, two years in slogging post production hell, then a distribution deal and a scheduled release date of october 2001 -- whoops, can't release a movie that takes place in new york in october of 2001, so it sits on a shelf for another two years and finally ...
since there was no for special effects or to blow on sets or costumes, this movie was forced to survive solely by the power of its script and acting performances and it succeeds. it succeeds in being funny, scary, and romantic all at the same time. bitten by a fellow patron at a manhattan lingere sale, our heroine, frida, (played capably by Amy Laughlin) finds that her PMS is getting worse and worse every month and that, in fact, she has become a PMS werewolf, changing into an animal and ripping dates to shreds every 28 days. can true love save her? how long does it take to get rid of a human arm in the garbage disposal? who is that devilishly handsome police officer?
the bonus features include two seperate audio tracks with general commentary and a second with tips on how to make an indy horror flick (""don't use SAG!"", spend money on an audio director, hire a DP with his/her own equipment)",1069027200,10,1269,4.427350427350428
7835250,5,6303025692,"AWESOME!  Finally, some creativity.  This movie is a cool, modern ""horror"" flick.  It's got it all-a good storyline, great photography and shots of NYC and well thought out editing.  I highly recommend this movie--it's very entertaining.",1057795200,6,237,5.5
7835251,4,6303025692,"This film was a wonderful surprise.  Very refreshing change from the Hollywood take on werewolf films or from ""B"" movies.  ""The Curse"" is more of an artsy indie film with a ""feminist-in-a-fun-way"" sensibility.  The lead actors are all new faces and the love story between Amy Laughlin and Mike Dooly is both funny and touching.  The filmmakers were very innovative in working around their budgetary constraints in this low-budget film.  I also found the commentaries interesting and informative.",1057622400,5,495,5.294871794871795
7835252,5,6303025692,"I've been waiting forever to see this movie, and now that I finally have, I can safely say that it was worth the wait and I wasn't disappointed. It's a highly entertaining and witty horror comedy, with some good performances and a well written script to top it all off. The final product is really impressive considering the low budget. I guess it just goes to show you that if you have a solid script with a talented director and cast, you can still make a ... good film regardless of the small budget.
The cast of pretty much unknowns was great. Amy Laughlin was very likeable as Frida. Mike Dooly also really impressed me. The romance between the two was sweet and adorable. I was shocked at how well they seemed to connect. They really had some very nice chemistry together, and I couldn't help but get into the scenes they shared, especially towards the end. It was just so effective, I was really surprised. Sara Elena Knight was enjoyable as Jennifer, Frida's best friend. They had a good relationship together, and I liked how Jennifer would stick by Frida through pretty much anything. Now that's a real friend.
Overall, I couldn't help but get sucked into this one. You really couldn't ask for much more out of a film with such a low budget. It was funny and very entertaining. Unfortunately, not many people know about this movie. And the people that see it at the video store will probably pass it up, because they'll think it looks like some ... straight-to-video ""B"" horror movie, instead of a smart independent film. It's sure to be one of the most little-seen and underrated films of the year. However, with good word of mouth, The Curse should be able to have its own following someday, and possibly become a cult classic. I can only hope it finds its audience.
I highly recommend it!

7835254,1,6303025692,"Oh boy. Okay, this stink bomb is supposed to be H.P. Lovecraft's 'The Colour Out Of Space' but I think anyone that has read that story would be adequately nonplussed by this theatrical attempt. The story involved a good, noble farmer and his family destroyed by a cosmic vampire evil. In the movie, the farmer is an abusive creep like some kind of poorly-acted Cotton Mather with an equally creepy family (all except for the little brother and sister.) Unlike the poor family in C.O.O.S., I liked seeing vile things happen to the family from The Curse. And when I say vile I mean VILE. Dirty maggots squirming inside apples, vegetables that spew sticky purple filth. I mean, this isn't the story, it's just garbage, cheap shock-value. There was no pervading star-spawned/supernatural menace as in the story. Just alot of bad acting, even worse plotline, cheap dime store gore and little or no explaination. I would advise that you skip the movie and pick up a Lovefraft book containing the story (which I think our kindly friends here at Amazon do have for sale.) If you want to watch a pretty good Lovecraft film, I would recommend the Dunwich Horror (also an Amazon item.) Two thumbs up on that one. Two thumbs down---way down---to the Curse. It took me about six months before I could look at a tomato the same way.",1005523200,,1318,4.685344827586207
7835255,3,6303025692,"This is one of the best late '80s horror films of it's day. Along with Wil Weaton of ""Stand By Me"". When a meateor falls to earth on the back lands of a country farm, who knows what kind of evil it will unleash in the ground? Through the slime that ooozes out of the glowing meateror ball, which contaminates the water and the food that the farmer Nathan Crane grows...everyone will be cursed with evil! Except for Wil Weaton and his true life sister which escapes the house and it's cursed inhabitats by luck. The film is great to watch with the lights off and with a bowl of popcorn and pop. The photgraphy is a little odd, but interesting, along with some great slimmy icky scenes. ""The Curse"" has a beautiful and great haunting music score in which I love (I wish I had the soundtrack!). I believe the director is the actor David Keith of movies, who I believe if not mistaken the one who played Drew Barrymore's father in ""Firestarter"". I only wish Anchor Bay would put this movie out on DVD in widescreen? I give this movie a big great 3 stars!",998006400,2,1050,4.33502538071066
