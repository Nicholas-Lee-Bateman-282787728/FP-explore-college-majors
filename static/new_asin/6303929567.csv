728342,5,6303929567,"This is without a doubt, Taylor Thomas's best movie, much better than Wild  America.  It just seems that he is a natural for comedy, like his role in  Home Improvement.  The soundtrack for this film is good too; there's a way  kewl song during the wedding scene near the end---""Return to  Innocence"" by Enigma.",965347200,,310,4.648148148148148
728343,4,6303929567,"it was a cute, very well explained relationship between a mother and son that is suddenly weakened by the boyfriend. unsuspecting, the boyfriend, [chevy chase], is pulled into a chain of traps, but in the end, they find  peace! VERY CUTE!",946425600,2,238,4.804878048780488
728344,4,6303929567,"I loved this film.  Thomas begins as a selfish kid who tries everything to dampen any relationship between his mom (Fawcett) and his soon-to-be-step-dad lawyer (Chase).  Chase meanwhile tries everything to  gain his soon-to-be-step-son's friendship.  Not easy when the kid's own  father left him and his mom years earlier after breaking so many promises.  Having to prove himself as trustworthy leads Chase to enlist himself and  Thomas in the Indian Guides, a somewhat odd club of fathers and sons out to  enjoy life.  While Chase learns from the dads, Thomas makes new friends  with such great fun child actors as Spencer Vrooman and Zachary Browne.  Chase and Thomas finally bond during an organiszed camping trip, during  which local mobsters attempt to kill Chase after he is assigned to  prosecute them.  In typical good wins over adversity fashion, father and  son become a family as Chase marries the ever sweet Fawcett at the movies  end.  You'll watch this film again and again.  In addition, it features a  great soundtrack.",925603200,2,1035,5.053571428571429

728513,4,6303929567,Solid purchase! Quality is great and came just as expected. One of the best movies of the 90's!,1512691200,,95,4.333333333333333
728514,2,6303929567,"I guess Chevy Chase was the main reason that I originally wanted to see this film, since I've always been a fan of his National Lampoon vacation films (Except Vegas), Caddyshack, Fletch, and Funny farm. But this one did sadly show Chevy's day was passing him by, not as bad as in Vegas vacation, but he just didn't have as much anymore what made him so fun and likable throughout the 1980s. Christmas vacation was the last movie Chevy was really good and funny in.
11 year old Ben, (Home improvement's Johnathan Tayler Thomas) and his mother (the late Farrah Faucett) shared a nice two storey apartment, and carried sad memories of her ex and Ben's father walking out on them when only 5. Ben at 11 though was another brat who thought he knew so much more than anyone in the adult world, and he sneered down to and talked bratty to his mother's new boyfriend Jack (Chevy).
Ben was not the geeky kid in school that got bullied. A couple of bigger kids that were bullys really didn't bother him or stuff him into the locker until they saw he was befriending their usual victim, a small geek Jim who was stuffed into his locker daily, and Ben tried to foolishly take them on. Then the 2 big bullies stuffed him into a locker too.  Jim was an Indian guide who Ben didn't like at first but soon, after joining the guides, started befriending him.
Ben didn't want to join the geeky Indian guides with Jim, but only did so dragging Jack along because he thought that would get rid of Jack. Ben made it his mission to get rid of Jack. Even Jack found the guides too geeky, and asked Farrah ""why can't he just join something more normal like little league?"".
Next issue, the late 1980s to early/mid 1990s seemed to think that a PG film was never complete without those dumb cartoonish gangsters such as in Getting even with dad, Houseguest, Baby's day out, and even Three men and a baby. More realistic portrayal of gangsters such as in ""Goodfellas"" with the F words and more explicit actions of the gangs couldn't be shown in a PG family film. So instead of just leaving them out like they should have, they had to throw in the stupid, cartoonish gangs.
Jack was a prosecuting attorney, who helped in sending a gang leader up the river, so the gang leader's son and his goons made it their mission to take care of Jack, and spent the movie tracking him down, cutting his car breaks, etc.
Ben was plenty bratty to Jack. Jack was not your typical jerk stepdad, and he actually tried his best to befriend Ben. Therefore, Ben ended up finding the most trivial things to get irritated with Jack about, such as calling him Benny instead of Ben, and making eggs Benedict for breakfast and then Ben whining about Jack trying to kill him with animal fat. Really now. I remember how back 20-25 years ago when animal fats were thought the prime cause of heart disease, where in more recent times people have realized now that the enemies are transfats and high GI carbs.
I liked the addition of Cheers' George Wendt as one the Indian guide's father. Chevy gets advice from him on how to handle Ben when going to his woodwork teaching job at the highschool. This is the second movie that George Wendt played a highschool woodshop teacher, the other being the movie Plain clothes with Arlis Howard. But his woodshop character there was alot more psychotic than in this movie.",1511136000,,3354,4.498360655737705

729991,5,6303929567,"This movie worked and it was in top notch condition, first of all.  Jonathan Taylor Thomas has always had something about him that I enjoyed watching, perhaps it is that air of intelligence he displays while delivering humor on a golden dish and still having these eyes that reveal his emotions.  I related with his character.  This boy was abandoned by his father, whom left with his secretary, so it was he and his mom for a long time.  Men entered and exited, always ""waving goodbye,"" or disrupting their happy and content life together.  This character, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), is a relatable character and not just to children of broken families or single parents.  His attachment and dependence on his mother and their close relationship gives way to his antics when Jack (Chevy Chase) comes into the picture as his mother's (Farrah Fawcett) fiance.  He thinks this guy must be another schmuck and makes it his duty to find everything he can wrong with him to justify his mischievous attitude in regards to him.  He is hesitant to ""let him in"" and develops a plan to get rid of him for good.  This comes after Jack, a respected prosecutor, puts away a ""big man"" in the gangster underworld.  This man's son also swears he will avenge his father's conviction by ""getting"" Jack.  Ben's plan is to join the Indian Guides, after finding a tiny kid in his locker wearing an Indian vest and had brochures for this father-son group centered on a Native American theme.  After a little camp out and Ben painting up Jack with a type he was allergic to, Jack has problems at work when he is dealing with a case revolving around the disrespect of Native Americans.  In turn, Jack has an idea of his own and presents an Indian chief to Ben.  After a rain dance, Ben ends up coming around and not hating the Indian Guides so much afterall.  The ""bad guys"" get Jack and cause a riff between he and Ben, then come back for more when that plan fails...  I don't want to give away the end or some of the other highlights, but this is a story about family in a more modern society with very resourceful kids.

730105,5,6303929567,"If you do not know about this movie, then you are about to be served with a treat unlike any treat you have ever received.

It stars Chevy Chase, who IMHO has just gotten funnier over the years, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (the star of Home Improvement) as nutty people saying the zaniest things.  Disney scores another home run with Man of the House, and the comedy grabs you by the throat from the very first scene and never loosens its grip.

If you've never seen any Chevy Chase movies (and what's wrong with you, if so?!) then this is definitely the one to see.  He is very, very sarcastic which is my sense of humor too, and he has some of the funniest faces and zingers that you'd ever want to see/hear.  But he has definitely met his match with the kid from Home Improvement, who delivers wisecracks like kids always do.  This kid is definitely going places and is by far my favorite person from Home Improvement, except for maybe Tim Allen and Wilson the neighbor.

Farrah Fawcett has never been more gorgeous and whimsical as she is in Man of the House, and what's so funny is that Chevy Chase wants to marry her, but the kid really doesn't want him too.  So it's a lot like Home Alone, except instead of people wanting to burgle the home, this kid wants to keep the intruder (Chevy Chase, ""Oh Heavenly Dog"") away from his mom.  And we can all relate to wanting to keep people away from Farrah Fawcett, so it's a comedy that makes you think.

This movie is probably going to make one of your top 10 lists, and it's so funny at times that you might need to excuse yourself from the room.  But remember to pause lest you miss more great jokes and joke premises!

Man of the House?  More like Comedy of the Year?!!!",1196726400,9,1721,4.32398753894081
730106,5,6303929567,Typical Chevy Chase vehicle but still enjoyable. Farrah Fawcett looks too old to play a young mom. Good movie to watch with your Grand children on a rainy afternoon.,1190851200,,165,4.724137931034483
730107,5,6303929567,"When you realize that this DVD features both Chevy Chase and Farrah Fawcett, you are instantly suspicious since neither have made a good film in a long time since Fletch.  However, add Jonathan Taylor Thomas and the three make a believable modern-day family thrown into turmoil over Jonathan Taylor Thomas' dislike of anyone trying to win his mom's (Farrah Fawcett's) love.

When the mobsters show up chasing after Chevy Chases character, the film comes into it's fullness and makes for a great movie with a satisfying ending.",1143072000,,526,5.0344827586206895
730108,4,6303929567,"Starring Farrah Fawcett Majors (Sandy, the divorced mom), Chevy Chase (Jack, the hot shot lawyer boyfriend/fiance who moves in with the divorced mom) and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (son, Ben, who has unresolved feelings of abandonment due to his real dad, suddenly and unexpectedly without remorse, having left him and his mom). The film is a classic comedy where Ben does what he can to test the new ""dad-to-be"". In fact, his whole plan is to drive Jack out of his mom's life. The fact is ... his plan backfires.

Jack does whatever it takes to win Ben over. He even joins the Indian scouts, a group in which Ben feigns interest, which he expects will send Jack over the edge. Surprisingly, it has the opposite effect, Ben ends up looking forward to the adventures in the wild, especially a planned canoe trip. Unfortunately, it is the one time Jack does not show up ... convincing Ben, Jack is like his dad.

Bigger problems loom in th horizon for Jack, who is nearly killed by the son of a mob-type stalker and his buddies who are exacting revenge for having placed his father in jail. The climactic build up and suspense in the film is worth viewing for oneself. This is a family entertainment style film where all the problems are resolved in the end. The film is amusing and makes the viewer feel good. While much of the film is predictable, that is why it does not disappoint the viewer. Erika Borsos (erikab93)",1138060800,21,1414,4.58498023715415
730109,4,6303929567,"As a Chevy Chase comedy, Man of The House is far from his funniest; however, it works well as a family drama.

The story's sort of an inverted ""Courtship of Eddie's Father.""  In this case it's the boy's mother (Farrah Fawcett) who is single, and the boy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas of Home Improvement, Tom and Huck, etc.) is wary of her new fiancee, a prosecutor named Sturges  (Chase).  Still feeling burnt by his ex-dad, the boy tries everything to get rid of the prospective one.  Some of this is funny, like when he paints Sturges's face with Indian war paint that won't come off, and the parts that aren't funny are still interesting and help develop the characters and story.  I think the film is most effective in that it demonstrates the persistence of faith necessary to build a family, as Sturges doesn't give up on the boy, but continues to try to win his friendship after each prank by the boy, and each failure of his own.  Competent acting by Thomas helps the film succeed on this score.

The subplot is about a hoodlum Sturges sent to prison, and his son and his thugs trying to get revenge on the prosecutor.  Mostly this is supposed to be funny, but doesn't live up to Chase's usual standards.  However, it does weave a bit of suspense into the story and provides a catalyst for Sturges to finally win over the boy's sympathies, as well as a climax with some action.

The supporting cast includes George Wendt (Cheers), who's mostly serious in this role, and Art LeFleur, who's funny as an Indian Guides martinet.

If you're looking for a hilarious comedy, don't look here; but if you're in the mood for a light family drama with a well-devoloped message and some humor, Man of the House will foot the bill with one family values caveat:  Chase and Fawcett move in together before they're married.",1118966400,,1811,4.586956521739131
730110,1,6303929567,"I give this movie an ""A"" for ""avoid.""  Definitely the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure to watch (and yes, I've seen ""Angel Eyes"" so I do have a valid point of reference).  Chevy plays a guy makin' bacon with Farrah Fawcett (yes, I did just vomit) while Jonathon Taylor ""Buy a Last Name"" Thomas plays the petulant little crapface son who is anti-Chevy from the start (let's face it, who isn't?) and makes his life a living hell.  The acting is atrocious, the characters are poorly developed and hideously predictable, Farrah's nose appears poised to melt off at a moment's notice, and that little brat from ""Home Improvement"" couldn't be more annoying.  There is only one moment that is midly amusing (when JTT names Chevy ""squatting dog"" as his Indian Guide name), but too bad I heard that punchline in a joke my dad told me in 1982.  This movie is so bad that when Chevy drives his SUV off a bridge while rushing home to fulfill a promise to JTT you actually find yourself praying he can't open the window to escape.  If you enjoy banging your head against a wall, eating glass shards, or applying a curling iron to your bare skin, this is the flick for you.  Otherwise it is pure, unadulterated waste that a coprophagic dog would even avoid.  Trust me, if you value your retinas, avoid, avoid, avoid.",1103155200,7,1311,4.548936170212766

730167,4,6303929567,"Man of the House is a sweet little film. It's great for children without being drudgery for their parents to sit through. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays Ben, a child afraid of getting emotionally hurt again by the men his mother begins dating after his father leaves the two of them alone and heartbroken. Due to Ben's mistrust, he ""tests"" each of his mother's new potential suitors, and none of them can stand their ground until he comes up against Jack. From there, the rest of the story starts rolling. Man of the House is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something lighthearted but still-entertaining for the evening. Although, I'm sure the kids would probably enjoy Tom & Huck and Wild America much better since they're both more action-oriented movies.",1089504000,9,775,4.923664122137405

Chevy Chase was OK better then Farrah Fawcett but under Jonathan just a little still loved his performance. Chavy gets a 8 out of 10, Farrah gets a 5 out of 10, Jonathan gets a 9 out of 10.
They was all good actors and actress but Farrah and Chevy have made to many movies for an older group unlike Jonathan Taylor Thomas who was at that time still in kid movies.
It is about Jack Sturges (Chevy Chase) has found the woman (Farrah Fawcett) he wants to marry; unfortunately, her precocious, wisecracking son (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) doesn't seem to like him. So Ben (Thomas) tries everything to get Jack Sturges to hide the road but along the way they join the Indian Guides, a sort of bush league Iron John outfit. While participating in silly wilderness rituals, Ben and Jack of course develop mutual respect. And meet up with some of the craziest of people and Ben soon starts to learn Jack isn't going to give up so easy.
Along with George Wendt, Richard Portnow, David Shiner and John Disanti.
I think it is an amazing movie for kids and adults funny, smart, wild, and entertaining for all ages. I loved it and as a 15 year old you know it was a good movie how many 15 year olds do you know that would type all of this on just one movie?",1049500800,2,1393,4.361538461538461
730171,1,6303929567,"Chevy Chase has always been the laziest kind of comedian, and even at his best is mostly just a foil for cheap one liners and sight gags. Thanks to Saturdy Night Live, millions of people are used to watching for 90 dull minutes just to see perhaps 10 or 15 minutes that are at all funny. The ratio of funny to dull in this movie is even lower though. The worst part is the ""Indian Guides"" which are scathingly and shockingly racist in a way one wouldn't expect from Mr Chase the Alleged Liberal. A great deal of the movie is devoted to seeing just how much the cast and movemakers can mock and denigrate American Indian cultures. The audience I saw this with didn't laugh at any of it, they actually BOOED, and loudly too. Save your money, this awful film leaves you sick to your stomach.",1043971200,,788,4.331081081081081

What happens next is wonderful, however what started as a plot to get rid of him starts to make Ben see some good points in him. However, if this wasn't enough Jack has a loony bunch of criminals trying to kill him for sending their father to prison. I won't tell you anything more for it will give away the plot.

Thomas is a cute actor, but can't overcome the poor writing.  Chase is embarrassingly bad here.  Why should the boy like this stranger who is shacking up with his mother?
