8359970,5,B002APNCDK,Pretty interesting pyro show. Been waiting for this price to come down and I now finally got it...,1410652800,,98,4.5
8359971,3,B002APNCDK,"Very good quality video. 4 Short Features with even shorter Extras, consisting of Trailers for 2 of the Features, and a Photo Run Through of the setting up of the 2009 New Years Eve Fireworks. First Short Feature is a very quick preview of Scenery around Taipei. Feature 2 - 2008 New Years Eve Fireworks - not too bad until you see Feature 3 - 2009 New Years Eve Fireworks. Definitely better than 2008! Then, again, a very fast run through of various Lantern Festivals throughout the Land. A Good Price to sell this would be $19.99, Excellent $9.99! Glad I bought at Amazon.ca where it's $10 cheaper than Amazon.com. This DVD had a lot of potential to show more of the Country and it's Natural wonders. A more detailed and informative showing of the Firework Setups, and done with Video, Not Photos, plus an added commentary would have added more value to this DVD! Excellent choice of music, but some of it got a little repetitious. At the current selling price, I'm glad my daughter gave me the Amazon Gift Certificate which I used to pay for it. If the price drops down to the prices I've mentioned, then it would be not too bad a deal",1277164800,,1138,4.475961538461538
