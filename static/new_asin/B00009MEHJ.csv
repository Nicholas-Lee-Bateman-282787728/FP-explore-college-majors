7991495,3,B00009MEHJ,"Quite a bit of this movie was filmed at the University of New Mexico campus while I was an Engineering student. I watched  them film a few scenes in between classes. The production tied up a lot of things around campus but the actual production process was interesting. Sparks was an appropriate title because there were a lot of sparks flying during filming between the director and the sound guys, they even threatened to walk off the set over some issue with the directors headset that he had angrily thrown down on the ground.",1468108800,,530,4.638297872340425

7991498,5,B00009MEHJ,"This was filmed in Albuquerque, NM in Oct. '89.  My son was 17 months old and we just so happened to be in Old Town on Halloween Day.  Although it took all day and almost everything was edited out, my son is in a tiny part at the beging of the fiesta in Old Town.  He is the little clown for about 2 seconds. lol  I never thought I could find this film since it was a ""Made for TV"" movie.  This is a film that I have not only talked about but can show.  Oh the fond memories.",1305244800,,475,3.7474747474747474
