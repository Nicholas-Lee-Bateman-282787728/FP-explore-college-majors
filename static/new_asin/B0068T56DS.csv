We were planning a vacation exploring the Mojave about a year ago, so I ordered the CD.When it wouldn't work, I contacted him. Turns out the CD is not compatible with Macs. He gave ma a subscription to his site instead, which has the contents of the CD and more. Plus, he e-mailed me several times to ensure I was happy and gave me some other tips for the region. All very friendly and with enthusiasm. All of the information I got from his site really enhanced the trip. The site had a lot of things with which I was already familiar, but with new information about them. It also showed me a lot that I didn't know. If you are considering a trip to the Mojave Preserve, this product will help it be an even more rewarding experience.",1375747200,,795,4.306666666666667
