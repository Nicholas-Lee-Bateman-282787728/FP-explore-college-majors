8224436,2,B000WOA7T8,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase.  I wasn't even able to get through it cause it constantly stops.  I tried it on two different players on my laptop (Coral WinDVD bluray and VLC media player) and they both freeze up.  I even tried it on my normal DVD player hoping to get through it, but the same thing happens, it freezes up in the very first song. When I took it out to see the back of the DVD, it's all scratched up and dirty.  It's unfortunate cause this is the first DVD of many that I've ever purchased on amazon.com that I'm not happy with.  I've been fortunate enough to always give good reviews, until now.",1330387200,,623,4.2905982905982905
8224437,5,B000WOA7T8,"This DVD is excellent. Because it's so good I wish I had bought both ""Story Teller's"" and ""Hard Rock Live"" indivdually. And maybe someday I will.",1215993600,3,145,4.615384615384615
