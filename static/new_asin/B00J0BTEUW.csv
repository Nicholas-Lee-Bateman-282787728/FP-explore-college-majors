I robot would not play the last half of the movie.  I cleaned it twice with a. DVD cleaning kit without solving the problem.  Jumper played all the way with no hiccups on the same Blu-ray player.  I actually found a thumbprint on the I robot desk.

I had no problem getting this disc set replaced by Amazon.  Still, I'm going to get the short version of Independence Day.",1435881600,2,549,4.313725490196078
