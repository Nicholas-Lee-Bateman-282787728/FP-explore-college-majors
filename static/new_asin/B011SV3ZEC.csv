8725042,1,B011SV3ZEC,Horrible.  Very limited drills shown.  Most of this video is one agility ladder drill with 10 different various hand movements added to it.  I didn't buy an agility ladder video to learn how to do hand gestures.  I have never used an agility ladder before.  If you are looking for agility ladder drills this is not for you.  This is more of a focus/coordination drill video.  Very dissappointed,1499644800,,394,4.705882352941177
