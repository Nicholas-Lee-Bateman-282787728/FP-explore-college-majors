1861623,4,B00008T79O,"Man, in my quest to find all the movies that I watched and loved as a child this is one that I have look for forever. WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD!!!!!

  The whole idea of an alien possessed bulldozer is beyond belief, but it is great fun to watch. The cast sells it well and really it is one of the better sci-fi/horror movies that T.V. gave us during the 70's,besides Clint Walker is one great hero.

 LET'S GET THIS ON DVD, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1177113600,14,578,5.9156626506024095
1861624,5,B00008T79O,Clint Walker's stoic style has been admired since his days as Cheyenne Bodie.  The Cat D-9G featured in this movie was long reconized as one of the early powerhouses of the earth moving industry. It's a great flick to watch with some of your heavy equipment buddies even though some of the scenes are a bit hokey. It will help to have a few shots of tequila to get the most enjoyment and have some great laughs from this film.,1167782400,9,426,4.325
1861625,3,B00008T79O,"Beleve it or not, there were a number of good made for tv movies made during the 70's. This was one of them.

 The idea for the story is a good one. An unknown unseen life-

force, alien to our earth. Is accidentaly released from its milleniums of slumber. It starts attacking by entering a bulldozer brought by a constrution crew sent to build some sort of project on a remote island.

 The rest of the movie is spent with the crew trying to stay alive, while fighting this unseen evil force.

 This type of plot device,(murderous machines) was popularized by Steven Spielberg's breakthrough tv movie ""Duel"", also made in the 70's.

 While not a great movie,(only 3 stars). Its still would be a nice addition to any collector's library.

Hopefully it will become available on dvd or vhs.",1147737600,25,788,4.60431654676259
1861626,4,B00008T79O,"From the same vein as The Car and Duel, Killdozer involves a bulldozer that comes to 'life' and begins to attack the members of a construction crew on a remote pacific island.  While the acting and effects were sufficient enough for a film of this type, the director's lack of creativity in building suspense makes it a slow watch but still very worthwhile for fans of Clint Walker or 70's schlock sci-fi.

Even at 70 minutes, they were kinda stretching it primarily because of lack of suspenseful scenes or creativity in cinematography. It probably would have been better suited as an episode of The Twilight Zone.

A nice find for fans for the sci-fi genre and those who enjoy the creativity required for low budget efforts. Just be sure you see The Car and Duel first, in that order...",1144281600,3,788,4.654676258992806

1861651,5,B00008T79O,"Great old movie. I watched it as a kid, and could never find it again. It is one of those movies that sticks with you, and many times I have heard it brought up by other old timers, who also could find it, and we all thought we had its name wrong. My son, who runs equipment, got a hugh kick out of watching it.",1483833600,,311,3.8
1861652,3,B00008T79O,"Released to TV in 1974 and directed by Jerry London based on Theodore Sturgeon's novella, ""Killdozer"" stars Clint Walker as the foreman of a small construction team 200 miles off the coast of Africa. Things go awry when a malevolent alien lifeforce is released from a meteorite that crashed on the planet hundreds or thousands of years ago. The thing possesses the bulldozer that tried to move the rock and proceeds to pick the men off one by one. Who will survive, if any?

I realize that this was an ABC Movie of the Week so you have to have mercy, but many of those flicks were quite good and sometimes great, like ""Tribes"" (1970), ""Duel"" (1971), ""The Night Stalker"" (1972), ""Kung Fu"" (1972), ""Go Ask Alice"" (1973), ""Pray for the Wildcats"" (1974), ""Winter Kill"" (1974) and ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" (1975), amongst others. ""Killdozer"" is cut from the same production cloth, but it's done-in by the limitations of its plot. My title blurb IS the movie and, as such, it's filled with dull 'filler' scenes and dialogue.

Walker always makes for a great protagonist and the other 3-4 main guys are decent, but they're limited by the thin story and general lack of pizazz. As far as the former goes, there's probably about 45 minutes of material here, which would've worked for an hour show (with commercials), but 74 minutes is just too long. Concerning the ""lack of pizazz,"" the story needed SOMETHING to perk it out of its doldrums, like perhaps a fetching female co-worker and the corresponding rivalry over her affections or fighting to save the proverbial 'damsel in distress' or vice versa. I don't know; I'm just making suggestions. When you have a confined location and only a few characters you have to get creative with the dramatics or events in order to maintain the viewer's interest (2007's ""Wind Chill"" is a good example). As it is, the movie's just a handful of guys stranded on an island with a slow mechanical, hulking adversary.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Carl Betz, Neville Brand, James Wainwright, James A. Watson Jr. and Robert Urich.

The movie was shot on a filming ranch in Valencia, California, as well as the nearby coast.

Go figure THAT!  Truly a mind-boggling and baffling omission.  And that's just one example of many such omissions of worthy films!

1861687,4,B00008T79O,I rather like this mid-70's made-for-TV sci-fi movie.  A meteorite lands on an isolated island and remains dormant until a construction crew awakens the body-less entity within and it possesses a bulldozer.  The self-animated machine starts to pick off the men one by one.  The men seem satisfied with no explanation as to why this is happening.  Still the film isn't bad.  The Universal Vault Series DVD-R is pretty good quality.  Recommended for fans of the genre.,1448755200,,466,4.987012987012987

1861736,3,B00008T79O,"The Made for TV movie has a long lineage that, at one time, was rife with thoroughly enjoyable movies with solid plots, believable acting and the sort of moderate thrills that made television of the late sixties/early seventies a sensation that almost put Hollywood out of business (that may be hyperbole but that doesn't understate the popularity of television during the time). There a number of great TV movies that were made during that time, and ""Killdozer"" isn't one of them.

That's not to say ""Killdozer"" is bad; it's just not on the level of, say, ""The Night Stalker"" or ""Trilogy of Terror"". It's an entertaining, cheesy ride with a science fiction tinged horror story. The premise is ridiculous, yet it works because the actors take everything serious; when the bulldozer continues to pop out of nowhere not unlike Jason Vorhees in a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, the characters never bluster or sneer. Instead, they react like a real person would.

Even at its quick length, I think this one is stretched too thin and could've used a slower beginning so we could get to know all the characters better. Kelly, for instance, is an alcoholic foreman on his last chance, but we're only given that information in a quick expository scene, and it barely plays a factor in the ensuing plot. Even with these shortcomings, this one sets right there with ""The Intruder Within"" as a TV movie that did it's ludicrous premise justice.",1410825600,,1428,4.8244897959183675

Killdozer was great fun at the time, but simply does not hold up as well as the latter three, and a number of others from that era. The casting and acting are only okay by comparison, and the writing is not as solid. Relatedly, while the other movies I mentioned have a reasonable degree of character development (especially Night Stalker), Killdozer lacks in this regard too. Nor does Killdozer develop suspense as successfully as the others. Don't get me wrong: if you are a 70s TV horror/scifi aficionado, or saw it as a kid and are waxing nostalgic, you should see this movie. But for me, while I find myself re-watching the other three movies every year or two, seeing Killdozer one more time was sufficient.",1390089600,,905,4.592592592592593
1861758,4,B00008T79O,"BOTTOM LINE: Bloodless and yet still tense & entertaining (in a minimalist way), KILLDOZER is silly sci-fi nonsense and a fun guilty pleasure flick. Originally being a TV movie-of-the-week also means that it's safe viewing for every member of the family. 4 STARS

STORY: A meteorite hits the earth, conveniently, right next to a huge Caterpillar D9 bulldozer. The blue crackly ""energy"" given off brings the dozer to ""life"" and turns it into a killing machine! This all takes place on a remote island being turned into a resort of sorts, so of course the small crew of workers is cut off from civilization and any chance of help or rescue. That keep things simple (and the budget low) and ratchets up the tension a few notches.

THOUGHTS: This is one of those made-for-TV movie of the week Boomer kids remember seeing on TV back in the 1970's. The film has gone on to earn a cult status over the years and was almost impossible to find, except in grainy bootleg copies. The film is a quick watch, moving along at breakneck speed. Clint Walker is the imposing leader of the small construction crew, and the others are just fodder for the D9 to flatten. (The film is based on a 1944 novella by renowned science fiction & fantasy scribe Theodore Sturgeon.) Watching this again after so many years, I got the feeling that this movie must have been responsible, at least in part, for inspiring Stephen King's MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.

THE DVD: An on-demand DVD-r release from Universal's 'Vault Series' - which means zero extras. Picture & sound are fair but routine. No bonus features of any kind. Kind of a bummer they didn't round up any of the cast or crew for interviews or a commentary, but that's okay... I mean hey! It's KILLDOZER! On DVD! Isn't that enough!?",1388966400,3,1755,4.65483870967742
1861759,4,B00008T79O,"As so many others have pointed out, buying this film was nothing more than an attempt to re-live a guilty pleasure from my childhood. In the early to mid-seventies, unless you had lots of disposable income to frequent the theater or drive-in (we didn't), the other option for movie entertainment were the made-for-TV offerings from the 'Big Three' (CBS, NBC, ABC).

Movies like 'Killdozer' were far from the best, but still a few steps ahead of the worst. The plot involves a D-9 bulldozer being possessed by an alien intelligence. It then goes on a killing spree. The dozer used appears to be Caterpillar's classic D-9G, complete with its rear-mounted 'ripper', it had a menacing appearance even without the alien. No explanation is ever given or even suggested for the machine going after the construction crew. The premise, at face value, just seems so ludicrous that you'd think it could NEVER work. How slow or stupid do you have to be to NOT be able to avoid a lumbering bulldozer? And yet, it was the idea that was frightening...that an other-worldly intelligence would possess a soulless machine and turn it into a methodical, cold-blooded, albeit slow-moving killer.

Faults? By the dozens. Why does the machine never run out of fuel? Why does the African island look more like a location on the West Coast of the US? Why can't the guys ever hear this bulldozer coming? Is it because Clint Walker keeps shouting ""Let's get out of here!"" at the top his lungs? And yet, for all its faults, the movie is still a hoot to watch. 'Independence Day' had holes in its plot as well, and that film received far more accolades than 'Killdozer' ever will. But director Jerry London, having nothing more that a handful of decent actors and some second-hand construction equipment, gave us a film that continues to inspire viewers today.",1388275200,6,1832,4.8126984126984125

1861799,4,B00008T79O,"From the fantastic year of 1974 comes ""Killdozer,"" a killing machine epic from director Jerry London. On a tiny island isolated from civilization a small construction crew is working on a job site. If that wasn't enough to depress them, a meteorite crashes to earth and an evil alien being possesses their bulldozer, transforming it into Killdozer, complete with glowing headlights for eyes! The special effects are cheesy and the script is quite contrived, but despite its ridiculousness I liked this in a hokey movie way. I was particularly entranced with the scene where the bulldozer collided with the meteorite and absolutely loved when the sentient dozer destroyed the radio, the only link to the outside world for the embattled and rapidly decimated crew. At every turn Killdozer proves its intellect and vengeful spirit is superior to the humans...they plan to blow it up, it destroys their camp, etc., but humans are a stubborn lot and have one last trick up their sleeve. I am particularly grateful for the bulldozer versus steam shovel duel, which gave me a good laugh while furthering the plot immensely.

The script is quite melodramatic, especially given the loopy premise of the film, but the cast (headed up by Clint Walker, Robert Urich, and Carl Betz) is good and the acting is better than you'd expect. It's true that ""Killdozer"" is not a conventional classic, but for the genre and the budget it's a better movie (and certainly a more entertaining one) than most people would suspect, with only the special effects and an occasionally over-the-top screenplay as detractors.

No. But there's just something about this effectively well-made little thriller that up adds up to a total enjoyment package for me, a fan of this type of entertainment.

1861803,3,B00008T79O,"Killdozer is a slow moving vehicle in more than one way: as the titular killer vehicle it moves cumbersomely yet inexorably toward the workmen on an island development; as a story the pace plods.  What happens in this movie doesn't happen quickly and can be seen for the most part a mile off, even as the men can usually see (and hear) the possessed bulldozer from afar.  Still, this macabre piece of equipment (genuinely threatening in its own right) manages to surprise the workers from time to time, gaining an unexpected upper hand.  The tension in the movie is allowed to build slowly with a foreman who has battled the bottle and is under constant suspicion from his underlings.  Still, once enough dudes die the evidence of the killing machine is filled in all and it is a fight for survival against long, if not slow, odds.

This old made-for-TV movie doesn't contain the types of chills that one normally associates with horror movies; it takes its unnerving attitude from the feel of a good Twilight Zone episode (reality has been tweaked just a bit and all one can do is survive it) and one of the great things about it is that it doesn't bother trying to explain the phenomena.

1861806,2,B00008T79O,"When I saw this was out I jumped at the chance to get it.  I remember the movie fondly and the original story even more so.  I found out that that was bcause I'd read the original story more recently than I'd seen this TV movie.

Over the 32 years since I'd seen the movie it had acquired a patina of quality that the actual film didn't sustain.  I now know why - my memory had edited out all the dross and 'additional material' thrown in to bring the movie up to time (or so it seems) and to add depth to characters who, in the opinion of one of the screenwriters I'm guessing, weren't three dimensional enough to hold the interest of TV viewers pining for the next episode of ""McMillan and Wife"".  They'd forgotten it was supposed to be about the bulldozer!

Clint Walker provides the stand-out performance - I would say the second-best of his career behind Vernon in <i>Scream of the Wolf</i> but the rest of the cast might as well be dump trucks on a building site.  The 'killer' dozer has as much screen presence as a Tonka toy and is as menacing a figure as you ever saw - on ""Romper Room"".

Okay, so that's the movie.  What I remember about the movie was that you could actually hear the dozer and the dialogue.  The sound on this DVD is terrible!  Get this on Netflix or whatever you have and teach the DVD's makers that you're mad as hell and aren't going to take it any more.",1354924800,2,1385,4.228136882129277

As far as I'm concerned, it's held up fairly well in the intervening years.  The script is taken from a 1944 novella by Theodore Sturgeon.  The plot isn't complicated; a few men are working on a small isolated island when something from outer space crashes on the beach.  While using a bulldozer to remove this bit of space debris, a man is killed and the bulldozer becomes possessed with an alien presence.  From that point on, it's strictly run for your life.
What I particularly like about this movie is the way they managed to make each man a solid character, the danger quite real, and the killdozer a force to be reckoned with.

I was around seven years old when I went to see the film and it sort of spooked me out. It's odd though how old movies from one's past suddenly starts to haunt them many years later.

You remembered much more about the plot than I did! Whenever I tried to think about the darn thing it was like trying to remember something through a foggy dream. I recalled a speeding car, powered by a mad woman with glowing eyes. (sort of like the witch in the Linda Blair movie, Summer of Fear). Also, important question; did she walk around a big flea market at the beginning of the movie? It looked like it was on the grounds of a drive-in parking lot. Does this sound familiar to you? Let me know please. Like I said, it's like a blurry dream with only snippets of moments.

I'm the only horror movie fan in my family so none of them remember anything that they took me see when I was a kid. But I remember,clear as day,them taking me.(my uncle took me to see Crash! and 'Day of the Animals' but doesn't remember)  My dad took me too see 'Food of the Gods' and fell asleep, so, I'll let him pass on that. But he does remember, a little bit, when taking me to see 'The Car'. I can sit for hours and tell my mom when, and where she took me to see films like, 'Deep Red' 'Eyeball' 'Shadow of the Hawk' and 'Lipstick'...(all at the drive-in. She thinks I'm making the films up. It kinda sucks. Kinda hurts, because being an only child, leaves me with very few resources to hunt down really old flickS that I experienced and forgotten the title. And, there's not many. There's about two or three that I encountered that still haunt me till this day that I can't figure out. One,a backwoods monster movie on late nite tv......another,a sci-fi/end of the world b-film at the theater, both sometime in the 70's. Are you any good with old b-films? I only ask because you remember Crash! And, that's as rare as a film one can get.

Anyway, I sidetracked, sorry. Finally, after a few years of searching on the internet, I found clips of the movie on Youtube. Also, if you don't already own it, Crash! is ready to buy on the site I-Offer. How the copy looks, I don't know. But, I think I will finally take a gamble (now that your remark on the film has rekindled the fire) and buy the darn thing.

Thanks for bringing back those weird, distant memories of a screaming woman and a killer car. Movies sure are spellbinding at times. Especially when one is young. That's why I love em'!  Thanx for reading- Kevin Brian- hope to hear back from you.

Ps- This review is actually a response to the guy who mentioned the movie Crash! in his Killdozer review. But if anyone else out there is good with remembering old horror films, especially of the late-night to rare, variety, let me know. I truly would hate to leave this world without ever knowing the name of the films I mentioned above. I could really use your help. Thank- Kevin",1341360000,,3054,4.328671328671328

1861828,4,B00008T79O,"While this isn't one of the really great horror movies it certainly is good entertainment. I liked it enough that I recorded it from tv onto a vhs tape the last time I saw it (some 20-25 years ago). One added benefit to getting it from broadcast television is the inclusion of some classic commercials from the time including one by the 'California Raisins' and a potato chip commercial starring Justin Wilson. The premise of a bulldozer running amok and trying to kill people may sound squirrelly at first, but it really works in the movie. The movements of the blade almost convince you the machine is thinking and planning its moves. One last note of interest: this flick doesn't use cgi, it doesn't use 'claymation(tm)', it doesn't use anything other than actors and real machinery! The director did a bang-up job of creating an atmosphere of believability. If you can find this hidden gem, buy it.

Note: Not related to this movie. In the mid-1070's I saw a flick about a black Camaro that chased some guys down after they caused it to run off the road. The owner of the Camaro was a girl who picked up a keychain with a troll on it from a flea market before the wreck, then ended up in the hospital as a result of the wreck. The keychain was still in the ignition and the troll commandeered the car and began seeking revenge. It was a lot like ""The Car"" in that nobody was driving the Camaro. I don't remember the name of the movie but am hoping somebody else will. Any replies will be appreciated.

Update 11-7-13
Thanks to some replies I found ""Crash!"", the movie I was searching for. Unfortunately, the transfer was horrible and much of the flick was difficult to watch. Maybe someday it will receive a decent treatment and release. Also, I bought the DVD release of ""KillDozer"" and just watched it last week. The transfer was adequate but not spectacular; a result, I suppose, of this being a made-for-tv movie with a limited market appeal. Still spooky the way they made that dozer blade move. My wife was unimpressed with the idea of a murdering machine, so I won't even try getting her to watch the Camaro going on a rampage - lol. I guess The Walking Dead has jaded her a bit and made her less susceptible to being scared, although The Exorcist will do it every time.",1289260800,7,2281,4.507246376811594
