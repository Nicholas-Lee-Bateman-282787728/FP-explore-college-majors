8268565,5,B00187164S,"This is a wonderful, intimate portrait of an extraordinary man. As the painter creates a new work throughout the film, we experience his love affair with art and how it relates to early man's expression of the world surrounding him and to music. Through interviews and historical footage, the film explores the artist's inner being from which his art springs. Born in Germany 1920, Fritz Rauh began working with an art  mentor at age fourteen. In 1940, he joined the German army and served for 10 years. Captured in 1944, he was held in a Russian prison camp for six years. Of the 750,000 German soldiers imprisoned  only about 50,000 survived. Fritz was among them solely because of his art. Initially he was forced to dig graves in the cold, barefoot, with little to eat. Later he painted 100's of propaganda portraits on the barrack walls in exchange for extra food. When he speaks of this dark part of his life, a deep sorrow fills his eyes. Black and white war footage shows the grim wreckage of a country from which Fritz entered a world of hope evident in his painting. He met his wife, Alix, in an art school and it was love at first site. Photos of them at this early age add depth to their portraits. She came from a long line of artists. Her uncle brought her to America in 1953 and Fritz joined her a year later. That first love and devotion still shines through both of them as they smile and touch each other during the film. His life in California is in stark contrast to the world he left behind. His first solo exhibition was in 1956. By the end of the film when we see much of the painter's work, we've grown to love him and his wife because they emerge as two sensitive, gentle beings. The producers have delved deep into their lives and revealed their souls.",1211760000,3,1778,4.450920245398773
