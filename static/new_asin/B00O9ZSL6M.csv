6730725,5,B00O9ZSL6M,"This is very current and ""In the news"".  I teach High School Current Events and we watched this when we were learning about ISIL.  We learned that the correct term for ISIS is ISIL which stands for The Islamic State of Islam and the Levant (Levant meaning ""area of land"" which includes land around Turkey, Syria, Palestine, and Israel. My students have watched the news call them ISIS, then ISIL, and in the last week the news organizations have just shortened it all to IS or The Islamic State. Again, very real world relevant and gives a great background to my student.  Would definitely recommend for High School students.",1438473600,,625,4.715596330275229

6730734,5,B00O9ZSL6M,"UNPOLISHED BUT VERY INSIGHTFUL DOCUMENTARY REGARDING THE RISE OF ISIS.  HITS MOST ALL THE IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHTS - WITH WELL PLACED INTERVIEWS

This excellent overview of the events leading to the rise of ISIS is outstanding for the prescient commentary of the people they interview and the footage they have assembled.  It is not particularly polished, so don't expect a History Channel style dramatic rendering.  It can be a little dry and slow despite the importance of the content.  For those who are interested, it can be very gripping.  For those with little knowledge of the region, it will help you understand why a Suni populace that is secular and educated would welcome a minority of extremists in with open arms.  My intent is to comment on the program and not give political opinions, though I have them.  This program also does an excellent job of not being overly political.  That is not to say individuals who are interviewed don't give political views.  They do.  However, the program interviews persons from inside the administration and from opposing views.  Mostly they give balance.

THE PROGRAM ITSELF:  Begins around the exit of US combat troops from Iraq, the political purge of Suni's from the government, the war in Syria and opportunities it offers for former Al Qaeda in Iraq as well as other extremists, ISIS move into IRAQ, fall of Mosul, battle in Kobani and questions posed for today.  The show brings together an exceptional group of interviews with US and Iraqi officials (including exiled Sunis), analysts, former commanders, US security officials, Think Tanks, regional specialists and others.  All have very prescient comments and insights to share about the events and in some cases give you an insider's view.  The footage is as seen on CNN in some cases with slightly less fidelity, but other footage adding to the story, sometimes even slightly more brutal is show as well.  The audience is still spared the very worst of what could have been shown though.

I mentioned the show is generally fair and is not specifically an indictment of the Obama administration.  There are officials on each side giving perspective.  Policies are stated as a matter of fact so the audience can decide if they agree.  Nevertheless, it's hard not to feel frustration while watching this program.  Maybe even a little sick.  There are clear policy failures, and difficulty to define the way ahead.  I will say the program describes early on that Maliki misunderstood comments by Obama which suggested he should follow his own path dealing with a terror threat.  Actually, the program more just describes the event and the implication is that Maliki became emboldened to deal harshly with Sunis.  I am just a little skeptical on Maliki's timing of that call and his actions against the Sunni official afterwards.  Almost anyone who has served there will tell you that a purge of Sunis from the Iraqi government was almost certain to happen once the US left, no matter what anyone said.  What that scene does set up is a miscalculation by Maliki as he comes back later, hat in hand, asking for US help as his government teetered on the brink of chaos.  Instead, we insisted that he step down before the airstrikes were accelerated.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Though one hour really can't tell you anything in depth.  It does give a very valuable overview of events in a reasonably fair way.  This is especially so for anyone who simply has little to no exposure to these issues.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested.",1420588800,11,3534,4.902192242833053
8682871,4,B00O9ZSL6M,"Video should have explained the Shia-Sunni split in greater detail.

This video is the only place I've seen that shows the fact that Colin Powell mentioned Zarqawi in his U.N. speech 21 times, and then he claims that he doesn't even remember putting him in the speech!

Another good video to watch is the episode of 60 Minutes that aired in September 2014 (find it on YouTube). Here, Leon Panetta (defense secretary) and King Hussein of Jordan both told Obama three years earlier (in 2011) that he better nip this Syria thing in the bud. Then look at what happened.",1499644800,,565,4.64

8682875,3,B00O9ZSL6M,"Good review on the rise of ISIS and the implications to the world.  This documentary explains some of the most recent events that led to the formation of ISIS, especially in Iraq.  It doesn't cover much of Syria's civil war, although it is mentioned. The amount of experts that are interviewed in this documentary is good and their opinions are great!  Some of the violent images shown in this video are quite graphic so I'd recommend caution if you're going to show this video to high school students; they're not that many though. Frontline does a decent job in this documentary by showing the terrible monster that ISIS has become without showing much of the violence it preaches. The video however, fails to capture the role of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in the creation of ISIS, as well as that of Osam Bin Laden's or even Saddam Hussein's. This video also focuses too much on the Iraqi government of Maliki but falls short to explain the divide between the Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq--as well as in Syria.  Nonetheless, for a 55-minute account on rise of ISIS, it's a good primer.",1460246400,,1080,4.668421052631579

8682878,3,B00O9ZSL6M,"Why did Frontline back off when it came to identifying American and Europe's dependence on oil as the underlying source of all this happening. And you can see that when the Big Oil companies were threatened that is when Obama took action.
If the U.S. devoted all the money spent stealing crude oil/resources from other countries we would be fully independent energy wise.
I think its time to force the Oil companies to foot the bill for their exploits!",1448496000,,452,4.734177215189874

""As the U.S., with a coalition of other countries, wages a new war on terror, ""Frontline"" investigates how ISIS  gained [so quickly] such a dangerous foothold...from the ashes of al-Qaeda.  [Frontline] uncovers the early warnings, the missteps, and the ancient tribal hatreds that fueled `the rise of ISIS.'""

The above comes from the beginning of this exceptional documentary.  This episode of the popular public affairs television program ""Frontline"" was broadcast on Oct. 28, 2014.

ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

(Iraq is a country of Western Asia.  Its capital is Baghdad.  Syria is also a country of Western Asia that borders Iraq to the East.  Its capital is Damascus.

Islam is a monotheistic, Abrahamic religion.  It is the second largest religion by number.  Isis was an ancient Egyptian goddess worshipped as an ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic.)

This film traces:

(1) How ISIS gained strength in Syria
(2) How they're funded
(3) How ISIS operates
(4) How they swept across Iraq (seizing territory, recording and broadcasting mass executions, and drawing recruits from other countries)

This documentary draws on comments from Iraqi politicians, American policymakers, and American military leaders.

The highlight of this program is the archival film footage.  Warning!!  Some of what's filmed is very graphic.  The archival material for this documentary comes from twenty sources including the Institute for the Study of War, Long War Journal, and the White House.

Finally, there are no extras but you can go to the PBS website for more information.

In conclusion, this is an informative, thought-provoking, and scary work of journalism by Frontline journalist Martin Smith (who also wrote and produced).  In my opinion, this documentary is required viewing for all that want to be adequately informed about the violent extremist group called ISIS.

(2014;  53 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  6 chapters;  Frontline;  PBS)
