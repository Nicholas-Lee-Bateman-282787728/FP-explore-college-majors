This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time. If you really want a great movie watch this I highly recommend this one.
I just did a review on another movie that was kind of older like this one & didn't like it at all. This movie is so good that I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a great thriller.

The ending was very strange & as I write this review I know this movie would stick in anyone's head for a long time after.
 You will think differently about mental asylums after you watch this for sure.

This was definitely the best movie I have seen in a long time. I like science fiction movies but this one was the bomb !
Surf no longer here is the one for you if you want a great thriller with real strange ending.",1363564800,,822,3.9696969696969697

There is always a degree of suspension of belief in any movie you watch , certain truths or facts that we as an audience are asked to ignore . But this movie is just dumb .

The premise that a nurse cant tell the difference between a job application , and a commitment form for a mental hospital , is just a bit too much , and sounds better as a plot for a dumb stoner comedy with Pauly Shore , as opposed to a drama . That she voluntarily committed herself , and for some reason cant un-commit herself is even more retarded .

The movie TRIES to build suspense , but it fails horribly

There is no real buildup to a climax , just a kinda coasting along  to the end that didn't come soon enough .

The acting isn't absolutely horrible , but its far from good , its just kinda mediocre , like you might see in a GOOD high school play .

Its supposed to be in a mental hospital , but the set very much seems like they rented someone's house in the northeast US , one of those large multi story houses with a few acres of land , A LOT bigger than most modern homes , but not quite a mansion . And to save money figured they would leave ALL the furnishings in place , and use a single line in the beginning scenes of the film to justify it , which they failed horribly at .

The only reason I left it on the channel is because I was waiting for the outer limits to come on after it and didn't want to miss it .

I say this as some one who wathes a lot of movies , and has over 700 movies on DVD : save your self the time , and just punch your self in the stomach a few times , its more entertaining than this cr@ppy movie !",1305590400,3,1707,3.865329512893983

7817992,5,6301955137,"I loved this movie. It's a decent mind twist; has a ""claustrophobic"" feel to it (look at things from the patient's point of view and you'll get it). And Jennifer O'Neill's ageless beauty is just the icing on the cake. The end was shockingly good and how ""Nurse Manning"" handles her escape was excellent. Her performance leaves you wondering is she or isn't she insane? I highly recommend it.",1465516800,,391,4.681159420289855
7817993,1,6301955137,"To say the least, this movie was boring and not really worth watching. You think you'll get a laugh out of it and... then... nothing. The twist at the end was simply formulaic at best and just plain pandering at worst. It's not even good for a weekend crapfest. It's not so bad it's good... or so good it's bad... this movie is just plain bad.

Do yourself a favor -- don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this!",1462665600,,415,4.1875
7817994,2,6301955137,"While a movie about a sane person who gets committed to a mental hospital sounds good and nightmarish, the movie itself falls flat.  The acting is awful and the characters are ridiculously unbelievable. At most, this is the type of movie that may get a following for being one of those so-bad-it's-good cult films.",1455580800,,314,4.814814814814815
