7750652,5,B01FKXO8S6,This show is a must for adventure fans and those who love to travel. It lets you escape into a world where there are still exciting artifacts to find hidden right beneath our noses. What little kid doesn't dream of finding a buried treasure? This show makes you feel like you found one every time you watch it.,1335052800,5,310,4.362068965517241
7750653,3,B01FKXO8S6,"Issues with disc packaging
1.  The packaging seems a bit lacking.  3 discs stacked on top of each other (with minor offsets) on both sides of the case.  I have many other series using slimline casing solutions and this is the worst I have seen so far.

Issues with the disc quality.
2.  I ordered the 3 season box set and after watching items from the first 3 discs of season 1 I found several bad areas on each disc that would skip / hesitate or skip to the next episode.  2 episodes were essentially non-viewable.  Please don't tell me it's an issue with my player as I have only seen his problem with one other disc (out of 100's).
Anyway I'm hoping it's just a single bad pressing and that a return with a swap for a new set will solve the playback problem.

As for the content.
If you are hyper-critical about action scenes / script quality you probably won't be happy.  Some of the action scenes are telegraphed and the scripts storyline are sometimes easily guessed in the first few minutes.

However, If you are looking for something that can take you away for a while and can accept it's fantasy you should be ok.  Personally, I like it as it takes me away for a while and it's not a reality or a judge (enter name) program.",1332633600,21,1233,4.294372294372295

7750664,5,B01FKXO8S6,Good series. People have complained of the video quality but I played it on three different DVD players and watched it on two HD tv's and did not find it all that bad. It was originally recorded in the format of the time and looks the same as it originally did. Let's put it this way I've seen much worse. Well worth it if you like these kinds of series.,1500854400,3,354,4.071428571428571

7750688,5,B01FKXO8S6,"When reviewing CD sets, I look at a few factors:  (1) Case Construction, (2) Interface, (3) play quality, (4) durability

CASE CONSTRUCTION
The cases on this three volume set are a bit odd ... on the one hand, they seem to open and close just fine, hold disks well, are easy to open, close, load and unload, and protect the DVD's from damage. On the other hand, the cases seem made of a plastic that is brittle and easily broken, and little bits of unimportant plastic always seem to be breaking off and falling out of the cases when I open then. This has done no harm to the disk and doesn't seem to effect the ability of the case to do its job, but finding bits of black plastic falling out of the case every time you open it is a bit disconcerting. Still, the breakage has been nothing more than a nuisance, so I'll give them 4 stars on the cases, with encouragement to improve.

INTERFACE/MENU
When I load these DVD's I access them using free VLC video player, and they seem to load up and play just fine. NO complaints at all. The main menu loads quickly, responds to all normal commands and gives access to all the episodes on the disk in an attractive and easy to use interface. I had an earlier edition (a ""best of"" Relic Hunter"") and I prefer the UI on this set much more than my older one. 5 Stars.

PLAY QUALITY
I have purchased DVD's from many sources over the years, and I have to say these are some of the highest quality I've seen in a while. The packaging says they are a product of Canada, and the quality has been very good. I've played through about half of the  66 episodes so far with NO playback issues ... quality is good, no skipping or errors. 100% satisfied so far. 5 stars.

DURABILITY
I've only had these for a few weeks, but so far, aside from the cases being a bit prone to bits coming off, the disks and sleeves seem top notch and are wearing well. That's what makes the case issue so weird. I've had DVD cases on other products that just fell apart and the disk was endangered as a result. This seems to be purely cosmetic breakage that doesn't harm either the disk or the protection provided by the case. So, other than that, durability thus far has been very good. Disks themselves are holding up perfectly.

So ... I'd give this set of 3 seasons a 4.8 out of 5 for great quality with only cosmetic issues with the cases. If you love Relic Hunter, I think you'll really love this set of disks.",1456444800,13,2427,4.26304347826087
7750689,2,B01FKXO8S6,"I like the show.  My star rating reflects only the released DVD set itself.  In a word, the video quality is bad.  I'm still on part of season 1, but so far it's worse than Mission Impossible from the '60s bad.  Light clothing and even some darker sort of sparkles and people's faces look like they have big blob freckles that move around.  Even on my upscaling DVD player, the quality is on par with VHS if not worse.  I'm not a videophile and used to watch real media compressed videos on a CRT monitor without complaints, but in this case the picture was actually distracting.  I was able to use some software on my computer to clean up a lot of the grain, but it could only do so much and there is still some sparkling effect which is annoying.  I found the box design to be completely acceptable and my computer has thus far detected no physical issues with any discs through mid-season 3.

I used to watch the series back when it was originally on.  I watched all of season one religiously, then one thing or another led to missing parts of the second season and I think the entire third one.  Recently I felt nostalgic and the complete series pack was less than I'd paid for FX The Series a year or two back, so I jumped on it.  Basically, think Tomb Raider with a sexy, smart, Asian Lara Croft, a fun British side-kick and a funny secretary back at the office and you have what this show is.  It's predictable.  It's stupid.  It's not intellectual.  It's also a heck of a lot of fun.

I don't want to scare you off it, because the show is still worth watching.  It's just that the picture quality was so disappointing to me I regret paying money for it.  If not for the video quality I'd easily give this set a 5 rating.  If the picture I uploaded stays attached to this review, then you'll see what I mean.  The pink curtain in the back for example has no spots, it's background static.  If you think you can handle it, definitely buy.",1449532800,19,1944,4.282967032967033

8761025,5,B01FKXO8S6,"Very enjoyable series which unfortunately lasted only three seasons.  I watched this show when it first came on TV but didn't catch all of seasons 1 & 2 episodes and don't remember seeing any of season 3.  I liked it back then and have just finished viewing all three seasons of this DVD set.  Unlike several reviewers who complained of poor quality, my set had excellent video and audio quality for every episode.  Maybe their DVDs were bad or mine are especially good, or maybe the manufacturer improved their product.

This nearly twenty year old series has a good blend of action and humor, and unlike many more recent TV shows, has 20+ episodes per season instead of 10-12 so the buyer gets a good deal for their bucks.  The Sydney and Nigel characters were perfectly cast and interacted very well with each other and were quite likable.  The ditsy Claudia character was finely played by Lindy Booth who was the perfect dumb blonde, but she only lasted the first two seasons (and met a terrible fate in WRONG TURN).  Her successor, the Karen character was the opposite, a smart and very clever blonde who played Sydney's secretary in season 3.

Butt kicking Sydney Fox and wimpy sidekick Nigel Bailey travel all over the world searching for various artifacts and encountering a wide variety of mythological and legendary beings along with many evil doers and shady characters wanting those objects for their own nefarious purposes.  The writers of this show are very imaginative, turning out numerous excellent stories and plots with a fine balance of drama, mystery, and action.  Season 3 ended with in somewhat of a cliffhanger, so I assume the producers were hoping for another year of work which unfortunately never happened.

As described on the back of the DVD case, this series is a combination of INDIANA JONES and TOMB RAIDER and folks who enjoyed this show should check out the NATIONAL TREASURE movies, SAHARA, and THE LAST TEMPLAR too.",1528416000,,1952,4.828828828828829
