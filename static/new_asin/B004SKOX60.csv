8439909,4,B004SKOX60,"Incite Mill a Japanese movie with English subtitles, is like a merger of Survivor, Big Brother and Cluedo, with some props such as ten indian statues, one that talks,around the compound giving a nice visual tribute and reminder that they are likely to die to contestants of Agatha Chrisitie's And Then There Were None. Basically mostly young Japanese (and an old man and woman) are successful in applying to a mysterious job advertisement that pays a ridiculously high amount of money.  They have no idea what the job is, only knowing it's an experiment. They are taken in luxury stretched limos to an isolated building in the middle of nowhere. Before commencing they are warned that the experiment will ask them to break morality and mortality rules and they don't have to accept the positions.  All of course decide the money is too appealing and excitingly walk down a staircase taking them deep underground. Once at the bottom the thick concrete doors bang shut.  At first it seems like a regular Big Brother type show, there's a dining room, games room and each have a bedroom.  However they are told they are not allowed in anyone else's room after ten o'clock. Doors however can't be locked.  A floating giant metal robot will lethally enforce this rule.  Inside each room everyone has a weapon that only they can access with their key card. Cluedo style, there's a gun, fireplace poker, ice pick, cyanide pill, crossbow and a variety of things.  No one knows what anyone else has been allocated, although they can ask.  They can murder each other if they choose. Corpses and killers get double pay each time.  If you accuse someone of the crime and the majority of other housemates agree with you, you as a detective also get double pay.  The accused also gets a bonus wage and is taken by Guard (the robot) and locked in a cell.  After 7 days or if only two people remain alive, the door opens and you can leave with your wages.

It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's fun for this type of survival movie with a bit of what would you do in this situation thrown in.  There a few things that didn't make a great deal of sense to me or needed explaining a bit more.  Spoilers obviously - if this is a reoccurring show with heaps of viewers how come these job applicants had never heard of it.  The movie would probably have made more sense if this was the first season of that show, or if the contestants were aware and some had come with a plan.  Perhaps instead of applying to a job they could have been kidnapped and awoken in the room.  If past winners had gotten the money then they still would have been financially motivated.  If you were accused of being a killer and locked in the cell, isn't this the best thing.  You are locked away and safe from being murdered by the others and you got the bonus pay for being convicted by the others.  Wouldn't it have made sense for the doctor to accuse his girlfriend, or the other contestants who cared for one of the others to accuse that person so they'd be locked away safe and both of you get more money?
