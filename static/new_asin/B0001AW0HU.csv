1985577,5,B0001AW0HU,"Someone said eirlier that it sucks that they've made this a PG-13 deal, but it's still looks like it's gonna be as good as, if not better than, the first.  And i know it'll be better than the second.  As for what needs to be taken out, yes there'll be less raunchy sex jokes and nudity, but don't forget that most of the nudity in the last two films, was male nudity.  So don't get too stressed about that fact that they're toning it down.",1066608000,,439,4.141176470588236

1985629,3,B0001AW0HU,"Hilarious in parts especially Cindy as a mother that was priceless.

But in the end unfortunately this movie tanked its potential with lame humor badly timed jokes and the end ?

Omg that end was horrible the alien thing and all that other crap wasn't the least bit funny in any capacity.

So some hilarious parts but unfortunately too many moments where the jokes fall with a deafening thud and cant recuperate afterwards.

Its a shame that I found this one so funny the first time I watched it.

But another viewing showed me just how bad this entry into the franchise actually was.",1426118400,,584,4.576923076923077

1985641,3,B0001AW0HU,"For such a low brow film, it has surprisingly good acting and directing.  The writing isn't stellar, but then that's to be expected from a spoof that relies mainly on revising lines and situations from other movies. It's kind of like ""sampling"" in the music business--using what others have already come up with. However, there are some undeniably hilarious moments, though, admittedly, most of them are very low brow, blue collar type humor.  Perhaps the best line is the spoof on The Ring, where Anna Faris' character is called to warn her of her death in seven days, and she says ""Wait....7 days?  Does that include holidays?""  ""It depends. What holiday?""  ""Martin Luther King Day.""  ""Then, no.""  ""Why not? Everybody's getting it off!""  That's one of the few clean funny lines.  But...  if you like low class, raunchy humor, you will likely love this.",1425945600,,854,4.868055555555555

1985833,5,B0001AW0HU,This was just a great funny movie all the way around. The laughs were continuously around every corner. But not for  ages 12 or under due to some adult content and language.,1402185600,,173,4.40625

1985835,2,B0001AW0HU,It follows the basic plot of every other of the Scary Movie series and spoofs a variety of recent horror movies which have been in the public domain. It is more of the same sophomoric humor and slapstick gags and becomes quite a bore very quickly.,1401840000,,247,4.391304347826087

1985845,4,B0001AW0HU,"If you are a fan of the Scary Movie franchise and movies in this same vein you will not be disappointed in this 3rd outing. You have to realize they spoof movies that are popular at the time each Scary Movie is produced but they are mainstream enough that you can understand the humor whenever you watch each offering.  Of course the many actors and musicians that lend thier talents are in no short suppliy.  Several familiar main charactors are here along with many recognizable entertainers that show up throughout the film.

No real slow spots in the film.  They keep the funny stuff rolling at a good pace.  If you like to laugh, enough the spoof-type of humor, and enjoy seeing a varied group of entertainers frequently out of thier element then you will enjoy Scary Movie 3.  Clear your mind of your daily worries, escape for awhile in some slapstick style humor, enjoy.  You won't be sorry.",1399852800,,898,4.610062893081761

1985869,3,B0001AW0HU,"This is a truly funny, enjoyably ridiculous parody of several horror films with an attractive, entertaining cast who play the ridiculous material just right. It has a hit or miss slapstick approach sort of like the Laugh-In TV show from back in the sixties. This is a fun movie if you are in the mood for some cheap laughs and some good-natured insanity. Remember, this is not ""Gone with the Wind"", just a light-hearted Hollywood satire. Young people especially will appreciate much of the intentionally silly humor.",1398211200,,516,4.942528735632184

Suddenly it came to me as I read point seven which said, ""Stay away from stupid movies, like Scary Movie 3.

This movie was crafted for young men who are still living in the basement. Anytime the movie starts with two buxom young girls pillow fighting you know the film is in trouble.  By the way the buxom was.not real, need better make up artists to shade in fake breasts.

If you follow my ratings I give the movies from one to five bags of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn. Scary Movie rates the old maid kernels in the bottom of the bag. Move on, nothing happening here.",1397088000,,795,4.14935064935065

Nielsen is one of my favorite comedic actors since childhood. seven years later, I still love this movie. It's my 2nd favorite behind the original. Anna Faris and Regina Hall return as Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks. Cindy is now a news reporter and investigates the crop circles that have appeared in farmers Tom  and George Logan's cornfield. Tom is the serious brother to George. George is the wanna-be rap artist who begins to fall in love with Cindy. When Cindy finds an evil videotape, she has 7 days to live unless she can destroy Tabitha, the evil girl who possesses the tape.

1985954,4,B0001AW0HU,"For those who aren't acquainted with the SCARY MOVIE series, make a point of looking up the first two and watching them before seeing this one. It won't make this one clearer but you will get an idea of what to expect.

Begun by the Wayans brothers, the series of films spoofs the resent upsurge of horror films filling your local multiplex. This time around the Wayans have moved on. But in their place is one of the creators of this subgenre of film, David Zucker. Along with his brother and Jim Abrahams, they took the spoof format a whole new direction wherein every statement uttered by a character could and would be taken the wrong way. Beginning with KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and then moving on to AIRPLANE! and the NAKED GUN series of films, they have made some of the funniest films around. And this one falls in line with the rest.

So okay, what do you need to know before seeing this one? Make sure that you watch THE RING, SIGNS, EIGHT MILE, MATRIX RELOADED and THE OTHERS before seeing this film. If you don't you'll miss many of the jokes going on here. Along with many other sight gags, these are the main films focused on for attack. And if you haven't seen those films, stop here until you do because while talking about this one you'll find spoilers for those.

The film revolves around Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), two characters to carry on through all three films. Now working as a television news reporter, she investigates a strange crop circle that has appeared in a local field. Through this investigation she meets George (Simon Rex), the brother of the farm owner Tom (Charlie Sheen) and a love interest is sparked.

The strange goings on at the farm form one portion of the plot. The second flows around a video tape that once viewed results in an immediate phone call stating that you will die in 7 days. Cindy has watched this tape and is seeking a way to prevent this from happening. And somewhere along the line, the two stories converge.

Okay, this sounds so serious how can there be anything funny about the two stories or the things that happen to the people involved? Easy. The movie pokes fun with scenes nearly lifted from the original movies. One seen in the previews has Tom finding a white dressed figure in his daughter's bedroom ala THE OTHERS. When he questions who it is, the figure claims to be his daughter. When he lifts her veil, it turns out to be none other than Michael Jackson, who claims he didn't do anything to Tom's daughter because she's a girl.

To describe more scenes in this movie in an effort to explain where the humor comes from would result in nothing more than ruining the jokes found throughout. Face it, once you know the punch line the joke just isn't as funny. I recall seeing BLAZING SADDLES long after its initial release. The scene with the horse being punched out that so many had told me was funny offered no laughs at all for me. So if you want to know more from this one too bad. Go see it.

So what did I think of the movie now that I've gone on and on about what to expect? I thought it was one of the funniest films I've seen all year. Some of the moments were crude or pain inducing for a character, but they each were so overboard that they could inspire nothing but laughter (i.e. a kid who seems to get hurt from beginning to end).

This is a definite popcorn flick, one that requires the viewer to not become so involved that he has to study each frame of film. It's one that is meant for the viewer to sit back and guffaw at from the first segment (involving stereotypical blonde bimbos Pamela Anderson Lee and Jenny McCarthy spoofing not only THE RING but themselves as well) to the last.

While I've read a few reviews that have lambasted this film calling it stupid and little more than brain candy all I can say is hey...what did you expect? That is exactly what this movie is and more power to it! Amid the serious disease of the week films, the social crusade films, the pure message films, the blood and guts films, there needs to be something to cleanse the palette and just enjoy without thinking. If that's what you need this week, then make a point of seeing this one. You'll get the laughs you're looking for.",1205539200,,4207,4.425064599483204
1985955,2,B0001AW0HU,"I was enjoying it quite a bit for the first 30 minutes or so.  The two busty  supermodels who open the movie catch your attention real fast.  And the jokes are good.  The 8-Mile rap showdown (use the subtitles on this part to catch it all) and the kindergarten teacher who tries to scare her friend a few times before getting it for real were funny scenes too.

But as it got deeper into the whole ""Signs/The Ring"" parody, I started losing interest.  Maybe 'cause I didn't much care for either of those movies, especially ""Signs"".. The Ring was ripe for parody and it was coming off well in the beginning, but got tiresome along with the rest of it very quickly.  The jokes just kept getting flatter and flatter as the movie went on.  Leslie Neilson as the president didn't do ANYTHING to help things (quite the contrary - talk about stupid - he was bringing this one down!).  And yeah like someone else mentioned - all the kid violence was a bit much and I didn't like the Mother Theresa gags (shooting a hole in a picture of Mother Theresa is funny?)

I love the quirky dialogue, making fun of enimem and writing rap lyrics. The plot is not as thin as one would believe with sequells and I love the scene with the baby sitting catholic priest, bringing wine and lighting candles.

Probably the best scene of the movie is right after the main character wins a rap contest and winds up getting thrown out of the club when he pulls his white sweatshirt hood on in a manner which makes him look like a member of a white supremacist group. There are also a lot of really good gags involving the little boy in the movie. He keeps getting run over and hit in various ways... sort of like Kenny from South Park.

i found myself constantly laughing during this movie

My favorate parts were 1) the brenda samara fight, i was actually laughing too hard the first few times i saw it, that i had to rewind because i kept missing it because i was laughing so hard, and 2) the oracle part.  Queen latifa does a great job as the oracle.

1985974,1,B0001AW0HU,"I rarely give a movie anything less than a perfect score because I love movies; however, this movie was lacking in suspense and in the scariness factor even though it is supposed to be a parody, it still could have been a little more scarier and suspenseful, instead, you spend most of your time between laughing and then, getting bored by the inane plot.

This movie only deserves 1 star because while it's funny in many of the scenes (the quotes are hysterical), the actual plot was rather dry, and boring.

The only thing that kept the movie from wanting you to throw your popcorn at your tv or movie screen is the simple fact that the dialogue was unbelievably humorous.

The actors and actresses did a great job of acting, in some cases, overacting, but despite it's parodical merit, I only give this film 1-stars because without the humorous dialogue, the plot itself ruins the movie and makes it so stale that ""not even the best popcorn can save this movie.""

1985977,2,B0001AW0HU,"Movie parodies fall into two general categories. The ones in the first category are funny enough to transcend parody; you don't need to be familiar with the original source films to enjoy BLAZING SADDLES, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, or AIRPLANE! The ones in the second category, however, are so dependent on your knowledge of key sequences or lines of dialogue that the gags are bound to fall flat if you haven't seen the movies they're spoofing. SCARY MOVIE 3, directed by David Zucker, a founding father of movie parodies (AIRPLANE! and the NAKED GUN series) is a prime example of the second category, as its aggressive, machine-gun delivery takes potshots at several targets, primarily SIGNS, THE RING, THE MATRIX RELOADED, and even 8 MILE. If you haven't seen any of these films, you're pretty much out of luck; it's like being in a room full of people who are reminiscing about a party you didn't attend. Then again, even if you understand the jokes it doesn't mean you'll be laughing at them. While the cast gamely struggles to sell every gag (and sometimes succeeding) the loose, anti-plot structure is eventually what sinks these types of films.

This was a decent movie, better than its predecessor Scary Movie 2, but still neither can compare to the original. SC3 wasn't even written or directed by any of the Wayans brothers, as they had retired from Scary Movie after the release of the second one. David Zucker, veteran director of Airplane and Naked Gun Movies, took over and cast Leslie Nielsen as President Harris. Adding to the cast, comedian George Carlin as ""The Architect"", Queen Latifah as ""The Oracle"", Charlie Sheen as Tom Logan, Simon Rex as George Logan, Denise Richards as Annie Logan, Anthony Anderson as Mahalik, Eddie Griffin as Orpheus, Camryn Manheim as Trooper Champlin, Ja Rule as Agent Thompson, D.L. Hughley as John Wilson, and Darrell Hammond as Father Muldoon.

With cameos by Simon Cowell, Fat Joe, Master P, Macy Gray, Method Man, Redman, RZA, U-God, and Raekwon. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson also make an appearance in the beginning as Kate and Becca. Also actor Edward Moss imitates the King of Pop perfectly. MJ himself did not think it to funny as he sued Dimension for damages after the movie was released in theaters.

We return with Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris), who is now a reporter for WDCN, who is following up a story on crop circles on Tom Logan's (Sheen) farm. After a night out with her friend Brenda (Regina Hall), she tells Cindy about a videotape she watched a week ago, a videotape where whoever watches it dies seven days after its viewing. After Brenda's death, Cindy visits a telepathic woman called ""The Oracle"" that tells her there is a link between the crop circles and the videotape. Now since Cindy has viewed the tape herself, she has seven days to find the link between the tape and the crop circles and find a way to stop it before her time is up.

The side stories in the movie that really have no bearing on the story line is George's (Rex) rap career, the death of Annie (Richards), how Cody (Drew Mikuska) came to be with Cindy, etc. The jokes in this movie are funny, but are not on the same scale of humor as the Wayans brothers had done with sex jokes, flatulence, drugs, etc. The actors do an excellent job, especially Leslie Nielsen; the film could not have worked without him.

1985983,3,B0001AW0HU,"""Scary Movie 3"" is a disjointed parody of many recent horror films, and principally stars Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen, and the lovely Anna Faris. The film is inconsistent and suffers from some overused gags, but does have some genuinely entertaining moments, my favorite of which is the great visual gag of the ""crop circle"" on Charlie Sheen's farm.

One central problem with the film is that it attempts to work too many gags from too many sources into a single (short) movie. Many of the gags are funny (Leslie Nielsen's reprise of his ""I just want to tell you both good luck"" line from ""Airplane"" comes to mind), but many others are overdone and grow tiresome (I am thinking of the fisticuffs in the White House here). I will say without qualification that the rapping subplot parody gets very old, very fast.

The actual killer videotape is fairly entertaining to watch along with the ""terrified"" cast members, and some of the pop culture skewers are pretty good (I am thinking of the Michael Jackson piece, although it hits a bit close to home after Jackson's recent trial), but much of the slapstick falls short; this is especially true with the aliens in the cornfield.

This is pure mindless entertainment, and is utterly forgettable in every way. Having said that, it does deliver a few good laughs, but it is uneven in execution. I hesitantly recommend it to people who want to laugh at something silly. If you approach it from that angle, you will be getting what you expect, and what the producers wanted to deliver.",1121817600,7,1530,4.7443609022556394

1985997,3,B0001AW0HU,"The third entry in Dimention Film's hit series looks more like belated 'Naked Gun 4' with its director David Zucker and co-writer Pat Frost.  They assembled for the film many parodies and throw them to us like a ball -- they do it with hit-or-miss (often a big miss) approach, with many actors like Charlie Sheen and Anna Faris.  The results are better than the second one, but still remind us that to keep on doing silly things needs more energy than we think.  In other words, the film is funny at times, but you have to wait pretty much for the laughs to come.

The story is mainly based on three films -- 'The Ring' 'Signs' and '8 Miles.'  During the short running time you see many spoofs (some include a very unkind portrayal of one pop singer) that are done in the 'Hot Shots' style.  This time they even created the 'battle' of hip-hop singers, with a MC Anthony Anderson.

Besides Sheen, Faris, and Anderson, the following faces appear -- Simon Rex, Pamela Anderson, Jeremy Piven, Regina Hall, Queen Latifah (parodying 'Matrix Reloaded'), Eddie Griffin, Denise Richards (as Sheen's wife, as in real life), and who else? Leslie Nielsen.  You can also see a glimpse of singers like Master P and JA Rule.  (Sorry I'm not a hip-hop fan, so I just couldn't recognize others.)

The film is often silly, but not everything succeeds, because some gags look repetitious (how many times do these characters have to slip and fall?).  I like seeing silly gags on screen, but not if they start to look a little predictable after the repetition.  New materials are introduced, but the way the film makes fun of them remains the same as in 'The Nake Gun' series.

Still I find some (not many) very funny, and it's always welcome to see lovely Anna Faris doing comical things.  She is one of the few actresses who can be both silly and charming, though we know that she (and Charlie Sheen perhaps) deserves much better materials than this one.",1102723200,,1936,4.590116279069767

1985999,3,B0001AW0HU,"""Scary Movie 3"" offers yet more hit-and-miss comedy in the ""Airplane/Naked Gun/Hot Shots"" vein of movie parody.  As with the previous two films in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, the writers of this film look towards recent popular horror movies to serve as the basis for both their jokes and their storyline.  In this case, the plot is a cross between ""The Ring"" and ""Signs,"" with a few glancing blows aimed at ""The Others,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" and, of all things, ""8 Mile,"" along the way.

Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielson are probably the most recognizable faces in the movie, both being veterans of earlier ""Airplane,"" ""Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"" films.  As with most films of this type, some of the jokes in ""Scary Movie 3"" work and some do not, but those that do are often quite ingenious and make the movie as a whole worth seeing.  The crudity that marred the previous films in the franchise has been almost completely eliminated here.  Some people may find that a loss while others may find it a gain.  Frankly, I prefer the gentler, more innocent tone in this edition.

""Scary Movie 3"" isn't any great shakes as a comedy, and chances are you won't remember a thing about it even five minutes after you've seen it, but it will make you laugh quite a bit for the 80 or so minutes that you're watching it.

1986001,3,B0001AW0HU,"The third entry in the ""Scary Movie"" series moves away from its grossout origin and takes on the slapstick method showcased in films like ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"". The reason why is simple. The Wayans Brothers are out on this installment and ""Naked Gun"" director David Zucker is onboard. While fans of the first two's sadistic shock value driven humor may be turned off by this more by-the-numbers movie spoof, there are still some laughs to be found here.

""Scary Movie 3"" takes aim at everything from ""Signs"" and ""The Ring"" to non-horror blockbusters like ""8 Mile"". The story revolves around female newscaster, Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris as one of the few returning characters) who is trying to get to the bottom of a mysterious occurance involving crop circles and a ""killer video tape"". Thrown in the mix are a faithless former priest, his wannabe rapper brother, and a who's who of talented stars in cameo roles. The ""story"" is more or less a bunch of gags built around the more recent popular movies but for the most part, everything works well enough to entertain.

While not quite what everyone might have been looking for, the third ""Scary Movie"" has its moments. The opening ""Ring"" parody with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy makes for an amusing opening while scenes involving Leslie Nielsen as the slow-minded commander-in-chief show that the ""Naked Gun"" star hasn't lost a step in the tounge-in-cheek department. While it sticks to the usual formula,  ""Scary Movie 3"" is a fun little movie that delivers with more than a few laughs.",1096675200,2,1556,4.8641509433962264
1986002,5,B0001AW0HU,"The funniest movie of the year of the sequel. I remember seeing the preview for it. I saw that it was co-written by Par Proft and it was directed by one of my personal favourite directors: David Zucker. Well, actually at the time I didn't know who David Zucker was. I didn't know who Jerry Zucker was, Pat Proft or Jim Abrahams either. But after seeing this I rented Naked Gun and Airplane! I soon fell in love with their hilarious visual gag-a-minute style.

This movie got a bad reputation. It must be hard to try and live up to The Z-A-Z classics like Airplane! and Top Secret! But it was still a very freakin' hillarious film that is to underrated and hated by to many people. Obviously people with no sense of humour! It wasn't as good as the first one but it was much better than the second (which wasn't terrible by the way). So if you're looking for a good laugh, you might want to try renting Airplane! and Top Secret! first but after that, I command you to rent this! Although I didn't like the 8 Mile spoof (the rap battle part anyway) because it was just a bunch of rapping. And David Zucker must have needed some help because during the special features on the DVD (I own it, oh yeah) someone said that he hadn't been out of the house in twenty years so he didn't know anything about the pop culture he was spoofing.

1986003,4,B0001AW0HU,"Beware: This motion picture is not for vindictive journalists, Catholics, aspiring rappers, Mother Teresa partisans or pop-culture icons with deteriorating nasal cavities.

""Scary Movie 3: Episode I - Lord of the Brooms"" is a hysterical riot. Granted, it is not ""Airplane"" or the original ""Naked Gun,"" but director David Zucker has fashioned a surefire belly laugh nonetheless.

Although I can see why some spurn the latest ""Scary Movie"" as too slapstick, too preposterous and too satirical - thrusting tasteless pokes at the likes of Eminem and Catholic priests - I believe the film quenches the movie-goer's parched lips with a pungent brew of ha-ha.

If it's not Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy acting as ditsy as a doped-up Anna Nicole -by the way, the film provides satisfactory grounds as to how Anderson's breasts became so reduced in size (it involves radio waves) - it's Leslie Nielson depicting a hip-hop commander in chief with a cabinet composed solely of African-Americans.

Queen Latifah and Eddie Griffin are ridiculous as the oracle and Orpheus, though, to my disappointment, the sequence about ""prophesizing"" seen in the teaser was left out of the picture.

The movie even goes so far as to rat out broadcast networks as pervert-run enterprises that pursue ""strip club expos&eacute;s"" in lieu of relevant news.

One scene guaranteed to twang the funny bone involves amateur footage of alien beings seen hastily trudging to the tune of grotesque foreground imagery.

Yet another scene, the one that threw yours truly into a fit of guffaw quiver, was the unveiling of director Zucker's version of the creepy tape from ""The Ring."" The scene involves a fat grump and a revolving upside-down chair.

The third chapter of ""Scary Movie"" is one of those films that doesn't necessarily sustain a fixed grin on the visage of the audience member through subtle idiocy.

Rather, it is a viewing experience that slings chuckle by the bucketful. In other words, the film will purposely tone down its hoot frenzy only to rupture with outlandish hilarity.

Truthfully speaking, there were moments during the film I found myself busting up so feverishly that I narrowly sidestepped aneurysms. Heck, a teary residue from the laugh-out-loud-ness of it all still predominates my cheeks.

The only complaint I have is the adhere-to-the-script usage of George Carlin as the architect. Let the senile fart improvise a little.

The celebrity cameos also make this film better than its predecessors.  Macy Gray, Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Leslie Nielsen, Queen Latifah, George Carlin, Charlie Sheen, Denise Richards, Camryn Manheim (The Practice), and Eddie Griffin as Orpheus.  You can't beat Eddie Griffin as Orpheus, married to Queen Latifah the Oracle.

One of the funniest performances is turned in by Regina Hall.  Her facial expressions and lines are easily the best in the film.  Anna Faris does a good job as Cindy Campbell, playing the dual role of the Naomi Watts and Britney Murphy characters in The Ring and Eight Mile.  Faris is suitably annoying to play those characters.

I figured it out. {And because I heard George Carlin and Queen Latifah are in it}. This is a  good movie, but it is silly. The people who made all 3 scary movies have taken ideas from other scary movies, but in their own way, made them different. You might not regret seeing Scary Movie 3.",1091404800,,385,4.133333333333334
1986014,2,B0001AW0HU,"Well, not exactly a zero. I admit, the crude, and often, sexual, humor of the Wayan Brothers always brings a laugh out of me. But unfortunately for the third movie of the ""Scary Movie"" series, this one is by far, the worst. As with most movies and series, the quality just keeps going down... and ""Scary Movie 3"" is not an exception.
""Scary Movie 3"" uses ""The Ring"" and ""Signs"" as the main themes of the third installment. The beginning of the movie is exactly like the beginning of ""The Ring"" with Pamela Lee Anderson and Jenny McCarthy. It was pretty hilarious to watch, as also what the Scary Movies do is point out questionable and often, stupid, aspects of the movies that they are portraying.
Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex are two of the main characters in this movie, with the theme of ""Signs"". Sheen is an ex-priest living on a farm with his wanna-be rapper brother, Rex. Faris returns as the leading character in the film, as a news reporter. She represents Naomi Watts' character in ""The Ring"" who is a newspaper reporter trying to find out about the mystery of the videotape. Regina Hall also re-appears as Faris' good friend, who is now a teacher. There are cameos by Queen Latifah, George Carlin, Eddie Griffin, Denise Richards, and Leslie Nielson (Gun 1 1/2), are some of the actors/actresses that appear in the movie.
With ideas from ""The Sixth Sense"", Faris' nephew has an extrasensory sense that gives him the ability to see and know things that other people do not. Also, there is a part of the movie that uses ""The Others"". Rex's character portrays Eminem in ""8 Mile"", with a MC battle scene. It also uses ideas from ""The Matrix Reloaded"", with Queen Latifah as the Oracle and Eddie Griffin as Morpheus.
Faris' character begins investigating the mystery of the crop circles that appear in Sheen's field, and she discovers a mysterious tape that ""kills"" people. The story unfolds, character's stories are told, and aliens land on earth...
The movie had its funny parts, but most of it was corny and typical as they come, much like stale popcorn you get at the theatre. Most of the crude, sexual humor that made ""Scary Movie"" so popular is not there as much and neither is the signature ""release"" scene, which I was looking forward to but got disappointed when I found out there was no such scene in this one.
My advice would have been to keep it the crude, sexual humor that made the two predecessors so popular, and keep away from the corniness. Keenan Ivory Wayans apparently rushed the filming of this movie, wanting to complete it as soon as possible. It shows, very strongly, in the movie. Instead of making it even funnier, all they added was more cameos or eye candy, to keep the audience entertained. I'm sorry, but I did not take it.
I didn't bother to watch any extras but the alternate ending. It was a good thing that they didn't use this as the real ending, it was twice as corny. Rex turns into the Hulk, and Faris goes into the Matrix...
For any Scary Movie fans, it's something to watch, it's entertaining enough. But if you haven't watched any Scary Movies yet, I would recommend watching the movie in order. It also helps to make sense between the first and second one. I also noticed that there is no connection between the first two movies and the third one, except the return of Faris's and Hall's characters.",1089072000,2,3346,4.596989966555184

1986016,3,B0001AW0HU,"Scary Movie 3 is, obviously the third installment in the comedy/horror spoof series which skewers recent horror movies.  In the third installment which stars Leslie Nielsen and Charlie Sheen, the targets of the jokes are ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", ""The Ring"", the matrix, ""The Others"" and ""Darkness Falls"".
The heavy targets are ""signs"" and ""The Ring"" with Charlie Sheen taking over the Mel Gibson role as the former minister.  Leslie Nielsen plays the President in typical Airplane-esque fashion.
The jokes come rapid fire and there are a lot of sight gags and inside jokes that you might not get unless you saw the above movies.
Scary Movie 3 is a bit toned down than the first two movies and gets a PG13 rating for language and sexual content.  Nothing too strong though.  The opening sequence with former Playboy Playmates Pam Anderson & Jenny McArthy playing out the opening sequence from ""The Ring"" in dumb blonde fashion complete with their enhanced breasts in bras is a classic.
No classic, but good fun and several laugh out loud funny scenes.",1088380800,,1053,4.898876404494382

I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised!  It seems the departure of the Wayans brothers from this franchise has revitalised it.
This film takes off movies such as Signs, 8mile, the Matrix, The Ring, The Others and more in the way Naked Gun and Airplane spoofed their respective movies.  This is because one of the Zucker brothers directed this, and whilst its knowwhere near as good as his previous films, it's a huge improvement on Scary Movie 1 & 2.  (How did they get away with the Michael Jackson spoof?  Close to the knuckle and very funny!)
The extras are excellent, in particular the alternative ending, which is very interesting to watch (though thank God they went with the final cut, as the alternative simply isn't funny - but its completely different  - spoofing the Hulk).
A fun film, with adequate performances and excellent extras.",1087776000,,966,4.7604790419161676

For me, the funniest part of the movie was the rap contest. We were just laughing the whole way through it.
I don't know if anyone caught the reference to the mid-90's cop drama ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"", particularly the Subway episode. It was when Denise Richards was pinned between the truck and the tree.

""Okay, in this scene, the girl jumps up in the air and freezes--just like in THE MATRIX.""
That's pretty much the pattern of humor for that whole movie: make endless references to other (better) movies.  No real jokes, just references.
I saw SCARY MOVIE 3 only because I noticed that some of the writers and director had been involved in the NAKED GUN films.  I laughed a couple times, but a lot of this felt like the first film (I never bothered to see the second).  I really wished they would've left Michael Jackson out of the preview because that scene could've provided one of the bigger laughs--if I hadn't already saw it fifty times in the commercial.
I could understand fusing THE RING and SIGNS, but tossing in the Eminem movie parody felt meandering and knocked the movie off-balance--especially since it had nothing to do with the second half of the film.",1087603200,2,944,4.640718562874252
1986022,4,B0001AW0HU,"Well, as always, Scary movie 3 isn't as funny as part 1; they never are, But it is certinly better then part 2! And is still one of the best comedy's made for a while of it's nature!
This time around, the Wayans brothers have moved away, and Robert K. Weiss, Craig Mazin & Pat Proft and producer David Zucker have taken over. David Zucker also brought us the great parody films ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", ""Naked Gun's"" ""Airplane/(Flying HIgh), ""hot shot's"" ect... Which is the producer youd probably most want to take over in the parody feild of film making.
This movie is pretty much a parody of a tied combination of ""The Ring"" and ""Signs"", ""The Ring"" in parts has been parodyd very well and hillariously! I wasn't so impressed with ""Signs"" tho. Also there are small parody's to ""The Matrix"", ""8 Mile"", ""The Others"", ""American Idol"" and various others... also a parody to ""The Hulk"" and more ""Matrix"" if you watch the alterenite ending!
I thought the movie had a bit of a slow start, the opening scene with Pamala Anderson and Jenny McArthy I thought was pretty stupid, tho i'm sure alot of guys would like to see them in next to nothing on the screen at the same time; not me, but it is good that Pamala has a sense of humour about a certin video she was in!!!! Then moving on into the returning Anna Farris as Cindy Cambell, who is now an anchor women at a TV station, who is in the care of her nefue or somthing? And she basicly falls victom to the RING type of events. The only other returning actor I think is Rigina Hall as Brenda, and she has one hell of a funny funeral! Tho I read that it distrubed some veiwers, my sympothy goes out to you, but i thought it was one of the funniest things in the film! Also bringing in Zucker fav's Leslie Neilson and Charlie Sheen to come on board and help out with the movie helped a bit. It is good to see Leslie back in the saddle of the parody genre. His performence isn't all super funny, but still it's good to see him back where he belongs. Also a pretty large amount of cameo's by alot actors, comedians, rappers ect.. all in all, the movie isn't as funny as part 1, but alot better then part 2! Tho I thought the first 10 minute's where pretty stupid, it did get better, the ending was decent enough to leave me thinking that the movie was worth getting on DVD when it came out to complete the collection! I must add tho, Some of the jokes I could see coming from a mile away, I knew they where going to happen before they did, either it's because it's so obvious? or i'm too familuer with Zucker's comic concept's? Oh, somthing I don't know if any one picked up on, but i think quite funny is this movie also introduces an actor Simon Rex to a leading man in this film. I don't know if it was intentional, or not because I don't have audio commentary to find out of it got mentioned, but Simon was in a film called ""Shriek: If you know what I did last Friday the 13th"" which was a parody of ""Scary Movie 1""! It just seem's funny to me that he would be in a movie parody playing to a movie's seaqull he would end up doing a few years later! HAHAHA
The bonus features are ok, there delted/alternate scenes, showing some really weird stuff, and some funny stuff that I thought they should have left in the movie, with parodys to ""The Hulk"" and even the guy from the ""Sub-Way"" commercials! Then there's a pretty dull out-take reel, and some featurettes... suprising tho, there isn't a trailer!!! I don't think there's any eggs either :( but overall, if you like Zucker films in the past, then you will probably like SM3.
I'd give a reveiw on the Audio Commentary: But I didn't get to hear it :( on the Australian (regioun 4) release, the track that is supposed to have the audio commentary has Italian audio there instead. They have made a boo boo there!!! Track 2 and 4 are both the same Italian audio. Beware of that any one buying Australian (Regioun 4) versions if you actually care to listen to the commentary?! cause it's not there!
But if you like the more R rated styles of the Wayans brothers, then you may not like it, it has been tonned down alot to make it a PG rated movie. Tho there still are it's amounts of swearing, Rent it before you buy, i'd recomend you do that if your interested in the film, there's too many mixed opinions to say buy or don't buy, just rent it to make up your own mind if youd wanna own it or not?",1087171200,,4386,4.253892215568862

George and Cindy (this news reporter on TV) they get married at the end and Cindy's boy Cody gets tortured throughout the whole movie, it's not even funny!

A good cast cannot unfortunately save a lame script, and suprisingly bad direction from Mr Zucker et al, whose other films in the past have been much funnier, and much more watchable. Leslie Nielsen has a cameo as the President and Charlie Sheen plays Mel Gibson's character from the ""Signs"" movie, but even their comic pedigree are wasted, which is a shame. Old ideas and jokes are run through the mill to try and get some cheap laughs, and I get the feeling that even the younger generation are getting tired of sexual innuendo, and corny sight gags when they aren't supported by a reasonable story as is the case here.

His track record with Airplane, Top Secret and the Naked Gun series gave me hope that their would finally be another funny movie in this genre.  Scary Movie 3 had funny moments, but definitely failed to deliver.
The main problem is the set up of the movie and the belief that that you almost have to remake a movie to make it funny.  So, Scary Movie 3 is a combination of Signs, The Ring and Eight Mile.  Almost every scene in the film is a direct ripoff from one of these movies.  So, if you haven't seen the original, you aren't going to think Scary Movie 3 is funny.
The cast does a good job with the material, but its almost like you are watching separate movies, with Anna Farris in the Ring, and Charlie Sheen in Signs.  The characters never really combine and the movie doesn't flow too well.
There hasn't been a good spoof movie since the Naked Gun in my opinion.  (Wrongfully Accused was okay.)  The problem is that the recent films try to build a movie around spoofing another movie.  Why not just try and tell a story, then build your spoofs and gags around the story.  That's been the consistent theme of most good spoof movies.
A good spoof movie should be funny if you haven't seen the original that it is parodying, and Scary Movie 3 was just confusing if you hadn't seen the Ring or Signs or 8 Mile.",1086048000,,1404,4.304182509505703

1986040,3,B0001AW0HU,"MOVIE: What we have here is a new take on the Scary Movie series. David Zucker is the man behind such satires as The Naked Gun movies and the first Airplane. His brother Jerry directed the hilarious Rat Race. So, comedy is in the blood of the Zuckers. I do admit that this movie is not the best of what Zucker has done and the reason for that is he is trying to appeal to the teenage audience, and boy did it work. The movie opened up to $48 million thanks to its successful marketing. The only reason I can see this film seems ""stupid"" to so many people is that it is complete chaos, nothing makes any sense, and it's really a montage of jokes. I find that this works well in this movie. It would be insulting for the writers to try and give us an actual plot to follow while spoofing so many movies. Movies like Airplane, The Naked Gun, Spy Hard, are spoofing usually one movie while throwing in other references here and there. This movie pokes fun at so many films, lots of them not horror movies at all. What makes the film so enjoyable is that you will laugh from start to finish without a break. I personally like Zucker's style of comedy versus the Wayans Brothers. Bringing the level of comedy to PG-13 was a smart move as the first two R rated films were at some times more grotesque than funny. This movie handles itself well in being funny and entertaining to watch and if you call it ""stupid"", at least try and come up with a more original adjective and have some reasoning for the movie because everyone I know who hated the movie labeled it as ""stupid"".
VIDEO: The video is pretty crisp considering it's a comedy that will most likely be a one night stand rather than a classic. The widescreen version is what I have and it looks very nice except for some video noise that plagues some scenes. Otherwise a nice presentation from Dimension and Miramax.
AUDIO: There's a Dolby 5.1 mix, and really it's perfect for the type of movie this is. The sound isn't anything to get excited about and you really shouldn't get excited. This isn't the movie you'd pop in to show off your surround system, but then again the sound suits the movie.
PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The disc comes in the average keepcase. A decent amount of extras are also on this disc. You have the typical sneak peeks on this Disney disc, but the only trailers are for The Osbornes DVD sets. . . why is beyond me. There is an alternate ending that is pretty funny, a funny blooper reel, deleted scenes with optional commentary, Behind the scenes of the alternate ending, a very nice  making of that isn't just a 7 minute thing with interviews, and then a more entertaining making of. There is also a feature commentary with a bunch of the crew. The deleted and extended scenes have some funny moments, but I agree with their choices in removing them cause they are not all that great. Overall a very nice bunch of extras that are fun to watch.

  The Wayans have nothing to do with this film.  None of the Wayans are in it.
  This third film is not as funny as the first film.  The story is mostly stolen from RINGU (1998), THE RING (2002) and SIGNS (2002) with touches of THE MATRIX (1999) and MATRIX 2 (2003).  Only Anna Faris as ""Cindy"" and Regina Hall as ""Brenda"" who were in SCARY MOVIE (2000) and SCARY MOVIE 2 (2001) are in this sequel.  Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex join the cast.  Ajay Naidu as ""Sayaman"" and Jeremy Piven as the newscaster, offer funny bits.  Cameo appearances by Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Camryn Manheim, Darrell Hammond, Leslie Nielsen, George Carlin, Simon Cowell and many black rap artists.  Edward Moss played ""MJ"" in make-up that resembled more like ""Planet of the Apes (2001).
  This DVD includes in ""Special features"" over 20 deleted and extended scenes with alternate ending that includes more UFO's, ""The Hulk"", the Matrix courtyard, another Ajay Naidu cameo, and ""MJ"" bit.

I've seen all of them so, I thought that this movie made you laugh your head off! It's better if you see all of the movies. Anyway, the special features on the DVD are GREAT!!! There is an alternate ending that isn't very professional, but makes the movie seem a whole lot different, and gives you many extra laughs!! In the opening scene, the movie begins with a spoof of The Ring. Pam Anderson & Jenny McCarthy find out that they are ""losing brain cells by every second of the day because of TV and their cylicone mollicules"". So, if the opening scene made you laugh this much, who knows how funny it'll be. EVERYTHING IN THE WHOLE MOVIE IS HILARIOUS!!! Don't rent it, buy it. Buy the DVD!!!",1085270400,,839,4.384615384615385

The extras were pretty good on the one espically the deleted scenes.  I would have like to have seen the movie with alternate ending.  It's kinda weird to watch because part of it is with no background music.  They cut out a couple of scene I would have like to seen in the full lenght film and the aliens were more frightening in the deleted scenes.
Finally the girls are pretty hot in this movie and act like they have no clue.  I guess it is what you should have expected from a movie like this. A good parady",1085097600,,732,4.048611111111111
1986045,5,B0001AW0HU,"""Scary Movie 3"" is funny.  I could use that one sentence as my review, and it would be good enough.  Funny.
However, I think you want more.  The plot: a farmer wakes up in his bedroom to his daughter screaming.
A reporter has discovered a video tape that, when watched, gives you seven days to live, before you die a horrible death.
That's bare bones, I agree--but the humor revolves around those two main plots, taken from ""Signs"" and ""The Ring.""  Also parodied: ""8 Mile,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""The Others,"" and many more.
The movie stars Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris (from the first two movies), and Simon Rex.  However, be on the lookout for cameos (and some extended scenes) featuring: Leslie Nielsen (in his first actually funny role in quite a while), George Carlin, Eddie Griffith, Queen Latifah, Denise Richards, and all your favorite rap stars.
The extras are incredible, too.  They feature: two making-of documentaries (one real, one for fun); an alternate ending (a half-hour's worth); deleted scenes; outtakes; commentary; a making-of for the alternate ending; and, if you really want, Spanish subtitles (try to follow along, I dare you).
""Scary Movie 3"" isn't scary at all, but it's flat-out hilarious!  This is one for every comedy fan.  A must-have.",1084924800,3,1254,4.938095238095238
1986046,5,B0001AW0HU,"The movie started off slow but then things picked up and I really mean it. The 8-Mile parody,Quenn Latifah's character and the Michael Jackson skit was the funniest. Leslie Neilsen's character was also good. It is amazing he was once an actor in serious roles and now he is fantastic in comedy. My niece laughed at everything in the movie. Including the rap singers shooting themselves to death for stupid reasons. The cast and the writing was good and I would put this movie on my list as one of the top ten funniest.",1084924800,,518,4.5212765957446805
1986047,3,B0001AW0HU,"Sometimes you just need to laugh. Let it all out and have a good time with a silly, disposable piece of fluff like Scary Movie 3. I was never really a huge fan of the series, although I enjoyed the original and pretty much had no feeling whatsoever for the misguided Part 2. So, what's on target this time?. What's the plot?. Our young heroine Cindy Campbell(the returning, and lovely, Anna Faris from SM 1 and 2), is now a reporter for the local news. She stumbles onto a hot story about crop circles and alien invasions, after this phenomena lands on the farm of a man and his brother(Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex), in a hysterical spoof of ""Signs"". There is also a weird videotape going around that after you watch it, you get a phone call saying ""seven days"" and you die in that amount of time. Cindy believes that the two things are somehow connected. Besides ""Signs"", the big movie parodied here is ""The Ring"", and the filmmakers manage to really hit spot on with the spoof of that film. Blonde Playboy bombshells Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson appear in the film's opening minutes mimicking the opening minutes of ""The Ring"". Others who appear in the film include a dreadlocked Anthony Anderson, Camryn Manheim, Jeremy Piven, Ja Rule, Macy Gray, George Carlin, Eddie Griffin, Queen Latifah, and D.L. Hughley, among others. Sheen's real life wife Denise Richards has a cameo, and in a bit of inspired casting, Leslie Nielsen as the president. Nielsen is always a pleasure, but he does look like he has aged a bit. The only other holdover from the previous SM films is Regina Hall as Brenda. No matter what happens to her in other SM films, Brenda always manages to find her way back into each installment, and it is nice to have Hall back. Even though she gets a pretty short role this time out, she is always fun to watch. Other films getting the spoof treatment here include ""8 Mile"", ""The Others"", and ""The Matrix"" films. It's funny that the one thing that got the series back into some kind of shape and made it better than the original was no longer having the original creators, The Wayans clan, on board. The maestro of spoof, David Zucker, is the one on board this time. The genius behind the ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun"" films, is calling the shots, with Pat Proft, he of ""Hot Shots"" fame and others, on script duty. That alone is enough to give this film a look. The film, while still coming across as a hodepodge, slapped together kind of film, is more solidly backed up and filmed than the second one. The cast is a lot better, and there's just a better vibe here. The jokes and gags come fast and furious, and some completely fall flat. Like most others have said, this isn't a problem since there will be a handful more in the coming seconds and minutes and they usually hit the target. There's nothing wrong with harmless pieces of transparent fluff like this. The chance of letting one's self relax and just get silly is always a welcomed pleasure. Scary Movie 3 was intended as nothing more than escapism and it achieves that. Nothing more, nothing less.",1084838400,,3078,4.5577617328519855

1986050,3,B0001AW0HU,"Without the participation of the Wayans Brothers, SCARY MOVIE 3, helmed by the talented David Zucker, is not as crude, crass, or sexually ignited film the first two were...and that's to its credit.  Although not quite as hilarious as the first, it far surpasses no. 2, and with Zucker's trademark AIRPLANE/NAKED GUN humor, the jokes are fast and furious.  I agree that the 8 MILE spoof was unnecessary, and very little humor was elicited during any of the rap sequences.  Again, in an attempt to keep and lure youngsters, this was probably injected for commercial use rather than creative.  Some of the best gags involve Brenda's battle with the evil girl in the living room, while friend Cindy doesn't believe her because Brenda's been pulling some pretty sick gags on her prior to this attack.  There is a continued use of gags that might be considered in poor taste:  the abomination that happens to Brenda at the wake; the inclusion of a priest who obviously has designs on young Cody; and the Michael Jackson lookalike all test the good taste warning, but I have to admit (shame, shame) they were funny.
Of the cast, the good ones:  Anna Faris (always the heart and soul of the Scary Movies); Queen Latifah (hilarious as the Oracle); Leslie Nielsen (a wonderfully confused president); Jeremy Piven (the newscaster with the looks and not the brains); Drew Mikuska (Cody, the little kid who gets whopped around in road runner violence); Regina Hall (her Brenda will be missed if any more sequels come); Denise Richards (Charlie Sheen's real-life, who has a pretty funny dying scene); Charlie Sheen (he tries so hard to be serious, he's hilarious); and of course Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy in the movie's opener where they parody Pamela and Tommy Lee's home video.
The movie hits its mark and it misses some too.  Thank God they didn't use the alternate Hulk ending included in deleted scenes; it was interminably long and not very funny.
SCARY MOVIE 4?  Probably...let's hope it's as entertaining as this one!",1084838400,,2020,4.865889212827988
1986051,4,B0001AW0HU,"This movie had me in stitches!  This third effort is the best of the three movies.  With the help of one of the Zucker brothers, this movie actually makes this so much better than what the Wayans did in the last two films.  Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson are a hoot.  But it's Leslie Nielsen who steals the show as the President!  Watch and laugh out loud!",1084665600,,360,4.313432835820896
1986052,3,B0001AW0HU,"""Scary Movie 3"" parodies a number of scare flicks. Viewer who have seen certain movies, such as ""Signs"", ""The Ring"", and ""The Matrix"", will better understand some of the jokes and sight gags around which the thin story line revolves. Unfortunately, the film loses some of its focus, as it digresses into a parody of Eminem's film ""8 Mile"", which is not a scary movie. Still, the movie has an impressive cast, boasting such luminaries as Pamela Anderson and her pneumatic breasts, Jenny McCarthy, Charlie Sheen, Camryn Manheim, Jeremy Piven, Anna Faris, Simon Rex, George Carlin, Queen Latifah, Leslie Nielsen, Simon Cowell (as himself), and a whole slew of music stars, including Macy Gray ( as herself).
The plot line is quite thin, however, as it revolves around a cute, air headed reporter, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who is interested in the crop circles found on  the farm of a former clergyman named Tom (Charlie Sheen), who lives on the farm with his brother, George (Simon Rex), a budding would be rapper. Cindy believes that the aliens who made the crop circles have a connection to a mysterious video tape that ensures the death of its viewer within seven days. The President of the United States (Leslie Nielsen) becomes involved in this falderal, when alien invasion seems imminent.
This movie is not for everyone.  It has some really funny moments, such as Simon Cowell's turn as a music critic in a rap club, where he finally gets his just desserts. Queen Latifah is terrific as ""The Oracle"", as is George Carlin as ""The Architect"". Leslie Nielsen reigns supreme as our daffy president. The interjection of a Michael Jackson look-a-like is pretty funny, though I am sure Michael Jackson himself would disagree, as the pedophile innuendo is, indeed, a little jarring.  One of the children in the film, Cody (Drew Mikuska), who has a number of funny moments due to his ability to read minds, is likewise subject to a lot of outright physical violence in the movie, a concept that I found very disturbing and not at all funny.
There is, however,  quite a bit of slapstick and a lot of sight gags. Everything is fair game. I think that the movie would have been a lot better had it kept its original focus and not digressed into a parody of ""8 Mile"", as it diluted the premise of the film. This film is almost as funny as the first Scary Movie and funnier than the second one, though that is not saying much. Everyone gives excellent performances. The problem with the film is that it ends up being neither fish nor fowl. So, it ultimately is not as good as it should have been, given the cast with which it is blessed.
The DVD has excellent audio and visuals. It provides the usual film commentary, as well as quite a number of deleted scenes with commentary. There is also an alternate ending in which a parody of the Hulk is interjected. All I can say is that it is a good thing that another ending was filmed. The bottom line is that one should rent this film before buying it.",1084665600,16,2993,4.630885122410546
1986053,3,B0001AW0HU,"The slapstick-person-gets-creamed comedy is pretty funny at times, but the rest of the movie can become a bit boring.  I think the opening scenes were the most lame: One big-busted blonde telling another big-busted blonde the channel changer won't work because it's backwards, but she can't figure out how to turn it around, etc.  Pathetic humor was rampant in this film.  There are a few scenes where the little boy in the movie gets smashed up that I found pretty humorous.
All in all, if you like this type of low-budget humor, you'll probably enjoy the film.  But if your just about sick of movies like this, you'll be just as sick with this one.

Scary Movie 3 basically spoofs three films, Signs, The Ring and 8 Mile. I particularly hated Signs, so I was happy to see SM3 nail its weak points.
The 8 Mile scenes are great, the head to head rapping battles even featuring an appearance by Simon Cowell. Leslie Neilson has a prominent role and brings the usual great slapstick that he does to all his films. Another pleasant surprise is Jeremy Piven, co-star of Old School, a very funny comedian. He has an unfortunately small but very funny role as a newscaster.
The only weak part would have to be the star, Ana Farris. You'll quickly get tired of her constantly surprised face - I really didn't get why they chose her.

Only two characters from the first two movies remain, Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as Brenda.

1986068,1,B0001AW0HU,"""Scary Movie,"" in my opinion, is a great modern comedy. It's witty, fast-paced, relatively smart in it's moronic-nature, and a true laugh riot. ""Scary Movie II"" is a flawed, but, at times, very funny spoof, that has a bit too much of a serious, if under-developed, plot to be considered a non-stop laffer.
""Scary Movie III"" was an attempt by Dimension to re-launch the series, with a new director, in the form of David Zucker. Mr. Zucker is possibly the most inconsistent filmmaker in Hollywood, with his works ranging from the comedy classic ""Airplane!"" to the unfunny and uninspired teen comedy ""My Boss's Daughter,"" with Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid. I am sure the studio had hoped this film would follow in the tracks of the former, but it's even worse than the completely awful latter.
The film is pretty much without laughs. I won't deny it tries damn hard. It throws enough ""jokes"" at you to leave more than a couple of bruises, but the problem is: Few, if any, of them are funny, from over-used ""The Matrix"" spoofs to an ""8 Mile"" spoof that seems more like a remake of the 2002 Eminem/Kim Basinger film than a spoof. And, just to think, if spoofs this bad were in the theatrical cut, imagine the ones on this DVD that were deleted, including sure-to-be cringe-inducing spoofs of Ang Lee's much-reviled ""Hulk"" and Ridley Scott's blockbuster thriller ""Alien.""
The film has a handsome cast, headlined by the likes of Charlie Sheen (""The Arrival""), an actor who seems to become more and more talented as he ages, and Anna Faris, who oddly enough was in one of this year's worst movies (This film) and one of it's best (The Bill Murray-starrer ""Lost In Translation""), whose dynamite facial expressions provide the film's ONLY laughs, except perhaps for George Carlin as ""The Matrix Reloaded""s' The Architect character.
In the end, this is two hours of film, with three laughs or so. Do I recommend it? Do the math. If you can't, the answer is: h*ll no!",1076371200,2,1955,4.719298245614035

It all starts when Cindy Campbell is sent to investigate some strange happenings on a crop circle in the country. Then she winds up watching a mysterious video tape that tells you that in a weeks time you will die. Cindy must find a way to stop the tape from killing again as well as helpig ensure the safety of her friends and colleagues from any further miraculous deaths. Charlie Sheen and comic legend Leslie Nielson are just some of the names cast in this blockbuster comedy.,1076371200,3,561,4.6767676767676765
1986070,4,B0001AW0HU,I thought the third installment was hillarious. I wasn't a big fan of the other two.

I had no complaintes about the film.
The best part was when Charlie Sheen's charecter (sry cant remem,ber the name) was peeing and we could hear him in the next room and his daughter screams ""hes gonna kill me"" and he goes ""I'm in the bathroom, I'll help u when I get out!""",1075593600,,518,3.980769230769231

Scary Movie 3, on the other hand, had a rather stupid intro, but the rest of the movie was a riot. Of course, it centers around spoofs and goofy characters resulting in very stupid humor, but you can't help but find it enjoyable. This one centers around spoofs of ""The Ring"", ""Signs"", ""8 Mile"" and ""The Others."" It also features an array of celebrity charaters and cameos with everyone from Charlie Sheen and Pam Anderson to Queen Latifah and Macy Gray.

1986075,5,B0001AW0HU,"I have seen the first two movies in the ""Scary Movie"" seris, but I didn't like them. Then I saw the commerials for this movie, and relized that it was rated PG-13. Then I saw the movie, and I thought it was great. It worked perfectly as a PG-13 movie. A comedy movie would appeal everybody, and it doesn't have to be filled with language, and non-stop sex humor and drugs to be funny. That's why I liked this movie. It was a hard PG-13 but it still worked better than the first movies did. I think that's the reason why nobody liked this movie. Because of the PG-13 rating. I thought it was great.
This movie spoofed present day horror films like ""The Ring,"" and ""Signs."" It also spoofed movies like ""The Matrix,"" and ""8 Mile."" There were also cameos by Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffin, and Simon from American Idol, doing what he does best, rating people's preformances, and getting what he deserves... shot.
The returning main character Cindy appears n this movie. Now she is a new anchorwomen who has found a mysterious videotape, like ""The Ring,"" that will kill anybody who watches it in seven days. But nobody believes her, including her friend and her nephews teacher. On the other side of town, Farmer Tom is wondering about the mysterious crop circles found in his wheat fields, like ""Signs."" His wannabe rap star white brother George, has dreams of hitting it big, like ""8 Mile."" George goes to a rap-off contest because of his friend and rap promotor Mahalik. (Mahalik is played by Anthony Anderson, an actor who I think is very funny, and has chances of being a very good future comandian.) Cindy uses the Oracle and The Architect from ""The Matrix,"" movies to help her find out more about the videotape. The King of Spoof Leslie Neilson plays The President of the United States who eventually becomes involved when it becomes clear that aliens are coming to Earth. Also Cindy finds out more about the videotape that could lead to answers.
This movie had so much humor, that while you are laughing at one joke, another one has already started, and you miss that and another one is already starting. It is satire. It is like ""Death to Smoochy,"" and movie that is a satire to Barney and childrens broadcasting. This is a satire of other movies. Similiar to ""Death to Smoochy."" What I am waiting for now, is a spoof of the ""Scary Movie 1-3"" movies. That would be intesting. A spoof of a spoof. See ""Scary Movie 3,"" and watch it like it's own movie. Watch it like the other two never came out. Don't compare it to the first. It is its own movie, and it always will be. I liked it!

This movie is definetly the latter. It is a laugh out loud comedy without most of the gross humor of the first two and it's sometimes scary.,1074297600,,296,4.303571428571429

No, the critics were out to mount Shawn and Marlan Wayans as using gross, sophmoric, clichd jokes and unispired storylines.  The ironic thing is, the style of this third Scary Movie is more uninspired than the last two.  In the first two, I actually laughed.  I though, ""oh my God, this is hilarious.""  I didn't see half the jokes coming, even as far-fetched as they were.  In this third movie, I could predict 90% of all the jokes in it.  And these jokes didn't make me laugh, they made me frown.  ""Funny, he hits his head three times against a lamp.""  Wow.  That's some great writing.  Not to say the first two were well writen, but hey, at least I laughed.  If you wanna see a good spoof movie, see Airplane.  A comedy movie is suppose to be funny.  This movie is not.  Let's not get confused.  Technically, maybe Scary Movie 3 had a little going for it, but it's not funny, having said that, it's not even fun to watch 30 minutes of.

There wasn't anything in it that was bad. One of my favorite scenes is the part where the actor who is supposed to be the ""younger brother"" in Signs, and ""Eminem"" in Eight Mile says he is great with kids, lol.

It parodied 8 mile, signs, and the ring, mostly. My theory is that they ran out of classic horror movies, then ran out of new horror movies, so they used 8 mile.  Great on Zucker's part.

1986088,4,B0001AW0HU,"Last night, upon an adventure to see Kill Bill Vol. 1, I discovered that I was not of age. So as a back-up plan, a group of friends and I viewed probably one of the most surprisingly humours movies of the year. Let's face facts, Scary Movie was probably the best of the series, the humour was fresh, the plot was something out of the ordinary, and the characters were memorable. Scary Movie 2, removed several characters but kept a majority of the key players from the first movie, and placed them in a new surrounding. This unfortunately was only funny for so long, as half way through the movie, the jokes just started feeling dryer and almost predictable at times. I still laughed, but I felt forced to at times. Because of the second movie, I had low expectations of this film. I thought that the idea of making it 14A (In Canada) was going to take away some of the humour and possibly ruin the franchise, worse than Scary Movie 2 did. As it turns out, this was a very funny movie. The new characters did not take anything away from the plot and the acting wasn't half bad. The physical and gooball humour proved effective this time around. It was actually good to see a funny movie that didn't have word F*** in every sentence. Not to mention the movie was short, so it almost felt like punchline after punchline. I did however miss a few jokes because I was too busy recovering for the ""FUNERAL SCENE"". Nonetheless, I didn't miss the stoner humour at all. Shorty is funny and all, but only in small doses. Another thing I found great about this movie were the parodies of 8-Mile, The Matrix, and The Ring. The whole Video Tape sequence had to be one of the funniest horror parodies I've ever seen. Considering it was potty humour, I just didn't care. Also, I really enjoyed how the new director had made reference to his old films and used Leslie Neilson in this movie to be his same goofball self. A few things I didn't like as much about this movie were some of the visuals. Don't get me wrong there were decent special effects and cool make up jobs, but the aliens were just crap. They're appearance kinda spoiled the idea they were even supposed to be freaky. I also didn't find myself getting too into this movie from the start, unlike the first two films, there were no real moments of suspense and no real reasons to be too freaked out. Minus a few minutes in the basement scene. There were only like 2 deaths, but then again it wasn't based on any type of movie that went over the top with death scenes. Other than that though, it was a solid effort and I can give them an A for that. Unfortunately I gave this movie a B, because the story was kinda stupid and the aliens looked horrible",1069545600,,2701,4.3717693836978135
1986089,4,B0001AW0HU,"I needed something silly after a hard day's night at the mall, plus I was so eager to see The Ring being parodied, hence off to watch Scary Movie 3.  In the pretitle segment, there are two airhead blondes, played to perfection by two Playboy centerfold alumni, Jenny McCarthy and Pam Anderson, who talk about a weird video-no, not the one about the couple doing it like aboard the yacht, etc. but one that results in the viewer getting a phone call and then being killed in seven days.  Sound familiar?
Cindy Campbell, the main character from the first two movies, is now a TV anchor (and a blonde to boot) and is interested in a series of crop circles that are appearing on the Logan farm, which read ""Attack here"" with an arrow pointing at the farm.  The Logans are Tom (Charlie Sheen) and George, the former being an ex-reverend who lost his faith since the death of his wife in an accident years ago.  The latter is the younger brother who wants to make something of himself by competing in a rap contest.  OK, we all know which movie that is, right?
I never bothered to watch 8 Mile, though I saw previews for it, and Eminem gets quite a drubbing as a stage-nervous George barfs in a latrine, while someone's sitting on it, and when he pulls his white hood up, it's pointed like a KKK member, which gets him in hot water.  The repeated refrain of his giving up does get old after a while.
The three prime targets under attack here are The Ring, Signs, and 8 Mile, and it's the first that gets the most laughs.  The video itself is parodied, especially a scene parodying the Matrix, where the Oracle (Queen Latifah) interracts with the woman combing her hair in one of the funniest scenes in the movie.  Another funny scene is with the girl climbing out from the well and through the TV screen.
As for Signs, the scene of Mel Gibson's character talking to his wife for the last time is parodied, but the funnier part involves the sheriff trying to explain to Logan using food as an analogy.  Logan is clueless as to what he's saying.  She holds up a hot dog and breaks it in half to explain his wife Annie being bisected by the truck.  The dim Logan thinks her w---ie is broken.  There are other X-rated metaphors used that make it hilarious.  What's also an in-joke is that Annie is played by Denise Richards, Charlie Sheen's real-life wife.
However, there are some jabs against The Sixth Sense, as Cindy's nephew keeps telling people the future.  At a funeral, he tells one man he is going to be lucky tonight.  He then tells the girl he's with, ""Don't worry.  He doesn't know you're actually a man.""  Ooh!
Anna Faris is the best performer as the lovable but goofy Cindy, whose expressions alone bely her comedic nature.  Regina Hall (Brenda) who here plays the teacher of Cindy's nephew, doesn't have much laughs as she did in the first two movies, but her facial expression upon falling victim to the girl of the video is priceless, and her funeral scene is side-splitting.  Leslie Nielsen plays the US president and is as clutzy and deadpan as he was in The Naked Gun movies.
Like the three Scream movies, this tops the second movie, though not the original.  However, one would think that with David Zucker (Airplane!) at the helm, one would think he would have something better given that he's the godfather of the parody genre.  His touch is evident, as he eliminates the Wayan Bros's pot gags (and the Wayanses themselves) for Airplane and Naked Gun-type hijinks.  How one likes this movie depends on how one likes Zucker's style, plus some non-PC pain gags, especially on Cody, Cindy's nephew who keeps getting hit by cars or smacked in the face by very solid objects.",1069545600,,3682,4.521870286576169
1986090,3,B0001AW0HU,"Scary Movie 3, the third film in the horror-film spoof franchise is losing its grip.  In other words this film wasn't at all as funny as the first two, though it was slightly better than the 2nd, it doesn't give justice to the Scary Movie franchise.  Though for its few comic moments it does get quite a few laughs.  The 8 Mile spoof is truly funny.  Also the rating is an issue, if this was ""R"" maybe the humor could've been most likely a lot cruder and nastier but a lot funnier too.  And we had the beloved Wayan brothers behind this movie then it might be a great deal better.
  As for the plot, well it's nothing special.  I'm not going to bother explaining, because you don't go to see this movie for a plot, I mean come on, you go and see it for the laughs.  Anthony Anderson was really funny here along with Simon Rex who plays the role of Emimen so to speak in 8 Mile.  The joke with the kid who kept getting randomly hit and struck every other second was just dumb after the 3rd time, it didn't make me laugh any more and it was pretty silly.  Knowing that David Zucker is behind this movie, the guy who made Airplane! and two of the Naked Guns film you can expect that.  Its obvious to know why Zucker made this picture, mainly just so he could redeem himself after making the horrible ""My Boss's Daughter.""  So making a movie which belongs to a popular franchise is the solution of course, when he's not very triumphant in my opinion.
  Even though at the box-office (in its opening weekend)it took in a stunning $49.5 million, doesn't mean you should go and see it.  Only if there is not another film, or if you have absolutely nothing else to do.  While you're at thought you might as well see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Kill Bill.  Trust me it's not that great, maybe just on one viewing that is.
Scary Movie 3 is rated PG-13 for Pervasive Crude & Sexual Humor, Language and Comic Violence.  The film features a few racist and sterotypical remarks, but all in all is a dumb, tasteless film.

1986091,2,B0001AW0HU,"I went into this film knowing full well what I was getting myself into.  I was prepared for sexy gratuitous sex, wacky violence and a zillion sight gags.  Hell, I was even prepared for pop culture's method of hitting someone over the head with a rubber chicken. I get that Scary Movie 3 is a comedy and I should probably lose myself in it and have some fun.  I did exactly that for the first fifteen minutes. Then the movie just regressed to being hopeless.  I was hopeless to find something to laugh about, with OR at.  There were a few good moments and then there was nothing else.",1069286400,2,583,4.3119266055045875
1986092,4,B0001AW0HU,"Ok, Scary Movie 3 is hilarious but has some off cliche Airplane jokes which makes the Wayans a must. In Scary Movie-they spoof Scream, I Know What..., Blair Witch, Matrix, Sixth Sense, Scream 2, Budweiser commercial, etc. Scary Movie 2 spoofs House on Haunted Hill, Exorcist, Hannibal, Little Shop of Horrors, Nike commercial, Charlie's Angels, Crouching tiger, It, etc.
  Now Scary Movie 3 spoofs the Ring, Signs, 8 Mile, Final Destination, Independence Day, The Matrix, Verizon Wireless commercial, etc. You'd have to see all these films to understand the twister humor Zucker fairly and poorly produces.
  What happened to Ray and Brenda's relationship-and cindy and Buddy;s? Not that the drama matters but it would help. It is funny and I enjoyed Anna Faris' acting and hopes she'll return for the 4th and spoof like final Destination 2, Identity, etc. Just go see it IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!1",1068422400,,896,5.116438356164384
1986093,3,B0001AW0HU,"Scary Movie 3 is a farce and funny. The gags and tributes or satires to Signs, The Ring, The Matrix and ten other movies are hysterical. Light fun and great visual gags. The first film is still the best - but this one has its moments.
It really tried to take long jabs at things and rely a lot of slapstick especially at a wake sequences. Directed by David Zucker - of all the Airplane movies it tends to drag a little.
Pamala Anderson and Jenny McCarthy are hysterical in the beginning and this really is Charlie Sheen's film. I love the fact that Mr. Sheen loves doing these films. Hot Shots 1 and 2 and Load Weapon and doesn't mind doing funny gags, jokes, slapstick and just plain old fashion prat falls!
Fun. Wait for the DVD - I hope it will have more extras ! (11-10-03)",1068422400,,777,4.256756756756757
1986094,3,B0001AW0HU,"I laughed a lot during the first Scary Movie, I barely laughed at all during the second one though. I remembered what it was like to have a good laugh again though while watching Scary Movie 3. During the first one I would think "" this is stupid"", yet I'd be laughing hard while thinking that. The second one I just found plain stupid without the laughs. In 3rd, I once again found myself laughing thinking ""this is stupid""  though. Jennifer Macarthy and Pamela Anderson are actually pretty funny in the beginning. I like how they poke fun at Pam's little home movie she made with Tommy Lee.
  Leslie Nielson is hilarious of course as the President of United States. Seeing him on screen again made me want to see a Naked Gun 4 get made because he still got it. Anna Farris is back and is pretty funny as Cindy Campell once again. I actually think she was the best part of all the movies. This time she's blonde and is supposed to be like the women in the Ring . She watches over this kid who's mom died giving birth to him. In a scene that's supposed to be like the one in Signs she trys to comfort him by telling him what his mom's birth to him was like. That's pretty funny as well becuase she's scaring him more than she's making him feel better.
  That kid alone gets laughs because he can read the future for people just by walking by them. Roger Ebert called him the Sixth Sense kid but the kid in that movie saw ghosts, he couldn't tell the future. So don't know what movie that idea was actually from. I like how when guy walks by with women and the kid says ""you're gonna get luck"" and to the women he says ""he doesn't know you're a guy"". Some jokes don't work that well like I said. The whole 8-Mile part just wasn't that funny. They could've done a lot more with it. I mean the guy that's supposed to be Eminem just raps normally and what he says isn't comical or anything. The part before that when he gets stage fright and runs to a stall to puke and pukes on a guy on the bowl got some laughs though. Although I liked this movie, I don't think they should make a 4th one. Since this movie is making a lot of money I'm sure they'll make another though.",1067990400,3,2166,4.172248803827751
1986095,1,B0001AW0HU,"Upon very scarce reflection, readily leaving the clutches of Scary Movie 3's cinematic inter-sanctum of unabashedly relentless moronic cinematic reverie, narrative infantile debauchery, and childish moronic incessant prattling that apparently to some represents storytelling, I simply asked myself one question (beyond where's the antacid): was this worth ninety minutes of my lifetime? My simple most sincere reply was unequivocally no. With one rather inexpressible blood-caked sigh of utter unrepentantly in-depth mortal relief of being on the other side of viewing this newly deplorably first-class cinematic catastrophe of Saddam and Gomorrah proportions, my mind races to locate closure. Where do I remotely begin to chronicle my mind's Dante-like rise from these rabidly mentally sterilizing cinematic ashes that give Daytime Soap Operas a descent name?
How could I, how shall I, and how can I decisively come to grips with a film so vacuous that I could scarcely not imagine many losing more than their ticket fares after seeing this stupendously slobbering and bow-legged lame mutt of a film. It definitely remains an outstanding feat in today's ever-expanding unimpressive movie universe of redundancies to view such an utterly wretched anemic sophomoric estimation of public intelligence as is this, one wanders whether David Zucker and company believes the general public can grasp the collective works of Dr. Seuss without reaching for the Cliffs notes. So cavalierly inane in it's searingly infantile cannibalization of descent films and so irrevocably comatose and manically entrenched in creative traction over the telling of it's own story, David Zucker's Scary Movie 3 vapidly stays alive by squawking loudly and showing nothing.
Flying on the idiotic fumes of the assumed lowest common denominators that have proven box-office worthy in the past, we are amply given heaping gaping handfuls of thorough and severe unpleasantness alcoholically chased with unappeasably fake ironic malice, contrived vile smugness vaguely disguised as wit, and richly ruinous torrents of picturesque story revealed to be nothing more than scandalizing non-existent window-dressing stuffed recklessly into a tofu turkey with no skin solid enough to withhold the biblically fateful sour implosion of wanton perversity from within. The saying that beauty is in the eye of beholder should somehow hold true here. However, it appears that this particular beholder has taken the last fateful Concord flight out of the continent.
Yet without all of my mental angst and suffering at reaching the very absolute bottom of the movie-making barrel, I would have missed all those wonderfully delightful silver-screen embroidered moments that will last a shell-shocked psyche several lifetimes to recover from: the President of the United States (played by the eternal straight man of the ages Leslie Nielson) vigorously browbeating a handicapped group at the White House, a gay priest pedophilia romance vignette adorned with the disquieting aroma of scented candles, bouncing virginal school-girls headlined by a very(ahem)convincing Pamela Anderson debating environmental silicon issues with the sincerity of a Hugh Hefner interview, a mad-cap funeral wake over-zealously celebrated with a corpse hot-potato pinata-imploding Marx brothers comedy routine, vehicular child car accidents orchestrated for random giggles, and scores of other bargain-basement dollar-bin comedy routines that could only make Andrew Dice Clay seem envious.
One more fleeting thought comes to mind in relation to this quality-deprived Love-Canal bastion of cinematic obsolescence: when considering a ragingly mentally impaired film who's execution of simple physical gags pales mightily to that of a normal toddler who could do them superiorly in heartbeat without ever missing a stride. We are unceremoniously left with generic Crispy Cremes, Oscar Meyer wieners, advertisement tie-ins aplenty, and a shrill imprecise ever-increasing deflating helium rupturing feeling that we've been down these particular roads before and with radically better company.
As for the Dimension DVD release of this film coming out shortly, for those still interested, one would hopefully await the inclusions of a David Zucker and crew film commentary track, digitally enhanced 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack and pristine picture quality transfer, film theatrical trailers, and various other documentary and film supplements yet to come for the eventual home video release of the DVD.
As for yours truly, I'd rather be bound to a Iron interrogator's chair and forced to watched 10 hours of the Red Green Show then return to this.",1067904000,4,4673,5.677142857142857

(...) What in the hell were the Wayans brothers thinking by not making this movie?  It goes nowhere, and the crude and unusual humor found in the first two flicks were nowhere to be found.  There was actually little kids in the theater, which should have been my sign to leave.  There were a couple of funny scenes, but I already saw them in the trailers on tv.  Don't go see this movie.  In fact, it would be a waste of time and money to even rent this movie.  I'm all for simple humor but come on.  How ridiculous.

Cyndy has become a reporter who has to investigate a video that kills you when you watch it and aliens are coming to stop the killings, but people don't know that, so on the story goes.
It has so many good points, but they are almost all equaled by bad points. They kill off Brenda ( I have heard ppl saying that this was stupid, you ppl obviously haven't seenthe first scary movie where Brenda is killed in the movie theater, and here she is in the 3rd, and there she was in the 2nd so cool your jets! ) And some of the humor was just stupid, like the craziness in the news studio, that was just stupid.

Before i went to see it, i came onto this site to see how others thought it was before spending money to see it, i read reviews saying it was ""very funny"" and ""the best in the series"", believe me, it wasn't. It's not just the fact that the jokes were horrible, but most of the humor was just boring. Unlike in the past 2 movies, where horror movies were made fun of with sick, crude humor that was actually fun to laugh at, now all types of movies are being made fun of with stupid jokes that only a ten-year old would find funny.
The story revolves around The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile, the latter of which isn't even a horror movie. The Ring parodies weren't all that great, most being predictible. The Signs parts were very boring and sometimes hard to understand what people were laughing at. The 8 Mile gag was completely awful, nothing about it was funny and it didn't even do a good job making fun of the movie. It also showed some parodies of comedy films themselves, such as Bruce Almighty.
In all, the whole movie was a failure. Nothing about Scary Movie 3 was funny, except maybe a few of the minor parts that were shown in the trailer already. The rating being PG-13 was a complete joke, as it still featured alot of very...rated R type moments. The funniest part of the movie for me was the fact that it had so many cameos. Notice the fact that so many put their time into this trash. Also, the funniest part was seeing Ja Rule on the big screen, i thought he went back to rap?",1067212800,5,1589,4.17915309446254

There were too many obvious ""jokes"" that were just not funny.  It was like reading a third grade riddle book.  This movie had its funny moments, but it was overshadowed with stupidity overall. ....
I also thought that the movie took some things a little overboard.  For example, I thought that the blowing up of Mother Theresa's head in the during an awards ceremony hosted by the President went a bit tasteless.  I did not find that funny.  There were other scenes in which I thought to cross the line, but I will not stress myself to introduce them to you.
The only humor I found to be a little more consistent was the parody of The Ring.  I thought all other attacks on the other movies were short, dumb, and predictable.

1986106,4,B0001AW0HU,"A film by David Zucker
This latest installment of the Scary Movie spoof franchise comes with a new director and a new writing staff.  The creators of the series, The Wayans Brothers, have left the franchise and the new director (David Zucker) was the director of Airplane! and the Naked Gun movies.  This spoof is advertised as spoofing all of today's major horror movies, but primarily works with Signs and The Ring.  The rest of the spoofs are random gags throughout the movie.  As much as it was suggested that it was a horror movie spoof, we also have gags on Lord of the Rings, The Matrix Reloaded, and 8 Mile.
As I mentioned, the plot (such as it is) closely follows that of The Ring and Signs.  These two stories are kept separate for a while but eventually do tie together.  Keep in mind that plot is not the focus of Scary Movie.  Rather, the focus is on throwing as many gags together and hoping that some of them stick well enough to be funny.  Enough of them do that I found this to be a funny movie.  I heard rumors that the Michael Jackson segment was to be removed from the movie, which is a shame because the whole segment (beyond what is in the trailer) is one of the better ones in the movie.  The movie goes for the easy joke in each spoof, but they keep coming so fast that you don't really mind.  Only one scene comes to mind that really bombed (badly, I might add), but as a whole...funny.
I wouldn't put this movie up with the all time great comedies, but this movie is exactly what you expect it to be (especially considering the first two movies).  The one thing I will say is that I'm glad this movie was rated PG-13.  It was a lot less raunchy than the first two movies and I appreciate that a lot.  The movie went overboard on a few scenes, but just not in the level of raunchiness.  This is a low-brow spoof, but I did find it funny enough to recommend (with the understanding that this is a low-brow comedy spoof).",1067212800,3,1944,4.273224043715847

This movie lacked the extremities that pushed scary movie and it's sequel over the edge into new territoy.  Haunted by the usual clichs of any comedy sequel, the cast in SM3 did not seem choice for delivering the one punch lines as well as the previous.  Scenes streched and tired easily.  Mazin and Profit, although trying to follow the Wayne's examples set in the first to films of the franchise, seem to lack the grotesque and random nature of the original writers that made scary movie unique from other comedy spoofs.

This time we are offered up a boring mishmash of nothing but overused and dumb pratfalls. Gone is the drug references and nudity, so instead we get 80 minutes of nothing but people either getting smacked, hit  or falling down. It is just so boring. The likes of Leslie Nielsen & George Carlin are wasted and the Wayans Bros. are sorely missed. Anna Faris returns as the fun Cindy and Brenda is THE best character. So what do they do? Why kill off Brenda (the funniest) early on in the film. Guess Regina Hall could sense this was a stinker and wanted out as soon as possible. The 8 Mile rap take-off was just painful to watch and Anthony Anderson is moan inducing with his scenes. The aliens are so cheap looking that I don't know if it was done on purpose or what. The Zuckers (famous for Airplane) have given us a cheap knockoff that is unfunny and frustrating.

There are a few things that might have contributed to the problems with the movie:1.  The Wayans Brothers didn't have anything to do with this sequel. 2.  The PG-13 rating versus the previous R ratings.  I don't think that a movie has to be R rated to be good but, this movie's problem was that they were trying to make the same kind of gross out jokes and sexual jokes, while trying to maintain a PG-13 rating to make the movie more accessible to teenagers. 3.  They had good potential some funny movie references but they didn't seem to know what to do with it.  4.  It seems like the film makers decided to try and fit as many celebrities in the movie as possible, and then figure out how they would fit in the ""story"" later.  Leslie Nielson and Ja Rule were paired together and had absolutely nothing to contribute to this movie. 5.  There is one scene that is probably the most unfunny scene in the movie for there reason that it is just creepy and gross.  In my opinion the joke is in bad taste and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Im not going to pick on the plot of the movie, because there isn't one but thats not the point of this type of movie. We don't go to these movies for the plot.  Its just meant to be fun and silly. In conclusion, I just want to say that this movie is not as good as the first two but, there are many parts in the movie that will probably make you laugh but don't expect to keep laughing throughout the entire movie.

1986116,3,B0001AW0HU,"Scary Movie 3 is one of those movies that after watching you feel like something was missing from the movie. Like it didn't fufill what you had expected and therefore falls short of your expectations. The movie isn't really bad, but it's not a movie I want to see again or a movie I can't wait to see again. Scary Movie 3 is about Anna Faris (starring role in Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2) who is now older and a newsreporter finding out about a tape (Scary Movie 3's version of the Ring's tape.) She has adopted a son who can tell the future (like in the 6th sense) and she gets a boyfriend who is a white rapper (8 mile.) After meeting up with her bestfriend, played by Regina Hall (supporting role in Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2) who is now a teacher, she begins to hang out with her. Little does she know that her best friend has seen a tape that will kill her in 7 days. Once she dies many other spoofs go on including things from signs, the lord of the rings and the others. The sotries are all connected which is nice because at first I had no clue what was going on.
The movie has very good and funny thing going for it. However David Zucker does not exploit these parts of the movie. Anthony Anderson was very funny in the movie, he definitly should've been in more scenes. Anna Faris' son walks around like a very funny little boy predicting the future. But he too has only a few lines. Kevin Hart and Anthony Anderson have great arguing throughout the movie that is so stupid that it's funny. These too are rare moments.
While Scary Movie 3 has plenty going for it does lack alot of what the previous installments of the movie did have. It doesn't have the crude humor or the sexual content that is completely unexpected. Something the PG-13 rating cant give. I'll miss the Wayans Brothers humor on this installments and any future installments that there not in. It has you miss a huge portion of the movie. I mean I was expecting Shorty (Marlon Wayans) to pop up or somethin. Like him being the aliens or something like that.
Overall Scary Movie 3 was a dissapointment. If the old cas cant come back together then the series should just hang it up right now, while it has a chance to die somewhat shining.",1067040000,,2218,4.321342925659472

The funniest moment I experienced related to this movie was when I bought my ticket.  The local theater had a BOAT LOAD of show times for SM3 and I was having trouble figuring out when the next show time would be.  I asked the ticket agent ""So ... given what time it is now, what's the next logical time for me to see Scary Movie?""
She looked at her monitor ... ""Well, there's Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" at 8:00pm ...""
I laughed out loud ...
For me ... ""Scary Movie 3"" was ""OK"".  Occasionally clever, consistantly sophomoric and mildly amusing ... for me.  BUT ... MOST of the audience with whom I saw Scary Movie 3 seemed to think it was uniformly so funny they couldn't help but laughing.  And, to be fair, there were a few moments that had me laughing.  But only about 20% of the attempts at humor tickled my funny bone.  If you're the sort of person who typically likes what everybody else likes ... you'll probably get a kick out of it.

1986119,4,B0001AW0HU,"I saw the movie tonight at a sneak preview and I thought it was hilarious. Even though the Wayans brothers did not return I still enjoyed it very much and didn't feel like something was missing. The film was definitely better than the second installment, but doesn't beat the original.
There are quite a bit of very funny moments. My personal favorite involved a Michael Jackson incident and I'm not talking about what the preview showed of Michael in the preview. That scene only gets funnier. There is also another line that Charlie Sheen delievers questioning his wife's ability to use her... donut. You'll get it when you see it.
The movie was very funny, but there were just a couple of things that I didn't like. There is a scene involving trying to bring the dead back to life and I don't think that Leslie Nielson belonged in the movie. He seemed a little tacked on. Those are my only two complaints about the movie. Oh yeah, and the movie was only about one hour and fifteen minutes. And I'm not exaggerating.
For those complaining about the change in rating, well you're not missing much. There is still a lot of sexual humor(and is still very funny) and they do mutter one f word somewhere near the beginning (and it is used hilariously). So, be there when it opens this Friday.

1986120,2,B0001AW0HU,"Nothing different here.  Whereas SCARY MOVIE parodied modern teen horror slashers, and SCARY MOVIE 2 mocked more classic numbers, this one showcases all of those supernatural thrillers (such as THE MATRIX, THE RING, SIGNS, etc.)  On the controversy surrounding the PG-13 rating, I didn't really notice any difference in the crudeness of said content, but nevertheless, the jokes seemed watered down.  The film had its moments (the aliens were the highlight of the whole flick), but it wasn't as croud-pleasing as film two.  I had a few chuckles here and there, but there were some moments when the whole audience laughed at a joke and I'd be left out in the cold.  The jokes this time around revolve more around events than the characters, who seem two-dimensional and separate from the extremely basic story.
Considering I saw the sneak preview and I got in free, it was an alright way to spend 80 minutes, but I'm not a huge fan of gross-out movies, especially movies that have nothing going for them besides spoofing other flicks.  This was probably the second best in the series, but overall, I think they should stop right around now, before they drive this thing into the ground.

1986121,4,B0001AW0HU,"I wondered when I watched the trailer for Scary Movie 3 why I was laughing so hard.  Sure I enjoyed the first two films, but they seemed... amateurish.  Yeah, I know the entire series is nothing but crass, low-brow humor, but that trailer was SO funny.  I found myself on the Internet Movie Database ([...]) trying to figure it out.  Much to my surprise, I found David Zucker (one of the three masterminds behind Airplane!) directing and writing AND Kevin Smith producing and writing the film.  Zounds!
I don't know why or how the Wayans brothers aren't involved, but frankly it's for the better.  The movie is absolutely hilarious.  Oh sure, there are jokes so obvious they are like seeing a jumbo jet landing in your front yard, but there are also enough surprises that catch you off guard to more than make up for that.
The ""plot"" purees The Ring, Signs and Eight Mile into a mismatch of parody and slap-stick well enough that you wish the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams would get back together and come up with one more.  This is mostly for two scenes that sustain laughs so long they actually hurt.  Don't get me wrong.  This nothing more than stupid, sophomoric humor, but when in the hands of talented comedic film makers, it becomes a film that demands repeated viewings much like Airplane! and Top Secret.  In other words, a laugh riot.",1066780800,33,1339,4.6075949367088604

8009487,2,B0001AW0HU,I know they made at least one more of these.  And I watched it.  But this was the last Scary Movie that I bought.  It was running out of steam.  And really how often can you watch something like this.  This is mostly a parody of Signs and The Ring.  Leslie Neilson is  his over the top self as The President.,1518134400,,308,3.9508196721311477

8009489,5,B0001AW0HU,"This movie is hilarious to watch alone and even more fun to watch with friends!! I could quote this movie for days!!! Some of my favorite quotes:
Cindy, the TVs leaking!
Big house...only one phone.
All youve done is chase adolescent fantasies! I want to be an astronaut, a cowboy.... a gynecologist to the stars!
And a scary videotape that kills you after 7 days. Were the only station that has it, and were playing it all night.

I could go on & on!! I didn't like Scary Movie 1 & 2, but this remains one of my favorite comedies! Charlie Sheen in his element!",1513900800,,560,4.333333333333333
