6962600,5,B00S6R7494,"I purchased this set for my 3 year old daughter who is an avid fan. My daughter began watching this series about 7 months ago on PBS. To my consternation, PBS changed the broadcast time for Signing Time & my daughter was no longer awake to watch it. I encouraged her to watch it because she was learning & having fun. I was also learning & we converse in sign language & verbally simultaneously. I would highly recommend this series for young children, all young children. It helps in all areas of learning & my daughter has excelled to my delight. I will be purchasing the next set as well.",1453334400,5,591,4.381818181818182
6962601,5,B00S6R7494,My son wanted to learn sign language after he learned to sign his name at cub scouts. We had the first few DVDs and used them with our oldest son when he was a baby. They are remarkable! My only issue is that the songs are very catching and you will find yourself singing them while folding laundry.,1448236800,,299,4.172413793103448
6962602,5,B00S6R7494,"I use this program in my classroom for kids with developmental and cognitive delays.  I have kids with profound autism, Down's syndrome, and others with limited speech ability.  We started using this program this school year at the end of the day when everyone is tired and needs some ""down time"", kids and adults alike.  It's fun to watch, but also very educational for students, teacher, and paras.  It's amazing how many signs some of the kids have learned and how much more they are able to communicate.  They love it, and it's easy to grab their attention.  We use one DVD per week, watching it 5 times for about a half hour each day.  Then we switch DVDs on Monday. When we've watched three, we  take a week to ""review"" those first  three before we move on to a new topic.  It will be fun to see how much they know by the end of the year.  Me too!  I would highly recommend this for any kids, or even adults if you just want to learn some basic sign language.  I plan to give copies to relatives with babies for Christmas this year.",1446076800,6,1038,4.288659793814433

6962604,5,B00S6R7494,"So far we haven't gotten past the first few dvd's but we had purchased the first one a while ago and my 15 month old LOVES it. She's already signing a handful of signs like ""more"" & ""bird"" and the video is teaching her to speak as well!! Such a great purchase!!!",1444780800,,262,4.0576923076923075

6962630,5,B00S6R7494,"We have 4 videos from the Talking Hands and My Baby Can Talk series. While thise are okay for very basic signs, they are old and very repetitive. Signing Time is awesome! They use children to do most of the signing. Rachel explains how to do the signs and then the children sign so you and your child have more time to practice and see the signs being used. One of the main children is Rachel's daughter, Leah, who is deaf and uses ASL.

The songs are very helpful too. With the songs you learn some additional words and how to put things together. We are learning a lot more with Signing Time than we did with the other series.

I bought this series and the second one, along with sentences. We are still working on series one. I got a slightly better package deal on their website than buying them individually, but the individual series costs the same amount on their site as they do on amazon.

My daughter is 19 months old and she loves watching these DVDs. As soon as she heard the opening music she gets excited and looks at the TV, waiting for the video to start. I highly recommend Signing Time to anyone who is serious about learning ASL or simply helping your baby/toddler communicate with you. My daughter is able to tell me what she wants even if she cannot say the word yet. Sign language is helping her to learn to say new words as well. She is speaking at or above the level of a 2 year old.",1505001600,,1407,4.262172284644195

Rachel, Alex and Leah are a wholesome trio, it's really a joy as they entertain and teach many multiple levels of signs with their sing/song content.",1503100800,,306,4.7924528301886795

She has been asking to watch them instead of Disney Jr., which is typically the only thing she watches on TV.  The only draw back to the delivery of my DVDs was that the plastic rings holding all the DVDs together in the pack were broken when I opened the package.",1493856000,,347,4.40625

6962682,5,B00S6R7494,"We purchased Signing Time for our 18 month old daughter this past Christmas, after using Baby Signing Time for a year.  My first thought is that I liked Baby Signing Time better for its songs and more clear explanations, but Signing Time is still amazing. I also experienced a case with broken rings but it doesn't bother me. This is the only television we show her, and we had nearly worn the four Baby Signing Time DVDs out! I recommend copying the videos to the cloud to be able to get years of use. My daughter didn't really sign back to us until she was about 10 months. Once she started signing, for a little while she would only sign and it seemed her verbal skills barely made the cutoff at her pediatric appointments. She could sign 3-word sentences but only said a total of 7 words at 15 months.  But now at 20 months she signs nearly 100 signs, says the word for all of them, and even recognizably sings some of the songs. Also, her manners are amazing because we have had her signing 'please' and 'thank you' for over a year already. she automatically says 'thank you' when grandma hands her something. Realistically, I don't think this program would work nearly as well if we didn't sit with her and sign with her during just about every viewing, and use the signs throughout the day. Parental reinforcement is key. We consider it a family activity.",1485475200,21,1362,4.487903225806452
6962683,1,B00S6R7494,"I ordered once,  had to return it because the case was broken; the rings that hold the disc sleeves were snapped off. So I wasn't able to give as a Christmas gift.
Ordered a second time,  same situation.  Plus the case was damaged and some discs do not appear to be new.
I think you can purchase the same set from the Signing Time website for nearly the same price.
The convenience of Amazon does not make up for $165 worth of damaged products x2!",1483833600,2,447,4.235294117647059

6962685,3,B00S6R7494,Great DVDs but arrived all broken. They replaced it but the second one I got was crushed all around the DVD case. I've never had a problem with amazon shipping and for it to happen twice in round I think it must be the quality of the case. Should be must stronger for the price it costs,1480377600,2,286,4.035087719298246
6962686,5,B00S6R7494,My grandchildren love doing their sign language!!!! I want to purchase the rest of them soon!!!!,1475884800,,96,5.0625
6962697,5,B00S6R7494,A great investment for  your children are even for yourself. I am taking an ASL class at the college and I have been watching these videos and they have help me as well. I love the music the colors I love the fact that they use real children to use sign language. My two children have been running and now I can say that they are almost trilingual LOL. The package did have a tiny broken piece which would not hold the DVDs in place but I contacted the company and they are sending me a replacement. They have excellent customer service. I have now placed my order for the second series because I love you so much. I wish they came in Blu-ray. Are used to rent this from the public library but they never had all the cents and they are not very well taken care of for so it's good that I have my own set now I highly recommend it,1474502400,6,829,4.054878048780488
6962698,5,B00S6R7494,"I love this set.  I bought this set when my son was 3 months old and so far we've only covered the 1st CD. My plan is to keep doing the first CD with him until he starts signing back and then we'll progress. He's turning 6 months in a couple of months and has yet to sign. But, from talking to other mommy friends if we keep it up he'll start signing back and understanding the signs at around 9 months. I've watched the first 3 DVDs and the quality is pretty consistent. The signs are very well explained and i love that they use different babies to show you the sign because their little fingers often times look different than the lady's fingers. I also love that there's a review option. Since i've watched the first one over and over, I now just put it on review and it quickly goes through all of the sign on that CD without me sitting through the whole routine again.  If you think you'll be committed to teaching your kiddo how to sign i'd highly recommend the whole set. It's pretty pricey, IMO, so maybe try to register for it as a shower gift.",1464739200,4,1054,4.187192118226601
6962699,5,B00S6R7494,"We were/are huge fans of baby signing time with our first child, so much so the DVDs are nearly destroyed from overuse. So she is now 3 1/2 and little brother is about to turn one so we splurged on this set. It is nice that this has the basic signs she already knows so the little one will hopefully pick up on them. At first, I missed the cartoons and catchy songs like baby signing time but the 3 yr old doesn't care and is picking up the new signs so quickly. I also like that I don't have to deal with all individual DVD cases but the one these came is very cheap and already broke.",1463702400,,586,3.9745762711864407

6962703,5,B00S6R7494,"Not sure about this seller I just ordered. I am sure about signing time! To be honest I just wanted a show with kids in it when I turned it on netflix. My daughter was in a stage of LOVING other kids. I wanted a show with kids in it:) and was thrilled to see the diversity this one has. My daughter loved it! She wanted to watch it every day. I didn't really think she would get much more out of it. I thought she would need to be a bit older. She was 21/2 when she started watching and didn't talk much. After just a few days she was talking so much more AND signing! She is three now and still loves it, and is still signing everyday. If I let her watch tv I at least want it to be educational, and this has been the most educational show I have found. And it was an accident! I am super excited to get volume one. Netflix only has volume two. The price is a bit high but I will pay it!",1456272000,,888,3.8315217391304346
