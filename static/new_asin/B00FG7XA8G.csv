5990924,3,B00FG7XA8G,"I didn't know what to expect, because I had never heard of this movie and the description was vague. When the movie first started I thought it was another Dude Wheres My Car type of movie and I almost turned it off. I decided to see where it was going and it turned out to get better. I was a little unsure what the point or moral of the movie was because it really wasn't clear at the end. I gave it some thought and I believe this was a coming of age story, only that both of the characters were already adults (just naive/immature). So a better phrase would be that it was a wake up call movie. Both characters learn that the world isn't as bad/good as they thought it was.",1435536000,,676,4.090225563909774

5990928,3,B00FG7XA8G,"Kind of like a Sideways remake for 20 somethings. Lots of growing up for the main character, but no ""happy ending."" Nice set-up for a part 2 in Japan with the roles sort of reversed.",1412899200,,182,4.228571428571429

5990931,5,B00FG7XA8G,"I saw this film at the LA AFF and since then I've been waiting to get a chance to show it to my friends and family. I think it is a movie for young college students and up. It is probably not appropriate for anyone younger. Not being a movie buff I cannot give you much of a description on cinematography and fancy stuff, but I can say it was a funny and heart-felt movie. I'm happy that I can now share the awesomeness of this film with everyone I know.",1389744000,,454,4.0

5990934,4,B00FG7XA8G,I honestly thought this movie would be worse than it was. I was surprised on how much I enjoyed it. It has its extreme cringe worthy moments but they pass. I have a couple of other internal gripes about the film but there's no need for that here. If you're bored and want to watch a decent movie click play. Give it a try.,1463356800,,322,4.046875
5990935,4,B00FG7XA8G,"I didn't expect this movie to be amazing, but I'm interested in anything dealing with cultural identity, and this movie was surprisingly thoughtful and entertaining. It contains keen observations through realistic characters with flaws and realistic dialog--and some unrealistic dialog--but all more realistic than cliche Hollywood drivel. Most flaws can be chalked up to low budget and the small team making the movie, and you have to suspend your disbelief a bit when Naoto seems to understand all the natural colloquial English to move things along. Good character development and some modern stereotypes looked at in more depth. It's a fun watch with interesting insights into perspectives of the Japanese experience in America, the Asian-American experience young and old, male and female, and the ways people deal with life (or don't) through anger or venting on a vlog. I hope to find more movies like this that are a little different than the usual offerings.",1461974400,2,967,5.245161290322581

5990939,4,B00FG7XA8G,"What this is - is a moral lesson on the ways of a ""sophisticated"" society. A young country man is sent to the ""big city"" to acquire some polish - and instead sees first-hand the corruption, moral disintegration and callousness of a so-called ""modern"" society. He does not see - or is never given the opportunity - to see the varied other sides of modern society, but he returns a wiser young man on the deceptions and intrigues of a section of our society we would like to forget.",1448064000,,480,4.404494382022472
5990940,4,B00FG7XA8G,"Lmao truth bomb. Sebastian is kind of a dick, and by kind of, I mean massive, but his frustrations come off as honest and understandable. Plus, his ""be like Sake, my friend"" Bruce Lee mock-impression and scene with the racist cop are genius.",1445904000,2,241,4.627906976744186
5990941,1,B00FG7XA8G,"Very disappointing.  I had high hopes for an enjoyable film, but this one rehashed cliches and stereo-types of Asians in a not very creative or amusing way.  I think the filmmaker thought he was being candid and honest about the ideas presented but instead they were presented in an attempted comic form that did not work, primarily because the lead character, Sebastian (Eugene Kim), was such an fool. I watched the film alone and sometimes, watching Sebastian, made me embarrassed of myself for watching, but I have a ""no walking out"" rule about films so I soldiered on... Sebastian was so over the top that any credibility he might have had was lost within the first ten minutes or less, and even when he spoke of certain stereo-types, in an effort to debunk them, he came across as if he were using them only for humour and not in any instructive way.  The character of Naoto (Gaku Hamada) made  a gallant attempt at filling his role, but he was unbelievable in the role of someone assuming responsibility for a sake brewery.  He came across as a bewildered 12 year old playing the tagging along with an older cousin on a road trip.  The character of Joslyn (Marlane Barnes) was one of only two characters, of the main players, who came off well.  She filled her role nicely without the need to be overly idiotic (Sebastian) or unbelievably naif (Naoto).  She kept the film from going completely off the tracks, which is a feat considering how ridiculous the film was in general.  The character of Micheal (Josh Brodis) was also well-played (compared to Sebastian) but the ""humour/jokes"" directed at him by Sebastian were unnecessary and in poor taste, even in a film that meant to debunk stereo-types.  He and Joslyn made the film somewhat bearable, barely. Watch it for Joslyn and Michael, only if there is nothing else to watch.  And you're snowed in and cannot get to Blockbuster...(jk).",1442448000,,1895,4.746951219512195
8615491,2,B00FG7XA8G,"This was not good. It's sad really since I am always for more AAPI representation in media and there were so many great rough ideas found in this film yet were barely explored if at all.
While Sake Bomb attempted to address such topics as racism (from the outside as well as internalized), culture clashes between Asian-Americans vs Asians, etc, it's almost as if this movie ironically only reinforced such stereotypes. From the almost Long Duk Dong-ness of the Japanese cousin (whose dialogue was entirely unbelieveable. Really? Not even a brief exchange in Japanese between him and Sebastian?) to the almost bordering on MRA-type of misogyny from the main character, Sebastian, I'm not entirely sure what was the point the screenwriter was trying to get across.  I was waiting for some kind of pivotal moment for the lead that never truly happened. Some would argue that it was the scene between him and Joselyn that was to be the turning point but it only served to reinforce Sebastian's borderline self-victimization.
I really, really wanted to root for this film but it's directionless. There was no point to Sebastian's homophobia.  There was no addressing of Sebastian's misogyny and how it is a greater problem among Asian American men.  This film painted itself in such broad strokes as if it was trying to please everyone yet it failed doing so.  I came away watching this having gained no new insight that hasn't been addressed before in other forms of media.
In the future, it might be beneficial for the screenwriter to maybe not rely so much on anecdotal or personal experience and try to get a more varied perspective of the AAPI experience if he chooses to broach these kinds of topics again.",1514419200,,1708,4.859106529209622

8615493,3,B00FG7XA8G,"This was a bit slow at first and the acting was a little forced and over-the-top (Sebastian), but the story had some value in reality in the interactions between Asians and other races. I think my having seen many subbed Japanese movies, characters often lack depth in movies vs J-dramas which can be from 8-12, 90-minute episodes and this movie followed that pattern.  I've never met an Asian-American as angry as Sebastian, but some of what he was saying I've heard before.  I watched it mainly because Gaku Hamada was starring in it and he was in one of my favorite Japanese movies called Fish Story, you should find a subbed version of that one if you can. I think this movie also had a good story to tell and it was solid once it got moving, but don't expect Oscar performances. Definitely worth a watch though.",1502841600,,816,4.54421768707483
8615494,1,B00FG7XA8G,"i skipped through so many many scenes and every scene i stop at, vulgar language &/or imagery. i can't say the sweet ending was worth any of the rest of the movie.",1501200000,,163,4.125
8615495,4,B00FG7XA8G,"A surprisingly good film! It took a while before it pulled me in but once I gave it a chance I was beginning to see why it has won awards. The characters feel overly stereotyped at first but become more three dimensional and begin to show subtleties that move the story along. I've read some criticism of the language barrier being a little too flimsy. While this is true, it certainly isn't a fault unique to this film. Many Hollywood movies do the same simply because you have to choose your battles. it isn't worth dwelling on that reality when you have a story to tell, and if the story weren't as good I might have a problem with that too. While some might find the stereotypes a bit much, in reality there are people who really do behave this way, as anyone on social media is aware. So I found the film believable and an interesting commentary on society and cultural differences. I have spent a lot of time in Japan and also enjoy independent films. This film, quietly and in an understated way has its own unique take on cultural identity, youth culture and learning life lessons.",1498867200,,1089,4.477386934673367
8615496,3,B00FG7XA8G,"There's nothing really likeable about this film.  The acting is not believable, I had a hard time accepting that Naoko had never been to America as his accent is actually too fluent.  He doesn't make the same pronunciation mistakes that most native Japanese would.  The script is rather weak as it paints Sebastian as this cringe-worthy whiny narcissistic asian-american male with a chip on his shoulder that comes off really overbearing and at times cartoonish.  If you're looking at a nuanced look at the culture clash between Asian Americans and their foreign born counterparts, this film doesn't bring any of that.  Instead of trying understand why there is a differnce, all it does it delve into stereotypes that reinforces misunderstandings.  Not a terrible film, but best served as background noise with occasional glancing into paying attention to the plotline.  It really had a chance to bring something new, however it just treads old territory.",1497657600,,955,5.162337662337662
