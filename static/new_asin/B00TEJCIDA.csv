8701356,1,B00TEJCIDA,"The story was a bit cliche but had some interesting twists and was probably the most redeemable part in the movie given the quality of the rest of the aspects.
I was rather impressed with how she worked the movie and time elapsing. You could follow the characters seeing days going by in a relatively short movie which I found to be rather impressive.
The sound needed some work but likely was a result of a low-budget. The special-effects seem to be the result of trying to make a blockbuster with a limited budget. I could tell that she was trying to do something really cool with the special effects but it looks like the special effects were not implemented well which hurt the quality.
If there is a sequel I hope Michele takes the criticisms constructively.",1431734400,2,763,4.576642335766423
8701357,1,B00TEJCIDA,"I agree with the other one star. Just because this is a first time effort, does not give it a pass for being bad. The price is WAY TOO HIGH as well. I have seen all of Michele Plunkett's work and it carries the same theme of amateur stink through it all. After your first production you're supposed to learn from your mistakes, however, Plunkett Productions continues to put out garbage without any hint of getting better, learning the craft, or even respecting the art enough to improve.

Give it up and get a real job. But I do give credit for at least having the courage and the fortitude to make the film. But in this industry, you're simply just not going to make it on such mediocrity. Sorry, someone had to be real and tell you the truth.",1427241600,,745,4.321428571428571
8701358,4,B00TEJCIDA,"This movie is great movie for a low to no budget production by a first time artist.  The story is fabulous.

Yes, there are a few things that could use some refinement such as sound, in a few scenes some of the actors are a little tough to hear.

These actors are all also amateurs, even Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie started somewhere.

Over all for an up and coming producer and performers who are all trying to break into a cut throat industry the movie is, again, well done all things considered.  You try making a full film with no funding and non-Hollywood equipment.",1427155200,2,572,4.40952380952381
8701359,4,B00TEJCIDA,Very impressive for a first time movie director. It needs some work but all and all very artistic. Good work!,1427068800,3,109,4.5
8701360,3,B00TEJCIDA,Not bad for a first time movie and a with a low budget. Need some work on sound. Great effort with acting.,1427068800,2,106,3.8636363636363638
8701361,1,B00TEJCIDA,Awful. Just God awful. Not one bit of talent in front or behind the camera.,1426982400,,75,4.066666666666666
