8418656,5,B0048EH5SE,"discovered the beck series awhile back and purchased the entire set at that time.  found out there were newer releases and purchased them, stormens oga being one of them.  if you are familiar with the series, this is an exciting addition to have in your library.  it is fast paced, exciting and has the usual twists and turns.  there are four additional episodes out there, but they are not available to american audiences and the subtitles are only in swedish.  we are huge fans of peter haber, mikael persbrandt and the tv series and hope they will become available as well.  it is so worth purchasing a region free dvd player with pal and ntsc capability so that you can watch region 2 as well as any other region dvds with no problem.

update: 10/16 the latest episodes are/were available at mhz which i purchased immediately.  subtitles are in english.",1453334400,,857,4.666666666666667
8418657,5,B0048EH5SE,"Non-US DVD format.  Very well done highly styled mini-movie.  Aggressively paced.  Does not follow normal BECK storyline, but does not suffer at all as a result.  Highlights a Swedish issue; light touch at first, but a bit heavy handed at the end.  One of the best BECK shows I have watched.",1388966400,2,291,4.627450980392157
