8543656,4,B009POABJC,The instructions on this DVD are very good. It is very difficult for an instructor on a DVD to coach to every variable on a sporting clays course so the video teaches good principles that can be applied but won't coach to to break every clay presentation perfectly.,1453507200,,265,4.541666666666667
8543657,3,B009POABJC,"The presentation was done well and Lieske has his own system that works for him. This was the first ""shooting video"" I have purchased and probably the last. I have been shooting for forty years and have had  good success at trap shooting but thought some tips on sporting clays would be in order. The price for these video's is too much money when you can get all kinds of instruction and help from places like youtube.",1374451200,,419,4.441558441558442
8543658,5,B009POABJC,"Very easy to follow instruction by a great teacher. Took lessons from Pat several years ago, but wanted to see what new
I could learn. Systematic in title is what the video is all about. Pat simply outlines a systematic way to approach
shooting sporting clays. Would recommend Pat as a teacher and as a producer of videos on sporting clays.",1367107200,,340,4.590163934426229
8543659,4,B009POABJC,"Simple but effective approach to Sporting Clays.  Well worth the time and money. Not the best production quality but,again, worth the effort.  Pat Lieske knows what he's talking about.",1361232000,,184,5.310344827586207
8543660,5,B009POABJC,"I have watched many different sporting clays videos and this is one of the best.  Lieske's methodical approach to each target is easy to understand and repeatable for the student.  He begins the DVD by explaining his method and then applies it throughout the DVD on single targets, report pairs and true pairs.  There is also a question and answer section at the end of the DVD.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1359849600,,414,4.63013698630137
