8187792,1,6305280150,I have no clue what they tried to do with this movie but they messed it up bad. First off the movie has sex and music no talking what so ever. The sex scenes weren't even that good. It was like listening to music but you can't  hear. This movie was a complete waste of time and money. There are way  better movies on the market. If I had the option I wouldn't pay a dollar  for this movie. It should be a free giveaway with groceries or something,959299200,20,446,3.9887640449438204
