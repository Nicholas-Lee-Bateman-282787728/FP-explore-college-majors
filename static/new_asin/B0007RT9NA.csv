2240569,5,B0007RT9NA,"I have to admit that I only got into this show recently but the first three series are a knockout.  I would highly recommend any of the first three series to put on during a cold night to relax.

The acting is brillant, the scripts are funny.  I do not think that there is a bad episode in either series.

You won't regret purchasing this item.  They can be watched over and over again.  Trust me, I have...",1123632000,,407,4.153846153846154

2240571,5,B0007RT9NA,"i've been watching this sitcom on tv and was instantly hooked.  i can sometimes relate to debra, unfortunately!  hahaha!  but this is an extremely funny show and it's not all about laughs, but about relationships as well.  it usually has some kind of moral in the end.  all the actors play their roles perfectly.  you'll also see how the show developed. the first few episodes were not as funny, it was as if they were still ""building"" their characters, but after the 4th or 5th, they just sunk into the roles like they were playing themselves.

there is really no other sitcom like it, i can't think of a single family sitcom that can come close to everybody loves raymond.  what can i say?  i'm a big fan!  it is a really great dvd set for a good price, too!  i can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out.  buy it, quick!",1121990400,,831,4.290322580645161
2240572,5,B0007RT9NA,"This was quite possibly the funniest show on television. Now in syndication, it was the funniest sitcom that CBS aired during NBC's ""must see tv"" era. In my opinion, this is the best sitcom to come along since Sienfeld. I purchased my copy of the first three seasons for $69.99 brand new, plus a free one year subscription to TV Guide. I am extremely happy with my purchase, and HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with a pulse.",1121990400,,432,4.551282051282051
2240573,5,B0007RT9NA,"Excellent deal on a hilarious show. The first three seasons contain episodes that are not shown enough in syndication. Since we don't have cable, TV shows on DVD are the next best thing. Buy all three seasons!",1121817600,,209,4.675675675675675
2240574,5,B0007RT9NA,The product arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was in perfect condition.  I LOVE it!!  This is a comedy that everyone with a family can relate to.  I can always count on Ray for a good laugh.,1121126400,,199,4.051282051282051
2240575,5,B0007RT9NA,"This show is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen (next to Friends and Will and Grace). It is about Ray, a newspaper columnist, living with his family, and his intrusive parents live across the street.  Deborah is Ray's wife. She constantly needs to balance her own three kids and a husband. It is much harder for her when Marie keeps sub-consciously insulting Deborah's cleaning, cooking, and parenting. If you watch the show, you know what to expect when she reacts to things.  Marie is Ray and Robert's overbearing mother. Whenever she gets in people's way, her excuse is ""I do it for love"".  Frank is the most blunt, couch-potatolike,  and one of the most funniest characters I have ever watched. He keeps calling Marie a nag and the most contact he has with her is when Marie is told by Frank ""Make me: eggs, a sandwich, bacon, steak, and other foods. Marie doesn't mind at all. Frank and Marie are what you call a ""dysfunctional loving family"". The one left out is Robert. He's Ray's brother. He works as a police officer in the NYPD. Everytime he comes home with good news, Ray trumps that and gets all of the attention. These two are usually seen competeing for their parents attention. Whenever Deborah wants Ray and/or Robert that their parents (Frank and Marie) are doing something wrong, the two sons always come up with a reason to not tell them that they are doing something wrong.(For example: Marie comes over to Ray's house everyday, Marie continues to control the family without knowing it.",1119139200,9,1514,4.680451127819549
2240576,5,B0007RT9NA,"just starting to watch this series on swedish cable tv and i love it. The caracters are perfect and this shwow, the office and seinfeld are the funniest tv shows i have ever seen.",1118707200,4,179,4.294117647058823

8051150,5,B0007RT9NA,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows on TV. Each character is so distinct and will probably remind you of somebody in your own family. Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",1257206400,,416,4.791666666666667

8051153,1,B0007RT9NA,"I don't know who actually produced the DVD manufacturing for HBO/CBS, but they need to recall all the DVD's and replace them.  The quality of the DVD's, especially on Disc 1, the Pilot is worse than pirated copies from VHS.

I love the show.  I always have and always will, but my Raymond fix will have to be satisfied with reruns from TV.  I have several other television series bought from Amazon and they've all been exceptional.  But the ELR collection is scratchy, grainy, out of focus, washed-out colors, and the DVD playback stutters and hangs.

The one star is for the production quality only, not the show or customer service.  Amazon processed and delivered in the usual grade-A manner.  So none of this is Amazon's fault.  I'll continue to buy, but I may be a little more careful in the future before buying a DVD series produced by or for HBO/CBS.

Keep in mind, though, that the Hogan's Heroes is CBS, but it is Paramount/CBS.  Its quality is superb, so the key is HBO video.

If you don't mind putting up with the glitches above, go ahead and get this series.  Otherwise, watch it on reruns or wait for CBS to get someone other than HBO video to produce it.",1128556800,2,1171,4.492890995260663
8051154,4,B0007RT9NA,"The show is a good one, Our first disk seemed a little dark, the second disk seemed ok. It's a fun show to watch especially with no commercials. Only 22 min. per episode. Makes it easy to watch even for the busy person.",1126051200,,219,4.116279069767442
8051155,5,B0007RT9NA,"The three season set is an exceptional value especially as a first purpchase on the Amazon credit account.

The episodes are full of fun and foibles we all can see in our families or mirrors.  Laughing at the Barone family is as much about laughing at yourself.  The humor is borne of genuine familial angst though not without compassion and the occasional spark of the human spirit rising above the temptation to eat our young.  The truly paranoid will look for the surveilance devices the writers use in our own homes to inspire their story lines.  Those less inclined to hysteria will sit back and enjoy the chance to see humor in their own lives and be content to know the names have been changed to protect the innocent.",1125446400,,725,4.589147286821706
8051156,5,B0007RT9NA,"This is one of the few shows that both my husband & I enjoy to watch.  Usually we're spatting over who will get the remote each night, but when one of us ""finds"" Raymond on t.v., we both settle in for a half-hour of stomach-splitting laughs!

For those of you who have never seen Everbody Love Raymond, it's about a 40-something husband & wife, and the trials & tribulations of family life - especially when your parents/in-laws live right across the street!

Raymond is the type of guy that just can't seem to get it right.  Plus, he'll do anything not to get into trouble with his wife & mother - yet it seems that that's what ALWAYS happens in the end.  Don't get me wrong, he deserves the trouble he finds himself in, as he tends to quite devious when he needs to be.

Deborah, his ""poor"" wife, has to deal with Raymonds antics, as well as the stress of trying to please an unpleasable mother-in-law who shows up at her house at all hours of the day or night.

Then there's the mother/mother-in-law who can't mind her own business, and the problems this causes with Raymonds & his wife.

Next is the brother/brother-in-law who's a really nice guy, but he has some problems of his own.  He's also in his 40's, but isn't married & doesn't have any children.  Of course his mother can't stand this fact, and does everything she can to get him to ""make her some grandchildren"".

Last is the father/father-in-law who acts like he hates being married to his wife, but you can always tell that there really is love between them - although you may have to dig deep to find it sometimes.  He's what might be considered a ""grumpy old man""...

Overall, this is a great comedy with a perfect cast!  I think it's so well liked because most of us can see ourselves in 1 or more of these characters, or at least we can sympathize with the issues at hand.

If you're looking for a comedy show that the whole family will enjoy, then this should fit the bill.  I highly recommend it!",1124582400,7,1969,4.3829201101928374
8051157,5,B0007RT9NA,"Its a great show!  My wife really liked it before we got married.  I had hardly even heard of it.  I got this for her for our one year anniversary and she was thrilled.  Its such a funny show, I'd definately watch it over and over again.

It has interesting situations where the families' tolerance for each other is tested, but no matter how insensitive they are to each other they still love each other.  Ray and Deborah have interesting issues as well.  It helps to look at the two of them to know what not to say.

Its a good buy, a funny show, just don't try to pattern your marriage off of them.",1124496000,,601,4.165217391304348
