8413652,3,B0042FUHRU,"I can never bring myself to completely smash a UFC event. A lot of people out there will get mean and nasty because a certain event lacked, and at times they do. But in all reality, I don't think they ever completely suck. And in all honesty, they all have their memorable moments. There is a reason for FIGHT OF THE NIGHT, KNOCK OUT OF THE NIGHT, and SUBMISSION OF THE NIGHT. Unless, of course, there is no KO or submission. But usually, those are the awards given.

Spike TV chose to show this, so it was free for UFC fans, at least in the US.

At UFC 120 at the o2 Arena, English fans were expecting some great fights. And as their Main Event, their own Michael ""The Count"" Bisping was set to square off with Yoshihiro ""Sexiyama"" Akiyama. Bisping won TUF 3, and has had a great run in the UFC, only being knocked out once by Dan Henderson. A lot of people didn't feel like Akiyama deserved a Main Event spot, being merely 1-1 in the UFC. His debut at UFC 100 was Fight of the Night against Alan Belcher, and he won a very controversial split decision. At UFC 116, he took on Chris Leben, and after a hard fought war, got caught in a submission that lost him the fight. Is he truly ready for Michael Bisping?

In the Co-Main Event, you have another of England's own, Dan ""The Outlaw"" Hardy taking on Carlos ""The Natural Born Killer"" Condit. Hardy already fought for the title against GSP at UFC 111, and he's had some wars in the UFC. Condit knows what it means to go to war, and he wanted Dan Hardy for this match, and he wanted Hardy in his homeland. Is Condit nuts? We'll find out.

We also have Mike Pyle taking on John Hathaway. Hathaway surprised a lot of fans at UFC 114, dominating the original Ultimate Fighter, Diego Sanchez. Pyle has fought a who's who of MMA talent.

So, what makes or breaks UFC 120? I'll say this much. There are 10 fights on this card, and I'll list 'em below.

James McSweeney vs. Fabio Maldonado: You always know that McSweeney is ready for a war, and he's moved down to Light Heavyweight for this one. His opponent is more than game for this match-up, and after an exciting battle, a 3rd round TKO wraps things up. This could've been substituted for one of the fights Spike featured, and I'll have a note or 2 on that in a fight or 2 that I list down the line.

Spencer Fisher vs. Curt Warburton: When the warrior in you TKO's TUF Winner, Ross Pearson, then you get a stiff test in your UFC debut! Spencer Fisher hopes he still has it against the newcomer from the UK. Both men come to fight, and a unanimous decision is awarded in the end.

Paul Sass vs. Mark Holst: You have a veteran of MMA who made his debut against John Gunderson, hoping for UFC win #1, and he's won by submission and TKO. Paul Sass isn't afraid to pull guard, and he loves his triangle! Don't believe me? Check out the kid's record. It ends with a 1st round SUBMISSION OF THE NIGHT, and I'll let YOU guess which submission was applied!

Rob Broughton vs. Vinicius Queiroz: English MMA fans know all about ""The Bear"" they call Broughton, who is possibly England's best Heavyweight out there. He takes on a tough Brazilian, and after a hard fought battle, a 3rd round submission ends a good fight! Now, I will say this. Queiroz came to fight in the UFC, and he fought in the UFC. He got tapped out in the UFC. But he also tested positive for Stanozolol, and was immediately released from the UFC. Don't be stupid! He could've been a force in the UFC's Heavyweight division.

Cyrille Diabate vs. Alexander Gustafsson: Here's my footnote from the first fight I listed above. I can easily see why this fight was substituted for the Wilks/Patrick fight on the Main Card when Spike replayed it for the fans. It was a great scrap, and it ended with a 2nd round submission!

James Wilks vs. Claude Patrick: Wilks did win TUF, but he really hasn't been that impressive in the big show so far. He won by submission to win the TUF Crown, and he beat Peter Sobotta at UFC 115. Claude Patrick made his debut at UFC 115, and he did impress, submitting Ricardo Funch. This is a fight that was dominated, but it really wasn't an exciting battle. And as I said above, I can easily see why it was replaced with Diabate/Gustafsson once it aired on Spike TV.

Cheick Kongo vs. Travis Browne: To be said lightly, Cheick Kongo should've been disqualified for his stunts and antics in this fight! Travis Browne came to fight a big name in the sport, and Kongo repeatedly grabbed at his shorts, with only one point being deducted! It was a DRAW. Come on!

John Hathaway vs. Mike Pyle: This was an impressive performance, and I didn't figure it would've been dominated, but for the most part, it was! Unanimous decision.

Dan Hardy vs. Carlos Condit: I think a lot of eye-balls popped out of a lot of heads when this one ended. What a KO! 1st round, stunning, and worth seeing!

Michael Bisping vs. Yoshihiro Akiyama: They came to fight, and put on FIGHT OF THE NIGHT. And the right man won a unanimous decision!

So, in the end, there were some ups and downs in this one. But not a total loss. I did enjoy a lot of it, and can watch those fights again pretty easily.",1324339200,,5152,4.33991683991684
8413653,3,B0042FUHRU,"There was a lot of mumblings from people when the card for UFC 120 was announced, not least from the 17,000 people who paid for tickets before any fight was announced, their main grumbling being the lack of a marquee name of course the main reason for this is that with the event being held in England is that it would not be shown till later that night in the U.S due to the time difference and the UFC generally don't put international events on pay per view, so they were hardly going to get a Brock Lesnar or Anderson Silva to headline the card.

What they got instead was their fellow country men in the two main events, the well known Dan ""The Outlaw"" Hardy vrs Carlos Condit in what turns out to be an edge of your seat fight! In the main event the very well known Michael Bisping battled Japanese and International superstar Yoshihiro Akiyama in what was fight of the night. Rising English fighter John Hathaway fresh of the biggest win of his career against Diego Sanchez fights welterwight veteran Mike Pyle. As you can now see the theme is British fighters against fighters from the rest of the world. Even the heavyweight clash between American Travis Browne and France's Cheick Kongo is considered U.K Vrs U.S.A as Kongo trains with the english team called Wolfslair thats home to Michael Bisping and Quinton Jackson. The last fight on the main card is between England's James Wilks and Canada's Claude Patrick.

As per usual with UFC DVD's nowadays you get loads of extras including all the pre lim fights that includes a lot of English fighters, so despite a lot of people thinking of this as a throwaway event there is some good stuff on here and is better than some of the American events we get, just goes to show you don't always need big names to create an exciting event!",1299196800,,1792,4.510769230769231
