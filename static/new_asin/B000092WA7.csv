7988638,5,B000092WA7,"After the Atomic destruction a hand full of people find them selves in a valley that escaped the initial radiation. Naturedly the mix is of innocent and not so innocent women and men. This is not just any valley it was especially picked by a survivalist that expected the big one to be dropped and scoped out a valley with lots of lead around them.

Slowly encroaching on them is a strange mutant that has physic powers. Like the mutated monkeys on the atoll where they tested the bomb, this is probably the new generation of people replacements. Luckily he (it) still has a hankering for blonds in swimsuits.

There is also the possibility of contaminated rain bringing radiation to the valley.

One of the fun scenes in this Rodger Corman movie is when they throw a dummy off the cliff and you are supposed to believe it is a blond.",1504742400,7,834,4.509933774834437
7988639,5,B000092WA7,"As a boy, this was one of those films I saw late at night that scared the bejeezus out of me. I even had nightmares about it.  Seeing it again, it still worked on me, recalling my fears of ""radiation"", nuclear war, hostile mutants.

As this is so old, I will not attempt to avoid spoilers, but give a review as hard scifi.  The story begins in the aftermath of a nuclear war, with a hard, taciturn man talking to his daughter.  A survivalist with inside knowledge about what radiation exposure can do, his house was shielded from radioactive fallout by the lead in the surrounding hills.  As other characters stumble upon the enclave, he at first wants to keep them out, but his daughter convinces him to share their provisions.  One arrival has carried a man horribly mutated by the fallout, who is the link to the world beyond the hills.  Though the mutant seems to be losing his mind, it is clear he is evolving in a new direction - he prefers to eat raw meat and regularly goes hunting; he appears sweaty and ugly.  There is also a criminal type (the actor who was Mannix) and his floozy girlfriend.

As provisions start to run out, the occupants of the house grow desperate, fighting among themselves to the point of murder.  There are also incursions from the outside, including a starving mutant who warns that there are many stronger than himself; their observations of him as he expires are horrible, such as his clawed hands, slimy  ""atomic"" skin, and deformed feet.  The next day, his carcass is discovered eaten - whatever it is out there will not shrink from consuming human flesh.

The daughter, who lost her fiancee but likes the good guy, feels she is being called by someone, perhaps someone she knows, who keeps himself off screen.  In the climax, the creature (in a hilariously clunky costume) comes for her, but dies when clean rain - washes the contamination away for good.  The surviving couple walk over the hills into the regenerating world, where other survivors have been heard on the radio.

This is really good hard scifi with elements of horror as the radiation creates mutants.  I was terrified at the mutant's feverish monologue about ""wonderful things are happening out there"", as if an entire new, savage ecosystem was evolving.  It carried the most haunting, filthy vision.

Warmly recommended for the sake of nostalgia and diehard fans of 50s scifi.",1444089600,,2384,4.701204819277108

7988641,2,B000092WA7,"The movie title, has nothing to do with movie, It's about a women who is hired as a school Psychiatrist (Nastassja Kinski) running after a boy, (who has strange powers), who's mom was impregnated by an male alien,(we Don't See this) who comes back to earth to reclaime his boy, but takes out revenge against those people, who abused him, and kills them off one by one. In the mean time, the boy has flash backs, that lets us see what happened to mom, while dad, (Randy Quaid) trys to hide the secret. from the new Doctor, with the rest of the town's people.

7988642,3,B000092WA7,"DAY THE WORLD ENDED (1955) is the fifth and last film helmed by Roger Corman in that year, his first as a director.  Obviously they were all cheap and quickly-shot films, and much of this film betrays that.  Interestingly enough it's shot wide - in Superscope, a 2.35:1 aspect ratio format that duplicates Cinemascope - but it is otherwise strictly B, or even C-grade science fiction-horror, fairly typical of the period in most respects.

Basically it's the story of seven survivors of a nuclear holocaust, gathered together and fighting amongst themselves as they struggle to survive - in a nice ranch house in a bowl-shaped valley somewhere near San Francisco.  Jim, a middle-aged man, and Louise his cute blonde daughter inhabit the house, and Jim at first intends to get rid of anyone who troubles their existence, but Louise prevails upon him and they're quickly joined by Rick, a handsome geologist (and instantly recognizable as the likely hero); the duo of Tony (apparently a small-time criminal and all-around scumbag) and his stripper girlfriend Ruby; Pete, an old prospector (I kid you not) with a mule named Diablo; and Radek, a guy dying from radiation sickness with glowing crap on his face.  Now the food that Jim had for two will have to go seven ways (well, six as they soon find that Radek doesn't eat anymore), and Jim will have to learn to trust somebody (guess who) to help keep his daughter - and the supply of food and weapons - safe.

Though the acting is pretty bad generally - Richard Denning as Rick and Paul Birch as Jim fare the best, and they're merely competent and both sound like they're lecturing the stupid audience half the time - and the sets and production design awfully cheap, Corman keeps this moving and makes it reasonably fun to watch as the small group disappears or has ""accidents"" one by one.  Eventually we find out why Radek doesn't need to eat, and what's making the odd noises at night - and what happened to the people who didn't make it down into the lead-ore shielded valley.  It just wouldn't be complete without a rubber monster - and, being the 1950s, it also just wouldn't be complete without a moralizing Christian message which however seems a bit uneasily tacked on - there's  a funny sequence where Jim basically says that they are the future of the human race, and the women will have to start making babies; after which he almost immediately offers Louise up in marriage to Rick.  They might be the only humans left, but separate beds and Christian marriage are still essential!

The science of course is silly - the tagline I used for my review gives you an idea - and the interactions between the characters aren't much more realistic (honestly, you'd think that they'd shoot Tony - or at least keep him tied up - after not one but multiple attempts on his part to ""take over""), but all in all it ends up being fairly fun, and Corman's direction is at least competent throughout.  The VHS suffers from being full-frame of course, but interestingly, as a couple of other reviews mention, the top-bottom framing is off, which wouldn't be improved with the widescreen DVD.  The compositions aren't exactly spectacular in any case.  Basically this is better than some of it's low budget competition, and a sign I think that Corman even at this stage while still in his 20s had more of an idea of where he was going than a lot of the other behind the scenes talent working on this kind of material.",1268524800,,3460,4.6694078947368425
7988643,2,B000092WA7,"Although perhaps provocative at the time, The Day the World Ended (1955) is probably of most interest today, as an early directorial effort by Roger Corman.  The film is a rather lukewarm tale of survival, that features some faulty science, mild melodrama, and a silly monster.

After a nuclear disaster has apparently wiped out civilization, survivors begin to turn up at a small house in an unnamed rural location.  Eventually Jim Maddison (Paul Birch) and his daughter Louise (Lori Nelson), take five strangers into their home.  Maddison has a gun, which helps to keep everyone in line, except that Tony Lamont (Mike Connors), one of his unwelcome guests, has a gun too.  Things gets tense, but Rick (Richard Denning), another survivor, steps in to keep things peaceful, at least for the moment.

The film's basic premise of surviving a nuclear event is pretty shaky.  Back in the 50's, most Americans were aware that the best protection from nuclear fallout, was an underground fallout shelter, but Maddison, who says he has been preparing for disaster for ten years, does not have one.  He has some provisions, but the additional guests mean his supplies, won't last as long.  Somehow he has electrical power, and monitors his shortwave for news, and uses a Geiger counter to test radiation levels.  They may be in a `desperate' situation, but the survivors do almost nothing productive, living without any urgent concerns, and wandering outdoors without taking any special precautions.  Lamont's interest in Louise irritates his companion Ruby (Adele Jergens), and his animosity towards Maddison and Rick, also creates tension, that eventually causes violence to erupt.

One of the group named Radek (Paul Duboy), is a victim of radiation exposure.  He wanders in the woods, eating wild game exposed to radiation, and says that there are others like him up in the mountains, and that those in the house will all be dead soon.  There is evidence that creatures are coming closer to the house, yet the survivors continue to wander about carefree.  In the film's special effects 'highlight', Louise and Rich have a rather feeble encounter, with one of the radiation affected mutants.

The post nuclear disaster scenario is one with enormous potential, but this early attempt fails to come close to reaching it.  Devoid of almost any scientific fact, it plays more like a combination soap opera and monster flick, rather than an apocalyptic adventure.  Richard Denning (Hawaii 5-0) who appeared in such science fiction notables as Target Earth (1954), and The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), probably gives the best performance.  Mike Connors who would later become a primetime star in Mannix, lays it on pretty thick, as a selfish cad.  There is bad science fiction that is still very entertaining, but this film probably isn't in that category.  If you are interested in viewing it, the film occasionally runs on AMC.",1264204800,,2928,5.07098121085595
7988644,3,B000092WA7,"There's not a dull moment in this dopey, post-apocalyptic creation of Roger Corman.  In fact, let the dizzyingly disjointed dialogue distract you for more than a nanosecond, and you'll discover that rewinding by remote is a requisite for even the flimsiest comprehension of this unintentional farce.
The sets are Ed-Woodsian and the science backwoodsian.  The script is so scattershot that it sounds as if the lines were shaken up in a hat and reassembled at utter random.  The mostly competent actors struggle to seriously project their portrayals (and probably to keep a straight face), though some revel in dishy characterizations that are perfect for the purple prose and sodden melodrama that bespeak them.  Mike Connors, as a (non-drinking, non-smoking) gunsel, and Adele Jergens as his shopworn floosy, keep the static snapping with their squabbling and showy antics.  And Paul Birch and Richard Denning, as the heroic mainstays of the story, make for sardonic smiles with their stoic demeanors and no-nonsense delivery of dialogue.
The plot has more holes than a bombed-out building.  But don't think about it till the flick's end (deemed The Beginning), or you'll lose what train of thought you're able to maintain.  Then, maybe you can deduce how an old desert rat could concoct hooch from cups of sugar cubes pilfered from a closet of closely controlled and rationed foodstuffs!",1245801600,,1389,5.201793721973094
