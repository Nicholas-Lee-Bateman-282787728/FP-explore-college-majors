7846241,5,6303416586,"I purchased this DVD, so that I could have a copy in my collection of the book called  ""My Antonia"" by Willa Cather.  I studied this Book in my senior year of high school many years ago.  When I gave birth to my daughter, I named her Antonia  because I thought that the name was so beautiful.  When the book came out as a picture, it brought back many memories, so I had to have a copy for my files.",1504569600,,399,3.9375
7846242,5,6303416586,This is an excellent movie for seniors. We read the book and then watched the movie. It really enhances the story of Willa Cather's My Antonia.,1489449600,,143,4.538461538461538
7846243,3,6303416586,"My main complaint about this DVD, as a DVD, is that it is a straight transfer from video and was not remastered.  Consequently, it was fuzzy and seemed slightly out of focus.  I also noticed changes to Cather's text, for example, Jim's grandfather was not depicted as in the book, where he was a vastly more sympathetic character.  I agree with other reviewers who took exception to the romance between Jim and Antonia:  that is not in the book.  As ""My Antonia"" is such an important American novel, in which one does get a real sense of life in 1880's Nebraska, I think the book deserved a more faithful adaptation - and the DVD version should have been remastered.  As it is, we are left with a mediocre DVD of a less than satisfactory adaptation of a fine, poignant novel.  Like other reviewers, I urge people to read Cather's memorable novel.",1487548800,,846,4.562913907284768

7846245,5,6303416586,The movie presented a synopsis of the novel but still held closely to the main theme of the story.,1420934400,,98,4.2105263157894735
7846246,4,6303416586,"Have not yet viewed this, but received excellent service.  A wonderful story of life on the Nebraska prairie in early 1900s.",1365811200,,124,4.904761904761905
7846247,4,6303416586,Enjoyable and engaging.  A view of the early settlement of the American heartland.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie.,1363651200,,142,4.875
7846248,1,6303416586,"This is one of the worst film adaptations of a book, overall, I have ever seen. For example, in Cather's novel, Jim's grandfather is an understanding peacemaker and appreciates Antonia's strength and independence. In the film, he's a grouchy snob who looks down on Antonia for being a foreign farmer! It's as if the writers never read the novel but instead scanned  badly-written crib notes. The only parts worth watching might be Jim and Lena during Jim's University days.",1142640000,10,473,4.987341772151899
7846249,1,6303416586,"If you have read Willa Cather's beautiful novel about her friend James Burden and his devotion to the immigrant girl he fell in love with at the turn of the 20th century, beware of this movie.  It only takes the romantic part of the book and makes James older from the start, incorporates fistfights, and makes the characters into different people than the ones you recognize in the book.

The poetic language of the story gets lost in a half-baked Cold Sassy Tree style, only worse.  At least Cold Sassy Tree maintained a bit of charm.  This film adaptation of Cather's work doesn't even maintain its dignity, and Jason Robards, unfortunately, couldn't even save it.  All you will recognize from the book is some of the dialog when the writers felt like using it, and the main characters' names.  Just like To Dance with the White Dog, this is another TV movie brought to video that violates a great novel and should be put out of its misery.  Skip it and read the book as it is far more rewarding.",1121990400,10,999,4.516666666666667
7846250,1,6303416586,"In our opinion, many parts of the movie were portrayed differently from how we pictured them in our minds.  The movie seemed to be trying to draw teenage viewers with unneccesary fighting and added romance, and it didn't really keep the spirit of the book.  Many key scenes and characters (i.e. Jake) were not included in the movie.  One scene that was very symbolic and important in the book was the rattlesnake scene, which was not included in the movie.  The plot was changed too, for example, Antonia and Jim got romantically involved in the movie, whereas in the book, Antonia thinks of Jim as a little brother.  Also, many of the characters' personalities in the movie were drastically changed from those in the book.  One of the things that we liked about the movie was the images of the cornfields and the winter prairie.  Overall, this movie was very disappointing and did not capture the feel of the book.",970358400,38,915,4.68125
