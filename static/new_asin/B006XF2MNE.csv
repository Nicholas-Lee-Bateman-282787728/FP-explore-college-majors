8506243,3,B006XF2MNE,"While I enjoy most anything at all that is associated with ""The Duke,"" I was a bit disappointed with this video.  I found myself fast-forwarding through much of it.  It was not what I thought it was going to be.  If you are looking for a biography video on John Wayne..... keep shopping.  This is not it!  It has some redeeming qualities, I suppose, but I found it mostly boring.  And the movies that are included were not to my tastes.  Sorry folks, I can't really recommend this one.",1337644800,,485,4.382022471910112
