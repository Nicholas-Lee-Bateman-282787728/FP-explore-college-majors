8501708,5,B006O94DHM,"The show builds to a head where the ultimate villian is revealed and scores are settled between various characters. It seems things are about to be fixed and the planet stabilized, but then...things start to happen? I felt this way as well when playing the game that the final fourth act was a drawn out excuse to pad the playing time. It feels less so in the animation and that is quite the feat. Lots of little foreshadowings and how events in the game are handled in the OVA make it seem that the final act isn't so forced and it just a natural exstention of the story. The battle between Arietta and Anise was exceptionally done, much better than what was presented in the game, made me actually feel for the character of Arietta all the more. She really did get a bum deal.",1370908800,,778,4.372413793103449
