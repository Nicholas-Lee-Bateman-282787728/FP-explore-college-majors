On this night, current super fight champion Maurice Smith was supposed to meet Mark Coleman for a rematch... that fell through. Then, Smith was slated to fight Dan ""The Beast"" Severn... that also fell through. The UFC put out a call for a challenger. David ""Tank"" Abbott answered the call to battle.

The night starts out with two less-than-stellar alternate bouts. In the first, Alex Hunter faces Harry Moskowitz. This is a lackluster fight that goes to a decision. Houston Dorr then takes on Dwayne Cason. This one ends more quickly, but it nearly as boring as the previous matchup.

Mark ""The Smashing Machine"" Kerr makes his UFC debut against Greg Stott. Stott looks like he's kidding, with his leaning stance and hand-to-hand combat style. Kerr ends it in 20 seconds. Goodbye, Greg Stott. Welcome, Mark Kerr.

Dave Beneteau v. Carlos Barreto: This one is fairly exciting, but either fighter can end it and the fight goes to a decision.

Vitor ""The Phenom"" Belfort v. Randy ""The Natural"" Couture: This is the true main event of UFC 18. Belfort had been tearing through the competition before this point in his young career (3-0 in the UFC). Couture is 34 at the time and Belfort is 20. Couture, however, makes this his fight. He uses his wrestling skills to control the flow of the bout. He imposes his will, begins landing standing blows and then eventually stops Belfort with strikes on the ground at just over 8 minutes. This was called an upset, but we know better by now.

Mark Kerr's then meets Dwayne Cason in the heavyweight tournament finals. This one ends very quickly and we have a repeat and very impressive heavyweight tournament champion.

In the main event, Maurice Smith faces off with Tank Abbott. We know who appears to be the better fighter in this bout - and we are correct... Smith is in good shape and Tank is not. Tank gasses and verbally quits. He chalks it up to coming from the bar stool to the octagon, but he was clearly outmatched and outclassed.

This is a decent UFC event. The highlight was definitely the Belfort/Couture fight. Couture is a class act and it is somewhat satisfying to see him stop The Phenom.",1152835200,,2205,4.703896103896104

7798401,2,1573624128,"I do not know what all of the hype about this UFC release was all about. None, none of the fights were spectacular.  Maybee they are to someone who is real into the specific technics or is a UFC trainspotter but to me (myself having no form of martial arts training) the fights were all fairly boring.  Call me shallow or whatever but I like to see action, and there was not a whole lot displayed, no blood.  I was very dissapointed by Vitor Belforts showing, all of the other things I have seen with him he was the man but not in XV.  I don't know maybe I am missing something, or its just that I like the first few UFCs where the octagon was covered in blood stains.  This was more like a wrestelling tournament with a few punches thrown.  Nothing like the older tournaments.  Well blood is lacking, so for all of you (like me) who really enjoy blood spurting all over the place and hitting the fans, this is not for you.  I may not be a purist but I know what I like, and this is not it. Go get 1-5 those are the best I think",988848000,,1028,4.054455445544554
7798402,4,1573624128,"Watch the heavyweight tournament to see why RIP (Airborne Ranger  hand-to-hand combat style) is the 'most expeditious' form of fighting in  the world.  Greg Stott should have spent more time training, and less time  reading a dictionary.  The Couture-Belfort match was a surprise.  Belfort  gained about 20+ pounds (of muscle) from UFC XII to now, which was less  than a year(mmm...steroids).  I don't think his conditioning was where it  should have been.  I guess with all his quick fights, he didn't think it  was necessary.  Pretty good Maurice Smith-Tank Abbott fight.  No surprises,  though.",965606400,2,597,5.202127659574468
7798403,5,1573624128,"The last UFC saw the greatest upset in MMA history,how odd was it to see it one-upped so soon.
One heavyweight tournament and 2 Superfights. This  is the event on paper, how it unfolded was something else. The heavyweight  tournament would see the return of Mark Kerr and his undefeated record  spanning different fighting organizations. To see Kerr fight in another  tournament was a little bit of an insult. He was just as dominating as a  Vitor Belfort, yet he had to go thru a tournament again. Still Kerr was  ready and able. Serious competition from undefeated BJJ sensation Carlos  Barreto, and UFC vet Dave Beneteau fell before him.
The first Superfight  pitted Randy Couture vs. Vitor Belfort. Randy Couture was a UFC heavyweight  tourney champ in search of an upset, against the incredible Vitor Belfort.  Belfort was already touted as the next eventual Superfight champion. His  dominating victories and his great personality had the makings of great  things to come. The match-up against Couture was just another hurdle in his  quest. Leading up to the fight, Couture seemed loose and fresh, while  Belfort looked tight(too buffed) and serious. The fight became the greatest  upset and still is to this day the greatest upset ever in MMA history. This  fight alone is worth checking this video out!
The Main event(Superfight  2) was for the UFC title. Maurice Smith was back to defend his championship  against Tank Abbott. On paper a clear mismatch, but Abbott's right hand  always makes a fight interesting. Abbott is the clown of the UFC, a  sideshow in a sport trying to legitimize itself. He is basically a tool to  bring in the beer-guzzling idiots who help fill the seats. His role is  known, but his decision to fight in such short notice should be commended.  He was beat, and did submit verbally, but he earned a little bit more  respect.",965520000,4,1860,4.850318471337579
7798404,4,1573624128,"I'm always glad to see new UFC's get released and this one isn't as good as UFC 6 or 13 but however it gives one something to think about.
The ""Collision Course"" offered a superfight between the storied Vitor  Belfort, a jiu jitsu wrecking crew whose UFC fights had yet to exceed two  minutes, and Randy Couture, an underdog wrestling expert. Admittedly, I was  psyched to see Belfort fight again; however, Couture displayed the tenacity  that won him the title of UFC XIV champion, as he surprised fight fans  everywhere with his punching ability.  In the marquee matchup of the night,  UFC Heavyweight Champion Maurice Smith defended his title against last  minute substitution Tank Abbott. Dan Severn was the scheduled competitor,  but due to injury Tank was given a shot at glory in the octagon.  Since I'm  a huge fan of Tank Abbott since his brutality in UFC 6 I was really happy  about this last minute substitution. Sumarization: there's alot of goodies  in this one but it's not as great as the others in the series, a big plus  thou for the fact that Vitor Belfort returns in this installment of UFC to  fight again.",960940800,2,1126,4.673469387755102
