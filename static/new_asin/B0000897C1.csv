7980397,5,B0000897C1,Obstacles is a great movie that I seen yrs ago. I'm only purchasing it again because I owned it on tape and that's how old the movie is. As far as the movie concerned I loved it and I want to keep it in my old collection of movies. It is worth watching.,1418515200,,253,3.792452830188679

7980399,5,B0000897C1,"this movie was excellent from start to finish. the movie actually had a moral behind it which some movies don't have, they think because they put rappers in it, it will make people want to see it and then they are disappointed that they wasted their money because the acting isn't any good. this is NOT one of those movies.",1257292800,2,323,4.4

7980401,3,B0000897C1,"A YOUNG TEEN [D-SHOT] WHO SEEMS HEADED FOR COLLEGE, ALL OF A SUDDEN NEEDS MONEY TO KEEP HIM AND HIS FAMILY FROM GETTING THROWN OUT OF THEIR HOUSE. UNFORTUNATELY, HE GETS THE MONEY FROM AN OLD ENEMY [E-40] WHO HAPPENS TO BE A DRUG DEALER. SOON, HE BEGINS TO GET SUCKED IN TO THE HUSTLING LIFESTYLE. WELL, THIS IS QUITE OK FOR A MOVIE THAT RELIES ON A LOTTA RAPPERS FOR A CAST. THIS AIN'T TOO BAD, IT IS WATCHABLE. ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS FILM IS THAT IT RIPPED OFF THE OPENING CREDITS OF ''BOYZ N THE HOOD''. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A SUPRISINGLY WATCHABLE FILM.",1066521600,3,569,4.229357798165138
