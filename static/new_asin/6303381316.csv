7845784,5,6303381316,"I ordered Tamilee Webb's QUICK TONING BUNS OF STEEL after reading the July 5, 2000, review, which said, ""It seems as though the video was trying to focus on (Tamilee Webb's) body as opposed to the routine. On a number of occasions, we are shown Tamilee's bare buttocks in her thong fitness outfit ... It is obvious that she wanted to expose her rear end during the video to sell more copies! Is it really necessary to walk around without any clothes on to sell your video?""
But(t), before admiring men order QUICK TONING BUNS OF STEEL, take it from me, those words were false advertising.  I purchased the tape and, as I eagerly viewed it, what I'm sure would have been wonderful images of Tamilee Webb's behind never appeared.  Disappointed, I sold my copy of QUICK TONING BUNS OF STEEL.  (As the 7/5/00 reviewer was anonymous, I wonder if Tamilee Webb herself wrote it to get men to buy her video.  Pretty sneaky, Tamilee.)
I can't honestly rate QUICK TONING BUNS OF STEEL as I didn't buy it for the glute exercises.  But I rate the video five stars out of lasting (or lusting) admiration for the way Tamilee Webb  appeared in two other videos, ABS OF STEEL and ADVANCED WORKOUT ABS OF STEEL.  In those two, there are lots of nice shots of Tamilee's incredible body.  In the first ABS OF STEEL, you even see a couple of halfway decent rear end shots.  And in the second one, she barely wears an eye-popping sports bra.  Plus, since both abs videos are from 1991, Tamilee had the prime of her youth working for her, too!
Tamilee, when are your first two ABS OF STEEL videos coming out on D.V.D.?",1038787200,5,1596,4.472413793103448
7845785,3,6303381316,"I purchased this video in hopes it would be as good as Tammilee's Abs of Steel.  The first workout is good, but the second is better if you are looking to feel the ""burn"".  I did not attempt the 3rd workout with the step. It seemed a little more aerobic than I like and I do not own or plan to buy a step.  I was hoping for more target toning than this video provided, but felt it provided a good workout for the buns. The trick she shows you in the second workout will have you ""bouncing"" in your car, at work or anytime you need to feel that little extra in your buns.",1035849600,2,570,3.9391304347826086
7845786,5,6303381316,"This is a fantastic lower body video.  It's broken down into 3 15 minute segments.  Part 1 is all standing squats, plies, and lunges.  This will burn your legs!  Part 2 is interesting floor work with some different moves  that really work your buttocks.  Part 3 uses a step.  Not only will you  work your buns you will also work your thighs too.  Great video, I  recommend it.  It is one of the better lower body videos I have done.",951696000,25,432,4.275
7845787,5,6303381316,"There are three different segments. One segment uses a step (but not required) and it really works your buns and thighs. If you stick with this tape, you will definitely notice results. My last tape got broken, so I am  buying a copy.",945216000,8,234,4.441860465116279
