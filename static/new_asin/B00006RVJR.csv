1795628,5,B00006RVJR,"This had to have been one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Ice Cube did a wonderful job in portraying Calvin.  Cedric The Entertainer - what can I say - funny as always!  I think it had such a positive message as well as an excellent cast.  Not a lot of cursing, so you can feel free to take the children. People of all races can feel comfortable about this  movie that in my opinion will be just as good to view 5 years from now!",1032393600,,438,3.8876404494382024
1795629,5,B00006RVJR,"Ice Cube has really come into his own. It was just over 10 years ago when he first appeared on the big screen in the gritty urban drama, ""Boyz In The Hood,"" as the greasy jheri-curl wearing Doughboy, and now he has reappeared in another urban masterpiece worthy of the aforementioned praise as ""Boyz"" received years earlier. Calvin (Ice Cube) has inherited his late father's local barbershop, a staple in the South Side of Chicago community for over 40 years.  Calvin reluctantly runs the shop, because he has bigger dreams of running a recording studio.  When he falls behind in his payments, he sells the shop to a local loan shark (played by Keith David, also of ""Dead Presidents"" and ""Eye for an Eye"" fame). He soon realizes what a BIG mistake this was. Not only does he realize the jewel he has is gone, but the fact that the loan shark wants to change the business into a strip club!! Calvin tries to return the money to the loan shark, only to be told that the shop can become his if he can repay $40,000 by 7pm that night. In other news, one of his barbers, who is also a two-time felon, is being harassed by the local cop for possibly stealing an ATM machine from the mini-mart next door. The hilarious capers that ensue are played out by none other than Anthony Anderson (of ""Two Can Play That Game"", ""Kingdom Come"" and ""Romeo Must Die"" fame) and Lahmard Tate of (Don't Be A Menace..."") fame. The predicaments these two nuts find themselves in is downright funny! Cedric the Entertainer sprinkles his comedic edge all through this movie that will have you crying in tears! Look out for rapper Eve in her movie debut (and she's not that bad either.) Barbershop is a family-oriented flick, that is non-violent and doesn't use a lot of cussing, either. You will enjoy every minute of it.",1032220800,10,1794,4.533950617283951
1795630,5,B00006RVJR,"As the owner of a neighberhood barber shop, Ice Cube has some important decisions to face.  His father was the original owner of the store, and now Cube is faced with the decision to sell or not.
Of course, you have to throw in the snide commentary by none other than Cedric the Entertainer and a verbal melee from other characters.  All in all, a wonderful film.",1032134400,2,363,4.402985074626866
1795631,5,B00006RVJR,"Lots of fun.  I laughed so hard that I cried.... several times.  The only character missing was the Black Muslim selling bean pies.  I'll get this DVD as soon as it comes out; but, while I'm waiting, I'm going out to get the music CD, the score was also excellent.",1031961600,,264,4.24
1795632,5,B00006RVJR,"It is so refreshing to see a movie without blood and guts and shooting but with an urban theme. The story revolves around a makeshift family of barbers headed by a young man who has to live up to his father's legacy but yet has dreams of his own. The movie has everything...there's a hero, a villain, and two hapless smash-and-grabbers are the comic relief. There are tender moments, also. I found the scene where the old barber gives a lesson to the younger ones very moving. Ice Cube has really come into his own, and I'm happy to see him play a less violent character than usual. It's a step up for him. Cedric is phenomenal, and outdoes Eddie Murphy when it comes to playing an older character. Best of all, the hero comes out on top! I left the theater feeling really good.
When a person sees a film that's based on unfamiliar characters, culturally speaking, the potential arises for getting hung up on certain things. People somewhat familiar with urban culture, like myself, know that we grow up hearing a lot of foul language. But if I can watch a movie like My Big Fat Wedding and not get hung up on kids being spit on for luck and enjoy the story anyway, I think that all but the most puritan of white people can enjoy Barbershop if they can relate to a guy who just wants to do the right thing for his family...including his extended family in the shop. This is another great ethnic feel-good movie, it won't get nominated for anything, and I don't care! When this is out on video, it'll be a welcome addition to my collection.",1031875200,18,1539,4.4035087719298245

1795635,4,B00006RVJR,"Funny and warm. This is a nice movie. Definitely has race as a central part of the movie - actually what's called ""reverse racism"" of blacks looking down at someone who is white. But it's done in a constructive way.

There isn't an incredible amount of running around kind of action but it's funny, happy, connective, and keeps you on your toes. I liked watching it.",1491264000,,366,4.545454545454546

It does not rely on heavy stereotyping of its characters and their culture but does not turn its head away from some of the real issues facing these people.  It's a refreshing plot that does not lean too much on ""blackness"".

1795775,3,B00006RVJR,"Another pretty good Ice Cube movie. he seems to turn them out like Tyler Perry, with no particular pattern in mind, just get some people together and make some money. My fans will come to see it. I was heartfelt because my father was a barber, and had his own shop about 2 blocks from our home. I have 2 brothers and a slew of cousins who also followed into the trade. The movie was like an enjoyable ensemble that played off the small screen atmosphere and didn't wander away from the central theme, which made each scene rather predictable, but the acting was fair and the true star of the show was the ever funny Cedric. It will come as no surprise that he held the movie together even as it began to unravel before the 3rd act, and his comedic presence saved the day.",1479168000,,771,4.287671232876712

1795847,4,B00006RVJR,"While often cast in action films, lead actor Ice Cube is most in his element in the 2002 comedy BARBERSHOP. Ice Cube's rap music, which made him famous years before he ever acted in a movie, champions community.  If there is a theme to his art, it is watching out for and helping one another, as opposed to getting rich and forgetting about friends and neighbors. While the characters in BARBERSHOP have their ups and downs in this story of a hair cutter's decision about selling his shop, the movie makes it clear that they need one another and are at their best when they stand together. As I don't want to blow the story for those who have yet to see this fine little gem of a film, that sentiment motivates the barbershop owner Ice Cube plays to make his final sell-or-stay decision.",1410480000,,787,4.465277777777778

I was expecting a good comedy which would reveal the little-known aspects of black culture that nobody ever talks about.  Instead, I got a rushed and confusing movie where I couldn't make head or tail of, and bailed after 20 minutes.

What did I see?  Two men use a truck to smash into a shop and steal its safe, then a man trying to make himself rich by making a hit record after having made previous failed attempts (a la The Honeymooners), a barbershop opening and a customer trying to cadge a free haircut, then a man cheating on his girlfriend, then the fuss over the robbery, then...it got so confusing I couldn't determine who was who and what was going on, and failed to find any laughs.

It could have been a contender with the concept presented.  But it ended up being just a badly-made comedy full of loose ends and cacophony.",1397347200,,915,4.384615384615385

From beginning to end, Barbershop piles on the jokes. Just step into this uproariously funny (and scathingly brilliant) comedy peppered with what some may consider to be politically incorrect humor. It's fresh to hear black people talking like this when most of them these days are usually leftist-leaning.

My only complaint is the combining of God's Name with a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity. Why doe film-makers feel they have to put that in a movie? that's the only thing I didn't like about the film.

1795863,4,B00006RVJR,"I enjoyed the movie, the story was true to life about what takes place in a neighborhood barbershop. The acting was great, even the extras were good and added to the enjoyment of the movie.",1334880000,,189,4.428571428571429
1795864,3,B00006RVJR,"Ice Cube's latest flick Barbershop acts as a commentary on the value of history in a community and that it takes people who care to make a community work.  To do this, the movie spends a day in the life of the small barber shop, set in Chicago.  The central conflict is Ice Cube, despite his better judgement, sells the shop to a loan shark because he has tried several get-rich-quick schemes which, unsurprisingly, has failed to pay off.

At the beginning of the movie we see Ice Cube trying to work on his recording studio, which is a long way from being operational.  Ice Cube gets so caught up in this current project, of which there have been many precedents, that when the offer comes to sell the shop he jumps at it.  The loanshark then tells him that, while they will keep the sign outside saying ""Barbershop,"" he intends to make it a strip club.  Ice Cube promptly realises his mistake and tries to give him the money back but he won't take it.

That's the central plot of Barbershop, but in this case the plot is not the real meat of the movie.  Instead, Barbershop's main agenda is showing you how these characters who are in the barbershop react to one another and what negative impacts they will endure if the loanshark is indeed successful in turning it into a strip club.

In this cast of characters, there are the old timers, a college kid who isn't as smart as he thinks, a white barber who is acts black, a woman whose tired of being cheated on and very protective of her apple juice, a felon convicted two times his trying to get his life together, and a West African who speaks with an accent.  Through the course of the movie, we see all these characters interact and watch as they learn together and rub each other raw in some cases.  The college kid and the white barber have a big conflict because the college kid accuses the white barber of just trying to act black when he's not.  Through it all, we see what a communal experience the barbershop is for them all and what an impact it has on the community.

Another major subplot is the two bungling burglers who steal an ATM machine.  This subplot often had the best sequences in the movie, especially when one of the burglars has is carting the ATM down the street and the covering comes off.  He has to place it up against the wall and act like it's a working ATM.  There are several more mishaps in this subplot.

In the end, Barbershop, after giving us a chance to go through these characters' day, speaks of the very high importance of community gathering spots, and how to be a good citisen you need to help out others and not to neglect the community.  Barbershop shows you that you don't need an elaborate plot to tell a good story.  This movie, much like the store, is more about the people than anything else.

1795869,4,B00006RVJR,"A day in the life of a barbershop on the south side of Chicago. Calvin, who inherited the struggling business from his deceased father, views the shop as nothing but a burden and waste of his time. After selling the shop to a local loan shark, Calvin slowly begins to see his father's vision and legacy and struggles with the notion that he just sold it out. The barbershop is filled with characters who share their stories, jokes, trials and tribulations. In the shop we find Eddie, an old barber with strong opinions and no customers. Jimmy is a highly educated barber with a superiority complex who can't stand Isaac, the new, white barber who just wants a shot at cutting some hair. Ricky is an ex-con with two strikes against him and is desperately trying to stay straight. Terri is a hard-edged woman who can't seem to leave her two-timing boyfriend. And lastly there's Dinka, a fellow barber who is madly in love with Terri but doesn't get the time of day. The movie is funny and has a satisfying ending.",1263859200,3,1011,4.56043956043956
1795870,3,B00006RVJR,"Calvin (Ice Cube) inherited his fathers Barbershop a few years ago, and while he likes it, it just isn't what he wants to be. He'd rather be doing something that will make him rich, such as recording music, because he wants to provide for his wife and kid. Sadly his father left him more than just the barbershop; he left him some serious debt with the barbershop. The bank wants to take the shop from him thanks to the debt, but Calvin decides to sell it to a local shady business man named Lester Wallace for a measly 40 grand so he can at least keep it a Barbershop. Lester lies to him though, and is going to turn it into a strip club. After Calvin changes his mind, Lester won't give the shop back for less than 80 grand. And Calvin just has a couple days to figure out how to get the rest of the money so he can keep his shop.

Barbershop is a nice little comedy dealing with the `black' barbershops. How they are like the local hangout or the office water cooler. It's where the men usually do their gossiping, or telling jokes, or just catching up with one another. The cast is diverse, but very 1, 2, 3. You have the angry upset black man trying to make something of himself, the one black man that tries to tell others they need to educate themselves, the old black man who doesn't care about things and tells lots of jokes, the angry black woman who sticks with her cheating man, the white dude trying to be black and everyone laughs at but he's the best haircutter there, the black guy who's hard on the outside and always going to jail... but a sweetheart inside, the actual African guy, and the usual peanut gang of customers. Actually as I type that out, it kind of sounds racist... but hey... I didn't write the characters.  Cedric the Entertainer plays the old man, and even though he's not my favorite character, he did have some funny parts. I love how he rocks on people like Jesse Jackson and tells his thoughts on things. Stuff that if a white man said it, they'd be killed probably. Eve plays the woman role, and I really liked her character. She constantly made me laugh; especially when she came out holding her apple juice screaming at people cause someone drank it. And Eve is pretty hot.

All in all, the movie is just a nice little watch. Nothing great... but not bad either. Definitely give it a rent.

P.S. - I used to be best friends with a black kid named Chivas way back in the day when we were like 9 or 10. I remember one day he came over to my house to trade baseball cards and he had got his hair cut. It was that kind of box top thing but he had the most amazing thing I ever saw at that time done to his hair. He had Michael Jordan cut into his hair, doing his famous jump, over a Nike symbol. I was so mad my parents would let me do that with my hair. I wanted a ninja turtle done to mine. Or He-Man. Something like that.",1242518400,,2862,4.188747731397459

1795872,5,B00006RVJR,"There are kids out there who only know Ice Cube from movies. If he's not there yet, I do believe Cube is getting precariously close to becoming better known as an actor than a rapper. As someone who's jammed to his hip hop flavor since his NWA days, I can't help but feel that this is a bit of a damn shame. On the other hand, I do enjoy his film stuff. Cube's been one of the few folks who've successfully transitioned from music to movies. BARBERSHOP is one of his best films, and just may be my favorite Ice Cube flick.

BARBERSHOP is an ensemble comedy that covers a day in the life of Calvin's Barbershop. Calvin's Barbershop has been a fixture in Chicago's seamy South Side for three generations now. It's the hangout of choice for the impoverished neighborhood, a place to chill, where verbal gamesmanship is engaged, controversial opinions are voiced (""This ain't nothing but healthy conversation.""), and the earthy dialogue range from Civil Rights issues to whether a scallop is a shellfish. It serves as the pulse of the community. In fact, when a hood wanted to learn the word on the street, he sends his henchman to the barbershop. Ice Cube plays Calvin Palmer, the barbershop's beleaguered proprietor, who early in the film makes the mistake of selling his establishment to a loan shark. Calvin spends much of the film trying to get it back.

There's a silly subplot involving two inept dudes who steal an ATM machine. But, really, although laced with its own funny moments, that storyline serves primarily as breathing room away from the barbershop scenes. Less claustrophobic, this way. According to the audio commentary, Anthony Anderson was the first actor signed, and it was felt that his scenes ought to be expanded more.

I really enjoy this movie. BARBERSHOP is funny and sweet and rowdy (in a PG-13 kind of way). And it glows with easy warmth. Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer are the big names, and, make no mistake, they earn their paychecks. Cube mainly plays the straight man here, and he nicely rides herd over his boisterous bunch. Certainly, his solid presence grounds the film. Which is good, because a lot of the other characters are pretty colorful. And Cedric the Entertainer's Eddie just may be the most offbeat of 'em all. Eddie's an old, grizzled barber (with unconvincing makeup) who dispenses funny lines and occasional nuggets of wisdom, certainly much more so than he doles out shaves and haircuts. The supporting cast knocks it out the park, with three particular standouts: Sean Patrick Thomas as the snobbish college graduate, lovely hip hop artist Eve as the tough but vulnerable Terri, and Michael Ealy as the two-time felon Ricky. On the villainous tip, Keith David is slimily memorable in his few scenes as the loan shark Lester Wallace.

Honestly, this is some of the funniest riffs I'd ever heard. And the good-natured feel of the film makes it that much easier to like. I don't know why it's so, but my favorite moment in the film (and I have many favorite moments here) happens to be when Jimmy and Isaac were about to go at it, and then, out of the blue, Marvin Gaye's ""Got To Give It Up (Part One)"" plays out of the radio and eases all tensions. It was, I dunno, cathartic. Check it out, and see what you think.

And, lastly (since I guess I'm still on that thinking tip regarding dude's hip hop career), if I had to compare BARBERSHOP, my favorite Ice Cube flick, to an Ice Cube track, that track would have to be the laid back, feel good ""It Was A Good Day."" Which, coincidentally, is my favorite Ice Cube track.",1210204800,,3570,4.6513470681458005

Instead of evolving in music, culture and film he turned his focus onto sophomoric humor and bombastic slapstick with ""we are the world"" dialogue that adds up to nothing but a neo-version of ""Birth of a Nation."" All the cardboard characters in Barber Shop get crafted into stereotypes that do not add up to much but minimal spurts of bathroom humor. Ice Cube weaves in and out of serious topics about ownership, real-estate, white collar crime and Anglo fantasies but these addressed get re-dressed and celebrated for their errors and mistakes. In my conclusion, there is no redemption to the immoral of the story. Nothing here is worth the price for this dvd.

Ice Cube plays Calvin Palmer, owner of a Chicago barbershop, a shop that once belonged to his father. It's not exactly in the best neighbourhood, but it's a living (someone stole an ATM from over the road, for instance, but that's another story). He's got a loving wife, a baby on the way, a home studio on the side, but he's also got a lot of debt and a lot of bills to pay.

His barbershop is full of history, it's an important place for the community, and if the loan shark has his way there'll never be a place like this in the area again. Can Calvin get his shop back?

1795880,5,B00006RVJR,"From the Sisyphean (say what?) misadventures of a kind of black Laurel and Hardy duo (Anthony Anderson and Lahmard J. Tate) who steal an ATM machine with no money in it that they can't open, to the white dude who thinks he's black, to Cedric the Entertainer who thinks that Rosa Parks got too much credit for parking her butt on the bus, to sexy and saucy Eve who always loves the wrong guy, this is one fine piece of entertainment.  And Ice Cube as Calvin who owns the shop ain't so bad himself, although he sure has to frown a lot.

Well, he's got troubles right here in the Windy City.  He's always got an entrepreneurial scheme up his sleeve that just doesn't quite work out which causes him to fall behind in his property taxes.  Now this might not be such a big deal but the barbershop has been in his family for three generations and it serves as a kind of neighborhood club where people can hang out and shoot the breeze.  It's a beloved kind of place.  Enter Lester Wallace the loan shark with muscle who makes Calvin an offer he can't refuse.  Well, he does refuse it or at least he tries, but Wallace ain't the kind of dude to take a refusal.

Can Calvin save the barbershop?  That's the question of the main plot line, but what really makes this movie such a treat are the barbershop mini-stories that are neatly tied together and the fine repartee.  And what makes THAT work is that everything in the film is seen from a point of view inside the black community and not from somebody else looking in (which never works, but is often tried).

Add a warm and redemptive ending, and there ain't nobody cryin'.

1795881,5,B00006RVJR,"Barbershop is a rare event in African-American filmmaking. It's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for African-Americans. I love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the African-American community is; we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen. I really liked this movie. We definitely need more films like this

Calvin is the owner of a Chicago Barbershop passed on to him by his late father. Mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes, Calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life. It's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood. There are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they're all easy to follow. One follows a stolen ATM machine, one follows the quest for love of an African immigrant, another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend, another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview, and yet another follows a white barber's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with. In a way, this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like Pulp Fiction that follow many characters and their stories. Each of the stories lead up to the ending where Calvin saves the barbershop.

Director Tim Story does a great job of capturing life in Chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop. I felt the spirit of the Windy City and the informal environment of the barbershop. Watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in Harlem my father used to take me to when I was a boy. It also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop I used to go to get my flat-top trimmed (Both are closed now.) :(

There are a ton of great performances in this movie; I'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people. Ice Cube is great as Calvin. I liked his performance here. Michael Ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber. Ealy makes you feel his characters' desperation. Cedric the Entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber. He's funny and poignant. Sean Nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college. Anthony Anderson and Larenz Tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an ATM with no money in it. Watching them try to open will make you laugh. Keith David is creepy as the loan shark. Then again, Keith David is always good in anything he does. I'd pay money to watch him and Sam Jackson read listings in the yellow pages.

I don't know why Movie Critics and the Rev. Jesse Jackson denounced Barbershop, it's one of the best movies ever made about African-American life. Looking at the box office of Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black Woman, African-Americans actually WANT more films like this. As a black moviegoer I want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community, not just one small part of it. I for one and tired of the ""Hood"" movies like Never Die Alone, and Critically acclaimed movies like Monster's Ball and Hustle & Flow that depict black life as something negative. (Thankfully, it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too, the box office and DVD sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black woman are going up.)

What especially impressed me was the ensemble of actors.  Ice Cube showed depth to his acting that I had not before appreciated.  I also found myself paying attention to all of Cedric the Entertainer's time on screen, all of his nuances and lines were equally entertaining.

This movie has enough positive reviews, but I only want to mention the controversy that arose when the movie premiered.  That had to do with the scene in which Cedric's character mocks Rosa Parks, the civil rights figure.  Some in the civil rights community took great offense that Ms. Parks would be ridiculed.  If this is all that happened in the movie, then their anger would be justified.  However, one needed to see the context of the comments, which was to highlight the sanctity of the barbershop for those who worked and patronized the shop.  Cedric's character made a point of saying that anything can be said in the shop and that was the history of freedom enjoyed by all frequented the establishment.  Also, the negative comments were vociforously countered by all the others in the shop, so Ms. Parks was not left with mud.  I heard that some were so angry that they demanded that Cedric apologize.  That would be like asking the actor who played Judas in the Greatest Story Ever Told to apologize for turning in Christ.  He was an actor playing someone who would say these things.  He did not say that he endorsed it.

We are the only race of people who call learning ""trying to be white"" or ""trying to be better than people"".Young Blacks found nothing wrong with this movie because Black parents, for whatever reason, do not teach matters of race in the home.

There are a lot of funny moments in this, mostly provided by Cedric the Entertainer, who is completely believable as an old guy, full of opinions, and ready to pontificate on any of them at the drop of a hat.

Truly, the best part of this movie is the characters.  Ice Cube is very sweet as Calvin -- father-figure to the younger barbers, but still learning to grow into his father's shoes.  Sean Patrick Thomas is wonderful as Jimmy the college-boy who may be a little too big for his britches, but is kept on his toes by the rest of the gang.  Anthony Anderson shows a wide range in playing the enigmatic Ricky -- smart enough to put Jimmy in his place, suave and sincere enough to give Dinka a pure answer about picking up women, raw enough to standoff the cops, trusting enough to learn from Calvin.  And then there's Eve.... she really acts the part of Terri very well, but she seems to be too good-looking for the part, almost like they should have used makeup and padded clothes to ugly and fatten her up for it.

Ice Cube delivers on all the promise he's ever shown as an actor playing the over-acheiving, dreamer with a heart Calvin Palmer. He show's his carachter's flaws as well as his strong points which is something that is often times lost in the world of today's movies.

The other actors show that they too have range from Cedric the Entertainer who I've loved since he was hosting Comicview to Michael Ealy whom I first saw in this movie and fell in love with. Even newcomer Eve shows she can deliver when handed the role of a strong capable woman.

The themes of the main plot of the movie are universal, acceptance in who you are and what you are. Learning to accept someone not by the color  of their skin, but by the content of their charachter (Okay so I stole that line from Dr. Martin Luthor King Jr.) Loving someone, but having the courage to not let them walk all over you. And the deep rich tradition steeped in African American BarberShops all over the world.

Okay so the Subplot was rather pointless and even though it did have something to do with the end of the movie, by the time you got to that point you were so sick of seeing these two buffoons make bumbing idiots out of themselves that you were begging someone to arrest them.

But all in all this is something I think we've lost sight of sometimes, a good family film. A film I can honestly say I would sit down and watch with my three year old son.",1099094400,2,1555,4.326460481099656

The barbershop has been a neighborhood institution in the African American community.  It is the place that, historically, black men could gather together and talk about anything, from politics to religion to sports and not have to worry about white society.  Long after the politics of the Civil Rights movement, the barbershop remains an important cornerstone of the neighborhood.
The barbershop in question here is owned by Calvin (Ice Cube).  It has been in the family for fifty years and while Calvin dreams (and tries) grander things, he also wants the shop to succeed.  Unfortunately, the shop is not making much money (the reason for that is debated throughout the movie), and Calvin goes to a loan shark for help.  It is too late when he realizes his mistake and now the barbershop is under a serious risk of being closed for good.  Meanwhile there is a strange subplot about a couple of guys who stole an ATM and are trying to get the money from it.  Everything ties together in the end, in a surprising way.
This seems to be a fairly simplistic description, but the heart of the movie is actually in the barbershop and the dynamic of the relationships that we see there.  I expected this to be another ""dumb comedy"", but this is actually fairly classy and intelligent and worth seeing.  This should not be dismissed as a genre film, but is honestly a good movie.

1795893,5,B00006RVJR,"This perfectly charming, yet complex, film should be read as a multi-layered response to Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing,"" which it name checks throughout.  To be sure, Lee made that ground-breaking film in a totally different climate, and without Lee's trail-blazing example, ""Barbershop"" would never have been made. Granted.  All the same, the movie rewrites Lee's film in such a way that it both pays homage and levels a critique, all at the same time.  For one thing, the screenplay is classically constructed according to the standards of Hollywood film; at the same time, this concession does not difuse the movie's subversive appeal: witness the firestorm of controversy surrounding Sedrick the Entertainer's riff about Rosa Park and O.J. Simpson.  That acheivement marks this movie as a classic piece of signifying irony.  The fact that it was hit--and deserved to be one--means that its message got out there. And the message was that community matters, and that the struggle of African Americans has changed in its texture--witness the great turn by the Italian Chicago white boy who wants to be black--but not in its paraticulars.  The Barbarshop is a place where everyone, including an old-school rabble rouser like Sedrick the Entertainer's character--can say what he believes, and that's what matters.  The film is, itself, that symbolic Barbershop. The best narrative innovation is the hapless morons who steal that ATM machine, which becomes in the film an updated version of the racist piggy bank in Ellison's ""Invisible Man.""  An ingenious, well made movie that deserves to be a popular classic.  I can't wait to rent the sequel.",1078704000,3,1647,5.161654135338346
1795894,5,B00006RVJR,"Calvin Palmer has a pregnant wife, some big dreams, and a barbershop he inherited from his father and his grandfather before him that he doesn't particularly want.  Seems Calvin yearns for bigger and better things, like having his own recording studio.  But when he contracts with a local loan shark to sell the barbershop to finance his pie-in-the-sky schemes, Calvin is brought up short by the realization of how much the barbershop means to his employees, his customers and his community.  Because the local barbershop in a black neighborhood is an institution, a place where the guys can come in, kick back, trade news and views and feel at home.  Calvin realizes he's made a terrible mistake.  But how to rectify it?  The loan shark plans to turn the barbershop into a strip joint and he wants double the selling price to sell it back.  There's a lot of moving and shaking and a hysterically funny subplot involving a stolen ATM before this film reaches its conclusion.

The cast is excellent all around.  Ice Cube is wonderful as Calvin, who doesn't know what a treasure his family has owned for three generations until he's about to lose it.  I thought Eve was very effective as Terri Jones, the lady barber who has had it up to here with her no-good two-timing boyfriend.  Anthony Anderson is hilarious as JD, probably the dumbest would-be robber who ever hijacked an empty ATM.  But the big draw in this film is Cedric the Entertainer as Eddie, with a leonine head of hair that looks like he stuck a wet finger in an electric socket, pontificating and philosophizing, offering up insights and chunks of wisdom that are sharp as a razor and devastatingly funny.  The movie feels totally real; we're right there inside the barbershop, kicking back along with the cast and enjoying every second.  It's a film with a lot of warmth and a lot of heart, and not a dull moment in it.  We leave this movie feeling it's life's intangibles that really count.

This film is speaks to all kinds of people, especially to African Americans, I think. Many people will disagree with me because the film pokes fun at famous cultural black icons, including Rosa Parks and Jesse Jackson. People who are offended must realize that the film is honest.

The suspense drama concerned the modern day conflict
between the intangible goals of meaning, honesty, and

Ice Cube played a barber shop owner who didn't want his employees cursing, Cedric the Entertainer played an amusing and quite insightful old man, and several of the other characters were quite good as well.

1795905,5,B00006RVJR,"Ice Cube plays a man unhappy with his life. He manages a barbershop on Chicago's Southside, an establishment he inherited - along with its workers and patrons - from his father, deceased just a few years past. He chases get-rich-quick schemes (thinking other professions are more noble) and ends up selling the barbershop to the devil (the local loan shark) in order to pay off his debts. Only then does he realize the contribution that both he - and his barbershop - make to his community.
Cedric the Entertainer, as the resident Socrates, says it best; the barbershop is ""the black man's country club."" It's a place where souls can gather and great philosophy can be discussed, such as how a ""Woman with a Big Ass"" is different from a ""Big Ass Woman!"" Everyone speaks in cadence. And there's a stylish handshake for every occasion.
A cute black babe, Eve, also works there. But it's the men who steal the show. A white guy tries to act black (and eventually proves himself to be sincere towards the movie's end). Sean Patrick Thomas (Save the Last Dance) plays an obnoxious know-it-all, and everyone's foil. Two other fools steal an ATM machine, and spend the entire film comically trying to break it open. Imagine the two bumbling housebreakers in Home Alone with nappier heads, and you'll get the picture.
The movie reminded me of a black man's version of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life -- except with much better music. Unlike Jimmy Stewart, Ice Cube doesn't get to see the world without him, and neither does he try to commit suicide. But he does come to realize that, in his neighborhood, his barbershop plays an integral role; and that he, as its proprietor - is actually a pillar of the community. Without him, the lives of others would definitely be much worse.
For his wife, Jimmy had the lovely Donna Reed; and Ice Cube, just as lucky, has the gorgeous Jazsmin Lewis as his always supportive better-half.
This was easily Ice Cube's most touching role. And the movie break dances nicely between hilarity - and poignancy.",1051920000,2,2036,4.738028169014084

It's set in a barbershop in an African American neighborhood in the south side of Chicago and stars Ice Cube.  There's lots of philosophy and great dialog - most of which is not politically correct.
Actually the acting isn't particularly good.  And neither is the over-simplified story. But I howled with laughter every time a segment about two crooks who steal an ATM machine came on the screen.  And, at some points, the dialog was so good that I found myself applauding out loud.
I usually don't like comedies.  And so, coming from me, this film has got to get a super-duper high rating.  Even now, as I'm writing about it I feel like bursting into laughter.  No kidding, that's saying a lot.",1050710400,4,802,4.652482269503546

I'm one of the few people I know who absolutely hated Friday and figured since Ice Cube was in this movie it was probably more of the same. The Rosa Parks/Martin Luther King controversy surrounding the film didn't help either. But since my friends kept encouraging me to see it, I rented it.
Well it turns out that I really liked this movie. It's sweet and for the most part very true to real life. Every actor is dead on perfect and the conversations/debates among the characters including the Rosa Parks and reparations arguments are not unusual in the African American community. Critics of that particular segment of the movie need to remember that Black people are not monolithic in their opinions and experiences.
The entire cast was perfect. I admit I've had my reservations about Ice Cube since his days with NWA but he was a charming leading man in this role. Cedric the Entertainer as Eddie reminds me of some folks I've known. Eve brought a sweetness to and was surprisingly effective in her part. But can Anthony Anderson please do another role besides the loud, fat guy? Thanks in advance.

1795909,4,B00006RVJR,"Renting this movie last weekend was the first time I had actually seen it, and I can't believe Jesse Jackson and his followers actually took offense to the lines referring to Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights movement in it. Of all people you would expect to get the point, and have the poetry of the script revealed to!
The point of the entire movie can be summed up in a monologue by Cedric the Entertainer (who is about as good as it gets in this role and in this movie), where he says the barbershop--which the owner (Ice Cube's character), while caught in a moral dilemma, is preparing to sell--is more than just a place where brothers can get their hair cut. Each and every barbershop in every city and inner city in America, from Harlem to Oakland (and around the world too; I've been to several African-owned shops in Germany, Holland and Italy), is like Sam's bar on CHEERS: they are ""the Black man's country club"". And in that country club, a brother can get a line, a skin-fade, a shape-up, a little trim of the beard or goatee...and rediscover the royalty of his inner being while in conversation with friends and strangers about virtually anything. As a matter of fact, the beauty of the so-called controversial lines in the movie about Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King (not to mention those about Rodney King and O.J. Simpson) triumphantly proclaim one of the best things about the Barbershop: where else can Black men hold such strong, divergent or even culturally iconoclastic opinions and have them be respected--or even heard?
The movie is a little short on character development. The sub-plot starts getting too ridiculous after the first fifteen minutes. And as good as Ice Cube is he is still growing as an actor, making me wish he were making this movie five years from now as opposed to almost a year ago. Just the same, the wealth of characters and acting in the movie give all the real local Barbershops across the world a three-dimensional tableau of a tribute via the fine acting talents of all involved and some truly wonderful (and wonderfully ridiculous) moments in the script. Actors in this movie (like the fine character actor as loneshark Keith David, whose voiceover voice is becoming more famous than he is) are seriously funny, while comedians like Cedric the Entertainer are sometimes borderline spellbinding in how serious they demand you take them as actors.
Anyone who isn't a Black man (and that includes the sisters) should see this movie and laugh unapologetically. Anyone who is, should first get a shape-up down the block, share what they think of the Iraq war and Halle Berry in spandex with the barber in the next chair... and then after you tip your boy right, buy this movie immediately.",1047859200,21,2736,4.737945492662474

1795911,5,B00006RVJR,"'Barbershop' is a superb film on several levels including its humor, drama, gustiness, and slick, understated style. The seemingly simple plot revolves around a barbershop that has been owned by three generations of the same family. The third owner, Calvin (played by Ice Cube), has grander plans for his life, but when presented with the opportunity to sell the barbershop, Calvin discovers that it is a far more important than he ever realized. Although, ramshackle and scarcely profitable, the barbershop represents a neighborhood institution. As the oldest employee tells Calvin, it is a place where a man could come to feel good about himself for an hour and where he could have some serious conversation. It was, in the employee's words, a black man's country club. Faced with the understanding that he possess much more than a run down business in the Southside of Chicago, Calvin must make a difficult decision. Much to the credit of the film, and to Ice Cube's performance, Calvin's decision is handled without sentimentality or melodrama.
This film garnered a lot of controversy because of the many negative statements one of the principle characters makes about hallowed, black civil rights leaders. It is important to recognize that while this character denigrates one famous black civil rights leader after another, this is NOT the film's definitive statement about those individuals. The purpose of the film, as the director and several cast members made clear is to show what life is like for the employees and patrons of the barbershop. How do they interact with each other? What do they talk about? What do they think is important? While, I've personally never been in a black owned barbershop in Chicago, the scene in which one of the characters lambastes the famed civil rights leaders struck me as immensely real. In any social situation, there will probably always be at least one person with a contrary opinion, who attacks even the sacred idols of society. We've never even certain if this character means it. We know that he is participating in an important daily event in the barbershop; he is having some serious conversation.
To my surprise, one of my favorite parts of the DVD was the extras section at the end, which, is well worth checking out. In this section, the filmmakers describe the extraordinary though and detail that went into every aspect of the film, from the floor plans and features of the barbershop, to the clothes each character wore. Director Tim Storey's narrative of the making of the film shows an extraordinary degree of intelligence and craftsmanship. While this film takes place in the black owned business in a predominantly black neighborhood, its themes are universally applicable to any social community in the world. And while the film examines complex racial issues in a bold and edgy manner, it never stoops to sentimentality or provocation. Definitely worth seeing, especially on DVD.",1047600000,2,2946,5.063786008230453

1795913,3,B00006RVJR,"This film got a lot of press because Jesse Jackson publicly declared that some of the dialog  should have been changed.  Probably the dialog where one of the barbers says unflattering things about Mr. Jackson.  Sounds like censorship to me, but I applaud the film for taking potentially unpopular points of view.  Like they say in the movie, if you can't say it in the barbershop, where can you say it?
This is a pleasant story about the title business trying to stay afloat in Chicago.  Ice Cube, the owner, hasn't been paying much attention to it after inheriting it from his father. But current financial needs are now making him take a closer look at it.
The barbershop is populated by a diverse group of characters, and is the best part of the film.  The highlight is Cedrick the Entertainer, who's remarks, designed to stir up controversy, are what caused all the notoriety.  It is here where the film shines, and I wish they would have spent more time writing scenes here.  It would have been a better film with more interaction here.
What we have instead is filler and ""same-old"" plot devices.  The ""same-old"" is that he's considering selling the shop, and the buyer is a local mobster who wants to turn it into a strip joint.  Thus the dilemma of cashing out and firing his employees, or keeping the struggling shop going.  We've seen this before.
There is also a loosely related plot involving the theft of a ATM machine.  This has some humorous moments, with the repeated unsuccessful attempts to open it.  These provide some amusing moments, but only are loosely related to the core of the story.  This would have been a better movie with more interaction in the shop.",1046649600,,1680,4.650847457627119

Perhaps that's because he receives some brutal lip. I think it's all jokes, but this man went as far as to suggest a boycott of this movie. Anyway, Barbershop is one heck of a good time, and it's another movie that has made me realize I have some black in me. I got nothin' but love for Barbershop.",1043884800,,723,4.443609022556391

1795923,5,B00006RVJR,"I can go on and on about how much I like Barbershop because it has no gangstas or sex like other black films do, but it's more important to like a film for what it is, not for what it isn't. And what this film is is a funny and interesting story about a day in the life of a few barbers. What I like the most about this movie is that there are different plots happening (i.e., Calvin [Ice Cube] selling the shop by accident, the two guys stealing the ATM machine), but they all intertwine together towards the end to make one story. My favorite scene is when everyone was dancing to Marvin Gaye's ""Got to Give It Up"", because that song gave the characters a time to relax. Jesse Jackson complained about barber Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer)'s derogatory comments about MLK, Rosa Parks, and other black heroes, but he's just mad because Eddie joked about him, too. By the way, I heard that the producers are gonna edit out that scene because of all the flack it's receiving, so you should get a copy before it's too late.",1043366400,2,1021,4.350785340314136

Although Calvin attempts to raise quick money, he is also running a barbershop that he has inherited from his father, which has been in his family for 40 years.  It seems like Calvin has problems raising enough money to pay the property tax and the bank is threatening to take the barbershop unless he pays.  While Calvin is struggling with the financial and social responsibilities that come with owning a shop with employees there is intriguing conversations taking place in the shop.  These conversations deal with issues such as love, isms, gossip, and much more.  The Barbershop provides comical situations as well as a hilarious performance by Cedric the Entertainer, as Eddie, who has been working at the Barbershop for ages.

1795925,4,B00006RVJR,"Barbershop is a highly comedic movie about a group of friends who work at the local barbershop owened by Calvin Palmer.  Calvin inherited the shop from his father who made it a tradition to not only help those who worked there, but to help those who just walked in the door.  Ice Cube plays Calvin Palmer, a man who has aspirations to be more than he is.  What he hasn't realized is that he is already more then he knows.  Calvin has tried every get rich scheme he can, and has finally figured out that he can do it by opening a record studio in his garage.  In order to get it off the ground, he has to have the capital, this is where the barbershop comes into play.  The local crime boss type offers Calvin $... for the shop and promises that it wil always say Barbershop on the front window.  What he doesnt tell Calvin until after he agress is that it will actually be a gentlemens club called The Barbershop, where a man can get a haircut and a little extra off the top at the same time.  However, now that Calvin has agreed to it, he can't back out.  He has to figure out some way to save the shop for his friends sake.  Each character has their own quirky charm.  Eve is stellar as the tough girl who has a man she needs to get rid of, and by the way, don't drink her apple juice.  Cedric the Entertainer plays the oldest barber to still be not cutting hair.

1795926,4,B00006RVJR,"This movie received a lot of attention, not necessarily in the box office, but in the media because of its alleged offensiveness to African Americans, especially a number of prominent black leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks.  After watching the movie, it seems to me that the ""offensive"" comments were in good taste in relation to the entire movie.
I have to admit that the controversy is what drew me to this movie, but it didn't take long for me to realize that this is a well-made comedy.  The movie stars Ice Cube as Melvin, the heir to a failing barbershop.  The entire story happens during the course of a day.  Melvin reluctantly decides to sell his barbershop for $20,000 to a loan shark (Keith David) who plans on turning it into a strip club, though he decides not to give his employees the bad news until the end of the day.  Most of the movie takes place in the barbershop, where all the barbers and their customers engage in all types of banter for the duration of the day.  The banter is what sparked the controversy in the media.  Cedric the Entertainer plays an old man named Eddie, who has been working as a barber in the shop since it opened 40 years before.  He has the most famous line in the movie when he says ""There are three things that y'all need to realize. #1- Rodney King should have got his ... beat for drunk drivin' in a white part of Los Angeles. #2- O.J. did it. and #3- Rosa Parks didn't do nuthin' but sit ... down.""  Though, not all the dialogue in the movie is this heated.  Eddie is also the one who gets Melvin to realize the importance of the barbershop.  He tells Melvin that black people in that neighborhood thought of the shop as ""their own country club.""  Melvin has a change of heart and decides he doesn't want to sell the shop, and now he has to figure out how to cancel the deal with the loan shark.
There's also a funny subplot involving two guys from the neighborhood who steal an ATM machine from a liquor store, and how they spend the day trying to figure out a way to break into the machine and take out the cash.
While I can see how this movie might be offensive to some people, I'm quite certain that MLK, Rosa Parks, and other prominent black leaders mentioned in this movie have secured their place in history, and this movie isn't going to harm their legacy.  This is a funny and entertaining movie, and definitely worth a look.",1042848000,5,2405,4.365470852017937
1795927,3,B00006RVJR,"It's kind of surprising to see Ice Cube in such a middle class, middle of the road movie. It's a long way from BOYZ N THE HOOD, but with the FRIDAY films, ANACONDA and now this, he continues to reinvent himself in role after role.
BARBERSHOP is good, clean, family-friendly fun. Oh sure, there's some spicy language and unsavory characters, but the movie presents positive values about family, neighborhood, trust and loyalty. It's a raucous comedy, but it really has its heart in the right place, which is one of the reasons you can watch it again and again.
The plot is fairly straightforward, and nothing new. Calvin Palmer, the character played by ice Cube, struggles with the choice to sell the family barbershop for the money he needs to pay off his bills and pursue his get-rich-quick schemes, or to keep it going in the memory of his father and for the good of his employees. There are plenty of twists in the plot, but in the end, of course it all works out for the best.
The main plot is paralleled by a story about two comic crooks trying to break into an ATM machine. This plot is given some weight in how it affects Ricky (Michael Ealy), an ex-con whose job in the shop gives him a chance to go straight. This plot is played mostly for laughs, but because it has some real consequences, it doesn't feel tacked on.
Cedric the Entertainer steals the show as Eddie, an old-timer whose curmudgeonly opinions are the reason Jesse Jackson called for a boycott of the movie, but who turns out to have the wisdom to help Calvin make the right choice in the end. Watch for the scene when Eddie demonstrates how to give a shave. A character who could have been simply comic relief is given real respect.
The movie isn't great, but it's funny and heartwarming, and even more effective on the small screen.",1042848000,3,1807,4.512195121951219
1795928,5,B00006RVJR,I really liked this film! I was expecting to get turned off by the Rosa Parks comment but I saw how it was used and I wasn't offended. Besides the movie was funny. It was a bloody comedy for goodness sakes and positive black comedy at that and not to be taken too politically. The dvd goodies were great as well and Eve's performance was particularly...inspiring.,1042761600,,363,4.515151515151516
1795929,4,B00006RVJR,"Although ""Barbershop"" didn't make its deserved mark on the box office, this should definitely be a rental for anyone wanting a funny, light-hearted tale about keeping things real and remembering what's important.
The story centers around Calvin, a 30-something barbershop owner whose get-rich-quick fever reminds me of Ralph Kramden of ""The Honeymooners"".  Inheriting both the barbershop and its debts from his father, Calvin desperately wants to ""buy Stedman's (Oprah's boyfriend) guest house"" by producing a platinum record and becoming wealthy to support his wife and future child.  Seeing the barbershop as a money pit, he impulsively sells it to a crooked loan shark.  Realizing how important the barbershop is to the neighborhood, his employees, and himself, he begins an earnest quest to get the barbershop back.
The ensemble that works in the barbershop is a comfortable group of cozy characters.  Cedric the Entertainer plays the senior leader in the shop, entertaining the customers and the employees with his brash opinions and uncouth comedy.  Eve plays the girl with attitude and a good heart who keeps ending up with the wrong guy.  Sean Patrick Thomas plays the intellectual of the cast, constantly chided by his peers as being a ""sell out"" who believes his education makes him better than everyone else.
I could go on forever about the engaging cast, but to sum it up, SEE THIS MOVIE!  The characters are strong, the story is great, and, although not necessarily the award-winning film of the century, it is an entertaining story of family and friendship.",1042243200,,1571,5.161417322834645
1795930,5,B00006RVJR,"Calvin's Barbershop is the ""Black man's answer to the country club.""  Located in South Chicago, it has stood for forty years as the neighborhood meeting place.  The ""chairs"" appropriate a melange of characters that keep the place jumping from all different directions.  Calvin, the shop's reluctant heir wants the shop gone--he wants to rid himself of what he sees as a money pit rather than an asset.  Eddie, the shop's veteran barber, shoots his mouth off as one would expect of the local elder statesman except his little truisms do not necessarily smack of sage advice.  Rather, they are outrageously amusing  anecdotes designed to knock the deity status out of such cultural luminaries as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Rodney King, Jesse Jackson, and, oh, yes, O.J. Simpson.  Terri, the shop's only female haircutter is a get-in-your-face diva with a philandering boyfriend.  She is loved not-so-quite-from-afar by the sweet faced West African who sweeps the floor, quotes Pablo Neruda love poetry and leaves red roses on top of her locker.  Jimmy, the college boy, thinks his educational aspirations ranks him at a higher level than Ricky, the twice convicted felon.  Both dis the shop's only white haircutter--in a bit of amusing reverse discrimination, this poor guy's whiteness insures he is never requested for cuts by the shop's more color-conscious patrons.

The plot is driven by the robbery of an ATM machine from an Indian's convenience store located across the street from the barbershop and Calvin's decision to sell the shop to a loan shark for $20,000.  As the scenes shift from the action at the shop to the hysterically funny activities of the two bumbling theives, we eventually see the connection between the two events and the larger connection that the barbershop has to the barbers, the patrons and the neighborhood.

This day-in-the-life technique would work fabulously as a one hour per week television comedy drama modelled along the lines of CBS's short-lived Italian-American venue, ""That's Life"".  ""That's Life"" was also thought to be stereotypical, but somehow despite this critical representation it managed to be funny and warm and depict real family life and values instead of politically correct blurred viewpoints that distort reality rather than promote truth.  ""Barbershop"" has that same potential---do see it, it comes highly recommended.",1042070400,3,2386,5.242105263157895
1795931,5,B00006RVJR,"Here is a movie that didn't use any hi-tech equipment to make hi-tech explosives or cause hi-tech crashes or have ""ganstavision"" as it's premise.  It just did what Hollywood lost sight of; it told a story.  Each one of the characters were real and nothing was too much, and that was what made this movie even more endearing.  Cedric the Entertainer, however, was the star that shined the brightest, because he made me remember the old men who inhabited the barbershops of my youth and, no matter how much you believed what you knew, they made sure you listened to what they had to say and you thought about it for awhile.  Of course, sometimes they were off-course with what they had to say, and sometimes you had to listen twice just to believe they had the nerve to say it, but these men held up to their convictions and didn't back down, and any topic was fair game to them.  If you agreed, fine, but if you didn't, then it was okay, and you moved on to another subject, while silently learning from them.  For me, this was one of the best movies of the year and I hope to see more that abandon glitz for the sake of story.",1041897600,2,1126,4.312796208530806

Its cast, premise, and success at the box office made me take a mental note to check out the DVD, and having finally done so, I can now understand why it was so warmly received.  While ""Barbershop"" won't exactly change the rules of filmmaking, it's a carefree and easygoing comedy that's guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.  Ice Cube is in good form as Calvin, the owner of a barbershop that's been running for three generations.  But when he gets into a financial pinch, desperate times call for desperate measures, so he gets into shady business with a loan shark who threatens the shop's future.  So will Calvin lose his shop for good?  I won't say, but I will note that ""Barbershop"" is a sure-fire crowd pleaser with good performances from Cedric the Entertainer (hilarious as an opinionated barber from the old-school), Eve as the sassy Terri (""Who drank my apple juice?!""), and Sean Patrick Thomas as the smarter-than-thou Jimmy James, who will never let you forget that he has a college education.  The plot wears a wee bit thin if predictable, but for a feel-good film this agreeable, you have to be a serious killjoy to turn your nose at ""Barbershop.""",1041724800,13,1336,4.659574468085107

1795935,5,B00006RVJR,"This movie is one of the funniest that I have seen in a long time.
Ice Cube plays a struggling young barber who inherited a barber shop from his father, but would rather be producing his own records.  The majority of the dialogue within the movie actually takes place within the barbershop and it can't be beat.  Cedric the Entertainer plays an elderly barber quick to spew out his thoughts on all things controversial, indeferent to anyone else's opinion.
Not realizing what a treasure he has, Ice Cube sells the barbershop to a loan shark, realizing too late that he really wants to keep it.
One of the side plots of the movie revolves around the theft of an ATM from a convenience store.  One of the funnier scenes in the movie is when a cop drives by as they are moving it down the street.  The quickly form a line and the cop stands in line waiting for the machine to dispense some cash.
In the end, the barbershop is saved and all is well.
A great, funny show for all to watch.",1041638400,,983,4.326086956521739
1795936,4,B00006RVJR,"When Barbershop first came out, I was a bit skeptical. I didn't know how well Ice Cube could act, and didn't know how long a movie about a barbershop could hold my interest.
I was pleasantly surprised.
In Barbershop, Ice Cube plays Calvin Palmer, a barber who took over his father's barbershop when he passed away. The shop is in a lot of debt, and with his wife expecting, Calvin has to do something to get some money. So he sells the shop to a shady loan shark, Lester Wallace (Keith David). When he realizes how much the shop means to the community, and himself, he has to get it back.
Now, it may not sound like much there, but Barbershop is truly a good movie. It seems as though the main theme of Calvin selling the shop takes a backseat to the conversation and interaction in the shop itself. This is a good thing. The supporting characters in the shop are both believable and likeable. Sean Patrick Thomas plays Jimmy James, an egocentric know-it-all with a smooth haircut. Michael Ealy is Ricky Nash, a two-time felon who is given the opportunity to clean up his act. Eve, the rapper, plays Terri, a sharp-tongued girl who's not afraid to get up in someone's face. And Cedric the Entertainer's performance as Eddie, who worked with Calvin's father, ranks among one of the most enjoyable performances of 2002. On the whole, it is the supporting cast, not Ice Cube, that makes this movie more than just average.
What detracts from Barbershop is a slow-moving side plot about two guys (Anthony Anderson and Lahmard Tate) stealing an ATM from a convenience store down the street from Calvin's. Both actors are good, but the whole thing was silly and largely unnecessary. Its relevance doesn't become clear until the end of the film.
Overall, Barbershop was surprisingly good. It elicited more than a few laughs from me, and is sure to appeal to anyone. With a great supporting cast and a dynamic, funny script, Barbershop is well worth adding to your collection.",1041465600,9,1967,4.671469740634006
1795937,5,B00006RVJR,Just watched the DVD - I missed it at the theaters.  What a great social commentary.  It captures a sense of community and all the good natured ribbing and banter that goes with it.  If you come from a place with any sense of community I guarantee you'll recognize at least a few of the characters.  Reminds me of my barbershop!,1041465600,,328,4.327868852459017
1795938,4,B00006RVJR,"""Barbershop"" from a story and screenplay by Mark Brown, was the stepchild of director Tim Story.  You can almost feel the collaboration between the unsung acting talents of Ice Cube, who is marvelous, and Story as they weave together what might have been a stereotypical story into an ensemble comedy of depth.
Barbershop moved rapidly from the screen to the stores in DVD, but the production values of its DVD extras are all there - and I especially enjoyed the outtakes!  Some slapstick comedy involving the theft of an ATM is a little tedious, but necessary for the conclusion of the story; the ability of Ice Cube's character to grasp what he really has in the Barbershop...a place of camaraderie and mixing of generations, is a revelation.

 The supporting cast is strong and works well together; of course natural funnyman Cedric the Entertainer stands out as Eddie,(and somewhat surprisingly received a lot of backlash for his characters take off on black icons like Rosa Parks and Rodney King)...Eddie's been with the shop since it opened in 1958.  He doesn't do much any more, but he's the heart and funnybone of just about every discussion that takes place.  Of the rest of the cast, young Michael Ealy stood out for me as Ricky Nash.  He gives off an intensity on the screen that more experienced actors just didn't seem to match.

You'll feel good at the end of Barbershop, you'll be amused, have had some outright laughs, and loved the closeness of the characters and their way of life.  A fine movie that begs for a sequel!",1041465600,5,1537,4.7481203007518795

Everyone who has been to a Black barbershop (or ANY local gathring place, with minor differences in culture and dialogue) can vouch for the accuracy. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, it's actually a nice story about people in a Chicago ghetto who, in spite of a lot of trash talking and insults, really form an unoffical family and care about each other.
As for Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton's complains about this film, one of the actors in a recent interview noted that all that did was help them sell more tickets, as is often the case with controversial films.",1037404800,9,666,4.512396694214876

This is a great film. Honest, fresh, funny, emotional, soul sturring and just great plain entertaining. In this new modern world with movies that have to have special effects or sex scenes that have nothing to do with the story or mass murders with lots of blood and guts, it's refreshing to see a motion picture that is based on just a good script and actors that can deliver and keep the audience transfixed on the screen.  Now that is talent!  You will not be disappointed by this film unless of course your part of the modern generation that is basically brain dead and won't know anything about culture unless in came in the form of a drug. One of the great things about this movie is ""thinking for yourself, America.""  Again, this is a great film for ALL people.",1035331200,23,952,4.491329479768786
1795944,3,B00006RVJR,"""Barbershop"" has all the spontaneous, freeform looseness of good improvisational theater.  Indeed, the Mark Brown/Don D. Scott/Marshall Todd screenplay consists of little more than a series of fast-paced and witty conversations among some barbershop employees and their customers on the Southside of Chicago - with just enough ""plot"" thrown in to hold it all together.
This shop is more than just a place to have your hair cut - it functions as the agreed-upon location where the men of the neighborhood can come and have their say and propound their views on every possible topic, from politics to personal relationships, from race relations to the latest news from the local quarter.  It's when the conversation turns to politics that the writers really let loose, allowing one character, the aged and sage Eddie, to unload a volley of epithets aimed at some of the most revered sacred cows of the African American community.  Eddie, like most ""colorful"" characters, says exactly what he thinks and is allowed to get away with it.  His age and life experience give him a certain carte blanche to verbalize sentiments that no one else would dare to utter.  As such, he is a total refreshment in this age of super-sensitivity and political correctness.
The film really has two storylines going at the same time: one involving the theft of an ATM machine from a market across the street, and the other, the attempt by Calvin, the shop's owner, to renege on a deal to sell the place to a local loan shark who wants to turn it into a nightclub.  The former provides an opportunity for some low comedy, burlesque bits that are quite funny at times.  The latter gives the film its emotional depth, as Calvin comes to appreciate just what it is that makes this shop so very special a place.  Yet, it is when the film gets away from its plot and concentrates on the verbal sparring among its many characters that ""Barbershop"" is at its most incisive.
More than any film of recent memory, this one relies on what can truly be called an ""ensemble"" cast.  Each member is given a few key scenes or moments to sketch in his or her character before another one comes forth to usurp the spotlight.  Only Calvin, played endearingly by Ice Cube, and Eddie, brilliantly realized by Cedric the Entertainer, are allowed to attain more than their share of prominence.  However, despite being given less screen time, the rest of the cast is equally skilled in bringing their finely etched characters to life.  Director Tim Story does an effective job keeping this essentially one-set work from becoming ponderous and static, and he knows how to zoom in on just the right character at each given moment.
""Barbershop,"" though it may seem iconoclastic and even anti-establishment at times, ultimately comes out foursquare in favor of good, old-fashioned values like honesty, hard work and commitment to a dream.  The film may peter out a bit in its final scenes, winding up with a halfhearted resolution that shows, indeed, that the ""plot"" is the least important element to the filmmakers involved here.  These men obviously just love the characters they've assembled - and all that affection spilling off the screen is what makes ""Barbershop"" so much fun for us in the audience as well.",1034467200,4,3263,4.845323741007194
1795945,5,B00006RVJR,"In short, this is a film you should see. It's smart, it's funny, and it's good. All this despite the recent comments in the press from civil rights leaders and their relatives, who are angry about some of the lines in the film that are not as flattering as they'd like.
Most of the ""outrageous"" and controversial dialogue comes from Cedric the Entertainer, who plays the old and wise mentor of the barbershop. There really isn't all that much in the way of controversial talk, because the story is clearly focused on Calvin's crisis and how it relates to the theft of an ATM. While some of the famous civil rights leaders and their relatives that the film comments on may find it convenient to complain in the media, this can easily be disregarded as an attempt to become relevant in the 21st Century. Obviously, from their recent comments, you can tell that these people and their handlers have not seen the film. If they had, they would have seen a film rich in message about family, community, love, and responsibility; all virtues that they purport to espouse.
The straight talk about OJ, slave reparations, white ""homies"", Rosa Parks, and other topics affecting the black community past and present, is dead on. If only the leadership in the black community could be as frank! Would that more films and filmmakers would dare to be this open and honest on the topic of race.
Far from being a preach-fest, we have instead a warm, human comedy, with an excellent premise about community and responsibility to community. The analogy of barbershop AS community is never far out of view here. Cedrick's character makes this clear several times, as does the process of Calvin's conversion and his changing perspective about the shop his father left him. The shop is not just a shop, but a cauldron of community, ever bubbling and cooking away, purifying and refreshing.
All aspects of community are featured, both the welcome and the unwelcome. Even the bizzare phenomenon of the ""homie"", the white, black guy wannabe that litters all walks of life in our society, is discussed in an open, frank, and humorous manner (one character decribes such a ""homie"" co-worker as a ""minstrel show, knocked on it's ear"", while he replies the guy is just jealous, and wishes he had such a ""fly girlfriend and pimped-out ride."").
The straight talk is welcome, and measured carefully to avoid heavy-handedness in favor of common sense speak; just what you'd expect to get in the local barbershop. Best of all, the movie is funny. Not always knee-slapping funny, but funny in a warm and knowing way about people... ALL people.
Don't listen to the carping of the media hogs, politicos, or other ""talking heads"" on TV. See this film. You won't regret it.",1034467200,6,2734,4.794491525423729
1795946,3,B00006RVJR,"This movie was very funny at times but it was plagued with stereotypes and overused cliches.

Its OK to laugh at ourselves but the messages didn't really fit in and REALLY brought the comedy level of the movie down. There were
some good performances but some actors in this movie (not gonna name names) really need some acting lessons. Some were smirking while saying their lines (the director should have caught this). Cedric and Anthony Anderson were standouts as far as good performances",1033776000,2,637,4.962616822429907
1795947,4,B00006RVJR,"It was difficult for me to believe that a day in the life of a barbershop could be as enjoyable a movie as this turned out to be. The main action involves the barbershop that Calvin (Ice Cube) inherited from his father and how it seems incompatible with his dreams of success. The secondary plot involves several comedic scenes about a stolen ATM machine; this part of the story is cleverly interwoven into the resolution of Calvin's problems at the conclusion.
The story turns political correctness regarding race on its ear in only the way a black cast could. This includes a great illustration of reverse discrimination since the young white barber cannot convince any of the blacks that he can cut their hair. It also takes on such icons as Jesse Jackson and even Rosa Parks through humor rather than diatribe. Of course, the barbershop has been the neighborhood black social club for generations, and now it's existence is threatened. There are many twists and turns to the story and great character development of several of the minor parts. However, Cedric the Entertainer as the sage of the previous generation and bridge to the present staels the show in my opinion.
Definitely worth seeing if you want to both laugh and think while watching a movie where goodness and right eventually triumph and the value of friendship is reaffirmed.
I did not rate it five stars because while the lack of violence was very refreshing the language was unneccessarily offensive at times. Also, while I tremendously enjoyed the movie it was not so good that I would want to see it several times or purchase it on DVD.",1033776000,12,1610,4.774193548387097
1795948,1,B00006RVJR,This movie is a complete waste of time. There are absolutely no good moments on here. It is horrible. Do not see this movie. Save your money.,1033689600,4,141,4.2592592592592595
1795949,3,B00006RVJR,"Barbershop. Everybody said that this movie was great. Even all of the critics thought that it was warm,funny,and full of heart. I just didn't see what they meant by that. Yes,the movie did have it's funny moments and was heartwarming and made me feel good but the movie had no reason to be made. It could have been made into a television show and I would have liked it better. It didn't have that zing that you get with a movie. It floated around a little bit to get to that area of heavy emotions untill the end.the end of the movie was strange because when I walked out of the theatre I relized that I wanted to know more of what happens to those characters and thinking that they had to make a sequal just to find out what happens to the characters later in there life. That is the kind of feeling I got when I watched this movie.
The cast was very funny..but that is what i expected while watching this. I have never seen anything with Ice Cube in it but if he acts like he does in this movie I think he is a good actor. The rest of the cast I have never heard of but they were mostly good but in the end of the casting review I would have to say that Cedric the Entertainer steals the show. His speech in the middle of the movie has to be one of the funniest things that I have ever seen. He has always been a good actor but I think that his true acting talents were portrayed in this movie more then any other movie.
Ice Cube plays Calvin Palmer who owns his fathers old barbershop that is in debt and he is always trying to get rich quick. He lives with his pregnant wife Jennifer. For the past two years Calvin has owned the barbershop and is not happy with it. He decides to sell the barbershop to a loan shark named Lester Wallace without telling his wife or emplyees. His employees are also a fun part of the movie. There's Eddie who is a vertern barber,Jimmy James who is a college student who dislikes the white barber Issac who is a black wannabee,Terri who is upset about her boyfriend Kevin who cheated on her,Ricky who is under the careful watch of the police because he was an ex crimial type,and last Dinka who has a crush on Terri. Calvin watches throughout the day how much people love the barbershop and the misake he made and he tries to get it back. He thought Lester was going to keep it as a barbershop which is why he agreed to sell it but then he learns the Lester wanted to make it into a gentlemans club. Also a funny little slapstick subplot involving an ATM machine and two thieves who are looking for a big payday..but little did they know that the machine is new and hasn't been filled yet.
Barbershop is a movie that I would probally get for my DVD collection but I wish that I rented it before I payed the money in the theatres.
ENJOY!",1033603200,,2771,4.1716417910447765
1795950,4,B00006RVJR,"As I walked into a theater last night my my friend and his parents, we fouund ourself the only people in the theater, and it's a lovely theater, with stadium seating and surround sound. Eventually, a few more people walked in, but there were no more than a dozen people there. What I found funny is almost everybody there had different ethnic backrounds, but the one think that we did have in common: We loved Barbershop. Everyone was laughing. This is a perfect example of how the language of comedy is universal.  The plot itself was funny, including hilarious scenes surrounding a stolen ATM machine. While it was a little slow in the beginning, once it got moving, it was irresistible. Cedric the Entertainer absolutely steals the show in a hilarious performance. This was very original in a good way, in a way I'd like to see more of. I personally didn't really want to see this film, but I found it a rare gem. The movie is as funny as anyone has seen, but they haven't seen it in this original way. I my review makes you want to see it, but the ads make you hesitany, ask somebody who saw it. Feel free to five me a helpful/not helpful rating.",1033344000,8,1150,4.4245283018867925
1795951,5,B00006RVJR,"This was a really great movie.  Once again Ice Cube shown his acting/comedy skill. Check out ""Friday"" people if you need a refresher.  The cast is really a great mix of unknowns and super funny and entertaining celebs (i.e Cedric the Entertainer).  The setting was realistic, I don't think they could have did it any better, all of the barbershops I've ever been to remind you of just this type of setting.  The new rap queen Eve really shows just how versitial she can be. She does show just how it can be at times dealing with lifes obstacles.  And if you want to get a look at a real cutie keep your eyes of Michael Ealy ""Ricky"" I tell you can someone say TOTAL HOTTIE!! Overall the film was great, a good date flick, not one that I would let children under 14 see so parents be careful.  There is no nudity, just the occassional displays of strong language.  This will not be waste of time or money, so go see it and enjoy.  Hope that Michael Ealy makes more movies.  He's on his way!",1033257600,,988,4.268817204301075
1795952,5,B00006RVJR,"This movie is a highly entertaining story about hard working individuals attempting to earn their way in today's multicultural and ethnically diverse America.  Racism still exists but this evil has lost much of its bite.  One must still get up in the morning and meet the challenges of the day.  The world doesn't owe you anything and everything must be earned.  These people do not primarily see themselves as victims and readily admit that many of their troubles are self inflicted.  Calvin (brilliantly played by Ice Cube) wishes to get out of his late father's barbershop business.  He fails to comprehend that it still serves a valuable purpose in the neighborhood.  Calvin's  employees and customers at least tacitly perceive the barbershop as something of a Burkean mediating structure that binds them together.  The plot revolves around Calvin's foolish decision that puts this community institution in serious jeopardy.  Will everything work out at the end, or is the barbershop doomed?
Barbershop may also very well go down in history as the film that broke the back of political correctness.  The character Eddie portrayed by Cedric the Entertainer makes fun of the Liberal icons Rodney King, OJ Simpson,  Jesse Jackson, and even Rosa Parks.  The theater's mostly black audience roared in agreement and made further disparaging remarks especially about the Revered Jackson.  Barbershop deserves five stars and should be seen by everyone.  We can all identify with these less than perfect people who remind us of ourselves.",1033257600,10,1533,5.2
1795953,4,B00006RVJR,"A large group of friends and I went to see this movie tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised. One thing that detracts from this movie is the fact that it wasn't really as funny as I thought it would be. However, the spotlight of this movie is the heated discussions within the barbershop, between Cedric the Entertainer, Seann Patrick Thomas, Checker Freddy, and the White Barber.
We all know the plot by now, so I'll just say that while the subplot of the stolen ATM machine is pretty hysterical (and it does, in fact, serve a purpose) what I remember most is the different characters. This movie gives depth and dimension to a whole host of characters in a short amount of time, and I find that very impressive. There's the hothead unlucky-in-love Eve who is always going back to her nogoodnik lyin' cheatin' no-good scoundrel of a boyfriend, Checker Freddy, who's in cahoots with the infamous Eddie, played by Cedric the Entertainer. Ricky (I'm not sure of the actor's name but he is FINE, ladies, SO HOT) is a very interesting character, with a shady past, but a heart of gold. Seann Patrick Thomas plays a collegiate with a superiority complex. However, the character that steals my heart is the White Rapper. He's such a good character deep down that you'd love him if he was in FuBu and a dorag or a pinstripe suit with fedora. The final showdown between him and SPT (hee hee hee) is very gratifying.
It makes me happy to see a movie that portrays black people as a mature, well-informed and intelligent group of people. Characters are not looked down on, and they bring up very important issues in this movie. In the end, I felt very happy I'd gone to see this movie.
All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone. This movie is a joy to watch!",1033084800,4,1757,4.528301886792453
1795954,5,B00006RVJR,"This movie was great - from Cedic to the newcomers - it was hilarious!  In fact I'm going to see it again because I know I missed a few parts.  In regards to the commentaries on Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Jessie Jackson, etc. this is a movie based on the day to day happenings at a Barbershop - So I did not take it in any other form - JUST COMEDY & damn good!  Will be purchasing the video when it is released.",1033084800,,421,3.929411764705882
1795955,4,B00006RVJR,"Great film! This is a funny film, but, this is more than a Black comedy. This is a poignant story of understanding a legacy. Calvin, protrayed by Ice Cube, is a restless young man at a crossroad, deciding what he wants to pursue in life. He is a third-generation barbershop owner running a marginal business in the community. Frustrated to achieve more in life than his Father or Grandfather, we see him as a twice-failed businessman, looking to break away from running the barbershop and being 'just a barber'. By selling the business, getting out from the debt, and starting a recording studio business, he sees this as the path to this future. But, after selling the business, he then begins to realizes what the barbershop means to the community, the influence it has on the patrons, and the role his Father and Grandfather played in helping others for the past generations. He learns that this is the legacy that was pass on to him, and we see he is proud to accept that role.",1033084800,,981,4.611428571428571
1795956,2,B00006RVJR,"I rarely review films but this particular movie has received so much publicity I felt compelled to see it and further motivated to write about it.  The movie is set in a Southside Chicago barbershop owned by a typical Ice Cube character who has inherited it (and its debt) from his deceased father.  Cube decides to sell the shop to the neighborhood loan shark to pursue his true dreams of producing music.  Everything after this storyline is predictable  Cube changes his mind about the sale, the loan shark won't return the shop etc.  A parallel story line consist of the slap stick comedy of two characters who drives a truck into a convince store and steals the ATM.  This storyline is by far the funniest part of the movie, but its milked so much that it becomes ineffective.  Save for the comedic relief offered by the thieves, the movie is nothing more than an continuous display of racial stereotypes which, in a fully racialized American society, is funny to different people for different reasons.
The reasons for the objections raised in the media about the movies irreverent commentary on famous African American leaders and causes may have some validity.  While I certainly don't believe that African American leaders and public figures are beyond comedic reproach, I can understand how the dialogue in the film can be misunderstood.  It was clear to me that the entire dialogue on Rosa Parks, O.J. Simpson, etc. was deliberately written into the script to generate publicity.  Its stated in the movie by one of the characters that  what Im about to say is going to upset some people.  And upset it did.  So the media latches on - newspapers, radio talk shows, the CBS evening news  theres been no end to the discussions on the appropriateness of the remarks made in jest.  The result of the media exposure has proven to be very effective in promoting sales (over $40mm so far) but I don't think the movie is worthy of being taken so seriously.  Forward thinking, reasonably intelligent people will see the film for what it is, a sometimes-funny movie with poor acting, weak story line and about thirty minutes longer than necessary.  Backward thinking, shallow, racist, moviegoers may well see the film as validation of a host of stereotypes that they hold regarding African Americans and the Civil Rights movement. Regardless of the varied opinions of the movie, theres one thing Im certain of - the film producers are craftier at marketing than they are at filmmaking.  Unfortunately the success of their marketing is at the expense of a few highly revered African American historical figures. But such is the case with comedy . . . everythings funny as long as its happening to someone else.  You can wait on the video for this one.",1032998400,4,2749,4.798301486199575
1795957,5,B00006RVJR,"Well, let me talk about this movie here. Folks I know went before me, and since we had a storm here(Isidore),and I was off work, I figured the best thing to do was to see this movie and I wasn't disappointed. Now Ice Cube should have just held on and don't take no money from no loan shark. He was in that much of a problem to get the money from that source? And Cedric the Entertainer. Chile, he was too much. his comments on our civil rights leaders was cold. That is probably the only time I didn't care for the movie. Anthony Anderson and Larenz Tate as the two bungling ATM robbers brought quite a bit of laughs. Especially when one knows there is No money in it, and its seems inpenetratable to break in it. Eve cracked me up when she caught her boyfriend with a women, and the guy that was African and had a crush on her, that was so sweet. I enjoyed it,I felt good coming out of it, and I recommend it highly to others. Mostly because it wasn't violent and you could take your kids to see it, but with the controversy surrounding it, I still recommend it. You be the judge. Peace.",1032998400,,1088,4.161137440758294

This film is warm and touching, (he loves his wife and expected baby not many Dad's talk to the Mommie's belly to the baby)I loved the by-play between the other hairdressers in the shop and the feel that it was a friendly place to be.

1795960,5,B00006RVJR,"Barbershop is a very good look into the epicenter of the urban community, or what many recognize as the congregation center for male communication. This feature film from the team who brought us Soul Food, weaves the largest plot (keeping or selling the handed-down establishment) to the smallest plot (the bumbling antics of two very bad crooks). In the end, viewers will leave Barbershop with a belly full of laughs and a heart full of love.
The plot centers on Ice Cube's character that inherits the barbershop from his deceased father. Recognizing the tremendous debt that he is now responsible for, he can only see the shop as a burden. Ignoring the real value the barbershop holds as an age-old institution in the community, he accepts an offer from a neighborhood loan shark who plans to turn the barbershop into a strip joint.
With a superbly talented and diverse cast, Barbershop features some notable performances. Cedric the Entertainer reaches new comic heights as the 70-year-old barber turned mentor to the crew of ""Gen-X"" barbers. Rapstress Eve plays the only female barber with the occasional stank attitude that arises from either someone in the shop drinking her apple juice or the actions of her cheating boyfriend. Stepping out of his typical tough-guy characters, Ice Cube also hits the jackpot with this juicy role as a tormented man always looking for that next big break.
Watching the film and hearing the dialogue between the characters will remind male viewers of past barbershop experiences from childhood to adulthood. These experiences include everything from the older men who are fixtures within the barbershop, to the heated ""topic of the day"" that everyone weighs in on. And of course, no comment is ever spoken in soft tones.
Without giving anything away, Barbershop is a must see, must support film by all. If you ever wanted a taste of what goes on in your neighborhood barbershop, check this film out. It has everything but the pool table and the weight set in the back room!",1032652800,17,2012,4.938053097345133
