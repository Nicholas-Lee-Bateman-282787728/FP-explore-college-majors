8118332,5,B000F6ZI4C,"Pun intended this is a Glorious disc!  With choir, soloists, and Italy's' finest musicians performing in Venice finest church, this performance does A. Vivaldi proud.  After viewing this I can't imagine why Vivaldi is not always mentioned in the same breath as Bach and Mozart.",1502582400,,277,5.133333333333334
8118333,5,B000F6ZI4C,"Ahhhh this DVD is outstanding!
It puts me in the audience, not to forget mentioning the Artistic & Historical Place it is preformed in... Amazing Sound..  It's a  outstanding piece..Bravo",1433462400,,187,5.2
8118334,2,B000F6ZI4C,"The previous reviewer is correct.  The entire program was pre-recorded on audio, then played back as the entire ensemble from conductor and orchestra all the way to soloists and choir, mimed or lip-synched to hopefully (read: hopelessly) match the audio.

I have 'almost' (but not quite) gotten used to this deplorable practice when it comes to studio productions of opera video.  I had certainly not expected it here.  It really destroys any semblance of enjoying watching an ensemble perform.

I would have given one star, but I have to admit the recorded sound, the photography, the repertoire, the performance, and the setting (St. Mark's in Venice) are all very beautiful.  It's just that the video and audio don't match, and I daresay it appears to be distressing to the musicians taking part in this sham as well.",1390694400,,820,4.9489051094890515
8118335,3,B000F6ZI4C,"I don't know if it was just me. Very often, as I watching this DVD,I did not feel the singing in this video, especially the vocal solo, was ""natural"". The movement of their lips, facial expression, did not seem to match with the sound produced, although their voices were all quite good.",1238630400,4,287,4.538461538461538
8118336,5,B000F6ZI4C,"'I Solisti Veneti' have enjoyed a long and rewarding association with Claudio Scimone, and this is so obvious in the rapport of the musicians in these Vivaldi delights.  Combining with the ""Singakamie Choir of Vienna' they present a varied group of sacred music from the pen of the 'Red Monk'.  There are two Glorias - the better known RV589 and the RV562, both beautifully performed, Salve Regina RV 616 and Stabat Mater RY621, and two Concertos - RV581 and part of RV562.  Along with the Sonata Al Santo Sepolcro RV130 it provides the listener with a variety of glorious music.

Highly recommended for those who know Vivaldi, and for those who know only ""the Seasons' but who want to know more.",1151280000,10,696,4.7272727272727275
