253988,4,6300216861,"The late Margaux Hemingway saw her movie career take a nosedive after the release of this film, while her co-star and little sister Mariel became the toast of the town. But to many cinephiles, she'll always be remembered as the woman in red holding one mean rifle. Margaux plays Chris McCormick, a top fashion model (no stretch at all, here, since she really was a top model at the time) who ends up regretting her decision of having innocently invited her sibling's music teacher (Chris Sarandon of ""Fright Night"" fame) to her apartment. While she cries rape (with the help of Academy award winner Anne Bancroft as her attorney) the judicial system, however, sees it differently. LIPSTICK is the ultimate B-movie extravaganza. Raw to the bone, it is avant-garde cinema with a glossy exterior. David Rayfeil's script spares no details in degrading women via ultra-violent scenes (one a la ""The Accused"") and a misogynistic message regarding men and feminine beauty. But as a whole--and not too taken seriously--LIPSTICK is 90 minutes of pure fun. The film has a Russ Myer feel to it, a sort of cinema verite of the late 60's (the ones who lured mostly the male clientele). Margaux Hemingway gives all she's got and comes up almost rosy despite her limited range. She may not be Meryl Streep, but, contrary to popular opinion, her performance is believable. Of course, then-12 year old Mariel do steal the show with her quiet but strong delivery. Every nuance of her emotional face shows the making of a great actress, and she did become one for awhile, while her older sister stumbled and stumbled in forgettable Z flicks. LIPSTICK was indeed the apogee of Margaux's career. Far from being Academy award worthy, it is definitely a fave among lovers of cult movies, and with good reasons. Now all it needs is a deluxe DVD edition with all the extra goodies.-----Martin Boucher",1137628800,32,1875,4.8625
253989,4,6300216861,"This was a 1976 drama that probably killed Margaux Hemingway's career as an actress and model, but oddly enough launched her younger sister Muriel into the spotlight!  It's a rape drama about a victim (Margaux) who's rapist goes free (Chris Sarandon), and then attacks her younger sister (Muriel) and then all hell breaks loose!
The movie itself is a guilty pleasure - a potboiler melodrama done quite stlyishly, but somehow offensive and not well acted.  Would fit in well with a double bill with EYES OF LAURA MARS!  The fashion sequences are unique, and also the modern dance is neat to watch.  And Margaux running in heels and a red sequin dress with a hunting rifle is a sight to see!  I put it on my list of bad movies that I love.  It has a SHOWGIRLS sensibility!  Tried hard to be artsy and meaningful, but in the end was just too over the top to be anything but camp.
The DVD has a great transfer, but NO special features at all.  Not even a trailer!  Pity because Margaux died mysteriously, and this is her biggest movie.  Memories of her would be welcome as well as why the movie was made.  Credits show that a former DA of LA was an advisor, so somebody was trying to say something!",1069718400,12,1194,4.406392694063927
253990,3,6300216861,"It's far from being the best film ever made, but LIPSTICK has some special quality about it. Let's first look at the exceptional performances from the cast:
Chris Sarandon - plays the school teacher of the younger sister (Mariel Hemingway) who rapes the older sister first and then the younger sister after being acquitted of the first crime.  He really comes across as the creep he is intended to.  You grow to hate him, which is the point.
Mariel Hemingway - her acting debut in which she shines.  A great performance.
Ann Bancroft - plays the lawyer convincingly.  An all round great actress.
Margaux Hemingway - the lead actress, and real-life sister of Mariel (unfortunately died tragically in mid 90's). Not a great actress by any means but she had her moments in the film.  Pity about her voice.  She was actually a model in real life then, rather than an actress.
The film bombed upon release in 1976 possibly because audiences couldn't accept Margaux trying to switch to acting.  These days, such a movie would go straight to TV.
It is worth seeing at least once - The younger sister's performance is that good.
DVD SUMMARY - a bare bones release saved by an impressive transfer (and widescreen anamorphic too!).  No trailer included.",1069027200,12,1243,4.775700934579439
253991,5,6300216861,"Oh how I love this film! Margaux is divine as a high fashion model who is raped by her teen sister's school music teacher! Well she is not just raped, she is completely brutalised! I swear some of those scenes looked a bit too realistic. Chris Sarandon is absolutely devilish in the role of the sadistic rapist. He doesn't just physically overpower Margaux, he also attacks her mentally. After the deed is done he slyly begs of her to ""not do this with anyone else."" During the trial he also torments her with late night calls playing selections of his Phillip Glass inspired music. While the subject matter is serious the film is also high camp & truely hilarious! In an emotional (or as emotional as Margaux can get) courtroom scene she shouts out ""he tried to kill me with his c**k!"" Let us also not forget lil sis Mariel who gets attacked at the end of the film...after a high speed chase through the Pasadena Design Center! This pushes Margaux over the edge so she grabs a shotgun and goes after Sarandon with a vengeance! After pumping him full of bullets she just keeps pulling the trigger...it is AMAZING! Francesco Scavullo must be so proud.",1066867200,25,1150,4.587378640776699
253992,1,6300216861,"I saw this film for thne first time in 2001. Somebody I know bought this because they were interested to see it again after all of these years have passed. I watched it with them ... I still can't believe it today!
The acting is decent as a whole ... the Hemingway sisters, Chris Sarandon, Perry King & the great Anne Bancroft did a very good job giving what they had to do here. This movie upset so much after it was over & I still haven't quit thinking about it.
What this movie made women in this situation look like is ridiculous ... it makes all rape victims look like they are absolutely helpless & that he then went and raped Margaux's sister after he got off for the first rape (sickening) really did something to me. The music drove me crazy because it made the rape look & sound ever the worse for whatever reason.
And then to see Margaux's version of ""justice"" being served at the end ... what went wrong there? I read the previous review whan somebody said they stood up & cheered after this ... ? This makes her unfortunately just about as bad as her attacker.
You really will never get over seeing this movie. Please do both yourself & I a favor and don't EVER watch this. There are lots of great movies on this subject (The Accused comes to mind) that won't have this kind of effect on anybody.
My only question here ... were the writers, producers & director here  trying to put a point across, trying to accomplish something, or what? It didn't work; all this managed to do was upset me and make you really think about lots of BAD things. :(",1062460800,4,1558,4.299319727891157
253993,5,6300216861,"I hadn't seen this movie in 24 years.  I was ten years old when it came out on Hollywood Home Theatre (precurser to HBO), and I had to sneak downstairs to watch it.  Margaux Hemingway had the most alluring charm combined with an incredible sex appeal.  And her wonderful on-screen relationship with her sister only sealed the deal.  The movie has a very graphic scene in it, but it isn't nearly as bad as anything considered 'mere' entertainment by today's standards.  The obsession that takes place in the movie is very real and incredibly well-acted.  Also, Ann Bancroft's interjects an amazing presence before ever appearing on the screen. I saw a preview for some of Mariel's current work and the first thing that popped into my head was 'Lipstick', so I bought it and watched it again. You will love this movie - period.",1019347200,8,825,4.694444444444445

254095,5,6300216861,"Lipstick was one of those movies that the audiences simply were not ready for, in the late 70s.  Surprisingly, this movie is not some glamour thriller that it was labled.  For me, this is clearly a movie about the horror of rape.  People knew about rape at this time, but it was a very taboo subject for victims who suffered from it.  The movie should be applauded for telling a story of a rape victim who, as always seemed to be the case, falsely accused of ""bringing it on herself"".  Though it has some weak spots, overall the film works.  Too bad it was panned so badly by critics and the public that year, and only had modest success on vhs and late night tv.
Margaux Hemingway suffered the worst and unfairly.  I thought her performance was great.  But the problem, for her anyway, was the weak screenplay.  It simply did not give her enough to work with.  I was left feeling that I didn't really have a clear idea of who she was.  How was she supposed to play a character with any kind of emotion, dimension, etc.  when the screenplay didn't give her the words or the scenes or the lines to give her something to work with??.  We are left with ""a model who is raped because of lipstick advertisements"".  A good example is the film's beginning throwing Hemingway on some rocks, nude, no lines....without any scenes showing that she is a human being.  Crazy, i tell you.  What's worse...there are no scenes showing the character's pain, humiliation an confusion about actually being raped.  afterwards, Hemingway looks like someone who just panicked and called the cops, hearing a sounds in her bedroom closet.  Heminway goes to see a priest to talk about what happened....Priest:  How do you feel?......Hemingway:  i feel angry.....i mean, really, is this what the writers thought a rape victim experienced....a little bit of anger and confusion?  This is not Hemingway's fault.  It's amazing that she could create any character at all with this idiocy.
Thankfully, Hemingway can get somewhere with the character through the other actors.  Chris Sarandon played the transvestite lover of Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon....and his imagination and talent works here as well.  The character is nowhere near the subtlety or depth of , say, Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver....but you get the gist that Sarandon is bringing something unique to the part.  A troubled musician who tapes birds as compostions....?  Sarandon takes this, and pretty much knocks it out of the park.
Lo and behold....we have the phenomenal Anne Bancroft as the heroic, intelligent and frighteningly angry lawyer who defends Hemingway.  Bancroft steals every scene she is in, as always.  Bancroft, talent that she is, obviously knew all the information about rape and how the victim is treated.  Her range of emotion in the scene talking to Heminway with two other men is astonishing.  She comes across as angry but not cruel.  She is there to help Hemingway....but she doesn't hold back from making her realize how difficult it will be.  Bancroft does not have many scenes but she's unforgettable.
Oddly enough...the story's perspective is really being told by Hemingway's smart sister...played by Mariel Hemingway.  Margaux fought to get her sister the part and Mariel's performance is devastating.  Like Jodie Foster, it's hard to believe that Mariel is so self aware....so intelligent for her age to give us a character that is so heartbreaking, whose innocence is completely destroyed.  Her scenes in the courtroom are the work of a true actress.  When she witnesses Hemingway in bed with the rapist....her facial expression goes right through you.  It's no surprise that Mariel would go on to movies like Manhatten and Star 80.  She simply has that rare gift.  a natural.
Hemingway, sadly, has only one scene where we see raw emotion, rage....she is at once dangerous and almost uncontrollable.  in a scene that could have ended up being campy.....Hemingway takes it all the way into a powerful act of revenge and defense of her kid sister.  Finding that the rapist has put some moves on her daughter...Margaux loses control to the point of grabbing a rifle used for sport....and blows the son of a bitch away, shooting him at least 5 or 6 times.  she stands with the rifle in her hand....not showing vindication....but utter sadness.
Lipstick was too far ahead of its time.  The script was written, or at least it seems....more of a showcase for Margaux as a model, than for a shattering story about rape.  Hemingway was a huge star at the time....and movies do make the mistake of selling the star before anything else.  Rape wouldn't be addressed again, like this on the big screen until the movie The Accused.  Overall, Lipstick does work.  It is a powerful drama that exposes a horiffic nigtmare.  But if you cant really show us what the victim feels.....what is there?  I would imagine after filming....Margaux Hemingway may have felt the same.  And that sucks.",1424131200,2,4945,4.856459330143541

254118,5,6300216861,I remember when this first came out and all of the controversy over a child playing this kind of part with this subject matter. All of that drama aside it was an extremely good movie. I had been looking for a long time and everytime I found one they wanted anywhere from &75- $100.

254119,3,6300216861,"I saw this in theaters back when it was first released and it always stuck with me. Margaux of course got totally slagged for her acting chops and all the attention went to little sis. Seeing it again nearly 40 years later, while it's no masterpiece I think poor Margaux got an unfair shake for her first role. I think her voice, which I always found sexy makes her sound a little cartoon like. If you view it as kind of a guilty pleasure and a look at it's 70's style and attitude it's worth 3 bucks if you are bored. The rape scenes are pretty tough to take even now. Chris Sarandon is very good as psycho rapist/teacher and of course Mariel Hemingway launched a nice career pretty much by accident since sis insisted on her being in the movie. Kind of sad seeing again knowing how Margaux's life turned out.",1419465600,,810,4.3355263157894735

254227,5,6300216861,"Margaux Hemingway turns in an extraordinary performance as high-fashion model Chris, who is sexually assaulted by her sister Kathy's music teacher, Gordon Stuart portrayed brilliantly by Chris Sarandon.

It's really a shame this film has been unjustly panned by critics.  I was enveloped in the story & consider this to be one of the best films of the 1970s.  Margaux should have received much praise for her work in this production.  Her performance as the victim who ultimately exacts revenge on her assailant was truly remarkable.",1295222400,4,533,5.162790697674419
254228,3,6300216861,"Margaux Hemingway is a model who does photo shoots to promote lipstick sales. Her sister, a much younger Mariel Hemingway, co starred with Margaux in it too. Chris Sarandon in the film is Mariel's music teacher who is permitted by Margaux to watch a shoot on the beach in the beginning of the movie. Margaux invites him to her apartment to listen to various musical themes he records on a cassette tape. The music sounds extremely bizarre and hideous. When Chris comes up to see Margaux in her apartment, she is in the middle of taking a shower when he is called up by the doorman of the building, but she allows him to come up anyway. Margaux grabs her robe, brushes her hair and ties it in a bun. When she opens the door to let him in, she apologizes for not being ready and courteously offers him a beer. Then they sit down on the couch in the living room and he turns on the tape recorder with the weird music he recorded for her to hear, but then it is interrupted by a phone call she answers. He starts getting agitated and looks around the house at all the celebrities she met and got autographs from. After Margaux tells Chris to hang up the phone when she picks up the other phone, all things start getting quite heated when Chris walks into her bedroom and grabs a picture of a priest who happens to be Margaux's brother in the movie and smashes it with his foot, she orders him to get out but then all hell breaks loose when he pushes her onto her bed and forces kisses on her, she kicks him off of her but he grabs hold of her and knocks her around. Then he yells at her, demanding her to tell her where her red lipstick is and in a battered daze, she mumbles to him that it's in the bathroom in the medicine cabinet. He tears off her robe, breaks the bathroom mirror and when he finds the lipstick, he colors her mouth with it and then she ends up in the bedroom again, this time he ties her up and sodomizes her with the insane music playing right next to them. Her sister comes home and walks in on them after the act is over and then leaves the room. I am a woman and this movie made me furious not only because he is acquitted and the abuse Margaux's character endures on the witness stand, but the cruelty Mariel's character goes through at the hands of the defense attorney, not to mention Mariel was only 10 or 11 years old and  it doesn't matter if this was only a movie, it's the principle. Anne Bancroft is the prosecutor in the movie and she was so kind and compassionate to Margaux's character. These kind of things also happen in real life to kids who are in that age group when they are interregated by the police and they intimidate them into falsely confessing that somebody close to them committed a crime. This movie enforces how society lets men get away with any kind of sexual assault against a woman, therefore, it exploits feminism. Anyhow, at the end of the movie, Mariel's character is attacked by Chris's Character and Margaux's character avenges her sister by shooting him to death. When Margaux is arrested and is on trial, ironically Anne Bancroft quits her career as a prosecutor and is Margaux's defense attorney. The ultimate outcome of the film is that Margaux is found not guilty for murdering Chris Sarandon's chararcter. I was glad that Margaux was acquitted in at the movie's conclusion, but I would have really loved to see Chris Sarandon's character live and possibly wind up paying for the crime he committed towards Margaux Hemingway.",1275436800,4,3488,4.416149068322981
254229,4,6300216861,"Lipstick starring Margaux Hemingway, Mariel Hemingway, and Chris Sarandon is a strange film about rape. Margaux was not exactly the best actress in the world but boy she was one beautiful lady. Her real-life kid sister, Mariel had the acting gene but Lipstick is so bad, it's good! The rape scene is difficult to watch of course, but the way the court system attacks women who have been raped is just horrible and realistic I am embarrassed to say. I give this film 4 stars because of the amazing, unexpected ending - Margaux Hemingway in a gorgeous red dress gunning down her rapist, Hollywood magic at its finest.
