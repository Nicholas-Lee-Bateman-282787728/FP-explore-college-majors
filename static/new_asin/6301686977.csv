344315,4,6301686977,"Bonanza is the famous television western series, set in the vicinity of Virginia City, Nevada, during the years of the Civil War, soon after the discovery of the fabulous Comstock Silver Lode. Bonanza is the saga of the  Cartwrights, a prosperous family of ranchers. The stories relate their  struggles for justice amidst violence and lawlessness as they attempt to  maintain and operate their timberland ranch, known as the Ponderosa Ranch.  Many of these classics were produced in the early years of filmmaking. This  means that primitive audio recording technique will be more noticeable in  the DVD format, so will glitches in picture. These movies (""Desert  Justice"" & ""Badge Without Honor"" have been rescued from  the film vaults in most cases and have not been restored. ""Desert Justice""  is the story of Dave Walker, one of Ben's ranch hands. Dave is accused of  murdering the wife of Marshall Dowd. After the Cartwrights discover that  Dave was beaten while in jail, they decide to accompany him to Los Angeles  where his trial is to be held. ""Badge Without Honor"" is about a man named  Gerald Eskith who comes to town claiming to be a Deputy Marshall. He wants  to take the Cartwrights friend Jason Blaime to San Francisco to testify  against the Murdock Gang. Adam, however, has his suspicions and decides to  go along with them..... On the DVD (one episode on each side) you'll also  find Interactive Menus, Interactive Film Trivia about Bonanza and  information about the actors.  A pity is the missing well-known  ""Bonanza""-tune. Now all the episodes start with a nasty kind of  music.  See Lorne Greene as Ben Cartwright, a three time widower; Pernell  Roberts as his eldest son Adam; big Dan Blocker as son Hoss; Michael Landon  as the youngest son, Little Joe. It's nice to see all the famous characters  back on the screen.",934675200,24,1841,4.89935064935065

344369,5,6301686977,"Bonanza:A Rose For Lotta/The Truckee Strip is a nice tape. A Rose For Lotta has Yvonne De Carlo as guest star, at the height of her beauty. It is the pilot and the first Bonanza episode run in 1959. She does a nifty song and dance on the stage in Virginia City. The Truckee Strip features an early appearance by James Coburn.

344428,5,6301686977,I enjoyed the DVD's of Bonanza. They were good quality and were the earlier episodes that are seldom shown on TVLand.,1184198400,,117,4.619047619047619

344432,3,6301686977,"While I loved watching the episodes included, I could only give the collection three stars, as it does tend to freeze, especially disc three for me, and due to episodes not being the full episodes. I noticed while watching, The Courtship, that the episode had been edited heavily thus really ruining it. I would recommend the set, but I would also have to say that it might be better to just wait for them to re-air again on TV Land, or any western television channel. Also the packaging could be better. The discs can be tricky to get out the box.

On the plus side, all the episodes are early ones featuring Pernell Roberts as Adam Cartwright. You'll notice that David Canary (Candy) is on the cover, and this I believe is human error, as Pernell is featured on the small photograph on the side of the box. The original Bonanza theme is intact, though you will hear, if you don't make a selection, the other Bonanza them start to play. The map is the only thing that is not from the originals, but its okay, and the water color pictures are at the end credits, though I only noticed them on discs four and five.

I also have Bonanza Vol. 1, as it features 8 uncut episodes, and I highly recommend that all Bonanza fans buy that. As for my final analysis of Bonanza 20 Episodes, if you don't mind things being cut and just love to watch the Cartwrights, I say buy. If you want full episodes with nothing cut-out, wait.",1142640000,14,1419,4.391634980988593
344433,5,6301686977,"This is an excellent dvd.  It is a must for anyone who likes westerns. If you have watched the Bonanza originals or reruns, it is Bonanza at it's best.  These are shows the whole family can watch.",1141776000,5,196,4.27027027027027
344434,4,6301686977,"While I agree that the case itself requires a bit of care when removing the DVDs, the value of this set more than makes up for this small issue.

Yes, 20 full-length episodes of Bonanza on 5 DVDs (4 episodes per double-sided DVD), for less than $20! I've watched 8 episodes so far, and the quality of these episodes are as good as the ones shown on TV Land. I've yet to notice any glitches or color issues. Plus, these episodes are early ones with Adam (Pernell Roberts), with the original title sequences and all!

I recommend this set to any Bonanza fan.",1138406400,5,556,4.388349514563107
344435,4,6301686977,"First off i have to say that this is a great collection for the money. You really can't go wrong if you're a fan of Bonanza or Westerns in general.

However be forewarned that the packaging is probably the worst i have EVER seen in a box set of dvds. Everytime i try to get one of the dvds out of the plastic holders it feels like they're going to snap in half. My advice is to put each dvd into a cd case and throw away the case it comes with.

Also an important thing to mention is that at times the recording is a little glitchy - occasionally i've seen short skiping. (a second at the most)

Despite the problems this is still a great purchase.",1107129600,28,648,4.046875

344467,1,6301686977,"The cover's kinda nice, though that's the only positive thing I have to say about this company's attempt to make money off of the classic series. ""Bonanza"" began in 1959, not 1958.  It's producer was David Dortort, not David Dortot. The episodes on this DVD are nowhere near the first episodes of the series.  I suggest waiting until Republic - Artisan - Lions Gate realizes there's a big market for ""Bonanza"" done the right way on DVD and releases the definitive DVD collection (beyond the ""Best of"" 8-episode DVD they released a year or so ago).",1103500800,13,547,4.6875

344504,4,6301686977,"I don't really have this dvd, but I've seen all five episodes. Two of them, Desert Justice and Badge Without Honor, are boring. But I like the other three. Silent Thunder is about Little Joe teaching a deaf girl that also can't understand anything to talk in sign language. But he needs the help of the girl's dad. The Last Viking includes Hoss's uncle, and The Blood Line is a very emotional episode about Ben killing a boy's dad in self defense and having to bring the boy back to normal.

The sound and picture are not of very good quality..A great dissapointment is the absence of the classical Bonanza soundtrack....
They could have put more than just 1 episode per disk..I hope they will do that in future collections....
A major disadvantage in my opinion is the absence of subtitles of any language..This is very importand especially for shoppers outside US like me...
