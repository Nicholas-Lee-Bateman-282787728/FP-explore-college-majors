2967146,5,B000WE5I2Y,This anime is great. The graphics can't be any better. Vampires never looked so good! Am not exadurating it's real impressive. However the ending is the one thing I would change.

2967147,4,B000WE5I2Y,"This is a great anime, although at times the story arcs feel a bit rushed, the process of watching this show is enjoyable.  The characters are likeable and the animation is very cool.

My only disappointment with the series was the rushed ending... there seemed to be some pretty significant build up and one would have expected it to be a pivotal moment, but it was over and done with when it felt like it should have just begun.

Despite that, I hold this series close to my heart and recommend it to fans of vampires and Gothic looking anime.",1212451200,,545,4.43
2967148,4,B000WE5I2Y,"The animation in this is really top of the heap. If you are impressed with the box you won' t be disappointed with the animation.

The box set this comes in is about as nice as you can get IMHO. The only other box set I own that is nicer is the complete box set for Basilisk. The packaging is done with remarkable thoughtfulness. It almost reminds me of opening apple products, almost.

The price is a bit heavy. But I think it balances itself out.

If you like Trigun you will enjoy this. Though the humor is toned down and this tends to be a little darker. I see this as a cross between Crono Cruisade and Trigun.

The story telling could have been a bit better but it was good overall.

I would argue that they didn't really play items against each other well enough to really impact you.

An example of this (slight spoiler): Someone has a love interest in the main character and she dies. The main character's mourning is TRIGGERED by the death of the beloved friend but is POWERED by his memories of someone else... how is that for an insensitive jerk! LOL

In the end his brooding doesn't seem like a sincere act over the loss of such a close loved one.

That being said:
The action is good.
The humor is fun.
The overall artwork is just beautiful to look at.
The characters are developed well.
The music is solid.
Did I mention the art is just great?
The story concept is solid too. (An Uber vampire that feeds on vampires... fun little recursive cannibalism thing going on there.)

Would I buy this again? Yes.
Would I try to find it cheaper? Absolutely
Is it a solid show to watch? Yes
Will you be disappointed? I don't think so.",1204329600,14,1639,4.312703583061889

2967152,5,B000WE5I2Y,"Three cheers for beautiful anime box sets. The format of the ""Trinity Blood"" set is so nice it's almost like a modern illuminated manuscript.
But the pretty box is nothing compared to the story contained within.

The anime of ""Trinity Blood"" is a cobbling together of the stories in the light novels and the manga with an underlying plot involving the delicate transition between the conflict of the humans and the vampires to a balance of peace. It can appear to be haphazard in places, but overall the story follows a steady course to its conclusion and it has become one of my favorite anime.

The characters carry the events better than many stories I've seen. It is the changes in them that prove to be the most powerful points of the plot. Keep your eye on Esther and Alessandro, both of whom go through the most poignant transformations. My favorite scene in the entire show is towards the end when Alessandro blesses the little vampire girl's pet rabbit. You see him realizing for the first time that he has the potential to change the world, and he wants to change it for the better. There is power in simple moments like that.

And then, of course, there's Abel, who is just too weird to be believed. You find yourself completely engrossed in his character as he seems to flip back and forth from one aspect of his personality to the next in an almost schizophrenic pattern yet all the while perfectly maintaining his sympathetic humanity. I mean, watch this guy. He's so goofy and then he transforms into this nightmarish super-vampire, chopping villains down with a giant scythe (complete with a choir in the background! It's so much fun!).

Anime. Ya gotta love it. That kind of wild melodrama is all part of the awesome experience.

All the AX members have their own distinct personalities and they play off each other with archtypical perfection. Wordsworth the Bumbling Genius, Kate the Gentle and Stolid, Leon the Lovable Rogue, Hugue the Strong and Silent, Tres the Deadpan Android, Noelle the Elegant and Unrequited, Havel the Mysterious and so on and so forth, with Abel at the center as a kind of catch-all personality that they can bounce off of. It's very entertaining.

And if you like big epics with big plots, this is the story for you. It's beautiful to watch, full of elaborate backgrounds and animation. The history and mythology is complex and multi-faceted with all kinds of hidden surprises to discover. You get the impression that you've only just scratched the surface of what lies beneath. I've always had great admiration for stories like that. I never watch anime in Japanese. The subtitles are annoying. (I know, scandal to the purists) But I have nothing but good things to say about the actors chosen to voice the English version. I'd say the best performance is Troy Baker, simply because of the challenge of providing Abel with so many personality facets.

All in all, it's just a very well crafted story, unique and fascinating. Best of all (in my opinion at least) the series ends with the opening of a new chapter in the mythos. Esther is crowned and she and Alessandro stand poised to reign in a new era of peace with the Methuselah. And Abel begins his ultimate quest to rid the world of the threat of his brother Cain and the Rosen Kreutz. I like to know that the story will continue, even if I might never know what will happen. It gives a sense of satisfaction to see one door close and another open.

(This does, admittedly, make the ending feel a little rushed and cut-off, but bear in mind that Sunao Yoshida died suddenly before he was able to finish the novel series. A writer collegue of his brought the series to an end with the last book but who knows if that would've been the end if Yoshida had lived.)

I'm glad to see ""Trinity Blood"" in a box set. It will be up to each person individually whether or not the story is to their tastes, but from where I stand it's a story that no one will regret experiencing.",1196035200,66,3970,4.603960396039604

2967154,4,B000WE5I2Y,"I loved watching this, because, to me, it was amazing to see how the legends we grow up with look through the filter of a slightly different perspective. There is much that is absolutely amazing about this series -- the art, some of the characters, and the potential of this story -- and there is some that was not as good as it could have been. All in all, though, it was a highly enjoyable series.

The story is as follows (spoilers):

There are three races of humans:
- Humans (Terrans): humans...
- Methusalehs (Vampires): humans who need blood/blood substitute to survive. Vampire is an impolite term commonly employed by ""regular"" humans to denote this form of human. The Methusalehs have an extended life span and far greater power than common man. Methusalehs were created by humans experimenting on other humans.
- Crusnik: humans who survive on the blood of vampires, Crusnik live longer even than vampires, and are far more powerful. They, too, were the result of human experimentation. There were only four created -- Abel Nightroad, and his three siblings, Cain, Seth and Lilith

The main plot of the story is a struggle between Abel, and, on his side, the Church and humanity, and his brother (thought to be dead), Cain, and the clandestine Rosen Krutz Ordern. 900 years prior to the main story, as humanity broke into warring factions, the siblings chose different sides -- Lilith on the side of the Terrans, and the rest on the side of the vampires. Cain, after a life-saving operation turned him mad, murdered Lilith, and Seth and Abel in turn killed (they thought) Cain. Alas, but Cain ""undied"" a second time (not so, however, for poor Lilith who, once condemned to the grave, was condemned for all eternity). After Armageddon, and 900 years of mourning, Abel emerges, vowing to protect humans.

The Pope -- a young, whiny boy who is easily bullied by his older brother -- resides in Rome; his chief advisers are his sister, who diligently strives to keep humanity on the right course, and his brother, who -- being himself barred by illegitimate birth from direct access to papal power -- effectively wields the power of the papacy through his younger sibling. Abel works for the sister as a member of her elite branch, the AX; he often finds himself at odds with the pope's brother's Inquisitors, however.

A series of quests (many downright absurd) directs Abel to the truth of his brother's continued existence, and involvement with the Rosen Krutz Ordern. Along the way, he must confront his promise that he would never harm a human again and again (often choosing to indirectly cause thousands, perhaps millions, of deaths in order to directly maintain his vow). The same, however, is not true for vampires, whom he slaughters whenever the need arises. For these reasons, Abel's character can be very annoying at times, as he comes across as both spineless and stupid. While I get that he wants to protect humanity, as that was his dead sister's goal, the fact that vampires were a product of human experimentation - and are despised and persecuted by humans, despite the fact that they rely on a blood substitute and so [with the exception of rogue murderers] do not prey on humans  - seems to me to indicate that theirs is the more just side. But, Abel is Abel...

Abel's work brings him in contact with many people, Terran and Methusaleh, as well as his sister, Seth (the Crusnik). These characters are generally very interesting, and add much to the story (although, again, some of them are stupid...as with Wendy and Peter, and the ""Tinkerbell System"" episode). One of the interesting characters is Esther Blanchette, Abel's human love interest; another is Count Ion Fortuna, his Methusaleh rival for Esther's hand. The most interesting quests in the series come probably half way through, when Abel is in contact with the New Human Empire (the kingdom of the Methusalehs).

All in all, I give this series 4/5 stars. If not for some of the weaponry/quest-lines, which were beyond the level of absurdity acceptable even in fantasy, I would have given it 5/5...despite those, however, this was a very interesting anime series, full of complex characters and riveting episodes. Oh, and a final note...I highly recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles (if you don't speak the language)...the English dubbing was horrendous...",1296259200,,4372,4.898648648648648

I wasn't disappointed! It's alot of history mixed in with vampire lore, which draws you in and make you want to take a closer look. At first, I thought Abel Nightroad(the main character) was just a bumbling priest until I saw him turn into a crusnik. Then, I was like; okay..... I can get into this. The anime is excellent, the story lines draw you in and some of the characters you'd love to hate.

2967161,1,B000WE5I2Y,"I feel like I'm watching Trigun all over again and this time I hate it.

The one thing I hate about anime is that the keep recycling shows over and over again. Gundam copies from the previous series over and over again. All romance anime copy from each other. I know, I know most people who've watched enough anime already know this. I don't always have a problem with it.

For example Gundam Seed, it copies the almost exact story line from the orginal Mobile Suit Gundam which came out over 20 years ago. I gave it a 8, it gave me a couple of new things to keep me watching. That's what I want from a show that almost copies everything from a differnt anime. Now to a show that doesn't. For example Gundam Seed Destiny. It compies everything from Moble Suit Gundam and Gundam Seed, and does the same thing in every episode with nothing new to the story. It also goes on for another 50 episodes, I mean come on. This show was a complete waste of time. That's why I gave it a 1.

I just need to explain one of the reasons why I am giving Trinity Blood a 1. Trinity Blood is a rip off of Trigun. When Trigun came out in 1998 it was original anime. I've never seen anything like it before then. I gave it 5 stars, and even now it's one of the best anime I've seen, I still watch it at least once a year. Trinity Blood is just Trigun recycled eight years later. Able Nightroad is a exact copy of Vash. He acts the same and has the same past. I truly like the story of a kingdom of Vampires and humans living right beside each other. If they made a anime about that it could have been great, but instead they made it about Able aka Vash, and it turned into crap. I would recommend you skip this show and instead see what Trinity Blood copied from a classic in Trigun.",1240704000,5,1763,4.119186046511628
2967162,3,B000WE5I2Y,"Well, I've finally seen Trinity Blood and I have to agree with most of the professional critics...it's no masterpiece. It's fun though, even with its flaws: The story is full of emotional twists and turns, some of which make sense and some of which will leave you scratching your head. In either case, the depiction of these suffers from a complete lack of subtlety. This anime is just too wildly overdramatic for its own good--many of its intended touching moments just inspire eye-rolling or even laughter. Don't even get me started on the series' ending...just pure craziness. These things said, the production is pristine, with lush backgrounds and lovely character designs and if you take this anime with a pinch (or perhaps a big, heaping bowl) of salt, you'll have a good time.",1233360000,5,784,4.902255639097745

2967175,4,B000WE5I2Y,"** MINOR SPOILERS **
If you love vampires, Papal conspiracies, lots of Biblical symbolism, as well as excellent animation... then this is the series for you. Trinity Blood is a visually stunning series. The settings and character designs are lovely. The music is really quite good (not as good as a Yoko Kanno series, but what is), especially when Able changes into his Avenging Angel form. It's obvious the animators and production staff took a lot of time and TLC putting so much detailed work into this series.

Many of the characters are more than a bit stereotypical... the hero, Able - complete with a dark and mysterious past. His sort of ""love interest"" Esther - a damsel CONSTANTLY in distress - also hides an equally dark and mysterious past, but somehow it makes them more endearing... except for the fact that Esther is CONSTANTLY SCREAMING when there is the least bit of danger. Able should duct tape her mouth shut or do some kind of vampire mind-control trick to get her to take it down a few decibels.

My one regret with the series is that the rather large ""supporting cast"" was not given more time to develop. My understanding is that the creator of Trinity Blood passed away during production of the first season and someone else took over creative control in order to see that it was finished. In this series, the supporting cast is more than that. I found many of them to be at least as interesting as the two main characters. For a partial list: there's Seth - the Vampire Queen who looks looks like a 7 year old little girl, Father Tres - the android, Father Hugue - the unruly Sword Dancer, as well as the three siblings who make up the Triumvirate of the Papacy are fascinating. In my opinion, the relationships between the members of the Triumvirate: Alessandro XVIII (the actual pope - looks about age 10-12), Francesco di Medici - Alessandro's older, scheming half brother, and Caterina Sforza - Alessandro's protective older sister are one the most fascinating aspects of the entire series.

You know a series is good when it leaves you wanting to know more about characters and the overall story. This anime fits the bill. So you know where I'm coming from: Blood+, Wolf's Rain, Bleach, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Last Exile are among my personal favs.  Trinity Blood definitely ranks right up there. To wrap up... is it the best? No, but despite the semi-lame ending it's very good, and really a great way to spend a snow day.",1232236800,2,2485,4.666666666666667

This is maybe the best anime I have seen so far! The first series that got me into anime! Trinity Blood was, to put it into simple words, amazing! I don't think that the word amazing does this anime justice though! I am not a big Christian or anything but this anime is beautiful and amazing in all sorts of ways! It's too bad that this may be the very last of it although there is another set of books that continue this story! I would love to see how Abel and Ion go on and I bet they beat Cain! Vampire galore! If you love vampires, anime, blood, and you are a catholic you should fall in love with this anime! It's amazing! I'm so happy that I found this on Cartoon Network! Everyone I know who loves anime loves this anime too! I recommend this for anyone who loves anime, shojo or shonen! There is a ton of secret love, or so it seems, in this whole series. Everything in this all the emotion and drama of the storyline is amazing. I am truly honored that this is the very first real anime that I watched. When I say real anime I mean these are things that can happen in the future, not Pokemon or Digimon that I used to like, and honestly still do as long as it's the first season of either of them. This anime has an amazing storyline and everything. Again I am honored for this being my first anime that I watched that really triggered my anime need. I recommend this for anyone absolutely anyone because it is that good, it's amazing, very simply amazing!  Thank you for bringing this to me, Funimation! It is too bad that the author passed away though. Because I bet this could go on forever and be amazing, unlike the newer Pokemon and Digimon!",1222732800,,1682,4.269592476489028
2967179,4,B000WE5I2Y,"The actual box set itself is well put together..I was impressed. I sat down and watched the 1st four discs then had to get some sleep before work. The first few episodes are great then it slows down on the second disc and then picks back up on the third.
 The animation is good as is the story and the only things that I can complain about are...
 #1 Abel (the Priest) is kind of Clark Kent & Barney Fife rolled into one character for many episodes, until threatened. At first you perceive it as a cover for who he is but as it goes on it seems to be his real personna.
 #2 Abel does not become his signifcant other near enough. I think some episodes not at all.
  I got out of watching ANIME for many years and that style of character has always been around...the goofy type of person. There are episodes where they get away from Abel being a goof and he takes a much more serious approach to life. Which is a good thing.
 I think it could have been better but if something were to happen to my set...I would buy it again.
 My two complaints are very minor indeed..do not get my wrong. I really enjoy this...it is dark, sets a mood,good action and introduces new characters here and there so you never get bored with everybody is the same episode after episode.
 I have seen it 3 times.. it has great replay value. So far it is one of the best series that I have. Granted I only have 80 or so complete series yet out of what I have...Elfen Lied..Black Blood Brothers..several Gundams..Death Note..Last Exile.. Hellsing..Gunslinger Girl..Full Metal Panic/Alchemist..Jyu-Oh-sei and a multitude of others. This is in the top 3.
 Not to mention that the box itself is a thing of beauty..all discs have great work on them & the disc cases are very well done. I did not like the fact that they have 2 discs in each case. They put them one on top of the other instead of something like a thin pack where they will out one on each side of the case.
 Oh....also when I put in discs 3 & 4..they were not in surround sound. Yet if you go into Audio put it on Surround 5.1..hit ""Enter"" subtitles on or off..""Enter"" it puts you back to the main menu and everything played fine from there.

The first twelve episodes are the basis of the novels Rage Against the Moons and Reborn on the Mars one and two while also introducing characters that are introduced in later novels. The last twelve deal with the second series ROM, novels 3,5 and 6, skipping the 4 novel in that series.

Despite that, I hold this series close to my heart and recommend it to fans of vampires and Gothic looking anime.",1212451200,,545,4.43
3201645,4,B000WE5I2Y,"The animation in this is really top of the heap. If you are impressed with the box you won' t be disappointed with the animation.

The box set this comes in is about as nice as you can get IMHO. The only other box set I own that is nicer is the complete box set for Basilisk. The packaging is done with remarkable thoughtfulness. It almost reminds me of opening apple products, almost.

The price is a bit heavy. But I think it balances itself out.

If you like Trigun you will enjoy this. Though the humor is toned down and this tends to be a little darker. I see this as a cross between Crono Cruisade and Trigun.

The story telling could have been a bit better but it was good overall.

I would argue that they didn't really play items against each other well enough to really impact you.

An example of this (slight spoiler): Someone has a love interest in the main character and she dies. The main character's mourning is TRIGGERED by the death of the beloved friend but is POWERED by his memories of someone else... how is that for an insensitive jerk! LOL

In the end his brooding doesn't seem like a sincere act over the loss of such a close loved one.

That being said:
The action is good.
The humor is fun.
The overall artwork is just beautiful to look at.
The characters are developed well.
The music is solid.
Did I mention the art is just great?
The story concept is solid too. (An Uber vampire that feeds on vampires... fun little recursive cannibalism thing going on there.)

Would I buy this again? Yes.
Would I try to find it cheaper? Absolutely
Is it a solid show to watch? Yes

3201649,5,B000WE5I2Y,"Three cheers for beautiful anime box sets. The format of the ""Trinity Blood"" set is so nice it's almost like a modern illuminated manuscript.
But the pretty box is nothing compared to the story contained within.

The anime of ""Trinity Blood"" is a cobbling together of the stories in the light novels and the manga with an underlying plot involving the delicate transition between the conflict of the humans and the vampires to a balance of peace. It can appear to be haphazard in places, but overall the story follows a steady course to its conclusion and it has become one of my favorite anime.

The characters carry the events better than many stories I've seen. It is the changes in them that prove to be the most powerful points of the plot. Keep your eye on Esther and Alessandro, both of whom go through the most poignant transformations. My favorite scene in the entire show is towards the end when Alessandro blesses the little vampire girl's pet rabbit. You see him realizing for the first time that he has the potential to change the world, and he wants to change it for the better. There is power in simple moments like that.

And then, of course, there's Abel, who is just too weird to be believed. You find yourself completely engrossed in his character as he seems to flip back and forth from one aspect of his personality to the next in an almost schizophrenic pattern yet all the while perfectly maintaining his sympathetic humanity. I mean, watch this guy. He's so goofy and then he transforms into this nightmarish super-vampire, chopping villains down with a giant scythe (complete with a choir in the background! It's so much fun!).

Anime. Ya gotta love it. That kind of wild melodrama is all part of the awesome experience.

All the AX members have their own distinct personalities and they play off each other with archtypical perfection. Wordsworth the Bumbling Genius, Kate the Gentle and Stolid, Leon the Lovable Rogue, Hugue the Strong and Silent, Tres the Deadpan Android, Noelle the Elegant and Unrequited, Havel the Mysterious and so on and so forth, with Abel at the center as a kind of catch-all personality that they can bounce off of. It's very entertaining.

And if you like big epics with big plots, this is the story for you. It's beautiful to watch, full of elaborate backgrounds and animation. The history and mythology is complex and multi-faceted with all kinds of hidden surprises to discover. You get the impression that you've only just scratched the surface of what lies beneath. I've always had great admiration for stories like that. I never watch anime in Japanese. The subtitles are annoying. (I know, scandal to the purists) But I have nothing but good things to say about the actors chosen to voice the English version. I'd say the best performance is Troy Baker, simply because of the challenge of providing Abel with so many personality facets.

All in all, it's just a very well crafted story, unique and fascinating. Best of all (in my opinion at least) the series ends with the opening of a new chapter in the mythos. Esther is crowned and she and Alessandro stand poised to reign in a new era of peace with the Methuselah. And Abel begins his ultimate quest to rid the world of the threat of his brother Cain and the Rosen Kreutz. I like to know that the story will continue, even if I might never know what will happen. It gives a sense of satisfaction to see one door close and another open.

(This does, admittedly, make the ending feel a little rushed and cut-off, but bear in mind that Sunao Yoshida died suddenly before he was able to finish the novel series. A writer collegue of his brought the series to an end with the last book but who knows if that would've been the end if Yoshida had lived.)

I'm glad to see ""Trinity Blood"" in a box set. It will be up to each person individually whether or not the story is to their tastes, but from where I stand it's a story that no one will regret experiencing.",1196035200,66,3970,4.603960396039604

3201651,4,B000WE5I2Y,"I loved watching this, because, to me, it was amazing to see how the legends we grow up with look through the filter of a slightly different perspective. There is much that is absolutely amazing about this series -- the art, some of the characters, and the potential of this story -- and there is some that was not as good as it could have been. All in all, though, it was a highly enjoyable series.

The story is as follows (spoilers):

There are three races of humans:
- Humans (Terrans): humans...
- Methusalehs (Vampires): humans who need blood/blood substitute to survive. Vampire is an impolite term commonly employed by ""regular"" humans to denote this form of human. The Methusalehs have an extended life span and far greater power than common man. Methusalehs were created by humans experimenting on other humans.
- Crusnik: humans who survive on the blood of vampires, Crusnik live longer even than vampires, and are far more powerful. They, too, were the result of human experimentation. There were only four created -- Abel Nightroad, and his three siblings, Cain, Seth and Lilith

The main plot of the story is a struggle between Abel, and, on his side, the Church and humanity, and his brother (thought to be dead), Cain, and the clandestine Rosen Krutz Ordern. 900 years prior to the main story, as humanity broke into warring factions, the siblings chose different sides -- Lilith on the side of the Terrans, and the rest on the side of the vampires. Cain, after a life-saving operation turned him mad, murdered Lilith, and Seth and Abel in turn killed (they thought) Cain. Alas, but Cain ""undied"" a second time (not so, however, for poor Lilith who, once condemned to the grave, was condemned for all eternity). After Armageddon, and 900 years of mourning, Abel emerges, vowing to protect humans.

The Pope -- a young, whiny boy who is easily bullied by his older brother -- resides in Rome; his chief advisers are his sister, who diligently strives to keep humanity on the right course, and his brother, who -- being himself barred by illegitimate birth from direct access to papal power -- effectively wields the power of the papacy through his younger sibling. Abel works for the sister as a member of her elite branch, the AX; he often finds himself at odds with the pope's brother's Inquisitors, however.

A series of quests (many downright absurd) directs Abel to the truth of his brother's continued existence, and involvement with the Rosen Krutz Ordern. Along the way, he must confront his promise that he would never harm a human again and again (often choosing to indirectly cause thousands, perhaps millions, of deaths in order to directly maintain his vow). The same, however, is not true for vampires, whom he slaughters whenever the need arises. For these reasons, Abel's character can be very annoying at times, as he comes across as both spineless and stupid. While I get that he wants to protect humanity, as that was his dead sister's goal, the fact that vampires were a product of human experimentation - and are despised and persecuted by humans, despite the fact that they rely on a blood substitute and so [with the exception of rogue murderers] do not prey on humans  - seems to me to indicate that theirs is the more just side. But, Abel is Abel...

Abel's work brings him in contact with many people, Terran and Methusaleh, as well as his sister, Seth (the Crusnik). These characters are generally very interesting, and add much to the story (although, again, some of them are stupid...as with Wendy and Peter, and the ""Tinkerbell System"" episode). One of the interesting characters is Esther Blanchette, Abel's human love interest; another is Count Ion Fortuna, his Methusaleh rival for Esther's hand. The most interesting quests in the series come probably half way through, when Abel is in contact with the New Human Empire (the kingdom of the Methusalehs).

All in all, I give this series 4/5 stars. If not for some of the weaponry/quest-lines, which were beyond the level of absurdity acceptable even in fantasy, I would have given it 5/5...despite those, however, this was a very interesting anime series, full of complex characters and riveting episodes. Oh, and a final note...I highly recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles (if you don't speak the language)...the English dubbing was horrendous...",1296259200,,4372,4.898648648648648

I wasn't disappointed! It's alot of history mixed in with vampire lore, which draws you in and make you want to take a closer look. At first, I thought Abel Nightroad(the main character) was just a bumbling priest until I saw him turn into a crusnik. Then, I was like; okay..... I can get into this.

3201658,1,B000WE5I2Y,"I feel like I'm watching Trigun all over again and this time I hate it.

The one thing I hate about anime is that the keep recycling shows over and over again. Gundam copies from the previous series over and over again. All romance anime copy from each other. I know, I know most people who've watched enough anime already know this. I don't always have a problem with it.

For example Gundam Seed, it copies the almost exact story line from the orginal Mobile Suit Gundam which came out over 20 years ago. I gave it a 8, it gave me a couple of new things to keep me watching. That's what I want from a show that almost copies everything from a differnt anime. Now to a show that doesn't. For example Gundam Seed Destiny. It compies everything from Moble Suit Gundam and Gundam Seed, and does the same thing in every episode with nothing new to the story. It also goes on for another 50 episodes, I mean come on. This show was a complete waste of time. That's why I gave it a 1.

I just need to explain one of the reasons why I am giving Trinity Blood a 1. Trinity Blood is a rip off of Trigun. When Trigun came out in 1998 it was original anime. I've never seen anything like it before then. I gave it 5 stars, and even now it's one of the best anime I've seen, I still watch it at least once a year. Trinity Blood is just Trigun recycled eight years later. Able Nightroad is a exact copy of Vash. He acts the same and has the same past. I truly like the story of a kingdom of Vampires and humans living right beside each other. If they made a anime about that it could have been great, but instead they made it about Able aka Vash, and it turned into crap. I would recommend you skip this show and instead see what Trinity Blood copied from a classic in Trigun.",1240704000,5,1763,4.119186046511628
3201659,3,B000WE5I2Y,"Well, I've finally seen Trinity Blood and I have to agree with most of the professional critics...it's no masterpiece. It's fun though, even with its flaws: The story is full of emotional twists and turns, some of which make sense and some of which will leave you scratching your head. In either case, the depiction of these suffers from a complete lack of subtlety. This anime is just too wildly overdramatic for its own good--many of its intended touching moments just inspire eye-rolling or even laughter. Don't even get me started on the series' ending...just pure craziness. These things said, the production is pristine, with lush backgrounds and lovely character designs and if you take this anime with a pinch (or perhaps a big, heaping bowl) of salt, you'll have a good time.",1233360000,5,784,4.902255639097745

3201672,4,B000WE5I2Y,"** MINOR SPOILERS **
If you love vampires, Papal conspiracies, lots of Biblical symbolism, as well as excellent animation... then this is the series for you. Trinity Blood is a visually stunning series. The settings and character designs are lovely. The music is really quite good (not as good as a Yoko Kanno series, but what is), especially when Able changes into his Avenging Angel form. It's obvious the animators and production staff took a lot of time and TLC putting so much detailed work into this series.

Many of the characters are more than a bit stereotypical... the hero, Able - complete with a dark and mysterious past. His sort of ""love interest"" Esther - a damsel CONSTANTLY in distress - also hides an equally dark and mysterious past, but somehow it makes them more endearing... except for the fact that Esther is CONSTANTLY SCREAMING when there is the least bit of danger. Able should duct tape her mouth shut or do some kind of vampire mind-control trick to get her to take it down a few decibels.

My one regret with the series is that the rather large ""supporting cast"" was not given more time to develop. My understanding is that the creator of Trinity Blood passed away during production of the first season and someone else took over creative control in order to see that it was finished. In this series, the supporting cast is more than that. I found many of them to be at least as interesting as the two main characters. For a partial list: there's Seth - the Vampire Queen who looks looks like a 7 year old little girl, Father Tres - the android, Father Hugue - the unruly Sword Dancer, as well as the three siblings who make up the Triumvirate of the Papacy are fascinating. In my opinion, the relationships between the members of the Triumvirate: Alessandro XVIII (the actual pope - looks about age 10-12), Francesco di Medici - Alessandro's older, scheming half brother, and Caterina Sforza - Alessandro's protective older sister are one the most fascinating aspects of the entire series.

You know a series is good when it leaves you wanting to know more about characters and the overall story. This anime fits the bill. So you know where I'm coming from: Blood+, Wolf's Rain, Bleach, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Last Exile are among my personal favs.  Trinity Blood definitely ranks right up there. To wrap up... is it the best? No, but despite the semi-lame ending it's very good, and really a great way to spend a snow day.",1232236800,2,2485,4.666666666666667

This is maybe the best anime I have seen so far! The first series that got me into anime! Trinity Blood was, to put it into simple words, amazing! I don't think that the word amazing does this anime justice though! I am not a big Christian or anything but this anime is beautiful and amazing in all sorts of ways! It's too bad that this may be the very last of it although there is another set of books that continue this story! I would love to see how Abel and Ion go on and I bet they beat Cain! Vampire galore! If you love vampires, anime, blood, and you are a catholic you should fall in love with this anime! It's amazing! I'm so happy that I found this on Cartoon Network! Everyone I know who loves anime loves this anime too! I recommend this for anyone who loves anime, shojo or shonen! There is a ton of secret love, or so it seems, in this whole series. Everything in this all the emotion and drama of the storyline is amazing. I am truly honored that this is the very first real anime that I watched. When I say real anime I mean these are things that can happen in the future, not Pokemon or Digimon that I used to like, and honestly still do as long as it's the first season of either of them. This anime has an amazing storyline and everything. Again I am honored for this being my first anime that I watched that really triggered my anime need. I recommend this for anyone absolutely anyone because it is that good, it's amazing, very simply amazing!  Thank you for bringing this to me, Funimation!

 The animation is good as is the story and the only things that I can complain about are...
 #1 Abel (the Priest) is kind of Clark Kent & Barney Fife rolled into one character for many episodes, until threatened. At first you perceive it as a cover for who he is but as it goes on it seems to be his real personna.
 #2 Abel does not become his signifcant other near enough. I think some episodes not at all.
  I got out of watching ANIME for many years and that style of character has always been around...the goofy type of person. There are episodes where they get away from Abel being a goof and he takes a much more serious approach to life. Which is a good thing.
 I think it could have been better but if something were to happen to my set...I would buy it again.
 My two complaints are very minor indeed..do not get my wrong. I really enjoy this...it is dark, sets a mood,good action and introduces new characters here and there so you never get bored with everybody is the same episode after episode.
 I have seen it 3 times.. it has great replay value. So far it is one of the best series that I have. Granted I only have 80 or so complete series yet out of what I have...Elfen Lied..Black Blood Brothers..several Gundams..Death Note..Last Exile.. Hellsing..Gunslinger Girl..Full Metal Panic/Alchemist..Jyu-Oh-sei and a multitude of others. This is in the top 3.
 Not to mention that the box itself is a thing of beauty..all discs have great work on them & the disc cases are very well done. I did not like the fact that they have 2 discs in each case. They put them one on top of the other instead of something like a thin pack where they will out one on each side of the case.
 Oh....also when I put in discs 3 & 4..they were not in surround sound. Yet if you go into Audio put it on Surround 5.1..hit ""Enter"" subtitles on or off..""Enter"" it puts you back to the main menu and everything played fine from there.

8222880,5,B000WE5I2Y,"I simply wish to indicate my FULL agreement of the most popular comment on this item, left by E. Burt ""Lady Miriam"". My extra 2 cents... It is without a doubt one of my top 10 favorite anime series of ALL-TIME. I've honestly seen MANY hundreds of different anime ""series"" through completion, and am so happy still to have ever come across this particular set. I've now seen it three times, and have thoroughly enjoyed it immensely ALL THREE TIMES. This particular item ""set"" includes the best of the best when it comes to collector memorabilia. Beautifully drawn characters, gorgeous colors and settings, and let us not forget, absolutely AMAZING and VERY memorable music throughout the complete series. (I have the entire soundtrack on both my PC and my MP3 player... it's really just that darn good.) All in all, you can NOT go wrong with this purchase in my opinion. Any true anime fan will be truly happy to have this wonderful set sitting on their shelf. :) Enjoy!",1330992000,7,969,4.705882352941177
8222881,4,B000WE5I2Y,"Casing and Extras:
Dvd's come in pairs of 2 embroidered artwork that has art on back and front
The box itself has embroidered art and fold open like a book case (top flap flips open like a chest)
Has background artwork and history of the anime and biblical history as well
Extras provide further history knowledge of the Roman Empire as well some Biblical information

Series:
Great story line but seems as though the series was cut short and some of the episodes don't quite flow together with another; meaning that they could stand alone when not part of the mini series.  Other than that, the animation and story provides a different view the church verses vampires and the cg is well blened in something funimation is known for.

Overall, this anime is worth the buy, especially if you liked blood+ and Hellsing.",1309996800,,816,4.6923076923076925
