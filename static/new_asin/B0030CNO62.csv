I highly reccomend this to anyone that is really interested in the blues history. My mother in law watched it with me, she had never really listened to the blues or thought much about it. She was really impressed with the music and blues musicians. She talked about what a rough life they had and how much she was impressed with their music. It was good to get her take on the life and times of the blues musicians. It was a fresh take from someone not familiar with the life and times in which they lived. We watched more blues videos the next couple of nights.",1351468800,9,687,4.134328358208955

4044009,5,B0030CNO62,"If you are a Blues lover you know about Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress. This famous film, made for American PBS TV in 1979 and put to air in 1980 is a true classic of rare blues performances and an insight into the value of ethnomusicology. The documentary is a journey into the Delta at a very interesting time, the Blues ""Boom"" had died out and was about to be rekindled with people like SRV in the early 1980s. This documentary makes a great and pertinent statment about the blues at the time. The DVD also includes a two hour set of compelling, original, raw and ""real deal"" performances which would be worth buying for themselves.

Of these performances, which are all great, two especially shine. RL Burnside, from the Northern Mississippi Hill Country performs an early version of ""Jumper on the Line"", a track he made famous in the early 1990s film version of Robert Palmer's ""Deep Blues"" and this version is earthier and really a classic. It was recorded on September 2, 1978 at his home. The second tune ""Blues"" also shows Burnside's great blues interpretative ability of the classic Delta style. Burnside knew and played with Mississippi Fred McDowell who, like Burnside, were missed when the Lomax entourage first came through Mississippi in the 1940s. They basically fell between the cracks during the first forays into recording and preserving this music. After the ""Deep Blues"" exposure Burnside went on to late fame with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and then as a solo artist. The tune ""Jumper on the Line"" was also good enough to be the lead tune in the Rough Guide's ""Delta Blues"" compilation. You will play this one over and over.

We who have loved and played blues all of our lives still look out for the best and rarest Blues performances recorded to become available, if they in fact exist. In this set there is one which is worth three times the DVD price. It is the Sam Chatmon set. Fortunately we just got this recording too, Chatmon died a bit over four years later in February 1983. First of all Chatmon played with Charlie Patton who was probably his uncle. He then became a member of the Mississippi Shieks and this is the only film available of any of these guys. They were very influential in the development of the Blues, especially Blues Bands.

Sam Chatmon also did the first version of ""Crosscut Saw"", before Tommy McClennan and Albert King. In this set he sings ""Corina"" which became the great Joe Turner hit and Blues standard. However, the MAIN tune on the whole DVD is ""Sitting On Top Of The World"". This tune became famous again with Howlin Wolf and then of course Cream in the 1960s. He helped to write this tune with other Shiek members Walter Vinson and brother Lonnie Chatmon (even though he doesn't get credit) and it was group's first hit in 1930 on Okeh Records. The Shieks recorded over 80 sides. This is the only film of any of the members (there is even a small section of footage on the Memphis Jug Band!). In addition to all this an early performance of Otha Turner's Fife and Drum Band is also included.

This is a monumental re-release with enhanced picture quality and good sound. It has a lot (three hours) of extras including a ""Making Of"" segment, ""Editing the Film"", ""Levee Camp Interview"" and, of course, the great performances. This will be a great addition to your Blues library.",1279065600,39,3353,4.63973063973064

This is essential viewing and presented beautifully.  Don't hesitate!  Pick this one up now!!",1264464000,19,346,5.125

8385748,5,B0030CNO62,"Alan Lomax's film, ""The Land Where the Blues Began,"" was part of his excellent PBS series ""American Patchwork,"" focusing on different aspects of American folk song and jazz. This particular film, containing music by and interviews with several Delta blues musicians, is a deeply felt and sympathetic documents of the conditions under which many of these blues players lived and which inspired their music. It's a historical and sociological as well as a musical exploration, and probably the best film I know about the blues.

That said, I feel that for most collectors an earlier DVD, part of a five-DVD series that preserves the entire ""American Patchwork"" may be sufficient. While this new version contains a couple of hours of extra blues footage, some of it excellent, I'm not sure how much of this was done by Lomax. I was also disappointed that this version comes only in a thin cardboard sleeve, hard to store with other DVD's, and there are absolutely no notes or documentation.",1465948800,2,987,4.945783132530121

8385751,4,B0030CNO62,"A simple presentation of hard times, long hours of day labor on the farms and cotton plantations with poor pay, like 40 to 50 cents per hour. It demonstrates how they attuned their hard labor by sinking basic blues to lighten their efforts and reflect their despair and hard times. Some left these farms and their families to work on the riverboats, railways and levees to make higher wages. In those times, they played course instruments
like a string nailed strong on a porch wall to strike a music sound along with short and basic singing. Their rhythm sounds were developed from the Civil Wars days that featured fife and drums and carried forth thru generations until they used a guitar type instrument. Doesn't present a lot of jazzy
type music but just short versions pf simple songs. Therefore, I gave it a 4 rating. However, there is an addendum where you can hear and see each
song performed separately on its own.",1432598400,,924,4.674846625766871
