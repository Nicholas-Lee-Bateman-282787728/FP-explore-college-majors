2713641,4,B000LSAIZ8,"""That's an obelisk!"" ""We have to find those dragon kites!"" ""The big red balloon can't fly high enough to get over Coit Tower!"" The four ""Little Einsteins"" kids travel to Egypt, China and San Francisco on this DVD, which groups together two episodes of the popular Disney Channel preschooler series with a third episode never shown on television. As always, the episodes include serious works of art and classical music.

In ""The Legend of the Golden Pyramid,"" the kids -- Annie, June, Leo and Quincy -- take off to Egypt, where they travel through the desert, down the Nile and to the Sphinx. They eventually find a pyramid that contains a golden harp, where they have a dance party with the ancient hieroglyphics inside. The featured music is ""Hungarian Dance No. 5"" by Johannes Brahms.

""The Dragon Kite"" sends the curious crew to China, where they help track down friends of a Little Dragon Kite and then join the big Dragon Kite Parade. This show introduces little paste-eaters to paintings by Zhou Shen, Cai Jia, Zhang Lu and Chou Ying as well as the music of Edvard Grieg (""Peer Gynt, Suite No. 1: In the Hall of the Mountain King"").

The new episode, ""Annie and the Little Toy Plane"" is set in San Francisco. As the gang, and the plane, tries to rescue a helicopter, viewers learn about Coit Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge. It's got Keith Haring's ""Untitled, 1988"" and Mozart's ""Symphony No. 40.""

There's also a bonus feature, ""Where's Froggy's Family?"" This one is snooze city for parents, but kids may like it. Using his or her television remote like a video-game controller, a viewer joins Leo for a globe-trotting (yet snail-paced) interactive journey that helps a frog return to his home.

If you're new to the ""Little Einsteins"" series, think of it as the best intentions of National Geographic, Sesame Street and the National Endowment for the Arts combined with an animation budget of, oh, maybe a dollar.

Still, what's not to like? The four kids are cute (their heads are as big as their bodies), all the messages are positive, the art and music are handled just right for a preschool mind, and the shows never talk down to kids.",1174348800,36,2149,4.717333333333333
2713642,5,B000LSAIZ8,We were in IHOP and my three yr old grandson was humming the theme song from one of the Little Einsteins' movies.  There was an older couple sitting across from us and I noticed the lady put her arm on her husband and motioned to Darius.  They sat listening to him sing and smiled and nodded.  They left before us and when I asked the waitress for the check she told me the couple had paid it for us.  It was almost $40.00.  All because they were impressed with my grandson's humming and we owe it to the movies.  They are awesome!  Now if only there were action figures and a rocket.,1174176000,,584,4.160714285714286
2713643,5,B000LSAIZ8,"We have acquired all of the Little Einsteins DVDs over the past 1 1/2 years.  My girls are ages 7, 5 and 3.  I was never a fan of Baby Einstein videos, but these actually teach meaningful bits of information they can hang facts onto for later learning experiences.  The classical music is inspiring, the geography lessons impactful and they love to dance and sing along with the characters.  These are by far one of my favorite DVDs that my children all enjoy and are learning from.  Why can't more programming be educational like these?",1174003200,,537,4.610526315789474
2713644,4,B000LSAIZ8,"This LE video (The Legend of the Golden Pyramid) entertains my three year old daughter. She hears the same classical music compositions on the radio and correctly associates them with those on the DVD.

2713645,2,B000LSAIZ8,"By and for people who want their kids to grow up in EXACTLY the same world they grew up in.

There are four kids in this show, two girls and two boys.

The two girls are a singer (Caucasian/white) and a dancer (possibly Asian).  The African-American/black boy is a multi-instrumentalist.  The Caucasian/white boy is a conductor.

The 19th century Europe was the height of Human Civilization, with a few exceptions like the ancient Egypt and Hokusai from Edo-period Japan.",1173571200,3,471,4.9113924050632916

2713719,5,B000LSAIZ8,"These Little Einstein dvd's are a great buy!

My son loves classical music, and yours will too as they hone in on their musical appreciation skills with the Little Einsteins. History, Art, Science- it's all there.

Bonus: This dvd has something called Disneys ""FastPlay"". That means you don't have to wait through annoying trailers to hit play after the title screen comes up. It will automatically play.... ON REPEAT. This helps since he wants to watch it over and over.

THE BEST PART: This show will not annoy Mom or Dad! It's mellow, and mellows out my busy toddler who usually goes nuts when watching annoying characters like Elmo. He really learns a lot watching these!",1453075200,,675,4.801724137931035
2713720,3,B000LSAIZ8,"There's not much to add to what this product is - the Little Einsteins go to adventures in Egypt and China. It's good, fun, and educational.

The thing about this particular DVD, though, is that it's advertised (on the box, even) as having Spanish and French audio tracks. However, only episodes one and two have those tracks. The third episode is available in English only. I bought this DVD specifically for the Spanish audio track, so this was disappointing - I basically got 2/3 of what I paid for. Anyhow, this may not be a deal breaker for you, but just wanted to include it in my review so that others are aware of it.",1451088000,,625,4.434782608695652

2713808,2,B000LSAIZ8,"This DVD has 3 episodes of little Einstein and a Bonus Game. The episodes are quite educational about different cultures (however some reviewers say they've already been on Cable TV). I found them to be very helpfull for my 3.5 yo son. He now knows about hierogliphs, the sphinx, the pyramids...plus alot of Vocabulary as well. Which is quite amazing at this age.
However, I rated the DVD with 2 stars only, because I bought this DVD as the ONLY DVD in the little Einsteins collection with French soundtrack (my kid doesn't understand or speak English yet). However, 1 of the 3 episodes is with English soundtrack only. They have that written as a subtitle at the start of the episode... They should have written it in the product description for us to know before buying.
Also, the Bonus game does not work, it puts the DVD and the laptop on hang.
Having said that, I wish that more DVDs of the collection had French soundtracks (for all episodes).
Bottom Line, recommended Only If you are not interested in other language soundtracks and your kids haven't got the chance to watch the Little Einstein episodes on Cable TV.",1211414400,3,1123,4.6767676767676765

Just before he turned three, he started to correctly tell me what instruments he heard on the radio (starting with a xzylophone, of all things).  I absolutely can't take any credit for him knowing these instruments.  The credit all goes to the Little Einsteins.  I am thrilled that time spent watching these shows has been beneficial to him.

My husband told me that they watch TV together in bed on Saturday morning while I am at the gym, and that she seemed mesmerized. I went out and bought the DVD's and would play them for her while she was in her swimg. Sure enough, at about 3 months she was laughing at the characters!

Another amazing program by a fantastic company. My friends tease me that I listen to the videos even when Kate is not in the car!

She has all the Little Eistein movies except for the one that has the ones from the tv show. She watches them almost everyday and loves when she gets a new one. These are great movies for little kids to learn. She has be larger vocabulary then most 2 yr olds.
