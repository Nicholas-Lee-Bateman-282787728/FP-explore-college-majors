860417,5,630438954X,"This is one of those old classic fovourites that, like Casablanca, is impossible to repeat. The acting, directing and photography is perfect (although you must make allowances for the age of the film - it's not crystal clear like a new movie would be).  It's one of those artistic gems. It has an indefinable charm which makes it absorbing viewing.
I hope some day  an outfit like 'The Criterion Collection' will do it the honor of a complete revitalization.",1259712000,4,458,4.784810126582278
860418,5,630438954X,"The picture is outstanding, especially if you like piano music.

However this is in PAL(DVD-9) format.  Most US DVD players will not work with this format.  A conversion house charged $29.95 (plus tax) to convert it to NTSC-Blue Ray format.",1254700800,3,240,4.95
860419,5,630438954X,"This is a beautiful story about a gifted pianist dominated by an apparently ruthless uncle. He forces her to stay focused on her talent and molds her into a great concert pianist. She is distracted by shallow love affairs but in the end cannot deny her love of playing and the love of her 'ruthless' uncle. The clash between her genius, her lovers and her uncle caused psychological probems which are sorted out by a pschologist. The story unfolds on his couch as he penetrates the 'seventh veil' to cure the cause of her troubles. What makes the film a classic is the brilliant acting of Ann Todd and James Mason. This film could never be remade because it is impossible to improve on perfection. It's in black and white and of VHS quality. I can't understand why Criterion hasn't produced a refurbished DVD version. I'm sure some day they, or someone else, will. In the mean time the VHS version is a must for your classical library.",1216339200,13,935,4.571428571428571
860420,4,630438954X,"I loved watching The Seventh Veil. I think it's one of James Mason's best roles and his chemistry with Ann Todd is beautiful to witness. The story is a simple one( orphan goes to live with with handsome and moody relative, they fall in love). The music is superb and the ending is what we would have expected, but it was very enjoyable. James Mason was a very good actor and deserved to be a bigger star. His was one of the best voices of any actor of his generation. The Seventh Veil passes the test of time.",1107129600,17,509,4.204081632653061
860421,5,630438954X,"I love this movie. I fell in love with in when I saw it the first and was hooked ever since to James Mason. I didn't know that Todd and Mason were having an affair but no matter, they certainly made a good couple. It astounds me how Todd acted so well to her character and how Mason protrays the deep love that he had for her in his way of rejecting her time and time again. How he slams his cane over her hands as she dares to leave him for someone else. In the end though, I kinda felt that she should have ended up with the doctor but I know that she and Mason were meant to be together. Mason has always fascinated me as an actor that never got his true claim. When he played in Lolita, he did very well though I was surprised that he would do a movie like that. But the Seventh Veil was very good and I recommend it to everyone who likes in the old classics that the modern stuff would never obtain.",1078963200,11,904,3.9453551912568305
860422,4,630438954X,"This is a fascinating and intense movie, a classic of its genre and one which is teeming with repressed sexuality. The two lead performers, James Mason and Ann Todd, were romantically involved throughout the making of this film and had an affair in real life (as Todd later admitted). Their chemistry is quite palpable, though not in the same way as Tracy and Hepburn; the entire movie is an exercise is repression, caution and masked motions. In fact, with a few exceptions, neither star even touches one another throughout the movie, but there is more overt sex here than in many more graphic films. One must simply strain harder to discern it.
Mason is beautifully wicked here, his evil nature and sadism are extremely attractive to watch. Ann Todd is a repressed and frightened pianist who suffers to horror of having Mason slam his cane down upon her hands while she scales the keyboard. Delicious! This scene, above any other, catapulted James Mason to the forefront of British cinema stars. Watch the scene where a white kitty is curled on his lap as he dourly pets it and stares daggers as Todd in the background. You can cut the psychological melodrama here with a thick butter knife.
This isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you appreciate a beautiful man in Mason, a terrified lamb of a starlet like Ann Todd, and an adroit and mature screenplay, then watch ""The Seventh Veil."" It has worn very well in the ensuing decades and still makes for gripping viewing.",1058227200,31,1471,4.727626459143969
860423,5,630438954X,"A young James Mason molds a distant relative into a world-class pianist (Ann Todd).  The film begins in the present with Francesca (Ann Todd) being hypnotized by a psychiatrist to probe her fear of injury to her hands.  Through flashbacks the story of an orphaned young girl and a controlling guardian is told amid beautiful piano music.  I loved the focus of Beethoven's Adagio from the Pathetique as well as the ever popular Rachmaninoff 2nd piano concerto.  The title, ""The Seventh Veil"" refers to each level of disclosure a person reveals about themselves.  The psychiatrist must reveal the last and most deep...""The Seventh Veil"".  Superb acting and wonderful music make this film at the top of my list of classics.  Ann Todd is especially withdrawn and emotionless dealing with her guardian, James Mason.  James Mason is quite handsome and sometimes infuriating.  Turn off your phone and curl up with this magnetic movie, you won't be disappointed!!

 As a pianist, I was very impressed with how well Ann Todd pantomimes playing and how the "" real"" pianist's hands were juxtaposed into the shots.
Probably, the best job of this process that I've ever seen. Nothing is more irksome than when the playing looks obviously fake! Some of the most egregious examples: Tyrone Power in The Eddy Duchin Story; Cornel Wilde in A Song To Remember; Nyree Dawn Porter in 60's version of The Forsyte Saga.

The film is a fascinating psychological study, which may sound dull, but there's a constant undercurrent of tension and struggle throughout.  The one thing that saves the film is the beautiful classical music, which gives the main character's life a purpose she otherwise wouldn't have found.  She's a teenager when the film starts and slowly she grows into adulthood, focusing on her work, driven by her guardian to value her gift above all things.  Although James Mason's character seems cold and unkind, in the end it becomes clear that he has given her life meaning.  Over time her looks might fade, but her talents would enrich her life and the lives of those around her.  Finally she comes to appreciate that--and him.",1409356800,,886,4.952702702702703

860685,4,630438954X,"Ohhhhh what we could make of James Mason's performance by today's standards!  I shudder to think of it really but let's not go there....let us go back to 1946, when this film was released.  For it's time it was a dark, yet highly entertaining and popular, well received film!  The casting of Ann Todd as Francesca Cunningham and James Mason, as Nicholas in the all important roles make it a must see for fans. She is the orphaned and innocent young girl who lives her life through and loves the piano and he, the embattled, embittered cripple of a man who is a distant cousin thrice removed who becomes her guardian. Hers was not at all a wonderful existence under his female despising, confirmed bachelor's thumb and yet, it is he that molds her into the world renowned concert pianist she becomes.  His tutelage borders on the cruel and yet, he has a saving grace. Through the years of training and giving his life to her success we see a love, of sorts, develop. As Francesca comes of age she discovers, much to her surprise, she is an attractive young woman.  An older fellow student and already established musician falls in love with her and she with him.  Nicholas soon sees to it that nothing will come between his vision of her true place in life and he takes her away from him, escaping to Europe for further instruction and concert success.  Through the years, however, another love finds her and she is set to elope with him when an automobile accident befalls them.  Francesca has had her hands burned in the wreck and it is her hands she has been so frightened of injuring ever since they were caned when she was a girl in boarding school for a small infraction of the rules and who could not, then, compete in an important competition at school for a musical scholarship!  Francesca is so distraught and worried for her hands she attempts suicide and it is from this failed attempt we first meet her psychiatrist, Dr. Larsen, who is very amply played by the wonderful actor, Herbert Lom, Since her attempt she has become semi-comatose and he cannot reach her.  He wishes to bring her back to reality through hypnosis but must first elicit the consent of Nicholas, her only known relation and mentor. What Dr. Larsen discovers through this hypnosis brings the three men in her life back together under the same roof...for this is from where her underlying problem actually stems. Francesca must not only find her hands are indeed intact and can still play but she also, against all odds, must discover who it is she truly loves and wishes to be together with for her lifetime. It is here, dear reader, that I will leave you to discover, who it is to be...for this is a must see film of Academy Award proportions!",1401148800,8,2726,4.579055441478439

Wonderful performances by Ann Todd and James Mason.  Interesting story about early psychoanalysis.  Am very glad that I got to see it again! :),1351987200,14,295,4.290909090909091

7869720,1,630438954X,"Buyer beware! This disc purports to be for ""All"" regions, but when I tried to play it, my screen displayed this message: "" Playback prohibited by area limitations.""  The seller allowed me to return it for a refund, so I'm not out of pocket, but what a disappointment!  I dimly recall this film from my high school days, and was excited when it appeared that a dvd was finally available that would play on US equipment.  But it was not to be.  If I want another look at James Mason's sadistic piano instruction methods, I may have to spring for an all-region player.",1496102400,,565,4.456310679611651

7869727,4,630438954X,"Would have loved it except for the ending in which an amazing women reverts to choosing her abuser.  That part really sucked altho that mentality of the era totally informs and supports the dysfunctional idea that people should love their abusers, no matter what destruction/damage the abusers cause.",1471996800,,300,5.25

7869729,5,630438954X,"I wish they made films like this today.  Since many others have described the story here I will refrain from adding except to say that it is very  incredibly acted and actually has an ending, unlike so many dramas of today.  See it.
