8459197,3,B005645HP8,"For anyone who has not seen the original Burnt by the Sun, Nikita Mikhalkovs Oscar-winning movie made in 1994, The Citadel would be just a confusing war drama with a lot of characters and flashbacks. The facts is, Burnt by the sun 2 - The Citadel (Utomlyonnye solntsem 2  Citadelis) is the SECOND sequel to the original, the first sequel being Burnt by the sun 2  Exodus.

The Citadel begins with a combat sequence where Russian soldiers at the frontline, all tired, are ordered by a drunken officer to assault a German stronghold (The Citadel). Just before the reckless attack begins, an officer Mitya (Oleg Menshikov) arrives, looking for Kotov (Mikhalkov), former revolution hero. Kotov attempts to run away, but to where? And why does Mitya want him?

You may think Citadel is a war movie, but there are not many combat scenes. It is more like a drama about Kotov and his family, friends and enemies. In Citadel we meet again Kotov and Mitya, as well as Kotovs daughter Nadia and most of the characters from the original. Its good to meet them even though the prolonged mid-section would be tedious if you have not seen the original.

As to the ending (no spoilers), or the result of the siege of the Citadel, all I can say is that it is very weird. The result left me head-scratching. Is this some kind of joke? Or allegory? Am I missing something? I am still trying to figure out the best way to describe what happens to the Citadel and two main characters in the final fifteen minutes, but still don't know what to say.

Those who have seen and enjoyed (like me) the original Burnt by the Sun might not like The Citadel. I do not think the two-part sequel is a terrible mess. It is overlong, to be sure, but it has a few nice bits here and there. Having seen what happened to the characters at the end of Burnt by the Sun, however, I do not think we really need a sequel.",1391731200,,1878,4.428985507246376
8459198,4,B005645HP8,"Citadel is being billed as `Burnt by the Sun 2' but is actually the final part in Nikita Mikhalkov's trilogy that started with the original Oscar winning `Burnt by the sun' way back in 1994. Then it returned with `Exodus - Burnt by the Sun 2' (2010) yes it is called number two too and to be honest it was a right load of plop so describing that one as a `number two' is the most accurate. But still irritating numerology aside this one is actually miles better - still not as good as the first one but follow ups rarely are.

This time we see Mikhalkov playing the beleaguered Commander Kotov who has been imprisoned, fallen from grace and is now in a penal battalion being forced to take a German stronghold called The Citadel in what is a suicide charge. Stalin's Order 227 `Not a step back' is used to great effect and the use of anti retreat units which all actually happened. Kotov's daughter who famously got out her breasts in the last one for a dying soldiers last wish, has returned and this time, thankfully, manages to keep her kit on. She has lost her voice though due to trauma, and I am guessing that was a result of the terrible script from the last film.

She is a nurse and a pioneer and still gets into numerous scrapes but everything is believable this time. We have more or less the same actors as before and there are flash backs to part 1and this time Kotov, as part of his rehabilitation, gets to meet Stalin. This is played with delicious malevolence by Maksim Sukhanov who played him in the last one too. He also finally makes it home but then finds he has to fight to get back his good name and reputation which ultimately leads back to the Citadel of the title.

There is some CGI of the planes etc and some good action scenes but this is more thoughtful and reflective similar to the original and has been heavily edited for the foreign market as in Russia this is to be a TV mini series, it still runs to 150 minutes though. It is in Russian with good sub titles and is generally well acted, directed and good production values.  This production does stand up in its own right and is a better tribute to Mikhalkov's abilities and I think it is a fine end to the story so am going for 4 stars but I am feeling generous today.",1373932800,3,2254,4.284037558685446
8459199,5,B005645HP8,"You must see all the movies to ""Burnt by the Sun"" to fully appreciate this final story of a great WWII saga. A point of view most Americans have never seen, but you will still root for the underdog. A very moving, and long, presentation. Watch them all.",1369267200,,253,4.291666666666667
8459200,5,B005645HP8,"Be sure to see ""urnt by the Sun,"" first, then ""Burnt by the Sun 2""  before attempting to understand ""Citadel."" By the middle of the first movie you will have fallen in love with Col. Kotov, Soviet hero,  as Stalin rises to power before the purges.  You will not be bothered by the subtitles because all three movies are very powerful with their story and their characters.  The ""Citadel"" story is what you have been looking for since the ending of the first movie and all three movies--the entire story--will stay in your memory and in your heart  I have played them several times and it will not be the last--more for the enjoyment of the strong characters who battle unbelievable hardship and thus motivate me.  You won't be disappointed, but see the movies in order.",1354665600,2,769,4.617647058823529
