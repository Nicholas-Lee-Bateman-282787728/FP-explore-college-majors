8268782,5,B001881ANO,"This is one of the most fun workouts I have in my huge collection of VHS and DVDs. I have owned this VHS for 10 years, and it's a go-to when I am feeling fit. In other words, I don't start this one after months of inactivity. But, after I've begun a workout program (yes, a classic yo-yo work-out-er!), and I am in shape, I go to this because it is super fun, very UNIQUE, and effective--you will sweat your butt off, and have some seriously sore legs a day later. This is a lot of fun, and even though you are working HARD, it is also relaxing. It's a really cool workout, and I wish I could purchase it as a DVD.",1290124800,,614,4.0
