3959222,5,B002NBJA7S,"I can't get enough of Lois, she is awesome!  Loved both of her books and now love this DVD.  She is so inspiring!  She inspired me to get my first motorbike and now she is inspiring me to take my first real motorbike trip!  This DVD is great!",1254182400,,242,3.9791666666666665
3959223,4,B002NBJA7S,"Get your boots and helmet on. This DVD is an absolute inspiration. It is well put together, moves along at a good pace, and is full of very useful information such as how to maintain yourself and your vehicle, what to ride and what you are likely to expect on the road. It is long, so give yourself time or arrange a few sittings for it but I for one will be be going back and looking at again and again.
Importantly it is not just a dry informative watch. This is fun and you will find yourself chuckling as you watch these women riding their bikes around the world whilst dealing with the shortage of knickers and tampons.  What they don't lack is spirit and humour.
I am getting a lot out of this DVD and am heading off for a ride as soon as I finish typing this. As for a longer trip, the DVD makes it clear that it not only CAN be done, but that it is definitely worth doing. In these financially strapped times it is always good to hear of people getting out and doing!",1251849600,,975,4.104712041884817

8374939,4,B002NBJA7S,"the product is very good quality, fine finishes and carefully packed. The product description is what you get, just missing the sub titles .......",1373587200,,146,5.125
8374940,5,B002NBJA7S,"I've read Lois Pryce's book ""Lois on the Loose,"" and having her narrate this episode is fitting. She's inspirational, as are the other women in the video. They don't under state the difficulties involved in world travel by motorcycle, but they show it's possible. I probably won't do many of the things they showed, such as change a bike tire, but I do know I can travel across the US on my motorcycle, and have done so. I've been further inspired to learn more, such as how to pick up my 750-lb bike, which I now know I can do! As I ride alone on lonely roads, this is a handy skill to have. The women talk about practicalities such as packing, feminine hygiene on the road, following your instincts in dicey situations, and many more topics. If you are a woman who rides at all-cross country, dirt, racing, on the back, or however-this is a great video for you!",1368230400,,863,4.4
8374941,5,B002NBJA7S,"Susan and Grant are simply amazing! I'm so thankful they decided to share all their knowledge and experiences about motorbike travels. By watching these DVDs you really get the idea of what the title already expresses so well: an achievable dream! I cannot stop watching them over and over ...
Hope to see you guys some day, some where in the world.
Have a nice trip,

8374942,5,B002NBJA7S,"very informative and entertaining,  Would recommend this to anyone contemplating long rides whether man or woman. Happy to have this as part of my video collection.  Bought this video for my wife who found it inspirational and admires the women is this video.  We've done a number of trips on our bikes together and found this video to affirm our love of motorcycle riding.",1363737600,,373,4.796875
8374943,5,B002NBJA7S,Bought this when I got back on my motorcycle after a lifetime away from riding. I was nervous and trying to find something to boost my courage. This was great for that!!!,1336867200,,170,4.34375
8374944,5,B002NBJA7S,"Bought this my wife, who has been riding for years and now rides a R1200GS of her own. Didn't have too high expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. We both enjoyed the humor and the insights offered by these remarkable women. The stories of their adventures are told in a self deprecating and entertaining style that makes them great fun to watch and listen to. The photographs and anecdotes make the whole DVD well worth the (cheap) price of admission. Now I'm scheming to buy the entire series.",1332633600,,504,4.738636363636363
8374945,5,B002NBJA7S,"I bought this DVD for my wife as a mother's day present! (she loves adventure). Initially I must admit, she was not all that excited about the gift! But after watching it for the third time she just could not get enough of it, each time picking up something new (I think that happens because you get a bit dreamy watching it, thinking of how to plan your next adventure or how to prepare yourself and your bike!) its great fun watching her enjoy it so much, and for a 36 year veteran to motorcycling, I'm getting a kick out of it too.
This is a down to earth DVD: no over glorified macho attitudes, just straight up talk about the thrill of the adventure experience, this along with Long Way Round "" A must have""",1305244800,,712,4.242647058823529
8374946,5,B002NBJA7S,"I have also read both of Lois' books and knew they are great but I wasn't sure a video about women riding would be very interesting I am glad to say that the DVD Ladies on the Loose is great!

The video gives great insight into why, how, when, where, and who these ladies are that ride motorcycles on short and long trips. The information is great and the editing and format of the video is excellent. Not boring or repetitive, it gives the good, bad, and ugly of taking a trip on a bike. It gives credit to the two women who rode through Africa by themselves.. in 1912 (or so) as well as the many since then who have ridden amazing trips including around the world just because they wanted to. No visions of fame, glory, or financial gain.

I recently suffered through watching the ""Long (and boring) Way Round"" with Ewan McGreggor (sp?) and Ladies on the Loose is so far above that mess of a show that it is in a class of its own. Ladies on the Loose doesn't downplay the potential of danger nor does it present the riders as adrenalin junkies risking death each day.

My wife wanted me to buy her a bike to ride after reading the book ""Lois On The Loose"" even though she hasn't ridden in 25 years. She is having fun riding and after watching Ladies on the Loose she is even talking about joining me on multi-day riding adventure.

I highly recommend ""Ladies on the Loose"" for all women riders, women wondering about riding, men who want to understand women riders better, men who wish their ladies would want to go somewhere on a bike with them, and basically everyone else too.

Now I want to get the other videos in the series.

I will say that I was disappointed there is not a ""captions"" option as I am hard of hearing and the accents of some of the people made it hard to understand what they were saying. On the plus side, that gives me a great reason to watch it over and over. I always have the captions on when I watch anything, so it may not be a concern for you.

We give ""Ladies on the Loose"" 2 thumbs up!",1304294400,,2020,4.217616580310881
