8144983,5,B000ICLRFC,Its a good set. Its hard to find decent content on the very first civilizations. Everything seems to start with Ancient Greece. I used this to introduce the first cities and the change from hunter gatherer to agriculture to my art history course.,1473206400,,246,4.744186046511628
8144984,4,B000ICLRFC,Originally done for UK audiences in 2001 (according to IMDB). Maybe it finally made it to America in 2006. First beliefs is my favorite.,1465084800,,136,4.708333333333333
8144985,2,B000ICLRFC,"Secrets of Ancient Empires collection is a disappointing 5 DVD-set compared to say, Secrets of Archeology.  Secrets of Archeology, a six-DVD set, introduces viewers to twenty-seven amazing archeological sites spread over Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.

Secrets of Ancient Empires tries to cover too much ground in a very short time.  The running time of each DVD is just 50 minutes.  The series successively covers the first civilizations, cities, merchants, armies, and beliefs.  The computer-generated imagery used is repetitive and does not seem to be state-of-the-art.  Some DVDs like The First Cities feature some lousy acting that makes watching it a chore.

To summarize, this DVD-set can best be forgotten due to its superficial treatment of key subjects that should allow viewers to better understand what they owe to the ancient empires.",1177286400,15,856,5.390977443609023
