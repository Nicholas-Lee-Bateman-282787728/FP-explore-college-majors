2245120,3,B0007V1BOG,"I got the water pilates that came with a CD also and use it all the time.  I wanted to do the yoga and the Tai Chi, but uh, no CD, bummer!  Need to figure out a solution.  A dvd does me no good at the pool folks!",1374451200,,212,3.375
2245121,4,B0007V1BOG,"While the interpretation of some forms, such as parting wild horse's mane were different than how I practice 24-form yang style, they work well in the water -----adding leg movement. I will use some of these forms in my hydro yo chi class, which combines yoga and tai chi.",1364947200,,272,4.571428571428571
2245122,3,B0007V1BOG,"The DVD itself was done in a lovely fashion and I had loved the idea of being able to learn Tai Chi in my pool. However, it might have been better to purchase a beginners version first, then use this as a daily regime. I say this because the instructor's pace was too fast for someone just learning and I spent more time reversing the DVD and watching the instructions once again than I did actually doing Tai Chi.",1358035200,,414,4.253164556962025
2245123,3,B0007V1BOG,"The following is just a personal opinion and has nothing to do with a professionals point of view.
The quality of the underwater part is not the best I have ever seen.(That is the technical part).
 Somehow I have missed the essence of Tai Chi the way is done originally. (the moments of stillness and the calmness while the exercises are performed. - Or Maybe I am just too European.....
 It plays good on my Mac but there is a difficulty to deal with a PC - microsoft software....",1303084800,,481,4.393258426966292
2245124,5,B0007V1BOG,"I found this DVD an excellent guide for instructing students the benefits of aqua Tai Chi.  As a student of three yers learning Chen style Tai Chi I find the movements are different.  However, as with all Tai Chi, the health benefits are limitless.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone fortunate enough to have the use of a heated pool.",1235347200,2,338,4.508196721311475
2245125,4,B0007V1BOG,Overall the exercises are good and well explained. The underwater photography is not very clear. In many exercises it is a bit hazy.,1225584000,,132,4.782608695652174
8052103,5,B0007V1BOG,Great for water exercise,1456099200,,24,5.25
8052104,4,B0007V1BOG,"I wanted to use my pool for something more than just floating around in and bought this dvd (and a couple others) to start a workout program.  I have good intentions and plan on starting soon.  I did review the program and found the product a little ""fuzzy"" and there were sections that I couldn't see what the legs were doing all the time, but there isn't a lot of pool workout videos available so you pick from what is available.",1446940800,,431,4.308641975308642
8052105,2,B0007V1BOG,I also love Carol's water Pilates dvd with cd.  I would love this tai chi but can't use it without a cd for the water. how did they think this would work?,1444521600,,154,3.8125
8052106,2,B0007V1BOG,It's OK but not what I was really looking for.h,1426204800,,47,3.8
8052107,5,B0007V1BOG,"I have begun Water Tai Chi to compliment other forms of exercise.  Tai Chi is so different from other forms of exercise we normally do.  Moving to water from land to do structured movement that includes balance and practicing ease and effort was difficult to get use to at first.  Now, its something I look forward to doing.  In the video Ms Argo provides visuals on land, where it is much easier to watch exact body movement, and then moves into the water, where the Tai Chi will be practiced.  Within a few sessions you find that the DVD has provided you with an easy to understand exercise program in water that is a great compliment to land based exercises.",1425686400,,661,4.475
8052108,5,B0007V1BOG,Carol Argo is a terrific teacher of water Tai Chi and I have begun putting her instructions into practice.,1425427200,,106,4.631578947368421
8052109,5,B0007V1BOG,Excellent basic instruction.  Went from not knowing any of it to having a good base understanding and abilty to execute the moves in just 2 viewings.,1423612800,,149,4.730769230769231
8052110,4,B0007V1BOG,"I would give this a 5, except for one thing. I really really wish Carol would have a second option to watch an entire workout to just music. Doing Tai Chi in the pool (especially when surrounded by beautiful tropical landscaping) at sunset after a stressful day at work is the most ultimately relaxing way to end the day. Thanks Carol Argon!!",1408060800,,342,4.532258064516129
8052111,1,B0007V1BOG,"The Definitions,  Explanations, And Photography From Many Angles Are ExCellent.  The Actual Moves Are Not VeRy Powerful And I Was Looking FOr A Routine",1392940800,2,151,5.25
8052112,4,B0007V1BOG,"the moves in this dvd are wonderful additions to a water workout.  Ms. Argo is very clear in her instruction, and the underwater footage makes it even clearer.",1387670400,,159,4.678571428571429
