4897437,5,B005VPNJ2A,"Seeing so many so-called ""Platinum Editions"", it was deplorable that among them, there wasn't any good ""Platinum Girl Edition"" - until now!!! It was about time to honor Jean Harlow's Work which is now done with a 100th Anniversary Collection. This Collection features seven Harlow Classics formerly difficult to get in good quality: Bombshell (1933), The Girl From Missouri (1934), Reckless, Riff Raff (1935), Suzy (1936), Personal Property, Saratoga (1937). Some of them are rather weak movies, but even in those, Harlow is not only of a radiant and unique beauty, but offers a remarkably elaborated and distinguished performance which is worth watching. In other words, even a bad Harlow movie gives us the opportunity to see Harlow as a real actress and not only as a sex bomb. Every Harlow movie has some magic moments, and the magician is one of the most underrated actresses ever. And at least two movies (""The Girl From Missouri"" and ""Bombshell"") are real Harlow Classics and much more than light comedies. For example, it's de-lightful, it's de-licious, it's de-lovely to watch ""The Girl From Missouri"" on a big screen, together with a true friend (and Harlow expert), and to discover how lavishly and thoroughly the props are designed in beautiful art deco style. ""Riff Raff"" is also a good movie, ""Saratoga"" is odd but offers a wonderful Jean Harlow (and a bad double in the last third, because Harlow died during production). I haven't seen the other three movies so far, but according to Harlow biographers (Bettina Uhlich, Curtis F. Brown), they are somehow mediocre but offer nevertheless a fascinating look at both Jeans beauty and her art of acting. As I have had the same impression of ""Saratoga"", I assume that this is true. A must-have for every Harlow nerd.",1321315200,22,1777,4.966442953020135

4897440,4,B005VPNJ2A,"This long over-due box set to commemorate the 100 years since the birth of the legendary 1930's sex symbol Jean Harlow, is a great introduction to the enduring star. Many of her fans, myself included, may be disappointed in the overall content contained in the box set, since Harlow, who was a true original in every sense of the word, was larger than life and in our humble opinion, deserves more recognition and better treatment for her contributions to the motion picture industry. She is showcased here but more content could have and should have been included.

The packaging is good. The box itself has some gorgeous photos of Harlow stamped on it and the set includes a handful of glossy photo prints of some of her publicity shots (a great collector's items). The set includes 7 films from Harlow's extensive catalogue ranging from her best, to some minor lesser films.

My favorite is the classic ""Bombshell"" (1933). A funny satire that had Harlow play a role very close to herself in Lola Burns, a popular actress and sex symbol who is constantly hounded by the media, fans and her obnoxious press agent. Her good for nothing family, who are living off of her riches (which closely mirrored Harlow's real life) create havoc in her home and personal life and along with her good for nothing press agent, cause Lola to have an epic meltdown. She ends up shunning the spotlight and the media and decides she wants to settle down with a good man and child. What I love about this film is that, despite its age, the situations depicted are current and very familiar. The stars of yesteryear had the same problems with the press, media, fans, that stars of today have. More importantly, this is arguably Harlow's best performance on film and like her fantastic performance in ""Dinner at Eight"" (not included here) where she managed to steal the spotlight off several accomplished actors, Harlow practically steals this movie from her many co-stars. Despite her sexy persona and those gleaming platinum locks, she radiates an innocence on film that contradicts that brass, sexualized image and this made her unique among Hollywood sex symbols. ""Bombshell"" is a great comedy that has quirky characters, outrageous circumstances and a clever script yet the main attraction is still Harlow. This film will have you appreciating her great comedic talents.

Another favorite of mine is the charming ""The Girl from Missouri"" (1934). Harlow plays the ambitious Eadie Chapman, a young woman who is determined in finding herself a rich, successful man to marry. Harlow, again, is the main showcase here as her character despite being a bit shallow, is as charming as they come. Her chemistry with Franchot Tone is fantastic and the performances from the ensemble cast are solid. Although the film is a comedy, there are some dramatic moments with Harlow giving it her all.

""Reckless"" (1935) is another favorite of mine and co-stars William Powell (her real life lover at the time) and Franchot Tone. Although the film itself has many flaws and is not considered Harlow's best work, it is entertaining. The film is not a comedy but a musical drama with dark overtones. Harlow plays Mona Leslie, a famous and beloved theatre actress who marries a troubled, rich guy (Tone) who shortly thereafter, kills himself causing her life and career to take a downhill spiral. One of my biggest problems with this film is with some of the characters. Tone's character for instance, is badly written. He is the one who obsessively pursues Leslie, renting out an entire auditorium so he can watch her perform, goes incognito, sporting a clumsy, fake moustache just so he can have her to himself and when he finally wins her affections and marries her, he ends up regretting it so he belittles her and kills himself. Really? Annoying character aside, I view this film often as it does have its merits and is a curiosity item. Harlow does a lot of singing (dubbed) and dancing (a double was used) and since singing and dancing were not her skill set, it becomes all too obvious that the dancing vamp on stage or tap dancing in the crowded ball room, is not Jean Harlow. However, she never looked better. Her beauty in this film is at its peak and is reason alone to watch this just so you can marvel at the pale, luminous, platinum goddess wearing her trademark, skin tight gowns and oozing on screen charisma. The extravagant opening musical number is also noteworthy as is the last scene in the film. Leslie's poignant plea to her audience to give her a chance, is a major highlight with Harlow's beauty and presence, at the forefront.

Other films in the set include ""Riff-Raff""(1936), co-starring Spencer Tracy. Interestingly enough, this is the first film she made as a non platinum blonde. The change in image is striking and she would never play a platinum blonde again. ""Suzy"" (1936), is an enjoyable but lesser film that co-stars Cary Grant that combines several genres - comedy, drama, action. What is interesting about this film, is that some footage from Howard Hughes' 1930's epic ""Hell's Angel's"" was used in some of the aerial sequences towards the end. Again, Harlow looks good and she is far more successful lip-synching here than on ""Reckless"" but the characters in the film leave me cold. Especially Grant's character who despite his charm, is not likable and very difficult to sympathize with.

The least successful film in the bunch is ""Personal Property""(1937) co-starring Robert Taylor. Harlow and Taylor do their best with the material given but it falls flat and in my opinion, there is no chemistry between the two stars. There are charming moments but this film will remain one of Harlow's lesser efforts.

Harlow's last film ""Saratoga"" (1937), co-starring Clark Gable, is also included. Much has been said and written about this film which Harlow unfortunately did not complete due to her tragic death. It's interesting to watch to point out the scenes where the obvious Harlow double is on screen. You know, the woman holding the binoculars close to her face so we don't see her, or the one who has her back towards the camera or is wearing an oversized floppy hat that covers her face. Although ""Saratoga"" is not her greatest film, it remains a poignant piece of cinema. To watch the once luminous star as her fatal illness was consuming her and taking its toll on her appearance and to watch her final moments of her short life on screen is just plain sad.

Although I welcome this box set and it was long overdue, I still find it a bit disappointing. It does not fully showcase the legendary star since only a handful of her films are included. Granted, I did not expect the studio to include every movie in her archives but I do think that offering a little more would have been more fitting to this great actress. For example, there is a box set of Marilyn Monroe that contains not 7 but 17 of her movies. Also, the care that went into many of these DVD's is questionable. Most do not have any kind of extra's other than the film's trailer and some are not even in English, but in Spanish. No photo galleries, no documentaries, no star biographies .. nada. This box set is most definitely recommended but you will have to dig elsewhere to find other films where this platinum blonde sparkles.

It includes ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933) which contains, what I consider, one of her best and wittiest performances captured on screen, the delightful adventure comedy ""China Seas"" (1935) also starring Gable, the classic ""Libeled Lady"" (1936) costarring William Powell and Spencer Tracy and the dramatic ""Wife Vs Secretary"" (1936), which is the least interesting in the bunch for my tastes but her fans seem to love it. Also the DVD's in the TCM collection have some extra's that are worth noting. Especially the hour long documentary on her life, originally released in the 90's and hosted by Sharon Stone, and is included in the ""Dinner at Eight"" DVD. Other Harlow film's that are recommended includes the scandalous-for-its-time ""Red Headed Woman"" (1932) which is the film that finally unleashed Harlow's comedic talents and 1932's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dust/dp/B009RNK10K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dust</a>, which I consider one of her sexiest films.

4897453,5,B005VPNJ2A,"I am grateful for this set. ""Bombshell"" was Jean Harlow's favourite film (when she said this, I don't know) but it is a fast paced screwball comedy. Jean Harlow was an adept comedienne and she caught on quickly to the style of over-talking with Lee Tracey who had stage experience. This parody of Hollywood is the best film in the set. ""Bombshell"" is a pre-code film and most of Jean Harlow's finest films were during the pre-code era.
""The Girl From Missouri"" is a most enjoyable comedy starring Jean Harlow, Franchot Tone, Patsy Kelly, and Lionel Barrymore. This was made after the Code and Jean Harlow plays a ""good girl"". This film, along with ""Bombshell"", are two films that have been remastered.
""Reckless"" is a strange film. Jean plays a stage star purportedly loosely based on the Libby Holman scandal. It hits too close to home to Jean's own tragedy of her second husband's tragic death. She was married to MGM Executive Paul Bern whose death still remains a mystery. What is unusual about ""Reckless"" is that Jean plays a singer and dancer both of which she couldn't do at all. Her vocals are dubbed and her dancing leaves something to be desired. This melodrama was released after the Code was enforced so MGM Excutives were attempting to tone down her image. It is an enjoyable film in which Jean is ably supported by William Powell, Franchot Tone, Rosalind Russell and May Robson. Jean Harlow is so easy to watch that it is an enjoyable film. She also proves herself as a capable dramatic actress.
""Riffraff"" places Jean is a fish factory who loves Spencer Tracy who portrays an arrogant fisherman. They shout a lot but, of course they do marry. Jean ends up in a reformatory as she did in ""Hold Your Man"" which Warner Brothers ought to release. The film his it's comedic moments but it is essentially a drama and Jean gives a good performance. She is ably supported by Una Merkel and Mickey Rooney.
""Suzy"" is another drama for Jean, and this one has espionage in it during WWI. Jean is co-starred with Cary Grant, Franchot Tone, and Lewis Stone. It is better than ""Reckless"" and ""Riffraff"" in my opinion. Jean earned praise from the critics upon it's release and it was much deserved. ""Suzy"" has it's flaws, but it is an enjoyable film.
""Personal Property"" is a delightful piece of fluff. It was Jean's turn to be teamed with MGM's new star, Robert Taylor. Robert Taylor is not convincing as a comic actor but he is not bad. While watching this film I had wished they had cast Cary Grant instead. Jean Harlow shines in this film although she was very ill during the making of it. If she had lived, this is the type of film she might have been making: a sophisticated comedy.
""Saratoga"" was Jean's last film and she didn't complete it. She collapsed on the set and never returned to MGM. Much needed to be filmed and scenes were rewritten where Clark Gable asks Walter Pidgeon where she is and she is lying down with a headache. Rewrites were necessary to exclude scenes she was to be in a body double was used in scenes in which she could not be written out and a radio actress impersonates her voice. I have always found ""Saratoga"" sad to watch knowing how she had been ill for some time and she finally died at the age of 26. ""Saratoga"" was to be scrapped and remade with another actress. The public demanded to see her last film no matter how incomplete it was. This shows Jean's popularity was with the public.
This is a fine set of her later films from her career at MGM. I hope more will follow including the classic ""Red Dust"", ""The Secret Six"", and ""Hold Your Man"". Jean Harlow was a very important star of the 1930s and she deserves to have all of her films remastered and reissued. Jean Harlow embodied the 30s. The public could not get enough of her and neither will you once you see her films.",1322870400,7,3818,4.51878612716763
4897454,5,B005VPNJ2A,"During her brief screen career, Jean Harlow's distinctive, unmistakable glamour and captivating screen presence catapulted her to stardom. Nearly 75 years after her untimely death, she is still well-remembered by film buffs, and ripe for re-discovery by younger audiences unfamiliar with the original 'blonde bombshell'. Although a few of her choice performances surfaced on DVD long ago, a good portion of her remarkable work has been MIA for too long. Thankfully, we now have this superb 7-disc collection of vintage MGM classics, some which are well known, others which are less so, but each very much enjoyable and a testament to Harlow's incandescent stardom which will burn bright forever.

Each film is packaged individually, with the original MGM poster art on the cover, with all seven DVDs placed in a beautifully designed outer sleeve. In addition, the set includes an envelope containing a series of MGM studio portraits which capture the essence of the lady, re-produced with excellent quality. They are certainly something to marvel at.

The films themselves all look fine considering their age, a definite improvement from my old laser discs or VHS copies, and distinctively better that what they have been showing on recent TV broadcasts (""Bombshell"" is no longer constrasty and hazy, with inky blacks, and white whites....). Each DVD is presented with the respective film's original trailer (with the exception of ""Suzy""...I guess that one must be lost to the ages). Of particular note, two of the trailers have Spanish graphics, which perhaps are the only surviving copies. This is a nice touch, as I'd never seen them before, and the trailer for ""The Girl From Missouri"" seems to have had special material shot just for that trailer, with various MGM employees exhibiting their own respective excitement over 'the new Harlow picture'. Very cool, and a good example of the kind of phenomenon Harlow was at the time.

There are also some nifty audio rarities included as bonus features, including an hour-long Harlow/Robert Taylor radio performance (appropriately included on the disc of ""Personal Property""), and two MGM radio shows which promote ""Suzy"" and ""Reckless"". The ""Reckless"" radio show is particularly ironic, as the MGM announcer proclaims that audiences will hear JEAN HARLOW singing....when the singing voice on that radio show is clearly not that of Jean Harlow! This can be verified by the inclusion of the actual recording session material from ""Reckless"" which is included on the same disc's audio section. There are various portions of Harlow (and the great Nina Mae McKinney) heard performing excerpts from the big title song, only one of which sounded to me as being from the final film. Listening to these audio pieces is kind of like time travel. Fascinating.

Most highly recommended from this long-time Harlow fan!",1322352000,3,2856,5.215686274509804
4897455,4,B005VPNJ2A,"Given her short life and even shorter career, getting any dvd set featuring Jean Harlow's films is a treat for the most devoted of her fans. This set includes the following films in order of their release: Bombshell (1933), The Girl From Missouri (1934), Reckless(1935), Riff Raff (1935), Suzy (1936), Personal Property (1937), Saratoga (1937). Working chronologically, I just finished watching Suzy. While not all the films are necessarily great, for the most die-hard Harlow fan this set is great considering most of her films are, at best, difficult to get on dvd and are often most readily available of VHS.
For what it's worth, the film I like least is Saratoga which was her last film which was completed with a double after her untimely death at age 26. It lacks much continuity and was pieced together with bits and pieces of completed film. When watching it, I find it difficult to avoid playing 'find the faux Jean' which is unbelievably easy given that the final cut was fairly bad. Still, it deserves a viewing as Harlow's last work as well as a curious piece that documents Harlow's failing health. The end result transfixed this viewer because I couldn't believe that no one noticed how truly sick this lady was getting. The make-up artists did their best, but there is a lot that couldn't be hiddenin my opinion.
As for the rest of the films they range from small gems (The Girl From Missouri) to the marvelous Bombshell which seemed to echo Harlow's own life as a hot commodity being manipulated by her fairly worthless family with amazing comedic results. Some may seem like stronger entries, but they are all very enjoyable and pay tribute to her amazing style and talent.
The art work contained on the set is fairly good and reflects the Warners Vault collection. While some of the films have been supposedly remastered, those copies do not appear much different than the unmastered films. They look dated and murky, but do seems to improve.
Given the price at release of this set, I think this set should have been better than DVD-R copies and should have included archival extras such as candid film footage and a still gallery that paid tribute to one of the most unique stars that Hollyhood has ever seen. While I am happy to see this collection out there, I wish it had been a fitting tribute and not one that was pieced together to turn a quick buck.",1322265600,5,2375,4.697841726618705
4897456,3,B005VPNJ2A,"About a year ago, Warner Home Video released one of their ""TMC Classic Film Collections"" in honor of Jean Harlow and I reviewed that(as did many others) as a poor representation of this great star from Hollywood's Golden Era(1930's)considering that 2011 was her Centential year and she deserved much better treatment. I wasn't alone. Many Jean Harlow fans felt the same and voiced their opinions that her work at MGM(she made 16 films for that studio between 1931 and 1937) deserved at least a box set or even two. Well, the people at Warner must have been listening, because they have now released that box set titled: ""Jean Harlow: 100th Anniversary Collection"" thru their Warner Archive Collection. And that's the problem. While one could be thankful that the seven films in this collection cover her most important films, I have mixed feelings about this set after spending days watching these films(in the order that they were made). I suppose Warner Home Video considers this to be a companion set to the one listed above and this new box set resembles the ""Signature Series"" box sets that Warner has released in the past(with such stars as Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, etc.) and even boasts some extra studio picture cards. The problem as I stated before is that Warner chose to release these films thru their Warner Archive collection  with DVD-R copies instead of the regular DVD format, which is why I'm only giving it three stars.  Three of the films in this set are ""remastered editions""(whatever that means)and they are: ""Bombshell"", ""The Girl from Missouri"" and ""Reckless"". If that refers to the picture quality, then you would never know it. Overall, the picture quality is not very good. It gets better as you get toward the later films, such as ""Personal Property"" and ""Saratoga"" but for the most part the prints are terrible. And that's a shame because Warner Home Video has done such a superb job in the past with their restorations of ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Quo Vadis"", and this year's outstanding ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Citizen Kane"" all of which look stunning in Blu-ray. So why shouldn't Jean Harlow get the same treatment? It could be that the original negatives are no longer available. If that's the case, then there must be a master positive copy around the vaults somewhere. Or the Library of Congress might have better copies than the ones in this set. Personally, I don't think they were serious enough about Jean Harlow's films and therefore regulated her to the second rate Warner Archive division. I'm hoping that sometime in the future we'll see ""The Complete Jean Harlow: The MGM Years"" on regular DVD and Blu-ray with a pristine picture quality but I won't get my hopes up. As for the films in this set, I think ""Bombshell"" is the best of the seven. Jean plays a movie glamour queen which many think was about her but was really written about silent film star Clara Bow(the ""IT"" girl) and her family who was briefly engaged to the director of the film, Victor Fleming. It's essentially a screwball comedy that is so fast paced that I had to stop it several times just to catch my breath. The chemistry between fast-talking Lee Tracy and Harlow is great. Watching these films you'll see a lot of the same actors. That's because MGM paired Harlow with their biggest stars. She made six films with Clark Gable, five with Lewis Stone, four with both Franchot Tone and Una Merkel, Jean's wise-cracking gal pal. Merkel is a delight. Harlow's final two films, ""Personal Property"" and ""Saratoga"" are sad to watch. You can tell that she was gravely ill, although she herself probably didn't know it. She seems to have lost some of her timing and in the case of ""Personal Property"" there is no chemistry between her and Robert Taylor. In fact, Taylor shows more affection for his grandmother in the kissing scenes than he does Harlow. Go figure that out. Harlow's best co-star was Clark Gable(only represented once in this set with ""Saratoga"") but she holds her own with Spencer Tracy too. In conclusion, I would say that if you love Jean Harlow and have some disposable income then by all means purchase this set. It might be a long time before we Harlow fans get ""The Complete Jean Harlow"".",1322179200,59,4227,4.765347885402456
4897457,2,B005VPNJ2A,"With so many of Jean Harlow's films - even gems such as ""Bombshell"" - still missing on DVD, fans have been hoping the long-promised boxed set would finally arrive this year. A boxed set of her own on pressed DVD to celebrate her one hundredth birthday. Instead, what we get are a few overpriced DVD-Rs in the Warner Archive series and this boxset - on DVD-R as well. Surely this is very bad taste. Shame on you, Warner! A few of these films (""Reckless"", for example) have been available on DVD in Europe for a while - but not in the United States. Isn't it strange how the American cultural heritage is neglected by that company?

8487552,5,B005VPNJ2A,"Jean Harlow was Hollywood's original blonde movie queen. It has been said (on multiple occasions) that the term ''blonde bombshell'' was invented specifically to describe her. Blonde. Brassy. Beautiful. Beloved. Jean Harlow was the Marilyn Monroe of her time, a beautiful blonde with undeniable sarcastic wit. Her home studio, MGM, worried about Harlow's lack of classiness at the beginning of her career their in 1932. She wasn't as noble or grand as Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, or Joan Crawford, but it was her unique personality that eventually made her more popular than these so-called ''grand ladies''. Often compared to Mae West and Marlene Dietrich, it really isn't fair to compare Harlow to these two women; partly because their so different. While West and Dietrich bluntly embraced their controversial sexiness, Harlow offered a sense of kindness and reality that made her bawdy behavior more attractive to men and more accepting to women. Her cross-gender appeal made her world renowned movie comedienne. Jean Harlow is undeniably a movie star of great importance and some one who certainly shouldn't be forgotten. Before her death at 26 in 1937, she was one of the biggest actresses on the planet, but the Sweet Lord didn't have her stay with us on Earth long enough.

At MGM, Jean Harlow made fifteen movies, seven of which are presented here. The descriptions below are taken direct from the back of the box in which the seven movies come in.

Bombshell (1933/B&W/95 minutes): Glamour queen Lola (Harlow) is quitting the movie bizsomething her manipulative press agent (Lee Tracy) can't allow! Harlow's signature comedy is the ''the wittiest satire on Hollywood'' (David Shipman, The Story of Cinemo).

The Girl from Missouri (1934/B&W/72 minutes): Eadie's not easy! A plucky bachelorette (Harlow) intends to bag a New York millionaire... without abandoning her virtue. Patsy Kelly plays Eadie's fellow huntress.

Reckless (1935/B&W/97 minutes): Harlow goes dramatic as a Broadway star accused of murder after the death of her high-living, high-society hubby. With William Powell, the last real-life love of Harlow's short life.

Riffraff (1936/B&W/94 minutes): She works in a cannery. He's a fisherman. But their playful romance is fated to give way to a tragedy surrounding union activism. She's Harlow. He's Spencer Tracy. Their second pairing.

Suzy (1936/B&W/93 minutes): A heroine buffeted by fate! Harlow, Cary Grant, and Franchot Tone in a World War I triangle of romance and spy intrigue. Dorothy Parker is among the film's writers.

Personal Property (1937/B&W/84 minutes): Glittery fun! Debt-ridden socialite Harlow puts on a show of wealth to impress a suitor who's also making a pretense of fortune. Robert Taylor is the butler who sees through the ruses.

Saratoga (1937/B&W/94 minutes): The flag is up for thoroughbred fun as Harlow is engaged to a millionaire, but drawn to Clark Gable. ''Harlow's last performance is one of her best'' (John Douglas Eames, The MGM Story).

The earlier films in this collection, such as Bombshell (1933) and The Girl from Missouri (1934), we see the more controversial Pre-Code version of Jean Harlow. She is more vivacious and scandalous (by 1930s standards, anyway) than she is in the later movies. Reckless (1935) marks one of MGM's first attempts to present Harlow as more typical elegant MGM leading lady. Suzy and especially Riffraff (both 1936) are the weaker films included here. Personal Property, her final fully completed movie, and Saratoga (both 1937) offer us a glimpse of a maturing comedic actress destine for pure greatness.

To conclude my review, I just want to clarify that even though I have given this set 5 Stars, I really doesn't deserve it. Yes, there are seven movies and eight black-and-white mini-portraits included, but the quality and sound of the movies aren't too great. On a scale of 1 to 10, the video quality is around an 8, maybe 8.5. The audio quality is roughly a 9. I guess this isn't too bad, considering the age and nature of these films. Also, one must consider that these of DVD-R releases through the Warner Archive Collection. If I were being completely fair, I would give this set like 3.5 stars, because of the lesser video and audio quality, and the lack of special features. For the record, there are absolutely no extras! None!

I wouldn't call this a bad set, but maybe it will ensure a better release of Jean Harlow's movies in the future.",1437004800,5,4455,5.097393689986283
