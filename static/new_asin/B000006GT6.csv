Clip is ""And We Dance"" followed by the entire live concert, after the concert ends, the original video clip ""Day By Day"" starts finishing the tape, a must have for any Philadelphia's Hooters fans! Highly Recommended.",1421712000,,389,4.492957746478873
7904560,4,B000006GT6,"I had NERVOUS NIGHT on vinyl many years ago, never quite got around to replacing it on CD, and really just kind of forgot about it.  I did pick up this out-of-print VHS at a library book sale a few years ago and, finally watching (and paying ATTENTION to)it, I had to admit that these guys were really pretty good.  Of course, like 99% of all recording acts who've ever broken through, they weren't able to sustain the level of success their '85 debut seemed to promise.  It's a shame really, although it is somewhat reassuring to know that the ""creative forces"" behind the group (songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian) were at least able to parlay their band's success into pretty successful songwriting and A&R careers.

The fact that this release is only available of VHS, however, suggests how quickly their band's star did fall.  Of course, there are any number of mid-80s rock videos that never made it to DVD, but NERVOUS NIGHT would seem to have deserved better.  It is--in the main--a concert video, bookmarked by two of the band's commercial vids (""And We Danced"" and ""Day by Day"")on either end of the live show.

Actually, I say ""live show"" with a bit of trepidition, the production values are so perfect and the performances SOOO spot on, that I had to wonder if they weren't effectively lip-synched.  Of course, it WAS the 80s and slick was in (and, yes, that included GRACE Slick, but that's just it; 60s sloppiness and spontaneity was out, and one could demand--and often get--virtual studio quality sound in many live venues).  But this could be a case where concert footage was later matched up with the studio tracks.  Was it live?  Or was it Memorex?  Since I know longer have the vinyl, I can't really compare the performances on the video against the studio versions.

So I can't be sure.  But in a way, it almost doesn't matter.  I don't doubt the Hooters' musicality either way.  The video, like so much of the recorded music of the era, is very polished, very slick product.  But it's also very tuneful, very varied and really quite intelligent (lyrically AND in terms of musical sophistication).  As an extended (but still quite short) video, it's quite enjoyable.  The Hooters had their rock star moves down pretty good.  They seem pretty poised and confident--if not really particularly glam.

I'd have to listen to more of the band's entire oeuvre to be sure, but I'm starting to think that their rep as a band of talented journeymen isn't a tad unfair.  Songs like ""All You Zombies"" and even ""Where Do the Children Go"" have a bit of mystery to them that suggest keen intelligence--if not exactly ""the vision thing.""",1360022400,,2673,4.727861771058316
