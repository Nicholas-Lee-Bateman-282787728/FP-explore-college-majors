5053076,5,B0072VFXKC,"My wife and I have collected almost all of the Rifftrax shorts. So far we'd rate this one and Shortstoberfest as two of the best I've seen so far. My wife and I watched it on a Friday night and got headaches we laughed so hard. Then we watched it again the very next night with our son, and again we got a headache. Probably the best entertainment deal around.",1390348800,,360,4.1571428571428575
5053077,5,B0072VFXKC,"Put on your hiking boots (you'll see why with ""Walking to School.""  I have no idea where the guys dug these stinker shorts up, but OMG am I thankful they did.  It provides laughter long after they are done - but the odor still lingers.  A couple of them, like ""At Your Fingertips: Grasses"" and ""At Your Fingertips: Boxes"" are so bad - you just have to experience them for yourself.  And for those that have no idea how to use a calendar (and it seems there many be some) - this one is for you.",1383609600,4,493,4.104166666666667
5053078,4,B0072VFXKC,"This is a fun, budget Rifftrax DVD with ten short films. The only extra feature is a chapter index. These short films span the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's. The last short was made in 1990! This DVD contains Walking to School, At Your Fingertips Grasses, Paper and I, At Your Fingertips Boxes, County Fair, The Red Hen, Courtesy A Good Eggsample, One Turkey Two Turkey, The Calendar How to Use It and Tooth Truth with Harv and Marv. The audio commentary by ex-MST3K cast members Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett is funny. These shorts are a nostalgic blast from the past. The Calendar short looks and feels like cheesy 1970's pop music! This DVD is worth watching.",1363737600,8,681,4.683333333333334
5053079,5,B0072VFXKC,"Some shorts are just made for good riffing.  Others, not so much.  Even the ones that just kinda lay there like a suffocating fish on the floor of a bass boat are funny at the hands of the masters, and this disc doesn't disappoint.

Personally, I'm baffled by the ""At Your Fingertips"" set of films.  For some reason, they *really* leave me feeling uneasy, and if not for the skilled commentary I think I'd need to take some antidepressants after seeing them in the raw.  Contrast that to ""Paper and I"", which will simply give me nightmares.  All of them make me laugh with my big Simpsons teeth showing through my gaping maw.",1363564800,3,625,4.486725663716814
5053080,5,B0072VFXKC,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is something new to me.  But it is fun.  It is a movie, a bad one with a couple of guys riffing it.  If you do not know what that is, well you know how when you watch a bad movie with your friends and you make fun of it through out the movie... well there you go.  That is what a riff is.  They say funny things about the mistakes in the movie, and bad acting and whatever else they find that is funny.",1362182400,,431,3.797752808988764
5053081,3,B0072VFXKC,"Some of these are funny.  Some are mediocre.  I know these guys have set a very high standard for themselves with such hilarious classics as ""Cooking Terms"" and ""One Got Fat.""  But both the selection of short subjects here and the riffs are just not up to par.  Still many laughs, just not as many as we so rightly expect from the boys.  Try another collection of theirs instead.",1362096000,,379,4.434782608695652
5053082,5,B0072VFXKC,I love mst3k and this looked like fun. It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.,1355184000,,90,3.55
5053083,5,B0072VFXKC,"I have most of the Rifftrax dvd's and this is one of the best.  My favorites are the talking bag, how to read a calendar, and the walking eggs shorts. Very funny stuff and i hope Mike and the gang release more in the future!",1348617600,,224,3.977777777777778
5053084,5,B0072VFXKC,"All of the Rifftrax short collections are excellent, but I think this might be the best - consistently funny from start to finish. The infamous live ""Grass"" short is here in studio form, with some different jokes. There's also another short from the same company that I actually thought was even funnier. 10 bucks is a great price for this - highly recommended.",1348358400,8,361,4.746031746031746
5053085,5,B0072VFXKC,"Big improvement over the last few shorts DVDs! If releasing them one at a time instead of in pairs means more high grade shorts per DVD, then keep releasing them one at a time. I'll laugh every time I hear the names Gary or Carl from now on...",1344988800,4,243,4.083333333333333
5053086,5,B0072VFXKC,Hilarious delivered quickly best v-day gift for my husband definitely recommend,1426032000,,79,6.2727272727272725

5053088,5,B0072VFXKC,"Tons of comedy gold to be mined in these old life lesson training films. ""Walking To School"" the creepy ""At Your Fingertips: Boxes"" and the demented & disturbing ""Paper and I"" are the highlights of this volume of RIFFTRAX's ongoing assault on the boring educational short films many of us suffered through in our youth. If you never had to sit in school and squirm in your chair as your senses were assaulted by these cinematic sand burrs then you're in for a twisted treat. Plenty of laughs on this DVD collection, at a price that won't break the bank. Someone help me. I'm addicted to these damn things!  5 STARS",1424736000,,614,4.531531531531532
5053089,4,B0072VFXKC,"Two of the shorts in this collection made it into the Rifftrax Live shows: the incomprehensible ""At Your Fingertips: Grasses"" with the live REEFER MADNESS, and the creepy ""Paper & I"" with the live HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.

The rest are a mixed bag, but I'd single out ""The Red Hen"" for some particularly strong riffing, ""One Turkey Two Turkey"" for the catchiest theme song ever devoted to a film about animal cruelty, and ""Tooth Truth with Harv and Marv"" for somehow combining a Linnea Quigley lookalike in full '80s regalia with two animated, barefoot hobos who attempt to become the spokespersons for proper dental hygiene.",1422230400,3,623,4.877358490566038

5053093,5,B0072VFXKC,I cannot believe that they gave somebody a Ph. D.. to produce this dross for us to  watch while we grew up.  Now I know what the problem is. Thank you Rifftrax for setting us straight!,1407974400,,184,4.083333333333333
5053094,5,B0072VFXKC,Wish the bot were back but you can't have everything.  I have not come across any of the RIFFTRAX that I have not like they are all awesome so far even without the BOTs....  Long Live MST3K,1402099200,,189,4.081081081081081
5053095,5,B0072VFXKC,The best collection of shorts we've seen! We didn't stop laughing for a long time! This is well worth the price.,1394496000,,112,4.380952380952381

8509020,5,B0072VFXKC,"I've been a fan of MST3K for years, and RiffTrax follows in that grand tradition.  The shorts are educational films or fillers shown to school children.  Tooth Truth is the most recent at 1990, but by far the stupidest film of the bunch and left me wondering how drunk the director and producer were when they made it.  The jokes are spectacular as always and sometime tasteless, but that's what I bought it for.",1455753600,,412,4.54054054054054
8509021,5,B0072VFXKC,MST3K LIves!!!! Thanks to these guys.  Funny as hell as in laugh out loud funny.  Outstanding!,1454457600,,94,4.8125
8509022,5,B0072VFXKC,One of my favorite collections yet. The mind numbing teaching of how to read a calendar was probably my favorite,1452816000,,112,4.65
8509023,5,B0072VFXKC,If you're new to rifftrax.  Start with the shorts DVDs. In my opinion they are the funniest you can get. The shorts on their own are generally funny. The commentary put most all of them over the top. My 14-year-old son and I Watch these together and he laughs more than even I do.,1450224000,,280,4.185185185185185
8509024,4,B0072VFXKC,More of the same. Well crafted.,1442275200,,31,4.333333333333333
8509025,5,B0072VFXKC,Shorts just like mama used to make 'em!  The guys from MST3K make these alot more fun than when we watched them in school!,1431043200,,122,4.083333333333333
8509026,3,B0072VFXKC,Not as funny as I thought. But still worth it,1427760000,,45,3.6
