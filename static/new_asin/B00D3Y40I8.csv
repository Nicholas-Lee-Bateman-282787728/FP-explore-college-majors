5773304,4,B00D3Y40I8,I get tired of his Old Dad's Dirty Mouth! that ruins it for me But Rick is So Smart & Cory is a Whiney Baby & they Pick on Chumley All the Time & that Gets Tiring! But the Concept is Great Except too many Guns!,1395964800,2,210,3.5869565217391304
5773305,1,B00D3Y40I8,"Not a rip-off but pretty darn close, The Best of Pawn Stars is not recommended. Do not buy this! Waste of money.",1391904000,,112,4.136363636363637

5773308,1,B00D3Y40I8,"It's really sad that History Channel treats the fan base this way by trying to cheat us into buying the same Pawn Stars episodes in a repackage.  Fans want complete seasons of unreleased episodes. Instead, this set contains mostly season 2 episodes.  You are better off just buying season 2 which was the last release to contain the complete season.

Better yet, just sign up for Amazon Prime and you can watch the first 5 entire seasons for free.

This is nothing but a cheap money grab by History Channel.",1379289600,14,507,4.6
5773309,5,B00D3Y40I8,"My Husband & I are absolutely hooked on the Pawnies & have every DVD. But A&E/History have stopped after Volume 5 & Take a Seat from 2011. Episodes are missing & I keep bugging them to release MORE! Just got this yesterday: 2 Discs that are ""Handpicked by the Creators"" WHO??? Basically it's another Reissue: 8 Episodes from 2009/2010/11 & the epic Pick Pawn Polish from 2011: Features: Secret Santa/Rope-A-Dope/Put Up Your Dukes/Spooning Paul Revere/Sharks & Cobras/PICK PAWN POLISH,Pawn Shop Pinot & Pezzed Off. Yes, these are Classic, but why haven't Volume 6,7 & 8 & beyond have been considered? They SHOULD have released COMPLETE 2009,10,11,12,13 & INCLUDE the Crossovers of PPP & the Sturgis Gems from Pickers & Restoration as we enjoy these shows & Counting Cars since it's all Leftfield Productions. I wrote them as well to no avail. It's a shame as I'm sure we're not the only 1's who dig Pawn Stars & are frustrated by the lack of Episodes. Example: Volume 1 has 2 Discs but it's NOT everything from 2009. Volume 2 has 4 Discs but has a few 2009's on Disc 1. VERY confusing & frustrating. If you're a loyal Pawnie, you'll certainly LUV this in spite of being too short but Pick Pawn Polish makes this worthwhile. Period!",1377388800,8,1230,4.699074074074074

Includes a side tale about a gal that works there by the name of Peaches who shows up late and has to work the night shift. Always something to learn, some people get greedy.
