6446868,2,B00KTZAKLU,Story was alright but the animation segment was more like the digital comics which I thing suck. Also in scare on the bad dude was on the right side of his face when he was on the horse and the left side of his face after he jumped done. if the used CGI for the whole movie and upgraded it visuals instead of intermixing the lame animation segments the movie would have been much better.,1409961600,,387,4.173333333333333

6446870,3,B00KTZAKLU,"Heavenly Sword is a CGI animated movie based on the PS3 game from 2007.  Not owning a PS3 I haven't played the game, so Im judging this movie on a stand-alone basis.

Heavenly Sword is entertaining, but not too engaging. Its like someone else said: it really does feel as if the cut scenes were removed from the game and strung together with a reworked plot to make a movie. Which is not good when you haven't even played the game and you get that feeling.

The game's story and mythos revolves around the titular Heavenly Sword, a blade said to have been wielded by an unnamed Heavenly deity against a demonic warlord called the Raven Lord.  After the battle was won and the Raven Lord defeated, the sword was left in the mortal world, becoming the center of wars over its power. The fighting made the sword lust after the life of its users, eventually killing them after a short time.  A warrior tribe finally took charge of the sword, ending the wars and pledging to keep it safe and unused for the world's own good.  Among the tribe, a legend said that the sword's original wielder would be reborn in the year of the ""fire-horse"", and that this figure would unite the world's scattered tribes and lead the world to peace. (Synopsis via Wikipedia)

***SPOILER ALERT***

By all accounts the movies plot diverges greatly from the games. Key difference being that Nariko and Kai are true sisters: Master Shen was ashamed of his failure to deliver the Chosen One for his clan so he set off across the country, sexually assaulting various women to spread his seed around. And it worked: he fathered a son- Loki- whom once discovered everyone now assumes is the Chosen One. Problem is Loki took off to seek his fortune, and couldn't have picked a worse place to do so- Bohans fortress. So the girls have to set off to find their little brother and hand him the sword- smack dab in enemy HQ.

***END SPOILER***

The story doesnt make some things clear and leans on a few cliches. Nariko runs around challenging entire armies while barely wearing any clothing ala Red Sonja. Why she couldn't wear even some piecemeal armor is beyond me. King Bohans connection to the Raven King is never really shown until the final scene, and even then you have to think about it for a minute to realize whats happening. He also rules the kingdom from a fortress built inside a volcano riiight. More like the creators were enamored with the Fire Nations Boiling Rock Prison from Last Airbender. The steampunk elements were kinda distracting- like Kais repeating cylinder crossbow and her appearance (all she was missing was goggles), the gliders and catapults employed by Bohan heck- the gondolas they had to use just to get to his fortress! Whatever, man.

The CGI and motion capture aren't as smooth as youd think theyd be, but they're decent enough. Still not a fan of all these folks with western features running around an Asian setting, either. The music doesnt play much into things, but as a soundtrack/score buff I kept an ear out for it. Wasnt bad; did the job to underscore the emotional and dramatic sense of the moment. The action is 100% video game/wuxia like youd expect- leaping, twirling, twisting, diving, ten-against-one, etc. Cant forget Flying Fox and Whiplash- the latter whom Id like to have seen more of. Foxs illusions were when I started getting annoyed: there was no reason to suspect hed had that kind of power and seemed like a complete @$$ pull.

Voice acting is ok; often times it was out of sync with the characters facial movements- like good ol fashioned bad kung fu overdubbing. The actors themselves were good: Anna Torv reprises her role as Nariko, Ashleigh Ball plays Kai; Alfred Molina (whos instantly recognizable) as King Bohan replaces Andy Serkis who was unavailable and Nolan North fills multiple roles as supporting characters Master Shen, Roach and Kyo.

Heavenly Swords not a bad way to spend 90 minutes- it just couldve been a lot better. And stick around for the end credits for a possible hint of things to come.",1409788800,4,4041,4.682651622002821
6446871,5,B00KTZAKLU,"I am a huge fanatic of the original Heavenly Sword on PS3.  It is in my top 5 PS3 games and definitely on my list of all time favorite games.  Needless to say, I was truly excited for the announcement of this film.  The reason being is that this franchise has been dead since the original release in 2007.  The only other mention of the game was Nariko's appearance in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

If you enjoyed the game, you will enjoy this film.  I was a bit worried about the introduction of a certain new character, but I was relieved to find out that the focus remained on Nariko and Kai and retained its female empowerment message.  There are also a couple of new minor characters, and the character Shen has been significantly altered.  But all of the original characters are in this film and have great fight scenes accompanying them:  Whiptail, Roach, Flying Fox, and King Bohan.

Anna Torv reprises her role as Nariko, and does an excellent job as one would expect from the original performer of the character.  I also believe Kai's actress returns (or if not, she sounds exactly like her!).  Bohan however, is not portrayed by Andy Serkis, and is replaced by Alfred Molina, who I think does an excellent job.

I really enjoyed this film based on its loyalty to the source material.  There are several iconic scenes and images from the original game that return in this film.  The new characters add to the storyline, but do not detract from the characters we came to see.  In the end, more Heavenly Sword is a beautiful thing, and for those hoping for a sequel, prequel, or spinoff, stick around through the credits!",1409702400,2,1637,4.612456747404845
6446872,4,B00KTZAKLU,"I rented the HD version and it looked wonderful.  Animations are smooth and voice acting was great as well.  Anna Torv thankfully reprises her role as the fire red Nariko (I'm glad that she's still loyal to the character even after her success on Fringe).  Kai was just as strange but still quirky, funny and enjoyable as ever.  Hell,  even Doc Oc did a wonderful job filling in the shoes of Andy Serkis. And whats this??  Nolan North even lends his voice to the film as well.  I love that guy!

The movie is basically a retelling of the game.  It's paced well,  has good dialogue (no swearing at all I'm happy to report)  and overall if you're a fan of the game or have been wanting/hoping/*praying* for a sequel, remake,  (or even a friggin' trophy patch haha) the movie will fill your appetite.  At least it did for me.

Ever since this movie was announced I've always had this strong feeling that it's testing the waters to gauge interest in a sequel (as of this moment though I feel like Sony would do a remake for PS4 and develop a sequel from there. Especially considering the opening credits  mention,  ""Based on the video game *franchise*"".  And the mid credits scene had me thinking about a sequel too... Hmmm... Now my mind is back to where it was when Ninja theory announced something of a sequel (that was later abandoned)  some years ago.  Thanks Sony,  now it's 2010(?) all over again!!  Hahaha

All kidding aside- It was an enjoyable film that stays true to the source material. Definitley worth the HD rental and now Im considering purchasing the Blu-Ray so i can own it and watch the special features, if it has any.",1409702400,2,1634,4.505119453924915
6446873,1,B00KTZAKLU,"WOW! Where to start. How about... This is one of the worst movie adaptations of a video game ever. I mean, what was the budget for this production exactly? Heavenly Sword was originally released on the PS3 back in 2007, now at the time the graphics were fairly decent for an early PS3 game, believe me when I say that the graphics in this film are less detailed and polished than the original game was, in other words, it looks terrible. What this production is sorely missing are the incredible talents of Andy Serkis, as not only the voice and motion capture actor for king Bohan, but also the games dramatic director and co writer of the story. They've essentially taken a steaming dump on everything good Andy Serkis did for the game. The character and facial animation is generic at best; all the wonderful motion capture that made the game so amazing is gone; the dialogue between all the characters is borderline silly; the voice actors themselves sound like they're in a cheap recording booth, and the story barely resembles that of the game. Heck, they could have just simply taken the original game, cut all the gameplay moments out, compiled the remaining story segments together into a short movie and it would still have more depth than this travesty. Don't waste your money on this.

If my short and to the point review isn't enough, i suggest reading Kotaku's review and watching their side by side comparison video clip.

6446874,1,B00KTZAKLU,"Heavenly Sword while not the worlds greatest game still had a good and interesting story. So when they decided to make it a movie I felt they had everything they needed to make something great so long as they stayed true to the core content.

*spoilers*
Instead they rob the clan, shen, and pretty much the entire cast of all the things that made them great. Turning Shen into a rapist traveling the country side in some mad quest to create the chosen one is the exact opposite of taking something great and doing good things with it. Nariko's importance and her sacrifice seem some what lessened by comparison. Her relationship with Kai is twiddled down to nothing more than her sister being a little nuts. The meaningfulness and madness of Kai is given less importance right down to the fight with flying fox. Just isn't true to the game and it feels less for it. Don't get me wrong I don't mind a bit of creative license, but its almost like no one thought to ask how these changes would impact the story. Then the introduction of meaningless characters, a cast system, and a temple for nomads just completely trounced on any logic you might have had going in.

*end of spoilers*

As far as the rest of the content goes, the hand animated animations are some what less by comparison to the almost entirely motion captured performances of the original game. That's sad considering that was one of the huge selling points. I was willing to excuse that much given the studio and budget. What I don't get is the relatively phoned in performances or the scoring for this film. I hate to go back to the game yet again, but the scoring to the game had much more feeling and was a character itself providing definition for what was going on. Scoring in this movie was sub par and just as bad as some of the voice acting. The voice acting caught me off guard given how well Ana Torv did in the original game versus the final content. Perhaps she felt she was getting into something that held just as much meaning, then got to the studio and realized just how badly this game was bastardized from its original content.

If you're bored and are just curious, just rent it. You won't be watching this again and you'll be better off playing the game. If you're curious about the story of Heavenly Sword and either don't play games or don't have time for the game, then do yourself some justice and find the games cut scenes off youtube, they do more justice strung together than this work ever will. Otherwise just forget about heavenly sword.",1409616000,18,2533,4.5119825708061

6446908,3,B00KTZAKLU,"It was good enough to approve production but not good enough to approve a respectable budget.

The bad:
Limited budget.  They couldn't afford to fully animate everything, so sometimes the background characters will walk like Minecraft characters (ie - float through the air with their arms and legs doing scissor movements).  There was even a scene where the main character was rowing the oars in reverse to make the boat go forward, because reshoots would go over budget.

The good:
The main character is very well proportioned, and basically wears armor that consists of not a whole lot more than underwear.  The camera never leaves her side, and the angles are very gratuitous.

Equals:
A decent flick for teens.",1525046400,2,715,4.966386554621849
6446909,3,B00KTZAKLU,"The Movie was OK but really the cut scene movies from the game are better. The plot is better sans the 'brother' sub plot this added. The gameplay fight scenes aren't as finished as the extra animation for this but the cinematic portions of the fights are the same. There's more 'show' and less tell through exposition in the cut scene movies from the game and more action. The characters a better done too, this is almost like they needed to add to a great story but all the did was bloat it and make it lesser.

Don't get me wrong, this is decent but you're better off going to Youtube and searching 'Heavenly Sword' and selecting 'cut scene movie'.",1524960000,,651,4.425

It has a very good plot with pently of character development and the characters reach out and grab you from the very start. The story line is great and the things the main characters go thru really keep you glued to the screen. The only thing I didn't like was the ending but endings like this movie has can really be forgiven by the overall great story. (BTW: The ending has a bright side too as to who will really be able to use the sword.) I'm not going into the story line or plot as one should experience it for them selves.

Nar was selected to outreach her lost brother, the Chosen One.  She was given this Sword and accompanied by sister Kai, a skilled killer with
arrows.  After many battles, Kai was finally defeated and hanged.  Nar came late and carried the almost dying Kai back to their native land.
Kai was ready to die. Their brother's death was announced.  With one thought of revenge in mind, Nar fought and killed the entire enemy army with this Sword.  Feeling exhausted and angry, Nar did not want to live anymore.  She gave all her energy and breath to Kai.  Thereby, Nar died and Kai revived.

6446955,5,B00KTZAKLU,"This movie can be described in only one word: amazing. True, the animation is nothing to write home about, even for 2014, and motion capture technology has been done before, but that shouldn't detract from the fact that this movie is an absolute joy to watch.

SERIOUS SPOILERS: Not only is this movie fun to watch, but it has unexpected twists I didn't see coming, being one of those people who didn't play the PS3 game this movie is based on. Themes of neglect, betrayal, and even (cough) the death of the ones we love all play a vital part in the twisting 80-some minutes of the plot. Add to the fact that the final battle against the army of King Bohan (who is decently portrayed by Alfred Molina of Spider-Man 2 among other films) was stunning right up to the fight against the newly god-like king... pure enjoyment, right up to the tragic ending. If you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about.

Despite how much I enjoyed it however, and I feel like I'm a complete idiot for bringing out the faults of my own favorite movies, but I realize motion capture technology still needs some improvement. Sometimes, the lips were hardly read up to the point where the characters sounded like they were speaking, but their lips were hardly moving. Also, I spotted a few technical problems here and there - Bohan's horse slightly sliding while it was walking (very noticeable if you're paying close attention), the green ball on Master Shen's staff glitching a bit like it was a real video game, Flying Fox illusions becoming WAY oversized at one point... but, hey, movies can't be perfect.

Bumps aside, the acting was decent for a direct-to-movie release, Alfred Molina is truly a good actor, kudos for Anna Torv and Ashleigh Ball for reprising their roles as Nariko and Kai respectively, decent if not excellent animation, and is a truly wonderful movie true to its video game counterpart. If any, at least rent it first, but buy it if you can. 5/5. No, 10/10.",1472688000,,1971,4.641833810888252

6446959,2,B00KTZAKLU,"Visually I thought it was ok and I've seen much worse CG animation. The characters looked decent for the most part, but could have used more variety in their movements. It also didn't have a lot of variety of background scenery. It mainly takes place in a desert setting and in the villain's keep, so they definitely cheaped out and cut corners. I did prefer how this looked to abominations like Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker CG anime.

However, what really kills this movie is how they handled the story. It was at times very choppy and seemed to skip transition scenes. One bad guy character shows up with no previous introduction. The voice acting ranged from decent all the way down to terrible. Alfred Molina did an ok job as King Bohan and Ashleigh Ball did very good as Kai. The particularly cringe worthy acting job goes to the blacksmith brother. I think the story had potential but they just mishandled it. They wanted to have one of the themes be about discrimination towards girls, but they hit you over the head with it and it came out clunky. They wanted to have a close relationship between two sisters, but didn't develop it to really earn it. I think they also wanted to have a morally grey story, but they didn't have the chops to go fully thru with it. What one character does is pretty bad, but he's forgiven at the end which made me roll my eyes. Fans of the game may get more out of this movie than I did.",1471910400,,1428,4.388679245283019

Heavenly Sword the game was about a woman overcoming a lifetime of rejection and fulfilling a prophecy her people believed was supposed to be fulfilled by a man. Wonderful game, actors, and amazing graphics, now here comes a movie that pushes down the female heroine to play fetch the male hero. What did this game piss some male director off so badly that they had to go male washing it so that a macho man could be the hero of the movie. The movie made no sense, it didn't play well into the game at all, the time line was way off, and it just irritated the crap out of me; pointless waste of time.

6447018,3,B00KTZAKLU,"Introducing this weeks $5 DVD bargain bin gamble! A videogame-based movie that would have totally blown my mind if I was twelve.

Im not going to go too hard on this movie, because Im basically a child on the inside.

Important notice: I have never played the video game, so I cant make any comparison there. Id definitely want to play it if I had a Playstation 3.

First, this movie has the most generic fantasy setup Ive ever seen.
1. Prophecy of the chosen one? Check.
2. Cursed sentient sword to be wielded only by the chosen one? Check.
3. Firstborn inferior daughter born instead of son? Check.
4. Evil king whos probably related to the heroes? Check.
5. Long 2D animation prologue containing this exposition? Check.

The animation is so-so. Its like a videogame cut scene, except you never get to play through any parts. There were some pretty cool action sequences, and I even went back and watched some of them again. The boss battles had some cool creature villains too.

The not-so-good: I thought it was dubbed into English because the lips don't always match the dialogue too well, but it wasn't, and just is bad animation. Also, there's a scene where the heroines find someone they're looking for, and his acting is comically bad. He sounds totally spaced out, and his line reading is strange. However, he's only in the movie for about 3 minutes.

Not many surprises story-wise, but I did like butt-kicking sisters Nariko and Kai. There are some mildly interesting themes about family in this otherwise bland movie. Overall, it had a goodbut barely noticeablemessage.

Another surprise to me is that it was actually older-kid appropriate. No nudity, some bloody violence*, minor references to rape (a father having illegitimate children against the mothers' will, nothing shown), and one minor swear word. If your kids like movies like ""Tomb Raider"" and the recent Mummy series, theyll probably get a kick out of ""Heavenly Sword"".

I would have given it 2 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up in honor of my childhood sense of what was ""awesome"".

*Many people get shot with arrows, and there's a spurt of blood, but it miraculously disappears after that. Likewise, several people get stabbed with swords, but then you don't see a wound or blood on the sword. Someone gets beheaded, but it's so quick that you don't see much. Just poor animation, but it keeps it in the PG-13 range. A character even gets *run through* with a sword and should have bled to death within minutes, but thanks to the magic of poor animation, does not (I don't think they are even shown bleeding).

As always, if do want to show it to your kids, and you are worried about the violence, preview it. You might be bored, but whatever.",1428710400,,2717,4.713080168776371

The game gives backstory on the character that is not in game, but the game gives backstory that is not in the movie. I have completely two different opinions on Nariko's father. They portray him one way on the game then another way in the movie. I will not spoil anything, but one will make you hate Nariko's father compared to the other in my opinion. This movie is a must have if you like the game and worth checking out. I cannot say one is better than the other except you can play the game and it is a lot longer. The movie is like an alternate universe compared to the PS3 hit. The main plot still stays the same, where other information is different and completely new. I am glad it is not 100% like the game, that may be boring. Andy Serkis(Gollum L.O.T.R) voices King Bohan in the game, where Alfred Molina(Doctor Octopus, spiderman 2)  voices him in the movie, still cool. Thomas Jane(Punisher) has a role in movie as well.

6447057,5,B00KTZAKLU,"For one I really enjoyed the game most especially for the subject: Sometimes the reality behind the ""legendary"" isn't as grand as everyone wants to believe it is and heroism is always a good thing.

When, I found that there was a movie for the game, I thought: Hey, why the hell not?

I have to say; though it does not mirror the game exactly (and why would it?) it is an very very good PARALLEL to the game and hits all the major points like it's supposed with some added extras and uniques twists. The movie expanded on its central theme a bit further than the game did. Presenting a more in-depth or different perspective on what Nariko had to put up with and overcome adding more weight to the character development. I liked how Master Shen was presented as someone who failed to overcome not only his own egotism along with his own poor management of expectations but ultimately failed in passing the test the fate laid before him in regards to the legend. There is a bit more background explained about Kai which was great cause now I like her just as much as I like Nariko (asides from her just being a violently happy wild-card personality), she's also presented to be a little bit more resilient in the movie. And Nariko is flawless in her character in the movie as she is in the game. A perfect paradox as both Hero and Anti-hero.

Even though I can't stand Bohan, I do like that he is depicted as more of an intelligent-ego-maniacal-genocidal-warmonger in the movie in contrast to the typical nasty-gluttonous-narcissistic-lecherous element of disgust he was in the game. However no matter how he is presented, it's guaranteed you're not supposed to like guy but feel very very sorry for him.

However my one tiny complaint is a superficial one really: (pardon potential *SPOILER ALERT*)

Who in the hell did they cast as ""Loki's"" voice actor? Steven Hawkings possesses more animation when he communicates than that guy did. But luckily he wasn't around long enough for you to have to put up with it for too long.

(The CGI quality: I make no negative comment about it: because it could've been worse. It could've been like ""FF: Advent Children"": great cgi and animation; horrible f-ing storyline).

All in all, I give this movie five stars, because it doesn't muddle the glory of the game. Everything in the movie that differs from the game is believable in the universe that is ""Heavenly Sword"". My advice to you if you are on the fence about watching it: Don't expect the movie to be exactly like the game. If you can look at it as if you never played the game or as if the movie came first. Or just simply look at it as a parallel-- a different perspective.

Worth watching. Worth adding to your collection of video game movies.

Enjoy.",1417996800,8,2751,4.57520325203252

Cons: As others have mentions, the CGI itself is just a small step above the game graphics.  The main characters are very detailed but the no name NPCs took a hit to quality. Make peace with the fact you're going to be watching an 86 minute cutscene ahead of time.

The story was out of this world, there were ample surprises and unexpected 'Plot Twists' to keep me on the edge of my seat! I'm a lover of the Playstation 3 Game (although I haven't completed it yet), and I think that this film and the game go hand-in-hand! I think that this way (CGI) was the BEST way possible to make a move based on a game, because then the characters look EXACTLY like they do in the game, PLUS the action sequences aren't subjected to the limitations of Live Action film-making (humans cannot perform all of the fancy moves of the game, being that they are held back by gravitational and technological shortcomings. Also, Live Action films seem to usually be made by either someone who's clueless about the game and/or someone who wishes to 'give it their own spin', thereby ruining everything, by not sticking to the source material. Just as musical artists ruin their own hit songs when performing live, by giving their beloved recordings 'a little improvisation' when on stage and the songs sound NOTHING like the studio-recorded version.

As a movie, the animation is a low budget 3D style, but common enough to where if you watch these kinds of movies, you've seen it before. So, that aside, the story is good, and there's action from the beginning to the end. The characters are ok, well represented, the voice work is good (though the animation can make the voice over look bad sometimes). This is pure fantasy, like Xena or Red Sonja, but more with an Asian twist. There are a few gory scenes and blood.

6447097,2,B00KTZAKLU,"Pretty disappointing.  They faithfully brought back Nariko and Kai's character, but not much else.  They are probably the only positives in a sea of negatives.

First, the most important aspect, the story.  The pacing is one note.  If you've ever seen any of Bay's Transformers movies, it's like that, but without the amazing effects by ILM.  Stuff happens on screen, characters say and act out dramatic lines, but nothing really resonates.  Each scene only serves to push out the next plot point without really developing characters or relationships.  A lot of the movie is told through expository narration re-using the same flash animated scenes and assets from 2007 when the game was released.  Oddly, the original flash shorts had a more intriguing story with more meaning than the rewritten narration.

As for the characters that I grew to love in the game... Well, the boss enemies from the game make their appearances, but their personalities have been changed drastically, with the exception of Roach.  Even then, with Roach, the broken relationship between him and his father is never really developed as it is in the original game.  Instead, you get a little bit of a skirmish with Nariko and then the final scene lifted from the game that no longer has the context to make sense.  King Bohan has been stripped of all his charisma and humor that made him the likable yet despicable villain in the game.  I understand wanting to have different takes on characters, but the rewrites and directions just makes the villain bland with little motivation.  In the source material, while his motivations weren't the most complex, they made sense.  He was a greedy bastard that indulged in his basal desires much like a bratty child given an army and power by an ominous raven.  Shen's rewrite treatment really did away with any of his more redeeming qualities and paints him more of a villain capable of rape.  The way he was originally written was as a man conflicted with his duty to his clan and the sword and his love for his daughter.  Originally ashamed of her for being born a girl and almost pushed to the brink of murdering his own daughter after the loss of his wife through child birth and failing the prophecy, he spares her life and turns her into a warrior.  She grows to be respected as a warrior, even if the other clansmen blame her for every misfortune.  Shen had a sense of guilt for putting Nariko through this ordeal and you feel it in the game.  In the movie, he just comes off as a lying bastard.  Kai's relationship and fear of Flying Fox is explained in 1 line of dialogue and is never brought up again, even when he comes and attacks both Kai and Nariko.

Now how about the visuals?  Honestly, they might be reusing the same character models from the PS3 game, but the movie just doesn't look as good as the game running in real time on the PS3.  When you have all the rendering time in the world to render a scene, you should be able to add more detail, higher resolution textures, better lighting, better physics, particle effects, and animation.  Instead, everything looks a bit smeared with a dull color pallet.  The animation is 2nd rate and pales in comparison to the game it's based off of.  The set pieces also all take place in very flat box like environments with low polygon count.  Nothing feels organic.  It feels like a 3D animated movie with the tech limitations from the late 90's.  Ninja Theory, the developers of the original game, were able to make a much more impressive concept trailer on a micro-budget for their upcoming game Hellblade.

Well, how about the action?  The action is slow paced and a bit janky.  It's obvious they used a lot of the animation from the game as reference for the fight sequences, but the combat just doesn't flow in an interesting manner.  It's sad because this is probably where most of the budget was wasted on.  I would have rather had more time actually fleshing out some of the characters and even removing some if necessary to give time to make a meaningful story with maybe 2-3 well done action sequences spread throughout the movie.  Instead you're treated to some pretty generic sequences that are hardly memorable.  It's a shame.

Sadly, the music isn't any better.  The game had an amazing score that I can still remember to this day.  This movie doesn't use any of it and is replaced with forgettable background music.

If you're a fan of the original game, you might want to purchase this just to show Sony that there still is interest in this franchise, but it is not a good movie or faithful adaptation by any stretch of the imagination.  The new plot twists and characters are never fully developed and the personality from the original characters are all but gone save for Nariko and Kai.  I would recommend popping in the old game in instead or finding the cinematics online and watching those instead of watching this movie.  Very, very disappointing.",1411257600,,4950,4.677083333333333
6447098,3,B00KTZAKLU,"If you have ever read a book and then gone to the movie only to be let down by the movie (which happens every time save two), then you know exactly what this movie is.  The story told in the game is the book, so if you have played the game you are going to be let down by this movie.  First off, the animation is decent, but not great.  In a few scenes its noticeably bad, but id bet there wasn't a lot of budget backing this movie.
The story is where the movie really lets you down.  First off you are removing a god of a creator from the film in Andy Serkis.  What he did with the game, both acting and directing, is noticeable here.  You lose that kind of awesomeness and you automatically are losing at least a star and a half, even though i like Alfred Molina.  Every character here came off very flat.  Anna was so fiery in the game, but here its like she's reading assembly instructions for most of the movie.  Kai loses her quirkiness, and the bad guys of the film that had such memorable personalities are completely devoid of any personality what so ever, Boshen especially but then again you ARE losing Andy there so its a no win.
As for the story, it too is very flat and lifeless.  Nariko and her father should have been more at odds from the beginning and Shen's wanting to produce an heir was a joke.  The whole brother story line was a complete waste and only distracted from Nariko's story as it should have been.
In the end, if you haven't played the game then there's a chance you might like this a bit more.  Although even then i don't know if there is enough that is ""special"" in this film to make it really stand out.  If you have played the game chances of you liking this are slim and none.  Either way the best thing you can do to really hear the best story is to just go to YouTube and watch a video that assembles all the game cut scenes into a movie.",1410998400,,1878,4.123626373626373

This version though has cheap graphics, poor story writing, and terrible voice acting in comparison to the original video game.... and believe me I am being nice. Sony has tricked me and ripped me off before, why should this be any different? After my third Ps3 broke down, I stopped buying sony products. Fool me once.... blah blah blah. Still took me three times though before I got it. Just to clarify my PS3 situation, the first one (a day one cecha 01) suffered from the graphic chip failure, the second was the ceche 01 with the cheaply made kes 410 laser unit that fails after about a year of usage. The third was a non backwards compatible cechl 01 that failedafter two yearswhen the display outputs burned out. No parts are interchangeable between these. All of them failed, according to sony, due to manufacturing defects, but all outside of warranty... of course... so it would cost a minimum of $80 just to have them look at it... not fix it.",1410912000,2,1209,4.475113122171946

6447101,4,B00KTZAKLU,"I have not played the game, which may be a good thing when watching films based on the game. I am barely over the shock of that FF VII fiasco, that I hesitated to take on another animated film based on a game.

Nariko along with Kai seek out Loki who they believe is ""The Chosen One"" who can wield the power of the heavenly sword, because it could never be a woman, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. They want to keep the sword out of the hands of the evil King Bohan in what amounts to an oriental Viking tale of the Middle Earth.

Kai has a bad case of Yoda Syntax she does. She ""likes to make blood."" Nariko is ""clearly no kitten."" She has great lines like, ""Let's see you laugh when your guts hit the floor.""

The film has a lot of fighting and killing and is light on plot. Like so many games, the bad guys become more of a challenge as the game goes along and the characters level up.

Some of the fighting sequences were way too lengthy, perhaps because of the game. 3 1/2 stars",1410739200,,977,4.072916666666667
6447102,2,B00KTZAKLU,"So Sony wanted to see if there was a way to use old video game asset to make movies. And this game was the first attempt to do that...

So as long as you have that in mind it make sense why the graphics are well like the ps3 version of the game.why the horses never seem to touch the ground, and why the lip synching always just seems off.

 The voice acting is actually pretty good other then the brother which is horrible. But that said most things they say make no sense. Plan on some really bad writing through out the story. People jump from loving to hating back to loving some really douchy people.

Scene progression makes no sense often assuming we know the back story when certain things happen without any explanation or even a dump line. And I have never played the game so I really don't understand.

All that said, I'm pretty sure the interesting part is from the origanal story from ninja theory but it a interesting take on sexism in a traditional hero story. Truly the best part that sadly completely falls apart through bad writing and terrible direction.

A legend tells of a hero to be born to use the heavenly sword, and when that child is born, it's a surprise a daughter. And cause in all legends woman can't be warriors so the girl takes the sword ironically on an adventure to find her long lost brother for he's a dude and should be able to use the sword. Without giving away too many spoilers I'll just say she weirdly enough seems to do pretty damn good with her sword skills.

If this movie was handled by someone with some actual directing talents maybe it would have been good. It had some of the elements of a fun movie but comes way to short in some of the most important parts.

Worst part is it's not funny bad, it's just confusing and kind of boring. I'm actually writing this review as I'm watching the final boss fight cause I got bored.",1410652800,,1875,4.321937321937322
6447103,3,B00KTZAKLU,"This game deserves a full motion picture, theater release and all. Something more worthy to the game. This great game deserve something more, something better.",1410480000,,159,5.4
6447104,3,B00KTZAKLU,"I'm not an avid gamer so when I read that the movie HEAVENLY SWORD was based on a tremendously successful video game I had to take the producer's word on that. From the look and feel of the movie I can believe that every word of that is true.

The story takes place in the orient where a weapon known as the heavenly sword was used in the far past to bring peace and tranquility to the world. Used to defeat a madman intent on ruling the world, it has been placed in the care of a clan whose sole responsibility is to protect it from the world. Only the chosen one can wield the sword as it drains the life force from anyone who would take possession of if be it for good or for bad.

As time passes the sword is protected by the clan until word reaches them that King Bohan has set his sights on taking the sword so that he can rule the world. Born a prince and treated unmercifully as a child, Bohan killed his father to take the crown and now uses evil magic to work his way across the land, taking it all for himself.

A problem rises in the clan when they can find no chosen one to wield the sword. The ruler of the clan is ashamed because he had a daughter, Nariko, as his first born child rather than a boy. Trained in secret by her mentor and her father's best friend, as Bohan attacks their stronghold Nariko and her best friend Kai must find the chosen one and stop Bohan at all costs.

The duo set out to find this chosen one using what little clues they have. Along their journey they discover so much that they never knew, starting with the fact that they are sisters of the same father. Clues later lead them to find that the king did indeed give birth to a son but he and the child had no idea. This is where they head with the sword, Bohan on their heels trying to put an end to the last remnants of the clan.

This sword and sorcery epic does a good job of telling its tale using computer animated graphics to bring the game to life. The animation here falls in line with what you find these days in games found on Play station 3 or X-Box which can be quite good. But if you enjoy these sorts of stories then you're not overly concerned with that. Instead you're more concerned with the story and here there is plenty of that.

While HEAVENLY SWORD might not be for everyone I have little doubt that gamers will love this movie. Fans of the classic swashbuckling films will find something in it for them as well. As for myself I enjoyed it from start to finish and have found a place for it on the collector's shelf here at home. I have no doubt that from time to time, when the mood strikes me, I'll pull it down from the shelf and enjoy it all over again.",1410393600,,2674,4.103250478011472

This movie made little sense and gives you slight flashbacks of how it felt playing the game. The movie was ""ALL OVER"" the place and never really found it's footing. I felt as if I saw a very long cut scene from the game. Bosses from the game made cameos and were dealt with far too fast.

Render in CG, it captures the feel of the game faithfully, in High Def. All the voice actors are back to reprise their roles! Anna Torv is great as the main heroine, and Alfred Molina is cast as the villain who wants the sword no matter what. From beginning to end, you will enjoy this action packed adventure.
