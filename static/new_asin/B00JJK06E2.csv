6361696,4,B00JJK06E2,"I bought these as an introduction to ashtanga, I've been practicing yoga off and on for a few years.  I love that the practice is broken down into shorter sequences or you have the option of playing them all together.  It's less overwhelming and easier to fit in my schedule.  The tutorial section is handy for alignment and adaptations but doesn't cover enough poses.  Kino's voice sounds kind of like a robot to me as she narrates the practices but overall I'm very happy with these videos.  It's been a manageable way to try a new practice.",1408752000,3,543,4.556701030927835
6361697,5,B00JJK06E2,"There are many ""for beginners"" Yoga DVD's available.  (I own many of them!)  But what Kino MacGregor presents in this DVD is something quite a bit more specific and deliberate.  This DVD introduces you to a specific system of yoga known as Ashtanga.  And it does so, in the traditional manner, via the sun salutations.

Which DVD is best for which individual may be subjective.  But I feel confident in saying that, for any individual who wants a sound and authentic introduction to the system of yoga known as Ashtanga, this is the best place to begin.  The DVD includes a general tutorial for total beginners, three practices, two additional ""workshops"" / practices, an interview with Kino, and an inspirational demonstration by Kino.

The first practice is essentially 5x sun salutation A, with a nice warm-up period and three closing poses. The second practice builds on this by removing the initial warm-up, quickening the pace, and adding 5x sun salutation B.  The third practice incorporates some standing poses.  There is an excellent workshop on core strength - it will work shoulders and legs as well - and I find these exercises are carefully chosen to prepare the student for some of the demands to come.  There is also a relaxation workshop which I've not yet tried.

Kino does not necessarily possess the smooth television presence of, for example, Rodney Yee.  But she more than makes up for this with her precise, clear instruction.  Her personal experience and her understanding of anatomy allow her to deliver very specific tips and guidance that anyone - beginner or expert - would find valuable.  She also has a great volume of material provided for free on her youtube channel, which is how I discovered her originally.  Check that out and see if you're as impressed with her clarity as I was.",1407110400,78,1814,4.859934853420196
6361698,5,B00JJK06E2,"I put this dvd in yesterday for the first time, I have to say I really like it. I did yoga in college -about 7 years ago now - and have an off and on love affair with it. Recently it's been off, so I needed something to get back on that wasn't going to kill me since my activity level has been nonexistent. This is a very good beginners dvd if you follow her instructions. What I mean by this is - if you don't know what you are doing, go to the tuturial or instructions on the dvd, they will help, then do the 20 minutes of sun salutations until you have them down and can participate the full way through before moving on to the next segment, and so on. Move slowly until you can handle more of a challenge.

Ms. MacGregor is calming to listen to, keeping the same tones throughout to keep you aware of what you are doing as you move, She is not super fast paced in this which is good for me as asthma is not my friend. She does talk very fast though, but it's not super hard to follow.

I have done dvd's in the past and find that I hate the people in them. All their excitement or vigor with their forced slow talking ""depth"" I find irritating. I mostly follow books, set my own pace, and listen to whatever music I feel like, because the DVD's or youtube videos are either too fast paced for me to follow or still to challenging for my very weak and inflexible self. I really do like this though. It's challenging without taking you out, it's easy to follow along without losing control of your breath and you get plenty of options for those who just can't move themselves in that posture yet. It's a good buy.",1406160000,47,1615,4.123809523809523
6361699,5,B00JJK06E2,"I just bought this DVD and I absolutely adore it. There are six classes, including the tutorial and relaxation portion, and all are less than 25 minutes each. You can play them all as one long class, or you can do them separately if you are short on time. Each one on its own will give you a great workout. The tutorial portion describes some of the foundational poses in very clear detail and will help beginners figure out how to protect themselves from injury during the practice. I do wish she went in to detail about Downward Facing Dog pose, but she hits on all the other important ones. The relaxation and meditation portion is fantastic. Too many yoga videos just leave the practitioner to their own devices and, especially where beginners are concerned, this is a huge mistake. Kino makes it possible for you to take full advantage of this 10 minute portion of her dvd. She doesn't just leave you lying on your back wondering what you're supposed to be doing - she actually guides you through a restorative routine and tells you what your body and mind are meant to be doing in order to fully relax.
This DVD is a great challenge for a true beginner. Kino is very conscientious about making sure to describe how to keep your spine safe in all the postures, so even someone with absolutely no experience could do these routines. It is also an excellent refresher for people who have been practicing for a long time. As a 10+ year practitioner of Vinyasa and Classical Yoga, I still learned a lot about the postures from Kino's monologues in this video. Every style teaches the postures a little differently, and it was fascinating to learn Ashtanga's perspective on poses I've been doing for years.
One thing I should note - Kino does not stop talking. She is constantly and rhythmically telling you what to do with your body, how to properly align yourself in each posture, and how to protect yourself from injury in each pose. She also consistently guides you as to how you should be breathing with each movement. I find this extremely helpful, and the sound of her voice eventually becomes meditative as you follow along more and more. I know some people might be put off by this, however, so I felt it was worth mentioning. As I said, I happen to love this about her videos. It's so difficult to tell one's students everything they should know about a posture as you guide them in class, but Kino succeeds in getting out the most important information in the most clear and concise way possible. The ever present sound of her voice helps to keep you focused on the moment and helps you remain mindful of what your body is doing.
As for the production value, the camera angles are good, scenery is pretty, and the music (which you can turn on and off) isn't offensive or distracting. All in all, this is an excellent Yoga DVD, and I would recommend it for all levels of practitioners.",1405900800,95,2895,4.5585412667946255
6361700,4,B00JJK06E2,"It's a great dvd and yoga routine. The downside to it that it should be labeled as a beginner Ashtanga dvd and not Yoga for Beginners. It would be a great dvd for someone who already has some strength, flexibility,  and knowledge of yoga.",1405123200,23,238,4.409090909090909
6361721,4,B00JJK06E2,"Updated review:  I still prefer Kundalini style yoga, but after giving this DVD a couple of more tries I am upgrading the rating to 4 stars.  The core workout is INTENSE and after only 3x doing the core practice, my lower abs are stronger.  The practice flow is similar to Bryan Kests Power Yoga but I believe Kino moves more quickly.  I worked up a good sweat doing Practice #3 and then followed with the core practice.  Kino is much younger and stronger than I am (I am 54!) but I am going to keep at it and see what I can achieve!",1483315200,4,533,4.135922330097087

Would not recommend to those using yoga as a way to be relax.",1482278400,2,358,4.4393939393939394
6361723,1,B00JJK06E2,"I am sure for people who may be a bit flexible, this video is doable...but for beginners, no way! I don't know why some people say that this video or even why she says this video is for beginners at all levels, it clearly is not. You will find yourself over your headin a mater of a couple of moves. I'm guessing she meant people who are normally a bit flexible already, but have no yoga experience. But if you have flexibility problems or are really tight, have never done yoga before, and looking for something reasonable and doable, sadly, this is not it. I would say, after you have done a real easy beginner routine, THEN this would probably be something in the way of a next step up.",1480723200,,689,4.3076923076923075
6361724,5,B00JJK06E2,I love this DVD! I've bought multiple Ashtanga dvds and have struggled to find one that teaches the poses at a slower pace at first.

By the end I felt confident enough to move in a flow with her practices.,1478304000,5,356,4.409090909090909
6361725,3,B00JJK06E2,"I do yoga for the peace and thoughtful practice of balancing my thoughts that are usually everywhere after my stressful day job.  I found the speed of narration very stressful, and commanding instruction too much for me.  I know she is a master at yoga, as I watched the extra, with Kino showing how she is able to do all the most challenging asanas.  I am not into yoga just to increase my power and master asanas, but to become a more thoughtful, compassionate being.  This is not my particular style.",1474588800,2,503,4.4945054945054945

I'm not exactly a beginner in Ashtanga. I'm on year 3+ of Ashtanga and have been working so very hard at it but you find out so much about the fundamentals and foundations that Kino covers here well. The MAIN reason I got this video, however is because of the 20-minute core work that Kino does and if you do them every day, you will build a core so strong that those Ashtanga transition that seem impossible will then become possible. I attached a short clip of doing assisted press-ups with the Dharma Yoga Wheel right after finishing the core exercises in this video, and this is something I'd not have been able to do before the core work. I'm already seeing amazing progress after just 1 week of doing these core exercises.

The rest of the video is also very good. I did the entire 2 hours yesterday just for fun. It's a tutorial at first followed by 3 short practices. So in essence, I did a ton of Surya Namaskar A and B which was fun. I love the inspiration that Kino offers and if you really listen to what she says, she has a lot to teach. I used to dismiss some of her teachings and just want to get the ""secret"" to doing this and that, but when I really started to listen, I realized how crucial it is to emphasize on building up the core and since I started doing that, I'm seeing amazing progress. So for that alone, this DVD is worth it a hundred times over.

I watched it using Amazon Video streaming option on my phone, even though I bought it (not rented it). love that option as I don't have a DVD player so I could just stream it from my iPhone 6S plus! Excellent option for Amazon to have for us here.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who wants to build strength with confidence and also learn some Ashtanga!",1468540800,17,2115,5.12463768115942

6361778,1,B00JJK06E2,"This is my 1st truly terrible review I have had to write. I cannot give this 0 stars so 1 will have to do. Let me preface this review by saying I had long admired Kino. She is crazy talented as far as balance, inversions, and flexibility. I would look at her instagram pics and videos and be in awe at her abilities. I ordered the ""beginner"" so my husband would be able to do this with me. Lets just say it was an epic fail...just like this video.

1st this is NOT a beginner dvd. Kino uses pretty advanced cues that even had a seasoned yogi saying whaaaaaat?

2nd she doesn't stop talking. It's like she couldn't let there be silence for a moment. She over-did it in that department and that's super annoying.

3rd it's voice over so don't expect anything else.

4th She is monotone and that equals boring. Having a teacher with the ability to NOT make you want to get up and leave is very important. I made it through Surya Namaskar A and had to turn it off. That's pretty bad...

5th I can't believe there's more..... there is NOTHING I liked about this dvd. Nothing. Just because you are good at something doesn't mean you will be a good teacher.

I was extremely let down. I know she will be in San Antonio soon and after this...I will not spend my money to take her class. In fact she owes me a refund i think. This was a complete waste of $.",1439856000,8,1348,4.185328185328185

Yes, there are other much easier dvd's for beginners, but this is Ashtanga yoga. So as a help in beginning the practice, along with a Mysore practice under the guidance of an authorized or at least an experienced teacher, this will fill that need. If you want a slow, meditative type of yoga introduction, you may want to look elsewhere. I would also recommend Kino's  ""Introduction to Ashtanga"" dvd, for a good introduction to breathing and history. Her book on the Primary series, is an excellent resource, too.",1438992000,,616,4.980582524271845

6361798,5,B00JJK06E2,"I have a review on here of a Yoga for athletes DVD. I grew up a football, baseball and basketball player. Both football and baseball all the way through college.  We're both nearing 40 and she had a belief that Yoga was just for flexible people and thought it was boring/slow. I did okay with the Yoga for athletes and gained some old flexibility back in my legs. So she wanted to try Yoga herself. I directed her to this video since I've seen Kino's videos on youtube. First a problem. Wife was not happy about my choice. She instantly said, ""OMG"" yes, she said the acronym instead of the words and, ""You picked this one because you think she's hot"". All joking aside, guys should probably stick to the one for athletes or one being instructed by a man since your wife/girlfriend might not take too kindly to you watching Kino.

After two weeks my wife admitted she was feeling more limber especially in her legs and lower back. She does this routine roughly 3 times a week and then alternates it with a higher impact aerobic DVD 3 times a week. My own advice is to be patient with these Yoga DVDs. That could be a negative with Kino as well. She goes through the motions without a hitch. Making it look almost easy. I would compare that to some local college football players I work with. They want to be able to jump right in the weight room and stack the bench press with 410 pounds. That's the patience I believe is required. Start out slow and work your way into this workout. Any working out is better than none so look at it that way when you're frustrated with not being able to do what the instructor does. You'll get there eventually or at least you'll eventually be closer to getting there than you was before you started.",1431561600,10,1734,4.381987577639752
6361799,5,B00JJK06E2,"I love this practice. Although I have done yoga in the past, it had been some time since I put myself on the mat. First step give myself a talkin' to... Second treat my self as a beginner, I've always loved yoga, but would get to that feeling good with the practice point and fall into my superwomen mindset and oooppps, twang goes the hamstring or aarrgh goes the groin.  Then having to sit out the next month in repair mode. But, alas with age comes wisdom... I did Kino's tutorial and meditation for two weeks, then added practice 1 for two weeks... Dropped the tutorial and performed practice 1&2 for a month... Added practice 3 for two months. Now I'm in the flow... Dropped practice 1 doing 2&3 for a week added the core exercises and i will continue this routine until I reach perfection...i plan to practice this routine for at least a year, tweaking here and there. also I do practice the meditation on a daily basis.
I plan on being a student of yoga for the rest of my days of which I hope to have many!  At this time Kino's style and guidance suites me well. I feel my body getting stronger and taller every day.
Whoever you choose to practice with, respect your body, listen to it, just because you stretched this far yesterday doesn't mean you'll have the same stretch tomorrow, be gentle with yourself. I figure I'll always be a beginner, leaving some practice behind as I start new.

but I find it VERY helpful. I want someone to remind me of the alignment I need to be in to not injure myself. Thank You Kino for who u r and everything you do!!",1427068800,10,592,3.782258064516129
6361817,1,B00JJK06E2,"Not relaxing, she talks was too fast, she moves way too fast through the breaths, and I get an overall conceit and insincerity, the music is terrible, she gives no modifications which ashtanga doesn't usually have anyway.  Will sell online huge disappointment.",1427068800,6,260,5.190476190476191

6361820,5,B00JJK06E2,"This dvd is great. I absolutely love Kino and she makes it extremely easy for beginners to really learn these poses by breaking them down, unlike a lot of other yoga instruction dvds. I am feeling much more confident and balanced in daily life as a direct result. I would highly recommend this DVD to anybody who is interested in beginning ashtanga yoga!",1424390400,4,354,4.634920634920635

6361832,1,B00JJK06E2,This is for beginner's?? Come on!  Been wanting to try yoga for some time and thought this would be a good dvd to start with. I was wrong. Makes me not even want to try another 'beginner' dvd. Instructor talks way to fast. I understand that the female teacher probably has been doing this for years .... and it shows ... but to show all those advanced positions in a beginner's dvd doesnt give much encouragement to the true 'beginner'. Waste of money.,1423353600,6,452,4.445783132530121
6361833,5,B00JJK06E2,"There are some moves that are beyond beginners, but she shows you how to modify them if you are not flexible. She also has a section where she has basic instruction for the main moves and is easy to follow along.",1422489600,,212,4.195121951219512

6361836,4,B00JJK06E2,"I'll be honest in my rating in saying that I have only tried the first two sessions. I will update with another review after going through the whole series. So far it is a bit slow and redundant for me which has made it mentally challenging to keep with it for me, personally. I think I was looking for a bit more challenge. True to it's title, it probably is really perfect for the beginner who has never practiced any form of yoga previously. I would like the sessions to build a bit more than they do. The progression is really slow...again good for beginners. I really like Kino's style as an instructor so I'll have to try one of her more advanced DVDs.",1420070400,2,658,4.314516129032258
6361837,5,B00JJK06E2,"I love this DVD. It's wonderful for beginners who want to specifically becin the Ashtanga yoga. Where I live, yoga is more aabout just stretching and relaxing. The Ashtanga yoga method is also about getting stronger and deeper into the practice. Kino really makes an effort to make you understand that. She also tells you WHEN you are a beginner and when you are more advanced, which I find really useful and important to improve and advance into the yoga experience.
This DVD is about the foundations. A strong foundation leads to strong basics and make the advanced postures safe. While it's still challenging, it's quite nice for an absolute beginner. Kino always tells you where you should be feeling pressure and relax in your body, so that you can move into the postures the correct and safe way. This way you can get all the benefits of the postures whithout being dangerous or too challenging. You can get the maximum benefit of the postures, and with time, improve your flexibility and strenght.
The interview part is REALLY interesting. It's not only about Kino herself, you MUST watch the interview. You might have some questions that you didin't know you were asking! She speaks about her diet, yoga journey and gives some information about the spiritual aspects of the practice.
The DVD itself is also really nicely recorded, with beautiful backgrounds and high quality image. You can also remove the music or the vocal instructions, to practice silently.
I can't wait to improve my level into the practice to buy her intermediate DVD. Kino is a wonderful teacher and a wonderful woman!",1419724800,5,1599,4.882352941176471
6361838,4,B00JJK06E2,"Great DVD.  My only criticism is that there are no closed captions.  As a hearing impaired person, I was really disappointed.  Other wise a great DVD.",1418947200,,150,4.6923076923076925
6361839,4,B00JJK06E2,"She is awesome in this video, as she breaks down the primary series. This is great if you're a beginner or just getting back into yoga. She helps with your breathing and each asana. I highly recommend!",1418169600,,201,4.45945945945946

6361842,4,B00JJK06E2,"I agree with the other reviews who point out the video is aptly named ""Ashtanga Yoga"" this is not for ""yoga beginners."" How much do you need to be able to do? At least a full lotus pose. oops. I mean there's no alternative provided and no prep - it's just part of the program. She slides into one so quickly and lithely. If you need a minute to fold up, you're no longer in sync.

BUT you know what I love about this Ashtanga video? That it's for beginners. None of the other ""beginner"" Ashtanga yoga videos I've purchased or viewed were anything but the primary series. This is mos def NOT the primary sequence. These are three roughly 20 minute practices designed to build strength and tap into the mind space necessary for this style of yoga. Kino does provide a steady flow of subtle direction which vastly improved my body knowledge and understanding of the sequence.

She is truly a gifted teacher. Check out her video shorts on YouTube first and see if you don't agree. You'll either really appreciate the chatter or find it distracting. I find it spot on.",1416614400,10,1063,4.474226804123711
6361843,5,B00JJK06E2,"Excellent course. Kino teaches with so many cues, which is oddly a special thing for a yoga teacher.

6361845,5,B00JJK06E2,"As a beginner to the Ashtanga style of yoga, I find this dvd to be an amazing and helpful series of progressive practices to help the new yogi develop more strength and flexibility. You work on a really solid foundation as you move towards eventually being able to do the full practice in the primary series (which to be clear, is not in this dvd). Each of the 3 practices includes more of the asanas from the beginning of the primary series than the practice before.",1412553600,5,467,4.441860465116279

6361848,1,B00JJK06E2,"This was really disappointing. The first two ""series"" are vinyasas and they are both pretty much the same. The third series is both the vinyasas combined with the standing postures. When I thought Ashtanga Yoga For Beginners (I've done a lot of yoga but I would consider myself an Ashtanga beginner), this is definitely not at all what I had in mind. I will be returning it, unfortunately. Also, my husband and I both agreed that Kino talks very fast and it's not really relaxing or meditative at all. It was just frustrating.",1410912000,12,526,4.666666666666667

8651293,3,B00JJK06E2,"This is just ok for me. I like videos that have shorter practices for days I don't have a lot of time. However, the short segments are not complete. Each one focuses on one thing. So, the first practice is 20+ minutes of the first sun salutation. I guess that is ok, but kind of limiting. The third practice finally gets to things beyond the different sun salutations (triangle pose) but you barely spend a breath in each posture. I have another Ashtanga video that allows more time in each pose. I like to have some ""flow"" but not a race.",1532995200,,539,4.346534653465347

There is no rush in yoga, but prepare to stay a month or so mastering each segment. I also like Kinos down to earth vibe, however I'd like to know/learn the names of each pose that I'm competing. This video will definitely prepare you to stay in downward dog for a looooong time.",1528934400,,429,4.0588235294117645

I see reviews here complain its only sun salutations but this is where you're supposed to start in this type of yoga to build up your strength to the more difficult poses.  I always thought I would get bored doing the same thing every day but I've been doing this for over a month, 6 days a week and I'm not bored at all!
Thank you Kino for this wonderful teaching!",1526342400,,492,4.178947368421053

But as I am out of shape.. even the first practice (basic Sun Salutation, & lotus positions) was unattainable. Years ago I practiced Yoga ( not Astanga) - and was more flexible. I know its a personal journey.  I would not recommend this for true beginners or out of shape beginners.",1515110400,2,407,4.8
8651298,1,B00JJK06E2,"As a beginner, I found this DVD was way too hard to follow.  The concepts were not explained well.  This is for those who are familiar with yoga but want to begin their work in Ashtanga.  This DVD is not for true beginners.",1514851200,,223,4.1395348837209305
8651299,5,B00JJK06E2,GREAT video! Very informative and definitely a need for every ashtanga beginner. I originally gave it 4 starts but went with a 5 in the end bc theyres really nothing wrong with it..i just made the mistake amd assumed it was a video for primary series. Kino is great.

8651302,5,B00JJK06E2,"1. Kino always talks fast; you will see a few 1-star reviews about how fast she talks and constantly talking. If you ever watch her YouTube videos you will know that is just how she is and very knowledgeable in what she does.

2. The pace is fast but it's a DVD people. You need to slow down or work on something, the control is in your hands: it's called a remote.

3. Many of the moves and positions are very challenging BUT that isn't her, that is Ashtanga. If that is too much for you look into Hatha or Vinyasa which are gentler approaches. Ashtanga is more strength oriented than anything else.

4. She does talk so much you will have to look here and there to make sure you are doing what she is. But after you do that a few times you will be able to follow along and if you memorize it, just do it on your own without the DVD.

5. It takes time. It's no different than any other physical activity. You need to go at your own pace for only you know what you can and cannot do.

In short, this is one of my favorite DVD's. I am currently focusing only on this DVD unless my body needs a break to which I am known to switch to one of my Hatha DVD's. Either way, it's well worth having.

P.S.
Blocks and Yoga straps help.",1485129600,3,1225,4.020576131687243
