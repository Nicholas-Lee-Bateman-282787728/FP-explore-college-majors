8200793,5,B000A7IH3K,"If you like the Beach Boys and you're also a country music fan this
is an absolute MUST! After many years they got together again in Nashville
and accompanied by the greatest country stars and country legends, they
all sang together their greatest hits. The country stars sang their
hearts out while the Beach Boys did the vocal harmonies better than ever.
The result is a fantastic gathering! To listen to these # 1 Beach Boys
hits with a country flavored style is a complete knock-out and of
course it's all ""live"". The sound quality is superb. There's only one
sad situation here: both Carl Wilson and Tammy Wynette, who are so
wonderful here chatting and singing, would die a couple of months after
this reunion. It probably was their last appearance. Special attention
for Willie Nelson, Junior Brown, Lorrie Morgan (wonderful!), Toby Keith,
Collin Ray and last but not least a very pretty Kathy Troccoli. All in
all one of the best musical DVD's to get",1217808000,5,958,4.74251497005988
