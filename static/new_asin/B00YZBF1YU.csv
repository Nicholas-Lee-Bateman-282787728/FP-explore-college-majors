7269588,5,B00YZBF1YU,WoW--More like 7.7! BUCK BUCK!,1438128000,,30,5.2
7269589,5,B00YZBF1YU,"Truly surprised by this Creature Horror film. The Casting was brilliantly done, the acting and character development was intelligently thought out and executed. The story line and flow was near perfect.  I have watched hundreds of movies from this Genre and I must say this is well worth the watch. I was expecting a 3 star possibly 3 1/2 horror film and got much more than that. The Story line was sealed tight, original with true logical flow, never rolled my eyes once. YES there was great suspense build and a def. creep factor, music really set the tone here. If you really want a great scary\ creepy twitch fest then this is a must see. I rank it up in my top 10 Creature Horror and I have seen many ;)",1438128000,,708,4.363636363636363
7269590,5,B00YZBF1YU,"I love horror movies but I hate BAD movies.  I saw the ratings and assumed they were made by the director's wife and family- 5 stars really???  It's rating is ""NR"" and it stars that jerk from Lost!  No way.  So glad I took a chance on it.  Loved it!  Not big budget and yes not spent on special effects (or screaming co-eds in push-up bras).  Just good writing (I can't believe I just typed that), great acting and a smoldering, tense atmosphere that I think comes through in the end.  The tension builds through what others consider slow parts.  Kevin Durand was amazing.  Wow.  I don't know where this was hiding but thank you Amazon viewers for your ratings because without them I would have missed this little gem.",1438041600,,718,4.446153846153846
7269591,3,B00YZBF1YU,"Loosely based on a Native American legend of the Wendigo. ""A Wendigo (also known as windigo, weendigo, windago, windiga, witiko, wihtikow, and numerous other variants including manaha) is a half-beast creature appearing in the legends of the Algonquian peoples along the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes Region of both the United States and Canada. The creature or spirit could either possess characteristics of a human or a monster that had physically transformed from a person. It is particularly associated with cannibalism"", (Wikipedia).

A little slow, but not too bad.",1437782400,,572,5.426966292134831
7269592,5,B00YZBF1YU,"The robust rating is all due to Kevin Durand and the supporting actors. The setting and plots are really nothing new. But each character was worth rooting for in their own right. Ive never been a fan of any horror movie. This is minimal gore. It plays out like a good old fashioned scary story for around the campfire. Watch it, if for nothing else, to appreciate the acting of these relatively unknown players.",1437782400,21,411,4.5675675675675675
7269593,3,B00YZBF1YU,"A small town sheriff (Kevin Durand)  and his deputy (Lucas Haas) start finding strange animal tracks in the snow and all over town. Livestock and other animals start turning up dead and mutilated. Men also go missing and are eventually found with their torsos in trees and some other body parts below.

The first hour or so are somewhat slow as they  build character development and tension. But the last 30 or so minutes are tense,scary and totally make up for the slow start. We don't get to see the creature until the end of the movie except for it's shape reflected in a window or see his shadow. Which I feel is more effective because sometime when you see a creature too much you become desensitized to it.

The creature is pretty cool looking and well done. There's violence that consists of some blood splatter, vague shots of body parts and mutilated animals. But not much more. It's an entertaining creature feature with beautiful cinematography of a small town that a snowy winter has descended  upon. The acting is one of the film's biggest strengths but it lacks the gore we love in this genre.",1437696000,,1107,4.627551020408164
7269594,5,B00YZBF1YU,"Just what I wanted this movie to be.....didn't want it to end but when it did....my oh my I'm like the other reviewer - those last 20 seconds were everything I wanted and so much more!  Great story, builds and builds and builds and ka-boom....explodes!  Don't miss this one - you'll enjoy!",1437696000,,289,4.538461538461538
7269595,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Overall i would reccomend this movie. It has a couple of typical plot points for a B-rated horror, but anymore most anything is a ""typical"" plot point. Even then it's not done exactly the same. Story was decent, for me the best part was the last 20 seconds of the movie. I'm sure there will be people to disagree, but it gives you a ending you weren't expecting halfway through the movie.",1437696000,12,388,4.402777777777778

7269597,5,B00YZBF1YU,"This movie is very good. Lukas Haas also stars. Lukas Haas and Kevin Durand are excellent in this film. Even though it may be listed as a horror film; there really isn't much horror in it. The story is set in a very small NY state town and Kevin is the Sheriff and Lukas is the Deputy. There are some log men killed many miles north of their town and suddenly there are no wild animals in their town, even large flocks of birds leave. The acting by all of the cast is good; nothing stupid in the film. It shows the family interests of the sheriff and a budding romance with the deputy. I am very pleased with this film. There is actually a small amount of bloodshed in the beginning. There are strange unknown creatures causing the problems. I have watched this film at least 6 times!",1518825600,,784,4.268456375838926

Whenever it's available in Amazon Video or on Netflix I make sure to keep it in my queue, I asked for it for Christmas a couple years ago and so I have a DVD, and I even bought the instant version on Amazon so that I can watch it anywhere even when it ISN'T available on Netflix.",1512345600,,422,4.329113924050633

7269604,2,B00YZBF1YU,"Loggers stir up trouble, sending displaced monsters towards Maiden Woods, a tiny town in the middle of nowhere.  They tease the locals with fleeting glimpses.  They make noises in the night.  Pets go missing.  And
Suddenly its a Lifetime movie of the week, concerning the death of a child and a mournful father feeling the guilt.  Hes bleak.  Hes depressed.  He walks around, going through the motions, doing his duty, grieving every step of the way.  His wife suffers.  Their small son suffers.  Their world is blue-gray-dismal.  People feel there should be a limit to mourning and tell him so.  Hes the sheriff for pity sake, snap out of it!  Meanwhile, hunters disappear, birds fly by, a vain attempt is made to harken back to the monsters but its too little and too late.  Worse.  They tack on a clich ending too often used.  There is no impact.  The monsters are given very little screen time.  This was a big disappointment.

This almost constitutes fraud, pretending to be a horror movie when its mostly a family melodramaand even that is a clich.",1508544000,3,1054,4.6923076923076925
7269605,5,B00YZBF1YU,"Absolutely the greatest!  First thought it was kinda slow, but very suspensful.  An 'old fashion' great movie , doesnt rely on special effects or gore , noticed most movies do now  a days 4 lack of plot . No sex scenes 2 get the r rating .  I was very pleased. Ill be watching it again and again.",1507420800,,296,4.051724137931035
7269606,2,B00YZBF1YU,"Come on...I mean...really? Who the heck is paying to give this a good review?  While the acting is good, the story and development is so dumb.  There is no point as to why the creature is there and the way it stalks and doesn't really kill is just plain dumb.  The execution of this film is not well thought out and it is more like a drama with some cool scenery rather than anything close to a horror movie.  Watch this as a very safe ""horror"" movie with someone that may not truly love horror.",1501200000,,495,4.178947368421053

7269612,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Yeah, I liked it.  As monster movies go this one was pretty good.  Some dry spots, i.e., no action just dialog but at least this wasn't one of those sorry I bought it kind of movies. Nice to see Kevin Durand play a good guy for a change and show a different side to his acting repertoire.",1496361600,,288,4.035087719298246
7269613,3,B00YZBF1YU,"I'm a big fan of Kevin Durand, but I really didn't like this movie, could have been a lot better. Outlander with Jim Caviezel is much better. Hope this helps !",1495411200,,159,4.161290322580645
7269614,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Well, let me tell you how suspenseful this movie was. Kevin Durand as the seriously emotionally wounded sheriff is very good. Lukas Haas as his deputy is outstanding too. I have to say that the performances in this movie was outstanding. The story and the direction in this movie was terrific and it has been quite a while since I have seen this level of suspense. I am not sure how I would classify this movie but I will go with horror and suspense. I did not see the ending coming. This is also a cautionary tale of what could be. Would I recommend this movie....I sure would. The story is terrific too so even if you aren't a horror fan.....you will se the very good story.",1495411200,4,676,4.330708661417323
7269615,4,B00YZBF1YU,"The fear factor reminded me of the original ""Wolfman"" back in the '40's .Small town and the locals talking about some mysterious creature living in the woods. Great build up. The scenery and acting were effectively good as well as the personal issues that were going on with the characters and just when you thought the movie was ending on a bit of a downslide (((BAM))) they hit you with a great ending.",1494720000,,404,4.5479452054794525
7269616,3,B00YZBF1YU,good overall,1493596800,,12,5.5
7269617,3,B00YZBF1YU,"I find it interesting how Canada has really embraced the whole horror / sci-fi genre and tried to make it their own in a grand attempt at claiming a cultural identity they don't realize they already have. I should say their artistic establishment doesn't realize it already has. It would help if their artistic establishment wasn't seemingly run by loopy bitter Margaret Atwood. It's still a benefit for us and probably mostly just the product of being stuck inside due to bad weather 9 months out of the year. I get they're tough people but that cold sucks.

In this movie, Kevin Durand plays a sad sack sheriff with a guilt complex from a dead child and a marriage on the rocks. It's all pretty standard drama stuff. He then starts having to deal with various local disturbances caused by a large angry monster. It adds more drama.

The movie is interesting in that it looks and behaves mostly like a gore filled version of a movie like Valley of the Gwangi where a cowboy fights a dinosaur and romances a local farmer daughter. Sure, it's got gore but it's also got a sort of goofball 1950s sensibility to it. A sensibility it tries really hard to undermine. It leads to some awkward moments that don't quite work. They also happen mostly toward the end. Before that though, it's a good throwback film landing like I said somewhere between a movie your mother could love and a 80s monster film. Most of the goodwill comes from Kevin Durand too. At some point, movie producers are going to figure out he's a thing and probably over expose him. He's a lot like Eric Bana or The Rock/Dwayne Johnson. He can be funny but he's so big and tough looking that he seems like he should be doing lots of leading man roles. He does leading man here but it's nuanced and not just by the numbers in a role written rather by the numbers. He's a sad guy but a believable sad. No over the top crying or anything else.

It's not the best movie. It's not worst. It's a good time filler. I was satisfied enough at the end to feel like my day wasn't wasted. It's an accomplishment on a small budget and Canadian accents.",1493424000,,2102,4.4404145077720205
7269618,4,B00YZBF1YU,"5 star horror movie and drama, with a 2 star ending.  Easily the best horror film of 2015 including acting, creature effects, story, etc...  Some people may love the end. I did not.  The depth of the story and heartbreak, and dialogue takes this film miles above other horror films in terms of quality. Tense, devastating, heartbreaking, creepy and scary at times, this film is brilliant for 99.5 percent of its running time. Despite my issues with the conclusion, you should give it a look. Excellent acting from Durand, Haas, and the whole cast.",1493337600,,547,4.797872340425532

Opening scene when the guy gets it, then monster creeping around town, which sheriff has a hard time believing until near the end. The end was twisted! Monster fairly well done and build up of suspense. Nice character development and underlying story line to add human interest. Acting was pretty good.

7269631,4,B00YZBF1YU,"This film was way better than expected. The filter used to film this movie set a tone that matched the suspense perfectly. The setting was beautiful and played its own part and set a wicked ambiance for this movie. More than just a ""monster flick"" this film tells a really good story and is highly under-rated. Why not give it five stars? Well, it is really good, but just about 15 minutes too long. However, that extra length leads to a reveal/swerve that is really interesting and makes you wonder, ""What comes next?"" Durand kills it in his portrayal and he deserves all the credit in the world for moving this film along. Never tired, never dull, I am left with wanting to know more about so many characters (the deputy, the towns-folk, so many good people). I want to see where this story goes, too bad it is unlikely that I (or any other viewer) will get any long-term resolution. Anyway, this part of the story is a fun, emotional, cryptic, dark ride. Loved it!",1479945600,,967,4.5

Kevin Durand stars as the troubled sheriff and leader of the community aided by his NYC refugee deputy, played by Lukas Haas. This has elements of several 1950s monster movies and a good thriller.

Although the special effects are limited, they aren't horrible. Where the f.x might let it down, the casting department definitely went above and beyond. Kevin Durand puts in a wonderful performance.

7269639,5,B00YZBF1YU,"Saw ""for free"" at Netflix.  Going with five stars even though it was low budget and had a few flaws.  It grabs ya, and bonus: there's a minimum of ""why is that person being so stupid?"" moments.  The scare is therefore pure -- not sullied with side-hatred for a illogical-character being a source of frustration in the viewer's nervous system.  None also of the typical monster movie cheap shot of getting us to like a character in order to then kill that character.

Actually this is a soap-opera type tale with relationships and all the problems of being human explored -- well written and acted.

Got to give the directer a slow-clap for not pissing me off in the middle of scaring me.  Well done!

7-28l-17 2nd viewing was interesting in that I got to see what parts of this film ""stuck"" in memory.  A lot of it ""came back to me"" in an instant as each new scene was started, but I just didn't care and I unashamedly confess I had to hit the pause butt more times than I would willingly enter into the historical record.  It's just that good.  I'm easily spooked by this kind of film and this one is such a prime example of how to do it well.  Next viewing would be best done a year from now so as to freshen it as much as possible -- worth the wait for a film that works this nicely upon all that I want nicely worked.",1471651200,,1321,4.219123505976095
7269640,5,B00YZBF1YU,I enjoyed this film very much. I thought the story was well written and the back stories of the characters was compelling enough to make me sympathetic and want them to live to the end of the film. So often in horror films this is not the case and you can't wait for the creature to mangle them. Kevin Durand is a favorite actor of mine and did a great job as did Lukas Haas. Lots of suspense and creepy moments even though what you see is fleeting till near the end. Still what you hear in the forest in the dead of night kept me edgy.

This is a horror movie based in a cold woodsie setting.

7269665,3,B00YZBF1YU,The Movie very was boring!,1458086400,,26,4.4
7269666,3,B00YZBF1YU,"The preamble opens as all motivated monster flicks should, with a bloody outline to the beastly subject of the film. We then head to the pastoral and picturesque Maiden Woods where Sherriff Paul Shields (Kevin Durand) and his second-in-command Donny (Lukas Haas) are mulling over a lost horse situation, the first of what transpires to be many incidents caused by the impish beast. For a low-budget horror film, there is actually a welcome focus to characterisation as we learn that both Paul and Donny are battling inner demons. Paul is dealing with the loss of his infant child that he blames upon himself, while Donny has moved from upstate New York after feeling responsible for the death of his partner. The fact that it is their duty, to protect the small town community from the evil threat, just adds to their woes.

Monster Hunter still eventually feels like a standard horror film. An isolated small town community ends up reliant on a stoic hero to banish the threat. This is not exactly unique stuff. Kevin Durand of the stoic cop trying to his job. There are clichs with countless glimpses and youll miss it shots of the beast (no doubt due to budget limitations) and there is even an its in the house scene thrown in for good measure.

The movie is not without its merits. One interesting, thematic characteristic of the narrative is the presence of an encompassing religious subtext. Sherriff Paul Shields at first seems cynical with the concept of religion as he talks with the towns pastor early in the film, but by the stories climax the whole town is taking literal and symbolic refuge in the church. There is no mistaking the satanic iconography of the beast with its biped hoofs. Perhaps the film is a metaphorical statement on the threat of godlessness in small town America.

Monster Hunter also executes a foreboding suspense in an effectual manner, with its cumbersome score. Considering all things, Monster Hunter does not quite do enough innovative to break free from its budgetary and generic constraints. The whole plot is tight though, and it may just might worth a watch for the slightly unconventional finale.",1457740800,,2141,4.86027397260274

Most the time when main characters are having marital problems, one of them is a jerk, but amazingly, this movie didn't rely on that to force an emotional response (which I think is a cheap way to make you feel stronger for a character). Anyway, the acting was really good. REALLY good. I really liked the hero. The monster, I hate to say it, was really terrifying, until you see it. I don't think it looks much like the glimpses you see through the rest of the movie, but oh well.

On a side note, for horror gamers: There were aspects of this show that really reminded me of the FEEL of Silent Hill - and I really liked that!",1457481600,4,690,4.2272727272727275

7269682,3,B00YZBF1YU,"Despite it's weaknesses, an entertaining creature flick for those inclined toward the sub-genre - very solid three stars.

The good:
Very, very good acting all around.
Creepy isolated winter setting, in what I believe is the American North East.
Neat cinematography; in particular, the blue filter used for the outdoor daytime scenes, which keeps the film from being too bright at any given moment, further augmenting the creepy setting.
A well-developed atmosphere of dread and foreboding.
A monster that is effectively hinted at but kept hidden for most of the movie. Most filmmakers do not practice enough of this restraint, so it's good to see it here; although budget probably had as much to do with this decision as anything (not that this movie shows its low budget in any negative way).

The not so good:
The lead protagonist is a little too slow on the uptake. Non-spoiler example: when stuff starts to happen, he doesn't thoroughly investigate the scene or remain engaged at the scene in the immediate aftermath, I just found these moments weakened the lead, although he is grieving over a loss, so I suppose one could say he was just acting as listless as he felt.
As is all too common, the last two seconds are a dumb cliche. Ignore them.
Minor complaint: the hard-driving rhythmic music over the closing credits destroys the creepy atmosphere the movie worked so hard to develop.

Ending on a positive note: the pros far outweigh the cons. Fun little flick.",1454889600,,1470,4.872

It stars as the sheriff Kevin Durand who is the exterminator in The Strain t.v. show. It also stars a grown up Lukas Haas, who was the young boy in The Witness (Harrison Ford).
This was a monster movie without the obvious monster suspects. It draws its monster from North American Indian folklore. This was a good change of pace. The movie is well acted and the story worked as well. The last standoff in a chuch was definitely tense.",1454371200,,635,4.578947368421052
7269686,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Dark Was the Night is a low budget horror film starring Kevin Durand and Lukas Haas that focuses on the sheriff and his deputy dealing with strange disappearances that soon lead into disturbances by a mysterious force that has come from the shadows, threatening all who live in the tiny town of Madison Woods.

This horror movie came out of nowhere, truly. I hadn't even known it existed until I saw it on the shelf at a Hastings. Then, I found it on Netflix, gave it a watch, and bought it the next day. Dark Was the Night focuses more on character building, pacing and atmosphere instead of jump scares, gore and simply put, violence. This movie has very little violence, very little scares, but a whole lot of tension and eerie direction. The color pallet used in-film is superb, with shades of blue painting the day, while night-time scenes are naturally lit, making it truly difficult to see anything. The visuals, they're a fifty-fifty takeaway. The very end of the film, you can tell their budget wasn't going to cut extensive visual effects, but that didn't take away from the creature design or the overall effect from the thrilling build-up; this is one movie where the shadows are its best friend. The acting was great, especially for a horror film. Kevin Durand sold each and every scene with stopping power that you'd expect from an A-lister like Idris Elba or Benicio Del Toro. His emotions were real, and the character was heart-breaking. Lukas Haas as his deputy gave a great performance, and shined when he had his simple, solo moments. The rest of the supporting cast also did very well, with no cheesy dialogue or random annoying freaks that sometimes come up in a creature-focused horror film. And then the script; the attention to detail and secretive backgrounds of the people and the town that are slowly revealed makes the movie play out like a book, which is just awesome.

If you're a film nut, someone who just loves movies in general, watch this. If you're a die-hard horror movie fan, watch this. If you're someone looking for an entertaining horror movie to watch with friends or a date night, this isn't that kind of movie. It's slower paced, it focuses more on characters than scares, and is a more ""believable"" creature-feature instead of a gorefest. I really hope Kevin Durand gets at least two or three leading roles in films like this, on bigger budgets, because he gave an award-worthy performance that deserves to be seen.",1454112000,7,2460,4.7453271028037385

I didn't know what to expect when I bought this but it sounded very interesting & for the price I was more then willing to give it a shot. Glad I did. This creature film follows the age old style of less is more in horror films. We are only given a glimpse of the creature throughout the film until the very end. Now, as others have said the creature effects aren't that great but don't let that stop you from giving this film a chance. Basic plot is a sheriff & his deputy are plagued by strange things happening in their small town & are trying to find out who or what is behind it. Its great seeing Kevin Durand in a staring role here. The acting is very good as is the story. Some scenes have great atmosphere also I feel. Not many special features, just a commentary & Q&A with the cast. The ending leaves it open for a sequel & I hope it gets one someday. If you enjoy creature films or are just looking for a really good horror film, definitely give this a watch.",1452556800,,1023,4.171717171717172

7269695,4,B00YZBF1YU,"The plot centres around the small rural town of Maiden Wood where the Sherriff has a lone deputy and not a lot happens. Then one day a horse goes missing and after a fall of snow  hoof prints are found all over the town. No-one recognises the type of beast that would leave such imprints and things start to escalate from there. There are ominous folk tales from the Native American bar keep  but that is all superstitious nonsense isn't it?

Now the Sherriff Paul Shields is played by Kevin Durand (X Men  Origins and I am Number Four) and he carries every scene he is in putting in a commendable performance that brings gravitas to what is basically a creature feature. The tension is ramped up well throughout and the back story of personal tragedy for the Sherriff is done exceptionally well, adding pathos to what would otherwise be a straight forward narrative.

There are a few moments when you question what is actually taking place plot wise, but they are used to keep the momentum up and on that count it scores pretty well. The ending though with the obligatory twist may annoy some people as to the credibility of it but we now almost expect a twist in all the tales. Still it kept me amused and interested for the majority of the 95 minute run time and so I can therefore recommend  that is with the caveat that this is one of those films that trades on the twists etc and so a rental option would be better value as you are not going to be falling over yourself to see it twice in a hurry.",1452038400,,1503,4.35

Two things I like about this movie. The lead actor did a fantastic job. He kept the movie from being a cheesy B flick. The other thing is that the movie has somewhat of a realistic feeling.

Two things I didn't like about the movie. One, some of the scenes were unrealistic (yes, I know I just stated the opposite). An example, a huge monster with cloven feet, walking on hardwood floors within a food behind a man but doesn't make a sound. The other, where are all the other people in the town? Honestly, neither of these type things are big issues.

It turned out to be a relatively decent, but not amazing, little story.  As other viewers have pointed out, it isn't a movie filled with aggressive, relentless violence, there are no screaming teenagers, which does make it refreshing.  Its a bit of a fairy tale, but it does fall a little flat.  Some viewers have found it to be a bit dull, and I can understand that  The ending is decent enough and do watch through the credits  as scenes provide a  little ""extra"" bit to the story that was a bit predictable but still satisfying.",1450224000,,676,4.630252100840337
7269699,4,B00YZBF1YU,"A leisurely horror movie that misses being a 5-star because of its cliched ending. If the story had stopped 3 minutes sooner, it would've been better. Otherwise, this is a very good, if somewhat low-key film of a sheriff guilt-ridden by his younger son's death, struggllng to regain his marriage and protect the people under his charge.

There are the usual characters involved but the expected formula deaths don't occur. The story outline follows the regular horror movie only so far before stopping and changing course and for that, I thank the scriptwriter. There might've been more of a cartharsis in the sheriff regaining his own forgiveness but considering the way his character is portrayed, perhaps the quiet acceptance he experienced may be better.  The film is slow-moving in its build-up, with glimpses of the creature...a claw here, a footprint there...there's very little blood and gore and the brief glimpses of bodies aren't dwelt upon or given close-ups.  The cinematography is very good and evocative...shot in cold blues or near black and white on occasion to give the idea of the cold of the winter landscape and the sheriff's isolation.

All in all it's a good film, well-acted but restrained. If you're expecting a blood-spattered feast, however, you'll be disappointed.

The entire movie was understated, quiet and it has a rare ending. Powerful authority doesn't mean dozens of people running the streets with automatic weapons looking for monsters, and shooting ""suspects"" at will. This one has a sheriff like Eben, in 30 Days of Night. And, I appreciated that the movie was dark because it was night (what a great title, by the way), but you could still see what was going on, unlike Alien vs Predator 2, where the whole damn thing was shot too dark at night (with rain, no less) or in the sewers, so you couldn't see the magnificence of the creatures.

7269743,5,B00YZBF1YU,"Any movie that stars Kevin Durand in it has a big plus going for it, in my humble opinion. He is a wonderful actor, and his portrayal of emotion is unmatched in excellence by any other male actor currently living. Having said that, the movie itself was also excellent. The music, lighting, and camera shots were expertly contrived to give the sense of the surrealism the townspeople are trying to come to grips with. Durand's character is that of town sheriff, whose young son recently died in a freak home accident while Durand was taking care of him. Wracked with guilt and feeling unable to protect anyone, Durand must deal with the horror that is menacing the town and have faith in his ability to protect. The script is well-written with the perfect balance of short, cryptic sentences and longer, soul-baring reveals. It's one of those movies you want to watch a couple of time.

7269747,1,B00YZBF1YU,"This was one of the lamest movies I have watched in a long time.  The movies is way too long and moves very slowly.  There is no real suspense.  The sheriff's favorite weapon is his flashlight.

In the movie, the sheriff is really the town chief of police.  Sheriffs serve the whole county not simply the local town.  Where the chief of police is we never learn.  Repeatedly the sheriff goes out and about with only a flashlight.  He is super slow to sense danger.  Only later in the film we learn he and his wife lost a child but that doesn't really add to the film.  Sheriff tells everyone to gather in the church of all places as the safest place in town.  But only a handful enter the church.  Where is the rest of the town?  Why is the church the safest place in town?  Looks no more safe than the local cafe.

Local calls sheriff to investigate damage to barn.  Sheriff takes local's gun.  Local doesn't complain whatsoever.  Later in the church, no one has guns except the antagonist to the sheriff and one other local.

Why the creatures have appeared doesn't make sense either.  Some strange folklore is bandied about but not really explained.  The best part of the film was the end were everyone is eaten by the creatures.  I could only think good riddance.

Mostly those don't get me anyway, so I actually prefer a flick with an engaging premise and characters, which this is.  If you're looking for SCARES, this isn't your movie.  This has more of the feel of an extended X-Files episode, meets Scandinavian crime drama (with the weird blue lighting), meets a SyFy monster movie (because it has a 'showdown' at the end).

7269756,5,B00YZBF1YU,"I was pretty surprised by this movie.  NOT a ""found footage"" flick (thank God), and not trying to be ""artsy"" or ""comedic"" (I like those kinds of movies, too, but, only when well done, which doesn't happen often).  It's basically just a good old fashioned B-movie creature feature that slowly and lovingly creates an ever-increasing atmosphere of creepiness until the climax.  It doesn't try to overload itself with a lot of spectacular action, as everything in the story is played for realism (other than the monster, that is).  Usually, in films like this, the back stories for the characters are just intrusions into the main plot and I find that the sub-plots that arise out of them just leave the movies treading water.  Here, however, I found myself genuinely engaged by them.  One reason, I feel, is that the back stories weren't the trite standard fair for B-movie ""traumatic"" pasts but were individualized for each character and were quite believable.  Another reason is that the actors were so well-cast in their roles and gave truly strong performances.  If you love safe, straight-forward monster movies but wished they didn't have to be a guilty pleasure, you'll like this one.  Like ""Species"", it's just a Saturday night drive-in flick made for adults who don't want their intelligence insulted.

7269768,4,B00YZBF1YU,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I love, love, LOVE creature-features, and I cannot get enough of them.  Films with monsters/creatures are some of my favorite in the horror genre (James Camerons ALIENS and John Carpenters THE THING are in my Top Five Horror Films of All Time, if that tells you anything).  So when I heard about DARK WAS THE NIGHT, I jumped on the opportunity to watch it.  After all, Ill give just about any monster movie a shot.  I will admit this film is not perfect, but its a lot of fun nonetheless, and fans of the genre like me will definitely want to give this one a look.

DARK WAS THE NIGHT is shot well and looks great onscreen (what I could see of it, anywaythe review copy I was given had a VERY annoying watermark that dominated most of the dark scenes).  I particularly like the locales chosen for the filming.  While they are not stunning in scope, they do a great job of building the desolate feel needed for the film.

The acting in DARK WAS THE NIGHT is pretty good, though Im surprised to see Kevin Durand in the lead.  Durand is a decent actor, however I was thrown a bit by seeing him in this role.  I picture him more as a heavy, a menacing figure that instills fear on those who see him.  Still, he does a pretty good job here.  The supporting cast do the same; I cant recall any wooden or particularly bad performances.

The story is nothing we haven't heard before, however thats just fine for a film like this.  The tension builds nicely, culminating to a climactic battle at the end.  Im very proud of the filmmakers for not revealing the creature in the DVD cover art or even too soon in the film.  I cannot stand it when distributors do this, and thus DARK WAS THE NIGHT is a nice change from the norm in regard to spoiling the surprise.

*SPOILER ALERT* But the creature is the cause for my problem with this film.  The beast looks wicked and downright viciousbut I don't think it would be found in the wintery northeast; it appears almost reptilian in nature, and thus, it wouldnt be trekking around in the snow.  Also, we don't get to see it long enough at the end.

 Still, with those two issues aside, DARK WAS THE NIGHT is an entertaining creature-feature that fans of the genre should enjoy.  I recommend it, and I hope to see a better version of it soon (minus the watermark).  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1442275200,5,2423,4.333333333333333

7269771,2,B00YZBF1YU,"Dark Was the Night squanders much of its charm early and often.  A slow-build horror movie set in a sleepy rural town, it tries to focus on the small moments in the life of a small-town sheriff, but never manages to make an emotional connection.  When the monster inevitably makes an appearance, the wheels fall completely off.  The film hides the creature for too long (more on that) and has an anemic body count to show for it, and we never really care who is going to get murdered in lackluster fashion next.  When we do see the monster, it is a complete joke:  this is the cheesiest looking computer-generated monster I have seen since the era of the Playstation 1.  It's terri-bad.

Spoliers / plot

I watched this movie largely because of the fact that Kevin Durand was in it.  He plays a small town sheriff and it is clear that he is grieving over something.  As the movie develops we learn that one of his sons was killed in an accident and his inability to forgive himself has caused his wife to move out.  With this backdrop we also have odd and increasingly ominous happenings in the woods and in the town itself.

The movie does a good job with building suspense and keeping you guessing on what is causing the strange events.  My problem was with the ending...you expect in a horror film to have a final scene that shows the problem is not really over (and possibly set up for a sequel), yet the final scene in this film is frankly depressing and not keeping with the mood of the rest of the movie.  Worth a watch but still not a great flick.",1439942400,,919,4.271676300578035
7269827,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Fun, Different.

Not a traditional horror, nor sci-fi. I liken it to Alien, but with crappier special effects. There isn't the wholesale slaughter you see in many ""monster movies"" and the town and it's people were creepy enough before the whole creature in the woods thing. People are led to believe it is due to stupid human's deforesting our planet, and unleashing ancient things, but the ending makes me think that the director was clever and sent his message while not leaving you with weak absolutes.

For those of you who enjoy hollywood endings, found footage films, or the traditional good versus evil, I probably wouldn't recommend if those are your only tastes. If you're one who enjoys clever understatement and dark movies that hold just as much psychological involvement as they do danger, then you might enjoy this film immensely.

If you're looking just for a popcorn movie, then maybe skip this one - it's fairly cerebral in a certain sense. While everyone in the film is some kind of backwoods (and maybe a little backwards) hick, the best parts of the film to me were the ones that said volumes silently with tension and subtlety.

Also, I loved the whole ""grim dark"" at the end. Some might not like that bit, but to me the movie would've suffered at least 2 stars if they hadn't included it.",1439942400,,1310,4.707423580786026

7269836,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Kevin Durand plays Sheriff Paul Shields, the lead in this movie. I usually see him in secondary roles so I was apprehensive to how good this movie was going to be. Lukas Haas plays the Deputy Donny Saunders and his is not playing Deputy Barney Fife. It is a great scary storyline. Man disturbs nature for greed and then, Theres something in the woods. The Sheriff and the Deputy have a great plausible theory on the creature. As with most great horror films, in this movie the creature is hidden throughout the first half of the movie. Classic but great twist ending. The movie runs a bit slow at first; but, all the characters make themselves known and the back stories are brought in naturally. I think both Kevin Durand is usually the villain or part of the bad guy side. He makes a great good guy and can really pull off a leading role. Id like to see Kevin Durand in more leading roles.

The movie does drag on much more than it needed to but it maintained a certain anxiousness to it that holds you there waiting to see what's going to happen. Direction was ok but the camera work needed better post production to sharpen up the scenes for a crisper appearance. The story was sort of sub-par but you can tell it did not have a very big budget and I assume they worked with what they had.

They could of did so much with this.....take the monster out and throw in a Vampire or Werewolf and this thing would of rocked. Needed more monster attacks.

7269846,2,B00YZBF1YU,"What a silly movie.  I was hooked by the dark scenes in the trailer, and choose to ignore the negative reviews so I could waste time on this.

The story:
Yes, the same old tried and true formula, but the formula of something unknown is hiding in the woods, is still around because well, it works.

The acting:
Most of the actors do a good job, with exception of the deputy sheriff.  I don't look at him and see a law enforcement man at all.

The scenery:
Well this one of the parts that the director really blew.

When someone does a horror movie, they generally shift the white balance toward the cooler(blue side) of the white balance to invoke a scary, slightly foreboding mood in the viewers mind.  However, in this movie the cool white balance was pushed WAY too far, and everything came out looking way too blue, and way too flat. This may seem too nit-picky, but the blue tinge was distracting.

Inside scenes during night were okay.

Execution of the ""horror film formula"":
1. A depressed main character that just went through a tragedy, CHECK
2. A somber, blue tinged feeling, Partial check(this was way overdone)
3. The main character is having relationship problems, due to depression over a recent tragedy, CHECK
4. The main character that is supposed to protect everyone is having doubts about his abilities, CHECK.
5. The main character that is doubting himself has an opportunity to test himself, to rediscover his purpose, CHECK.
6. Plenty of startle moments, where you get a dramatic, quick music score, and a quick glimpse of something you can't make out, CHECK
7. The creature finally is revealed in all its horrific glory at the end, BLANK
8. The typical horror movie ending where the characters think everything is okay, but there is a lead in to a sequel, CHECK

Summary:
If I hadn't paid nearly 5 dollars to rent this, I would have been okay.  As it is, I am dissapointed I wasted my money on this poorly done, low budget video.  All though most of the check marks are in place, parts are done poorly, or overdone.  The character development is pretty vacant.  I didn't really care about anyone in the video.  I didn't really hate the loudmouth character.  I didn't really feel for the sheriff.  I didn't believe the deputy was in law enforcement at all.

I would wait for this to come out free in prime.  If it doesn't make it, I will be surprised...",1439510400,5,2374,4.569739952718676

7269849,1,B00YZBF1YU,"Dark Was the Night?  Isn't that like calling a movie Bright Was the Sun or Wet Was the Water?  This is a deadly dull monster movie about a large creature driven out of its habitat by logging.  It moves south towards a small town and starts killing off the local wildlife.  The material is treated with dramatic gravity that isn't a good fit for a monster movie--the characters speak slowly as if their dialogue was actually worth hearing; the sheriff and his deputy both have completely unnecessary tragic backstories; God and having a purpose come up multiple times as if something larger was at stake.

Beyond being boring almost beyond endurance Dark Was the Night is also spectacularly dumb.  This small town is in hunting country--so why not gather everyone up who has a weapon and look for this thing?  Or why barricade the townspeople inside a church when this thing can clearly climb high (victims are found very high up trees) and there are windows along every wall?  Unless you think the creature can't enter holy ground there has to be an easier place to protect until morning than a large church--with windows everywhere and wooden walls no less, even though it previously clawed very deep into the wooden wall of a barn.

Not surprisingly the church doesn't turn out to be such a great place to defend, despite the sheriff claiming it was the best place for everyone to be.  It's possible this is meant as some sort of faith based monster movie, which is honestly the only explanation I can come up with for the weirdly existential dialogue and ill-advised use of the church as a hiding place.

Dark Was the Night has no suspense, no exciting animal attacks and no gore--there's nothing, really, that could possibly make this thing appealing for a horror fan.  Dark Was the Night takes itself very seriously but it's unlikely viewers will do the same.",1439424000,,1864,4.719135802469136

Possible spoilers

The movie focuses heavily upon the triple split hooved prints found everywhere in town, but when the creature is revealed the director decided to give us some kind of reptile with dinosaur or bird like taloned feet with no hoof at all. Rather than the goatman or jersey devil like creature that the movie eludes to. The creature was also roughly 350 or more lbs in apearance not exactly the tree dwelling animal they where looking for. Some of the trees it hopped between at super sonic speeds  early on before you see it at the end where so thin they would crush leading you to beleive yet again its a fast nimble forest creature rather that a t rex adapted to the frigid cold. The last 20 seconds of the movie ruined the whole film. They should have cut it.
Im not a knit picker but the above along with some other inconstinstanies really got me.

SPOILER ALERT:  I think the movie does wait a bit long to tell you why he is so depressed, but when you find out it is the loss of his child while he was supposed to be watching, well as a father I can feel that and connected to his acting very well.

SPOILER ALERT:  The movie does not let you see the creature until near the end, but it plays it up good without having to see it, suspense and terror are nicely done in the scenes.  At first I agreed with other commenters about the ""cheesy"" appearance of the creature, assuming the same CG shop was used that SyFy uses in all their junk.  After watching a couple of times I realized the creature was designed to look like tree bark, which makes sense since the things live in the trees.  You don't get to see this since it is only implied when they are in the trees, you never get to see one in a tree to make the connection.

7269895,2,B00YZBF1YU,"This is a difficult movie for me to rate. From an excitement point of view, it's a 2. From a well-done with little perspective, it's a 3.5 . An interesting movie...it's slow but has some unique production/cinematography aspects and a dark mood. The monster is a let-down in the end (fyi it's clear that it's not the devil, as another reviewer thought). The film is basically a well-produced scifi channel type of movie. I admire the filmakers for what they were trying to achieve, but I feel that they could have made the story a little faster and more varied than it was. I'd say it's worth $3. I've seen better movies on amazon for $4, so I will rate it 2 for that reason.

Edit: I see a lot of fake 5 star reviews tagged on after every low rating. One said the ending was unique. No, it's not. If you've seen Willow Creek, Abominable, or Animal, then you will know how it ended.",1438646400,,881,4.33939393939394

Now first let me say that overall this isn't a bad movie, the acting is solid, and the cinematography and atmosphere is well done. Also the buildup was well done, my biggest issue with this film, is that there is lots of good lead up. But then the end falls flat.
Overall, not a bad movie, worth a watch.",1438646400,2,549,4.0

7269898,4,B00YZBF1YU,"I'm a big fan of the horror genre, but the glut of found footage movies shot with someone's borrowed camera, one dimensional actors, and the use of gore and naked women, usually teens, have made finding a horror movie worth watching to the end a real task. I rented this only because Kevin Durand was the lead. He surprised me with the quality of his acting in ""The Strain"", and surpassed that with his performance as a troubled, grieving husband, haunted by the death of his child, and determined to protect his remaining son, and the people in his town. The supporting actors were also good, but I had the impression that they may have been working on a lean budget with the lack of extras - the town seems almost deserted throughout the movie. The pace was slow, but still had it''s moments that made me sit up suddenly - it wasn't a film that will have you leaving the light on when you go to bed, but still, a solid performance all around. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because while it built tension throughout the movie it was easy to see where it was going to peak. Also, the special effects ... well, like I said, I think they had a pretty small budget for the film. I was just glad to see solid characters who weren't completely one dimensional, and good acting. I won't make this a spoiler, but the last 4 seconds made me say, ""Oh, come on!"" - you'll understand when you see it - and if horror is your thing, you really should see it.",1438560000,39,1448,4.288321167883212
7269899,3,B00YZBF1YU,"""Dark Was the Night"" and ""Monster Hunter"" are the same film. The small quiet town of Maiden Woods (Pop. 243) appears to be annoyed by a ""Bigfoot"" type creature as the virgin woods to the north is being harvested. Sheriff Paul Shields (Kevin Durand) who has some personal problems getting over the death of his son , is aided by Luke Haas (the kid from ""Witness"" all grown up) as they try to solve the problem of the missing horse, pets, and strange footprints all over town. The drama and action build up slow until the end when we get to see the creature (unless you have the UK DVD ""Monster Hunter"" then it's on the plot spoiler cover).

People acted fairly civil in this film. The drama was mostly internal conflicts, i.e. Sheriff Paul fighting his own demon within until he has to face the legend of the woods. The slowness of the movie had ""TV production"" written all over it. For those who prefer high drama, low action horror, with character development, this one has it.",1438560000,,978,4.49438202247191

7269903,3,B00YZBF1YU,"listen, the movie is not bad. I was slightly disappointed due to how scary a lot a flix have gotten now, to me this wasn't scary. Harry Potter had scarier stuff in it lets just say that. Anyways, it's more of a drama like the movie Signs if you remember that one. Their were 2 actors, a bar fly and the bartender that were very cheesy written characters with crap lines that certainly removed stars for me. The movie was worth watching if you want decent acting, drama, good filming and atmosphere and are not expecting to be scared all that much. The monster is just kinda ehh. Let me tell you this, if you want something suspenseful , scary but in a new kind of way, best acting you ever saw, great drama, amazing filming and effects go watch Troll Hunter instead of this. It's subtitled but it's seriously one of the top movies in my lifetime for monster movies.

Last thing, some of you reviewers are writing up as if your doing this for a magazine article . Knock it off, we know what the movie is about from the descriptions.  You say way too much. When you start saying stuff like "" it starts in a small town facing an oncoming storm, with a sherif dealing with his personal loss, and animals start appearing to be attacked and some guys turn up missing and then found,,,,,,,"" ok ok stop already. We want your thoughts on the movie, not another exact description of the movie! Stop trying to be a reviewer for a magazine and just explain for people why they may or may not want to watch this. Add some darn spoiler alerts if your going to get that into it, if you just can't resist re telling the entire flick. When you say in a review, the monster is only seen in the beginning or middle or end, then you take all the suspense out of it for those who haven't seen it. Just say the monster is only seen a few times or something. Just quit trying to be Wikipedia for movie reviews.",1438387200,3,1887,4.268156424581005
7269904,2,B00YZBF1YU,"I'm the first to admit that I'm a tough critic.  I love a good monster movie s as much as the next person, especially those who grew up watching creature feature double features on channel 38.  It's just so hard to find a good one these days and sadly this movie is no exception.  It started in a promising fashion with lots of rustling in the woods, mutilated animal corpses and scratch marks left behind on trees and barns.  But after a while this horror device fails to maintain tension.  It's simply repeated too many times and ultimately doesn't really up the ante very well.

I went into this with no expectations other than the few reviews I read which emphasized character development and mood.  I'll give it thumbs up for mood, but our hero (while well acted with what he had), is rather bland and his relationship with his wife and son don't very far beyond the surface. There's no real arc to the story other than when the main character finally realizes there's something strange going on that can't be explained very easily.

The concept of a devil in the woods is a great one and the idea that a creature may have been there all along, as in the giant fish discovered in Asia described in this film, are neat ideas.  Unfortunately I wasn't really sure which direction this movie wanted to go...  is this creature a demon or an animal?  We are never really sure even after the final reveal at the end but I wish they had chosen one or the other and explored that idea much more fully.  This film delivers on atmosphere but fails on good story development.  It's rich with cool ideas but just fell flat for me.",1438387200,2,1622,4.4391891891891895

7269906,5,B00YZBF1YU,"This was one of the best horror movies I've seen in quite awhile. Riveting, action-packed, with a sub-plot of a sheriff in a small town ridden with guilt over the death of one of his sons. Estranged from his wife, he tries to keep a good relationship with his younger son, but can't get passed the remorse. Then, a creature from the woods begins tearing people and livestock apart, and he, along with his deputy, try to solve the murders, under the watchful eyes of the townsfolk, who are giving him a hard time. So I won't tell anything else,  it might spoil the movie.
Credit to the script writer, and the fine directing. The acting is also credible, especially from Kevin Durand, who is in a horror television series. This movie was really scary and a treat for horror fans. Need I say more?",1438300800,,794,4.475862068965517
7269907,3,B00YZBF1YU,"Okay.
Let me begin by saying that the acting and story were great. The film quality was also great. The ""antagonist"" (no desire to ruin the film for those who have not seen it) left much to be desired in appearance. Also, the last 10 seconds of the film ruined the whole thing for me. It felt like they had finished a really great story and then handed the whole thing over to the guy that works in the mail room and said ""here. Slap a twist on this and we'll call it a day.""
All in all, it was definitely worth watching. I loved the actors (Derand was especially good). Give it a try. Just...ignore the last 10 seconds and pretend it never happened.",1438300800,2,650,4.208
7269908,5,B00YZBF1YU,"Because they did everything right including a great cast , very well written and just enough special effects to keep you on the edge of your seat! And who isn't at least a little afraid of the woods. They feed you a few tidbits about the creature and build on that until your not sure what it is! Not going to spoil it for others by saying anymore than that but I will say that a few times I couldn't catch my breath during some of the scary jolts that exist through out the film. I watch scary movies all the time but this one is special! My compliments to all that worked on this film because they got it right .",1438300800,,614,4.040983606557377

I'm a huge horror movie fan, and it takes a lot to really scare me, but this movie knows how to give just the right elements to make it scary enough to keep watching, despite the fact that the grief that the lead character is going through drags the story down a bit.  It really wasn't necessary to have so many of the scenes where the sheriff just sits there practically in a stupor, I get it that he was grieving the loss of one of his children. However, he did come through for his family and his town, it was incredible brave to go up against that creature, which no one had gotten a good look at until the final scene when he was fighting it. And the realization that they came to in the end when the deputy saw the creature's body, Wow, I would love to have seen that town the next day. And this movie is proof that you don't need to have scenes with buckets of blood and gore to make a good horror movie because there is none at all in it except a minor wound on the only survivor of an attack has, this movie tells it's story with good old fashioned horror and the suspense of the creature just being out of view until near the end.",1523664000,,1278,4.031496062992126

8719401,4,B00YZBF1YU,"Not perfect, but quite well-done.  I'm generally a fan of old-school style horror movies that don't rely on a lot of gore or jump scares, and this movie was definitely in my wheelhouse.  There's apparently a malevolent creature on the prowl in the woods around this small, rural upstate New York town, and while most in the town try to dismiss it as something explainable, that becomes increasingly difficult for everyone.  At the same time, it's a family drama, with the sheriff having lost one young son in a previous accident, and now struggling to maintain his relationship with his wife and other young son amidst everything.  It's the old-school horror movie formula of seeking to build atmosphere and tension for most of the film before showing us the monster, and there's a reason that formula has been  used so often--it works.  I know some have complained about the look of the monster at the end, but I thought it looked fine--quite scary and menacing.

The image of the Blu-ray was very sharp, and although I'm not usually a fan of the bleached-out color palette in modern films, it worked okay here.  The actors and director did generally strong work, and the dialogue was pretty natural.  Although there was some, I might have liked a little more of characters telling of the local legends of the creature, as I didn't get that great a sense of the backstory of the creature.

Overall, this is my kind of horror movie--slow burning, atmospheric and non-gory.  This was a blind-buy for me, and I was very happy with it.",1521849600,,1532,4.7218045112781954

8719403,5,B00YZBF1YU,"i like Kevin Durand,  in a ""troubled"" kind of way. He's no Kurt Russel or Val Kilmer, but he's good ... kinda out there.  I think he was some kind of ""Bully Angel"" in another good movie. Anyway, It's actually scary. There's a tension that is very real. The creatures could have been re-thunk. When finally revealed, all I could think was ""Mimic"" with hooves.

And, just when you thought it was safe ... the guy with the big ears turns back up from ""Witness"" 20 years ago. The ""Back-up Deputy"" in Bone Tomahawk was much better. Now that's a GREAT movie.

If ya wanna see some really scary inbreeds ... ""The House October Built"".  I hate clowns.",1520726400,,643,4.415254237288136
