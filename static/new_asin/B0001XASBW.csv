Not for the timid.",1425254400,2,452,5.565217391304348
8017800,5,B0001XASBW,"These guys are exceptional at doing the unthinkable and unimaginable.  I saw them in a parking lot across from ""Area"" in TRIBECA in the 1980's and they were twisted then.  The machinary, the meat, the men...it is all truly strange and worth the time to investigate.
Yes, this is decadence at its height!",1354579200,,303,4.69811320754717
8017801,4,B0001XASBW,"For the uninitiated, imagine a Hellraiser movie filming immense Robot Wars UK style machines on the set of a Skinny Puppy music video... there's big metal stuff blowing other stuff to flinders, with an occasional twitching carcass thrown in. High art for technofetishists, gearheads, nihilists and such... not for vegetarians, kids or the weak.

 The disk runs through 3 shortish main features and a few extra select snippets from here and there. Watch the audience squeal and scramble away from their perceived doom... watch the beautiful and grotesque metal creatures shiver and tear themselves to bits.

 As a fan of the old VHS copies from way back, I was quite surprised at the quality of the video on DVD here... very crisp and professionally done, for this sort of thing. Comes in a standard plastic keep case with no liner notes or extras(ow), but still worth every penny if you remember these folks or want to scare the kids wet at a future Halloween party/rave.",1090886400,8,971,4.866666666666666
8017802,5,B0001XASBW,"This is a great DVD for any SRL fan. Includes, in their entirety: A Bitter Message of Hopeless Grief, The Will to Provoke, The Delusions of Expediency: How to avoid Responsibility For Social Disintergration By Acting Without Principle Under the Pretenses of Utility. Also has a number of interviews and 'special editions' of selected documentaries. Well worth it.",1085529600,8,363,5.275862068965517
