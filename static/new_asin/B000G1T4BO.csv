8598173,4,B000G1T4BO,"Very good instructors.  The katas are well demonstrated and described.  However it does not replace a live instructor.  Additionally, the instructors wore gi pants that are deliberately designed to obscure the motion of the feet.  Under normal circumstances that would be acceptable but in a teaching DVD that is not helpful when one needs to see how the feet move.  I would recommend this DVD to someone who has a basic knowledge of kobudo.",1408147200,,441,4.905405405405405
8598174,1,B000G1T4BO,"This DVD only has 1 kata per weapon (4 kata total).
 I was really disappointed with this item. a big waste of $30.00 precious dollars.",1282780800,2,134,4.36
