938952,3,630488740X,"I really enjoyed this film because of its cinemetography. The problem is, it did not have enough educating information. Most of the information was specific to the wolves they trained. But I guess that was their aim. I was expecting more than beautiful scenes and narration. But I really enjoyed it.",1111190400,2,299,4.882352941176471
938953,5,630488740X,I don't think any animal lover could see this documentary and not end up falling in love with these wolves.  Jim Dutcher's documentation of the life of the Sawtooth pack is both delightful and heart-wrenching.  This video is a must-see for anyone interested in wolves or dogs.,1081555200,4,276,4.851063829787234
938954,4,630488740X,"A wonderful heart warming documentary telling the story of a family of wolves and their leader Kamots. Never before have i seen this side of wolves ,the family side. A must see for all wild animals lovers. Most touching moments were at the end when kamots and his family say good bye to the Dutchers in their own wolvy way. Definetley worth seeing.",1073520000,6,348,4.5396825396825395
938955,5,630488740X,I first bought this 5 or 6 years ago and after watching it once I cried the next few times I saw it. This is a MUST see for anyone who loves wolves...especially those like me who have a wolfdog. In fact both of my wolf dogs are named after the alpha and omega in the pack that served as ambassadors between humans and wolves. This video also helps the dog owner to understand the behavior of dogs in relation to discipline and pack responses. Definately worth the money...,1044921600,3,472,4.314606741573034
938956,5,630488740X,"This video is absolutely worthwhile to both trainers/behaviorists and to the layperson who's interested in wolves, their pack behavior and ranking, and how humans can interact with these beautiful wild animals.
I'm a dog trainer and obedience instructor, and saw this when it first aired on television - I was studying training at that time.  It was not only waaay enjoyable, but also a close-up opportunity to learn.
The book 'The Sawtooth Wolves' is an excellent companion to the video.",1013299200,4,488,5.1
938957,3,630488740X,"My love for the sawtooth pack began many years ago when I picked up a copy of the book ""The Sawtooth Wolves"" in a bookstore. I read that book until the cover was torn and loved every page of it. I then purchased the video and realized what I fell in love with. Jim Dutcher, the ""owner"" of the wolves, didn't care about the wolves. He wanted to film them and photograph them, but in general, he didn't want to help them; he wanted money. The money that I unknowningly sent his way by purchasing his book and his video. I was much younger when I bought his book...but in the book, he made it seem as though he couldn't help having the land taken away from him. I guess in my mind, I didn't want to believe that he would raise these wolves just for fame and then hand them off to someone else. Although, I have to admit, he found a wonderful new home for them, for which I am grateful. Anyway, this movie is getting a few stars from me because of it's content. Although, it is not one of my favorites from an ethical point of view, the photography is wonderful and you get an in-depth look into the lifestyle and habits of a pack of wolves. If you are going to purchase this movie, buy it used and give the extra few dollars you saved to a trustworthy wolf organization. P.S. I know of many if you would like to e-mail me! :-)",999820800,15,1323,4.131782945736434
938958,5,630488740X,"My 4th grade students and I adopted a wolf from the WERC organization and the Wolves of the Nez Perce. I was delighted to find a video that documented their development and let us see our wolf, Lakota, interacting with his pack and his environment.  Showing this informative video really helped my students (and me) to develop a deeper affection for Lakota as we watched him fail and succeed in his everyday routine.  I would highly recommend this video to adoptive wolf parents and classes.  The video is very well done with tons of factual information as well as with presenting a humanistic side to the wolves so that we may develop feelings for them.  This video will having you laughing, cheering, crying, and caring about the wolves.  The camera work is very up close and personal, too, so that you feel you are right in the forest with the Sawtooth pack. Don't miss this incredible opportunity to learn about these amazing and beautiful animals.",992995200,5,952,4.745454545454545
938959,5,630488740X,"Filmmakers Jim & Jamie Dutcher embark on a 6-year journey which takes them from the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho to the native lands of the Nez Perce tribe as they raise and bond with a pack of gray wolves they raise  from puppies.  The Dutchers must take care not to make pets of these  magical creatures, but instead to integrate them into the social hierarchy  of the adult Sawtooth pack.  Any ideas harbored about wolves being vicious  beasts will be dispelled as you view astonishing, illuminating images of  these mystical animals playing, and caring for both their pack mates and  the Dutchers!  Narrated by Richard Kiley, the 50 minute film produced for  the Discovery Channel is heart-warming, compelling, educational, and  remarkable in its ability to both affect emotions and help the viewer truly  understand how these incredible animals have been misunderstood and  maligned at the hands of man, and why wolves must be saved as they are an  absolutely necessary piece of our ecological tapestry! The vision of Jim  Dutcher sitting in the snow-laden wilderness as the alpha-male, Kamots,  puts his paw respectfully into Jim's hand will take your breath away!  Unparalled cinematography and beautiful music! A film to be watched again  and again!",946080000,9,1256,5.073529411764706
938960,5,630488740X,"This is absolutely the best documentary on wolf behavior I have ever seen.  The footage is amazing--I can't believe they were able to capture these beautiful creatures in such an open, natural state.  This particular film  maker defies tradition and exposes young wolf pups to human care in the  wild--they grow up believing the camp is a part of their surroundings, and  as a result they act very naturally.  The human involvement makes for some  touching scenes, such as the baby alpha howling on his lap or the  full-grown alpha licking his face in the snow.  The film is also well  structured, covering the care of the pups to their release from camp, their  mating choices, the birth of new cubs and competition for social position.  It is truly a beautiful and very enlightening film.",943574400,7,790,4.770370370370371
939037,5,630488740X,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone, but especially to those who are uniformed or uneducated about wolves and their place in the ecosystem.  Many myths and prejudices still exist concerning the wolf and this DVD helps answer questions people may have about the wolf.  It's also put together wonderfully.",1358985600,,304,5.06
939038,5,630488740X,"When I purchased this item I didn't realize that it was a vhs tape. However I did share this with one of my granddaughters who also loves wolves and after viewing it she now owns it. This story goes into great detail about the life of the wolves and how they develop their ""pecking order"". Each wolf in the pack has his or her own ""job"" for lack of a better word. The Alpha wolf eats at the kill first and then designates who eats next all the way down to the Omega wolf. Even tho there may be more than 1 female only the Alpha female will mate with the leader. These animals are loyal to their own and to the humans who built the wolf preserve. They were never treated as pets but were well respected on their turf by the Dutchers. There was a lot of interaction between the humans and the wolves and this film was 6 years in the making. Wolves are beautiful animals and hghly characterized as bloodthirsty villians of nature and this film proves all that to be wrong. They also have an extensive communication system with the different howls that they produce. I reccomend this film either in vhs or dvd to anyone who wants to learn more about these beautiful creatures.",1343260800,,1172,4.331818181818182
939039,3,630488740X,"Wolves at Our Door is a good film about the subject, but with substantial flaws at its core.

To be fair, the wolves are as portrayed; strong, capable carnivores with complex social lives and a reputation which is undeserved. Also, the footage of the wolves is well done.

But all is not well here.

I remember the first time I heard that Disney's True Life Adventures had made footage of lemmings leaping to their doom over cliffs, something which I later discovered that they don't do intentionally, by filling buckets with the rodents and tossing them in the sea. Few things on the screen are as they seem, apparently. Even in the case of wildlife documentaries such as Wolves at Our Door.

For many years, I worked for the Wolf Education and Research Center, the non-profit created to take care of the Sawtooth Pack after Jim Dutcher completed filming Wolves at Our Door. Doing so has given me some insight into both wolves and the work of Jim Dutcher.

The Sawtooth Pack were never really wild. They were born in captivity in Canada and purchased by Jim Dutcher for the film.

During the filming, a black wolf named Aipuyi was euthanized upon orders from Jim Dutcher, against the suggestions of the vet and handler he had hired to care for the wolves during filming. The film gives the impression that the Sawtooth Pack was given to the Nez Pierce tribe in Idaho, but this isn't the case either. The wolves were sold for tens of thousands of dollars to a non-profit organization hastily created to save the wolves, after Dutcher had commented that euthanizing the wolves was an option he was considering. The wolves came with a restrictive agreement which gave most photographic rights to Dutcher. The non-profit group couldn't even use images of the wolves on merchandise in order to support itself or the wolves.

The whole sordid affair came out on the internet, and one can still find references, comments and articles about the issue if one searches. The Internet has a long memory.

I'm almost sorry to say that we -should- view ""Wolves at Our Door."" It's probably the one video in recent times which has done more to educate people about wolves than most others. But remember, it -is- about the wolves and their plight, and we should always carefully consider if, in the case of wildlife documentaries, the ends justifies the means.",1318982400,,2344,4.742014742014742
939040,5,630488740X,This documentary shows the wolves in their true form. They are not the fierce beasts that some people make them out to be. They are beautiful animals.,1299974400,,150,4.592592592592593
939041,2,630488740X,"The shots of the wolves and the scenery are truly beautiful. If you are interested in that kind of eye candy, by all means get this movie. Also, if you are interested in rich people messing with wild animals to fulfill selfish dreams of touching nature, this one's for you. If, however, you want to find out about the diverse truths of wolf pack life as it happens to these amazing creatures in the wild, avoid this at all costs. I appreciate that young children enjoy watching the wolves being played with as if they are pets, but in reality, it does neither them nor the wild packs any good, as it glosses over the actual complex issue of wolves in the wild living near human livestock. Let me say that I am an advocate of wolves being restored to their rightful place in N America, but as wolf-positive as this movie is, I cannot recommend it. (For more reasons why, do a websearch for Sawtooth Pack and check out the current controversies on the state of the pack and their caretaking organization.) Or if you do see it, immediately afterwards, read Yellowstone Wolves in the Wild.",1147132800,7,1085,4.5126903553299496
939042,4,630488740X,"While it's worth keeping in mind the controversy raised by the Dutchers' approach of raising a wolf pack from pups so they'd have no fear of the filmmakers, the results are undeniably powerful, and -- from a public relations standpoint for wolves -- undeniably positive. There aren't any other films I'm aware of that delve as deeply and richly into wolf pack structure and behavior as ""Wolves at Our Door"" does. Those in the wildlife preservation field may disapprove of Dutcher's methods, and there are definite controversies over some of his decisions regarding the pack, but it's hard for me not to believe that, on the balance, this portrayal of wolves -- the film itself -- didn't do good. For any wolf enthusiast (or just wolf-curious), this is worth seeking out.

While as of this writing the DVD appears to be out of print, there is a book still in print (helpfully available from Amazon as well) written by Jim Dutcher in 2003 which goes into the story in more detail, as well as touching on the story of the Sawtooth Pack after the film at the Wolf Education and Research Center in Winchester, Idaho.",1140220800,4,1111,4.697435897435898
939043,3,630488740X,"I too had mixed emotions concerning this film. This was clearly not scientific investigation or methodology right from the start, however well-intended. I questioned leaving their human scent, and creating non-aggressive, non-threatening bonds with a variety of pack members over an extended period of time.

  The propensity to Anthropomorphic thinking was frightening- naming and assigning various human attributes and personality traits to nearly all of the pack. Likewise, the lack of gathering real information that might have enabled future scientists, combined with exposing the pack to humans, makes this pack tainted to the point where future investigation is nearly pointless, except to monitor the long-term negative consequences of the indiscretion.

  And yet, the cinematography was astounding, the story was touching and heart-warming, the understanding gleamed was invaluable, despite controversial consequences. The story could easily become a model for the study of aggression, dominance, and social organization. Perhaps the effort was worth it, perhaps not. The makers could have at least acknowledged the dangers of their venture and held themselves accountable, as countless other scientists have done in the past.

  Maybe the harm will be undone with time, as the pack diverges and memories fade, or worse, maybe this pattern of film making will be admired and emulated by many young minds to come. I am sadly reminded of treasure hunters who take extraordinary efforts to lead us to fantastic sites, only to destroy the evidence and the wealth of information it might have provided for the future.

  If this seems over-critical, then ask yourself what was the price paid for this film, and who did it ultimately benefit? In the end, these wary wolves are smarter than we give them credit for, they have survived us many times over by adapting... that is the magic, and the glory of their legend.

939044,1,630488740X,"This movie sets conservation issues back decades. The filmmakers are not scientists, yet present themselves as such. They give names to these wild animals, and habituate them and treat them as pets. None of the previous reviewers thought to ask themselves if this were actually beneficial for the wolves.

As a wildlife rehabilitator, I can tell you it is not. Now those wolves have become habituated to people. As they roam free throughout the woods to hunt, did the filmmakers ever think that there would be some humans out there who would harm or kill these wolves if approached by them? I would like to know what became of this pack after these selfish opportunists moved on. I am willing to bet that at least one of them was killed as a result of a human-wildlife conflict gone awry: a conflict that would not have occured if these people had not systematically destroyed the wolves' natural fear of people. Its self-righteous attitudes like those of these filmmakers that are contributing to, not preventing, the destruction of wildlife.

Instead, watch ""Never Cry Wolf"" to see a poignant depiction of how it is possible to love wildlife to death.",1125705600,12,1153,4.847715736040609
939045,5,630488740X,"I also adopted one of the Sawtooth Pack wolves when I was younger, Weyekin. I thought she seemed a lot like me, shy but sensitive. I tried to assign the names of the pack wolves to all of my friends. One was Matsi, another Amani, and another Kamots. OK, I was a little obsessed. But the bottom line is, this movie is a must-see for any wolf enthusiast, especially one interested in the Sawtooth pack.

7879307,4,630488740X,"First impressions matter. People can go on and on about how they do
not, but in reality, they leave lasting imprints. These lasting
imprints then transition over to other individuals, as people feed off
of each other's emotions. For centuries, wolves have been given
negative connotations due to their first impressions characterized as
being wild savages. Changing a first impression is not always easy,
however Jim and Jamie Dutcher do an excellent job by showing their
audience an unknown side of this species in the documentary film,
Wolves at Our Door. The film introduces the audience to the typical
perspective humans have on one of nature's keystone species, wolves.
Most see them as ruthless, wild savages running through the forest,
haunting humans and appearing in their nightmares. However, Jim and
Jamie Dutcher seek to shine a new light on these mysterious creatures
by sharing their experience of living among these intelligent and
highly structured animals. The couple not only observe, but also filme
a pack of captive wolves (the Sawtooth Pack) in an enclosed area in
Idaho's wilderness. To gain the wolves trust, Jim and Jamie feed and
care for the pups to ensure a bond is established before allowing them
to roam free within the encampment in a manner that very few people
ever have. With the couple being trusted and living side by side with
the wolves, they were able to use visual and audio recordings to
uncover an unknown side of these creatures. What they witnessed came to
be captured footage of the wolves' beautiful interactive language, the
social structure holding peace within the pack, and an inclusive family
unit. Throughout the documentary, the pack's hierarchy centering around
a cooperative, strong and social family bonds, gives a new perspective
to these once known, savage wolves.",1497312000,,1822,5.117449664429531
