2219030,5,B0007LXOHI,"There has been a bunch of people claiming to know the number of episodes per disc, the number of discs in the starter set, etc. It's been said that there are 3 episodes (or episode 1-3) on Saiyan Showdown, yet it looks like there are only 7/8 discs in the box. I wish someone would clarify this for me. Even with all of this I can't wait. By the way, they are redubbing Japanese episodes 1-67, not just the first 50. I'm hoping they don't redub episode 68 since episode 54 of the US episode contains 10 minutes of episode 67.",1109635200,3,525,4.207920792079208
2219031,5,B0007LXOHI,"In 2003, it happened to Sailor Moon.

Last year saw it happen to Yu-Gi-Oh.

This year, DBZ finally gets what it deserves.

The original season.... UNCUT.

All the battles, including the first face-off between Goku and Vegeta, will be restored to their original glory.  No longer will the Z-Senshi ""phase to other dimensions.""  Pointless edits(c'mon... they really had to edit Gohan's TEARS?) will be removed.  And full episodes that had to be taken out(such as an appearance by Launch and Gohan meeting a robot) will be included in the line-up.  My only worry with this set is how the English dub will be handled.  More than likely Funi will take out the original music(the only DB releases where they haven't were the original series and movies.  Z and GT weren't as lucky), but what I'm really wondering is how the voice actors will do dubbing over.  In the original edited releases, despite the bad edits, the VAs were actually quite good(Ian Corlett and Scott McNeil as Goku and Piccolo, respectively, were particularly great).  For the FUNimation actors it has been either hit or miss.  Sometimes they can perform their roles well(The Budokai video games come to mind), but other times they completely fall apart and sound just plain wrong(I hate how the screwed up the end of the Buu saga).  Well, I guess I won't find out until this baby arrives in April, but even if the acting isn't up to par there will still be the original Japanese language track available if necessary.  But either way, I am really looking forward to this DBZ release.  This is the one DBZ DVD ten years in the making.",1108857600,5,1598,4.714801444043322
2219032,5,B0007LXOHI,funimation will have almost released the rest of DBZ on dvd and they just lack the saiyan saga and namek saga(already released in edited form).  i plan on buying this!!!,1108598400,,169,4.633333333333334
2219033,5,B0007LXOHI,The Goku figure I through it in the trash. This box set has the uncut version of Dragonball Z when Vegeta first came to earth with Nappa to steal the Dragon balls. This version has more blood. This is more like a Japanese cartoon.,1132358400,2,230,4.25
2219034,5,B0007LXOHI,"A very good dvd, these uncute dvd's are mutch better then the old one's, the only thing i don't like is 3 episodes on 1 dvd.",1127520000,,124,3.8076923076923075
2219035,4,B0007LXOHI,"The episodes on this disc were actually quite good, it's just nothing major happened, don't get me wrong, it was still good, but just not as good as the Radditz fight. I would recommend you to buy it still as the Vegeta saga as a whole should be awesome, and you don't want your box set to have gaps.

The extra's are nice, the trivias good to watch for the clips, and the original Japanese subtitles and audio are a nice extra, I think it adds to value, because it's interesting to compare it in my opinion. The trailers for other anime are cool as well.

Also this DVD has no annoying bits at the start, or after episodes, like on my futurama DVDs there's those annoying black and white warnings saying the name of a country at the top in red, and you can't skip them.

If you like the Vegeta saga buy this DVD, if you only wanted the high lights of the Vegeta saga still by this DVD as there is some info on these episodes. If you were buying your top 10 sets of 3 DBZ episodes, don't buy this DVD.",1126915200,,1001,4.123076923076923
2219036,4,B0007LXOHI,"Its a good looking art box, with a Goku figure, didn't want that though but well it came with the package.

an point what i find said is there are only 3 episodes on 1 dvd.

i think thats very expensive for only a few eps.

but well im a Dbz fan so i neeeeed it.

in total. its nice.",1124668800,2,283,3.6666666666666665
2219037,2,B0007LXOHI,"This isn't a review on the actual volume... I will say that the episodes are the next set of filler ones, which people who have first watched English DBZ should remember them as episodes 6-7 of the original dub, plus the first half of the full version of episode 8.  Notably Goku does some extra running, we get to see Kuririn contact Tenshinhan and Chaozu about going to Kami's, and Lunch gets to make a brief appearance.

However, FUNimation is still releasing the volumes with 3 episodes only on each disk.  This wouldn't be so bad if they had been releasing 2 volumes like they did in June, but with volume 4 DBZ uncut has gone back to only one volume, which means a petty 3 episodes every 2 freaking months.  Meanwhile, on TV, Cartoon Network has just started the Frieza saga.  Great, and we haven't even gotten to Goku's training on Kaio's planet, let alone the arrival of Vegeta and Nappa on Earth, and from the looks of it we probably won't be seeing those episodes until some time early next YEAR.  Sorry, but with a pathetic release schedule like that I really have to lower my score severely.  FUNimation can do better than this.",1124236800,2,1140,4.504854368932039
2219038,4,B0007LXOHI,"First, the uncut content is really good and the image is not so dated as you may think.then the sound leave breathless,they done an incredible job with the 5.1 soundtrack .don't belive me , look the japennese track to see the difference.the extra are good like the trivia game ,interview and nimbus cloud.the package is well done. I would give this a 5 but it is so expensive for what you get that it only worth 4. Anyway if you are a fan get it",1122681600,2,445,4.247058823529412
2219039,5,B0007LXOHI,"Yes, this is the new release of the Saiyan Saga, (Now called the Vegeta Saga) and it's now ALOT better than it was before. I just recently purchased the DVD on Wed. and it's not just the new re-dubbing, new music, more blood, and all that good stuff, but you get to see a whole bunch of scenes that was originally taken out by Pioneer. Lets put it this way, for those of you who remember the Saiyan Saga, you know that Raditz was dead by the end of the 3rd episode. Well in the new version, they added so many scenes that were originally taken out, that by the end of the third episode, the fight with Raditz had just started. It really is a new experience, even though you've already seen the episode before. To any DBZ fan, I highly recommend purchasing this DVD. It also has alot of really cool bonus features, none of which have ever been seen by any other DBZ DVD, such as interviews, and a fun quiz. Even if your new to the whole Dragonball Z thing, I still highly recommend buying this, because now you can see what started Dragonball Z, ""The way it was meant to be seen.""",1113004800,8,1079,4.217391304347826
2219040,4,B0007LXOHI,"I found this starter set at Best Buy a week before it's supposed to come out.  I would've given it 5 stars, except there were a few things that could have been better.

The good:

All of these episodes are, of course, completely uncut.  They have been remastered with new music and opening/closing sequences.  The new opening features rock music that seems to match well with the series.  There are four audio tracks: English 5.1 surround, English stereo, Japanese mono, and Spanish.  There are also more special features than most other DB/DBZ DVDs, including a 28 minute interview with Chris Sabat (Vegeta, Piccolo) and Sean Schemmel (Goku, King Kai).  The starter set also comes with an exclusive Goku action figure.

The not-so-good:

There are only three episodes on this disc (""The New Threat"", ""Reunions"", and ""Unlikely Alliance"").  Like all of FUNimation's other DB and DBZ episodes, they neglected to include the next-episode previews.  The DBZ trivia could have also been better.  When you select an answer, it just shows a clip of what the question refers to so you can see if you got it right.  When the trivia is finished, it just goes back to the menu.",1112745600,4,1166,4.8232323232323235

8048488,5,B0007LXOHI,WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT LIKES DRAGON BALL Z AND WAS VERY CHEAP AS GREAT OF SHAPE IT WAS IN AND RECIEVED IT ON TIME ALSO,1392076800,,155,3.727272727272727
8048489,5,B0007LXOHI,I like this set. It shows gonna has to be tuff to survive the wilderness. Mr robot's and Mr dinosaur's deaths really help him get stronger.,1360886400,,139,4.384615384615385

8048492,5,B0007LXOHI,"I was excited when this first came out, its the uncut version. I wouldn't waste my money on it though. My reason for that is because in the second vegeta saga set, they discontinued it. Thats because they are making new box sets. Which is great except its going to be in widescreen. So you will be losing 20% of the picture from the top and bottom. It was ment to be seen in full screen. Dont get me wrong i love dragon ball z, just not when you have to buy a million different versions.",1166486400,5,487,4.083333333333333
8048493,4,B0007LXOHI,"I'm a new Dragonball fan and I chose to order this to start my collection off ^^

I have to say that, as I live in England and I could only find this in America, this ended up costing me much much more than I would like to pay for a few short episodes of Anime. Also I was sad to find that I had no choice but to go for the ""free figure"" set - this bumped the price up even more but it worked well as a birthday present for my little brother XD

The Anime episodes are the usual Dragonball style - lots of staring each other down and talking about plans for world conquest with evil looks on their faces, blah blah blah. I was hoping for a lot more action (let's face facts - it's what we watch Dragonball for! XD) but then again this is the first of many in the DBZ series and I can tell that this Anime Boulder has only just started to roll.

So overall a good starter for those wanting to get into Dragonball ^^ ...just be prepared to splash out on the next few DVDs down the line if you want to see some REAL DBZ action >=D",1140912000,,1027,3.880952380952381
