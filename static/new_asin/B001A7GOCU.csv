3445815,5,B001A7GOCU,I love this workout!!  I found the steps really easy to follow unlike many other dance videos I have gotten.  My heart rate was steady and I broke a nice sweat.  The best part is that I had fun.  The bonus is my little girl likes to do it with me.  So we get fit together.  I appreciate being able to do this video in the privacy of my home because I am not a dancer.  I can let loose and I find myself smiling-- and at times laughing (at the thought of what I might look like doing this in front of others!!!)...  This is a definite keeper!  Plus the instructor is great (not annoying at all which is a plus to me) and has a body that keeps me motivated!!!,1218499200,31,657,3.9166666666666665
3445816,4,B001A7GOCU,"As you know, each of the 10 Minute Solution workouts, are 5 segments that are each 10 minutes and are able to be played in any order (I actually like this feature to mix things up a bit and make it a little more interesting).  This is all aerobic and Leah is a friendly instructor and she makes this easy to follow.
All of the moves are taught at half tempo and get faster as you learn them and add on moves.  There really isn't anything drastically new here; it's a lot of grapevines and hip rolls, disco and swing moves.  My two favourite segments are the Simple Slim Down and the Dance Sculpt.
While I find this workout good (because you can do as little as 10 minutes or as much as 50 minutes), this workout is really designed for a beginner exerciser or intermediate at most.  If you are already fit and want a challenge, you won't find it here.  The reason I bought this is for a change of pace and to do light workouts on days where I can't be bothered doing much.  I wouldn't recommend this to advanced exercisers, but others should really reap the benefits of this good workout.",1216857600,62,1087,4.278048780487805

This has been enough for me to stay in shape and maintain my weight.  My goal is to be able to do the whole tape one day, but boy oh boy, I need lots of energy for that.

I like it very much since it's only a short period of time working out. It is fun, sweet and short.
I highly recommend it, you can do 10 mins or more since there are 5 different styles of workout.
My favorite is the ballet one. Good DVD for the price.",1410912000,,354,3.7972972972972974

3445835,5,B001A7GOCU,"Great dance workout! I find myself actually liking to work out with this video and having fun with it. The most challenging part is the last segment- the Ballet Toning. I also take Zumba classes at a gym, but I prefer working out from home.",1408579200,,240,4.355555555555555
3445836,5,B001A7GOCU,I was looking for this type of exercise and so far all of the DVD's I have ordered have been useful.,1392681600,,100,3.8095238095238093
3445837,3,B001A7GOCU,I prefer kid's workouts over adult ones because they are usually the length I want and non-sexual!  That said I do like the 10 minute length choice.,1389225600,,148,4.481481481481482
3445838,3,B001A7GOCU,I bought this as a beginner to start getting in shape. It moves too fast for me and I used to dance but I wasn't able to keep up with the moves in this video. I bought 4 of these types of videos and only liked one of them. I would recommend this for someone that is used to doing aerobic moves.,1383523200,,294,3.7580645161290325
3445839,3,B001A7GOCU,I don't get caught up in queuing or camera angles. Its not an epic motion picture its a work out video... but. In at least one of the segments the camera goes wacky and its disorienting.  Other than that... I can get with her every now and then. Not my first pick however for my workout,1380585600,,286,4.107142857142857
3445840,5,B001A7GOCU,"This is such a fun workout video, not to mention it gives you real cardio workout. I am super sweaty after 10 minutes, and I am not in bad shape. This one is so much fun that I catch my self looking forward to my ""dancing"" which definitely is not the case with most other workouts routines.
I have been using this video for about a year now, and I am loving it even more. You can make workouts more or less challenging and it definitely engages muscles. Even my abs get sore. The ballet workout is a great butt and thigh shaper.
I really do not understand the negative reviews here that are saying this gal does not show the steps enough. She starts so slowly and builds up the routine. I never danced before in my life (other than in disco-clubs ;-)), and I agree that some of the dance moves are challenging, however that only makes it more fun to me.",1377302400,,853,4.2073170731707314
3445841,3,B001A7GOCU,"Leah Sarago is a fun instructor but she moves quickly. I expected that with the workouts being only ten minutes each but still you basically need to be a dancer to keep up with her. It's a good workout but half the time I was struggling to keep up and I'm not out of shape. I've bought a few exercise DVDs and nobody can come close to Jillian Michaels, I recommend her workouts for anyone.",1369699200,,389,4.2
3445842,5,B001A7GOCU,Great easy workout. I think this is easy to follow and I have No dance experience other Thanks doing zumba here and there. I love how you can set up the work out to be as Long as you want it and in whatever order you want as well.,1368576000,,230,3.7142857142857144
3445843,3,B001A7GOCU,This is not a real workout.  I did it and did not break a sweat.  I gave it to my 8 year old to workout.,1366588800,2,104,3.12
3445844,4,B001A7GOCU,"A lot of the moves are ones I'm very familiar with having taken a lot of kickboxing and hi-low aerobics classes.  Getting back to exercising regularly after having twins, I think this is a good start.  It does get my heart rate up, but I remember doing these moves in classes years ago and thinking it wasn't challenging enough after a while.  I wouldn't think this dvd is for those beyond intermediate at any point.  For those looking for something beyond beginner level, you can make it intermediate by ""powering up"" the movements adding more bounces/hops.  In that regard, it's good for beginners to intermediate as you can modify based on your fitness level.  It's good also in that those looking for low impact can easily modify for their needs by staying grounded.

As for those noting it's hard to follow, I ask aren't all routines that are new to you hard to follow at first?  It takes a few times.  So I, for one, am ok with the level of explanation.  Too much explanation after you've done it a few times gets monotonous.

I have two other 10 Minute Solutions dvds, Fat Blasting Dance Mix with Jennifer Galardi, and Slim and Sculpt Pilates with Bands, but this one is my favorite so far.  Love the 10 minute set up.  Makes it seem to go by faster.",1363219200,,1257,4.484581497797357
3445845,5,B001A7GOCU,Very fun and energetic! Easy to keep up to and anyone can do it! It's a steal for the price. I really like that the instructor is energetic but not too annoying when she teaches. It's great for busy people such as full time students like me! It's also very feminine and arrived a day early. Recommended!,1362441600,,303,4.333333333333333
3445846,5,B001A7GOCU,This is an excellent video.  The 10 minute routines are easy to learn and provide a great workout.  I love the fact that I am able to customize the workout.,1362009600,,156,4.166666666666667
3445851,1,B001A7GOCU,"I love the 10 minute solution dvds usually but this one is just awful.  The instructor goes way too fast and barely demonstrates the moves.  The moves also change rapidly.  I think one of the things that bugged me most is the instructor's incessant fast talking.  She never stops.  And like another reviewer stated I didn't feel any real work out.  The flirty workout is actually more stripperish than flirty.  My recommendation is to stick with Jennifer Gilardi and Kristin Jacobs--they are really good instructors and you get a good workout.  I hope they do more 10 minute dvds.

I am adding an addendum--the last two workouts (Swing and Ballet) on the dvd are actually good and finally got me breathing which makes me feel better though I am glad I didn't pay anywhere near full price for this.",1357948800,2,797,4.676258992805756
3445852,5,B001A7GOCU,She teaches dance moves while incorporating a good workout.  It is time well spent.  I would definitely recommend this workout.,1355270400,,127,5.3
3445853,4,B001A7GOCU,"I really like this video. What I like about the 10 minute videos is that it feels like you're done really quickly, even if you do 3-4 because each seem totally different due to the instructor wearing different outfits and there's a short warm up and cool down for each one. You sort of trick yourself into thinking that it was really fast so you keep on going. But if you don't, studies have shown that even 10 minutes help! One thing I've found with this particular video is that certain steps focus on only one side, so I just try doing the opposite side for a few of the reps-working the brain as well!  I like the instructor and the moves-she's positive and the moves are easy to follow.  They are somewhat like the ""light hits"" on certain radio stations vs. the rock stations, however, they do get me sweating and feeling good.  It is a workout I return to on a regular basis.  Finally, how can you beat the price?? Consider what one workout costs in the gym and even if you use this only once it's a 3rd to a 4th of the cost of one class.",1352419200,,1044,4.205
3445854,3,B001A7GOCU,"I got this thinking it would be better, but it wasn't.  I have a better video where there's an instructor plus 3 other individuals along with her.  This one just has the instructor.  It seems a bit ridiculous to only watch her doing the steps.  I like more people involved.
Plus the workout doesn't get me as sweaty as zumba or my other video.  This one is ok if you don't have anything else and just want to get a bit of exercise in.  A more detailed exercise dvd is needed if your looking for a better workout. Also the steps are kinda hard to follow and she moves a bit too fast.  A demonstration would have been nice.",1347321600,,621,4.168067226890757
3445855,1,B001A7GOCU,I love the 10 minute solution series. I did not like this dvd. I did not like the instructor. I did not like the fact that I wasted money on this and I will NEVER do it because she is annoying and the moves are dumb. That is all.,1335830400,2,229,3.693877551020408
3445856,3,B001A7GOCU,"I'm a huge fan of the 10 minute videos.  But after doing this one once, it blew a blood vessel in my foot, caused it to swell up, and it's purple.  I ended up at the doctor where he said I ""traumatized the heck out of it"".  I didn't think it was that bad while doing it but apparently something didn't like me - I suspect the ballet part.  Love the other 10 minute DVDs I've tried though.",1333584000,,388,3.9358974358974357
3445857,4,B001A7GOCU,Some very good workouts and love the body sculpting too.  Easy to follow and get in shape wit this DVD.,1328572800,,103,4.15
3445858,1,B001A7GOCU,"OK, background first- I am 40 & not exactly in the best shape of my life. Halfway through the workouts I am still breathing normally. If you're gonna burn fat in 10 minutes, you gotta do interval training, & this is just 10 minutes of basic cardio. Not what I expect from 10 Minute Solution. Disappointing. Recommend Keli Roberts & the original 10 Minute Solution.",1322956800,,364,4.615384615384615
3445859,1,B001A7GOCU,"I was hopeful for this, like others in the series. Just starts with no instruction and that is not helpful for someone just starting out. perhaps if you are already familiar with modern dances it would be a better fit.",1297296000,2,218,4.475
3445860,2,B001A7GOCU,"I just finished trying this video; and I'm so disappointed, I went right to the computer to let people know! I've done about a dozen  dance dvd's, and I wish I could return this one.  It's SOO repetitious! It's repetitious within each segment AND from one segment to the next.
  Within each segment, when Leah introduces each step she has you repeat it about six times. After she's introduced 2 or 3 steps, she repeats those in sequence maybe six times. Then she introduces the second group of steps and does the same thing.  When you're at 7 minutes (out of the ten), you know all the steps and keep repeating the sequence for the last 2 and a half minutes, until the brief cool-down. Once in a while a step is tricky, and you might appreciate the practice, but most steps are fairly simple.
  Anyway you'll usually have plenty of chances to learn the steps, because of the segment to segment repetition. Every segment has some version of squats or plies, triple steps, hip circles, grapevines and probably a hop.  The arm movements change, and can be cute; but the legwork just isn't imaginative. If you've done any dance videos, you've done these steps--but thankfully not this MUCH of them.

I'd like to edit my review after doing the dvd more. The ""retro"" segments (2 of the 5) now seem more unusual and fun, and I've found that other ""10-Minute Solutions"" dvd's are just as repetitious. Maybe the instructors feel they don't have enough time to introduce many steps so they often end up with too few; about half of each segment is repetition.",1290988800,6,1548,4.6
3445861,4,B001A7GOCU,"Nice video...kind of hard to get the moves down the first couple times, but once you get them down and put in more effort yourself, its a decent workout.",1278892800,,153,4.310344827586207
3445862,2,B001A7GOCU,"I forgot that the 10 minute solution series have really cheesy music, it so bad that I really don't use this DVD. The instructor is good, her moves are interesting and fun but the music just ruins it for me. If generic 80's synth music doesn't bother you then you may dig this DVD.",1278201600,2,281,4.222222222222222
3445863,4,B001A7GOCU,"This is my first time with 10 minute solutions videos. I like how I can switch up which workout I do. Honestly, the 10 minutes went by really quickly. The only problems I had was that when I wanted to go back to the menu and select just one workout, It wouldn't let me do it. I noticed that they don't provide a real warm-up ( or I just like mine longer) or cool down, so I had to find a different way for those.",1268179200,5,412,3.8588235294117648

3445865,5,B001A7GOCU,I have lost weight since I began using this dvd!  I love the upbeat workouts and how it is switched up from one segment to the next.  It never gets boring!  I will definitely continue to use this to Dance off the pounds!!!,1258243200,3,222,4.116279069767442
3445866,4,B001A7GOCU,"I just bought this and am still learning, but I like it.  I am not a natural at dancing.  It is a challenge for me to learn steps.  I'm also not 20 years old, and there are some dance videos that have a little too much jumping (hard on the knees) for me.  This one is good for getting the heart rate up without killing my joints.  I bought the Latin dance video from 10 Minute Solution and finally learned to do all of it, so thought I'd order this one for variety.  I think once I've got the steps down, I'm really going to enjoy it.",1255564800,3,534,3.94392523364486
3445867,5,B001A7GOCU,"Easy to follow moves, but enough variety to keep things interesting,and keep you working.  The instructor does a wonderful job - she's not annoying at all, as opposed to so many other instructors (why are they all so annoying?!).  This is the one DVD I go to over and over again.",1255046400,,279,4.450980392156863
3445868,2,B001A7GOCU,"I was excited to try this as a few reviews were fairly positive. I put the DVD in the player and all of a sudden this Paris Hilton wannabe stands in front of the camera posing for every syllable. It was difficult to take and going further than that would have been cruel torture as this gal doesn't have much of a personality that seems genuine. She is a good dancer, I'll give her that and keeping up was difficult, but that is only because I am not a dancer. I am sure somebody could get a lot out of this DVD if they can get past her and the personality that she was trying to portray. All I know is, for me, in my opinion, I can tell if somebody is really wanting to make a difference in the lives of the viewer by getting them into shape and/or lose weight or if they are just in it to make a buck and stand there looking pretty for the camera. If it's not real and genuine, it's not for me.",1253836800,5,896,3.955801104972376
3445869,4,B001A7GOCU,"This has 5 ten min. workouts of different styles.
Flashback - more 70s
Flirty - more sensual
Cardio Swing - Charleston theme
Dance sculpt - more lower body dance toning/ballet

Leah is friendly, relaxed like working out with a gf and shows any complex moves in it's most simplified style so it's very easy to follow. She also either moves a bit stiffly due to simplified style of dance or to make it easier to follow which is my only complaint. This is a more relaxed, easy dance tempo, so it should be easy to keep up for beginners. I doubt this would really cause weight loss unless you have a lot to lose or always do the whole 50 at once.

I really love this now and its one of my favourite dance dvds.  A bit complicated at first but once you get the hang of it is more interesting than other dance dvds which become boring after a while.

3445871,5,B001A7GOCU,"This DVD is a definite keeper and has become part of my regular rotation.  The choreography is simple enough to follow easily, yet provides enough variety to hold my interest.  Once I start this workout, the time flies and it's over before I know it.

As with all of the 10 Minute Solutions, it is divided into five convenient segments.  You can choose only one, or all five if you have the time.  The five dance workouts on this DVD are:

*Simple Slim Down
*Fat Blasting Flashback
*Flirty Fat Burner
*Cardio Swing Dance
*Dance Sculpt

I recommend this DVD to anyone looking for dance routines that are fun to do, yet provide a good cardio workout.",1241049600,9,648,4.5344827586206895
3445872,5,B001A7GOCU,This is a great dance workout. I love how this workout makes you feel like you are are not working out. I definitely broke a sweat- this is a good moderate cardio workout. The moves are so fun and flirty! Leah's dance sculpt segment is great too! The series of plies and arabesques make you feel dancer like!,1239235200,2,308,4.327586206896552
3445873,5,B001A7GOCU,"This is a great DVD for a number of reasons.  The 10-minute segments fit into any schedule, each one is challenging enough to get your heart pumping and make a difference as a stand-alone workout, the DVD also allows you to string together segments anyway that you choose, the instructor is cute, well-dressed, and not annoying, and because the dance routines are challenging to perform and learn, you won't get easily bored.  Now, I am not a great dancer, and I have a hard time moving really quickly, but by doing each workout repeatedly I am slowly learning the moves and getting a great workout.  Even if you aren't good at dancing, if you stick with it, you'll learn the moves and get BETTER at dancing.",1235347200,3,708,4.603174603174603

The different dance segments are great to do to change up the workout. IT is a great cardio workout. The dance sculpt segment was my favorite! I could feel my muscles really working. I like the sculpting segment so much that I bought her other DVD, Release, and it is sculpting combined with cardio-and it is my favorite right now. I will definitely keep using this workout DVD for cardio. Leah Sarago's upbeat personality keeps you going! This is a must have workout DVD!",1235088000,3,591,4.5327102803738315

3445876,2,B001A7GOCU,"OK -- I admit it.  I'm playing fashion police.  This otherwise excellent dance workout DVD suffers because of a MAJOR bactarian wardrobe issue in the first workout segment.  Other than that (and I find it difficult to get past) the workouts are fun, short, and not too difficult.  Workouts 2-5 are good, and I do not find it difficult to watch the leader in those.

3445877,5,B001A7GOCU,"I really, really like this one.  I especially like the swing dance.  The instructor is right on and the dances are very well organized.  They seem to flow together well and leave alot of room to have fun while I'm sweating.  One of my favorites, and would like to see another one from this instructor.",1231286400,,301,4.418181818181818
3445878,4,B001A7GOCU,"I am a big fan of the 10 minute solution series. I own over a dozen of them. I really enjoyed the segments in this one. It was fun to do the moves, I only found a few of them a little difficult at first. I especially liked the Sculpt segment because it was a lot of moves that we actually do in ballet class and it actually felt like a workout not just dancing about. The reason this did not get a five stars is because of the instructor. She is very breathy and kind of ""sings"" out the steps. So kind of have to ignore that and just enjoy the moves. Good video overall.",1228694400,,570,3.9224137931034484
3445879,5,B001A7GOCU,"It's a great DVD. If you're a fan of dance workouts, this is for you. It's fun and energetic. If you are a beginner, start with something easier, probably not a 10 Minute Solution, they're always fast-paced.",1224460800,2,207,4.621621621621622
3445880,5,B001A7GOCU,"Let me first say that this is the first dance dvd I have done and I have two left feet.  That being said, I had a blast with this dvd!  I found the moves to be easy to catch on to and I loved the different themes, my favorite being the swing cardio.  I liked the instructor, too.  This is a fun workout that didn't wear me out.  I really like this one and will be implementing it a lot.",1220745600,20,386,3.775
8276256,1,B001A7GOCU,It arrived brand new in the packaging but the disc was unreadable to due to some kind of off color substance all over the reading side of the disc. I took screen cleaner to it to no avail.,1518220800,,188,3.973684210526316

8276262,3,B001A7GOCU,"I bought this hoping to replace my salsa dance workout that i seem to have lost...but I was disappointed in the video content. The moves were awkward and not appropriate for a ""mature"" woman such as myself. I didn't want my teenage boys walking in the room and seeing me do that workout!  It may be a great workout for a dance lover, but I prefer something a little more athletic and challenging. I would not have even broke a sweat. Maybe this would be good for a recovery day.",1449792000,,478,4.311111111111111
8276263,5,B001A7GOCU,"Very fun.  I would buy more 10 minute solution videos with Leah Sarago.  I like the way she presents the dances and constantly recaps until you have the entire dance down without any problem, all the while getting a very nice work-out!",1446076800,,235,4.571428571428571
