2730294,3,B000MGBLFU,"It's more of a thinking persons movie.  The subject matter is scary, to go into a hospital to have a simple procedure done and wake up to find out that they did major surgery on you due to a patient chart mix up.  I don't really know why this movie has an Unrated Version, uther than for the increased sells.  Their doesn't seem to be anything too extreme in this version to bypass the R rating but I bought the Unrated Version anyway.  Rent this one first and don't let the cover fool you, there is no slasher running around a hospital killing people.",1173744000,6,552,4.278846153846154

2730308,3,B000MGBLFU,"This movie was okay. It was a little confusing to me. I thought that it would have went in a different direction than it did. I must admit that I enjoyed seeing Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs again, though.",1411862400,,198,4.527777777777778
2730309,5,B000MGBLFU,Great movie...very very scary and disturbing.  Only problem everyone I know loves to borrow it. May need another copy. Great movie for those who prefer plot over gore in their horror movies.,1397606400,,190,4.9375
2730310,4,B000MGBLFU,"I wouldn't say it was the best movie ever, but definitely not as bad as the ratings imply.  If you're looking for a truly scary movie, this is not the one for you.  It is not so much scary as eerie and strange.  The best comparison I can make is Twin Peaks.  If you were a fan of that show, you would probably like the pacing and atmosphere of this movie.",1386633600,,355,3.9577464788732395
2730311,3,B000MGBLFU,"This film, about a man who goes into a hospital for surgery only to be given the wrong operation due to a mistake, has a dreamy quality reminiscent of the Twilight Zone TV series. We are constantly going back and forth between what appears to be reality and dream sequences, or memories of the patient's past experiences. There is a leisurely quality to the film which might drive some crazy, but I felt that it enhanced the dreamy quality of the film. If the film has a weak spot for me it was towards the end which lost some of its intrigue for the sake of a moralistic tone which seemed a bit heavy handed. This film is very well acted and directed, though it does seem to be lacking somewhat in brilliance.",1382572800,,710,4.345864661654136
2730312,2,B000MGBLFU,"This movie has many layers to it and the director and writer spend almost 2 hours trying to piece the layers together into a coherent story of George's (Cavanagh) life/ordeal through flashbacks/memories and so on. The story is slow paced and borders on the bizarre at times throughout the movie. At his 40th birthday party the day before his colonoscopy his family and friends tell him of the horrors of medical mistakes and it puts George's mind in overdrive with worries. Well you know what happens and it sets off a chain reaction of bizarre events that plague George and his family. For those who are looking for medical accuracy, you'll find plenty of liberties taken on the medical side of the story and they stray from what would be considered standard practices. The acting is good, but the direction, writing and pacing take from what could have been a great movie and turns it into an average movie.

Rating 0 to 5 stars

Story = 3 It was to slow paced and gets bizarre at times.
Direction = 2.5 I felt the director and writer tried to cram to much into the story and the pacing and lengh of time hurt the movie.
Acting = 4 Was very good across the board with primary and secondary characters.
Suspence/tension = 3.7 This movie has both and its palatable.
Violence = Yes, but not over the top nor very graphic.
Gore = 3+ Some scenes of surgery and torture.
Sex/Nudity = Yes, but only the back of Zoe's (Coiro) upper torso.
Foul Language = Yes, all the big 4 letter ones, but not in every sentence.
Entertainment Value = 2 to 3 stars. Its slow paced and almost 2 hours long without a lot of action. It may be hard to follow for some with its bizarre scenes and storyline.",1379808000,4,1680,4.433656957928803
2730313,4,B000MGBLFU,"I saw this movie years ago when it first came out a d decided to buy it for a penny when I found it on amazon. It provides a third person perspective of a bizarre journey into the subconscious psyche of a man in a coma.
It definitely provides a twist and leaves you left wondering what's real...",1373241600,,295,4.103448275862069
2730314,4,B000MGBLFU,"The movie is not perfect for reasons mentioned but it is deep and thought provoking enough to want to read other people's take and that alone is worthwhile. I say 'Sopranos' because there was a sequence when Tony gets shot and we live inside his coma for about 4 episodes. Man that was some of the finest T.V. ever. Only there his children and  wife reach him. But it was scary in a way this is. 'Why can't our Creator save us from this lost land?' Or is that Purgatory? Some might say 'there is no Creator' Others might say indeed 'there is' but 'G-D does not work the way you do, like in this.",1369785600,,595,4.173913043478261
2730325,5,B000MGBLFU,"I've found the entire Raw Feed series a hoot. I was especially pleased with the outrageous humor of ""Otis"" and the endearing ""Twilight Zone""-esque quality of ""Believers."" The Raw Feed folks have put together some very fine features on time-and-money shoestrings (reminiscent of the production efforts in FX's legendary series, ""The Shield."") I think ""Sublime"" is the best of the Feed lot (sorry).

If you're looking for Teen Horror and Slasher schtick, ""Sublime"" will disappoint. However, if you would like another treat from the ""Jacob's Ladder"" box of goodies, enjoy this satisfying confection.",1364083200,,596,5.408602150537634
2730326,5,B000MGBLFU,"This was a very strange and interesting movie. I don't remember it being advertised or seeing a trailer for it. It's like a best kept secret. Very interesting story telling of a man who goes into the hospital for a procedure, ends up in a coma, never wakes up, but in his mind he is awake and having a nightmare he can't wake up from until he lets go. Definitely not for the faint of heart, or those who get grossed out easily. But if you like sitting on the edge of your seat...this movie is for you.",1358726400,7,501,4.122448979591836
2730327,5,B000MGBLFU,Wow...I never expected what I got.  This is not the typical horror movie or scary type. . .this is all mental and it is excellent.  I enjoyed it and passed it on to some of my friends who said the same.  The end is superb.  I would recommend this DVD...don't pass it up.,1353628800,,270,4.037735849056604

2730329,1,B000MGBLFU,"Oh Tom Cavanaugh - how much I respect you. That being said - I already wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching this director's totally murky view of several opinions (thus giving me the right to continue my rant about the complete and infuriating hubris that those self involved jerks in Hollywood actually think average America, who pays good money for these movies, who just want to have FUN, actually CARE what these self-involved morons think about local/national/world politics and whatever political view of said Hollywood big ego wants to share with us) he wants to convey. I won't waste any more of my time reviewing this terrible mess of a movie. YAY for you highbrows who think you know better than we, the movie-goers and thus money spenders do and are trying to educate us to expand our tiny view of the world. As for the rest of us dumb heads who simply pay your salaries, we'll continue to vote with our feet and go to the ENTERTAINING movies and in the end, we win because you get terrible votes and nobody goes to see your garbage. Sorry I didn't go into what this loser was about, don't really want to relive it again. And please? Put DRAMA as category for movies like this? The only HORROR was wasting my time watching this loser!",1348963200,2,1250,4.535398230088496
2730330,4,B000MGBLFU,"I had to watch this movie just to see what the hospital screwed up and I agree with the other reviews the genera is not correct. I wouldn't call it a horror movie. Its more of a thought provoking psychological thriller or psychological something or another would be more appropriate. Very well done movie, acting was superb. The ending was worth the wait. It was similar to other movies I have seen but this was more realistic.",1347753600,,427,4.558441558441558
2730331,2,B000MGBLFU,"Sublime tries to be an intelligent suspense but instead it's one of those ""Oh, this is really boring and confusing until the very end when everything finally wraps up and makes sense"" type films.  The problem is, it's not suspenseful at all, and all comments about it being deeply disturbing and properly executing the fear of hospitals/surguries -despite a few emotional scene when the man first discovers that something is wrong- are all fairly exaggerated.

The story- a man goes into a hospital to get a colonoscopy but it turns out that when moved to another floor, the doctos perform the wrong surgery unbeknownst to the patient until he wakes up and finds some of his other body parts have been removed.  Sounds intriguing and suspenseful so far, right?

Then... a female nurse enters the room.  A sexy female nurse.  This is the point when the film goes downhill and never again recovers (though there's a brief recovery period later on when the man awakes and finds his daughter kissing another girl beside his bed along with an interesting trip down memory lane involving a story that he once said to his daughter).  Anyway about the nurse.  The problem is not only that she's attractive enough to be a porn star, but the actual pacing and atmosphere almost *changes* into a pornographic environment, and with a man lying there in a hospital bed recovering from the WRONG surgery... this is beyond terrible writing.  From here,  thoughts and dreams of his wife having sex with other people in the hospital enter the mans head while the sexy nurse is pushing the man around in a wheelchair in an attempt to dig up secretive information about his botched surgery.  Oh man this is brutal to watch.

Another moment of interest appears when the patient tries to defend his case to his lawyer and to the other hospital workers at a meeting room, only to discover that he's not allowed to leave the hospital.  By this point I'm wondering why the mans wife isn't feeling any kind of fear or sadness or *any* kind of emotion whatsoever- she just sits by and hears the doctors having a conversation but never steps in to defend her husband.  This should send a red flag concerning the ending of the movie, and... it did.  Perhaps the writers should have included the REAL emotional way that a wife would respond to such an unfortunate incident when they discover their husband received the wrong surgery?  That would have given a boost to the conclusion and would've surprised viewers at least a *little* more.  Still, none of this excuses what I consider a lousy story overall and several moments of aimless, uninteresting/unsuspenseful writing.

The problem is that Sublime would have worked sooooo much better had it focused on the patient waking up from a botched surgery and kept the emotional side in full swing instead of trying to wrap a confusing and unnecessary, barely adequate and relatable story around it.  It didn't though.  Instead... well, without giving away what happens, it ends up being a disappointment.",1341532800,4,3025,4.81431334622824
2730332,5,B000MGBLFU,"The bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Sublime (unrated),"" a direct to DVD movie. Well, the ratings and comments on this one were all over the place with the highest number of reviewers giving it one star. I was almost hesitant to put it on, yet a few people thought it was a really good movie. I'm in agreement with them, but I can easily understand the spread in ratings. This movie is not easy to watch or understand. It plays with your mind and you have to pay attention or you'll lose it. Once you've lost it, there's probably no way to get back.

The movie is presented as a collage of scenes. Past, present, future, dreams, fears. lusts, prejudices and longings are all intermixed and pass by in set after set. It's up to your own mind to put it all together. Believe me, not everyone will be up to the task and they'll end up thinking it's a lousy movie. It's not. It's excellent! It's billed as a horror movie, but I would say it's much more of a complex mental exercise. Sure, there are some horrible things in it, but that doesn't make it a horror movie. The acting is quite good. The photography is good. The sound is a little too intrusive, in my opinion. But all in all, it's a well done movie.

The main plot is centered about a man who is having a birthday party (about # 40) and is scheduled for a colonoscopy in the immediate future. Of course, that's going to plant a certain number of fears into anyone's mind. As he is getting prepped, he finds out that his Doctor is an Iranian. Now, how would you feel about having an Iranian do a colonoscopy on you? Then, almost all of us feel uneasy about hospitals in the first place, but everything is going wrong in this particular one. And the anxiety builds ever higher. Added to the scene is a beautiful nurse and the anxiety builds in a different direction. Then add an Afro-American male nurse with a cold and cruel demeanor to arouse a few deep-seated racial prejudices. Then have the patient changed to another room where he undergoes the wrong procedure by the wrong physician. Add a few highly negative discussions about the American health-care system and it's shortcomings. Slip in a few of his fear-ridden dreams while under sedation. Now, stir all of those scenes, and a lot of others, into an almost randomly-presented movie and you'll have something that will glue you to the TV screen. Don't leave, not for an instant. Get the snacks there first. Make sure you've peed. Don't converse. Settle back and watch a five-star movie unfold in all it's horror.

2730333,5,B000MGBLFU,"I loved this movie! The acting was excellent and the script itself was magnificent. The Lead Actor did a great job! Kudos to the lead actor. Although i do not know his name, i have seen him before playing other roles and his performance in this movie was quite impressive. !!!!!!!!!! I will definitely be watching this movie many, many times overin the years to come !!!!!!!!!!!!!",1331251200,,380,4.686567164179104
2730334,5,B000MGBLFU,"I ordinarily don't write reviews but this movie absolutely positively blew me away.  I had no idea it was classified as horror but it was terrifying and disturbing and completely amazing.  The cast is absolutely unbelievable in bringing writers vision to life.  I consider myself very jaded w regards to psychological thrillers or dramas, esp when they attempt to grapple w life and death and comas and primal fear.  I was transfixed through this whole movie and never once felt it was overly cliche.  Certainly didn't feel it was too long.  I only hope the writers/producers make another movie soon but it would be tough in my mind to top this one.  Really tough.",1305590400,,664,4.771929824561403
2730335,5,B000MGBLFU,"To be honest I saw the cover online and figured I'd check the film out.
And that and the summary on the DVD box throw expectations completely off.

I though I was going to see some gory, sadistic, sex filled, strange fest.
And ended up watching a film which evoked thought and threw a little depth in the world of entertainment.
Sometimes anxiety can be exceedingly worse than reality.
One may be at the mercy of a myriad of factors, but one is the master of one;s mind and spirit.
Improvement of self is always possible.

Usually I am a fan of mindless entertainment but sometimes little gems like this are a welcome refresher.

If you are a health care worker, this movie will freak you out I bet.  I don't want to give it away, but the ending really (really) made me think about things I don't want to think about...and again if you are in health care you will know what I am talking about, because you have wondered this very thing, and probably never came to a satisfactory answer...",1297641600,3,481,4.404494382022472
2730337,5,B000MGBLFU,"A great quirky horror/ dark comedy that keeps you guessing, ""Is it real or his imagination?""

The creators of this movie have nothing to be ashamed of. What I liked least was the DVD cover design. They didn't put much into that. If you like the Twilight Zone and Coen brothers and B horror movies, then get it.",1277510400,,310,4.344827586206897
2730338,5,B000MGBLFU,"i think if you look at the people who did not like this film it would be a checklist for the mentally disabled.  this is not a horror film, even though it has many horror elements to it. this is a movie that should make you think.  about life.........about death. i won't bother trying to sum it up as the screenwriter did so brilliantly.  the only thing that i would add is that as i was watching it i was drawn to my thoughts on euthanasia. this is what the movie is really about.  the whole movie is sumed up in the scene where the wife wants to do what she believes in her heart is the right thing. the schiavo case comes to mind. no one knows what is really going on in these cases.  we think they are brain dead........but are they? i would not want to live if it were me in that situation.  make sure you have a living will.  maybe this could be you someday.",1258329600,3,865,4.052941176470588
2730339,3,B000MGBLFU,This movie makes you scared to go to the Doctors. I thought there would be more blood and gore. The scene is set in a hospital where a man goes through a emotional rollercoaster of mental fear. Basically Nightmare on Elm Street meets ER.,1256515200,,237,4.409090909090909
2730340,5,B000MGBLFU,"I have never seen a movie quite like Sublime before.  I am a fan of the Horror and Psychological Thriller genres.  I am a fan of Lynch and Cronenburg.  Sublime kept me on the edge of my seat for two hours.  It didn't drag or seem long to me.  The sound track is phenomenal.  I went to bed and dreamed of fearful things.  I had a spiritual experience in my dream and awoke with an epiphany.  This movie affected me deeply.  I'm thinking of attaching a copy of the DVD to my living will.  It is definately for the thinking film viewer.  The only thing I am left wondering about are the interviews in the extras section.  The person interveiwing the film makers is almost inaudible.  The responses by the film makers are often repeated and there appears to have been no real editing.  It's hard to believe that with all the care and thought taken to make this movie that they would forget to edit the interviews.  However, I can't think of a reason they would do them this way on purpose.  Does anyone who likes this film have an explaination for that?  Despite this, I reccomend watching the interview but only AFTER viewing the film.  Sublime is a real beauty and the title is apt.",1256342400,4,1180,4.359447004608295

The packaging of the DVD cover really made me wonder, If I would enjoy this movie as it seemed very different from most of the films that he has starred in. However, my expectations were not disappointed!  This is a great film!  The acting by ALL actors was just great!  I had to watch the movie twice and listen to the commentary to really understand what the movie was about.  Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs was of course fantastic!  His character although not one of the main characters, nonetheless will leave a memorable and lasting image, and impact on the viewer.

2730343,1,B000MGBLFU,"First off, this is NOT a horror movie! It's a metaphoric mess! The entire movie is displayed in puzzles & riddles. The best way to describe this mess is, ""It's like reading an abstract poem & trying to figure it out"". The movie is VERY SLOW & to someone who does not understand metaphors will truly hate it. I truly understand metaphoric movies but this one was not executed well at all, very boring & not creative, I Truly hated every minute of it. The message of this movie has already been made before with other titles, clearly making it not original. The movie keeps advancing from a birthday party to a hospital, a birthday party to a hospital, a birthday party to a hospital, I think you get the point. I could not wait for this movie to end. I found this mess in a dump bin & I guess, dump bin clearly means that. The interviews were a joke as well, unprofessional & the sound quality was lacking,... editing, what editing, who ever edited the interviews should have eliminated the questions that were asked in a very low audio level & when the interviewee was asked to repeat his answer that as well was not edited, you hear the answer twice in some spots. Overall this movie was a mess, a complete disaster & I feel many of the reviewers on Amazon feel the same way as I do.

2730344,4,B000MGBLFU,"SOME MINOR SPOILERS. Just a short review of this film. It is exceptionally deep at multiple levels.  As the screen writer's review pointed out, it delves into the Everyman's fears, and does so in the context of the comma.  It makes one really think about chronic vegatative states and consiousness. The intro (a falling to the ground dream sequence) folds in quite eloguently with the ending of the film.
The acting is very good. Welome Back Kotter's Lawarence Hilton Jacobs.... you will never think of him in the same way after seeing this film. There are multiple levels of symbolism in the film as well...social, political, racial, and even biblical/religious.  Being a person that is very interested in medicine and the profession,in general,  I particularly enjoyed one of the subthemes dealing with insurance and the hospital industry.
The symbolism in the film is plentiful. For example, the religious references to the 12 apostles, the Last Supper, Judas.  It is a horror film for a very intellegent audience. Even objects like the knife holder serve to foster the film's use of symbolic references.  Hats off to the entire writing and screen writing team.  If you enjoyed Jacob's Ladder, you will enjoy this film as well....The atmosheric environments, particularly those in the hosptial, are very effective and visceral.
One warning: the film is quite graphic (I saw the UNRATED version) and this may offend certain viewers.",1241308800,2,1434,5.102564102564102

2730356,1,B000MGBLFU,"This movie was totally new to me.  I found it in a video store and bought it because I was looking for a horror movie I hadn't seen and because Paget Brewster was in it.  Unlike most movies, I didn't research it before watching it.  I hoped I'd stumbled onto some overlooked indie gem.

Unfortunately, not the case. I can't find many good things to say about this one.  I'm not even sure I got the point, and an hour into it I really didn't care anymore.  The horror genre is in serious trouble these days and films like this are not helping.  In these times of terrible remakes, even worse imitations, and stars who can in some cases barely even be called actors, horror needs to be original and tread new ground, while still incorporating the tried and true cinematic devices of days gone by.  This film has an original idea (that's only assuming I correctly understood the message as being the corruption and incompetence of the medical profession and the complacence of those in charge of it), but did nothing outstanding with that idea.  It just meanders along for 117 minutes, tossing in everything from anti-racism tirades to internet streaming documentary-style footage of weird South American medical procedures ala Cannibal Holocaust.

I'm not sure who the target audience is supposed to be.  The gore scenes looked as if they were aimed at those who like so-called ""torture porn"" but I doubt there is enough gore to please that crowd.  It wasn't paced fast enough and had far too little action to please lovers of slasher films or conspiracy films.  And, it's too cryptic and ambiguous to please those looking for a thinking man's horror film (which is what I really think it IS purporting to be).

Paget Brewster is totally wasted in this piece of grunge.  She has maybe 8 minutes of actual screen time.  I realize she wasn't top-billed, but she is the only well-known person in the movie (unless you count John Rubinstein who also doesn't do much here).  You don't even get to see her except in the background.  I just think that when attractive people like this are cast in films like this, they should be made better use of.  She's the type you'd like to see as a lead, not a part of the background.  Hell, she doesn't even get to play a victim here!

I can't really recommend this movie to anyone.  The cover art is more titillating than anything in the movie, and that interesting tree tattoo doesn't even figure into the story very much.  It's on the cute nurse's back, but has no other meaning.  She calls it the Tree of Life, but why?  This entire film is just dull and boring.  No other way to describe it.

A word of warning: don't let junk like this deter you from checking out independent films, or you might end up missing something really good, like 2002's ""MAY.""  Now THAT was a respectable piece of independent film-making.

And if you want to see a good medical conspiracy movie, ""Coma"" still packs a punch even though it is 30 or so years old.",1233100800,6,2973,4.556603773584905

This was one of the worst movies ever made by anyone.  It was soooo slow, predictable, racist, sexist, and basically just not interesting.  We really tried to watch it but ultimately just fast forwarded through.  And the only reason we did that instead of turning it off was b/c while we were watching we read a funny review on the internet and so we had to see the final scene and how the guy was ultimately put out of his misery.  AND, we HAD to keep watching so we could see and laugh at Freddie Boom Boom Washington's (actor from Welcome Back Kotter) silly gore attempted scenes.  Freddie was fine, it was his material that was so bad.

I can't believe this movie was labeled science fiction...NOT- and a really stupid horror attempt.  I think they threw the horror aspect in there at the last minute when they realized the sci-fi theme wasn't really working.  The Amazon reviewer who says he was involved with this movie seems to somewhat sheepishly defend this movie.  He talks about subtle points they tried to make.  Well, guess what...they missed. No one got any of those points and no one watching could care a less either.  Also, why give away what is happening so early?  Don't assume your audience is stupid.  And, PLEASE- has anyone that was involved with the movie even been to a hospital lately?  I don't recall seeing nurses wearing short white dresses, high heels and stockings... It would have been scarier if they had tried to make his experience in the hospital SOMEWHAT realistic.  If the sexy nurse is absolutely necessary to the plot (??) then only show the ultimate male fantasy nurse when he was delusional and comatose; that could have been the subtle hint that it was all part of his wakeful dream. The writer and director completely failed with the points they tried to make regarding mistrust of the health care system and they failed to create any tension after the main character wakes up from common medical procedure to find a major malpractice issue.  Perhaps an hour interview with a real nurse could have helped the writer?  A little internet research??  Instead we get this movie- predictable and boring.  YAWN.

Instead of sitting on the edge of our seats in horror and anticipation, my husband and I laughed as we fast forwarded.  The Amazon reviewer I mentioned compares his movie to Jacob's Ladder and other classics, but I say don't try to copy Jacob's Ladder if you don't have the skill or guts to really do something different and surprise the audience.  So what if you only had 1.5 million budget b/c it was an ""experiment""?  Whatever!!  That is not the audience's problem unless they were unfortunate and bought or rented this movie.

There is hardly any comparison between the two except for a thin similarity of the out of body experience. Of course one also has to realize that unlike ""Awake"", a complete Hollywood production, ""Sublime"" isn't. It is one of those side projects of Warner Brothers where the movie directly ends up on the DVD.

The movie is slow and poorly colored. Most of the brownish tone gets all the more depressing making it look as though it was made in the 70's. Probably that was the idea but it doesn't really make an impression. The small four or five worded quick inaudible conversations from the protagonist, early on in the movie was irritating after a point. The nudity is acceptable but the obscene language went a bit too far and even unecessary for a horror movie. The psycological analysis of the main character and trying to show the white man's fear of the black man swearing profusely and doing all the killing and mutilation also felt racist. They even mention that in the movie.

I can't go into too much detail without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say that that action and psychology of the film spring from the mind of a middle aged white-bread male who is bedridden in a very strange ward in a hospital. There's little splatter or blood here (save for a surgical incision), and we the audience follow him as he goes from reminiscences - mostly family and friends - to the strange east ward of the facility.

Despite the rather limited location, the movie kept my attention from beginning to end. Clocking in at 113 minutes, things were just about right, and the creators freed themselves from the token 90-minute horror standard. The movie tackles issues of innermost fears, and while I think the race issue was overplayed, there is some interesting political satire thrown into the mix, which is explained in detail during the director\writer commentary. The soundtrack is noteworthy, particularly the use of ethnic\techno hybrid sounds in the percussion. Used unobtrusively, it enhances the visual experience.

This might possibly be the greatest horror movie I've ever seen.
If not, it's definitely up there.
The line on the cover of the box states ""reminiscent of a really great ""Twilight Zone"" episode.
I thought........
I grew up on ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.
I was a ""Twilight Zone"" junkie.
I had ""Twilight Zone"" with my cereal in the morning.
If I could, I would inject ""Twilight Zone"" straight into my brain.
Heck one New Years Eve (or was it 4th of July??)I stayed up for three days straight just to tape all the ""Twilight Zone"" episodes without the commercials.
(So there's my credentials.)
And I positively loved this movie. Thought it was brilliant.
Up my alley?!?!
This movie was living in my apartment building!!!

What makes this movie frightening.....
No, what makes this movie scary as (....) is that it deals with a modern problem, a fairly common problem.
A problem that is very possible.
And they based this problem around something that every man eventually has to do.

Blown away doesn't begin to describe what this movie did to me.
This flick blasted me off my futon, out the window, and onto my neighbors lawn.
I felt like I got kicked in the chest by a bionic-kangaroo.
If you're looking for psychological horror, look no further.
This movie does for hospitals, what ""Psycho"" did for motels.
Really scary stuff here, 'cause it happens every day.
I don't want to give anything away, and if you read the reviews, some of them might ruin the impact this flick will have.
If you're a serious horror fan, and definitely if you're a ""Twilight Zone"" fan;
I absolutely DARE you to watch this, you will so NOT be disappointed.
I'm a gorehound, (my reviews reflect that)and even I loved this movie, despite it's lack of gore, and I'm willing to bet you will too.

Alot of folks will say ""it's the same old hat"" or ""it's too slow"".
But those people are either jaded, or smoking the hard ones.
Personally, I believe they were mis-led by the cover art,
which makes the movie appear as if it's a slasher flick,
which it absolutely isn't.

This is what horror is all about.
A straight to DVD movie, that flew under alot of radars,
which is better than anything the theateres have to offer.
This movie demands a viewing.
It may change your life.
It definitely changed mine.

Bravo!!

2730371,1,B000MGBLFU,"First of all, its quite pathetic that the screenwriters for this movie had to come up here (check the other reviews on this Amazon page) to defend this obviously despicable film, as if universal recognition that the movie is trash was not enough. I am a fan of all things `experimental', but they cannot dare call this experimental horror. I mean, any way you cut it, this film is very, very weak. It doesn't take a film scholar to figure that out.

The casting is very `cheap', to say the least. Cavanagh is not an actor, and his presence only lowers this film to one of those D-Grade late night films that no one caught the first time out. My peeve with the film is not that its so bad that I want to trash it - rather, its to ask the film-makers WHY they thought something so pedestrian and wasteful was worth making. In this case, to say that this movie was a `waste of my time' would be an understatement. The film has no reason to exist, and I would highly advise them to get rid of all the negatives while they still have time.

Oh and lets see - the `climax' of the movie had me gagging and almost barfing. Seriously dudes? Did you think you could pull that `It was all a Dream!!"" schtick so many years out of kindergarten? Jeez. In fact, the alternate reality that was presented where the lead actor is strapped to a bed and has his fingers and toes brutally cut off, seemed a much more pleasant and likeable conclusion than what was actually offered.

Simply put, the story sucks, the acting sucks, the direction is beyond abysmal, and the dialogue writers should realize that they're never going to get a decent picture to work on, so its better to quit while you're ahead and join Walmart while you can.

I was impressed to see Tom Cavanagh actually kind of act - I think he tends to fall back on his aw-shucks good looks way too often. Mandingo's character was one who could have used a lot more subtlety, but seeing as how he really blossoms during the apex of the film, it does make sense that he's a bit overdone at that point.

It really wasn't a bad film. I certainly didn't find it to be as bad as a lot of other reviewers seemed to. I just like my symbolism to be under a few more layers - I like to sit back a week or so after watching and have realizations hit me like  atruck.

2730387,3,B000MGBLFU,"Sublime (Tony Krantz, 2007)

Young, and very hot, producer Tony Krantz (24) sits in the director's chair for the first time for Sublime, an oddly-named psychological horror flick that starts out as a medical-incredible gone horribly wrong and attempts to grow into an extended meditation on rage, medical malpractice, white guilt, infidelity, and a whole host of other interesting topics. While it never quite succeeds, it's an incredibly ambitious piece of work, and bodes well for both Krantz and screenwriter Erik Jendresen (Deadlocked) going very far, once they've got a bit more experience under their belts.

George Grieves (Thomas Cavanagh, recently of How to Eat Fried Worms) goes in for a routine colonoscopy on his fortieth birthday, plagued by memories of a birthday party that was always on the verge of going bad the night before. When he wakes up, he discovers that, through a clerical error, a patient with a similar name got his procedure, and he was given an operation that has had some unforeseen complications. George, with the help of his guilty-feeling nurse Zoe (The Passage of Mrs. Calabash's Katherine Cunningham-Eves), tries to figure out why, all the sudden, everything seems to have gotten really, really weird since he woke up--is he going crazy as one of the side effects of the surgery, or is there really something more sinister behind what happened to him? All this is made worse by the presence of Mandingo (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, probably the best thing about the short-lived TV adaptation of Alien Nation), a male nurse who seems to head George and Zoe off at the pass whenever they get too close to an answer.

Technically, the film does what it's supposed to do, and does it passably well. The camerawork and lighting are exceptionally well-done for a film that came in under two million bucks, providing an atmosphere that's suitably claustrophobic. The acting is never less than competent, but veers, sometimes in the same character, from the ridiculous, to, well, you know. What's missing is the script, or part of it; Jendresen tried to cram a whole lot of ideas into a movie of less than two hours; everything referenced here could have easily expanded to fill four. The end result is we get a little of everything, but not much in depth of anything. The most depressing thing, however, is (judging by the comments) the number of people who didn't catch the reason behind Mandingo's name (and thus didn't catch the odd look George gets when he reports it, or misinterpreted it); watcgh the film of the same name before seeing this if you don't get the joke, and much will be made clear. I can't unhesitatingly recommend this deeply flawed movie, but if you can enjoy a film based on the potential it has, you'll find a rich vein of it here. ** ",1184716800,3,2787,4.861052631578947

As for the rest of the film, this expirement is a failure.  If you are going to play with the typical horror film and try to come up with something better, you need a few original ideas.  Mid-life concerns escalated to paranoia, sinister plots that are met with iron-clad disbelief despite the most sincere attempt at disclosure, the threat of mind-boggling torture...and ultimately the question of where the real terror lies, in the world around us or inside our heads -- these have all been worked over by better craftspeople than those involved with this film.

I am so tired of Hollywood's self-congratulatory insiders attempting to push junk like this down our throats and then tell us we are not wise enough to understand it when we dislike it.

2730392,4,B000MGBLFU,"Sublime is a red hot tamale hidden within the predominantly bland cheese pizza of the horror industry.  Some like it, some hate it, but no one forgets the unexpected taste of it.  I do not like the box cover, though - to me, at least, the image conveys the notion of cutting and scarring, and that made me expect this film to be some kind of slasher film - psychological, of course, but still a slasher.  Well, it's not a slasher; I would classify it as horror, though - definitely; it's just a deeply psychological, symbolic type of horror that actually plays quite effectively.  I should note that there are a few scenes of a medically gruesome nature, which may have squeamish folks squirming, but this story is not about blood and gore at all.  I haven't seen the commentary on the DVD, which is probably both fortunate as well as unfortunate.  While I would be very interested in hearing the director and writer explain their insights into the story, the rabble I hear about one of them saying the unfortunate main character of this film somehow represents George W. Bush leaves me happy to enjoy the film as it was, free of any directorial politics.  I see no connection whatsoever to my President in this film, and I'm happy to keep it that way (putting such a political spin on the film I saw seems utterly inane from my perspective).  This is a rare case when I believe the commentary can actually harm your enjoyment and impressions of a film.

It would be a crying shame for any reviewer to divulge any spoilers about this film, so I'm rather limited in what I can talk about.  At its most basic level, Sublime is the story of a man who goes in to the hospital for a routine colonoscopy, but - to his great misfortune - that routine procedure ends up being the polar opposite of routine.  Mistakes do happen, you know, resulting in as many as 100,000 deaths a year from what I have read (remember the case of doctors at Duke essentially killing a young girl by performing a heart and lung transplant with organs of the wrong blood type?).  George Grieves (Thomas Cavanagh) knows something is wrong as soon as he wakes up.  He's sweating like a hog, has an extraordinarily suspicious scar on his lower left abdomen (that would really be taking the long way to the colon), and he's sort of shoved off on the wrong floor across from the mysterious closed wing of the hospital.  There's no sign of his family or his doctor - just his nurse Zoe (Katherine Cunningham-Eves) and an exceedingly suspicious male nurse or orderly who makes George increasingly uneasy every time he comes by to change the IV bag.  Zoe happens to be everything I would want in a nurse, but even her uber-fine-ness can't make a dent in the anxiety and fear George is suddenly feeling.  Little does he know that the worst - and plenty of it - is still to come.  Basically, all of his deepest fears begin to realize themselves before his eyes, with virtually every new shock playing out against flashbacks of his fortieth birthday party the night before his ""test.""  Meanwhile, one medical mistake builds upon another, leaving George essentially trapped in a terrifying situation he can't understand.  Surreality doesn't even begin to describe the ordeal he has to endure.

Like it or not, the success of a movie such as Sublime hinges almost completely on the conclusion.  How many great films have we seen utterly destroyed by a terrible ending?  Thankfully, Sublime really delivers at crunch time; while some viewers may successfully predict how it all plays out, the film definitely takes the road less traveled rather than selling out in the final moments.  That's really important to me.

Different aspects of this story can and probably will be debated by those who see the film.  Personally, I think the filmmakers cast the net of George's fears a little too wide, as I see no reason why race was thrown into the mix.  I saw no real context for it, leaving me to interpret it as the product of an agenda on the part of the writer and director - and, for me, that took a little something away from the film.  Still, whatever excesses the film might have, they are borne of a remarkable boldness in both storyline and presentation, and that is what makes Sublime such an unforgettable film.",1180396800,10,4275,4.5981554677206855

There's no thrill or chills here and certainly no brain food to chew over. The fact that the film looks like it was shot on a Sony Handycam only adds insult to injury.

On the back of this DVD box is a quote ""Reminiscent of a really great Twilight Zone"". Now I love The Twilight Zone and there were many great ones...this doesn't even come close, nor should it be counted in the same ballpark, it is an insult to Rod Serling. I politely suggest that Pete Hammond of Maxim go back and watch some Twilight Zones...

This movie starts on in a somewhat mundane fashion...the main character wakes up just before hitting the ground in a falling dream. It is his 40th birthday and we are told by his loving wife that the procedure the next day is routine and he shouldn't worry. They allude to this dreaded procedure several times before we learn it is a colonoscopy.

He has the procedure, but when he wakes up we are lost trying to figure out what has happened and is happening to poor George Grieves...This movie is not for those with a weak stomach (I finally left the room and told my husband I had had enough). I did come back for the end. While I am now terrified of having a routine procedure done in the hospital (in spite of 5 surgeries in the last 13 years that went well), this movie is best forgotten in my humble opinion.

2730402,4,B000MGBLFU,"""Sublime"" is one of those movies that I really enjoyed watching at the time, but which lowered a bit in my estimation the more I thought about it later.  The attention to detail, the sumptuous imagery, and the incredibly precise directing make for compelling brain candy, but when you walk away from the experience, you realize your mind is still hungry.  This isn't a cinematic meal, in spite of the heavy helping of allegory, symbolism, philosophy and cultural references; it is a dark, well-spun mass of filmic cotton candy.

Thomas Cavanagh plays George Grieves, who has just turned 40 and is being checked into Mt. Abaddon Hospital for a routine colonoscopy.  The routine goes wrong (as it is won't to do) when charts are mixed up and doctors make mistakes.  Before you know it, George is struggling against unhelpful (and sometimes TOO helpful) nurses, cold hospital lawyers, an oddly distant family, and formlessly sinister forces that prowl the halls of the East Wing -- currently under construction.

What's going on?  Well, the tag line for the film is, ""Maybe if you spend your life worrying then the only way that your life will have meaning is if what you fear becomes real.""  George comes face-to-face with the tangled conjunction of virtually every one of his fears.  In one sense it is a mesmeric mosaic of metaphors, smartly-done, patient, probative.  In another sense it is a sloppy mess, a tossed salad of terror, drowned in the dark dressing of doom.

Overwritten comparisons aside, the film is, in fact, very well-done.  Every single cast member gives an impressive performance (kudos to Cavanagh, et. al.), every single scene is set-up with archeological diligence (hats off to directorial newbie, Tony Krantz), and the dialogue is perfect -- almost stunning (standing O for screenwriter Erik Jendresen).

What keeps this movie from being a great flick is it's lack of focus.  It tries so hard to be about so many things that it ends up being about very little at all.  In the last fifteen minutes, however, the story tries to rally every one of its disparate symbols and signs around one heady, political (some would say philosophical) point.  (Not to mention it makes use of a twist ending that has become so over-used in films these days that it couldn't really be called a ""twist"" anymore.)  In spite of this, it is mostly a success, but it is also repetitive and dragged-out.

It's also stunningly neat-n-tidy, providing contrast to the rest of the script's every-which-way-but-loose modality.  Although I can't say it resonated with me, I can say that it was a pleasing last bite for a movie that -- while it didn't sate my hunger -- at least gave me something tasty to chew on for awhile.",1175644800,7,2717,4.841991341991342
2730403,4,B000MGBLFU,"For what it's worth, I enjoyed Sublime.  Was it a tad too long....absolutely, but that is a forgivable point.  I believe that this film is getting bad reviews primarily because it was marketed to the wrong crowd.  I think that had this film been presented as a psychological thriller with some supernatural overtones, I think it would have been received much better.

The acting is quite impressive, and so is the writing and cinematography.  Kudos to all of the individuals who were involved in the making of this film as I find that they have all gone above and beyond their call of duty considering the time and budgetary challenges that this movie presented.

I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys stories which challenge you and make you think and talk about what you just saw.  If movies like Memento, Insomnia, Jacob's Ladder and anything that Lynch or Cronenberg have made adornes your DVD collection, then Sublime will make a good addition!",1175299200,22,954,4.815950920245399
2730404,2,B000MGBLFU,"[This review contains NO spoilers.]

Sublime is a movie about a man that goes in for a colonoscopy and wakes up having found out that there was a mix-up and the wrong procedure was performed. It follows his struggles after this to just get out of the hospital with strange things going on around him with his care and the rest of the hospital. That's the plot in a nutshell.

A movie like this where the main character is confused about what is going on (and the audience views the film through that character's eyes - without any outside narration or the POV of other characters) hinges on how the situation unfolds and what the eventual outcome is. For instance, a mystery novel needs to have a satisfying trail of clues and a satisfying payoff where the mystery is solved at the end. In this respect, I think this movie fails. The trail of clues was poor in that I was pretty sure exactly what the situation was pretty early on in the movie. (I won't say anymore than that because I do not want to spoil it for anyone.) The solution at the end of the film was also uninspired. The entire buildup of the film leads to no real payoff.

Another aspect of this movie that I did not like was the heavy-handed treatment given to ""the message"" in it. The filmmakers want to make a point regarding fear in our society and how white males cower in fear all the time. It's a point I'm not particularly impressed with for depth of thought and I was not impressed with the execution of it given how thick it was laid on the audience. I tired of it quickly.

I did find the makeup showing the maladies affecting the main character to be quite effective. That was well done. I also thought that the atmosphere in the film was well done. The hospital has an appropriate creepy feeling for what is going on. And the acting was also quite good too. I've long been a fan of Tom Cavanagh and it was interesting to see him in a role that is not traditional for him. Very nice surprise and excellent work on his part.

With those positives being said, they do not make up for the poor story and overkill with the message of the film (to the point where I felt belittled by it) and so I am only giving Sublime 2 stars.

sincerely,

2730406,1,B000MGBLFU,"OK......... right off the bat, we normally LOVE psychological thrillers that make you think as opposed to mindless ""6 kids in the woods getting slashed"" type garbage.

However SUBLIME fails on many levels....

1) You know what the story is going to be 15 minutes into the film, so there is no element of surprise as the end develops.

2) SPOILER ALERT.........................

The ""dream""/""hallucination"" (trying to not spoil too bad) scenes lose all creepiness because they are simply silly and stupid as opposed to frightening.

3) All the characters are so odd, you really never care for George, his wife, his kids or anybody for that matter.

All in all it came across as a movie trying to be very ""artsy-fartsy"" and trying to create mystery by editing together random and erratic hallucinatory sequences simply for the sake of being confusing as opposed to being intriguing storytelling.

We were suckered in by the fact that one of the Producers of the TV show ""24"" was involved in this project.

2730407,2,B000MGBLFU,"I love the kind of film this one was supposed to be, an intellectual thriller / drama (not horror).  it contains symbolism and imagery and political statements about the atmosphere of fear that currently permeates the united states of america.

the idea of this kind of movie is fine, the concept is sound and intriguing.  the actors were fine, i have no problem with TV talent doing movies.  original music is fine, and maybe it wasn't the best but i respect it completely for being original.

*** SPOILERS ***

the problem with this movie is that there is not enough ""stuff"" to justify its length.  this movie would have been brilliant as a short film, but the filmmakers insist on pummeling the viewer with these constant flashbacks that are seemingly meant to explain the already obvious symbolism, as if the viewer could not possibly ""get it"" otherwise.  every time the movie provides any small amount of visceral imagery, it kills said imagery with yet another flashback to that same, never ending 40th birthday party.  the use of symbolism in a film like this must be subtle and clever to be effective, not obvious and preachy.  and above all, the film as a whole must be ENTERTAINING, otherwise why am i watching it?  you can get all the messages in this film for free (with basic cable) and uncensored on a channel called CSPAN (and it would be more enjoyable to watch, after all it is REAL).

this film may accurately convey the experience of being trapped in a torturous nightmare of a coma, as was the intent, but the simple fact is, NO ONE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE A TORTUROUS NIGHTMARE OF A COMA.

this film MIGHT make you feel better about yourself, and your life (no matter how crappy it may be) but you don't get a chance to savor such feelings because all you feel when it's over is anger and resentment toward this film for being so LONG and for robbing you of precious life.

TO THE FILMMAKERS:

no need to explain, WE GET IT.  it was a good attempt, lots of people don't like it, accept it and move on.  mistakes are necessary in the learning process and i'm sure you will learn alot from this exercise.

to all concerned: in the writing of this review, no precious life was wasted, only the money of taxpayers  :-)

2730408,5,B000MGBLFU,"Due to the the intensity of the reaction to this film by fans of the horror genre (who are so disturbed as to spoil the story in their reviews) I thought I'd throw this in, for what it's worth:

SUBLIME was an experiment on nearly every level. Raw Feed is a Warner Bros. experiment to make ""horror"" films within the BROADEST definition of the genre. Films designed to be released directly to DVD.

John Shiban, Tony Krantz and Daniel Myrick would each make a film in 15 days for a budget of roughly 1.5 million dollars. Any one of them essentially could do whatever they wanted to do - to play into the genre, to satirize it, to bend it. Mr. Krantz's notion was to take the present atmosphere of fear and doubt that has pervaded our world; the very real statistics about ""health care""; and the horror of the Terry Schiavo case, and make a movie.

My involvement in the film came out of my close friendship with Tony.  Inspired by an Ambrose Bierce short story ""An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge""...the mystery of coma consciousness...the idea that when you close your eyes, your visual experience is limited to what you can remember...we crafted the script.

*******SPOILERS*******

Trying to capture our version of a fear-and-incident-inspired ""coma consciousness"" led to the film's intentionally languorous and lurid pace. It was a specific choice. Right or wrong, we were determined to stay true to George's vision: George is stuck in a 10-month-plus Persistent Vegetative State within which all of the things that he worries about manifest.  His only respite is when he closes his eyes and remembers his ""last supper"";  and many of his coma-realities are inspired by incidental details experienced that night:

Is Jenny actually unhappy in spite of what he wants to believe by ""looking into her eyes""? Is she going to leave him? Will his colonoscopy go wrong? Is his daughter experimenting with her sexual identity? Why is his son so fascinated by fear and evil? Is his partner going to stab him in the back? And what about the Unknown - the utterly unaddressed racism, abuse of minorities, and fundamentalist Islamic-terror that we've all been taught to fear? George is a version of a successful Everyman who worries about a lot without choosing to examine much.

He thinks it's enough to look in someone's eyes to know their truth. Well, clearly, it isn't.

And what happens when you lose complete control of your destiny and are stuck in a world of fear made manifest? Well, if your guardian angel happens to be a demon incarnation of ""the dark unknown"" who will guide you through a confrontation with your fears...that journey might just free you to make a tough decision and take control of your detiny again. And that's what George does, tragically, at the end.

As for the symbology of the film, it was governed by the myth-base of a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant - it's entirely Judeo-Christian. And we piled it on with a shovel. It's on the nose because it's familiar, learned pretty much during adolescence, and it's all that George knows.

It was extremely satisfying to indulge in the lurid Grand Guignol tradition of this film. Commercially, it was risky, because we were straying from the current tradition of the horror genre.

Shooting the film in 2:35, framing and pacing the story the way we did was utterly intentional.

Could it stand to lose 10-15 minutes for the sake of modern day attention spans? Sure.

Is its subject matter, approach and execution inappropriate for the ""horror genre""? Possibly.

Sublime is more in the tradition of psychological thriller/horror. The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Angel Heart, Jacob's Ladder, Memento, Eyes Wide Shut.

Sublime is not a pleasant movie.

If it's an experiment that failed for some and succeeded for others, I'm glad. I'd much rather that the film inspired strong opinions - even dismissive ones - than just lie there like another derivative grade B grindhouse gore-fest.

Without giving away any plot details, I'll just say that the more surreal imagery in this film is a bit wonky at times.

There was also some very shaky steady cam work in at least one scene that bothered me.

Apart from these minor grievances, I found this film interesting and topical. It's difficult to know exactly what to say about it, since it poses a moral dilemma, and then, if only for the purposes of the film itself, seems to take a stand.

It's a difficult film to categorize, because it is a blending of genres. There are some scenes in this movie that would only really appeal to horror fans. This film has more in common with a surrealist foreign film than an American horror movie.

The poster art that was chosen for this film might be the reason for the veritable cult of hatred that it inspired. The poster/box art is a lie. The character with the back tattoo is not intentionally malevolent, and never appears with the pruning scissors shown. If people feel as though they were fooled into buying or renting this movie, there is justification for that.

The movie itself is fine. The Tom Cavanagh character was difficult to like at first, but grew on me as the film progressed. The supporting cast did not have very much to do, but what they did do, they did well. I realized after viewing the film that what bothered me about the characters and the setting was that everything seemed too normal. In retrospect, the dilemmas that these characters face are probably not so different than the ordinary problems of any functional suburban family, and that although they were seemingly just written into the film for the Cavanagh character to react to, their problems and the way that the actors perform them do make these characters memorable.

I think this is a four-star film. Good but not great.

The easiest film to compare this one to is Jacob's Ladder, although this is a lesser film.

I would almost like to see it remade, with a larger budget.

It is worth seeing, if only once.

And the cover/poster art should be changed, since it is marketing this film to the wrong audience.",1424304000,,2186,4.551020408163265
