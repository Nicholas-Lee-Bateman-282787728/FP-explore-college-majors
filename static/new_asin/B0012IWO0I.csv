3089753,4,B0012IWO0I,"The legend is only one water horse lives per generation.  When the old one is ready to die, they lay an egg from which the new water horse is hatched and must grow up on its own as an orphan.

In this case, a young boy named Angus McMurrow found the egg and helped the waterhorse hatch and grow.  That's not a mean feat, considering this is World War II and a cadre of British soldiers are staying in the manor house where Angus' family lives. But if any kid is in need of a friend, it's Angus.  You see, his father went off to war--and Angus still believes he's going to come back despite being told to the contrary.  Angus finds a surprising ally in Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin), a returning soldier who still believes in the old myths and is in need of a dream as much as Angus is.

Of course, the complication is the British soldiers led by a toff commander who's noble father probably stuck him in Scotland to keep him out of the action.  They think that the Germans are going to come down Loch Ness and they've got the guns and ammo to take care of the problem if they do.  Not a healthy environment for a baby water horse to grow up in...

""Water Horse"" is beautifully filmed.  It captures the rugged beauty of Scotland amazingly.  The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard (of Toto fame and too many soundtracks to name) is gorgeous.  The music is perfect--as always.

Warnings:

Kids younger than five had problems with some of the scenes and a couple had to escort their frightened parents out into the lobby",1200873600,56,1514,4.341637010676156
3089754,5,B0012IWO0I,"I'm surprised to see so many reviewers state that this is good only as a kids' movie. I thought it was great myself, and both I (at 34) and my daughter (just turned 6) loved this movie. It had both humor and serious themes, and both realism and fantasy; history and lore. I can't imagine how it could have been better myself. I like that it wasn't dumbed down for kids. We get enough of that and we're tired of it. We don't want to sit through that rubbish ourselves and we don't like our kids to be talked down to. This movie doesn't condescend. It basically shows a child in an adult's world, dealing with responsibility and loss... but strangely it is a feel-good movie. Highly recommended!

(To parents: you must know your child - it has some tense moments and atypical of the American kids' movies, people still smoke and say ""arse"", but not a lot. Also there is artillery fire by the English army who plays a somewhat negative role in parts, but is basically redeemed as their leader begins to believe.)",1199750400,3,1009,4.454054054054054
3089755,4,B0012IWO0I,"Imagine you're a young Scottish boy who's father is off fighting in World War II. Nothing's been the same since he left. You're lonely and you miss him terribly, but you find some comfort in combing the beaches for treasures left by the waves. One day in a tidal pool you find a large barnacle encrusted rock. Or maybe it's a strange shell. You take it home and discover your life is changed forever.

Thus begins young Angus MacMorrow's story. His rock turns out to be an egg, and the animal that hatches from it (he names him Crusoe after Robinson Crusoe) just might be the rarest of all creatures: a water horse. Legend has it there can only be one of them alive in the world at one time, and now Angus is faced with the challenge of keeping a secret who is growing by leaps and bounds. How can he possibly hide something this big?

Dick King-Smith has written several popular children's books, and this marks another of his novels made into a charming family movie (he also wrote Babe). It's been said that a lot of creative license was taken in this book to movie adaptation, so I approached The Water Horse strictly as a filmgoer.

The Water Horse could conjure up comparisons to Eragon for the egg-hatching-into-a-creature moments (Crusoe does look a lot like Saphira the dragon as a baby). But unlike Eragon, this movie is set in reality. Taking place in Scotland but filmed largely in New Zealand, the only thing of fantasy here is Crusoe. And that's quite enough.

Newcomer Alex Etel is perfect in the role of Angus. The supporting cast of Emily Watson as Angus' mother, Anne, and Ben Chaplin as a mysterious handyman who may or may not be a spy brought a depth to the film that adults will appreciate. You feel the concern Anne has for her children growing up in a troubled time of war, especially for withdrawn Angus who counts the days until his father comes home. To make matters worse, the Allied forces sets up camp on their property, making it impossible for this mother to shelter her children from it.

It isn't hard to believe a creature like Crusoe could actually exist, except for in one scene involving Angus riding on Crusoe's back. How the boy manages to hold onto the animal's slippery neck as they DIVE into the water and swim the depths of the Loch (not to mention how Angus held his breath for that long) is harder to believe. Children will eat it up.

Ultimately, like the good-old Disney movies of our childhoods, The Water Horse delivers on all levels. Sure, the plot was as predictable as the creature was cute. There's the typical black tie dinner ruined by creature mayhem, and a lot of angst over the water horse's safety, but that's exactly the way we want a movie like this. The Water Horse is a delightful romp through a child's dream come true, sure to please the whole family.

3089756,5,B0012IWO0I,"Such superb visual effects that the water horse could almost be real.  Depicted how it would have been during wartime, I found this movie entertaining and great viewing.  Adults and children ages 5 and over would like this movie.....excellent!!!!!!!!  Can't wait for it to be sold as a dvd.",1199404800,3,290,4.877551020408164
3089757,3,B0012IWO0I,"This is a kid movie. It is definitely aimed at the 8-14 set, and my son aged 10 adored it. It definitely captured his budding cryptid interest, and has set him in search of the book the movie's based on and all other things Nessie.

This did not need to be a kid movie.

This could have been the movie that straddled the gap between Narnia and Pan's Labyrinth. It would have been a delight, with a strong central plot and lots of character development among the secondary characters. The visuals are good, the water horse well realized. The background - well, it's Scotland. Craggy and beautiful.

Except some film idiot got a hold of it.

The movie, if just a shade darker, could have the same inspirational notes and themes. The same imagery, the same tonal moods in both score and visuals.

There is a place near my home that makes wonderful homemade old-style pies. She does not use the filling that is in a jar; there is no syrup in her apple pies. There is one drawback to her pies: After you've eaten one, you can tell when a can of goopy fructose is used to substitute for inferior ingredients or skill.

This movie could have been great, but I could not help but be annoyed at the heavy saccharine glaze. It was a little too obvious - the music swells noticeably when it's inspirational, the lightning flashes on the antagonist's face a little too cartoonishly. It is like taking a delighful pie and dumping fructose on it, like taking a natural beauty and covering thier face in cake makeup, like a finely crafted tiramisu and covering it in hot fudge.

Don't get me wrong - the goodness in all of those things does show through. It's a movie well worth taking your kids to, both to spur thier interest in things unusual and to have a fun time. It's just a shame that this movie wasn't made to its full potential - still accessible for kids, but not leaving adults with a saccharine aftertaste.",1199232000,4,1904,4.469740634005763
3089758,4,B0012IWO0I,"Crossing a tale between an explanation of the fabled Loch Ness Monster with the backdrop of World War II,  `Deep Water Horse' comes across as `Pan's Labyrinth' for children.  Full of whimsy and brimming with innocence, the movie is a harbor for the imagination.

Taking place in Scotland where the legend of Loch Ness has allegedly been spotted, an elderly man engages a couple at the local pub where he relates a fabled adventure of the past.  Transporting us in the narrative to 1942, Angus MacMorrow examines some ""magical shells"" around Loch Ness to collect and take home. His father has been absent from The War for about a year now.  Angus (perfectly cast as Alex Etel of `Millions' fame) spots one and takes it home to his father's workshop where he tries to pry through its exterior to find dazzling layers beneath.  Being called away, it is a short time later that noise in the shop alerts him of some new development.  Angus to his astonishment sees a creature waddling on the floor of his father's shop.  Looking much like a cross between a seal and a platypus, the awkward young thing soon takes a liking to Angus who feeds it and makes some space for him in a bucket of water.

The trouble is Crusoe, as he soon names him, grows very quickly.  Trying futilely to keep him from his sister, Anne (Emily Watson), his mother (Lorraine McDonald), and a newly hired hand, Lewis (Ben Chaplin), he, nevertheless, puts him in the bathtub.  Soon everyone except his mother is in on the secret, but once he grows too big, it is apparent he must let him go back to the water to accommodate his amphibious nature.

Enter the Scottish army.  While they laudably provided for the Allies, they do make life uncomfortable for Angus and will soon do so for Crusoe when they find his presence in Loch Ness. Captain Hamilton (David Morrissey) is a reassuring presence for his mother, who certainly could use a man around the house, but the changes are certainly unsettling for Angus, who needs Crusoe as a reassuring outlet and companion.  Crusoe is a nice escape for a boy who misses his father and must deal with a surrogate who knows little more than to say, ""The boy needs more discipline."" (In this way I saw the closest parallel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>.)

The scenes when Angus rides and befriends Crusoe are a highlight of the film, and the playful voyage is filled with nifty special effects.  Some of the chase scenes in the harbor and around the house keep a playful spirit to the adventure.  Like 'Stardust' and 'Enchanted' before it, 'Water Horse' is an entertaining and fun ride.  While some of the elements borrow a bit from the classic 'E.T.,' this film is original and transporting enough in its own right. (Based on the book by Dick King-Smith)",1199232000,26,2885,4.877049180327869
3089759,4,B0012IWO0I,"Water Horse is just a family movie, with no blood spilled, sexuality or profane language.  It's set in Scotland with minimal animation used in the film, which is pleasant and refreshing.  This movie is a great contrast to recent movies released incorporating massive animation and digital effects.  I liked the night as well as the day lighting scenes showing technical skills by the producers and crew.  The actors and actresses were very skilled in their movements and facial expressions, it's well acted and the actors-actresses are all speaking with Scottish accent (home grown or not?).
The settings are authentic looking and props well selected.
There's some borrowing from Free Willie (the movie) at the end, but for the most part is original, mythical and creative.  I recommend and I'm a  50 year old male just enjoying a break from the usual warrior and action adventure movies.  I'm buying DVD.",1198972800,2,905,5.033557046979865

3089761,3,B0012IWO0I,"When I saw the preview for ""Water Horse: Legend of the Deep,"" I was hoping it would be an entertaining, if kid-oriented movie. Well, at least it's kid-oriented.

An American tourist couple in a Scottish bar see the famous alleged photograph of the Loch Ness Monster. The man says that the photo is fake, and an elderly Scottish man says that there's more to the photograph than they think. So we flashback to the 1940s, and see the story of young Angus MacMorrow, who finds a large egg on the shores of Loch Ness. Out of the egg comes a mysterious dragon/dinosaur creature. Angus names him Crusoe. The animal turns out to have a pleasant disposition, and except for occasionally snapping at Angus and running through the house (and drawing the attention of the dog in the process), is generally very loveable. Crusoe, of course requires food and a wet environment, which Angus does his best to provide. Unfortunately, a division of the British Army, having reason to believe that the Nazis might try to invade Scotland via the shoreline where the MacMarrows' house is, come and station themselves there. So Angus must keep Crusoe a secret from the troops and everyone else. His sister does find out, however, as does the new handyman Lewis Mowbray. As Crusoe eats, however, he becomes too big to keep in the house, and Lewis and Angus decide they should put him in the lake. In the meantime, Angus's mother Anne finds her son's behavior erratic, and decided to put him under the supervision of the head of the garrison, Captain Hamilton. Angus cannot stop thinking of Crusoe, however, and goes off looking for him. Eventually Angus finds his ""pet"", who is now as big as a dinosaur. After Captain Hamilton fires  artillery into the lake, Crusoe is seriously frightened, and loses his friendly disposition next time Angus sees him. The rest of the movie basically consists of Angus trying to get Crusoe to have a happy time on  his own and getting him past the army's submarine net.

Kids (at least the younger ones) will probably enjoy ""Water Horse."" It has a nice (if predictable) story of a boy finding and befriending a loveable creature and trying to protect it. Unfortunately, there are far too many flaws for the movie to appeal across the age range. For instance, the movie takes way too long to get to the main plot development point of Crusoe being bombarded. Further, it's not really clear who the antagonist in the movie is supposed to be. There's a sinister-looking soldier that Angus sees a few times, but he really does not turn out to be a villain. Nor does Captain Hamilton. Some parts of ""Water Horse"" were not believable. For instance, the first time after Crusoe surfaces after being bombarded, he turns vicious, but then turns back to his old self, just like that. Finally, the scenes of Crusoe trying to get past the submarine net are way too cloying, not to mention them being a rip-off of Free Willy. This movie is good for kids, but to everyone else I would advise waiting until it's available to rent.",1198540800,3,3025,4.691148775894539

3089767,1,B0012IWO0I,"This was one of the most disappointing films for our family.  We had just listened to an Audible book version of The Waterhorse and my 9 yr old daughter and 4 yr old son really enjoyed the simple and well told story of a young boy living at the Scottish lock Ness, finding an egg that hatches into a mythical water horse, which he raises and eventually sets free in the lock.  .  My wife looked up the movie trailer and it looked fun, and more or less seemed to be consistent with the book.  It was not.  It is a perfect example of how hollywood can take far too many liberties with a story, turning it into a tense action adventure burdened with pathetic characters and cumbersome plot that did not exist in the book.  World War 2 soldiers marching around, cannons and machine guns firing at the water horse... pure dreck.  It seems that if a writer wants a better chance of having their screenplay being picked for movie production, even a children's story, it is a good strategy to inject content that is anti-German, Holocausty, violent, WW2 era propaganda.
The silver lining for our family was that this experience provided an opportunity to discuss what stories are, what happens to them as they are retold, how storytellers have agendas that they are pushing and how important it is to for us to be aware of this as we expose ourselves to media and to not passively swallow whatever is being shoveled at us.",1502496000,3,1414,4.5

3089795,5,B0012IWO0I,"The twin successes of The Fellowship of the Ring and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 2001 alerted studios that there was an audience for well-made fantasy films and a number of nicely budgeted films followed. Though fantasy films had been popular in the 80's they had almost disappeared for a while.. The Water Horse was one of the best of these and struck just the right tone between comedy and drama with the creature, named Crusoe by Angus, the boy who is the central character, morphing from adorably cute to almost frightening. Many child-and-creature films before had reduced the danger factor considerably until the films became silly comedies.

Budgeted at a healthy forty million, the film has fine actors, beautiful Scottish settings (and beautiful New Zealand settings standing in for Scottish settings), authentically detailed evocation of the World War II time period and great special effects from Weta Workshop, who did Lord of the Rings, that produced a lifelike creature that always seemed to actually be there. The film was supported by one of noted film score composer Jame Newton Howard's most exciting adventure scores which embraced the Celtic setting and included The Chieftain's along with the usual orchestra.

The result is a family film that all ages can enjoy, even parents and grandparents. The film accomplishes this by working as a character drama of a young boy missing his father who left for the war effort, his mother and sister who know he is dead but are fearful of telling the boy, the arrival of the British Army to protect the local Loch from German submarine intrusion, and possible spies and romantic tension between two men who have an eye for the widowed mother. That's a lot more backstory and context than many other fantasy films aimed at families, which tend to have stock characters and settings. Into all this, which could have made a movie itself with more writing is tossed a creature from Celtic legend, a water horse, a Loch Ness type of sea monster most often totally evil in the original legends, luring people, mostly children, to ride on it's back then drowning them. Here the creature is raised from his birth from an egg the boy Angus finds on the lake shore and so bonds with the boy in a rare friendship. As a hatchling Crusoe is cute, playful and apt to get into trouble-causing antics that provide comedy in the early part of the film. As a magical creature his growth rate is abnormally fast and soon can no longer be hidden in the house (the beautiful Ardkinglas House on the west coast of Scotland).

Alex Etel does a fine job playing Angus, a large role for a young boy to carry. Emily Watson is totally sympathetic as the mother and the supporting cast is believable in their roles. The film is both exciting and heartwarming and can be recommended easily to anyone inclined to like this sort of fantasy film.",1481932800,3,2887,4.781563126252505

3089878,1,B0012IWO0I,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

3089912,3,B0012IWO0I,"Watched this on Netflix, and was fairly disappointed. This is the familiar story of a young boy who finds a fantastical creature, raises it, and tries to protect it from exploitation and harm.

The acting is not terrible, but many of the characters are cartoonish, and none of the critical characters have adequate development. There's a bit of romantic hinting, but no resolution. The sister, the mother, and other central characters just aren't introduced well enough.

Then there's the plot. It's somewhat forgivable, being a children's movie, but there are lots of plot holes and things glossed over.

OK movie for the kids, but there are many better options.",1458345600,,663,5.064220183486238

Just about the only thing this movie has in common with the book is its name.  I see the newest version of the book has a cover advertising how it is now a movie and I wonder how the author allowed this movie to be associated with his book.  The book is sweet and endearing and a good, clean read.  It has nothing to do with war at all.  The father isn't gone or dead; he is a sailor and returns from time to time and helps the family out with Crusoe. The family doesn't live in a giant mansion owned by some lord. They live in their own little house with the children's grandfather nicknamed, Grumble. Nobody tries to capture Crusoe.  He does not have to escape to freedom. If you've seen the movie, you're probably asking by now, so what in world is the book about???  Exactly.  Nothing is the same.  So this review is just for those who actually read the book first... just pretend the movie is a brand new piece of work, unconnected to Dick King-Smith's book, and maybe you will be able to enjoy it.",1457568000,,1165,4.259090909090909

3089998,5,B0012IWO0I,"The Water Horse is a tremendous children's story that ignites the imagination and fantasy that children often feel based on the AMAZING presentation.  This film is sort of similar to the Neverending Story in a way, but perhaps better because the special effects of the mythical water horse creature are more believable in this movie.  It also takes place during World War II.

It's about a little Scottish boy (Alex Etel) who stumbles upon what appears to be a strange rock near the sea.  Upon taking it home he begins to peel it apart with a knife and sees that it glows a mysterious light blue.  He chooses to hide it in the shed so his mother (Emily Watson) doesn't discover it.  She doesn't approve of pets... especially unexplainably humongous pets!  Well shortly after a huge rainstorm hits and Alex awakens to the sound of chaos coming from the shed.  He runs outside, opens the door... and sees that a mess has been created.  Turns out that rock was actually an egg, and a baby adorable water horse is running loose (and he's SO adorable!)

For the first half of the film it's all about Alex, his sister and a handyman played by Ben Chaplin that all keep the water horse a secret.  However this little creature has the ability to grow big *very* quickly.  I mean overnight he grows three times bigger.  He grows big enough that it's impossible to keep him in the house, so they eventually take him to the sea where he finds himself under attack by cannonballs because there's a war going on (World War II) and the soldiers are testing their weapons much to Alex's STRONG dislike and concern. Dodging cannonballs turns the monster very angry and defensive, even turning on Alex at one point.  This is where David Morrissey comes into the picture- a strict soldier that demands Alex be disciplined because his wild imagination is causing nothing but trouble around the home front.

I personally thought the first half was better.  Alex being a playful child keeping a mythical creature hidden around the house from his mother was more interesting than the boy riding around on this sea monsters back avoiding danger in the second half.  The first half is when the family bulldog gets into mischief with the sea creature, leading to a hilarious chase scene.  This is when people assume the bulldog is nothing but trouble but aren't aware of the presence of a sea creature being responsible for the bulldogs behavior.  The writing here, and the way the characters interact while developing their characters, is really good.  The second half is good too, but to a lesser extent.

There was another soldier that Alex sees that I thought would become a bigger part of the story because he had an angry look and it seemed like he was there to intimidate poor Alex, but he only appears a few times.  He should have played a bigger role.  Turns out the handyman has his own backstory and reason for being there.  He's a vital part of the story helping Alex with the sea monster.  At first when I saw the military drive up to this Scottish village where the boy lives, I thought something more significant was going to take place involving a war scene of some kind (hey I wasn't initially sure what country these soldiers belonged to and for a moment thought they were German).  But it turns out they're only at this Scottish village to relax in the countryside for a while.

Overall, a really well-told story that the children will probably love.  The acting, writing, story, characters, presentation (especially the presentation)... everything is spot-on perfect.",1443744000,,3562,4.710823909531502

3090007,4,B0012IWO0I,"The Good: This film caught my attention because it was based on an ancient Celtic legend, and I am unabashedly fond of old Celtic legends.  I wasn't disappointed; it's a very entertaining and touching story with excellent performances by Alex Etel (Angus MacMorrow) and Ben Chaplin (Lewis Mowbray) in the lead roles.

The scenery is incredibly beautiful.  While the rugged mountains around Lake Wakatipu in New Zealand aren't exactly the rolling hills of the Scottish highlands, it is suggestive of Loch Ness enough to carry the story along wile provding a wonderful backdrop for the movie.  The camera successfully avoids the snowcapped peaks of the Remarkables Moutains, so it really does look a heck of a lot like the terrain around Loch Ness.

The portrayal of ""Crusoe"" the water horse was so believable and realistic that I didn't even think about special effects until the film was over.  Then I looked up the credits and was not surprised to see that Weta Workshop once again delivered the goods.

The Bad: The film ends with unresolved plot elements, especially the apparent romance between Lewis Mowbray and Anne MacMorrow and the disposition of the British army emplacement on the MacMorrow farmland.

We're ignoring the geography of Loch Ness here.  Its outlet is a river that passes through the city of Inverness before flowing into Moray Firth and the North Sea.  This makes the entire plot scheme where the British army has gun emplacements and nets against German submarines invading Loch Ness quite nonsensical.  Compounding this error, the portrayal of the British army as clownish buffoons is outright offensive and out of place in this story.

The Ugly: I have to condemn Sony Entertainment for packaging this family-friendly film with forced previews of sociopathic hate propaganda disguised as children's animated movies.  Get professional help; don't pass your severe mental illness on to another generation.",1438646400,2,1930,5.167202572347267

What is keeping this DVD on my shelf, rather than trading it in, is the delightful English Bulldog in the story.  (And no, I don't have a Bulldog, I have a Border Collie and a Labrador).  This Bulldog gives a great performance as a spunky dog who regularly chases the Water Horse, though never actually does any harm.  A charming dog in a charming movie.

3090245,5,B0012IWO0I,"I have to admit, going into 'The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep' I was apprehensive. Right on the DVD and Blu-Ray cover it makes the bold claim that it is ""The most wondrous film of its kind since E.T.""  I scoffed, having in 2007 seen the trailers and passed Water Horse off as a shameless E.T. rip-off.  It turns out you can't always judge a film by its trailer.  Having just finished watching The Water Horse I find myself finding it hard to disagree with the cover's claim: in the sub-genre of children befriending extraordinary creatures The Water Horse may very well be the best since Spielberg's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.

Directed by Jay Russel (My Dog Skip) and based on a novel Dick King-Smith (Babe: The Gallant Pig) The Water Horse takes place in Scotland during WWII and follows  young Angus MacMorrow (Alex Etel, `Millions') who discovers a mysterious egg on the shore of the Loch.  Soon the edge hatches a aquatic reptile which Angus names Crusoe.  Along with his sister and hired handyman Mowbray (Ben Chaplin) Angus must hide Crusoe from his mother (Emily Watson) and the Royal Artilery regiment that has taken residence around his home (watching the Loch in case German submarines attempt to penetrate).

Now, if you were like me seeing the trailers for The Water Horse in 2007 you thought: ""Another E.T. knock-off?  Pass.""  And yes, the creature story elements of The Water Horse are fairly convention (scenes of kids hiding the creature from their mother, creature run amuck, etc.), but what Water Horse has over most films to follow Spielberg's footsteps is heart, and real characters brought to life by a top-notch cast.  This isn't just another E.T. clone: it is a coming of age story set in WWII.  The story of Angus raising Crusoe ties in wonderfully with the story of his father having gone off to war and carries weight not typically found in these films.  I've heard some complaints from people who feel it's a fantasy film slapped onto a period drama, but I personally feel the fantasy of Water Horse is a seasoning that brings out the flavor of the human interactions.

Performances are a solid across the board.  Young Alex Etel really does turn in a remarkable performance being able to perfectly share the screen with Chaplin and Watson.  I especially love the interactions with the Mulbury character.  Mulbury becomes aware of Crusoe early on so that it isn't just children hiding the creature from adults for 110 minutes.  Having an adult character's perspective I feel really helps draw older viewers into the magic of the story.  By helping the children hide Crusoe he shows a level of respect adults in this kind of film seldom do (usually adults only exist to scream and endanger the creature).

Of course this Water Horse wouldn't be so legendary if it didn't have the special effects necessary to bring Crusoe to life.  The technical wizards at Weta (The Lord of the Rings, King Kong) make the most of the film's $40 million budget and, quite frankly, turn in better effects than many films I've seen with three times the resources.  While the computer generated Crusoe can appear dated in some respects -either do to budget constraints or technological advances since the film's release--the character is incredibly expressive and radiates warmth and -when the film calls for it-- menace.  This is a great computer generated character from the best in the business and because of it the film will age better than most other contemporary family pictures released during the 2000s.  Scenes of Crusoe carrying Angus above and below the surface of the Loch are simply breathtaking and are sure to fill you with a childish sense of wonder.

If you have children or simply want a well-acted fantasy film I can't recommend this film enough.  It isn't without its flaws, but it more than makes up for them with its radiant heart and top-notch acting performances.  In a sea of mindless children's films which profit on crude humor and slapstick Water Horse is a genuinely heartfelt motion picture which I wish we'd see more of.  Many people -myself included- missed out on this film at the cinema in 2007 but I promise you this is a film worth sharing.

There is a kind of magic in the cinema, especially when seen through the eyes of children.  The Water Horse has that magic, and I know beyond reason of doubt that when I have children and they're old enough to watch their first movie films like The Water Horse are going to be at the top of my list.  It has its flaws, and is far from being a perfect film, but the more I think of the favorite films as a child the more I realize that very few of them are ""perfect"" in a traditional sense.  The Water Horse is just as flawed and enjoyable as many family films in cinema's history and it seems you either love it or hate it for that reason.  I've made up my mind and am giving this film my highest recommendation.",1388793600,,4903,4.677156177156177

It's about a boy during a World War who is waiting for his dad to come home. He has an older sister who's busy with her own life and a mom who's totally immersed in her job which is housekeeper/manager for an English lord who is away in Europe.

My 7 year old found some of the high-drama scenes a little too scary, but there is nothing here that is too scary for the younger set IMHO.  I thought the music, the cinematography, and the acting were all superb, and the age-old story of a child loving and caring for a  creature just never gets old for me.  I would put this in the same category with ET, and The Secret of Roan Innish (better film, altogether... deserves five stars).",1383436800,4,699,4.265151515151516

This 8 year old is very resistant to not repeat watching any of his favorite cartoon movies and my technique is to say that we'll give a new DVD 15-20 minutes. It was late after an intensely active day, and he agreed to give Water Horse a try. Within 10 minutes, the egg becomes active and traps our attention.

Full of whimsy and brimming with innocence, the movie is a harbor for the imagination.

Taking place in Scotland where the legend of Loch Ness has allegedly been spotted, an elderly man engages a couple at the local pub where he relates a fabled adventure of the past. Transporting us in the narrative to 1942, Angus MacMorrow examines some ""magical shells"" around Loch Ness to collect and take home. His father has been absent from The War for about a year now. Angus (perfectly cast as Alex Etel of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millions/dp/B000AP04GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millions</a>' fame) spots one and takes it home to his father's workshop where he tries to pry through its exterior to find dazzling layers beneath. Being called away, it is a short time later that noise in the shop alerts him of some new development. Angus to his astonishment sees a creature waddling on the floor of his father's shop. Looking much like a cross between a seal and a platypus, the awkward young thing soon takes a liking to Angus who feeds it and makes some space for him in a bucket of water.

The trouble is Crusoe, as he soon names him, grows very quickly. Trying futilely to keep him from his sister, Anne (Emily Watson), his mother (Lorraine McDonald), and a newly hired hand, Lewis (Ben Chaplin), he, nevertheless, puts him in the bathtub. Soon everyone except his mother is in on the secret, but once he grows too big, it is apparent he must let him go back to the water to accommodate his amphibious nature.

Enter the Scottish army. While they laudably provided for the Allies, they do make life uncomfortable for Angus and will soon do so for Crusoe when they find his presence in Loch Ness. Captain Hamilton (David Morrissey) is a reassuring presence for his mother, who certainly could use a man around the house, but the changes are certainly unsettling for Angus, who needs Crusoe as a reassuring outlet and companion. Crusoe is a nice escape for a boy who misses his father and must deal with a surrogate who knows little more than to say, ""The boy needs more discipline."" (In this way I saw the closest parallel to Pan's Labyrinth.)

The scenes when Angus rides and befriends Crusoe are a highlight of the film, and the playful voyage is filled with nifty special effects. Some of the chase scenes in the harbor and around the house keep a playful spirit to the adventure. Like 'Stardust' and 'Enchanted' before it, 'Water Horse' is an entertaining and fun ride. While some of the elements borrow a bit from the classic 'E.T.,' this film is original and transporting enough in its own right.

Directed by Jay Russell, ""The Water Horse-Legend of the Deep"" is yet another in a long line of ""E.T.-The Extraterrestrial""-wannabes (heck, even the two movies' titles sound the same) - only in this case the adorable alien from outer space has been replaced by the only slightly less adorable and certainly far more unwieldy creature known in folklore as the Loch Ness Monster. It's almost as if little Elliot had wandered into ""Jurassic Park"" instead of the forest outside his home.

The Elliot of this tale is one Angus MacMorrow (Alex Etel), a lonely lad living with his mother (Emily Watson) and older sister in a lakeside village in 1942 Scotland. Angus' dad is currently off serving in the war and the young boy counts the days till his planned return. One day, while playing in a local tide pool, Angus uncovers a mysterious giant egg which he takes home with him, only to discover that out of it has hatched a strange and heretofore mythological creature known as a water-horse.

Angus goes through the requisite routine of making friends with the creature, trying to hide him from the others in the household, frantically trying to save him from the military-industrial-complex forces out to destroy him, becoming all teary-eyed and emotional at their inevitable separation - in short, just about everything Spielberg did so masterfully in ""E.T.,"" and that has been so dishonored in the imitation.

Luckily, the movie does improve a bit in the second half, when the script turns away from the ""E.T."" parallels and towards the wartime aspects of the tale. But even here the military characters are largely two-dimensional in nature, with only Angus' mom and a newly arrived handyman by the name of Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin) providing any real human drama. The script by Robert Nelson Jacobs, based on the book by Dick King-Smith, also employs the cheesiest story-framing device of them all - the now-grownup character spinning the yarn to a spellbound audience in the form of an extended flashback - to tell its tale.

The special effects are wildly uneven, with some of the CGI looking mighty convincing and some of it looking like badly processed rear-screen projection from thirty-some-odd years ago. Moreover, one scene, involving Angus' activities with the creature in the water, is so utterly implausible that even a movie as based as this one is on asking the audience to suspend its disbelief can't quite pull it off.

Even with an original theme song written and sung by Sinead O'Connor, this aquatic a-boy-and-his-dog story is all wet.",1312329600,2,2561,4.958041958041958

3090411,5,B0012IWO0I,"When I first saw the commercials and previews for this movie, I wrote it off as ""another of those kids' movies"" and had no interest in seeing it.

However, recently my fiancee and I stumbled upon it and (for some reason) decided to give it a chance - I was glad we did! This movie has got something for everyone in it, and everyone can watch it: there is no swearing or sex in it, just a story (told from the perspective of an older gentleman in a bar) about Angus (who I would say is between 5 and 6 years old) who is struggling with loneliness after his father left to go fight in World War II. Angus also is terribly frightened of water, but one day he happens to find a big, mysterious stone-like object (later revealed to be an egg) on the shores of Loch Ness. Angus hurries home with the egg and hides it from his family in his dad's workshop. Angus lingers behind in the workshop for several minutes, prying off a layer of crust, scaling and what appear to be barnacles, only to find out that the item is, in fact, an egg, and it's breaking open.

The hatchling emerges and begins to ransack the workshop, and Angus is worried that it will make too much noise and be discovered. Around this time, a handyman (later seen to be a former British Navy sailor) shows up to do some work around Angus's mom's estate. At first Angus doesn't like the new stranger - perhaps because he feels that the new man will try to take his dad's place, or feels that the handyman will discover (and dispose of) Angus's new friend (named ""Crusoe"" after a book Angus sees on his dad's shelf). These feelings are quickly resolved, however, as Angus's new friend begins to grow quickly.

Crusoe is discovered in the bathtub (as Angus had recently discovered that the rapidly-growing creature loves water) by the handyman, but to Angus's surprise he embraces the creature and tells Angus some of the legend associated with it (that there can only be one ""water horse"" in the world at a time).

By this point, a garrison of British soldiers was staying in the estate as well, since they believed that German subs could ambush Scotland via the ""loch"", and had devised a system for ensnaring - and destroying - the submarines if any did show up in the loch.

Lewis (the handyman) and Angus take the enormous (by my guess, the size of an average house) Crusoe to the loch and slip him into the water. A British soldier spots the creature's head and neck (about the same shape as a periscope) and alerts his commander, who thinks that the Germans are coming. Angus and Lewis fight to convince the British otherwise, but is it too late? You'll have to see this movie for yourself to find out!

Very, very highly recommended - there's something in this movie for everyone, even though, on the surface, it appears to be aimed at a younger audience.",1305504000,2,2822,4.448742746615087

3090422,5,B0012IWO0I,"In the spring of 1942, England has been at war for almost three years, and Charlie MacMorrow (Craig Hall) has been off in the Navy nearly as long, leaving his Anne (Emily Watson) to earn her living as housekeeper at the country estate of Lord Killain near Loch Ness and raise their two children, Kirstie (Priyanka Xi), 12, and Angus (Alex Etel), 8, as best she can.  Angus, painfully shy and at once fascinated and terrified by the water, is focused on nothing but the day his father will come home; it isn't till well into the story that we learn Charlie's ship was sunk nearly a year ago, though Angus isn't ready to admit, even to himself, that ""Dad"" is probably lost.  Then one day he discovers a strange object--a solid oval, encrusted with barnacles and other sea-wrack, under which it is a gorgeous iridescent blue--on the beach and brings it home.  It turns out to be an egg, and out of it hatches a small reptilian creature that Angus names Crusoe.  Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin), the new handyman, identifies it as a ""water horse,"" of which, like the phoenix, there's only ever one at a time, and since it grows with a prodigious speed, he ends up helping Angus to get it into the loch.  But Crusoe is Angus's only real friend, and the bond is mutual.  When a regiment of artillery is billeted on the estate and a submarine net is installed at the seaward mouth of the loch, Angus's secret--and Crusoe's safety--are put in mortal peril.

Besides the truly touching relationship between Angus and Crusoe--who, of course, turns out to be the Loch Ness Monster--the best part of this movie is naturally the beastie himself, modelled on a sea lion in his earliest stages and a prehistoric pleisiosaur later on.  The animation--right down to the expressions on his face--is absolutely incredible, and his graceful leaps and dives belie his size.  There's also a lot of delightful humor as baby Crusoe gets into all kinds of mischief about the estate.  The movie is based on Dick King-Smith's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Water-Horse/dp/0375842314/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Water Horse</a>&nbsp;but improves greatly on the original (though I couldn't help thinking that if I'd been making it, I'd have added a Nazi submarine to the mix!).

3090424,4,B0012IWO0I,"A fantasy-drama released in 2007, The Water Horse is about the legendary Loch Ness monster and a boy who hatched an egg bearing a baby creature of that ilk. Set in a Scottish manor house on the edge of the Loch, the scenery is spectacular, both land and underwater. This is a delightful family film, with a more serious underlying theme about the hardships of war, WWII, in this case. With the possible exception of Emily Watson, American audiences are likely to be unfamiliar with most of the cast. Alex Etel as Angus, the lad who befriends the water horse, and Ben Chaplin as the estate's handyman, and, of course, the eponymous Crusoe, steal this show, as they conspire to keep the little critter a secret. There is a series of comical scenes depicting the havoc wreaked by their failed attempts, and soon Crusoe has grown much to large to hide. Into the Loch he goes, to live the life he was meant to, but his very existence is threatened by the maneuvers of a battalion of artillery men who are charged with protecting the loch from German subs (really!)

3090440,4,B0012IWO0I,"""The Water Horse"" is a nice little movie that spins an entertaining, fanciful tale based on the legend of the Loch Ness Monster.  The boy at the center of the story, Angus, finds a mysterious egg on the beach in 1940's Scotland, and before he knows it, he's raising his own personal little creature (who doesn't stay little for long), which he names ""Crusoe"".  The story isn't terribly original from that point on (Angus works to keep Crusoe a secret, then slowly reveals him to a few people, and soon there's a major effort to avoid the authorities and get Crusoe safely out to sea, you know the drill), but it's all done with enthusiasm, sensitivity, and some exciting direction.

There are a few missed opportunities.  Initially, a point is made that Angus is terribly afraid of water, but when he needs to search the loch in a boat for Crusoe, and later, when he rides on Crusoe's back both above and under the surface of the loch, Angus is suddenly not afraid of the water.  There could have been a terrific scene where Angus makes a bold decision to overcome his fear of water so he can interact with his amphibious friend.  And the movie could have benefitted from another scene or two supporting the theme of Angus' loneliness and heartache over his missing father (lost in the war), which is a major reason he becomes so close to Crusoe.  But the issue is just kind of mentioned and dropped, instead of fueling some potentially good character scenes between Angus and his mother and/or other characters close to Angus.  Oh, well.  These missed opportunities aren't dealbreakers.

The special effects are very good, I'll say that.  The problem with CGI is that- well done or not- people immediately recognize it as CGI so there's never any more of that giddy ""I wonder how they did THAT?"" excitement when we see special effects anymore.  However, really good CGI at leasts generates a feeling of ""wow, that really looks amazing"", and ""The Water Horse"" has at least half a dozen scenes that accomplish this.  The water glistening off the baby Crusoe as he swims around in a trash can filled with water early in the movie, similar scenes later when a seal-sized Crusoe is hiding in a bathtub, and finally all the scenes in the loch when the dinosaur-sized Crusoe is giving Angus rides, attacking military craft, and just jumping around, they're all wonderfully done.

The two-disc DVD features the film on disc one, which looks and sounds great, with disc two housing a full array of extras features, including a 70-plus minute ""making of"" documentary.  Together, the film and extras will deliver decent entertainment for at least a couple of days.

With apologies to SOS by the POLICE

Just a lonely boy
Walking by the Sea-o
Finds a crusty egg
No one knows but he-o
It hatched and flopped around
And ate the kitchen scraps
Very soon the bath tub
Was too small for his flaps

He found a sea serpent by the shore
He found a sea serpent by the shore
He hopes that no one finds
He hopes that no one finds his
Monster name of Crusoe
Monster name of Crusoe

But soon his sister learns
And then the Handy man
Who has secrets of his own
And so the hatch a plan
They take him to the Loch
And he grows gigantic
Eventually he finds the sea
The Ocean called Atlantic

He found a sea serpent by the shore
He found a sea serpent by the shore
He hopes that no one finds
He hopes that no one finds his
Monster name of Crusoe
Monster name of Crusoe

Decades have come and gone
Since his monster swam away
For a pint or two of Ale
He'll retell his tale many times a day!

He found a sea serpent by the shore
He found a sea serpent by the shore
And now he tells his tale
And now he tells the tale of a
Monster name of Crusoe
Monster name of Crusoe

A very cute and warm family film that everyone should watch!

3090448,4,B0012IWO0I,"WATER HORSE is your basic ""boy and his dog"" movie except in the setting of 1940's Scotland in the midst of World War II, and instead of a dog it's the Loch Ness Monster. It's very predictable (boy gets attached to a pet and has to eventually say an emotional farewell to it) and has a simple plot, yet it's emotional and, at times, funny. It's also not so much a children's movie as it as an innocent movie for adults, in my opinion. Essentially, it is a children's movie but in a world of KUNG FU PANDAS, HANNAH MONTANAS, and whatnot, it may not have what it takes to get the attention of that demographic and may appeal more to fans of the HARRY POTTER series, LORD OF THE RINGS, and more Fantasy-based type of films. Also, being familiar with the Loch Ness Monster legend is a plus. With that being said...

The way that the Loch Ness Monster (or the ""Water Horse"" as it's called in the film) is presented in this film is that only one can exist per generation and that they are Asexual creatures. Before one dies, it lays a single egg that eventually hatches and the baby Water Horse has to live as an orphan and learn to adapt on its own. By chance, a young boy named Angus finds an egg, thinking it's just a big rock. He takes it home, and the egg hatches that same night. He tames the Water Horse and raises it without telling anyone. Eventually his sister and a live-in Handyman (an awesome actor named Ben Chaplin from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MURDER-BY-NUMBERS/dp/B00005JL29/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MURDER BY NUMBERS</a>) find out and collectively help Angus keep the Water Horse a secret from his mother (Emily Watson) and members of the Scottish Army who are taking refuge in their mansion of a home and are planning for an impending German attack (supposedly). But when Angus realizes that the more the Water Horse (which he names ""Crusoe"") eats, the more and more rapidly it grows, thus resulting in him having to make a heartbreaking decision by taking him to Loch Ness and parting ways with it so that it can be safe and live on its own.

Overall, I enjoyed WATER HORSE a lot. Like I mentioned before, the story IS predictable but it's well done and puts a different spin on the ""boy and his dog"" scenario. The cast is great and the characters are great. The young boy that plays Angus does a good job and isn't overly annoying like a lot of kids in movies have the potential to be. The bond between Angus and Crusoe is a strong one and creates for a more emotional ending. Also the fact that Crusoe has a NAME instead of being called ""Water Horse"", makes it more of an individual and gives it a character. To Angus, Crusoe represents more than a pet. It represents his best friend, it represents his child, and as Crusoe gets bigger, it spiritually represents his father who passed away while serving for the Navy. The Cinematography is beautiful and really takes advantage of Scotland's beautiful outdoor scenery. And the character of Crusoe is fantastic, thanks to the Special Effects artists who brought it to life. It has the mannerisms of a curious dog and is a playful creature, even as it grows in size. Some of the acting is a bit sketchy, mainly due to the smaller characters who only have a few lines of dialogue, but for the most part the cast does a great job.

The 2-Disc version of the DVD comes with a Behind-the-Scenes Documentary (77 minutes in length) that covers everything from the myth of the Loch Ness monster, the cast, the production, the acting, and the special effects. Plenty of cast and crew interviews. Also included are a few Deleted Scenes that have a total run time of only 6 minutes and 54 seconds. Other than that, there are no other Extra Features that have to do with the film, which is a little disappointing but is still enough to satisfy the Extra Features junkies who purchase this DVD. Maybe a proper documentary about the Loch Ness Monster? Overall, I highly recommend WATER HORSE to fans of Fantasy type of films and to adults who are looking to check out a simple, fun, and innocent movie for a change. Be warned: the song by Sinead O'Connor during the end credits is a tearjerker.

THE WATER HORSE: LEGEND OF THE DEEP has the look and feel of an overly cutesy flick with plenty of eye-candy, and that certainly is mostly the case. But it also has a lot of story behind it, too. And what I mean by that is it has several layers of varying stories all unfolding at the same time, something that goes a bit beyond the cute and fuzzy.

It is (no surprise to many) the story of Loch Ness and its infamous monster, but with a twist towards kids and a nod to ancient myth (which isn't very kid-like). The main thrust of the story is given over to a young lad named Angus MacMorrow (relative unknown Alex Etel) and his struggling family as they oversee a nice piece of property near the loch during WW II. Wandering around the shore one day, young Angus happens upon a strange looking stone that he picks up and brings home. Little does he know that what he's found is the rarest of the rare: an egg containing a water horse. He takes the egg into his father's shop (who is away fighting the war) and leaves it one night, only to discover it hatched the following morning. He tries desperately to hide this new creature from his mother, his sister, and an inquisitive but helpful handyman named Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chapin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B000EOTTTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>).

In the meantime we learn that the war is bringing a brigade of men to Angus' family's home; there to prevent German subs from entering the loch via the sea and threatening the Scottish countryside. Angus is forced to hide his new friend (yes, he becomes buddy-buddy with the water horse) from everyone but is eventually forced to release him into the loch as he grows at an incredible rate.

The dangers to the water horse are presented when he (it?) is mistaken for a submarine and is fired upon by artillery emplacements along the banks of Loch Ness. Dangers to the horse, Angus, his family, and everything they hold dear come crashing down as everyone learns (and sees) what Angus was protecting.

Probably most cutesy are the hugs and overly-friendly chumminess that Angus and his new dinosaur buddy have toward one another. But the special effects and scenery (I saw this on Blu-Ray disc) were fairly phenomenal. The colorful heather of the hills against the grayish skin tones of the water horse were impressive (noteworthy: Weta Digital did the special effects, the same company that did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;trilogy).

Surrounding these fantastical events are very human elements. Angus' family hides from him the fact that his father won't be coming home from the war; a heart-wrenching event for Angus considering the closeness he had with his father, and this makes his friendship with the water horse all the more important to the viewer and Angus (who will obviously soon learn the truth about his father's death). There is also a short side-story about Lewis, the handyman who shows up to help the family. Hiding his scars from the war, Lewis doesn't get along with many people, least of all the British Army leaders who are camped alongside the loch. The audience wonders if he's AWOL from the war but soon learn a much more important element about him. There is also the story of a mother trying to protect her family from the horrors of war, even as it sits down right in her own backyard.

The ancient myth that presses itself into the story is in reference to something called a ""kelpie"", a malevolent beast of Celtic lore that would disguise itself as a horse to lure unsuspecting victims to it. Once mounted, it would drag him or her down to their watery death. Like I said, not very kid-like.

But it was nice to see these additions to what could have been a simple huggy-huggy, kissie-kissie flick. The depth was needed and that, accompanied with some outstanding visual effects, bumped it up to an acceptable viewing.",1224547200,4,4097,5.014705882352941

The movie trailers made it look like a really cute take on the story of the Loch Ness Monster, and the monster itself (which is named Crusoe in the film) is absolutely adorable. However, I was left disappointed by this film. The plot is decent enough and the cast is pretty good, although Emily Watson's character was unbelievably annoying, and I'm usually a big fan of hers. In my opinion, Crusoe wasn't in the film as much as he should have been. The story was also kind of on the depressing side, which surprised me since it's supposed to be a movie for kids. The actor playing ""Old Angus"" and the two annoying teenage brats he shares his story with are also incredibly irritating, and I couldn't get past the fact that the Loch Ness Monster is supposed to be asexual, and that the filmmakers felt the need to go into detail about that in a children's movie. Finally (spoiler alert), I hated the end of the movie because we find out that Angus lives the rest of his life without ever seeing Crusoe again, and then we find out that the monster is dead! Sure, there's another water horse in another egg that's discovered by another cute, but who the heck cares?! Crusoe is dead! What a disappointing film.",1223683200,,1280,4.451063829787234

3090462,4,B0012IWO0I,"WATER HORSE is a pleasant enough, beautifully filmed family story, although the music and scenery can be a bit frightening for younger children.  The story is fairly formulaic for adults, but our children really enjoyed it--especially the interaction between the dog and the sea horse.

It is nice that it is not full of sexual innuendo, crass ""humor"" related to bodily functions, and injuries to the ""personal"" areas of the anatomy.  Most ""family"" films are anything but family friendly, so WATER HORSE is a nice exception.

From a conservative Christian standpoint, be warned that the children hide the sea horse and deceive their mother--without negative consequences.  A parent will want to direct the thinking of younger children in this area, but the kids otherwise exhibit respect for adults and as the protagonists, present a generally wholesome appearance and attitude.",1219449600,,878,5.287769784172662

I will say that this movie was far sadder and more depressing than I would have imagined.  Those looking for feel-good Disney fluff should turn away now.  There's not a whole lot of happy in this movie.  It has a very dark, depressing feel to it despite some of the more lighthearted moments (mostly starring Crusoe and Churchill).

The production keeps things just realistic enough that it has a bit more realism and teeth than the classic Disney family type fare it can be compared to.  The effects work for the Water Horse are quite good, and the creature is cute as a hatchling.

I'd missed seeing this in the theater, and some of the sequences, particularly when the Water Horse is grown must have been very striking on the big screen.  But they hold up well on a TV screen in the widescreen format, so I won't complain.

3090492,1,B0012IWO0I,"This was an incredibly boring movie.  Good for kids, thats about it.

Some really bad points:

It was sooooo predictable.  I don't want to list anything that was predictable so that it doesn't spoil anything you might just happened to not figure out, because it would most likely be the only thing you didn't figure out.  Regardless, everything in the entire movie you knew would happen minutes before it did.  Thats just poor story telling.  There really is no shred of a unique way they tried to tell the story, at all.

Typical characters and characteristics. The only interesting character was the handyman because he attempted humor (and failed) and he had some history to him, which, of course, they didn't develop.  I really tried to reason with myself by saying ""well they only have a couple hours for a movie, I guess they did good for so little time"" but I just can't think that, and so I don't want to lie to myself (or you subsequently).

So the story and the characters were horrible, can it be any worse? Nope.

Some good points:

Cast was good, they did a descent job. They sounded realistic so thats good enough for me. The music was good, I love scotish music.  And I liked the accents, love scotish accents.

If you like the typical family movie with a cutsie story then this is the movie for you.

3090495,4,B0012IWO0I,"As a big fan of the legend of the Loch Ness Monster, the new film ""Water horse"" brings the spirit as well as the excitement of the time honored legend to life like never before. Set in the era of World War II, the story takes place in the highlands of Scotland where a lonely young boy named Angus discovers a mysterious egg that turns out to hatch into a spunky and mischievous waterborne dinosaur known as the ancient Water horse named Crusoe. With his beloved father gone at sea fighting the German U-Boats and his mother and older sister not paying any particular attention to him Angus takes the orphaned Crusoe in and raising him as his pet. But Angus quickly realizes very early on that doing so and trying his best to keep the little creature a secret brings with it some rather unusual problems as well as, some comically outrageous misadventures along the way. For example, when baby Crusoe escapes from his water filled bathtub and encounters an aggressive Royal Army bulldog named, ""Churchill"" who chases him around the house and then eventually ends up wrecking a lavish evening dinner party hosted by the lady of the house and some promptly dressed British soldiers. However, the film is not without its tender moments and adventurous scenes of peril as the cold realities of a bitter war come to prey on the people and the isolated beauty of such a spectacular place.
Inspired by the children's book by Author Dick King Smith, the film's director Jay Russell whose past credits include such films as, ""Ladder 49 and Tuck Everlasting"" goes to great lengths to bring this wonderfully imaginative story to life. The DVD comes with some impressive behind the scenes documentaries and one of the things that I found most interesting was that Russell actually visited Loch Ness in order to get an idea of where to shoot the film. At first glance he didn't think too much about the famous legend but as he got closer to the water's edge he found himself looking at the pristine water with an opened mind that just maybe there could be something big and mysterious swimming the depths of the Scottish lake. The film and DVD features are definitely worth checking out.

3090514,5,B0012IWO0I,"What is unusual about this story is that while it involves a magical monster, the movie is really about the family, the situation, and involves the monster - the Water Horse - almost incidentally.  The story we see is a visualization of a story told in a pub by an older man in response to a young couple's comment about the famous picture of the Loch Ness Monster.  The story begins during World War II in Scotland at and near Loch Ness.  It is about a boy, Angus MacMorrow, who is terrified of the water and yet is drawn to it.  He finds a strange egg and when it hatches into a strange creature much like a miniature sea dinosaur with funny looking horn like knobs on its head, he befriends and cares for it.

Angus lives on a huge estate because his mother, Anne, runs the staff of servants for the absent Lord.  Her husband was lost at sea when his ship was torpedoed and while she realizes she is a widow, Angus keeps his father's workshop as a shrine and is determined he will return.  The army comes to the estate and sets up camp ostensibly to protect Scotland from an invasion of the German Navy from the North Sea into the Loch.  In reality, someone in power gave the commander this assignment to protect him and keep him out of the way.  The commander seems to be the only one oblivious to the silly nature of his mission and he treats it with a dangerous seriousness.  He also takes a shine to the widow Anne, and while she is flattered she has her son's troubles and running the estate on her mind.

Angus tries to keep the growing monster hidden and has to enlist his reluctant sister and the new handyman, the stranger Lewis Mowbray.  Eventually, the Water Horse has to be put in the Loch and Angus says good-bye.  But the connection between the two is too strong to be denied.  This is where the magical adventure begins and has a big part in transforming and saving young Angus.  However, the military inadvertently gets on the monster's last nerve and some very bad things ensue.  Of course, no one in the military takes Angus seriously, but it is up to Angus to aid the Water Horse and open his mother's eyes.

I will let you find out what happens in the story, but it is all quite well done.  Nothing that happens is too shocking, but is often quite touching.  The movie's effects are also quite well done and even impressive.  But I will point out again how impressed I was that they used the Water Horse well, but not as the consuming focus of the story.

While it is a family film, kids below eight may have trouble following the story unless they are quite bright.  The story has a number of threads that you have to keep track of.  Maybe little kids will get enough out of the effects and the slapstick with the dog and the military guys that they won't care that they aren't able to put everything together.

The acting is all quite well done and a cut about what we usually get in these kinds of fantasies.

Enjoy!

The only, and I mean ONLY, caveat here is that the Scottish accents may take a wee bit getting used to, but that's hardly a reason to miss out on this, the best family movie I've seen in a long time, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, period.  I won't repeat the basic plot info, as that already appears here on the Amazon page.  I would respond, however, to those reviewers who liken this film to ""Free Willy"" and ""E.T.,"" only to say that this movie is finer than either of those by my estimation.  It's far more sophisticated than ""Free Willy"" and has dimensions of meaning about love, loss and war that ""E.T."" could never hope to aspire to.  The acting is fantastic.  Emily Watson will break your heart with her quiet dignity.  Alex Etel, who plays the child Angus, gives a more subtle, layered performance than any child actor I can think of in any film.  You'll be surprised by the adult male roles here, played by Ben Chaplin and David Morissey; who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  The answer here is not so readily apparent.  Most of all, three cheers for the studio artists who brought Crusoe the Water Horse to life, from infancy through adulthood.  You won't believe your eyes; he appears as real as any living creature you've ever seen.  Finally, there's the script, which is intelligent, funny and deeply moving.  No cheap manipulative tactics here, no condescending to young viewers.  This film treats its audience with respect.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime treasure.",1211241600,3,1605,4.543554006968641

When his mother hires a handyman he takes over the workshop and disrupts Angus's life further. More so because Angus found an egg and it hatches into what appears to be a small dinosaur with flippers.

3090556,4,B0012IWO0I,"`The Water Horse' is one of those extremely good natured children's movies that just burrows itself into the viewers heart and makes for such an entertaining and memorable movie experience.  The graphics are superbly done, the acting is sincere and moving and the story is one filled with the wonderment of a children's fantasy but is also grounded with a sense of human truth that paints a very realistic picture of human emotion for the audience.  It's a children's movie that will touch the hearts of adults.

`The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep' presumes to tell the `true' story of Nessie; the Lock Ness Monster.  It tells us the story of Angus, a troubled young boy who is waiting patiently for his father to return from war.  In the opening scenes Angus finds a strange egg-shaped rock that's washed ashore.  He takes it home and leaves it in his father's old workshop only to return later to find that the rock was indeed and egg and it has hatched.  That's when Angus meets Crusoe (aptly named after the shipwrecked hero), a dinosaur-like creature who has an insatiable appetite for destruction.

Angus quickly forms an attachment to this cute little creature, but that friendship is threatened when a slew of Scottish soldiers get stationed on the same estate in which Angus lives.  On top of that, the new handyman that has been hired has taken over the workshop and has left Angus without a place to store his new pet.  Knowing that his mother with strongly disapprove of Crusoe, Angus enlists the help of his sister, and this new handyman Lewis to help him keep Crusoe hidden and out of harms way.  When Crusoe gets too big to store indoors though and is forced to retreat to Loch Ness, things begin to get dangerous, especially when a certain soldier gets the grand idea to hunt Crusoe down.

For the most part this movie was beautifully constructed and utterly charming.  The relationships between Angus and the people around him are real and fleshed out well.  His love for Crusoe of course gets the brunt of the films attention, but the realness of his love for his father is also a shining light in the film.

The acting is great here.  Alex Etel (from 2005's `Millions') is very capable as young Angus.  His performance is very controlled and believable.  I thought he was amazing in `Millions' and was delighted to see him in another great role.  Ben Chaplin is effective as Lewis Mowbray and David Morrissey is flawless as the good-natured yet rough Captain Thomas Hamilton.  Emily Watson (who is ALWAYS flawless) turns in a nice supporting role even though she isn't given too much to do.  She evokes real emotion and commands her every scene, especially her closing scene.  I enjoy Brian Cox quite a bit and thought that his small role here is quite effective.  He knows how to command your attention, much like Sir Anthony Hopkins can; just by simply being on the screen.

`The Water Horse' is a tad on the predictable side, and I found myself disliking the ending.  I enjoyed the fluid and charismatic way this film flowed up until the end where it began to resemble a certain `Free Willy'.  The ending still doesn't destroy all the good that this film does for the first three quarters.",1208131200,4,3213,4.672597864768683
3090557,5,B0012IWO0I,"What if the Loch Ness monster was real?  What if the `monster' was a verifiable mythical creature that living people today have seen, touched, and not photographed?

That is precisely the premise behind ""Water Horse"" from Walden Films, the creators of the Chronicles of Narnia.  Surprisingly, it works!  As far fetched as the idea of real monster is, the tasteful use of CGI helps create a stunning and richly textured film that all ages can enjoy.
The only detractor in the film is the `Free Willy' moment at the end, but besides that, it is a film that tells the story of Angus, a withdrawn young man who discovers an egg at the beach that hatches into something no-one knows about.  Or, at least until a handyman arrives with knowledge of Water Horses from Scotland.  Is Crusoe a water horse?

Perhaps.  The only thing Angus, his sister and the handyman know is that it grows every day.  Hide it in the shed.  Okay.  Hide it in the tub.  Okay.  But the fountain?  It's off to the loch and freedom for Crusoe.  Young Angus is taken under the wing of an ambitious military man and is taught discipline until his passion for Crusoe and the magic that the water horse possesses takes hold of him.  A family, once torn by loss, is united by a creature no-one believes in.
I loved this film.  It is reminiscent of the best family films of all time.  Walden Films has produced a landmark for the ages that will resonate with Nessie fans (is that photo a fake?) And those seeking good quality entertainment.

First, it features beautiful photography of the magnificent Scottish Highlands.  Add to this period furnishings of a Scottish manor house, and the clothing of the World War II era -- you might get a touch of nostalgia, but not enough to be cloying.

Next comes the character of the water horse.  From infant through toddler through teenager and on to adulthood, this animation is utterly believeable.  Movement and facial expressions are excellent.

Third is that the human characters are allowed to unfold over time  without the rigidity of simple stereotypes that so often characterize current films.  We see not only behaviors that define character, but are given the opportunity to understand the whys underlying those behaviors.

Fourth is the tale itself -- a timeless story that speaks to some instinctual yearning for true love and true freedom dwelling within the human spirit.

Time will tell whether this film has the pull to become a classic.  I hope it will.

3090563,3,B0012IWO0I,"This was a good story (from the book) made mediocre and pat by film-makers and with the added idiocy of gratitous violence.  Since when does family fare mean men machine gunning a child's pet?

The story couldn't be about the trials of dealing with such a huge wild creature in a domestic setting, no, they had to introduce guns and cannons shooting at the creature. The girl from the book is turned into a boy in the film (because the powers that be decree that girls will go to movies about boys, but we can't expect the reverse, even in the 21st century).

I could have done without the whole war subplot. First we have the animal machine gunned and bombed. Then we see the men who were so brave to go after the creature with machine guns turning into snivelling crawlers when face to face without their weapons.  Why is any of this necessary, or good family fare?

While the animation of the waterhorse is wonderful, and the creature brought to life most delightfully -- and the boy actor was quite good, even if a standin for the original girl - the storyline was just awful.

Rent this movie, don't buy it, and beware it's not for children of whatever age that would object to a lot of men shooting at or trying to trap and kill a child's ""pet"".  Not a movie for all children. 2 1-2 stars, for great animation, good music and scenery, but terribly bad script that suffers from the Hollywood idea that action requires shooting.  It's time for parents to just start boycotting this sort of pointlessly violent and damaging adaptation of what was (in the book) a good story.",1207612800,6,1577,4.489510489510489
3090564,3,B0012IWO0I,"Ok, I'll admit it, I didn't see this movie for the kids(I don't have any!). I watched it by myself. I love animals and the legend of the lochness monster I find really interesting. I was thrilled when I saw the preview in the theatre, but later decided not to see it because I form unnecessary attachments to fictitious animals(for the duration of the movie) and get really upset when they get hurt/die. So at that time decided it was a rental option only.
  The special effects were awesome and they gave an amazing realism to Crusoe, the water horse. From hatching to adulthood he was so real looking! I found some of the dialog to be..a little low(mumbling maybe) and the Scottish accent can be a bit hard to understand, I did fine with it but I think some kids might be bewildered by it. The kids in the film were super, their mom seemed a bit...stiff. That might be just how the actress decided the character was.
PLOT SPOILER AHEAD(Barely):
  My only concern was I found some of the missiles they were shooting into the loch to be really upsetting. For those kids who are too young to understand that Crusoe is digital, they might think this is a real animal getting nearly killed by missiles. So I didn't really love the war aspect of it to be honest. I found the best part of the movie to be the first 1/2 before Crusoe moves to the loch. After that, embarrassingly enough, I cried thru most of it (maybe I was just having an emotional moment, it's probably not a normal reaction!)but thank goodness the water horse survives, otherwise it would have been a really miserable movie for me.
  Anyway! I think it would be a fun movie for kids 8 and up, and the special features on the 2nd disc were great. They delve more into movie making and also the story of the Lochness creature.",1207612800,5,1788,4.419452887537994

3090568,4,B0012IWO0I,"In Scotland, during WWII, a lonely 12-year-old boy Angus (Alex Etel) finds an egg of the legendary Loch Ness monster. He takes it back to his home and keeps the creature when the egg hatched, unbeknown to his housekeeper mother (Emily Watson) and older sister. All these events are recounted by Brian Cox's character sitting in a local pub, telling his story to two young travelers looking at the famous ""fake"" photo of Nessie.

The ingredients of the film's story are familiar to us, but the way they are treated is slightly different. ""The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"" is a family picture, it is true, but you may find its tone uneven. The boy's relations with ""The Water Horse"" are almost overshadowed by the suggested rivalry between two males, Ben Chaplin's laconic handyman and David Morrissey's pompous army captain, the slapstick jokes of a bulldog and the creature, and the final chase scene that reminded me of ""Free Willy."" All these scenes and the actions are professionally done, but they also lessen the meaning of the bond between Angus, his absent father and his mother. Also, some children may find part of the film scary.

""The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"" is an entertaining re-telling of the famous legend. The landscapes are beautiful and the acting from the cast is all superb, especially Alex Edel and Emily Watson.

A near-tear jerker, set in WWII, on the banks of (we find out later) Loch Ness, this is a whimsical story of healing, full of adventure, laughter, friendship, and love.  The beginning is filled with an appropriate amount of tension, drawing the audience immediately into the tale.  As the story unfolds, we learn a little about Scottish folklore, a little about WWII behind the Allied front (way, way behind), and a lot about a young boy, who conquers his worst fears, helped by the love of his unique best friend.  In the end, they save each other.

The cinematography is simply breathtaking.  The location, the lighting, and the camera angles all work together to immerse the viewer in a rural Scottish village of the time.  The starkness of the loch and the beauty of the rugged land create a perfect setting for this film.

I have no idea how the creature was created.  I assume CGI.  But let me tell you, it really did look like the animal was swimming in a bathtub full of water - splashes, slop, and all.  I completely believed it.  Near the end of the film, I found myself yelling at the characters to save Crusoe...to the high amusement of my family.

I highly recommend this film for children of all ages.  You will not be disappointed.",1205280000,28,1472,4.515151515151516
3090570,5,B0012IWO0I,"A cute little movie, safe for all ages, I saw this one in the theater.  It is a fictional story about a lochness type monster.  A young boy in Scotland finds a big old stone and brings it back home to check it out.  He's called away from the shed (his daddy's workshop) and while gone, the stone (really an egg) hatches.  He returns to find an absolutely adorable, and very hungry, little creature that kind of looks like a small seal.

The story is set in WWII time.  The boy's daddy left to fight the Nazis in a sub.  A group of soldiers show up at the family estate to camp out and fight the Nazi's.  Note--this is not a ""fight-the-Nazis"" movie.  The soldiers stationed at the estate is just a sub-plot to WATCH for Nazis. They just set up a watch and fire some guns off (in case you are worried about your children seeing war scenes).  A caretaker type guy comes to help run the estate.  While slightly mysterious at first, the caretaker is a good guy.

Anyway, as the little seal-like creature eats, he grows.  He loves water too.  Unbeknownst to the boy's mother, the Water Horse is moved to the bathtub, then hidden in the toilet, and he keeps growing.  Eventually he gets to romping around the house and discovers the bulldog that belongs to one of the solders.

It's a story of adventure, friendship, and laughter as the Water Horse grows, gets into some antics, and (as you have probably guessed) gets too big for the bathtub and has to be released in the Loch (river).  His friendship with the boy leads to an incredible water adventure.

I am always happy to see a nice movie like this that a family can watch together and that does NOT have violence or sex in it.",1205107200,2,1676,4.351612903225806

3324250,4,B0012IWO0I,"The legend is only one water horse lives per generation.  When the old one is ready to die, they lay an egg from which the new water horse is hatched and must grow up on its own as an orphan.

In this case, a young boy named Angus McMurrow found the egg and helped the waterhorse hatch and grow.  That's not a mean feat, considering this is World War II and a cadre of British soldiers are staying in the manor house where Angus' family lives. But if any kid is in need of a friend, it's Angus.  You see, his father went off to war--and Angus still believes he's going to come back despite being told to the contrary.  Angus finds a surprising ally in Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin), a returning soldier who still believes in the old myths and is in need of a dream as much as Angus is.

Of course, the complication is the British soldiers led by a toff commander who's noble father probably stuck him in Scotland to keep him out of the action.  They think that the Germans are going to come down Loch Ness and they've got the guns and ammo to take care of the problem if they do.  Not a healthy environment for a baby water horse to grow up in...

""Water Horse"" is beautifully filmed.  It captures the rugged beauty of Scotland amazingly.  The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard (of Toto fame and too many soundtracks to name) is gorgeous.  The music is perfect--as always.

Warnings:

Kids younger than five had problems with some of the scenes and a couple had to escort their frightened parents out into the lobby",1200873600,56,1514,4.341637010676156
3324251,5,B0012IWO0I,"I'm surprised to see so many reviewers state that this is good only as a kids' movie. I thought it was great myself, and both I (at 34) and my daughter (just turned 6) loved this movie. It had both humor and serious themes, and both realism and fantasy; history and lore. I can't imagine how it could have been better myself. I like that it wasn't dumbed down for kids. We get enough of that and we're tired of it. We don't want to sit through that rubbish ourselves and we don't like our kids to be talked down to. This movie doesn't condescend. It basically shows a child in an adult's world, dealing with responsibility and loss... but strangely it is a feel-good movie. Highly recommended!

(To parents: you must know your child - it has some tense moments and atypical of the American kids' movies, people still smoke and say ""arse"", but not a lot. Also there is artillery fire by the English army who plays a somewhat negative role in parts, but is basically redeemed as their leader begins to believe.)",1199750400,3,1009,4.454054054054054
3324252,4,B0012IWO0I,"Imagine you're a young Scottish boy who's father is off fighting in World War II. Nothing's been the same since he left. You're lonely and you miss him terribly, but you find some comfort in combing the beaches for treasures left by the waves. One day in a tidal pool you find a large barnacle encrusted rock. Or maybe it's a strange shell. You take it home and discover your life is changed forever.

Thus begins young Angus MacMorrow's story. His rock turns out to be an egg, and the animal that hatches from it (he names him Crusoe after Robinson Crusoe) just might be the rarest of all creatures: a water horse. Legend has it there can only be one of them alive in the world at one time, and now Angus is faced with the challenge of keeping a secret who is growing by leaps and bounds. How can he possibly hide something this big?

Dick King-Smith has written several popular children's books, and this marks another of his novels made into a charming family movie (he also wrote Babe). It's been said that a lot of creative license was taken in this book to movie adaptation, so I approached The Water Horse strictly as a filmgoer.

The Water Horse could conjure up comparisons to Eragon for the egg-hatching-into-a-creature moments (Crusoe does look a lot like Saphira the dragon as a baby). But unlike Eragon, this movie is set in reality. Taking place in Scotland but filmed largely in New Zealand, the only thing of fantasy here is Crusoe. And that's quite enough.

Newcomer Alex Etel is perfect in the role of Angus. The supporting cast of Emily Watson as Angus' mother, Anne, and Ben Chaplin as a mysterious handyman who may or may not be a spy brought a depth to the film that adults will appreciate. You feel the concern Anne has for her children growing up in a troubled time of war, especially for withdrawn Angus who counts the days until his father comes home. To make matters worse, the Allied forces sets up camp on their property, making it impossible for this mother to shelter her children from it.

It isn't hard to believe a creature like Crusoe could actually exist, except for in one scene involving Angus riding on Crusoe's back. How the boy manages to hold onto the animal's slippery neck as they DIVE into the water and swim the depths of the Loch (not to mention how Angus held his breath for that long) is harder to believe. Children will eat it up.

Ultimately, like the good-old Disney movies of our childhoods, The Water Horse delivers on all levels. Sure, the plot was as predictable as the creature was cute. There's the typical black tie dinner ruined by creature mayhem, and a lot of angst over the water horse's safety, but that's exactly the way we want a movie like this. The Water Horse is a delightful romp through a child's dream come true, sure to please the whole family.

3324254,3,B0012IWO0I,"This is a kid movie. It is definitely aimed at the 8-14 set, and my son aged 10 adored it. It definitely captured his budding cryptid interest, and has set him in search of the book the movie's based on and all other things Nessie.

This did not need to be a kid movie.

This could have been the movie that straddled the gap between Narnia and Pan's Labyrinth. It would have been a delight, with a strong central plot and lots of character development among the secondary characters. The visuals are good, the water horse well realized. The background - well, it's Scotland. Craggy and beautiful.

Except some film idiot got a hold of it.

The movie, if just a shade darker, could have the same inspirational notes and themes. The same imagery, the same tonal moods in both score and visuals.

There is a place near my home that makes wonderful homemade old-style pies. She does not use the filling that is in a jar; there is no syrup in her apple pies. There is one drawback to her pies: After you've eaten one, you can tell when a can of goopy fructose is used to substitute for inferior ingredients or skill.

This movie could have been great, but I could not help but be annoyed at the heavy saccharine glaze. It was a little too obvious - the music swells noticeably when it's inspirational, the lightning flashes on the antagonist's face a little too cartoonishly. It is like taking a delighful pie and dumping fructose on it, like taking a natural beauty and covering thier face in cake makeup, like a finely crafted tiramisu and covering it in hot fudge.

Don't get me wrong - the goodness in all of those things does show through. It's a movie well worth taking your kids to, both to spur thier interest in things unusual and to have a fun time. It's just a shame that this movie wasn't made to its full potential - still accessible for kids, but not leaving adults with a saccharine aftertaste.",1199232000,4,1904,4.469740634005763
3324255,4,B0012IWO0I,"Crossing a tale between an explanation of the fabled Loch Ness Monster with the backdrop of World War II,  `Deep Water Horse' comes across as `Pan's Labyrinth' for children.  Full of whimsy and brimming with innocence, the movie is a harbor for the imagination.

Taking place in Scotland where the legend of Loch Ness has allegedly been spotted, an elderly man engages a couple at the local pub where he relates a fabled adventure of the past.  Transporting us in the narrative to 1942, Angus MacMorrow examines some ""magical shells"" around Loch Ness to collect and take home. His father has been absent from The War for about a year now.  Angus (perfectly cast as Alex Etel of `Millions' fame) spots one and takes it home to his father's workshop where he tries to pry through its exterior to find dazzling layers beneath.  Being called away, it is a short time later that noise in the shop alerts him of some new development.  Angus to his astonishment sees a creature waddling on the floor of his father's shop.  Looking much like a cross between a seal and a platypus, the awkward young thing soon takes a liking to Angus who feeds it and makes some space for him in a bucket of water.

The trouble is Crusoe, as he soon names him, grows very quickly.  Trying futilely to keep him from his sister, Anne (Emily Watson), his mother (Lorraine McDonald), and a newly hired hand, Lewis (Ben Chaplin), he, nevertheless, puts him in the bathtub.  Soon everyone except his mother is in on the secret, but once he grows too big, it is apparent he must let him go back to the water to accommodate his amphibious nature.

Enter the Scottish army.  While they laudably provided for the Allies, they do make life uncomfortable for Angus and will soon do so for Crusoe when they find his presence in Loch Ness. Captain Hamilton (David Morrissey) is a reassuring presence for his mother, who certainly could use a man around the house, but the changes are certainly unsettling for Angus, who needs Crusoe as a reassuring outlet and companion.  Crusoe is a nice escape for a boy who misses his father and must deal with a surrogate who knows little more than to say, ""The boy needs more discipline."" (In this way I saw the closest parallel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>.)

The scenes when Angus rides and befriends Crusoe are a highlight of the film, and the playful voyage is filled with nifty special effects.  Some of the chase scenes in the harbor and around the house keep a playful spirit to the adventure.  Like 'Stardust' and 'Enchanted' before it, 'Water Horse' is an entertaining and fun ride.  While some of the elements borrow a bit from the classic 'E.T.,' this film is original and transporting enough in its own right.

The actors and actresses were very skilled in their movements and facial expressions, it's well acted and the actors-actresses are all speaking with Scottish accent (home grown or not?).

3324258,3,B0012IWO0I,"When I saw the preview for ""Water Horse: Legend of the Deep,"" I was hoping it would be an entertaining, if kid-oriented movie. Well, at least it's kid-oriented.

An American tourist couple in a Scottish bar see the famous alleged photograph of the Loch Ness Monster. The man says that the photo is fake, and an elderly Scottish man says that there's more to the photograph than they think. So we flashback to the 1940s, and see the story of young Angus MacMorrow, who finds a large egg on the shores of Loch Ness. Out of the egg comes a mysterious dragon/dinosaur creature. Angus names him Crusoe. The animal turns out to have a pleasant disposition, and except for occasionally snapping at Angus and running through the house (and drawing the attention of the dog in the process), is generally very loveable. Crusoe, of course requires food and a wet environment, which Angus does his best to provide. Unfortunately, a division of the British Army, having reason to believe that the Nazis might try to invade Scotland via the shoreline where the MacMarrows' house is, come and station themselves there. So Angus must keep Crusoe a secret from the troops and everyone else. His sister does find out, however, as does the new handyman Lewis Mowbray. As Crusoe eats, however, he becomes too big to keep in the house, and Lewis and Angus decide they should put him in the lake. In the meantime, Angus's mother Anne finds her son's behavior erratic, and decided to put him under the supervision of the head of the garrison, Captain Hamilton. Angus cannot stop thinking of Crusoe, however, and goes off looking for him. Eventually Angus finds his ""pet"", who is now as big as a dinosaur. After Captain Hamilton fires  artillery into the lake, Crusoe is seriously frightened, and loses his friendly disposition next time Angus sees him. The rest of the movie basically consists of Angus trying to get Crusoe to have a happy time on  his own and getting him past the army's submarine net.

Kids (at least the younger ones) will probably enjoy ""Water Horse."" It has a nice (if predictable) story of a boy finding and befriending a loveable creature and trying to protect it. Unfortunately, there are far too many flaws for the movie to appeal across the age range. For instance, the movie takes way too long to get to the main plot development point of Crusoe being bombarded. Further, it's not really clear who the antagonist in the movie is supposed to be. There's a sinister-looking soldier that Angus sees a few times, but he really does not turn out to be a villain. Nor does Captain Hamilton. Some parts of ""Water Horse"" were not believable. For instance, the first time after Crusoe surfaces after being bombarded, he turns vicious, but then turns back to his old self, just like that. Finally, the scenes of Crusoe trying to get past the submarine net are way too cloying, not to mention them being a rip-off of Free Willy. This movie is good for kids, but to everyone else I would advise waiting until it's available to rent.",1198540800,3,3025,4.691148775894539

We had just listened to an Audible book version of The Waterhorse and my 9 yr old daughter and 4 yr old son really enjoyed the simple and well told story of a young boy living at the Scottish lock Ness, finding an egg that hatches into a mythical water horse, which he raises and eventually sets free in the lock.  .  My wife looked up the movie trailer and it looked fun, and more or less seemed to be consistent with the book.  It was not.  It is a perfect example of how hollywood can take far too many liberties with a story, turning it into a tense action adventure burdened with pathetic characters and cumbersome plot that did not exist in the book.  World War 2 soldiers marching around, cannons and machine guns firing at the water horse... pure dreck.  It seems that if a writer wants a better chance of having their screenplay being picked for movie production, even a children's story, it is a good strategy to inject content that is anti-German, Holocausty, violent, WW2 era propaganda.
The silver lining for our family was that this experience provided an opportunity to discuss what stories are, what happens to them as they are retold, how storytellers have agendas that they are pushing and how important it is to for us to be aware of this as we expose ourselves to media and to not passively swallow whatever is being shoveled at us.",1502496000,3,1414,4.5

3324292,5,B0012IWO0I,"The twin successes of The Fellowship of the Ring and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 2001 alerted studios that there was an audience for well-made fantasy films and a number of nicely budgeted films followed. Though fantasy films had been popular in the 80's they had almost disappeared for a while.. The Water Horse was one of the best of these and struck just the right tone between comedy and drama with the creature, named Crusoe by Angus, the boy who is the central character, morphing from adorably cute to almost frightening. Many child-and-creature films before had reduced the danger factor considerably until the films became silly comedies.

Budgeted at a healthy forty million, the film has fine actors, beautiful Scottish settings (and beautiful New Zealand settings standing in for Scottish settings), authentically detailed evocation of the World War II time period and great special effects from Weta Workshop, who did Lord of the Rings, that produced a lifelike creature that always seemed to actually be there. The film was supported by one of noted film score composer Jame Newton Howard's most exciting adventure scores which embraced the Celtic setting and included The Chieftain's along with the usual orchestra.

The result is a family film that all ages can enjoy, even parents and grandparents. The film accomplishes this by working as a character drama of a young boy missing his father who left for the war effort, his mother and sister who know he is dead but are fearful of telling the boy, the arrival of the British Army to protect the local Loch from German submarine intrusion, and possible spies and romantic tension between two men who have an eye for the widowed mother. That's a lot more backstory and context than many other fantasy films aimed at families, which tend to have stock characters and settings. Into all this, which could have made a movie itself with more writing is tossed a creature from Celtic legend, a water horse, a Loch Ness type of sea monster most often totally evil in the original legends, luring people, mostly children, to ride on it's back then drowning them. Here the creature is raised from his birth from an egg the boy Angus finds on the lake shore and so bonds with the boy in a rare friendship. As a hatchling Crusoe is cute, playful and apt to get into trouble-causing antics that provide comedy in the early part of the film. As a magical creature his growth rate is abnormally fast and soon can no longer be hidden in the house (the beautiful Ardkinglas House on the west coast of Scotland).

Alex Etel does a fine job playing Angus, a large role for a young boy to carry. Emily Watson is totally sympathetic as the mother and the supporting cast is believable in their roles. The film is both exciting and heartwarming and can be recommended easily to anyone inclined to like this sort of fantasy film.",1481932800,3,2887,4.781563126252505

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

3324409,3,B0012IWO0I,"Watched this on Netflix, and was fairly disappointed. This is the familiar story of a young boy who finds a fantastical creature, raises it, and tries to protect it from exploitation and harm.

The acting is not terrible, but many of the characters are cartoonish, and none of the critical characters have adequate development. There's a bit of romantic hinting, but no resolution. The sister, the mother, and other central characters just aren't introduced well enough.

Then there's the plot. It's somewhat forgivable, being a children's movie, but there are lots of plot holes and things glossed over.

OK movie for the kids, but there are many better options.",1458345600,,663,5.064220183486238

Just about the only thing this movie has in common with the book is its name.  I see the newest version of the book has a cover advertising how it is now a movie and I wonder how the author allowed this movie to be associated with his book.  The book is sweet and endearing and a good, clean read.  It has nothing to do with war at all.  The father isn't gone or dead; he is a sailor and returns from time to time and helps the family out with Crusoe. The family doesn't live in a giant mansion owned by some lord. They live in their own little house with the children's grandfather nicknamed, Grumble. Nobody tries to capture Crusoe.  He does not have to escape to freedom. If you've seen the movie, you're probably asking by now, so what in world is the book about???  Exactly.  Nothing is the same.  So this review is just for those who actually read the book first... just pretend the movie is a brand new piece of work, unconnected to Dick King-Smith's book, and maybe you will be able to enjoy it.",1457568000,,1165,4.259090909090909

3324495,5,B0012IWO0I,"The Water Horse is a tremendous children's story that ignites the imagination and fantasy that children often feel based on the AMAZING presentation.  This film is sort of similar to the Neverending Story in a way, but perhaps better because the special effects of the mythical water horse creature are more believable in this movie.  It also takes place during World War II.

It's about a little Scottish boy (Alex Etel) who stumbles upon what appears to be a strange rock near the sea.  Upon taking it home he begins to peel it apart with a knife and sees that it glows a mysterious light blue.  He chooses to hide it in the shed so his mother (Emily Watson) doesn't discover it.  She doesn't approve of pets... especially unexplainably humongous pets!  Well shortly after a huge rainstorm hits and Alex awakens to the sound of chaos coming from the shed.  He runs outside, opens the door... and sees that a mess has been created.  Turns out that rock was actually an egg, and a baby adorable water horse is running loose (and he's SO adorable!)

For the first half of the film it's all about Alex, his sister and a handyman played by Ben Chaplin that all keep the water horse a secret.  However this little creature has the ability to grow big *very* quickly.  I mean overnight he grows three times bigger.  He grows big enough that it's impossible to keep him in the house, so they eventually take him to the sea where he finds himself under attack by cannonballs because there's a war going on (World War II) and the soldiers are testing their weapons much to Alex's STRONG dislike and concern. Dodging cannonballs turns the monster very angry and defensive, even turning on Alex at one point.  This is where David Morrissey comes into the picture- a strict soldier that demands Alex be disciplined because his wild imagination is causing nothing but trouble around the home front.

I personally thought the first half was better.  Alex being a playful child keeping a mythical creature hidden around the house from his mother was more interesting than the boy riding around on this sea monsters back avoiding danger in the second half.  The first half is when the family bulldog gets into mischief with the sea creature, leading to a hilarious chase scene.  This is when people assume the bulldog is nothing but trouble but aren't aware of the presence of a sea creature being responsible for the bulldogs behavior.  The writing here, and the way the characters interact while developing their characters, is really good.  The second half is good too, but to a lesser extent.

There was another soldier that Alex sees that I thought would become a bigger part of the story because he had an angry look and it seemed like he was there to intimidate poor Alex, but he only appears a few times.  He should have played a bigger role.  Turns out the handyman has his own backstory and reason for being there.  He's a vital part of the story helping Alex with the sea monster.  At first when I saw the military drive up to this Scottish village where the boy lives, I thought something more significant was going to take place involving a war scene of some kind (hey I wasn't initially sure what country these soldiers belonged to and for a moment thought they were German).  But it turns out they're only at this Scottish village to relax in the countryside for a while.

Overall, a really well-told story that the children will probably love.  The acting, writing, story, characters, presentation (especially the presentation)... everything is spot-on perfect.",1443744000,,3562,4.710823909531502

3324504,4,B0012IWO0I,"The Good: This film caught my attention because it was based on an ancient Celtic legend, and I am unabashedly fond of old Celtic legends.  I wasn't disappointed; it's a very entertaining and touching story with excellent performances by Alex Etel (Angus MacMorrow) and Ben Chaplin (Lewis Mowbray) in the lead roles.

The scenery is incredibly beautiful.  While the rugged mountains around Lake Wakatipu in New Zealand aren't exactly the rolling hills of the Scottish highlands, it is suggestive of Loch Ness enough to carry the story along wile provding a wonderful backdrop for the movie.  The camera successfully avoids the snowcapped peaks of the Remarkables Moutains, so it really does look a heck of a lot like the terrain around Loch Ness.

The portrayal of ""Crusoe"" the water horse was so believable and realistic that I didn't even think about special effects until the film was over.  Then I looked up the credits and was not surprised to see that Weta Workshop once again delivered the goods.

The Bad: The film ends with unresolved plot elements, especially the apparent romance between Lewis Mowbray and Anne MacMorrow and the disposition of the British army emplacement on the MacMorrow farmland.

We're ignoring the geography of Loch Ness here.  Its outlet is a river that passes through the city of Inverness before flowing into Moray Firth and the North Sea.  This makes the entire plot scheme where the British army has gun emplacements and nets against German submarines invading Loch Ness quite nonsensical.  Compounding this error, the portrayal of the British army as clownish buffoons is outright offensive and out of place in this story.

The Ugly: I have to condemn Sony Entertainment for packaging this family-friendly film with forced previews of sociopathic hate propaganda disguised as children's animated movies.  Get professional help; don't pass your severe mental illness on to another generation.",1438646400,2,1930,5.167202572347267

What is keeping this DVD on my shelf, rather than trading it in, is the delightful English Bulldog in the story.  (And no, I don't have a Bulldog, I have a Border Collie and a Labrador).  This Bulldog gives a great performance as a spunky dog who regularly chases the Water Horse, though never actually does any harm.  A charming dog in a charming movie.

3324742,5,B0012IWO0I,"I have to admit, going into 'The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep' I was apprehensive. Right on the DVD and Blu-Ray cover it makes the bold claim that it is ""The most wondrous film of its kind since E.T.""  I scoffed, having in 2007 seen the trailers and passed Water Horse off as a shameless E.T. rip-off.  It turns out you can't always judge a film by its trailer.  Having just finished watching The Water Horse I find myself finding it hard to disagree with the cover's claim: in the sub-genre of children befriending extraordinary creatures The Water Horse may very well be the best since Spielberg's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.

Directed by Jay Russel (My Dog Skip) and based on a novel Dick King-Smith (Babe: The Gallant Pig) The Water Horse takes place in Scotland during WWII and follows  young Angus MacMorrow (Alex Etel, `Millions') who discovers a mysterious egg on the shore of the Loch.  Soon the edge hatches a aquatic reptile which Angus names Crusoe.  Along with his sister and hired handyman Mowbray (Ben Chaplin) Angus must hide Crusoe from his mother (Emily Watson) and the Royal Artilery regiment that has taken residence around his home (watching the Loch in case German submarines attempt to penetrate).

Now, if you were like me seeing the trailers for The Water Horse in 2007 you thought: ""Another E.T. knock-off?  Pass.""  And yes, the creature story elements of The Water Horse are fairly convention (scenes of kids hiding the creature from their mother, creature run amuck, etc.), but what Water Horse has over most films to follow Spielberg's footsteps is heart, and real characters brought to life by a top-notch cast.  This isn't just another E.T. clone: it is a coming of age story set in WWII.  The story of Angus raising Crusoe ties in wonderfully with the story of his father having gone off to war and carries weight not typically found in these films.  I've heard some complaints from people who feel it's a fantasy film slapped onto a period drama, but I personally feel the fantasy of Water Horse is a seasoning that brings out the flavor of the human interactions.

Performances are a solid across the board.  Young Alex Etel really does turn in a remarkable performance being able to perfectly share the screen with Chaplin and Watson.  I especially love the interactions with the Mulbury character.  Mulbury becomes aware of Crusoe early on so that it isn't just children hiding the creature from adults for 110 minutes.  Having an adult character's perspective I feel really helps draw older viewers into the magic of the story.  By helping the children hide Crusoe he shows a level of respect adults in this kind of film seldom do (usually adults only exist to scream and endanger the creature).

Of course this Water Horse wouldn't be so legendary if it didn't have the special effects necessary to bring Crusoe to life.  The technical wizards at Weta (The Lord of the Rings, King Kong) make the most of the film's $40 million budget and, quite frankly, turn in better effects than many films I've seen with three times the resources.  While the computer generated Crusoe can appear dated in some respects -either do to budget constraints or technological advances since the film's release--the character is incredibly expressive and radiates warmth and -when the film calls for it-- menace.  This is a great computer generated character from the best in the business and because of it the film will age better than most other contemporary family pictures released during the 2000s.  Scenes of Crusoe carrying Angus above and below the surface of the Loch are simply breathtaking and are sure to fill you with a childish sense of wonder.

If you have children or simply want a well-acted fantasy film I can't recommend this film enough.  It isn't without its flaws, but it more than makes up for them with its radiant heart and top-notch acting performances.  In a sea of mindless children's films which profit on crude humor and slapstick Water Horse is a genuinely heartfelt motion picture which I wish we'd see more of.  Many people -myself included- missed out on this film at the cinema in 2007 but I promise you this is a film worth sharing.

There is a kind of magic in the cinema, especially when seen through the eyes of children.  The Water Horse has that magic, and I know beyond reason of doubt that when I have children and they're old enough to watch their first movie films like The Water Horse are going to be at the top of my list.  It has its flaws, and is far from being a perfect film, but the more I think of the favorite films as a child the more I realize that very few of them are ""perfect"" in a traditional sense.  The Water Horse is just as flawed and enjoyable as many family films in cinema's history and it seems you either love it or hate it for that reason.  I've made up my mind and am giving this film my highest recommendation.",1388793600,,4903,4.677156177156177

My 7 year old found some of the high-drama scenes a little too scary, but there is nothing here that is too scary for the younger set IMHO.  I thought the music, the cinematography, and the acting were all superb, and the age-old story of a child loving and caring for a  creature just never gets old for me.

3324884,4,B0012IWO0I,"Crossing a tale between an explanation of the fabled Loch Ness Monster with the backdrop of World War II, `Deep Water Horse' comes across as `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>' for children. Full of whimsy and brimming with innocence, the movie is a harbor for the imagination.

Taking place in Scotland where the legend of Loch Ness has allegedly been spotted, an elderly man engages a couple at the local pub where he relates a fabled adventure of the past. Transporting us in the narrative to 1942, Angus MacMorrow examines some ""magical shells"" around Loch Ness to collect and take home. His father has been absent from The War for about a year now. Angus (perfectly cast as Alex Etel of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millions/dp/B000AP04GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millions</a>' fame) spots one and takes it home to his father's workshop where he tries to pry through its exterior to find dazzling layers beneath. Being called away, it is a short time later that noise in the shop alerts him of some new development. Angus to his astonishment sees a creature waddling on the floor of his father's shop. Looking much like a cross between a seal and a platypus, the awkward young thing soon takes a liking to Angus who feeds it and makes some space for him in a bucket of water.

The trouble is Crusoe, as he soon names him, grows very quickly. Trying futilely to keep him from his sister, Anne (Emily Watson), his mother (Lorraine McDonald), and a newly hired hand, Lewis (Ben Chaplin), he, nevertheless, puts him in the bathtub. Soon everyone except his mother is in on the secret, but once he grows too big, it is apparent he must let him go back to the water to accommodate his amphibious nature.

Enter the Scottish army. While they laudably provided for the Allies, they do make life uncomfortable for Angus and will soon do so for Crusoe when they find his presence in Loch Ness. Captain Hamilton (David Morrissey) is a reassuring presence for his mother, who certainly could use a man around the house, but the changes are certainly unsettling for Angus, who needs Crusoe as a reassuring outlet and companion. Crusoe is a nice escape for a boy who misses his father and must deal with a surrogate who knows little more than to say, ""The boy needs more discipline."" (In this way I saw the closest parallel to Pan's Labyrinth.)

The scenes when Angus rides and befriends Crusoe are a highlight of the film, and the playful voyage is filled with nifty special effects. Some of the chase scenes in the harbor and around the house keep a playful spirit to the adventure. Like 'Stardust' and 'Enchanted' before it, 'Water Horse' is an entertaining and fun ride. While some of the elements borrow a bit from the classic 'E.T.,' this film is original and transporting enough in its own right.

Directed by Jay Russell, ""The Water Horse-Legend of the Deep"" is yet another in a long line of ""E.T.-The Extraterrestrial""-wannabes (heck, even the two movies' titles sound the same) - only in this case the adorable alien from outer space has been replaced by the only slightly less adorable and certainly far more unwieldy creature known in folklore as the Loch Ness Monster. It's almost as if little Elliot had wandered into ""Jurassic Park"" instead of the forest outside his home.

The Elliot of this tale is one Angus MacMorrow (Alex Etel), a lonely lad living with his mother (Emily Watson) and older sister in a lakeside village in 1942 Scotland. Angus' dad is currently off serving in the war and the young boy counts the days till his planned return. One day, while playing in a local tide pool, Angus uncovers a mysterious giant egg which he takes home with him, only to discover that out of it has hatched a strange and heretofore mythological creature known as a water-horse.

Angus goes through the requisite routine of making friends with the creature, trying to hide him from the others in the household, frantically trying to save him from the military-industrial-complex forces out to destroy him, becoming all teary-eyed and emotional at their inevitable separation - in short, just about everything Spielberg did so masterfully in ""E.T.,"" and that has been so dishonored in the imitation.

Luckily, the movie does improve a bit in the second half, when the script turns away from the ""E.T."" parallels and towards the wartime aspects of the tale. But even here the military characters are largely two-dimensional in nature, with only Angus' mom and a newly arrived handyman by the name of Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin) providing any real human drama. The script by Robert Nelson Jacobs, based on the book by Dick King-Smith, also employs the cheesiest story-framing device of them all - the now-grownup character spinning the yarn to a spellbound audience in the form of an extended flashback - to tell its tale.

The special effects are wildly uneven, with some of the CGI looking mighty convincing and some of it looking like badly processed rear-screen projection from thirty-some-odd years ago. Moreover, one scene, involving Angus' activities with the creature in the water, is so utterly implausible that even a movie as based as this one is on asking the audience to suspend its disbelief can't quite pull it off.

Even with an original theme song written and sung by Sinead O'Connor, this aquatic a-boy-and-his-dog story is all wet.",1312329600,2,2561,4.958041958041958

3324908,5,B0012IWO0I,"When I first saw the commercials and previews for this movie, I wrote it off as ""another of those kids' movies"" and had no interest in seeing it.

However, recently my fiancee and I stumbled upon it and (for some reason) decided to give it a chance - I was glad we did! This movie has got something for everyone in it, and everyone can watch it: there is no swearing or sex in it, just a story (told from the perspective of an older gentleman in a bar) about Angus (who I would say is between 5 and 6 years old) who is struggling with loneliness after his father left to go fight in World War II. Angus also is terribly frightened of water, but one day he happens to find a big, mysterious stone-like object (later revealed to be an egg) on the shores of Loch Ness. Angus hurries home with the egg and hides it from his family in his dad's workshop. Angus lingers behind in the workshop for several minutes, prying off a layer of crust, scaling and what appear to be barnacles, only to find out that the item is, in fact, an egg, and it's breaking open.

The hatchling emerges and begins to ransack the workshop, and Angus is worried that it will make too much noise and be discovered. Around this time, a handyman (later seen to be a former British Navy sailor) shows up to do some work around Angus's mom's estate. At first Angus doesn't like the new stranger - perhaps because he feels that the new man will try to take his dad's place, or feels that the handyman will discover (and dispose of) Angus's new friend (named ""Crusoe"" after a book Angus sees on his dad's shelf). These feelings are quickly resolved, however, as Angus's new friend begins to grow quickly.

Crusoe is discovered in the bathtub (as Angus had recently discovered that the rapidly-growing creature loves water) by the handyman, but to Angus's surprise he embraces the creature and tells Angus some of the legend associated with it (that there can only be one ""water horse"" in the world at a time).

By this point, a garrison of British soldiers was staying in the estate as well, since they believed that German subs could ambush Scotland via the ""loch"", and had devised a system for ensnaring - and destroying - the submarines if any did show up in the loch.

Lewis (the handyman) and Angus take the enormous (by my guess, the size of an average house) Crusoe to the loch and slip him into the water. A British soldier spots the creature's head and neck (about the same shape as a periscope) and alerts his commander, who thinks that the Germans are coming. Angus and Lewis fight to convince the British otherwise, but is it too late? You'll have to see this movie for yourself to find out!

Very, very highly recommended - there's something in this movie for everyone, even though, on the surface, it appears to be aimed at a younger audience.",1305504000,2,2822,4.448742746615087

The Water Horse features a charming story that has been well told with the help of a smart director, fine production values, convincing CGI, an appealing soundtrack and a cast of stellar British pros (Emily Watson, Brian Cox, David Morrissey et all, and Alex Etel as the young lead, Angus). Also, the accompanying featurettes are quite informative. The Blu-ray version of the film does it justice.

Angus, painfully shy and at once fascinated and terrified by the water, is focused on nothing but the day his father will come home; it isn't till well into the story that we learn Charlie's ship was sunk nearly a year ago, though Angus isn't ready to admit, even to himself, that ""Dad"" is probably lost.  Then one day he discovers a strange object--a solid oval, encrusted with barnacles and other sea-wrack, under which it is a gorgeous iridescent blue--on the beach and brings it home.  It turns out to be an egg, and out of it hatches a small reptilian creature that Angus names Crusoe.  Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chaplin), the new handyman, identifies it as a ""water horse,"" of which, like the phoenix, there's only ever one at a time, and since it grows with a prodigious speed, he ends up helping Angus to get it into the loch.  But Crusoe is Angus's only real friend, and the bond is mutual.  When a regiment of artillery is billeted on the estate and a submarine net is installed at the seaward mouth of the loch, Angus's secret--and Crusoe's safety--are put in mortal peril.

Besides the truly touching relationship between Angus and Crusoe--who, of course, turns out to be the Loch Ness Monster--the best part of this movie is naturally the beastie himself, modelled on a sea lion in his earliest stages and a prehistoric pleisiosaur later on.  The animation--right down to the expressions on his face--is absolutely incredible, and his graceful leaps and dives belie his size.  There's also a lot of delightful humor as baby Crusoe gets into all kinds of mischief about the estate.  The movie is based on Dick King-Smith's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Water-Horse/dp/0375842314/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Water Horse</a>&nbsp;but improves greatly on the original (though I couldn't help thinking that if I'd been making it, I'd have added a Nazi submarine to the mix!).

3324921,4,B0012IWO0I,"A fantasy-drama released in 2007, The Water Horse is about the legendary Loch Ness monster and a boy who hatched an egg bearing a baby creature of that ilk. Set in a Scottish manor house on the edge of the Loch, the scenery is spectacular, both land and underwater. This is a delightful family film, with a more serious underlying theme about the hardships of war, WWII, in this case. With the possible exception of Emily Watson, American audiences are likely to be unfamiliar with most of the cast. Alex Etel as Angus, the lad who befriends the water horse, and Ben Chaplin as the estate's handyman, and, of course, the eponymous Crusoe, steal this show, as they conspire to keep the little critter a secret. There is a series of comical scenes depicting the havoc wreaked by their failed attempts, and soon Crusoe has grown much to large to hide. Into the Loch he goes, to live the life he was meant to, but his very existence is threatened by the maneuvers of a battalion of artillery men who are charged with protecting the loch from German subs (really!)

3324937,4,B0012IWO0I,"""The Water Horse"" is a nice little movie that spins an entertaining, fanciful tale based on the legend of the Loch Ness Monster.  The boy at the center of the story, Angus, finds a mysterious egg on the beach in 1940's Scotland, and before he knows it, he's raising his own personal little creature (who doesn't stay little for long), which he names ""Crusoe"".  The story isn't terribly original from that point on (Angus works to keep Crusoe a secret, then slowly reveals him to a few people, and soon there's a major effort to avoid the authorities and get Crusoe safely out to sea, you know the drill), but it's all done with enthusiasm, sensitivity, and some exciting direction.

There are a few missed opportunities.  Initially, a point is made that Angus is terribly afraid of water, but when he needs to search the loch in a boat for Crusoe, and later, when he rides on Crusoe's back both above and under the surface of the loch, Angus is suddenly not afraid of the water.  There could have been a terrific scene where Angus makes a bold decision to overcome his fear of water so he can interact with his amphibious friend.  And the movie could have benefitted from another scene or two supporting the theme of Angus' loneliness and heartache over his missing father (lost in the war), which is a major reason he becomes so close to Crusoe.  But the issue is just kind of mentioned and dropped, instead of fueling some potentially good character scenes between Angus and his mother and/or other characters close to Angus.  Oh, well.  These missed opportunities aren't dealbreakers.

The special effects are very good, I'll say that.  The problem with CGI is that- well done or not- people immediately recognize it as CGI so there's never any more of that giddy ""I wonder how they did THAT?"" excitement when we see special effects anymore.  However, really good CGI at leasts generates a feeling of ""wow, that really looks amazing"", and ""The Water Horse"" has at least half a dozen scenes that accomplish this.  The water glistening off the baby Crusoe as he swims around in a trash can filled with water early in the movie, similar scenes later when a seal-sized Crusoe is hiding in a bathtub, and finally all the scenes in the loch when the dinosaur-sized Crusoe is giving Angus rides, attacking military craft, and just jumping around, they're all wonderfully done.

The two-disc DVD features the film on disc one, which looks and sounds great, with disc two housing a full array of extras features, including a 70-plus minute ""making of"" documentary.  Together, the film and extras will deliver decent entertainment for at least a couple of days.

If you have all but the youngest children at home, this is a good family viewing experience.  There's nothing objectionable or too intense for the kids, and there's some decent acting and depth and craftsmanship for adults to appreciate.  Give ""The Water Horse"" a whirl and see if you agree.",1237852800,5,2947,4.745098039215686

With apologies to SOS by the POLICE

Just a lonely boy
Walking by the Sea-o
Finds a crusty egg
No one knows but he-o
It hatched and flopped around

Very soon the bath tub
Was too small for his flaps

He found a sea serpent by the shore
He found a sea serpent by the shore
He hopes that no one finds
He hopes that no one finds his
Monster name of Crusoe
Monster name of Crusoe

But soon his sister learns
And then the Handy man
Who has secrets of his own
And so the hatch a plan
They take him to the Loch
And he grows gigantic
Eventually he finds the sea

Decades have come and gone
Since his monster swam away

3324945,4,B0012IWO0I,"WATER HORSE is your basic ""boy and his dog"" movie except in the setting of 1940's Scotland in the midst of World War II, and instead of a dog it's the Loch Ness Monster. It's very predictable (boy gets attached to a pet and has to eventually say an emotional farewell to it) and has a simple plot, yet it's emotional and, at times, funny. It's also not so much a children's movie as it as an innocent movie for adults, in my opinion. Essentially, it is a children's movie but in a world of KUNG FU PANDAS, HANNAH MONTANAS, and whatnot, it may not have what it takes to get the attention of that demographic and may appeal more to fans of the HARRY POTTER series, LORD OF THE RINGS, and more Fantasy-based type of films. Also, being familiar with the Loch Ness Monster legend is a plus. With that being said...

The way that the Loch Ness Monster (or the ""Water Horse"" as it's called in the film) is presented in this film is that only one can exist per generation and that they are Asexual creatures. Before one dies, it lays a single egg that eventually hatches and the baby Water Horse has to live as an orphan and learn to adapt on its own. By chance, a young boy named Angus finds an egg, thinking it's just a big rock. He takes it home, and the egg hatches that same night. He tames the Water Horse and raises it without telling anyone. Eventually his sister and a live-in Handyman (an awesome actor named Ben Chaplin from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MURDER-BY-NUMBERS/dp/B00005JL29/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MURDER BY NUMBERS</a>) find out and collectively help Angus keep the Water Horse a secret from his mother (Emily Watson) and members of the Scottish Army who are taking refuge in their mansion of a home and are planning for an impending German attack (supposedly). But when Angus realizes that the more the Water Horse (which he names ""Crusoe"") eats, the more and more rapidly it grows, thus resulting in him having to make a heartbreaking decision by taking him to Loch Ness and parting ways with it so that it can be safe and live on its own.

Overall, I enjoyed WATER HORSE a lot. Like I mentioned before, the story IS predictable but it's well done and puts a different spin on the ""boy and his dog"" scenario. The cast is great and the characters are great. The young boy that plays Angus does a good job and isn't overly annoying like a lot of kids in movies have the potential to be. The bond between Angus and Crusoe is a strong one and creates for a more emotional ending. Also the fact that Crusoe has a NAME instead of being called ""Water Horse"", makes it more of an individual and gives it a character. To Angus, Crusoe represents more than a pet. It represents his best friend, it represents his child, and as Crusoe gets bigger, it spiritually represents his father who passed away while serving for the Navy. The Cinematography is beautiful and really takes advantage of Scotland's beautiful outdoor scenery. And the character of Crusoe is fantastic, thanks to the Special Effects artists who brought it to life. It has the mannerisms of a curious dog and is a playful creature, even as it grows in size. Some of the acting is a bit sketchy, mainly due to the smaller characters who only have a few lines of dialogue, but for the most part the cast does a great job.

The 2-Disc version of the DVD comes with a Behind-the-Scenes Documentary (77 minutes in length) that covers everything from the myth of the Loch Ness monster, the cast, the production, the acting, and the special effects. Plenty of cast and crew interviews. Also included are a few Deleted Scenes that have a total run time of only 6 minutes and 54 seconds. Other than that, there are no other Extra Features that have to do with the film, which is a little disappointing but is still enough to satisfy the Extra Features junkies who purchase this DVD. Maybe a proper documentary about the Loch Ness Monster? Overall, I highly recommend WATER HORSE to fans of Fantasy type of films and to adults who are looking to check out a simple, fun, and innocent movie for a change. Be warned: the song by Sinead O'Connor during the end credits is a tearjerker.

THE WATER HORSE: LEGEND OF THE DEEP has the look and feel of an overly cutesy flick with plenty of eye-candy, and that certainly is mostly the case. But it also has a lot of story behind it, too. And what I mean by that is it has several layers of varying stories all unfolding at the same time, something that goes a bit beyond the cute and fuzzy.

It is (no surprise to many) the story of Loch Ness and its infamous monster, but with a twist towards kids and a nod to ancient myth (which isn't very kid-like). The main thrust of the story is given over to a young lad named Angus MacMorrow (relative unknown Alex Etel) and his struggling family as they oversee a nice piece of property near the loch during WW II. Wandering around the shore one day, young Angus happens upon a strange looking stone that he picks up and brings home. Little does he know that what he's found is the rarest of the rare: an egg containing a water horse. He takes the egg into his father's shop (who is away fighting the war) and leaves it one night, only to discover it hatched the following morning. He tries desperately to hide this new creature from his mother, his sister, and an inquisitive but helpful handyman named Lewis Mowbray (Ben Chapin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B000EOTTTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>).

In the meantime we learn that the war is bringing a brigade of men to Angus' family's home; there to prevent German subs from entering the loch via the sea and threatening the Scottish countryside. Angus is forced to hide his new friend (yes, he becomes buddy-buddy with the water horse) from everyone but is eventually forced to release him into the loch as he grows at an incredible rate.

The dangers to the water horse are presented when he (it?) is mistaken for a submarine and is fired upon by artillery emplacements along the banks of Loch Ness. Dangers to the horse, Angus, his family, and everything they hold dear come crashing down as everyone learns (and sees) what Angus was protecting.

Probably most cutesy are the hugs and overly-friendly chumminess that Angus and his new dinosaur buddy have toward one another. But the special effects and scenery (I saw this on Blu-Ray disc) were fairly phenomenal. The colorful heather of the hills against the grayish skin tones of the water horse were impressive (noteworthy: Weta Digital did the special effects, the same company that did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;trilogy).

Surrounding these fantastical events are very human elements. Angus' family hides from him the fact that his father won't be coming home from the war; a heart-wrenching event for Angus considering the closeness he had with his father, and this makes his friendship with the water horse all the more important to the viewer and Angus (who will obviously soon learn the truth about his father's death). There is also a short side-story about Lewis, the handyman who shows up to help the family. Hiding his scars from the war, Lewis doesn't get along with many people, least of all the British Army leaders who are camped alongside the loch. The audience wonders if he's AWOL from the war but soon learn a much more important element about him. There is also the story of a mother trying to protect her family from the horrors of war, even as it sits down right in her own backyard.

The ancient myth that presses itself into the story is in reference to something called a ""kelpie"", a malevolent beast of Celtic lore that would disguise itself as a horse to lure unsuspecting victims to it. Once mounted, it would drag him or her down to their watery death. Like I said, not very kid-like.

But it was nice to see these additions to what could have been a simple huggy-huggy, kissie-kissie flick. The depth was needed and that, accompanied with some outstanding visual effects, bumped it up to an acceptable viewing.",1224547200,4,4097,5.014705882352941

The movie trailers made it look like a really cute take on the story of the Loch Ness Monster, and the monster itself (which is named Crusoe in the film) is absolutely adorable. However, I was left disappointed by this film. The plot is decent enough and the cast is pretty good, although Emily Watson's character was unbelievably annoying, and I'm usually a big fan of hers. In my opinion, Crusoe wasn't in the film as much as he should have been. The story was also kind of on the depressing side, which surprised me since it's supposed to be a movie for kids. The actor playing ""Old Angus"" and the two annoying teenage brats he shares his story with are also incredibly irritating, and I couldn't get past the fact that the Loch Ness Monster is supposed to be asexual, and that the filmmakers felt the need to go into detail about that in a children's movie. Finally (spoiler alert), I hated the end of the movie because we find out that Angus lives the rest of his life without ever seeing Crusoe again, and then we find out that the monster is dead! Sure, there's another water horse in another egg that's discovered by another cute, but who the heck cares?! Crusoe is dead! What a disappointing film.",1223683200,,1280,4.451063829787234

It is nice that it is not full of sexual innuendo, crass ""humor"" related to bodily functions, and injuries to the ""personal"" areas of the anatomy.  Most ""family"" films are anything but family friendly, so WATER HORSE is a nice exception.

I will say that this movie was far sadder and more depressing than I would have imagined.  Those looking for feel-good Disney fluff should turn away now.  There's not a whole lot of happy in this movie.  It has a very dark, depressing feel to it despite some of the more lighthearted moments (mostly starring Crusoe and Churchill).

Some really bad points:

It was sooooo predictable.  I don't want to list anything that was predictable so that it doesn't spoil anything you might just happened to not figure out, because it would most likely be the only thing you didn't figure out.  Regardless, everything in the entire movie you knew would happen minutes before it did.  Thats just poor story telling.  There really is no shred of a unique way they tried to tell the story, at all.

Typical characters and characteristics. The only interesting character was the handyman because he attempted humor (and failed) and he had some history to him, which, of course, they didn't develop.  I really tried to reason with myself by saying ""well they only have a couple hours for a movie, I guess they did good for so little time"" but I just can't think that, and so I don't want to lie to myself (or you subsequently).

So the story and the characters were horrible, can it be any worse? Nope.

Some good points:

Cast was good, they did a descent job. They sounded realistic so thats good enough for me. The music was good, I love scotish music.  And I liked the accents, love scotish accents.

If you like the typical family movie with a cutsie story then this is the movie for you.  If you do not want something that you can watch for ten minutes and know the whole story, then don't get this. Simple as that.  There are plenty of other good childrens movies that either a) the adults also can enjoy, or b) aren't anywhere near as predictable.",1213574400,4,1577,4.5

3324992,4,B0012IWO0I,"As a big fan of the legend of the Loch Ness Monster, the new film ""Water horse"" brings the spirit as well as the excitement of the time honored legend to life like never before. Set in the era of World War II, the story takes place in the highlands of Scotland where a lonely young boy named Angus discovers a mysterious egg that turns out to hatch into a spunky and mischievous waterborne dinosaur known as the ancient Water horse named Crusoe. With his beloved father gone at sea fighting the German U-Boats and his mother and older sister not paying any particular attention to him Angus takes the orphaned Crusoe in and raising him as his pet. But Angus quickly realizes very early on that doing so and trying his best to keep the little creature a secret brings with it some rather unusual problems as well as, some comically outrageous misadventures along the way. For example, when baby Crusoe escapes from his water filled bathtub and encounters an aggressive Royal Army bulldog named, ""Churchill"" who chases him around the house and then eventually ends up wrecking a lavish evening dinner party hosted by the lady of the house and some promptly dressed British soldiers. However, the film is not without its tender moments and adventurous scenes of peril as the cold realities of a bitter war come to prey on the people and the isolated beauty of such a spectacular place.
Inspired by the children's book by Author Dick King Smith, the film's director Jay Russell whose past credits include such films as, ""Ladder 49 and Tuck Everlasting"" goes to great lengths to bring this wonderfully imaginative story to life. The DVD comes with some impressive behind the scenes documentaries and one of the things that I found most interesting was that Russell actually visited Loch Ness in order to get an idea of where to shoot the film. At first glance he didn't think too much about the famous legend but as he got closer to the water's edge he found himself looking at the pristine water with an opened mind that just maybe there could be something big and mysterious swimming the depths of the Scottish lake. The film and DVD features are definitely worth checking out. If you're a fan of fantasy films or just like a story that let's you're imagination run wild, this movie is for you.",1213315200,4,2291,4.659259259259259

3325011,5,B0012IWO0I,"What is unusual about this story is that while it involves a magical monster, the movie is really about the family, the situation, and involves the monster - the Water Horse - almost incidentally.  The story we see is a visualization of a story told in a pub by an older man in response to a young couple's comment about the famous picture of the Loch Ness Monster.  The story begins during World War II in Scotland at and near Loch Ness.  It is about a boy, Angus MacMorrow, who is terrified of the water and yet is drawn to it.  He finds a strange egg and when it hatches into a strange creature much like a miniature sea dinosaur with funny looking horn like knobs on its head, he befriends and cares for it.

Angus lives on a huge estate because his mother, Anne, runs the staff of servants for the absent Lord.  Her husband was lost at sea when his ship was torpedoed and while she realizes she is a widow, Angus keeps his father's workshop as a shrine and is determined he will return.  The army comes to the estate and sets up camp ostensibly to protect Scotland from an invasion of the German Navy from the North Sea into the Loch.  In reality, someone in power gave the commander this assignment to protect him and keep him out of the way.  The commander seems to be the only one oblivious to the silly nature of his mission and he treats it with a dangerous seriousness.  He also takes a shine to the widow Anne, and while she is flattered she has her son's troubles and running the estate on her mind.

Angus tries to keep the growing monster hidden and has to enlist his reluctant sister and the new handyman, the stranger Lewis Mowbray.  Eventually, the Water Horse has to be put in the Loch and Angus says good-bye.  But the connection between the two is too strong to be denied.  This is where the magical adventure begins and has a big part in transforming and saving young Angus.  However, the military inadvertently gets on the monster's last nerve and some very bad things ensue.  Of course, no one in the military takes Angus seriously, but it is up to Angus to aid the Water Horse and open his mother's eyes.

I will let you find out what happens in the story, but it is all quite well done.  Nothing that happens is too shocking, but is often quite touching.  The movie's effects are also quite well done and even impressive.  But I will point out again how impressed I was that they used the Water Horse well, but not as the consuming focus of the story.

While it is a family film, kids below eight may have trouble following the story unless they are quite bright.  The story has a number of threads that you have to keep track of.  Maybe little kids will get enough out of the effects and the slapstick with the dog and the military guys that they won't care that they aren't able to put everything together.

The acting is all quite well done and a cut about what we usually get in these kinds of fantasies.

Enjoy!

The only, and I mean ONLY, caveat here is that the Scottish accents may take a wee bit getting used to, but that's hardly a reason to miss out on this, the best family movie I've seen in a long time, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, period.  I won't repeat the basic plot info, as that already appears here on the Amazon page.  I would respond, however, to those reviewers who liken this film to ""Free Willy"" and ""E.T.,"" only to say that this movie is finer than either of those by my estimation.  It's far more sophisticated than ""Free Willy"" and has dimensions of meaning about love, loss and war that ""E.T."" could never hope to aspire to.  The acting is fantastic.  Emily Watson will break your heart with her quiet dignity.  Alex Etel, who plays the child Angus, gives a more subtle, layered performance than any child actor I can think of in any film.  You'll be surprised by the adult male roles here, played by Ben Chaplin and David Morissey; who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  The answer here is not so readily apparent.  Most of all, three cheers for the studio artists who brought Crusoe the Water Horse to life, from infancy through adulthood.  You won't believe your eyes; he appears as real as any living creature you've ever seen.  Finally, there's the script, which is intelligent, funny and deeply moving.

3325053,4,B0012IWO0I,"`The Water Horse' is one of those extremely good natured children's movies that just burrows itself into the viewers heart and makes for such an entertaining and memorable movie experience.  The graphics are superbly done, the acting is sincere and moving and the story is one filled with the wonderment of a children's fantasy but is also grounded with a sense of human truth that paints a very realistic picture of human emotion for the audience.  It's a children's movie that will touch the hearts of adults.

`The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep' presumes to tell the `true' story of Nessie; the Lock Ness Monster.  It tells us the story of Angus, a troubled young boy who is waiting patiently for his father to return from war.  In the opening scenes Angus finds a strange egg-shaped rock that's washed ashore.  He takes it home and leaves it in his father's old workshop only to return later to find that the rock was indeed and egg and it has hatched.  That's when Angus meets Crusoe (aptly named after the shipwrecked hero), a dinosaur-like creature who has an insatiable appetite for destruction.

Angus quickly forms an attachment to this cute little creature, but that friendship is threatened when a slew of Scottish soldiers get stationed on the same estate in which Angus lives.  On top of that, the new handyman that has been hired has taken over the workshop and has left Angus without a place to store his new pet.  Knowing that his mother with strongly disapprove of Crusoe, Angus enlists the help of his sister, and this new handyman Lewis to help him keep Crusoe hidden and out of harms way.  When Crusoe gets too big to store indoors though and is forced to retreat to Loch Ness, things begin to get dangerous, especially when a certain soldier gets the grand idea to hunt Crusoe down.

For the most part this movie was beautifully constructed and utterly charming.  The relationships between Angus and the people around him are real and fleshed out well.  His love for Crusoe of course gets the brunt of the films attention, but the realness of his love for his father is also a shining light in the film.

The acting is great here.  Alex Etel (from 2005's `Millions') is very capable as young Angus.  His performance is very controlled and believable.  I thought he was amazing in `Millions' and was delighted to see him in another great role.  Ben Chaplin is effective as Lewis Mowbray and David Morrissey is flawless as the good-natured yet rough Captain Thomas Hamilton.  Emily Watson (who is ALWAYS flawless) turns in a nice supporting role even though she isn't given too much to do.  She evokes real emotion and commands her every scene, especially her closing scene.  I enjoy Brian Cox quite a bit and thought that his small role here is quite effective.  He knows how to command your attention, much like Sir Anthony Hopkins can; just by simply being on the screen.

`The Water Horse' is a tad on the predictable side, and I found myself disliking the ending.  I enjoyed the fluid and charismatic way this film flowed up until the end where it began to resemble a certain `Free Willy'.  The ending still doesn't destroy all the good that this film does for the first three quarters.",1208131200,4,3213,4.672597864768683
3325054,5,B0012IWO0I,"What if the Loch Ness monster was real?  What if the `monster' was a verifiable mythical creature that living people today have seen, touched, and not photographed?

That is precisely the premise behind ""Water Horse"" from Walden Films, the creators of the Chronicles of Narnia.  Surprisingly, it works!  As far fetched as the idea of real monster is, the tasteful use of CGI helps create a stunning and richly textured film that all ages can enjoy.
The only detractor in the film is the `Free Willy' moment at the end, but besides that, it is a film that tells the story of Angus, a withdrawn young man who discovers an egg at the beach that hatches into something no-one knows about.  Or, at least until a handyman arrives with knowledge of Water Horses from Scotland.  Is Crusoe a water horse?

Perhaps.  The only thing Angus, his sister and the handyman know is that it grows every day.  Hide it in the shed.  Okay.  Hide it in the tub.  Okay.  But the fountain?  It's off to the loch and freedom for Crusoe.  Young Angus is taken under the wing of an ambitious military man and is taught discipline until his passion for Crusoe and the magic that the water horse possesses takes hold of him.  A family, once torn by loss, is united by a creature no-one believes in.
I loved this film.  It is reminiscent of the best family films of all time.  Walden Films has produced a landmark for the ages that will resonate with Nessie fans (is that photo a fake?) And those seeking good quality entertainment.

First, it features beautiful photography of the magnificent Scottish Highlands.  Add to this period furnishings of a Scottish manor house, and the clothing of the World War II era -- you might get a touch of nostalgia, but not enough to be cloying.

Next comes the character of the water horse.  From infant through toddler through teenager and on to adulthood, this animation is utterly believeable.  Movement and facial expressions are excellent.

Third is that the human characters are allowed to unfold over time  without the rigidity of simple stereotypes that so often characterize current films.  We see not only behaviors that define character, but are given the opportunity to understand the whys underlying those behaviors.

Fourth is the tale itself -- a timeless story that speaks to some instinctual yearning for true love and true freedom dwelling within the human spirit.

Time will tell whether this film has the pull to become a classic.  I hope it will.

3325060,3,B0012IWO0I,"This was a good story (from the book) made mediocre and pat by film-makers and with the added idiocy of gratitous violence.  Since when does family fare mean men machine gunning a child's pet?

The story couldn't be about the trials of dealing with such a huge wild creature in a domestic setting, no, they had to introduce guns and cannons shooting at the creature. The girl from the book is turned into a boy in the film (because the powers that be decree that girls will go to movies about boys, but we can't expect the reverse, even in the 21st century).

I could have done without the whole war subplot. First we have the animal machine gunned and bombed. Then we see the men who were so brave to go after the creature with machine guns turning into snivelling crawlers when face to face without their weapons.  Why is any of this necessary, or good family fare?

While the animation of the waterhorse is wonderful, and the creature brought to life most delightfully -- and the boy actor was quite good, even if a standin for the original girl - the storyline was just awful.

Rent this movie, don't buy it, and beware it's not for children of whatever age that would object to a lot of men shooting at or trying to trap and kill a child's ""pet"".  Not a movie for all children. 2 1-2 stars, for great animation, good music and scenery, but terribly bad script that suffers from the Hollywood idea that action requires shooting.

I love animals and the legend of the lochness monster I find really interesting. I was thrilled when I saw the preview in the theatre, but later decided not to see it because I form unnecessary attachments to fictitious animals(for the duration of the movie) and get really upset when they get hurt/die. So at that time decided it was a rental option only.
  The special effects were awesome and they gave an amazing realism to Crusoe, the water horse. From hatching to adulthood he was so real looking! I found some of the dialog to be..a little low(mumbling maybe) and the Scottish accent can be a bit hard to understand, I did fine with it but I think some kids might be bewildered by it. The kids in the film were super, their mom seemed a bit...stiff. That might be just how the actress decided the character was.
PLOT SPOILER AHEAD(Barely):
  My only concern was I found some of the missiles they were shooting into the loch to be really upsetting. For those kids who are too young to understand that Crusoe is digital, they might think this is a real animal getting nearly killed by missiles. So I didn't really love the war aspect of it to be honest. I found the best part of the movie to be the first 1/2 before Crusoe moves to the loch. After that, embarrassingly enough, I cried thru most of it (maybe I was just having an emotional moment, it's probably not a normal reaction!)but thank goodness the water horse survives, otherwise it would have been a really miserable movie for me.
  Anyway! I think it would be a fun movie for kids 8 and up, and the special features on the 2nd disc were great. They delve more into movie making and also the story of the Lochness creature.",1207612800,5,1788,4.419452887537994
3325062,1,B0012IWO0I,"In the book the main character is the sister.  The change to a boy was not lost on my 10-year-old daughter, who lost interest in seeing the movie once she figured out from the previews that the sister lost out on the story.  I don't see any reason for the big change - did they think no one would have actually read the book ?",1207526400,10,326,4.0
3325063,5,B0012IWO0I,"This is a delightful movie.  The characters are genuine and the story is entertaining for children and adults alike.  Taking a legend and building a movie around it may not be a new idea, but this movie was done in such a way that it is believable throughout, even though it is all fiction.  The movie was both entertaining and intriguing.  The only thing I suspected all along was the identity of the old man telling the story.  The rest was just a darn good movie.",1206057600,3,466,4.372093023255814
3325064,3,B0012IWO0I,"The movie centered more on the friendship of the mythical creature and that German kid Angus.  The story was dragging at first but became interesting when he was too big to be domesticated and was put out in the lake.  The creature though looked more like a puppet than a dinosaur. Watching this made me remember Free Willy specially when Crusoe (the creature) jumped out of the water doing a twist to clear the net.

This one is good for a single watch though. Rent first before deciding to buy this DVD.",1205971200,,505,4.467391304347826
3325065,4,B0012IWO0I,"In Scotland, during WWII, a lonely 12-year-old boy Angus (Alex Etel) finds an egg of the legendary Loch Ness monster. He takes it back to his home and keeps the creature when the egg hatched, unbeknown to his housekeeper mother (Emily Watson) and older sister. All these events are recounted by Brian Cox's character sitting in a local pub, telling his story to two young travelers looking at the famous ""fake"" photo of Nessie.

The ingredients of the film's story are familiar to us, but the way they are treated is slightly different. ""The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"" is a family picture, it is true, but you may find its tone uneven. The boy's relations with ""The Water Horse"" are almost overshadowed by the suggested rivalry between two males, Ben Chaplin's laconic handyman and David Morrissey's pompous army captain, the slapstick jokes of a bulldog and the creature, and the final chase scene that reminded me of ""Free Willy."" All these scenes and the actions are professionally done, but they also lessen the meaning of the bond between Angus, his absent father and his mother. Also, some children may find part of the film scary.

""The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"" is an entertaining re-telling of the famous legend. The landscapes are beautiful and the acting from the cast is all superb, especially Alex Edel and Emily Watson. With a simpler story the film would have been as good as it is, or perhaps better.",1205366400,2,1429,4.758064516129032
3325066,5,B0012IWO0I,"I just saw this film with my husband and 10  year old daughter...excuse me, she says 10 .  The Water Horse was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  It is a treat for the entire family, sparking the imagination of young and old alike.

A near-tear jerker, set in WWII, on the banks of (we find out later) Loch Ness, this is a whimsical story of healing, full of adventure, laughter, friendship, and love.  The beginning is filled with an appropriate amount of tension, drawing the audience immediately into the tale.  As the story unfolds, we learn a little about Scottish folklore, a little about WWII behind the Allied front (way, way behind), and a lot about a young boy, who conquers his worst fears, helped by the love of his unique best friend.  In the end, they save each other.

The cinematography is simply breathtaking.  The location, the lighting, and the camera angles all work together to immerse the viewer in a rural Scottish village of the time.  The starkness of the loch and the beauty of the rugged land create a perfect setting for this film.

I have no idea how the creature was created.  I assume CGI.  But let me tell you, it really did look like the animal was swimming in a bathtub full of water - splashes, slop, and all.  I completely believed it.  Near the end of the film, I found myself yelling at the characters to save Crusoe...to the high amusement of my family.

I highly recommend this film for children of all ages.  You will not be disappointed.",1205280000,28,1472,4.515151515151516
3325067,5,B0012IWO0I,"A cute little movie, safe for all ages, I saw this one in the theater.  It is a fictional story about a lochness type monster.  A young boy in Scotland finds a big old stone and brings it back home to check it out.  He's called away from the shed (his daddy's workshop) and while gone, the stone (really an egg) hatches.  He returns to find an absolutely adorable, and very hungry, little creature that kind of looks like a small seal.

The story is set in WWII time.  The boy's daddy left to fight the Nazis in a sub.  A group of soldiers show up at the family estate to camp out and fight the Nazi's.  Note--this is not a ""fight-the-Nazis"" movie.  The soldiers stationed at the estate is just a sub-plot to WATCH for Nazis. They just set up a watch and fire some guns off (in case you are worried about your children seeing war scenes).  A caretaker type guy comes to help run the estate.  While slightly mysterious at first, the caretaker is a good guy.

Anyway, as the little seal-like creature eats, he grows.  He loves water too.  Unbeknownst to the boy's mother, the Water Horse is moved to the bathtub, then hidden in the toilet, and he keeps growing.  Eventually he gets to romping around the house and discovers the bulldog that belongs to one of the solders.

It's a story of adventure, friendship, and laughter as the Water Horse grows, gets into some antics, and (as you have probably guessed) gets too big for the bathtub and has to be released in the Loch (river).  His friendship with the boy leads to an incredible water adventure.

I am always happy to see a nice movie like this that a family can watch together and that does NOT have violence or sex in it.",1205107200,2,1676,4.351612903225806
3325068,5,B0012IWO0I,"Our family found this movie to be wonderful. Not only was it engaging enough to be very entertaining for adults, but all of the children in the theater were enthralled.

8246080,1,B0012IWO0I,"The premise was wonderful and I loved the first half only.  The story deteriorates into w depiction of what I would consider abusive treatment along with emotional cruelty both allowed by the mother ""for his own good"" as well as perpetrated by her,. Yes, the friendship between the child and the creature was supposed to have been his salvation from all that, but not the way it played out that he never even caught another glimpse again.  There were a few scenes that had no reason to be, such as the dog getting eaten, and in general too much ""military""  Overall the movie left me feeling angry, especially to see that the cycle of abandonment and abuse was primed to be told again about another child.  I regret the two hours I wasted watching it and I would not show this movie to young children.  I don't consider this ""family fare""  Save yourself the trouble of watching",1525219200,,876,4.547770700636943

8246085,2,B0012IWO0I,"This movie may be fine if you haven't read the book, but having just read the book as a family, we were quite disappointed. The story line changed drastically - additional plot lines, action and violence were unnecessarily added in. The book was absolutely fine as written, but the producers of this overly changed a good family book, to a darker movie (still a ""family"" movie, if you don't mind cruel characters, bombings, war, etc... all things my younger children - ages 8 and 6 - didn't need to be exposed to.) On the ""plus"" side... if I truly stretch, it led to a nice 5 minute conversation after about how book can be changed and altered when turned into movies, and how those changes aren't always good changes, or appropriate. I don't recommend watching this movie if you read and enjoyed the book.",1512172800,,806,4.604166666666667
