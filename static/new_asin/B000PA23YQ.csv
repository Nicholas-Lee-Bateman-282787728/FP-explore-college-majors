8189944,5,B000PA23YQ,"First A warning about this DVD - If you want both the Mighty Boosh live shows (this and Future Sailors live) just get the Future Sailors Live Deluxe version. I made the mistake of buying both. That isn't a big deal in itself but trying to find someone else I know who had a region free DVD player is a bit of a problem. No complaints it makes the import section of my DVD display look fuller ;)

Alright so this is the live show from 2006. If you want a complete list of what is in the show you'll need to check out the UK amazon page. There's plenty of reviews and details of the show located there. This being PAL or Region 2 this will not work in US DVD players. There's two ways around this you can download a free piece of software and watch it through your PC or buy a region free dvd player. I'd strongly suggest just downloading the free software and save the money on a new player.

Also there is a lot of strong language on this dvd, so just be for warned. many of the jokes are simply not for children.",1324771200,,1013,4.06

8189946,5,B000PA23YQ,"Rather than providing anything new, I'll just comment on the 2 previous reviews: I agree with the all the points made about the show being loose and unruly. This is not a slick release, and suffers the translation from stage to DVD. That said, I loved it. I loved that they were screwing around, with each other, the script, and the audience. It's like everyting Boosh, the first viewing is never the best viewing. That's why we buy this stuff. We'll ignore the stupid parts (there are always a few), and focus on the genius. This proformance isn't bad, it's just a bit laissez-faire. ...still gets 5-stars from me, on account of, I watch it a lot.",1259280000,,648,4.547008547008547
8189947,2,B000PA23YQ,"I am a big fan of the show and I didn't like this that much.  Some of the skits are good, but it is very slow.  No new songs.  I felt embarassed for them.  It was painful to watch.  It's like they were looking for a way to write-off a trip that they hadn't prepared material for.  Hopefully this review will lower your expectations so that you can enjoy it more.",1240876800,,362,4.028169014084507
8189948,5,B000PA23YQ,"This is the funniest live show you will ever see in your life.

I love the Mighty Boosh, you don't have to have seen the T.V series but it wouls make it less weird and more funny! keep an open mind and if you have kids maybe you should watch it first then decide if you want them to watch this! (especially the part with the hitcher near the end)

Hellarios I couldn't stop laughing... I have shown all my friends.

I can't stress enough how much you need this DVD!!!!",1202428800,4,468,4.1208791208791204
