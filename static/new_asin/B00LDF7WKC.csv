6480592,5,B00LDF7WKC,"I watched this with my kids and they really enjoyed it. My daughter was shy at first thinking it was too hard but by the 2nd time she was really into it and having loads of fun, not even thinking she was actually ""practicing"" soccer. My oldest, who played in high school, said he wishes he would have had this back then and he probably could have gotten that scholarship! It is fun for the kids, so they are having fun while learning real skills for the pitch. When we start our girls team back up in the spring, the whole team is gonna watch this video. SO excited to share this awesome training tool with other soccer players.",1416355200,5,628,4.285714285714286
6480593,5,B00LDF7WKC,This DVD is a really fun way to develop better touches on the ball and quick decision making in tight places and great stamina. I love it because it can be used for all ages and they really explain everything step by step.  Will be using this program a lot for futsal! Would recommend this to anyone who is looking to improve their skills.,1415923200,6,339,4.296875
6480594,5,B00LDF7WKC,"My 9yr old daughter plays on a select team and trains with an individual twice per week. I received the video thinking it may just be a ""fun"" addition to her training. I was more than impressed with the level of skill being demonstrated, and although it was in a ""fun"" format, my daughter went thru the video once, and then asked to go thru the video again. Not thinking too much about it, she trained the next day with her trainer and he asked what she had been doing differently at home as her ball control was much improved from 4 days earlier...just from her going thru the video twice!
If you have kids that love the game, and could use improvement on their technical skills this video is fantastic!",1415923200,10,704,4.3816793893129775
6480595,2,B00LDF7WKC,"I love the premise of turning soccer training into fun dances for kids to learn with the ball, however this video leaves a lot to be desired. The production work is pretty poor. The instructor is monotone and kind of boring to watch and listen to and the ""dances"" are too easy and boring and are really just normal basic ball handling drills set to music. Again it's a great idea with pretty poor execution.",1490832000,,407,4.44
6480596,5,B00LDF7WKC,They loved it,1489708800,,13,3.6666666666666665
6480597,3,B00LDF7WKC,You really need to grind the tutorials or else you will be lost.  What I don't like is that the person doing the drills is not always in full screen...  you cannot see his feet!,1489536000,2,177,4.0285714285714285
6480598,5,B00LDF7WKC,"My kids absolutely LOVE this video!  They rush home to do it after school, even our nonsoccer player enjoys it.",1489190400,,111,4.55
6480599,2,B00LDF7WKC,Thought it would be more music based. Does not reflect actual names of skills or done with precision.,1485388800,,101,4.666666666666667
6480600,5,B00LDF7WKC,Ordered it to improve our girls rec team. First thing I noticed is the physical workout. We started with just learning easy moves with ball. It got their heart rate up. During our 3 vs 3 I could see results. Start slow and finish like a champion,1485043200,,245,4.23404255319149
6480601,5,B00LDF7WKC,I have 8 and 12 year old girls.  Both like the video and said it makes practicing foot skills a lot more fun!  Anything to improve touches on the ball is good.,1485043200,,159,3.9375
6480602,5,B00LDF7WKC,My son loved it.,1484006400,,16,3.25
6480603,1,B00LDF7WKC,"Don't bother buying this video, I assure you it's not worth 1.00, 2 guys that look clue less and have the personality of a tree!",1483228800,,128,4.16
6480604,5,B00LDF7WKC,"My 9, 7, and 4 year old love the video. Fun, challenging, and interactive. Makes winter soccer season fun!  My 9 year old has seen a great improvement on her touches and ball skills. A good confidence booster too.",1482537600,,213,4.461538461538462
6480605,4,B00LDF7WKC,"It's a good dvd. But in its own way kind of fun. I will say the printed insert and the DVD menu differ in the starting order to perform everything. This will not make your kid a Beckham soccer star, but it's a fun way to incorporate some skills into drills and have some fun.",1481500800,,275,4.0181818181818185
6480606,1,B00LDF7WKC,"Really disappointed. I ran across this product through Facebook, and was so excited to order it for my boys. Their Facebook advertisement shows kids doing the workouts, which I thought would be fun and motivating, so I bought both programs through Vimeo to have right on the TV or Tablet. That is not at all what we got. The videos are of two out of breath men in what looks like a warehouse setting. There's nothing fun or motivating about this program! The concept is great, but the execution was horrible. For $29.99, I would have expected something better. This is a huge disappointment.",1481241600,,591,4.6923076923076925
6480607,5,B00LDF7WKC,"I've been a soccer coach for many years and trying to get the youngsters to practice footwork has always been a challenge. So, I used my 11 year old daughter as the test subject as she hates practicing just footwork. She loves to sing and dance and I thought this would be good for her. I popped in the DVD and started by just letting the music play. Of course, she comes in the room to check it out. I explained it as ""soccer basics set to music"". She watched for a minute and headed to get a ball. She followed the natural course of the program (this is key) and was amazed at how hard and fun it was! Then, my 8 year old son came in and said... I can do that! They are both doing it daily and having fun with it. I can't wait to get them back on the field this spring!
Now, to those 1-star reviews that are worried about how the cover looks or how out of breath the performers are:
1. You are not going to see a video of someone in a tux doing dance moves with a soccer ball. You will see basic soccer footwork moves and tricks set to music in a way that is easy to remember.
2. The performers are out of breath from time to time because they are exercising hard and have to talk to explain what is going on while they do the moves. Parents... get off the couch and do this with your kids. You'll see what I mean!",1479945600,8,1316,3.9511278195488724
6480608,4,B00LDF7WKC,Great tool for a novice soccer player,1479772800,,37,4.428571428571429
6480609,5,B00LDF7WKC,My son absolutely loves this foot skills DVD.  He  has been using this video to help improve his skills for 2 years and still loves doing it. One of the best Christmas gifts we got him by far. I recommend this video to his teammates parents whenever I get a chance. Great for rainy days to keep your kids moving. It truly is a workout that will help them develop. I am always proud when I see him use a move on the field that he has learned from the video. We wish you would come out with a follow-up video!!,1473638400,,508,4.01980198019802
6480610,5,B00LDF7WKC,"We purchased this for our 10 yr old daughter who plays club soccer.  Her footwork improved at team practice and games immediately after going through the complete program one time.  This is the only thing she will do for training on her own, she will use it in our basement and go through 1 or 2 of the jam sessions at a time.  The first time she tried it she thought it was hard and she couldn't do it, she went through the practice sessions a couple of times and her confidence grew and now she enjoys it. She uses many of the moves in games without even thinking about what she is doing. My 5 year old will join in with her sometimes and even though he may not be able to do all the moves his footwork has improved also.",1472515200,3,723,4.077464788732394
6480611,1,B00LDF7WKC,"Sounded like a great idea, but the product - this should have just been a clip on YouTube. It's two guys, in a poorly made video, who are out of breath a minute in to the workout. I applaud your effort, but this amazingly disappointing.",1465257600,,236,4.266666666666667
6480612,4,B00LDF7WKC,"Well, this is a neat video for youngsters trying to develop better skills. The picture on the front cover certainly doesn't go with anything I've seen on the video. It is just two guys in tshirts and shorts. They would have got 5 stars with a little more energy and complex sessions later on the video. Maybe they'll come out with a sequel.",1464912000,,340,4.412698412698413
6480613,5,B00LDF7WKC,my 8 year old is enjoying learning the moves.,1463961600,,45,4.111111111111111
6480614,5,B00LDF7WKC,My son likes to do the video. He seems to be making improvements and his confidence seems to be improving also.,1462752000,,111,4.333333333333333
6480615,5,B00LDF7WKC,my seven year old loves it,1462406400,,26,3.5
6480616,4,B00LDF7WKC,Great to do a workout but moves are a bit hard. Good thing is you can pause and do over as many times. Recommend.,1461715200,,113,3.75
6480617,1,B00LDF7WKC,Not worth buying.,1461196800,,17,5.0
6480618,5,B00LDF7WKC,Great video,1460678400,,11,5.0
6480619,4,B00LDF7WKC,"My girls team done this in the off season. Some moves were a little hard for some, but for the most part they got the moves fairly quickly",1456358400,,138,3.9642857142857144
6480620,5,B00LDF7WKC,My sons ball handling skills have improved greatly.  It's nice seeing him put the moves to use on the field.  Great product at a great price.,1454630400,,141,4.384615384615385
6480621,5,B00LDF7WKC,Makes ball work fun and builds rhythm for the beautiful game. This is good for all skill levels. As a coach I have recommended to my team and am working it into our training sessions. Parents - this is a good workout for you as well to do with your players. My heart rate is up by the time we are finished with a session. Can't wait for volume II and and a downloadable /streamable version. Audio MP3 files available once you have the moves down from watching the video.,1453939200,2,470,4.233333333333333
6480622,5,B00LDF7WKC,"A fantastic way to interact with kids and improve their skills at the same time. My 9 year old has been using this DVD for past month and his skill level has improved 100%. The best part about the DVD is it it explains each and every move, formation and how to use each technique.",1453680000,,280,4.109090909090909
6480623,3,B00LDF7WKC,My 8 year old was already experienced with many of the activities in the DVD. So it was a redundant purchase for us. That is the only reason I gave it three stars. Would be a great purchase for the player just starting out.,1453420800,,223,4.090909090909091
6480624,5,B00LDF7WKC,"I've play soccer since I have memory.
I'm 28 and never been very good w/techniques
After few sessions I have better control of the .  Can wait to master every move.",1451952000,,164,4.290322580645161
6480625,5,B00LDF7WKC,I like the skills taught in the video. Some are more difficult than others so there is some variation in the training. My son (10 yr. old) will pop it in and do some of the drills from time to time. I will be circulating the did through my team this fall to give them something new to try and see what they think.,1438387200,4,313,3.90625
6480626,5,B00LDF7WKC,Awesome workout for kids and adults.  My 11 yr old competitive team boy does it 4-5 times per week.  His foot skills have improved tremendously.,1437523200,,144,4.72
6480627,5,B00LDF7WKC,"A practical aerobic workout, learning and using soccer skills. The ""Defensive"" section has a basic flaw in it because the instructor consistently calls his left foot his Right and his right foot his Left. Since he is consistent it doesn't really matter but I thought that he should have done a re-take of this section since it must be embarrassing for him and it is a little confusing for students seeing it for the first time.",1435449600,,427,4.631578947368421
6480628,5,B00LDF7WKC,My boys love it,1434499200,,15,3.0
6480629,5,B00LDF7WKC,Great DVD! Plenty of things to learn for newbies and intermediate users. I have an 8 year old boy and 12 year old girl who enjoy this. Highly recommended!!,1433808000,,155,4.379310344827586
6480630,5,B00LDF7WKC,Recieved item very fast and kids absolutely love it is so helpful thx.,1430092800,,70,4.461538461538462
6480631,5,B00LDF7WKC,My kid loves it! He is getting better using both feet everyday! Great for spring in the south when practice and academy are getting cancelled due to rain and field conditions.,1428796800,2,175,4.67741935483871
6480632,4,B00LDF7WKC,This is a fantastic video for learning the fundamentals of soccer. At any level the fundamentals need to be rehearesed  and this is an excellent way to keep up the fundamentals throughout your soccer career.,1423353600,2,207,4.914285714285715
6480633,5,B00LDF7WKC,"Exercises that are shown in the video, Soccer Jam Skills Program, are similar to what my coach taught me, but merged into one program. I can already see the difference in my ball handling! I did not think it would help me at first, but the exercises are very good.  I recommend it to all my friends, because it works for all positions. Some exercises are difficult at the beginning, but anyone can learn. I received this free DVD from the producer in exchange for an honest review.",1420588800,4,481,4.465909090909091
6480634,5,B00LDF7WKC,I have played soccer since I was 6 years old. I have played for 35 years and still do. Skill work with the ball at your feet is the best way to become a better player. This video is the best one I have seen at giving players the opportunity at learning these skills. The best part is that is makes it fun while being repetitive. Repetition is key to foot skill with the ball. I have gone to many camps to learn these foot skills and none compare to the skills taught with this video. I would recommend this for any young or old soccer players looking to improve their skills and being able to have fun doing it.,1416873600,7,611,4.1
8665353,5,B00LDF7WKC,"I love it so far. I am a coach of 10 year olds who need some work in their fundamentals. I also never learned much footwork as I was growing up. I have been working on this, so I don't look like a complete fool when I do it with my team this spring. I feel more confident already, and I've only semi-mastered 2 sessions (Heartspells and British Bulldog).",1519257600,,354,4.144927536231884
8665354,3,B00LDF7WKC,"Good program.  But, didn't keep my child's interest for long.  Maybe will try again next season.  Fast shipping.",1518566400,,112,5.111111111111111
8665355,5,B00LDF7WKC,"The DVD came on time and is exactly what we expected it to be. Soccer Jam gives my two boys who are both soccer players some really good practice with foot touches on the ball. They like it, and I like that they can practice it in the house, especially as the days are getting colder outside right now. My husband is a soccer coach and he approves. I have even seen him practicing it with my boys a couple of times.",1510099200,,415,4.073170731707317
8665356,5,B00LDF7WKC,have only done 1 session with my U10 soccer team and they are going around everyone now at the U11 group.,1507075200,,105,4.0476190476190474
8665357,4,B00LDF7WKC,"A little too slow, my kids sometimes lost interest.  I have to do it with them so they'll stay engaged.  If you use it, the toughest part is getting through the intro where they walk you through the steps, then it becomes more fun after you are able to keep up.  Music could be more upbeat, lost 1 star there.",1503273600,,309,4.116666666666666
8665358,5,B00LDF7WKC,I bought this for my 8 year old daughter to get her daily touches in.  It's great for kids as they do a great job explaining all of the different moves.  I will be purchasing this form our entire u10 soccer team.,1503014400,,212,4.023809523809524
8665359,5,B00LDF7WKC,"Excellent.  Me and my daughter used this quite a bit to help with skills during bad weather days. I also used this with my team. It is amazing how many ball touches you get during one session. To do it right takes commitment, but it is worth it.",1499990400,,245,4.104166666666667
8665360,5,B00LDF7WKC,Excellent program,1493337600,,17,8.0
