2522312,5,B000ELL0LI,"While I wish it was the Encore tour that would've been released this works just as well. Anastacia is a powerful performer with an even more powerful voice. This DVD showcases her 2004/2005 Live at Last Tour, the first full fledged tour of her musical career. High points of the show have to be Freak of Nature, You'll Never Be Alone, Heavy on My Heart, Who's Gonna Stop the Rain, Left Outside Alone and I Do. Its a fabulous DVD and I love watching it over and over again.

The DVD comes with a second disc with bonus features including videos for Seasons Change, Rearview, Time and I Do. Also included is a 1 hour documentary showcasing Anastacia during the Encore leg of the tour, included in the documentary are 3 others songs (Rearview, The Saddest Part and One Day in Your Life. From the Encore leg)

Just a word of advice to anyone planning on buying this DVD, while totally  worth it, the DVD is in PAL format meaning it will not play on any North American TV. Though it will for certain play on your computer if you have a DVD player in it, which most computer do.",1187481600,,1072,4.35
2522313,4,B000ELL0LI,"Let's get something clear here.  Amazon hasn't made the change to indicate that this is a PAL DVD set, and not an NTSC DVD set, & must have a DVD player capable of playing PAL DVD's.  Just so the buyers are aware.  Onto the actual review.  Anastacia finally released a Live concert DVD of her best songs.  I personally believe she sounds better in the concert than on the albums.  The video starts with the opening of the concert, and playing Seasons Change.  Then going into Why'd You Lie to me, and altered the song a bit from the album, but it's a great version.  Sick & Tired sounds almost like the album.  Like the albums, she goes from upbeat to balad, & back.  She gets funky with Not That Kind, then going into Funky Breakdown, where for a moment, Chic's Le Freak was playing while the dancers did their numbers, waiting for Anastacia to change into her next outfit.  Freak of Nature continues the funk.  I should mention Not that Kind & Freak of Nature, she wore her trademark glasses.  Then there was a Ballet Interlude, then she decided to let the backup singers sing most of Black Roses, which I thought was excellent.  Each backup singer had a voice of their own, and made it sound romantic.  I however was disappointed with You'll Never Be Alone, since the song was cut that short.  It sounded like it was only a minute.  She mainly talked about the song.  Heavy on my Heart sounds rather emotional, and even more so in the live footage over the album version.  Welcome to My Truth is nothing special.  Underground Army was sung in the concert, which for some reason wasn't made for the Anastacia album.  Good song.  Starting with Who's Gonna Stop The Rain, it goes acoustic, and she's in the center of the audience, then goies directly into Overdue Goodbye.  Then back to the actual stage, choreographers perform to Time, which is playing in the background, while she again changes into a new outfit.  She sounds like she strains her vocals a bit singing Left Outside Alone, and she sings the version that is on the album, and not the radio version.  I Do sounds much like the album.

Paid My Dues & I'm Outta Love were disappointing, since she cut both songs short.  I would have enjoyed the funky version of I'm Outta Love, if the song wasn't shortened a lot.  But overall it's a great concert, and she is being herself.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because first of all, an NTSC version for North America wasn't made, and Sony has no intention of releasing this DVD to North America.  The second reason is the case is poorly designed.  In order to get to the first DVD, you must remove the second DVD first, and both of them are tricky to remove.  The case should have been made to where each DVD was each side, and not all on the right side of the inside of the case.  The second DVD is all bonus material, including the making of the Live at Last DVD, alternate videos, and current music videos.",1178668800,,2938,4.411545623836127
2522314,4,B000ELL0LI,"Some purchasers have complained about an inability to play this item--with good reason.  The DVD I received is not NTSC as listed on Amazon, but a European PAL DVD NOT compatible with standard American DVD players.  I was able to watch it on my Mac computer DVD player and a No Regions DVD player I own, but my USA DVD player will NOT play it.  Amazon should revised their description of this item to warn purchasers that MOST will not be able to watch it if they live in the USA.

That said, I enjoy Anastacia.  She has a powerful, soulful voice, a dynamic and compelling stage presence and a funky, fun-loving band.  Not to mention she's quite pulchritudinous.  I still can't understand why she hasn't been embraced by her home country.  If she was a big hit in the US, maybe there'd be an NTSC DVD that everyone in this country could enjoy.",1165104000,8,843,4.428571428571429
2522315,5,B000ELL0LI,"i love anastacia. LOVE HER. but when bought the DVD, it was not compatible with the three DVD players in our apartment. so i returned it. i found another seller, who assured me it would work. the second DVD did not work either. so sad...but i have hope. i'll keep searching until i have this frickin' DVD. (I'll give it 5 stars since i'm sure it's awesome, though my buying experience is a 1 star...)",1158710400,2,400,4.346666666666667

2522317,1,B000ELL0LI,"I ordered this item because I am a huge Anastacia fan. However, I did not know about the region codes on DVD's therefore when I got the DVD's they would not play in any of my DVD players.  If you decide to order this item make sure it is compatible with U.S. dvd players.  I would not want anyone to be disappointed like I was.....Buyer Beware!!!!!!",1147478400,7,349,4.2727272727272725
2522318,5,B000ELL0LI,"The concert was amazing! She definitely rocked the stage! All the performances were awsome and the best of all: they're all live! - at last. I went to see her when she came to Finland and I loved the show. This DVD is a must have for all Ana fans out there!

The second disc has so many extras that it could've been released seperately. It includes the screen videos from the tour: Seasons Change, Rearview, Time, Underground Army and I Do. And the documentary is also amazing. You'll be able to follow her during the Live At Last Tour and Encore Tour. It includes some never-before-seen performances that she only did on her Encore Tour, such as the performance of ""Rearview"" (full performance), ""One Day In Your Life"" (full) and a performance of another song which was new to me, full aswell.

That's not all, the second disc also contains the music videos for Everything Burns, Pieces Of A Dream, I Belong To You, Left Outside Alone (unreleased US version).",1145059200,11,960,4.608187134502924

As far as Ana is concerned, she is simply one of the finest vocalists today. It is a shame that she gets no traction in the US.",1356048000,,383,4.052631578947368

8111013,5,B000ELL0LI,"After reading other reviews I purchased anyhow.  It works, it's a great concert filmed in Germany, and she is without a doubt one of the best singer in the world!  My wife and kids even love her music now!",1231286400,,205,4.230769230769231
8111014,3,B000ELL0LI,"I went back and read the reviews after I could not play this DVD in my player.  The description says ""All Regions"" so I am not happy about the error.  I can play it on my MAC so I did see it and it was phenomenal... just wish they would have listed the DVD in the proper region for Europe only players!!",1226793600,,303,3.870967741935484
8111015,5,B000ELL0LI,"I didn't see the ""PAL"" word when i bought this item. I guess it's a great DVD.",1217548800,,78,3.6470588235294117
8111016,3,B000ELL0LI,"I think everyone has said what there is to say about this awesome show. Anastacia rocks. The live versions of songs are barely recognisable - and that is GOOD! I am lucky in that I am in a PAL coutry, so compatibility isn't an issue. (Though I find it strange that the US doesn't sell gear that is compatible with PAL countries, as all the TVs and layers in PAL countries will play NTSC as well.

My beef is that is it only Dolby Stereo (although it is a good mix). Why have such a great video production and not make the sound 5.1, both Dolby and DTS?",1203552000,,552,4.111111111111111
8111017,1,B000ELL0LI,"I love Anastacia and was really looking forward to seeing this live concert. Sadly, it will not play in players not set up for PAL, which are most of the DVD players in the US. Other reviews of this product have said the same thing and Amazon continues to sell it in the US. On Anastacia's website, it even says this DVD is NOT available in North America. Nowhere on Amazon's website does it indicate that this DVD only comes in PAL, not NTSC. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it to Amazon. Wake up folks!",1202428800,3,521,4.22
8111018,4,B000ELL0LI,"Anastacia's long awaited DVD was finally released and surpassed my expectations! It is unimaginable how this talented singer-songwriter has not gained popularity in the U.S. yet is considered to be the biggest female artist in the world and is originally from New York! Both her stage voice and presence are demanding and her dedication to and appreciation of her fans, unwavering. The only drawback to this DVD is that it is formatted in Region 2, common in Europe. Most of the newer DVD players here can adapt to it, however, mine is a few years old and will not play the disc. I had to watch it on my laptop. Other than that, this is definitely worth owning!!!",1200873600,,663,4.627118644067797
