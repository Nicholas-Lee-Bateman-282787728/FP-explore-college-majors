7908260,3,B00000F95A,"While the prior scathing review for this video accurately states that it has nothing to do with ""Reading the Wind"", that review seriously under values the content. Not everyone is an expert sailor like that reviewer. It's definitely not for experienced sailers, but is interesting and informative for the intended audience.

The tape does have good, clearly presented, introductory material for anyone just starting to sail. Like other videos in this series, it is very basic, exactly what my wife needed after trying the ""hands on"" approach for a while. Robbie clearly explains terms and functions of basic sail handling processes and equipment. Taken for what it is, I'd recommend it to anyone just starting out, particularly if their sailing partners are ""old salts"" and take everything for granted.",1153180800,,802,5.217054263565892
7908261,1,B00000F95A,"This tape has nothing whatsoever to do with the skills involved with reading the wind. Shifts, direction, duration, puffs, lulls, etc., aren't even discussed. It deals only with how to run a genoa -- way too elementary and mindlessly obvious to anyone who's ever been near a sailboat. It's  hardly worth paying the money to get tips like, ""...use a  big headsail in light air and a little one in heavy air...""
It's a  sad commentary on the retirment of America's Cup skippers to see Robbie  Doyle waste his time making garbage like this. You can get better  instruction on reading the wind by watching Murphy Brown re-runs than you  can by watching this video.",959904000,16,660,4.695652173913044
