7967300,4,B00006CXG3,"I couldn't sit through the 3 other movies for being so dull. Dragon On Fire is the choice because it contains dialogue from the Wu Tang Clan's Gza's 1st solo record ""Liquid Swords"". If you ever wanted to see who it was ""during the height of their fame & glory, turned on each other, each struggling in vain for Ultimate supremacy"" then get this dvd!!! The movie has some strange characters but it's not terrible at all. It's still dubbed by the old school voice actors, not some annoying re-dub done in the past 10 years as some of you may seen when they ruin the film's original quality by trying to do a ""remaster"". More like a ""re-Amateur"".

Special Note: there is another ""Dragon on Fire"" movie, a completely different film. That is not the one with GZA samples. This is.",1377561600,,775,4.457746478873239
7967301,3,B00006CXG3,"Champ vs Champ...Quality of film to dvd transfer very good.  Shots are not tight, audio okay.  The quality of this film is better than the other I reviewed from a single dvd.  Rage of the Dragon...Quality of film to dvd transfer is very poor.  Print has color shifts and dark drop outs in scenes, there is cuts in the action and the audio is weak.  A very poor print was used in making this dvd.  Dragon on Fire...Quality of film to dvd transfer is bad.  Color shifts of red and washed out scenes exist.  Shots to tight and ruin some of the action shots.  Also, this film is not Dragon on Fire, but a different Dragon Lee film.  Golden Dragon/Silver Snake...Quality of film to dvd transfrer is poor.  Film goes into red and blue, shots very tight and the dvd technician's voice is heard on the audio tract.  Come on boys, get with it.

7967304,4,B00006CXG3,I had seen the other Bruce Lee impersonators before and never liked there movies but I got this cause it was cheep and thought I would try it.  Champ against Champ is a very good movie. It is a little cheesy but just the right amount of cheesiness to be funny and not annoying.  If all the movies where as good as it I would give it 5 stars.  The other 3 movies are good too but just not as good as Champ against Champ.  Dragon Lee is by far the best Bruce Lee impersonator ever.,1085184000,2,479,3.9583333333333335
