539339,5,630303828X,I just watched this movie on the Romance Channel and immediately came to amazon.com to buy 2 copies. One for me and one for my sister who just loves this kind of thing. I loved it!,946425600,7,180,4.027777777777778
539340,5,630303828X,"OK a corny, implausible story but beautifully acted and directed. Even the sound effects of the London Blitz are amazingly accurate -- and I was there. Sharon Stone was brilliant in this much underpraised romance. They  were all very good.",940032000,,239,4.975
539427,5,630303828X,This was a very good movie. I have watched it repeated times. It has old-fashioned values and supports the idea of undying love. I  really enjoyed it.,1496707200,,150,4.555555555555555

539434,2,630303828X,"i have never cared for Sharon Stone's acting ability and this film didn't persuade me otherwise.  The 'SUDS""were just too thick on the ground to give this movie more than two stars.  Don't waste your time unless you enjoy Harlequins.",1475107200,,233,4.8

539498,5,630303828X,"The first part of it needed some serious improvement;  it could have been much better,  but when it finally began rolling along, it immediately got more interesting,  and by the end,  I'd decided it's now one of my favorite films.  I've watched it more than once, and will again later.  I don't usually like flashbacks,  but this time that's what saved the movie.  The WWII scenes were excellent,  and I loved the song that ran throughout.",1466812800,3,439,4.671052631578948

539503,5,630303828X,"I have LOVED  this movie since it first came out!! One of Sharon Stones finest performances before she got ""TRASHY"", and sold out to Hollywood. You see her wholesomeness, and soft side. It's an led movie, but to me with all its twists and turns made it  a Classic",1462060800,,263,4.346938775510204
539504,3,630303828X,It was refreshing to see another side of Sharon Stone that must have existed before she gave herself over to her hedonistic batch of films. She was apparently more innocent at one time. I blame Hollywood. I wonder what she has to say about these issues.,1459900800,,253,4.521739130434782

539579,4,630303828X,"This was a great movie to watch on a cold, rainy  day.  The acting was a bit over the top but we are talking about a romance movie with an 80s production value.  It was interesting to watch a young Sharon Stone playing the part of a Kentucky ingenue on a mission to deliver a letter to an English lord as part of a promise to her deceased mother.

I loved the back and forth in history and to be honest, I found the WW II part of the story line more compelling than the present setting.  There is a secret and a twist at the end that gave this story its HEA.  For romantics at heart, it is a good find.",1447718400,,602,3.8934426229508197

539697,4,630303828X,I first saw this movie on cable YEARS ago. Sharon Stone wasn't even famous then. I fell completely in love with this film.

539699,4,630303828X,A good movie for what it is: sappy romance story. The historical flashbacks add another element to it which I thought helped make it a better story.,1397692800,,148,4.518518518518518
539700,5,630303828X,Old favorite. Saw it many years ago and liked it.  Thought it was not available any more.  Pleasantly surprised when I found it.,1395014400,,128,4.521739130434782
539701,4,630303828X,"The movie was good overall, a bit predictable but still OK. The male leader was really good, I liked his acting a lot. The rest of the Brittish actors were very good too. Unfortunately Sharon did not woo me this time. She was very beautiful tho. :)",1394150400,,248,4.297872340425532
539702,4,630303828X,"Really a five star rating, because it kept me wondering all the time. I have recommended the movie to several people. I bought it on kindle because the first time saw it, I recorded it from the tv. Having commercials  in it. I wanted non  interrupt. It is really a good mistery. I like the characters",1388793600,,300,4.339285714285714

539704,5,630303828X,I enjoyed this movie and it is the first movie I remember Sharon Stone playing in. An unexpected twist to an expected ending.,1387843200,,125,4.478260869565218
539737,5,630303828X,Even though older a very romantic story in England - Fairy tale. A must hav-it. Once seen it will keep its magic and you want to see it again and again and again... Lovely!,1384214400,,172,4.088235294117647
539738,5,630303828X,"This was a made-for-tv movie way back; it was Sharon Stone's first role. The story itself is very unique and the movie is done with superb acting, direction, and a fabulous screenplay. I had wanted this movie for years, and finally found it on Amazon. I am so thrilled to have it. I'm a movie buff, but this rates in my Top Ten. The service I got with Amazon was amazing, and I am having my grown children watch this movie. Two of them have already said they're going to order it.  It's a one-of-a-kind and it is truly an amazing experience to see it. Thanks to Amazon, I now have it. I'll probably watch it about six times a year!",1377993600,2,631,4.214876033057851
539739,3,630303828X,I had seen this years ago and thought I'd check it out again. It was OK. Very dated (as to be expected) but interesting in it's own way.,1377734400,,136,3.892857142857143

539741,5,630303828X,this was a very interesting movie. U just know that something doesn't seem right from the very beginning. This is one of them that will keep u guessing clear through the movie. Was really worth the watch. Sharon Stone played an awesome part.,1367884800,,241,4.627906976744186

539808,4,630303828X,"This was a really nice romance.  The acting was sometimes stilted, but overall it was really an enjoyable movie complete with the classic romance elements and characters.  I wish they made more romance movies.",1355961600,,209,5.117647058823529

539812,5,630303828X,"I found this relatively unknown movie a few years ago. I didn't even know who Sharon Stone was. I guess she had not ""made it"" yet. This is a great movie for my two cents. It is pure suspense about two generations of romance.",1353715200,,224,4.113636363636363

539860,3,630303828X,I love this movie.  I watched it years ago.  The video quality is not good at all.  It reminded me of watching an old VHS tape.  Changing the tv mode to theater improved the video quality enough to make it watchable...but barely.,1316736000,,229,4.380952380952381

539862,5,630303828X,"A young and beautiful Sharon Stone delivers a powerful performance in this delightful romance set in modern-day England with flashbacks to the devastated London of World War 2.  Christopher Cazenove, as always, is suave and debonair and totally exciting.  There is also a background song, ""Safe In My Arms Again,"" which adds to the movie.  I loved it.",1255564800,,351,5.017241379310345

539864,1,630303828X,"I had bought this movie in a store a while back and it is nothing against Sharon Stone because I love her acting but this movie was really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone. If there was a less then ""B-Rated"" on movies this one would be at the top of the list. If you are considering buying it please think twice before you do because it is a real waste of money spent.

539866,5,630303828X,"I was so pleased when I learned that Amazon carried this DVD, because it is a personal favorite love story for me.  I initially watched this on a women's channel several years ago, and couldn't get it out of my head, but at the time, it wasn't available anywhere, in any form.  If you are truly a romantic at heart, then I highly recommend this beautiful story of the past and present.  The characters are believable, and the story is well written.  I never watch it without shedding tears, but they are good tears.",1208995200,,515,4.446808510638298

I would have given it 5 stars because of the story and acting.  I also suggest this movie.  But only if you don't mind VHS picture quality.  One could only hope that one day the manufacture will produce another version in widescreen from a digital master.,1202688000,,373,4.36231884057971

539928,1,630303828X,"I will preface this by telling you I am not a Sharon Stone fan. However her role in Tears In the Rain, made in 1988 four years before she starred in Basic Instinct, definitely impressed me with her acting abilities. Her younger, softer, almost girl-next-door wholesomeness enchants the viewer from the beginning. Casey Cantrell (Sharon Stone) has been left instructions after her mother's death to hand deliver a letter to Lord Richard Bredon (the late Shakespearean actor Paul Daneman) in the United Kingdom. Upon her arrival a twist of fate throws Casey into the arms of Lord Bredon's son Michael (Christopher Cazenove).
  While the story itself is outstanding and the acting is great, this particular version is absolutely terrible. The DVD is transfer poorly done, the color is inferior at best, the sound quality is deplorable, the picture is grainy and fuzzy. Legacy Entertainment should be ashamed to have their name on it. Take my advice and buy the 2006 version re-released by Trinity Entertainment (far better quality).
  Take a dashing hero, a beautiful heroine, and an evil influence (in the form of Lady Emily played quite well by Anna Massey) wrap them in mystery and intrigue and what do you have... the makings of a great romantic fairytale. As the story unfolds you realize that there are actually two love stories here, one in the past and the one in the present. We are treated to a veritable feast of romance, drama, and suspense. As you ride along on this rollercoaster ride of emotions you are swept along by the love Casey and Michael share. I was enthralled in this tale of great and undying love. I found that it took my breath away and kept me guessing at every turn, right up to the surprise ending.
  Sharon Stone and this predominately British cast deliver the kind of romantic storyline that women crave- and they do it quite well. And men could take a few lessons from the ever romantic Michael.
  No special effects or special features here, just a great story that is well done. Based on the novel written by Pamela Wallace and adapted by Freda Kelsall and directed by Don Sharp. Hey all you romantics out there, this is one movie you must see!",1201651200,,2177,4.7407407407407405

  The movie was filmed in mono but the picture quality is good and the sound quality is okay, unlike the earlier DVD version (which was terrible). No special effects or special features here, just a great story that is well done. Based on the novel written by Pamela Wallace and adapted by Freda Kelsall and directed by Don Sharp. Hey all you romantics out there, this is one movie you must see!",1201651200,20,1915,4.650887573964497
539930,5,630303828X,"This was an excellent movie.  I would have to agree that this could quite possible be the best work we've seen from Sharon Stone (and she ""is"" a very good actress).

I quess the reason I am not in a uproar over the quality of the movie is the fact that I saw it on display at Wal-Mart for $3.44 and couldn't resist.  Since I had never even heard of the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  Although I would have to say, that in this day and age...with all the technology available, the studio should have put up a bit more effort to digitally remaster this film.  Hell, had they done that, they would have been able to charge more, without accumulating disgruntled customers.

Would suggest others try to catch this film on television, or get it on VHS.",1159747200,,752,4.374100719424461

There was a chemistry between Cazenove and Stone, and the ending was a surprise and it is a tear jerker.  Love horses, but Sharon can't ride well ..then.  Don't know if she has improved. But then I am a professional with 3 Gold USDF MEDALS. May not be fair.  GET THE VHS AND BE HAPPY..the DVD also cuts some of it out.",1148688000,15,394,4.131578947368421
539934,5,630303828X,"This is one of the most effective love stories you'll ever see.  It tells a parallel story of two loves, one in the present and one in the past (several years before ""Possession"").  The gradual revelation of the past love story is handled more deftly in the movie than in the book.  However, the two scenes early in the movie in which Michael's behavior borders on violence are not by the book: in the book he is aggressive but far from violent.  Still, the quality and effectiveness of this movie earn it a five-star rating.

The surprise ending is completely and well prepared for, so there are no grounds for objecting to it.  In fact, it would be incredible if what is revealed were not so, given what has happened.

Sharon Stone gives the performance of her career in this movie, three years before she became a femme fatale and a superstar in Basic Instinct.  The late Shakespearean actor Paul Daneman gives an incredibly effective performance as Lord Bredon.

The picture quality is good in this DVD and the sound quality is acceptable.  The movie was filmed in mono, so don't expect 5.1.  There are no DVD extras.

If you like a love story, this is one of the best.",1141257600,41,1173,4.533333333333333

Sharon Stone was absolutely great in this romance saga. which she plays the part of  a woman looking for her past. left only with a letter after her mother died. with instructions to deliver it to a Lord Bredon. When she attempted to deliver it, he was mean and nasty to her.
