7839962,5,6303140327,"I watched this documentary for the first time almost 20 years ago when I was in my first or second year of college. As a kid I was a big fan of space exploration and followed all things space related with the same zealotry that soccer fans follow their teams. I eventually bought this tape through Amazon a few years ago and I have watched it many times since. It's awesome the type of feats that the previous generation of engineers was able to accomplish. The Voyager missions were designed in the 1970s and they have gone to explore beyond anything any human could have imagined. While 30-40 years ago the best and brightest designed the Voyager, this generation's brains are focused on Twitter, Facebook and equally stupid ideas. If there was ever a case to be made that money prostitutes things, this is it.",1344211200,,812,4.606896551724138
7839963,5,6303140327,This is the story of the Voyager space probes. Very well told and an excellent story about early space exploration. Great discoveries were made and the mission was a great success. This video is a must for anyone wanting to learn more about the Solar System!,1317686400,,258,4.630434782608695

The only drawback from the student's point of view is that the video is a bit dated, and not as flashy as, say, the ""Universe"" episodes on Jupiter and Saturn that have the more current information from the Galileo and Cassini probes.",1309305600,,378,4.573529411764706
