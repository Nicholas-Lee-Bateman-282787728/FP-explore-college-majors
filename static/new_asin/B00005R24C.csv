1652912,5,B00005R24C,"This is an antiestablishment film, focused on the alienation of the young and the bankruptcy of their lives. It's cruel, outrageous,bizarre and provocative portrait around two decadent characters who fornicate, steal and live according theor own behavior codes.

The plot enriches itself due the presence of the incandescnet beauty of Jeanne Moreau who stars a woman back in circulation after ten years of prison.

You may establish without any doubt this film is the French answer to Easy Rider but gifted with a major scope and conceptual complexity, because it trascends the anecdote.

The enviable cast and the masterful direction of this promising director Bertrand Blier who ewentually who would become in a status filmmaker and one of the most gifted dierctors of his generation.

Mature film from start to finish.!",1120780800,18,822,5.251908396946565
1652913,3,B00005R24C,"Considering the fact that this DVD might be severely cut, this movie is quite frankly very englightening. It is basically a road movie, but actually a metaphor for free love. 2 young men, on a journey through france, commiting hit-and-run crimes (mostly just stealing cars) and having sex with women of all ages. That's the impression what you could get from it.

But below the surface this is a very thoughful, well-told film of typical french style.",1091232000,6,451,4.857142857142857
1652914,3,B00005R24C,"Yes this is a french road movie, which in itself is interesting, but the rather sickening misogyny of the first part of the film makes it often hard to stomach.  So be forewarned as you watch this, for if you are a fan of French cinema and culture, there are some things to be gleaned.  As a portrait of a part of French society in the early seventies, culturally not long after the student riots of '68, the bohemian existentialist anti-bourgeois drifter held a romantic appeal similar to that found in an American equivalent to this film, Easy Rider. The relationship between the two men and the much older Jeanne Moreau actually subverts the film's early presentation of women as sexually and intellectually inept; yet her untimely end does nothing to truly mark her sexual freedom as empowered or stronger than that of poor miou miou who is pretty much a stereotyped kitten throughout, even when she learns to ""enjoy"" her freedom with the men at film's end.
Ultimately, if you are seeking an ""amelie"" or ""il postino"" or some other such Eurofilm fun, avoid this.  But if you watch french films for some insight into the culture, this one is worth seeing.  However, be prepared for some pretty brutal treatment of women.  Nonetheless, the men are all largely bourgeois dupes or ""liberated"" trash too, so at least the film is egalitarian in its disdain for stereotypical gender roles. It is interesting to watch this film in tandem with Truffaut's ""the man who loved women"" for some insight into one aspect of the French view of women.",1045872000,12,1536,4.737827715355805

1652916,2,B00005R24C,"I took this video sight unseen, in part, because it was previously screened on PBS.  My thinking was that if it was good enough for national broadcast, it probably wasn't all that bad.  I should have known better.  Looking forward to my family's trip to the Olde Sod in the near future, I  also looked forward to images that would get us pumped up.
Going  Places, as it turned out, was maybe a notch above a home video.  It  depicted a young American man from Washington, DC as he came over to make  tracks around the country in a rented caravan.  It started by showing him  bridling the horse - a scene that took up almost 5 minutes.  Another scene  took up an inordinated amount of time showing him at the hall of records  researching his roots.
It contrasted this yong man's trip to Ireland  with an elderly couple - American again - checking into a bed and breakfast  and later checking out bicylces and attending a make-believe Medeival  dinner and cabaret at a real-live, honest-to-goodness, oh-how-quaint  castle.  Golly, gee whiz, the workers all dressed up in frilly period  costumes, and all, even sounded like the real thing, calling the sightseers  in attendence for the Medeival banquet ""My Lady, My Lord"" and so  forth.  Great stuff for the packaged tour AMEX traveller, but not for  travellers who like to get out and see the real places with the way the  people really are in real life.
I would have liked this video more if  it had shown Ireland and the Irish people the way the naturally are. (I  realize this is open to lots of interpretations) As it was, the film showed  Americans going to touristy places and doing touristy things.  There was  far too much dialogue compared to images.  It lingered from scene to scene,  overstaying its welcome in practically each one.  It could have taken us to  an Irish Auction, instead of The Rose of Tralee Festival in which it  followed an American contestant throughout.  There'd be nothing wrong with  showing the great marketplace on Henry Street with real Irish people  hawking their wares.  It could have lavished the screen with more natural  scenery - and Ireland has much.  Too many indoor scenes.  And too much  dialogue - especially with American accents.
Not to be even more  nit-picky, but. . . .Going Places also was lacking in at least one  technical area, if not more.  The color of the Emerald Isle seemed tainted  - more of a pale green - not the vivid hues Ireland is known for - and what  I remember from being there.
In spite of the fact that the film mostly  showed Americans making their rounds to the usual tourist traps, this could  have been redeeming, if not interesting, if the pacing wasn't so slow,  dwelling on so many impertinent aspects such as bridling a horse or a  make-believe Medeival show.  To its credit, it spared us from having to see  them kissing the Blarney Stone.
I cannot speak for others, but when I go  abroad I do not seek out fellow Americans.  I do not expect to see  Americans hogging space in a film that is ostensibly about another land,  either.  Going Places did exactly that.",961891200,,3094,4.593001841620626

1652948,5,B00005R24C,"""Going Places"" is quite a gem. It's essentially a French road trip story about two misfits who make trouble wherever they go and live on the outskirts of society. Gerard Depardieu is amazing in this early role. So are all of the women in the film-- Miou Miou and Jeanne Moreau. The film is funny, subversive, shocking, innocent, wild, all at once.

1652973,4,B00005R24C,"Other reviewers have done a pretty good job of summing up the plot and what's good about this movie, of which there is much to say. I'm just putting my two cents in to agree with the positive reviews.

Much of the action in the movie is brutal, perhaps not ""A Clockwork Orange"" brutal but not far off either. Yet Jean-Claude and Pierrot in spite of their hedonistic, self-centered tendencies somehow come across as marginally likeable. You hate what they do, but they seem to be trying to adhere to a code of some sort, in which robbery and other indirect harm is somehow okay but they draw the line at gratuitious physical harm (though even there are not against physical harm as a means to a specific end, and they certainly don't think through the full implications of their actions).

For me, what is most meaningful is the portrayal of the women in the movie, in that they share with us the vulnerabiity and one-sidedness of their lives. Giving in to the more powerful, in a society that offers little protection or support, is a sad but pragmatic way to preserve one's existence. Things may not be perfect today, but surely the lives of most Westerner women are far better today than forty years ago when this was made.

If you have the chance to see this with subtitles but _not_ from Amazon's Instance Video collection, that's probably a good idea. The translations here on Amazon made no attempt to preserve the period nature of the work, nor even to elegantly or artfully express the original dialogue. Modern words like ""newbie"" find their way into the subtitles, and my pet peeve, the very annoying and backwards ""could care less"" (instead of ""couldn't care less"") is strewn throughout. Edouard Blinn of TV5 Quebec, credited with the translation, should be emabarassed by his work here.",1389571200,,1798,4.719745222929936
1652974,4,B00005R24C,"Going Places is one of those aimless films that goes nowhere which completely contradicts the title (although the original French title feels more appropriate) and yet feels like it makes sense because of the obvious contradiction.  Two French thugs wander around harassing prostitutes, fighting with pimps, stealing cars and nursing wounds; all the while seeking ways to get their rocks off.  While Bertrand Bliers film may sound pointless, and more importantly rather meaningless, there is something rather refreshing about the whole experience, and both leads (Depardieu and Dewaere) are up to the task of making these boorish young men feel remotely palatable.  They ooze charm, especially Depardieu (its no surprise he became the star he became) and they are supported by a wonderful supporting cast of women, especially the legendary Jeanne Moreau, who makes so much of her small screen time.  Going Places does really go anywhere, despite covering a lot of ground (and stuffing a lot of things into one movie) and yet it feels accomplished, if that makes much sense.",1389225600,,1073,5.22093023255814

Early in the movie they run into Miou-Miou who plays a girl who works in a beauty salon.  Between adventures, they go back to Miou-Miou.  In one of their adventures, they meet Jeanne Moreau, just released from prison, and treat her to a very good time.  Then they find her son just out of prison and try to help him, too.  The son teaches Miou-Miou to enjoy sex, and the guys enjoy being with her much more afterwards.  Later, the three of them meet a very young Isabelle Huppert, whom the guys kind of knew about from breaking into the family's house off season at the beach.

1652997,4,B00005R24C,"It's interesting to see a film such as this from smack dab in the middle of the women's liberation movement as it attempts to capture the 'sea change' in its infancy. Many other reviewers have covered the positive hedonistic and 'life affirming' aspects of the film (which I agree with) already so I'll cover what's gone unmentioned:

Released in 1974 (Amazon has it incorrectly as 1905, which is utterly ridiculous) it juxtaposes two obviously misogynist male leads with a myriad of female characters. Women who are all over the spectrum: one unashamed of her sexuality but takes no pleasure from it, a new mother and wife but who does not deny the opportunity of excitement, a young girl who seeks liberation (literally) from her parents. These women are entirely the devices for plot and character development - these men become more than just 'wild boys' by the end of the film.
However, despite the obvious celebration of these women and their constant struggle against societal norms - the film is still written, directed, and viewed through the male gaze, the masculine lens of the viewer and the object. Very rarely are the personal wishes and desires of these women are fulfilled, regardless of whether they are vocalized or not. Throughout the film these women make objections to the actions and advances of these men, and their desires are overwhelmingly overruled mostly for the sake of the story.

**********Spoiler Alert************
The ""take-home messages"" the viewer is meant to absorb are frequently ""because of"" the male characters:
+ the woman on the train who was breastfeeding was ""more prepared"" to see her husband after her activities with them
+ the woman who is a 'dead fish' in bed is able to find pleasure and sexual satisfaction because of her adventures with them
+ the girl who leaves her parents is liberated, sexually and emotionally, by the two men.

These messages (though eventually semi-positive towards women) are still coming from the perspective of ""if these men hadn't come along and disregarded what these women /thought/ they wanted, they wouldn't be the 'fulfilled' women they are when they are at present"" ... a viewpoint that 1) as a woman and 2) given that this perspective is still widely held today by society - makes me uneasy with wholeheartedly loving this film.

When they do finally meet a female character (played wonderfully by Jeanne Moreau) who is as wild and life affirming as they are, (she already lead a life unapproved by society- she has been caught and been in prison for it) (she is not afraid to talk aloud about her personal feelings about menopause) (she takes the risk of going with these young men on their obvious journey of sexual satiation) she goes one step further and takes her life after their night of revelry. Sure, perhaps it sobers the men about their life of recklessness and disregard toward women, but we get mixed messages of why she did it: why did she shoot herself where she did? Are the viewers meant to assume she never thought her life would get any better or that she would ever feel such satisfaction again so she decided to leave this world ""on a good note""? It contradicts the strong female character we've seen and turns her into mere plot device. If she had gotten out of bed, dressed, stolen the men's money and expensive items then we could have seen a female character who was as truly 'life affirming' as the two men are portrayed.

TL; DR: A great anti-establishment film in a number of ways, but is still a product of its time and doesn't do much to portray women as equal to men.",1370736000,4,3583,4.77258064516129

However, no other French film has impacted me as ""Going Places."" It keeps coming to mind on occasion, for reasons that are hard to describe. This is a movie to be watched over and over every five or ten years, and it is finally available in the Blu-ray format - a must for any film lover.

Grard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere star as two unemployed fellows that spend their days trying new ways to survive and make a quick buck, usually in an illegal way. And this is what the movie is all about: two guys fooling around, making easy money, and bothering people. It looks simple, but their actions and the writing will keep you laughing all the way. During the length of the feature they, among other things, steal a car; kidnap the mistress (the fantastic Miou-Miou) of the owner of the car - she has a recurring role all along the movie --; rob a doctor that cures one of them after being shot for stealing the car; harass a woman who was breastfeeding her son, while traveling by train; steal a motorcycle; steal another car; have sex with the same woman at the same time (""You realize you are in the hands of a stud?'); and have sex with an older woman just released from prison (the wonderful Jeanne Moreau). And, the amazing thing is, you actually like these guys! In fact, there is scene in which they are in the country side, when one of them says, ""You see, when people leave us alone, the simple things make us happy,"" while calmly sharing a meal with stolen money.

There is so much to talk about ""Going Places,"" really. It has the best cast possible, well-acted, with great, funny and witty dialogue, and much more. I guarantee that you won't forget this movie. Ah, I almost forgot: the French title of this film is ""Les Valseuses"" (The Testicles). The Blu-ray includes the theatrical trailer and a stills gallery.

1653023,4,B00005R24C,"This is the type of dark comedy that could only be made in France, it is so un-PC and graphic that it could never have come out of Hollywood.  This film tells the tale of two young men (Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere) who wander around the French countryside causing trouble, creating havoc, looking for women, committing petty (and not so petty) crimes and generally just causing turmoil wherever they go.  This is the film that made Depardieu a star in France in the mid 70s, he and his sidekick Dewaere play off each other wonderfully.  Miou-Miou played the role of the vacuous nymphomaniac quite well also, much different than some of her later, more mature roles.  One of the other reviewers compared this film to Easy Rider, but I think this is a mischaracterization.  This film does not have the philosophic overtones or deeper meaning for a generation that is searching for itself that Easy Rider does.  This is an unusual film, but I think it is more like a dark, violent, sexually explicit predecessor of the Jim Carrey film Dumb and Dumber, without the slapstick and body-function humor.  Maybe this film explores the `angst' of the French youth of the 70's, and explores the newfound social freedom of the French youth at several levels.  The film also takes several violent and completely unexpected turns (ala Pulp Fiction).  I found some of the scenes to be absolutely hilarious.  Bottom line is that this is an unusual (and unusually graphic) film, the subject matter may be offputting to some.

1653024,4,B00005R24C,"I had mixed feelings for ""Les Valseuses"" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching it but I ended up liking it. I would not call it vulgar (""Dumb and Dumber"" is vulgar, ""The Sweetest Thing"" is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I can understand why many viewers, especially, the females would not like or even hate it. It is the epitome of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they'd meet seems unspeakable. But the more I think of it the more I realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem. I am fascinated how Blier was able to get away with it. The movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable: it is well written, the acting by all is first - class, and the music is sweet and melancholic. Actually, when I think of it, two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to: they prepared a woman in the train (the lovely, docile blonde Brigitte Fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in Ren Clment's ""Forbidden Games""(1952) at age 6) for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months; they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) exited and satisfied; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early screen appearances.) Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level. In short, I am not sure I'd like to meet Grard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but I had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring.",1154563200,23,1709,4.570032573289902
1653025,3,B00005R24C,"Though I can appreciate the central performances of Miou Miou, Patrick Dewaere ( as Pierrot) and Gerard Depardieu ( as Jean-Claude) it is not until the legendary Jeanne Moreau shows up as a just released, wary jailbird with a secret, Jeanne Pirolle that I realize what my problem is with Bertrand Blier's ""Going Places"": it lacks humanity, it lacks a heart, it is cold, beautifully made and directed but icy and Moreau's short time onscreen radiates such  warmth and humanity that it thaws this film for the short time that she is around.

Pierrot and Jean-Claude are amoral petty thieves, part-time lovers and full time jerks out for a good time: willing and eager to victimize anyone who deigns to  get near them...for example Miou Miou as a depressed, almost catatonic beautician, Marie-Ange, who exists in Blier's and by extension Pierrot and Jean-Claude's world to taunt, beat and basically rape.

Blier's, who would direct the anarchic, witty and charming ""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"" just four years later with Depardieu and Dewaere, ""Going Places"" amazes on the one hand in it's mean spiritedness and almost total lack of respect for humanity and on the other hand for its brilliant performances and  knife-sharp precise film-making. And as such, ""Going Places"" is like a big, beautiful Chocolate Labrador puppy that wags its tail when you approach but snarls and bites you when you get close.",1151712000,7,1401,5.021551724137931

This crazy sex odyssey is laid out in a way that reminds me of O Lucky Man (w/ Malcolm McDowell)... another early 1970s kooky compilation of endless misadventures.  Here, a couple of 20something misogynistic thugs aimlessly roam the French countryside terrorizing women and pretty much all of humanity.  They seriously have no other purpose beyond their sexual conquests and random mayhem.

Not the film for prudes or the easily offended.  This one seeks to offend and to be as obnoxious as possible!  And for a 1974 film, wow, lol, even if it is French... it's just as racy today, imo.  I'm no prude, nor am I easily offended, but I almost turned it off after the first 10-15 because I thought it was just too silly... but, boy, did it unexpectedly end up drawing me in, heh.

A couple things I liked.  They are drifters with no real purpose and there is an odd beauty in that.  Yet they're so close they share everything, including women... so there are two different relationships in the movie that are threesomes.  One is they latch on to a young prostitute who is a dead fish in bed.  She seems bored by it all and this drives them nuts, lol.  So they spend forever obsessed with her... too hilarious.

Eventually, they decide they need a PASSIONATE woman.  So they hang out at the entrance of a women's prison waiting for one to be released... .believing she will be animal-hungry upon release.  This was my favorite thread because the aging ex-con beauty (a lovely redhead) they stalk like a couple of hoodlums is a fascinating (menopausal) character who ended up shocking me to no end.  Best twisted aging beauty who's dead inside ever next to AHS's Jessica Lange...

Rampant misogyny, 1970s-style.  Stellar cast.  But your PC vegan feminist partner will probably refuse to watch it with you, lol...",1514419200,,1849,4.71875
