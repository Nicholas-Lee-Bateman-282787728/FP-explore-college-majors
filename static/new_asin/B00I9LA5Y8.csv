6255097,5,B00I9LA5Y8,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie (and a self-proclaimed birth junkie) but it really exceeded my expectations! It's well-organized and engaging but also very informational and inspiring. To hear a hospital midwife question her own profession and really cause us all to question our beliefs about where and how birth should happen was powerful!  A must-see for anyone who ever has had a baby or will in the future!,1402358400,,429,4.958333333333333
6255098,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Midwife follows a local Minnesota homebirth midwife as she helps a number of couples birth their babies at home. The intimacy of being in the room with these birthing families and their support teams touches my heart deeply. Kuznia does not shy away from showing less than perfect home births as well. The doc is interspersed with interviews of parents and birth workers discussing the political ramifications of legalized home birth. While not overtly political in tone, Midwife subtly explores the challenges parents encounter in attempting a home birth in a state that does not support birth choice. This is a must see doc for those who support bodily autonomy for women in all areas of life.",1402358400,3,695,4.948717948717949
6255099,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"I thought this movie did a good job of dredging midwifery out of secrecy and into plain view for people to see how safe, comfortable, and natural childbirth can be outside of a hospital. I also really liked the emphasis on the human-to-human connection, and the importance of building up real human bonds and relationships with the people surrounding a woman at this monumentally important life event. Kudos to Kuznia (the filmmaker)!",1402185600,5,434,5.041666666666667
6255100,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Sarah was my midwife, and she's amazing! This documentary will make you laugh and cry, and realize how powerful the woman's body is when guided by the gentle spirit of a midwife.",1395964800,2,178,4.59375
6255101,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Great look into the discussion of why midwives are important and the political landscape that is not always friendly to them. Makes me grateful to live in a state where they are welcome to practice so I have more options for my prenatal and labor/delivery experiences. A good, thoughtful discussion on why midwives are important and their role in different kinds of pregnancies.",1462924800,,378,5.015873015873016

6255103,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Excellent documentary about homebirth, midwives and some of the ridiculous legal loop holes they have to deal with. A poignant film they must be seen.",1462838400,,150,5.04
6255104,5,B00I9LA5Y8,This is a wonderful documentary that all women should watch. It debunks the myth that midwives are not skill.  It voices several concerns of parents and how we should all be able to choose how we birth our babies.,1462838400,,213,4.461538461538462
6255105,5,B00I9LA5Y8,Bummed to see this is unavailable now. I appreciated that amazon was bringing a home birth perspective to its collection of documentaries. This was a thoughtful and interesting film.,1454457600,,182,5.310344827586207
6255106,5,B00I9LA5Y8,This was a wonderful and informative movie. I loved it.,1452470400,,55,4.6
6255107,3,B00I9LA5Y8,"Not much science. I enjoyed the real-life experiences of the women and the labors, but other than that, I thought it was a lot of talking.",1451174400,,138,4.346153846153846
6255108,5,B00I9LA5Y8,A fabulous window into the world of modern home-births. I viewed this movie for a college paper I was writing on the medicalization of childbirth. I found it to be very informative and to beautifully capture why people choose to birth at home. I liked it so much I rented it again!,1451088000,,281,4.423076923076923
6255109,5,B00I9LA5Y8,Wonderful documentary for every couple to watch when expecting.,1447891200,,63,6.111111111111111

6255112,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Very informative and beautifully filmed.  Targets both statistical facts about midwives and home birth, as well as insight from a deeper level.",1440374400,,143,5.5

6255115,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"So good! If you've had a hospital birth and a home birth you know the difference in care. It's amazing. Just to see how gentle newborn exams are done brings it all back to me. The strength of the women to fight for the birth they wan
t and make it through one of the most powerful moments in their lives, with their families. I've watched it twice. I'll watch it again. It leaves me with that empowered feeling after a natural beautiful birth that I worked so hard for. There are some birth shots but in our culture where birth is so hidden and medicalized it's nice to help normalize a natural function on the human body that isn't scary when we know the process and see each other go though what is very natural and happening all over the world ina beautiful and peaceful way.",1428969600,,778,4.299319727891157

6255117,5,B00I9LA5Y8,Love this. Four birth stories from women and the story of a CPM and how she started out. Other great interviews. Just love this!!!,1428969600,,130,4.458333333333333
6255118,4,B00I9LA5Y8,A very interesting view on American Midwifery. I liked all the information in the movie as well.,1428364800,,96,4.705882352941177
6255119,3,B00I9LA5Y8,It might have been better if I hadnt forgotten to watch the rest of it. Sigh...,1427846400,,79,4.0
6255120,5,B00I9LA5Y8,A wonderful transformative film!,1427760000,,32,7.25
6255121,5,B00I9LA5Y8,This was amazing. I like how they show the different between a cpm & a cnm. I also like how they showed the good & the bad of a home birth.,1423958400,,139,3.5161290322580645
6255122,5,B00I9LA5Y8,I liked that this documentary didn't just show rainbows and butterflies like a lot of homebirth documentaries do. There were some legit angry women in this one. And some legit broken hooties. A+,1423526400,,194,4.909090909090909
6255123,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"This documentary is an excellent portrayal of what some of our nation's Certified Professional Midwives are up against in states that do not support or protect midwives or the rights of mothers to choose with whom they give birth and where.  Some states are very progressive and supportive of midwives, and as a result the practice of midwifery in these states blossoms.  Supporting midwifery is a win for CPMs and mothers who can easily find numerous options.  Limiting Certified Professional Midwives ability to practice also limits some mothers access to their preferred care option.  Often midwives leave or are forced out of these unfavorable states to practice in more progressive areas.  As a result, mothers suffer when these midwives leave because with them goes expertise in natural childbirth and respectful, individualized care of mothers and babies during natural childbirth.",1421452800,,888,5.359712230215828
6255124,5,B00I9LA5Y8,Great documentary. Really worth the watch.,1418342400,,42,6.166666666666667
6255125,5,B00I9LA5Y8,Great movie for all moms-to-be!  This is a must watch.  Midwife the movie exposes the truth about midwifery and shows us how safe and natural home birth is.  Love it!  I like to give this as a gift to all my soon to be mama friends!,1416182400,,232,3.9782608695652173
6255126,5,B00I9LA5Y8,This is a beautifully done film that talks about midwifery! I would watch it again and again.,1416182400,,93,4.529411764705882
6255127,4,B00I9LA5Y8,Excellent documentary. It would have had an even greater impact if there was more popular advocates such as Ina May Gaskin etc.,1414886400,,127,4.818181818181818
6255128,5,B00I9LA5Y8,I wish everyone would watch this documentary.  It shows how having a baby naturally at home brings the entire family together and is such a great experience.  It also shows how the government interferes with women/families making their own choice as to how/where they want to have their baby.  It was very informative.,1412467200,,318,4.962264150943396
6255129,4,B00I9LA5Y8,I really enjoyed it!,1412121600,,20,4.25
6255130,3,B00I9LA5Y8,"Not appropriate for certain people.  Wanted to use it for disabled daughter who loved ""A Baby Story"" TV programs (much more modestly done!), which are no longer being aired on TV.  Too much nudity shown here--NO MODESTY in some scenes (Ex.: woman's breast/nipples being manipulated.)  Lots of good info for those wanting to go into midwifery or go to a midwife, but just not what I was expecting/looking for.  Had to return.",1410652800,,424,4.847222222222222

6255132,3,B00I9LA5Y8,OKAY MOVIE,1408406400,,10,4.5
6255133,3,B00I9LA5Y8,"While I enjoyed watching the midwife interact with her patients and hearing all the different couple's stories, this movie was more ""feel good"" than informative. I think we all need to be getting the statistics out there showing how home birth is just as safe or safer than hospital birth for low risk pregnancies. I could see this movie just enforcing the opinion many people hold that mothers who birth at home do it only for the warm and fuzzy experience when really it has just as much or more to do with safety and health measures for mother and baby.",1404172800,11,556,4.514851485148514
6255134,5,B00I9LA5Y8,I highly recommend you watch this documentary. It's different from others that I have seen on the subject. It opens your eyes a little more on how some women are unable to have the birth they want due to legalities that midwives face.,1403222400,2,234,4.465116279069767
6255135,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"I've seen various birth documentaries (The Business of Being Born, Orgasmic Birth, etc) and this is my favorite. It is interesting, well-paced, inspiring and informative.",1403049600,,170,5.84
6255136,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"A true work of art, this documentary explores homebirth in several Midwestern states where legality varies. It follows one homebirth midwife in her care of three families prenatal through post partum. You see three homebirths where, despite variations and complications, mom and baby are well cared for by knowledgeable and experienced midwives, helping to dispel the myth that ""homebirth isn't safe"" when variations and/or complications occur. The documentary also focuses on a few states where homebirth attended by a midwife is illegal leading to the question of who owns birth-birthing families or well meaning but possibly misguided policy makers? Inspirational and beautiful, this documentary is a must see for everyone!",1402444800,4,726,5.609090909090909
6255137,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Wonderful film that shows a homebirth midwife in her first year of practice.  The filmmaker shows what is involved in becoming a homebirth midwife, what the prenatals done by a homebirth midwife are like (and how they differ from a hospital based-practice), and several births at home.  Beautiful!",1402444800,,297,5.166666666666667
6255138,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"This film gives a rare and personal look at the work of the homebirth midwife, as well as the births of women and their families who choose to birth at home.  Midwifery is truly a work of the heart, and this film portrays this beautifully in a simple and lovely way.",1402358400,,266,4.215686274509804
6255139,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"People who choose to birth at home and the midwives that attend those births are not freaks, not heroes and not hippies (mostly :) ).  This film does an excellent job of showing how these parents and midwives are simply people who see that a normal, uncomplicated birth does not need to happen in a medical environment.

Kuznia's filmmaking debut is a strong first step on the path to wider exposure and acclaim in the field.",1402358400,2,425,4.578947368421052
6255140,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"I thought this film did a great job of educating us about the different types of midwifery as we follow a midwife and get follow real families through the process of birthing at home. I especially found it interesting hearing from the homebirth midwife who used to be a hospital midwife and the hospital midwife who used to be a homebirth midwife.  It was such an interesting conversation about the differences.

Additionally, I like that there was such a variety of births shown and that some even had what one would consider ""complications"" yet the midwife was fully knowledgable and trained to handle all of these situations at home.  I think a lot of people think that having a homebirth midwife is like having a lady come over with hot towels and prayers.  Yet, these women are highly skilled and trained and are going to be the first one to transfer to hospital if something look like it shouldn't be handled at home.",1402358400,6,923,4.644171779141105
8640201,4,B00I9LA5Y8,"Excellent portrayal from the time she goes to sit for the NARM exam into the early days of her solo practice. There were families from a variety of backgrounds and previous experiences who were all seeking the care of a midwife. I feel the heartache of the midwife who legally cannot practice in Iowa and the mothers whose care suffers because of lack of services. I appreciate the women who continue fighting for rights to choose care providers.

Would recommend to childbirth students, Doula clients, those with an interest in womens rights.

Licensure doesnt always equal competency.",1517875200,,586,5.030927835051546
8640202,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"I would recommend all my friends and family to watch this film!!!! Before I watched this film, I was afraid of having babies, period! Now I feel so relieved and excited! And I love how home births are more natural!! Most of my haunting thoughts of child birth have completely turned around. I believe home births will be the direction I will go when I get to that chapter in my life. I want to continue my research on the topic! It's a fascinating process! Thank you to everyone one that put so much hard work into this production! It has helped me and will help many more woman understand what home births can truly offer us and our new baby!!",1510790400,,644,4.330578512396694
8640203,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"Good film, lots of information though it's definitely a bit biased. Very informative, would recommend.",1508976000,,102,5.866666666666666
8640204,3,B00I9LA5Y8,"I liked that information this documentary brought about home birth. Out of hospital birth and midwives aren't as well known in the US as they should be and this documentary is helpful and educational. With that being said, I do not like the negative light it casts on hospital birth. The only hospital midwife they interviewed had a bad experience in the hospital setting and that's the only opinion they showed on the subject. I know hospital based midwives who love their jobs and always have patients treated with respect. It is a documentary so I figured it would be a bit one-sided but I didn't think it would be this bad.",1483488000,,627,4.607142857142857
8640205,3,B00I9LA5Y8,It was OKAY.,1478390400,,12,3.3333333333333335
8640206,5,B00I9LA5Y8,"I love that this shows the real side of giving birth naturally (giving birth in anyway, actually) how some women need to labor inward and some just need to let the energy out, how the midwives and doulas can melt into the background or be a strong voice and the risks they take to do what they love and to help women take control of their births! I LOVED my midwife birth and documentaries like this are what gave me the courage to have the birth I always wanted!!!",1470787200,,465,4.235955056179775
