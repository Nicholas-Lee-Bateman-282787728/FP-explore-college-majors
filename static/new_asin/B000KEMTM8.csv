8155885,2,B000KEMTM8,"One day a mysterious person comes to stay at an inn ran by a boy and his mother. It is obvious that this stranger led a rough sea going life. What was not obvious is that events with his previous associates would eventually lead to adventure and ""Treasure Island.""

The only thing in this movie that relates to the book or the other movie versions is the Title.

Half of the characters are missing. Much of the dialog is missing. The whole point of the story is missing. It was not necessary for the movie as other movie versions did not do this.

In an attempt to be cutesy Byron Haskin lost the mystery and the morals of Treasure Island. You definitely do not want to spend any money on this version (Bobby Driscoll)

A better choice is Treasure Island (1990) Charlton Heston, Christian Bale.
For that matter ""Muppets Treasure Island"" is closer to the book and the singing is better.",1500422400,,885,4.478260869565218

Whether it was because of the age of the print (it was apparently in its original container) or this was a bad print I don't know; the poor quality took a lot of the enjoyment out of showing this to my grandchildren.",1320710400,,295,4.381818181818182
