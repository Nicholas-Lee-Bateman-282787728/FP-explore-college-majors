808362,5,6304192703,"Reading throught the reviews I was surprised that some people didn't like this video!  I love it and my 2 year old daughter LOVES it.  I catch her outside doing different yoga posses in her sandbox!  After performing yoga poses (purely her idea!) for the whole family now, we call her yoga meister.  ANYWAYS,:) I love this video because I feel good about her watching it.  She is interacting with the video and moving about, not just sitting there watching TV.  It has cute songs- and so soothing. The setting is also calming and beautiful.  I think the video sends a calm-happy-loving message through its songs and setting.  It is recommended for 3 years up- but both my daughter and her cousin love it and they are 2.  It isn't [pricey], worth every cent.",1024272000,18,757,4.58955223880597
808363,5,6304192703,"I bought this video on the recommendation of several different people.  My son (who is 2.5) loves it, and i love it too.  He enjoys doing the 'tree pose', 'snake pose', and 'lion pose'.  People should be warned though, it is new agey (which doesn't bug me at all, since i am pretty new agey myself! LOL!). The yoga-mama talks about how we are all interconnected, and you learn how to say ""Ommm..."", etc. The songs are sweet and gentle, and each pose is illustrated by different images of animals or nature scenes.  We play this video for a little bit at a time, since it is divided into sections you don't have to watch the whole thing at a time.  It is a very gentle and lovely...it is the only video that my son watches.",1021075200,15,722,4.279411764705882
808364,2,6304192703,"This video was purchased for my daughter, Age 5, who has a good sence of balance and long attention span.  The length of time spent explaining and demomstrating the poses is not long enough.  I have found that pausing the tape, re-explaining the pose and helping her adjust her position is the only way that she learns the poses.  There is nothing said about how to adjust the pose for comfort or where you should feel the strech.  The animal segments between the poses are distracting and disturbs the continuity of the ""work out"".  The animal noises suggested may be intended to encorage the chidren to enjoy yoga but I feel it detracts from the sence of peace and relaxation you feel after your practice.  My daughter is in such a hurry to make the noise that the pose becomes secondary.  I will purchase a book and use that to help us form our yoga practice.  This tape will not be used.",995500800,13,891,4.45679012345679
808365,5,6304192703,"This was the tape that made me decide to start teaching yoga to children. Thank you. It's good to use with the kids before bedtime because they can watch it or do it, either way it relaxes them. We need a YogaTeens now!",975369600,4,219,4.116279069767442
808366,4,6304192703,"My 2 yearold son wants to watch this video twice a day - we are NO TV- o videofreaks, but this is vey wonderful to watch and practice together.  Since I do yoga myself I was very happy to find this video to be able to  introduce yoga for my son. I find it inspiring too as a teacher and will  try this on a group of 4-yearolds.",966384000,3,327,3.7794117647058822
808367,5,6304192703,"My four year old daughter loves this video.  She has always been fascinated by yoga because she sees me doing it and until I saw this video I had no means to help her do it.  This video is fantastic for many  reasons.  First, it's got lots of kids doing the poses, so that kids can  really relate to them.  Second, the poses are pretty simple (although some  are a little more challenging).  Third, the video also focuses on love and  respect of nature.  Finally, there are some great little songs on the  video.  All in all, my daughter has a great time with this video and she is  so happy that she has her own yoga practice.  It's great that now if she  has a little leg cramp, I can tell her to do downward dog and she knows  what I am talking about.  She is very proud to be a ""Yoga Kid""  and I think most other children would be as well.",961372800,26,843,4.036585365853658
808368,5,6304192703,"It's so wonderful to be able to introduce youngsters to some of the concepts offered by this tape (like connectedness to everything around us) in a way that's not ""hit over your head"" obvious.  My older boy  does some of the postures-his favorites are Volcano pose & Turtle pose.  His younger brother watches intently & loves seeing the kids on the  tape.  He's not quite up to the postures yet, but he copies the noises that  go with the animals. I've also found it very helpful to remind them of the  postures when they're really upset or wired...they seem to be able to calm  down pretty quickly when given the Lion pose or bunny breathing to do.  On  the whole - a great tape for kids (& I like it too!)",911520000,4,707,4.32824427480916
7864666,3,6304192703,"Unfortunately this video is not what I thought it would be. My expectation was that it would be more like an exercise video. However, the kids don't move from one pose to another. There is time in between where there are no poses going on and we sit and wait for the next pose to begin. My daughter is 22 months. She enjoys the Mom and Toddler Fitness DVD from Parents much more than this video. We like this video, but it is not exactly what we were looking for.",1237161600,,463,4.155555555555556
7864667,5,6304192703,"My daughter got this tape from her cousins after they were done with it. Now she wants to do it (not just watch it!) every day!!

 So now I am going to have to check out Yoga Kids 2 and 3. She is only 3 years old, and last time we were at the library she came running up to me and said, Look Mama! I found a book about Yoga!! I am delighted that she is so into something that is so very good for her! Thanks Marsha!!

7864668,5,6304192703,"This set of videos featuring Marsha Wenig, founder of YogaKids, was developed for children ages 3-8. Kids sing silly songs while performing assorted fun and funny yoga asanas. Children learn basic yoga techniques presented in a relaxed setting. This is especially suitable for younger yogis who may not have a long attention span or an interest in holding a pose for long periods of time.
In addition to exercising their bodies children are given the opportunity to expand their minds with mini lessons that open them up to the world around them. Little animal lovers will enjoy performing poses that mimic the movements of seals, snakes, and lions.
These tapes are a favorite of my five-year-old daughter Sarah and my almost three-year-old niece, Ashlee. --Michelle Smith",1078099200,10,772,5.134920634920635
7864669,4,6304192703,"We have tried several children's yoga videos with varying degrees of success.  This video has a nice clear picture and sound.  All the poses (with the exception of the handstand) are possible for both parent and child to do without any practice.  My daughter has been using this video since she was 2 and is now almost 5.  When she was younger she would often get bored during the video transitions between poses.  Now she can make it through the whole video without running off to do something else.  But she loved doing the poses and we both enjoyed the playful way the poses were presented.  We recommend this one, as well as Yoga Fitness For Kids Ages 3-6.",1071705600,3,660,4.495798319327731
7864670,5,6304192703,"My son received this video as a gift for his 3rd birthday, and now we purchase it everytime we attend a 3rd birthday party!  At first, I was worried that my very energetic son would not have the patience to learn yoga, but this video moved along from one pose to the next quickly, and really kept his interest.  The only problem we have now is that everytime I go to do one of my yoga videos in the morning, my son wants us to do his instead.  I especially liked the way that the video teaches about the importance of breath.  Everything is taught in a way that is easily understood and absorbed by a young child.  Great video to give as a Christmas gift this year!",1070323200,2,665,4.1640625
7864671,5,6304192703,Great video! Very relaxing. My 5yr old daughter and i like to do this right before nap.,1070064000,,87,4.176470588235294
7864672,4,6304192703,"My boys, ages 7 & 8, enjoyed this video.  It was very age appropriate and well paced for children.  I take yoga at the gym and found this video to be a great introduction to yoga for kids.  The only thing that I didn't like was the head stand pose, because it is a difficult pose for children and it generally isn't done in a yoga class.  The pace of the video was slow, but for yoga that is appropriate.  If your kids can't sit still, this is NOT the video for you.",1057017600,6,466,3.967741935483871
7864673,3,6304192703,"I rented this video from the library before purchasing to make sure it was what I wanted. After watching it, I don't think I'd buy it. I'll probably look into some other exercise options.
Yoga Kids is a pretty good yoga introduction for kids ages 4 to 6 (once you fast forward through about 15 minutes of credits, commercials and legal warnings about exercise). Basically, the narrator uses examples from nature to teach various yoga poses. The production value is good and the children are modestly dressed and good models of the poses.
Christian parents should be aware, however, that there is a good deal of New Age philosophy mixed in with the instruction. This is the main reason I'm rating it 3 stars. (If you don't find this kind of philosophy objectionable, you'd probably rate it higher.)",1048377600,13,797,4.782608695652174
7864674,2,6304192703,"I failed to heed the warnings of the parent reviews... and bought this thinking it'd be great for my preschooler and 6 year old.  It took FOREVER to get through opening credits and warnings.  There's so much space between movements that after each one, my kids thought it was over!  This video is simply awful because it's so boring.  My kids know what a yoga workout looks like and they were very confused that there was so much added ""fluff"" to their yoga tape.  My 4 year old has NEVER uttered the words ""this is boring"" in his life and has the patience of a saint...and he said it within 5 ten minutes of the tape (and I had already fast-forwarded throught he credits).",1045699200,12,673,4.395161290322581
