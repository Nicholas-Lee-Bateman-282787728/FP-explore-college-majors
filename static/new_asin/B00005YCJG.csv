From the 1980s Apple computers and printers that make up the inside of the tank to the stock footage of various explosions, Iron Thunder never ceases to underwhelm.  I'm not sure which character I associated with most, but I think it's a toss up between the silent and mysterious stoic man of ambiguous ethnicity and the disgruntled squad leader, tortured by his recurring fear of water that always seems to pop up at the most inconvenient times... like when having sex in the desert.

This film is not without merit, though.  As aforementioned, it is terrible, but it is hilarious.  Were it billed as a comedy, I might be giving this movie five stars.  This movie sets a new low in all levels of film production.  The visible mic stands tend to be more entertaining than most of the actors.  However, I can't say I'm not better off after having seen this movie; I've seen the worst and now the best shines even brighter.",1121212800,2,1047,4.591397849462366
