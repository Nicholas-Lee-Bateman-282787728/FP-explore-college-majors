The interviews with the fans and crew are great and the bonus festival performances are great as well. Highlights from the show for me were Smile like you mean it, Spaceman, Bling, and When You Were Young. And make sure to check out festival performance of Smile like you mean it it's the 50/50 version, very cool.",1257897600,,403,4.534246575342466
3972183,5,B002RBZ13Q,"This doesn't get released till November 10th, 2009. But, I just saw it in theaters (it was in very select theaters on Nov. 5, 8pm). It's every bit as good as I hoped it would be. I was lucky enough to be near a theater that played this just a few hours ago, there were only 8 in the whole state of California that was playing this. Visuals were amazing, and the sound was superb. It's not easy to fill a place like Royal Albert Hall with as much intensity, energy and passion as the Killers have done. The stage was attractive and familiar if you've been to a Killers show. The shots were well filmed and the sound capture was good as well. I can't wait to get this and play the **** of my surround system.

Update:
Received it in the mail the day the DVD/Bluray was released. Way to go Amazon!
My rating of 5/5 remains unchanged. This release is every bit deserving of 5 stars. I know it isn't clear on the Amazon page, but the Blu-ray version does NOT come with a CD. The DVD version does. However, that is more of Amazon's fault for not listing correctly, so I disagree with the reviewers who let this affect their review of the Bluray. Product reviews should pertain only to the product, IMO.

This Blu-ray is great because the concert itself was great. The Killers are probably one of the best live bands in the world today. This movie release brings the Killers concert experience into the home very, very well. The energy from the band is amazing and Brandon Flowers is left gasping for air at some points.

Just buy it, you will not regret it.",1257379200,27,1551,4.323024054982818

3972228,5,B002RBZ13Q,"The best concert bluray I own (and I own quite a few). Not only are the sound and picture outstanding, but so are the content, the performances and the extras. They knocked it out of the park on this one. I am biased because I love The Killers (even the songs with stupid lyrics), but I'm a pretty tough critic of concerts, even if I love the band. For instance, R40 Live, by Rush is expertly done, but the band's performance is annoying much of the time (mostly Geddy's voice).

When the Killers first came out, I thought it was a ""Simple Minds"" rebirth ( ""Don't you, forget about me."" )  The voices are so similarly great ( like when Mariah Carey first came out, I thought of Whitney Houston )

3972369,5,B002RBZ13Q,"The Killers prove that arena rock is alive and well.  And let's face it, there are very few bands out there today - who came out in the past 10 years - that can fill arenas.  The only disappointment for me watching this DVD was that America has not embraced and appreciated The Killers the way the UK has.  I would have loved to have been at this show.  The energy is amazing watching this DVD. As one reviewer so eloquently put it - do not be fooled by Brandon Flowers' boyish good looks or that he looks like the guy who just packed your groceries at the supermarket, He's the quintessential frontman who grabs the audience by the throat and immediately makes it part of the show. The rest of the band - Dave, Ronnie, and Mark, are equally gifted at their respective crafts as well.  I'm looking forward to a new DVD from the Wembley show.",1375833600,3,841,4.2974683544303796

3972377,5,B002RBZ13Q,The Blue-ray is simply amazing.  Watching this in a 7.2 surround sound system will leave you feeling like you were there in the hall with the band.

  recordings ever presented in history, The Killers have gave their highly anticipated live
  concert performance at Londons Royal Albert Hall which not only got the international
  acclaim it fully deserved, but the absolute fanfare from some of their fans from across
  the globe who attended.  Whats really amazing about the live landmark extravaganza
  is that it not only captures the band at its best, but it also feature the breathtaking live
  atmosphere, a series of brief interviews with some fans who had waited outside Royal
  Albert Hall, electrifying live sets, finesse, band camaraderie, electrifying performances
  and dazzling live footage of the band performing onstage.  Plus, the DVD also include
  several live performances the band gave at several rock festivals in both Great Britain
  and Ireland at the same time prior to the concert DVDs widespread release in 2009
  it would even be selected from an international critics poll as The Best Live Recording
  Of 2009 in both the general music and rock categories with astounding results).  With
  over 2% hours of spectacular footage and eye-filling theatrical aura, Live At The Royal
  Albert Hall feature a special acoustic solo piano introduction of When We Were Young
  as it concludes with the fans who had waited outside Royal Albert Hall as they enjoyed
  the live event, a behind the scenes look inside the event, interviews with the crew and
  live renditions of their greatest hits from the 2000s.  Consisting of two nights the band
  performed at The Royal Albert Hall, Brandon Flowers officially stated that the decision
  to film the concert DVD there is because at he pointed out: London always been very
  good to us. They opened their arms to us before anybody else did. And they believed
  that Royal Albert Hall performance is a very special and iconic venue to perform there.
  (one of his biggest influences was Morrissey, to whom he grew up watching his music
  videos that were filmed there). Ever since The Killers have first introduced themselves
  in the international spotlight in 2004, after there own formation in Las Vegas two years
  earlier, the band would hit a full house with their rise to international fame and fortune,
  which have resulted with four hit albums during the 2000s and a steady tour schedule.
  You know, this has got to be one of the most breathtaking and highly anticipated SRO
  live events ever captured in any medium, which is the kind of live music extravaganza
  that will always leave quite an everlasting influence on countless generations to come.

The last song, When You Were Young, by itself, is worth the price of admission.  Incredible performance in an amazing  concert hall.

Hey, I'm 51 years old.  I grew up with Boston, Journey, Fog Hat, Queen, and all that.  But, the music of groups like The Killers, The Kings of Leon, Snow Patrol, Coldplay, The Stereophonics, and so forth may be the best music in my lifetime.

This concerts is great for is raw energy.  If you're a fan of the Killers you'll love seeing your band perform.  If you're someone who knows some of the songs, you'll be a huge Killers fan after watching this concert.

Look at the play list.  They're playing all your favorites plus some songs that maybe you don't know but will enjoy all the same.

The audio is great and the sound really pops.  The lighting and staging add to the over all experience.  Yes, it's like all concerts shot lately in that most of the video clips are a second or two long.  But it's fine and is extremely watchable.  I also watched all the bonus material and found it really interesting.

And, as a bonus, I bought the DVD that came with the CD.  So, now I can drive around and listen to The Killers in the car.  Which means that all day long at work I've got Human playing in my head over, and over, and over.

Gives one a good idea of the high energy concert this band delivers. Unfortunately the audio track is lackluster. Biggest issue we had is with stadium echo (present on every audio option of disk). This is unnecessary & distracting. Also bass is weak and drum cymbals not best.  Sounds like it was produced using mics located offstage as opposed to direct feed, doubt this was so, but why else should there be echo?",1324944000,5,570,4.643564356435643

""Shadowplay""?! I could go on and on. I am very happy for the accompanying audio CD as well. The songs on the CD sound slightly different than the audio on the DVD.

Much more than a jam session, much more than great musicians, much more than the great music, you have to watch this simply for the pure concert experience.

With the preceding noted, every single band member is great and the lead singer,  Brandon Flowers, works hard to please the fans, giving the impression of being a polite, and friendly, Southern gentleman.

(If you love the blu-ray, I strongly suggest getting the CD/DVD version too.  The CD, which has most of the live songs, is mixed somewhat differently, giving a great sounding and slightly different aural experience.)",1307145600,2,656,4.927272727272728

  In the United States our educational system remains ignorant of the benefits and strong intellectual drive that Music, Art, and Dramatic interepretation have within our young minds.  Athletics have become the normally financial money maker.  However, now, in a world with 'Obviously so many people capable of much, much more talent; we sadly sod on with a hopeless dream, and our children remain intellectually inept, with rare exceptions; and, with no thanks to our educational system.  These individuals are like all of the rest of you: hoping that Simon Cowell !, or another smart seer will harness your talents.
  This band did not find success untill it was discovered untill the Britons 'Heard' their 'Music'.

  Wake up America- do away with the pretences and dream of physical greatness athletically, gives our musicians and artists a chance.  Support them and do not hinder their promise.

  Nike, iPhone, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc, etc, etc:  consider paying it forward.  You 'Great' companies can do something to change this, and still make a profit.  Use your minds, directed toward giving our own people the chance to make and receive the benefit of your excessive benefit and monetary hoard.  Give our country the ability to make and survive independentally.  Do not send away our creative talents and gifts to other countries to benefit, solely.  Our, 'Bill', is too enormous to pay away now.  Stop and think.
  This great land of ours will be bought out, and lost to us unless: Greed, Selfishness, Vanity, and a host of other virtue absent goals are abandoned.

  I'm sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.

  May God protect and bless our great nation always.  Amen

3972499,5,B002RBZ13Q,"Having grown up in the 80's, music for me was pretty much done after the early '90s...  the ubiquity of rap and hip-hop killed my every desire to listen to new music. Fortunately one day I stumbled onto this concert on Palladia TV, and was at first pleasantly surprised, and then completely transfixed by the energy, intensity, pure musical talent, and more than anything, the range, variety and sheer volume of quality music by a band that didn't exist until 2002.  With every song, my incredulity grew at the fact that these ""kids"" had so many songs that I'd never heard before, but that I thoroughly enjoyed, even the first time around.

I immediately bought the Blu-Ray DVD, and I've recommended it to many friends and relatives.  I'm amazed that The Killers aren't yet as big as U2, The Police or Queen; it's probably just a matter of time until they get there.  I'm also surprised that this isn't among the best-selling concert DVDs ever... it quickly moved to the top of my fairly large collection.

Get the Blu-Ray DVD; you'll be glad you did.",1298505600,2,1051,4.654054054054054

Now that I think about it there wasn't much to write home about on the low frequency end of the audio spectrum as well. This disc just has dull lackluster sound.

If you want to hear just how good a blu ray concert disc can sound try these excellent examples of superb blu ray sound: The Police Certifiable, Chris Botti in Boston.",1297555200,,494,4.2105263157894735

I found the CD/DVD combo of the Royal Albert Hall performances and was instantly sold. The only problem I have now is which CD to listen to since I picked up the other four and Mr. Flowers' solo work the following day! Massively talented band and incredible performers, loved the energy and diversity of their set list, anticipate that they'll be a permanent fixture in my music collection from now on.",1296259200,,579,4.2727272727272725

3972519,5,B002RBZ13Q,"I bought this on a lark... I knew a couple of their songs and figured that, for this price, it was worth checking them out. A few viewings later, and I'm hooked, and I'm a big Killers fan.  God, these guys can write songs, and they really do create a different atmosphere song-by-song during the show.  Very powerful live presence.

And, let's face it, Brandon Flowers is most of the show, and the guitarist is probably a good songwriter but not a great musician, and that's just the state of the band.  I'd love to see them with a more confident and powerful guitarist, and it would bring them up to the next level to have that, but even without that this is an amazing show.  Interesting that both Maroon 5 and The Killers are getting it done without a great guitarist these days....

Anyway, I've been watching and listening to this disc every day for a week or so, can't get the songs out of my head, it's so worth buying, cheaper than a concert ticket and a better view.  And, of course, you want the Blu-Ray disc with DTS-HD Master Audio, and you want an amplifier that's capable of delivering the flawless sound contained on that audio track.",1283817600,2,1149,4.442857142857143

Lighting and stage design is great. It really puts on a great display - especially coupled with an HDTV and Surround sound. I've never had the chance to see them live - but this was probably the next best thing - in some ways better. The multiple angles and clean sound make the experience a little more pleasant than the sometimes rough sound at a bad theater setting.

3972571,5,B002RBZ13Q,"The Killers - Live From Royal Albert Hall is an excellent concert video, revealing The Killers as brilliant musicians, both individually and in ensemble. Ronnie Vannucci's drums beat at the center of this astounding group like the steady heart of a seasoned jazz musician: always alive, always responsive to the band, always in perfectly chosen tempo. Dave Keuning, on guitars, is lightyears beyond the generalized strumming of most rock chord-players, speaking to us articulately and beautifully with his nimble fingers. On Bass, Mark Stoermer is powerful and elegant, never missing a step, or beat, and is vigilantly alert to his fellow musicians, always nuanced.

The group inspires total confidence, which is in no small part due to the astonishing talent of Brandon Flowers, a singer whose grasp of vocal possibility, both technically and creatively, is far beyond his years. His pastiche of power, nuance, simplicity, refinement, flawless technique, and elegance place him solidly in the pantheon of great singers. Did I mention power? At 28, he has a command of his instrument, and an insight into it's mysteries, that most advanced artists do not begin to approach before they are in their 40's. And like all the greatest musicians, he is always listening: watch him listen to the band, to his audience. Simply put, he is a phenomenon: delivering unbroken passion in perfect balance with his skill. Never missing a note or moment of connection, his attention is always with his audience, with giving them the best, and ALL of it. And they are ready and willing to take him up on his offer.

The concert DVD / Blu-ray is first rate, mostly due to The Killers all-around brilliant talent as performers and composers, Flowers' lyrics always interesting, always impressionistic and captivating. The audience of fans delivers what has come to be expected by Killers followers: total enthrall and open-hearted excitment. Killers fans are always smiling. And as this concert proves, so are The Killers. Seldom, if ever, have I seen a band (or solo performer) project such open-hearted enjoyment, pure joy, at making music.

3972592,5,B002RBZ13Q,"I've become a fan of the Killers over the past year, and they are proving to be the heir apparent to the likes of U2 and Bruce Springsteen.  It's clear they made an investment in producing a state of the art concert film here, and in effect have set a high bar for other bands to reproduce.  The visuals are stunning within Royal Albert Hall, with the cameras taking you on a journey from an empty venue to them taking the stage.  The sound is amazing, and if you have a surround system, THIS IS the benchmark for testing out your system.  Their body of work holds up well over the whole concert.  No duds, but for me, some new thoughtfully written songs that I now know!

One review I read online by a music critic compared this to Elvis Presley's Hawaii concert film.  A very good comparison.  However, The Killers, benefit from digital technology that perfects the experience.",1262217600,2,879,4.484276729559748

3972594,5,B002RBZ13Q,"Let me start out by saying first off that I like my music! More so, I like a great live performance! This concert ranks right up there with some of the best I have seen. Many bands can make a good studio album. And the studio can make a good band sound better than they really are. I have spent lots of money over the years going to live concerts. Sometimes to find out that a band we thought was sure to give a good performance, was actually a snoozer. What a let down! I only own a few DVD concert videos-all of these include great live bands. This was my first Blu-Ray concert video purchase and I was blown away. All facets of this video were done close to perfection. I will name a few reasons why: The venue, the camera angles, lighting, special effects, set, fan interaction/participation, and most of all THE BAND! The sound was incredible!

I have always liked the Killers music, but never realized how diverse it was. Never even owned one of their albums before buying this concert footage. What turned me on to it was the fact that I heard ""When you were young"" on the radio. No, it wasn't the first time I'd heard the song, but it was the live version from the Royal Albert Hall concert. It sounded great live, and you could sort of feel the energy of the live show. After the song, I took note of where the live show was played at... Long story short, after checking out a short preview clip from another unnamed music store I found myself on Amazon looking to secure a Blu-Ray copy before the release! Glad I did. I have watched it 3 times with different people and they too were all wowed by the overall performance. All had the same comments-couldn't believe how good they really were. Sound even better live!

I recommend anyone to get this concert if you are on the fence. You won't be disappointed! If you have 1080 HD capabilities and a good sound system, go for the Blu-Ray!

3972636,5,B002RBZ13Q,"POSITIVE:  Nearly everything.  This is one of my favorite concert DVD's.  Every song is really really great.  It's upbeat, it's interesting, it's energetic, the musicianship is really excellent, the hall is awesome, the audience enthusiastic.  Despite some little niggles, below, this is a ""if you like the Killers, definitely get this"" kinda deal.

The filming is excellent, if a bit too frenetic at times.  It does capture the excitement and the great lighting well.  It'd be nice to focus on one musician for longer periods, especially when they're doing cool stuff.  I liked the theme of the camera moving into the hall, and following the band, and then leaving at the end.  The bit following the lead out into the hall (and lowering the sound) and then to the balcony was a nice touch.

MINOR GRIPE: My only real critical comment is about sound quality....where did the cymbals go?  You can barely hear them in the mix and the drummer is amazing, so we're missing some really cool stuff.  I tried playing this on my friend's system (same problem), checked that my system was working, all channels, because literally, the cymbals are mostly lost.  You can hear them from a distance, especially when nothing else is playing, but there is no direct sound.  All the subtle stuff you can see him doing is barely audible.  This is a huge loss as the whole concert would be richer with these percussive details.  How did they miss this in the sound room?

In general the sound is OK, but not the DVD's strong point.  I've heard much better mixes on DVD's where you can hear each instrument distinctly, the singer's voices are clear and strong, and the sense of space is captured.  If there's one place for the producers to improve on, it's the sound quality.  (Bluray doesn't fix that, of course, because if it's not recorded well, the format won't fix it.).

OK, end of gripe section- the concert is awesome  and the DVD is still totally worth it!",1260748800,,1946,4.6923076923076925

I was watching it on my 54"" plasma one random night (the show was an hour long on TV) and I couldn't turn the channel after hearing one song (a song I had previously not heard).  Turns out, I was right at the beginning of the show and proceeded to watch the remaining 50+ mins without changing the channel.

The colors, the energy, the atmosphere, and the band's amazing sound make this a must-have for my Blu-ray collection.  I caught the tail-end of this performance again the other night on Comcast, and I was still amazed by the performance for just those few minutes.  Royal Albert Hall in London looks like the perfect place to watch a concert, and it was the perfect place to host The Killers and the show they put on that night.

The CD accompanies the DVD version only.  The Blu-ray version only comes with the Blu-ray disc.  You do NOT get an audio CD.  Minus one star for leaving out the CD, which would have added less than $1 to the cost.  Boo.",1259539200,10,297,4.407407407407407
3972670,5,B002RBZ13Q,"I think this blu ray needs to be reviewed in two different capacities; quality of the disc, and quality of the concert.  Both are exceptional.  The picture and sound of the blu ray are outstanding. Vivid colors and boisterous music. You can almost feel the sweat flying at you (and these guys get sweaty).  This is really the next best thing to actually being at the concert (and maybe even better!). The other part is how good the show itself is.  I'm a huge Killers fan, and they played everything I really wanted to hear.  Even though it's a concert for the Day & Age album, they still played the best songs from all 3 other albums.  And played them they did.  It was an amazing show and they really put their hearts into. 5 stars!!",1259366400,,735,4.360294117647059
3972672,5,B002RBZ13Q,"We've seen them play two awesome shows live, but I think we had just as much fun watching this DVD at home.  The video clarity and color is stunning in 1080p and the DTS-HD audio is exceptional.  The energy and excitement of The Killers show translates beautifully.  This is definitely one of those experiences that makes you happy you upgraded your home theater setup to HD.

This BluRay is a bargain at $15....I don't understand how you can be upset you didn't get an audio CD as well.  I also picked up the CD/DVD version for $13, added the CD to my digital library, and payed it forward by giving the standard CD/DVD to a friend.  Add another Killers fan to the list.

$28 for a BluRay and Audio CD?  I'll take that deal every day.",1259020800,,735,4.352941176470588
3972673,5,B002RBZ13Q,"The Killers Live from Royal Albert Hall is pure rocking from start to finish. No fanciful sets or costume changes but Brandon Flowers and band mates are full of energy and the setlist is extremely tight, alternating between their big hits and eclectic tracks. Rock to Human, Somebody Told Me, Mr. Brightside, When You Were Young, Smile Like You Mean It and much more. At the end of it, you will find yourself exhausted, jumping and singing along with them, right in the comfort of your home.

The disc itself plays hi-def quality crystal clear on your HDTV and the sound is impeccable as you blast it through the speakers. And I must say whoever designed the interactive menu has created one of the best and most appealing navigation experience ever on a blu ray disc. Would have wished that they included all their videos to date as extras. Still, this is nothing less than the best! A+",1259020800,,887,4.613924050632911
3972686,5,B002RBZ13Q,"I'm a Killers fan therefor i would give this Blu ray a 5/5. But lets get to details,
This is an amazing concert with an amazing performance. This concert really show how good the Killers are at performing live, I'd say that its up there with Muse and Coldplay, probably no one can beat Muse, live wise, but the Killers are pretty darn good.

Minor Complaints:
The killers should really hire better audio engineers, Ive heard versions of Read my Mind live and it sounds a lot better then this DVD's version. Here is one really good recording i found, this is possibly one of the best recorded live performance of the Killers, [...]. I don't know whats going on,they should have more recordings, but nevertheless, i hope The Killers improve their live recordings in the future.

The Extras are good, with the HD Videos from festivals, but the over all depth was just ok, I would like to see more interviews with the band members and stuff like that. I wish people would stuff quality extras into these types of dvds instead of just shoving crap in it.

Oh, and there's no CD in the package, which is a bummer, though it wasn't really that bad cause i got the CD online (in the shady dark corner of the internet), Though i would of preferred having the lossless audio of a CD.

PAckaging wise, it was pretty lame, the Blu Ray itself didn't event have an artwork on it, it was just gray.

But overall, if ur a Killers Fan, then U NEED TO BUY THIS ON BLU RAY!!! It is just great! i had it in my 7.1 cranked up and it was just amazing. The Killers and their great music made up for everything that I complained above.",1258934400,,1611,4.338870431893688

The experience on this Blu Ray is as close you can get without actually buying tickets to see them. The sound quality and picture are great.

3972699,5,B002RBZ13Q,"The Killers: Live at the Royal Albert Hall is one of the best concert films I've ever seen. The Killers truly are one of the best live bands today, and this disc stands as a testament to that fact.

I first bought the CD/DVD package, and then, since I loved it so much, I decided to buy it on Blu-ray. Let me tell, the sound and video quality is incredible! If you watch it on your TV, and turn the volume up really loud, you almost feel like you there in the audience!

Spaceman, Human, I Can't Stay, All These Things That I've Done, Bling, and When You Were Young are my standout favorites, but each and every song they perform on this disc is amazing! All their best songs are on here!",1258070400,,688,4.165413533834586

The only downside, of course, is the lack of an audio CD to complement the Blu-Ray. This is unclear from the description of the product on this page and is the only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars.",1257984000,2,468,4.258426966292135

8378562,5,B002RBZ13Q,"I rated this 5 stars only because there isn't a 6-star option.

I have many concert DVDs, many that I think are outstanding (The Kings of Leon at the O2 is an example).  The Killers at Albert Hall has risen to the top.  I was overwhelmed on the first viewing and watched it again the next day - and had the same reaction.

I'm new to the Killers - mostly.  I knew their hits, but that was it.  I had no idea of the depth and variety of their music, and their ability to compel audiences in a live performance.  That ability shines through in this concert footage, and it makes you feel (almost) as if you are there.

Brandon Flowers (lead singer) connects with the audience in a way I've never seen before - and they with him.  It's as though they rehearsed together, the way the energy flows and they way they spontaneously play off one another.  The band is TOTALLY in a groove together - everyone is intensely driving off whatever vibe is underway.  It's the furthest from ""phoning it in"" that you can possibly get.

The sound, video, intro, outro, pacing . . . everything about this DVD is top notch.

Highly, highly recommended.",1516924800,,1133,4.389423076923077
