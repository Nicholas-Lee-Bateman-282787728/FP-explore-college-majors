2442616,5,B000BVM1TG,"Dallas Season 4 is another great season. I'm really looking forward to this DVD box set as season 4 has alot going on with very interesting and exciting plots and storylines. There's the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" resolution, two weddings, two timing, J.R. scheming against his brother to sabotage his deals when Bobby takes over Ewing Oil, Jock and wife Ellie feud against each other and their marriage almost ends in divorce, more intrigue when J.R. topples the  Asian government which confiscated his foreign oil wells, a revelation of Jock's fourth son much to J.R.'s dismay, Pam finally finds her real mother, plus a surprise but unwelcome visitor returns to Dallas towards the end of the season and gets her fatal comeuppance for crossing J.R.! It will also include as an extra the ""Dallas Reunion: Return to Southfork"" which aired in November 2004 when most of the original cast reunited.

I hope Warner release at least 3 seasons of Dallas per year so we Dallas fans can collect the complete series on DVD quickly. I can't wait for the gripping season 6 DVD with the great battle for Ewing Oil between J.R. and Bobby which ends with the Southfork fire cliffhanger and the brilliant season 7 DVD with J.R. being as nasty as ever which ends with the ""Who Shot Bobby?"" cliffhanger!",1130889600,14,1276,4.769230769230769
2442617,5,B000BVM1TG,"It is indeed exciting to see the new release so quickly, hopefully signaling this will continue since this show has 13 seasons and I'd like all of them soon.  The third season, which is what it reaally is, is one of the best years, with not only the revealing of who shot JR, which actually isn't as great as his shooting, but Ray finding out that he is the third son, the first season where Donna plays a major role, Lucy growing as a character as she marries Mitch, Jock ( in his final season before the death of Jim Davis) and Ellie having their stubborn attitudes almost ending their marriage, and good times for JR and Sue Ellen at the beginning of the year.  It stars all the original cast members for the last time together, including Barbare Bel Geddes, Jim Davis, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Larry Hagman, Steve Kanaly, Ken Kercheval, Victoria Principal, and Charlene Tilton.",1130544000,10,883,4.582278481012659

She really likes the old Dallas TV show and these DVDs play great. They're packaged well, have episode descriptions, good color and sound, and very readable subtitles in English that we appreciate because the big TV set we watch is an old RCA analog and doesn't have close-captioning. So far, I've purchased Seasons 3, 4 and 5 of Dallas from Amazon, in DVD, and they're just as great.

2442925,5,B000BVM1TG,What can I say; got this for my wife (she is watching them all from season 1 and up).  Amusing entertainment that is very period.  The lack of cell phones is almost funny since so much of the drama is dependent on that missed call or waiting for that important bit of information that only can be conveyed by telephone.

2442983,5,B000BVM1TG,"After a really unexpected-and shocking-cliffhanger of a season finale which left a major character hanging on for dear life, DALLAS returns with an all new season. And rest assured, your questions will be answered.

The fourth season of DALLAS continues right where season 3 left off, and it gets better with each episode. The burning question on everyone's mind is stretched out for a while (and wisely so, leaving ample room for more intricate guessing) before it is finally answered. After that, the double-dealing, wheeling and oh-so-delicious family drama at Southfork continues.

Here are some tidbits from what happens just to whet your appetites. Tune in to find out what happens.

There is a wedding...and no, I won't say who gets hitched. A paternity quest. A shocking discovery by Sue Ellen concerning a detective, and so much more. The writing, crisp and razor-sharp from the inception of the series, only gets better with each episode. The acting is also spot-on, as from the beginning of the show. Special mention must go to Victoria Principal, Linda Gray, Larry Hagman, Ken Kercheval and of course, Barbara Bel Geddes. They carried their emotional scenes very well, as did Jim Davis, Charlene Tilton and Steve Kanaly.

And even J.R. and Bobby get to direct. Another nifty surprise.

It all culminates in a season ending shocker that you will NEVER, EVER see coming.

This set jump-starts a very dramatic (as usual) season filled with more twists and turns that make the viewers scratch their heads and ask, ""Can life really be THIS complicated?"" This set puts Dallas on the map for good, and the show hits its prime here. J.R. is up to no good as usual, while Bobby is in the shadow of his brother, maintaining his composure most of the time.

2442990,4,B000BVM1TG,"**NOTE - This review contains spoilers**

Having originally aired during the 1980-81 TV season on CBS, this fourth season of ""Dallas"" was the series' peak in terms of viewership, grabbing a whopping 34 share and becoming the most-watched program of the season. (To put that in perspective, ""American Idol"" achieved a 17 share at its peak--half the viewers that ""Dallas"" pulled in this season).

Viewers had waited all summer long to find out the answer to the million-dollar question, ""Who Shot J.R.?"".

They actually had to wait a little longer as the assailant's identity would not be revealed for a few more episodes. Sue Ellen initially took the rap due to circumstantial evidence and she is jailed until she's bailed out anonymously. It is eventually revealed that her sister Kristin was the one who pulled the trigger, but she escapes incarceration by announcing she's carrying J.R.'s unborn child, so he pays her off and she flees to California. Unfortunately, this means my favorite female character disappears from the series.

After a series of ""bad romances"", Lucy finally lands hard-working and proud medical student Mitch Cooper and they marry at Southfork. To fill Mary Crosby's shoes, a new devious female arrives in the form of Mitch's sister Afton Cooper, played by Audrey Landers, who specialized in bitchy roles like this. Anne Francis (""Honey West"") shows up as her mother, Arliss. Lucy and Mitch are given a luxurious condominium as a wedding gift and later Lucy lands a job as a model with Pam's help. But the job does nothing but cause a rift in her marriage.

Pam gets a perm this season and locates her presumed-dead mother (Priscilla Pointer) while learning she can never give birth to a child. She and Bobby also encounter marriage problems due to his new job as President of Ewing Oil.

Having Bobby run the company takes a lot of the fun out of these episodes. J.R. spends the first half of the season in a wheelchair trying to gain back control of the company and it just isn't as much fun without him in the driver's seat. Once he gets his bearings back, he's wheeling and dealing like never before, and operating on an International level, trying to overthrow a foreign government and trying to put the moves on his new Public Relations advisor, Lesley Stewart (Susan Flannery of ""The Bold and the Beautiful""). I didn't care much for Flannery's portrayal. She's not necessarily written as a villainess, but her feline-like persona confuses the viewer into thinking she may be.

Donna Culver helps Bobby get elected to State Senate, much to the chagrin of Cliff Barnes, and later Donna and Ray Krebbs decide to marry. This after Ray discovers he is actually Jock's illegitimate son, from a WWII affair between Jock and Ray's mother, a nurse. It's great to see the good-natured Donna show her fangs a few times this season, especially when standing up to J.R.

When Miss Ellie discovers Jock has kept one too many secrets from her, and with the two of them on opposing sides of a land-development project, she ultimately seeks legal counsel for divorce.

Sue Ellen is now the doting mother to John Ross, and a chance meeting has her rekindling an old relationship with her college boyfriend (Monte Markham). But it's a different romantic entanglement that has her fleeing Southfork for good with her baby in the season finale. Season's end also features the welcome return of Mary Crosby and her entrance is a memorable one, filmed slowly from the feet up as she struts into the hotel lobby announcing her arrival. Her return is short-lived, as she turns up dead in the Ewing swimming pool shortly after threatening J.R.

Overall, another great season of ""Dallas"". I didn't like it as much as Season 3, but Audrey Landers is almost as interesting as Mary Crosby in the beautiful schemer role.

I must note that the music cues during the first half of the season were terrible; the same ominous piano chords played over and over. It got very dull and monotonous and added nothing to the show. Thankfully, there was a new score during the second half.

This set contains a great bonus feature in Return to Southfork, a 90 minute reunion that brings Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Victoria Principal, Charlene Tilton, Steve Kanaly, Ken Kercheval and Mary Crosby together again to reminisce. They answer viewer questions, count down the Top Ten ""Dallas"" cliffhangers as voted by fans, and show bloopers and gag reels never seen before. Everyone looks good but Linda Gray and Mary Crosby seem to have aged the best.

The discs are once again dual-sided, the picture quality varies from bright and clear, to very grainy, and the audio is very low.

Most fans would consider this the ultimate season of ""Dallas"" due to the ""Who Shot J.R"" frenzy. 4 out of 5 stars.",1299369600,2,4796,4.825822168087698
2442991,5,B000BVM1TG,"""Dallas"" became television's #1 rated series in the fall of 1980 with the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" story as millions, not only in the United States, but worldwide, wathched to see who the guilty culprit was. Due to a writer's strike during the summer of 1980 ""Dallas"" didn't have it's season premiere until November 7, 1980. It wasn't until the fourth episode, airing on November 21st, entitled ""Who Done It"", that viewers discovered who pulled the trigger. That episode, to this very day, holds the record as being the highest rated dramatic hour in the history of broadcast television with a 53.3 rating and a 76% share of the audience tuned in. This season, like all others, also has a great cliffhanger that aired on May 1, 1981 where Cliff Barnes discovers a dead woman in J.R.'s pool.

 This four-disc set includes all 23 season four episodes along with the bonus feature called ""Dallas Reunion: The Return To Southfork"" which aired on CBS in 2004.

 Unlike other primetime soaps from the eighties like ""Dynasty"", ""Dallas"" has all its 14 seasons available on DVD.",1290729600,,1061,4.813186813186813
2443002,4,B000BVM1TG,"I found the second half of this season to dissapointing and dull. The first half moves along smoothly enough but then appears to get bogged down in the middle with everyone's marital problems.

The Mitch and Lucy story seems repetitious as Lucy, again, gets engaged and in this case married. Mitch is little more mature than Lucy's other men, but he actually seems more like a big brother than husband. The quote from J.R. regarding her luck with men is classic: ""Lose another one Sugar? Got to hand it to you you sure can pick them. A pansy, a crook and a pauper.""

Mitch appears to be deadly serious about himself while Lucy giggles like a lovesick teenager. The slowness of the storylines beomes apparent as Mitch and Lucy remain married (seperated) until next season when both finally decide mutually to call it quits. Possibly this gave a more dramatic side to Lucy.

The Takapa storyline is best summarized by one of the brothers (I forget which) - ""Don't tell me momma and daddy are fighting over some swamp land?"" Unfortunately yes and it's every bit as interesting as that.

The senator Ewing story is boring as Senator Ewing does absolutely nothing once elected.

The Leslie Stewart storyline is a really a bad joke as though anyone would believe that JR Ewing has changed his ways all because of a lame advertising campaign.

The ridiculous story line about the Asian oil wells and the revolution which is basically just JR trying to undo everything he did last year because the cartel won't do any business with him. As Cliff says, ""Nobody's that lucky - not even you, JR.""

The return of Kristen is also not a big deal either. She got away with attempted murder last year so it's kind of pushing things a little to think she would return to extort more money.

On the positive side I like the addition of Rebecca Wentworth and Dusty's return was welcome if not a little far fetched. Also, the addition of Donna Culver was welcome as woman who actually did something besides sleep around. Take notes, Lucy!

The addition of Afton Cooper is tolerable if you can get past Audrey Landers' singing. She can carry a tune but the story of JR bankroling her career recalls the ""Triangle"" episode and JR's contract with Garnett MdGee which incuded fringe benefits. Publicist Leslie Stewart reccomends to JR that he not waste his time on ""second rate lounge singers."" How about second rate PR women?

The cliffhanger seems as if it were just tacked on at the end of the season. Kristen is now an outcast and therefore expendable and make everybody wait until next year to find out the pay off. Her return seems unrealted to everything else that's happened since she ws sent packing to California.

Entertaining in places it but shows signs of weakening. The cast recalls in interviews on season 3 dvd that they already knew that they would never top ""A House Divided"" - I can't even stomach the sounds of anyone asking ""Who Shot JR?"" It shows here that it was going to be a hard season to follow. It was probably never to be topped atleast not in the ratings.

The reunion special is almost worth the price of admission, as the cast of Dallas seems to have fun lampooning their own show. A countdown of fan's top ten favorite cliffhangers is also noteworthy. Bet you can't guess whcih is number one? The cast reminicses about the show, pay tributes to Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes (hospitlaized at the time) and recall the infamous cliffhanger and the hype surrounding it. Also includes a blooper segment and gag reel of practidal jokes. There is some comfort in knowing that the cast had a sense of humor about this.",1287187200,3,3624,4.636505460218409

2443005,5,B000BVM1TG,"This is the fourth season's worth (#3 in original broadcast, but Warner calls it #4 for DVD release) of ""Dallas,"" CBS' classic prime serial, from 1980-81. In this season, the mystery of J.R.'s shooting is solved, Lucy gets married, Ray is revealed to be the illegitimate son of Jock (and, as such, a Ewing), Ray also gets married, and J.R. runs a counterrevolution, among other things. It all builds up to a head when Cliff finds a dead body in the Southfork pool, and accuses J.R. of the crime (a reasonable accusation, given J.R.'s character)-- but who is the dead person that Cliff finds? Fans will have to get the #5 release to find that out.

As for the technical aspects, the video is generally the same quality as it was in #3-- very good, but with quite a few dust specks and bits of dirt, especially in the opening titles of each episode. The audio carries the stories across extremely well, just like it did in #3.

As for packaging, the box is slimmed down even more from the #3 release, given the fact that the season didn't start until Nov. 1980. There are 4 double-sided discs containing the 23 episodes from Nov. 1980 to May 1981. The episode listings are on two of the inside flaps, but because of the slimmed-down box, there are no plot listings. All that is included is the episode titles, writer and director credits, and airdates. There are 3 outings on each side of each disc, except for disc 4-- on that one, there are 3 outings on the front, but only 2 on the back, not only because these were the last outings of the season, but also to make room for the bonus feature. The discs are packaged on top of each other in two trays. The package is in a purplish color scheme.

As for bonuses, there are no commentaries, but to make up for that absence, what is included is the `04 CBS ""Dallas"" reunion special called ""The Return to Southfork."" Here, seven of the major cast members (led by, first and foremost, Larry Hagman as J.R.) and one minor member (Mary Crosby, as ""Kristin"") reminisce on the phenomenon that was ""Dallas."" Among the highlights were the results of an online poll asking the question to viewers of their opinions of the best cliffhangers of the series' long run (before each of several commercial breaks, seven of the results would be revealed, each by one of the seven major cast members, and at the end, the final three would be revealed), plus home movies, bloopers, and a fan Q&A segment with all eight of the cast members at the Oil Baron's Ballroom. This special was 2 hrs. in original broadcast, but has been edited down to 87 min. for DVD release. The opening titles of the special paid homage to the classic opening titles of the series itself-- a shot of the skyline, alternating rural and urban views, and cast introductions. The cast introductions for this special (which paid homage to the three-way split-screens) involved present-day shots of the major cast members, flanked on each side by classic shots from the series.

As for languages and subtitles, those options are just like those of #3, with English audio, and English, French, and Spanish subtitles (no subtitles on the Reunion special, though).

Overall, this, like #3, is a well-made release of the fourth season's worth (actually, the third full season's worth) of CBS' classic prime serial, and like #3, comes highly recommended for content and presentation.

By the way, I forgot to mention that famed actor Jim Davis (who played Jock from 1978 to 1981) died 4/26/81 at 71 of a gastric ulcer. He passed on just prior to the end-of-season cliffhanger, ""Ewing-Gate.""",1233360000,,3584,4.654028436018957

2443023,4,B000BVM1TG,"Okay, so without a doubt, the biggest moment in season four of the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas was the revelation of who really shot oil big wig JR Ewing (Larry Hagman) in television's ultimate cliffhanger at the end of the third season.

The shooter is revealed in the fourth episode of the season, and that episode ranked as one of the most watched episodes of any series in television history. I won't spoil the surprise if there are still one or two people who don't know and don't want to know who pulled the trigger, but the writers and actors and everyone did a great job of making sure that viewers were led down many paths and had many choices as to who it was that pulled the trigger.

The fourth season began immediately after JR was shot and continued through some tumultuos times for the oil-rich Ewing family. As the previous season ended, JR's brother Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and his wife Pamela (Victoria Principal) were leaving the family's ranch, Southfork, heading for a new life in California. They were tired of JR's shady dealings and packed up and left, much to the dismay of matriarch Miss Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes).

JR's shooting brings Pamela and Bobby back to Southfork, where Bobby takes over as temporary boss at Ewing Oil. As JR recovers, he finds ways to sneak back into power, finally leading to Bobby stepping down and JR resuming his ""rightful"" spot at the head of the company. However, Bobby's leadership helped the company break new ground and for that, he earned his father Jock's (Jim Davis) respect. Of course running Ewing Oil quickly taxed Bobby's marriage and sent his wife towards the arms of another man. Pam, back at her former job at a department store, finds it hard to resist the urge to cheat on her husband with a magazine editor she works with.

JR and his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) have more marital problems of their own, as she is a prime suspect in his shooting and eventually finds herself in the arms of a few different men, including her former college sweetheart Clint Ogden. While Sue Ellen finds herself dedicated to motherhood, she doesn't find herself dedicated to JR, as his continued relationships with other women drive her over the edge. JR's most prolific affairs in this season are with his niece Lucy's sister-in-law Afton Cooper (guest star Audrey Flanders) and with PR maven Leslie Stewart (Susan Flannery, now of The Bold and the Beautiful). As the season draws to a close, Sue Ellen is reunited with Dusty Farlow, (guest star Jared Martin) a man she fell in love with in an earlier season and was presumed dead in a helicopter crash. She makes plans to take her baby and leave JR for the Farlow's Southern Cross Ranch, with a little help from Pamela.

Miss Ellie and Jock go through a tough time when they are on opposing sides of a development deal. When it is revealed that ranch foreman Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly) is Jock's son from an affair he had during the war, Miss Ellie believes that her husband begins to favor Ray a little more. The Takapa development deal widens the gap between the heads of the Ewing family before Bobby, who was elected a state senator in a special election, works out a compromise that suits both. After Miss Ellie and Jock make up, they head to Paris for a second honeymoon.

Ray also reconnects with the love of his life, Donna Culver (guest star and future series regular Susan Howard). They get married, much to the dismay of Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), the brother of Pamela, who is the arch-rival to the Ewing family. Cliff and Donna had been dating for a while as he ran her son's campaign.

Cliff and Pamela also track down their mother, or really, Pamela tracks her down and Cliff gets mad. Rebecca Barnes Wentworth (guest star Priscilla Pointer) moves to Dallas to try to get closer to the family she left many years earlier. Though Cliff rebuffs her attempts of reconciliation at first, he is later swayed to reconcile with his mother.

Young Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) meets Mitch Cooper (guest star Leigh McCloskey) at college and the two get married, despite the fact that he is struggling to make ends meet. He resents the Ewing money and he and Lucy have many arguments over that. Lucy gets a modeling job thanks to Pamela's editor friend and that furthers the divide between the two and as the season ends, Lucy is heading back to Southfork.

The cliffhanger end to season four once again involved JR. Cliff showed up at Southfork for a meeting with Bobby, who he had been working with in the senate. He arrives and finds a body in the pool. He dives in, notices the (still unrevealed) body is dead. Looking up, he sees a broken railing and JR standing looking down over the pool.

The extra on this set was a pretty decent look into the show, a 2004 reunion entitled Return to Southfork, hosted by Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Victoria Principal, Ken Kercheval, Steve Kanaly and Charlene Tilton. The original stars talk about life on the set, the famous cliffhangers and more. I found this an interesting piece, as I never watched the show when it was on the air and have yet to see many of the famous scenes.

Sadly, this season marked the last appearance of Jim Davis as Jock Ewing. Though his character would continue on in the next season (on a trip to South America), the actor died before the shooting began. Davis was fantastic as the family patriarch and it is hard to imagine the series carrying on without him, though it did for another 10 years.

All in all, if you're looking for soapy drama in a true 80s fashion, you really can't go wrong with Dallas: Season Four.",1176076800,3,5631,4.614385614385615

What I didn't like is the double layer discs that can be easily damaged if handled improperly by other people.

2443027,4,B000BVM1TG,"I own the other three seasons, so naturally was keen to grab Season 4.  I had only seen some of this season when it was first shown in 1981 on TV.

However, watching it in its entirety on DVD recently, I have found Season 4 to be lacking the overall spark of the wonderful Season 3.  OK granted, the anticipation of finding out who JR's killer is helped give this season its appeal back in 1981.  Yet, once that storyline is resolved, the rest of the season does not have enough excitement to really pull the viewer in.  The very weak union of Mitch and Lucy dominated, as did the introduction of Susan Flannery as Leslie Stewart (JR's PR Assistant). This added very little value in my opinion.  Overall, nothing spectacular seemed to unfold unless you think the Tapaka storyline is a big deal.  It's only near the end of the season when a hint of things to come in the next season came to light.  The possible divorce of Sue Ellen and JR and the 'kidnapping' of John Ross JR.  Also the continued attempts of Bobby and Pamela to conceive a child.  Poor Pammy.

The biggest appeal of Season 4 is the inclusion of the special feature: Return to Southfork ... this is quite entertaining. One thing I would like to add about Dallas is the problem throughout with poor casting. For example, Charlene Tilton as Lucy and the ever present Ken Kerchival as Cliff Barnes.  These two characters,along with the actor who plays Ray Crabbs receive too much exposure in this show despite not being main characters.  That always surprised me.

Nevertheless, I look forward to Season 5 after feeling quite let down by the 'boring' Season 4.",1149206400,4,1623,4.551724137931035
2443028,5,B000BVM1TG,"Nominated for 18 Emmys and 15 Golden Globes in its thirteen season run, Dallas is the epitome of the prime-time drama/soap opera genre. Premiering in 1978 as a five part mini-series, the show combines the usual sex and innuendo of classic afternoon soap operas with the freewheeling adventure of Texas wildcats and filthy rich capitalist oil barons. The combination of business dealings and rampant affairs tested well with both the male and female demographic, prompting CBS to make Dallas a regular part of its prime-time lineup. The result was one of the most successful television shows in history. In fact, the so-called `Who shot J.R.?"" episode (""A House Divided"" Air Date: 3-21-1980) still reigns as the second most watched TV show in history (the season finale of MASH is #1). With one of most memorable characters ever created (the man everyone loves to hate), it's no surprise that Dallas held the #1 or #2 spot in the Nielsen ratings for most of the 1980s...

Dallas spent most of its television life in the Friday night time slot following the successful CBS series, The Dukes Of Hazzard. Creator David Jacobs originally intended to create a series around a poor Texas girl, Pam Barnes (Victoria Principal), who marries into a wealthy family (The Ewings) with whom her family has been feuding for decades. The first five episodes mostly center around the family discord faced by Pam and her husband Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) as they attempt to bring their families to a truce. But it soon became apparent to producers of the show that Bobby's scoundrel of a brother, Ewing Oil President J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), would be the true star of the show. Son of Ewing Oil founder Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and his wife Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), J.R. sought to make Ewing Oil the largest independent oil company in the world, and he intended to go to any lengths necessary to get what he wanted. And as you'll see, sooner or later, J.R. always gets what he wants... Along the way, he butts heads with life-long rival Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), drives his own wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to alcoholism, and even mortgages the beloved Southfork Ranch (Miss Ellie's childhood home and current residence for the majority of the Ewing clan). Southfork foreman Ray Krebs (Steve Kanaly) and Ewing grandchild Lucy (Charlene Tilton) add flavorful subplots to a series often dominated by J.R.'s nefarious schemes. In short, Dallas offers its viewers everything - money, sex, violence, conspiracy, intricate business dealings, etc. If you haven't seen it, then immediately start watching from the beginning episodes of the first season. You won't be disappointed...!

The Dallas (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""No More Mister Nice Guy"" in which the shooting of J.R. forces Bobby to temporarily take over Ewing Oil while his older brother recovers. The promotion slowly changes Bobby into the vindictive brother he always loathed. Meanwhile, Sue Ellen wonders if she shot J.R. herself while mired in the foggy haze of a drinking binge... Other notable episodes include ""Start the Revolution with Me"" in which J.R. attempts to orchestrate a counter-revolution in order to regain the Ewing's Asian oil wells that were nationalized shortly before his shooting, and the season finale ""Ewing-Gate"" in which J.R.'s underhanded dealings in the Asian oil deals threaten to bring down all of Ewing Oil...

2443029,5,B000BVM1TG,"I've just watched the first six episodes of ""Dallas: Season 4,"" and I'm looking forward to catching a few more episodes each day after work!  This prime time soap is so addictive!  The acting and the story lines are so entertaining, that by the time you've watched one, you go ahead and let the next one play!  This season has so much going on: The mystery of ""who shot JR"" is solved, Pam's search for her mother, Bobby becoming president of Ewing Oil, JR doing his usual scheming to undo Bobby's control, and Lucy's new romance with a pre-med college student, all this in just the first six episodes!  I've been searching the net for any news of a release date for ""Dallas: Season 5,"" but have been unable to find any.  I know that by the time I watch the final episode of this season, with Cliff Barnes discovering the floating body of a woman in the swimming pool at SouthFork, and JR looking down from the upstairs balcony, I'll definitely want to see Season 5!  I grew up watching Dallas, along with ""Knots Landing,"" and ""Falcon Crest,"" in the `80's, but I didn't fully appreciate their entertainment value as much as I do now.  I can hardly believe that a full six seasons of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" have already been released (and in a very short time!), but only four seasons of ""Dallas!""

2443041,5,B000BVM1TG,"... but that's an argument for another time.

Season 4 of 'Dallas' continues apace, and, to directly contradict the spotlight review above, is most certainly the equal of, and in many places, surpasses the very high standards set down in Season 3.

Okay, so we all know who shot J.R. I won't spoil it for the two-and-a-half people left on the planet who do not know, but with the first four episodes done and dusted, there's a wealth of new situations and characters and mishaps waiting to be introduced to the unhappiest family in Texas.

New sons, new mothers and new (and old!) wives are just for starters: Season 4 also brings us resurrections, infidelities, engineered foreign revolutions, oil terrorism, murders and more high-octane drama than you can shake an oily stick at. The more standout recurring characters come in the shape of Susan Howard as Donna Culver and Leigh McCloskey as Mitch Cooper (the whiniest chauvanist since... ...ever!), and the resident cast is every bit as watchable and lovable as before.

While Season 4 of 'Dallas' does contain much of the previous high standards of writing and acting, there's a decidedly more 'soapy' air on show - although nowhere as outlandish as 'Dynasty', there are certain situations, such as the rapid deterioration of Bobby and Pam's marriage, or the reintroduction of one of Sue Ellen's old flames, that hint at the beginnings of that gloriously escapist behemoth known as 80's Prime Time. Still, it's a very subtle shift, and this isn't a complaint; rather, the Ewings are changing for the better.

All in all, Season 4 of Dallas is truly excellent. In addition, audio/visual quality is, as ever, top-notch, and the extra 'Return to Southfork' documentary, though obviously and painfully scripted, is a nice touch - particularly to see just how extraordinarily well Miss Linda Grey has aged!

Highly recommended, now PLEASE won't y'all release the rest of the show??",1143244800,16,1930,4.996884735202492

2443046,4,B000BVM1TG,"Thus far, ""Dallas"" just gets better with each season. The focus seems to be on Sue Ellen more than any character but each has his or her time in the spotlight. This season featured a conflict between Jock and Miss Ellie, Pamela's search for her mother and a career change for Bobby. Plot wise and writing wise, this show is great, five stars.

I thought the DVD quality was actually rather good. The picture is clear, the audio is also rather good.

My only complaint about this set is perhaps the shift in design of the box and the lack of real good extra features. I think it's great that the CBS ""Dallas"" reunion is the main extra for this set. Yet, why include it on this early season set? This special is great but it spoils the later seasons and plot twists. Yes, there may be many who are already aware of what's going to happen but for those few of us who are using these DVD sets to actually get into the series, it's sort of a ""why did they put that in here?"" feeling.

I like the slimmer box, but, I sort of miss the booklet that came with the previous sets that gave you a mini synopsis of each episode. That's not in this set. Instead, the episodes are listed on the flaps with just a little information regarding the director and such of each episode.

Otherwise, this is, again, a must have DVD set. It's great, quality television with good plots and great actors. I'd definately recommend it to anyone looking to get their money's worth.",1140220800,7,1453,4.350553505535055
2443047,4,B000BVM1TG,"Though the double-sided disc format of this collection remains unpopular to this reviewer, ""Dallas-the Complete Fourth Season"" remains a favorite.  It's the season that resolved the ""Who Shot JR?"" question, reveals a fourth Ewing son, marries off two of the cast members, and marks the last appearance of one of the most popular.  And perennial ""underdog"" Cliff Barnes continues getting the shaft.

It also introduced (or re-introduced) characters that would feature prominently in the series' present and future story lines: Donna Culver (Susan Howard), Afton Cooper (Audrey Landers), Clayton Farlow (legendary song and dance man Howard Keel), Rebecca Wentorth (Priscilla Pointer) and the ever-popular Dusty (Jared Martin).

Other prominent guests include Craig Stevens (TV's former ""Peter Gunn""), William Windom, Leigh McCloskey, Anne Francis (""Honey West"" of the cult television show) and Barbara Babcock (memorable later on ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"").

Also, Susan Flannery (several pounds lighter than her present days as the matriarch on the soap ""The Bold and the Beautiful"") makes a worthy equal to J.R. while William Smithers is sublimely sinister as the crafty ""Jeremy Wendell"".

And, speaking of Larry Hagman, the actor gets to continue his chewing of scenery in a role that only he could play...deliciously.",1138406400,12,1345,5.568627450980392
2443048,5,B000BVM1TG,"Season Four of the sinfully-good CBS-TV nighttime, prime-time soap opera ""Dallas"" came out on DVD on January 24th, 2006, in a nice-looking 4-Disc set, which contains all 23 full-length, fourth-year episodes (running about 49 minutes each).

This set, as most Dallas fans surely realize, has within it the episode that resolves the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" story arc. It's episode #4 of this season (""Who Done It?""), which first aired on Friday night, November 21st, 1980. And it looks just great on this DVD (as do all the other episodes as well). The video quality here, like the earlier DVD sets of ""Dallas"" put out by Warner Home Video, looks A-OK to me.

Prior to the much-anticipated airing of ""Who Done It?"" in late November of 1980 (which was delayed in getting aired by about two months due to an actors' strike in Hollywood that shut down production of all TV series), it had been exactly eight months since TV viewers had seen the season-ending cliffhanger where we see J.R. Ewing being filled with hot lead from the gun of an unseen and unknown would-be murderer.

That meant eight long months of guesswork engaged in by fans of the series, trying to figure out who plugged John Ross Ewing II. I can vividly recall the media build-up to the ""Who Done It?"" episode in 1980. It was something else. Everyone was talking ""Dallas"" and speculating as to who might have been the gunman (or gunwoman). And there wasn't a shortage of ""suspects"" either, right on up to Miss Ellie Ewing, J.R.'s own mother! Several people thought Ellie had had enough of her eldest son's backstabbing shenanigans and had decided to take matters (and a murder weapon) into her own hands.

Anyway, those months leading up to the big cliffhanger-resolution 4th show of the year were truly something to behold. So it's no wonder that the ""Who Done It?"" episode managed to break all kinds of television records. 41,470,000  homes (""households"") were tuned to ""Dallas"" that Friday night in 1980 to see who it was that tried to kill Mr. Ewing, shattering the previous television ratings' record (held at that time by the last episode of ""The Fugitive"" in 1967) for the highest-rated and most-watched single TV program in history.*

* = Total number of actual ""viewers"" watching ""Dallas"" on 11/21/1980, however, was much higher than the 41-Million-plus figure previously mentioned. From data I've gathered on the Internet, there were approximately 83,000,000 people watching ""Dallas"" that night in the United States. (Although some sources list this ""Total Number Of People Watching"" stat as greater than 90-Million.)

Another interesting statistic that surrounds the airing of the ""Who Done It?"" episode is the fact that commercial advertisements that were seen on CBS-TV that night cost those sponsors $500,000 per minute. And, remember, that was many, many years ago, in 1980. Whew! J.R. would no doubt be very proud of those monetary stats!

Of course, that half-a-million-dollars-per-minute TV ad cost, circa 1980, is dwarfed by some similar 21st-century stats....e.g., the average cost for a 30-second TV spot during the annual Super Bowl telecast reached a staggering $2.4-Million (as of 2005).

This fourth year of ""Dallas"", which is considered by many loyal ""Dallas"" fans to really be just the third (full) season of the show, in addition to containing some of the most-memorable episodes from the whole series, also marks the sad departure of Jim Davis (who played ""Jock Ewing"", the always-gruff and no-nonsense head of the Ewing family and Ewing Oil empire).

Jim Davis died at the age of 71 on April 26, 1981, which was just days before this fourth-season's cliffhanging finale (""Ewing-Gate"") was aired on CBS. Jim's/Jock's presence was indeed missed by this writer during the subsequent seasons of ""Dallas"". And while the character of ""Clayton Farlow"" (played by the late Howard Keel) was a pretty good character in his own right, there was just no replacing Jock Ewing. Couldn't be done.

As fate would have it, Keel passed away on the exact day that the ""Dallas Reunion"" special originally aired on network TV in early November 2004. He was 85 years old. That very Reunion special is also included in its entirety in this DVD set.

This DVD aggregation contains four double-sided discs, which are held in two overlapping disc trays within a smaller and more-compact Digipak case than was used for the two earlier DVD collections. The footprint (spine width) of this 4th-season pack is a mere 3/4 of an inch.

When all four discs are removed from the two DVD-holding compartments, an impressive-looking underlying image emerges beneath the plastic trays -- a picture of a ""smoking gun"". A nice packaging touch.

There is no booklet included here in the Season-Four set. And the slimmer packaging reduces the amount of room for episode info...so there are no detailed (or even non-detailed) episode descriptions to be found on the innards of the box. The episode titles and airdates are listed however.

The outer slipcase box features photos of three of the main cast members (J.R., Pam, and Bobby), with the Dallas city skyline in the background. And while these three pics on the front cover are cut-and-paste jobs, I think the cover looks very nice.

And I just love the humorous blurb on the back of the outer box here too. A portion of it reads -- ""Who shot J.R.? One of the men he cheated in business? One of the women he cheated in love? Or is the culprit closer to home: a member of the big, unhappy Ewing family who figured to reduce the weasel population of Texas by one?""

Excellent! That packaging verbiage deserves a big ol' ""LOL"" too! :-)

Bonus Feature:

There are no Audio Commentaries included here, but the folks at Warner Home Video have included a really nice extra bonus item on Side B of Disc #4 of this set -- ""Dallas Reunion: The Return To Southfork"".

First seen on CBS on November 7th, 2004, this 2-hour Reunion special (87 minutes on the DVD, without the original commercials) was watched by more than 9-Million people during its initial airing. It ranked an impressive #20 in the Nielsen ratings for that week.

The Reunion Special is a very fun program to watch, with many original ""Dallas"" cast members (including Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, and Victoria Principal) getting together at the real ""Southfork"" Ranch in Texas to share their individual and collective remembrances of the TV series (which ended its remarkable 357-episode network run in 1991).

The ""Reunion"" is filled with cast-member anecdotes, bloopers, behind-the-scenes footage, and more good stuff too. A nifty little section of the Reunion program centers its attention on the ""Best Dallas Cliffhangers"". And there's some interesting unaired footage that was filmed during the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" frenzy, which includes scenes of various ""suspects"" firing the famous shot heard 'round the TV world.

Some of the outtake/blooper footage is hilarious. I especially like the outtake which has a frustrated Barbara Bel Geddes (""Miss Ellie"") unleashing an unmentionable invective as she blows a line of dialogue. The curse word has been ""bleeped out"" by the CBS censors, but it's still funny anyhow, because you know Barbara uttered something naughty. :)

All-in-all, this Dallas Reunion is a very pleasant and enjoyable look back at one of TV's pioneering ""nighttime soaps"", a show that entered American living rooms for 14 consecutive years, spanning parts of three separate decades.

Some Season-Four DVD Specs:

VIDEO -- These 23 episodes are displayed in their native Full-Frame ratio (1.33:1), as first aired in 1980-1981. The 2004 Reunion special is also presented in 1.33:1 Full-Frame, as originally seen.

AUDIO -- Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono for all episodes (English only). The Retrospective Documentary includes a DD 2.0 Stereo soundtrack.

SUBTITLES -- In English, French, and Spanish. No subtitles are provided for the Reunion special though.

CHAPTERS? -- Yes. Each episode is divided into 6 chapters, and the originally-aired ""previews"" are intact prior to the main titles on all episodes. The ""Next Week On Dallas"" trailers at the end of each show are not included, however. (Note: The Reunion special is not broken up into individual chapters.)

MENUS -- The S.4 Menus are just like those from the earlier ""Dallas"" sets, featuring the main-title theme music playing on a continuous loop while the Main Menu is on screen. Sub-Menus can be accessed for ""Episodes"", ""Languages"", and ""Special Features"". Plus, there's a ""Play"" option on the Main Menu too. Selecting that item will ""Play All"" of the three episodes on that side of the disc without interruption. (There are just two episodes on the ""B"" side of the last disc, however -- plus the lengthy Reunion documentary.)

The Main Menu on each disc and side features a picture of the Ewing family....although Jock isn't in the picture. I can't figure out the reason for this blatant omission, because Jock was still in the cast during this season. Donna, Ray, and Cliff are shown on the Main Menu, but not Jock. That's a shame, too, because Jock should certainly be included in a ""family"" type portrait (circa Season 4; '80-'81).

------------------

This Season-Four DVD collection of ""Dallas"" is an essential purchase for those who already have Season #3. I cannot imagine having one without the other. Those two ""Dallas"" seasons go together like hand-and-glove.

To be able to own the forever-popular ""Who Done It?"" episode (and the eps. that lead up to it) in a beautiful, digitally-preserved format, as we see here, for a very reasonable price tag, is something that virtually all ""Dallas"" fans should be happy about.

And, on top of that, with a feature-length documentary program tacked on to this DVD set as a bonus, it makes ""Dallas: The Complete Fourth Season"" an even better 'steal of a deal'. I'm not too sure that even the scheming J.R. Ewing himself could have wangled a better deal for this DVD package. ;)",1138147200,26,9967,4.983734939759036

2443050,5,B000BVM1TG,"The 4th Season of Dallas was a great season and was another Number One Rated series for that year agian ! It Includes 23 Great Episodes including some really well known ones ,Dont have to explain everything about Dallas because we know what a great and addictive show it is. But when i recieved the Boxset i though we would get The same type of box like Season 3 But i was REALLY WRONG we got a slim box which inside has 2 discs on one Side and 2 on the other the thing is very small too , what i don't understand is they cant just produce 6 (1 sided) DVD's , i mean to make the set which alot of people do buy a little nicer and even if they had to put up the price like 5 Dollars , so really the set was a dissapointment  BUT DEFENITLY NOT THE CONTENT because Dallas is one of the best Tv shows ever Also The Complete 5th Season DVD will be released around Spring of 2006 , which is a very fast Release Date. Also if you did not know Knots Landing The 1st Season will be released on DVD on March 28th 2006 ! Dont miss either show on DVD because they have some of the greatest moments on tv. Both are excellent in every way
