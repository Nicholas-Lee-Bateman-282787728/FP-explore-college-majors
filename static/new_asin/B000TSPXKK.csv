I was greeted by my father then walked through a beautiful patio bursting with colorful flowers and tropical plants to the Fred Harvey coffee shop where my stepmother was having her Sunday morning coffee. I had already sampled delicious Fred Harvey meals in the Hi-Level dining car.

I enjoyed this fantasy trip on the Super Chief I never got a chance to ride, but I agree with M Fusco. This dvd features way too much talking and not enough action though I love the chef's comments which seem more spontaneous and real. I am taking a cue from M and fast-forwarding through the comments.

The busy dvd cover with those UGLY freight diesels is also a turn-off because it lacks that famous Super Chief ""Style"".

I am also waiting for a cheaper copy of the Super Chief DVD produced by Sunday River.",1403654400,,915,4.434523809523809

This video will give you a peek into the into the lives of those who road and ran the Super Chief. From the excitement of  children on their first ride, to the heads of AT&SF. Using interviews and historic footage it's the best video of Santa Fe's premier train, I have viewed.",1368057600,,369,4.3478260869565215
