3841324,5,B0021R52IA,"One reviewer gave this DVD only one star claiming that it was all repeat material which is just not true. The Exhale Core Fusion practice is one style of workout - so all are similar in that it is the same discipline. Just like all Kundalini yoga practices are similar in style or all Pilates programs are similar in style. However, this DVD in particular focuses on the lower body - thighs and glutes. The other two Core Fusion DVDs focus on the whole body. So, if you liked ""Body Sculpt"" or ""Pilates Plus"" then you can be sure you'll love ""Thighs & Glutes.""",1250121600,33,559,4.384615384615385
3841325,1,B0021R52IA,"If you have either of the other two Core videos, don't waste your money on this one!  With the exeption of one 10-minute segment, the exercises here can all be found in Core Pilates or Core Body Sculpt.  If I hadn't opened the package, I would have sent this one back for a refund.",1249171200,33,281,4.185185185185185
3841326,5,B0021R52IA,"I just did Exhale: Core Fusion Thighs & Glutes, and I CAN FEEL my muscles!

I am a fan of original Callanetics, and was looking for other programs in similar lines but more modern and more strenuous then Callanetics. Core Fusion Thighs & Glutes turned out to be exactly what I was looking for for lower body! (no abs though) I was not fond of the setting with a statue of Buddha in the background, shadows of trees on curtains, and darker color scheme overall. However, I appreciate the fact that I could get to the menu and start exercising without being forced to wait through a lengthy intro. Exercises are well organized into 10 minute segments of 5 segments total with clear instructions. One instructor demonstrates advanced version, while the other demonstrates lighter version of the same exercise. The music selection is fine, and not distracting. Most importantly the exercises are great!!!",1248825600,74,900,4.882352941176471
3841347,5,B0021R52IA,"My legs are so Sore I can feel them as I walk!  First let me say that I work out five times a week doing various types of workouts. I do Cathe Friedrich, Kelly Coffey Meyer, Linda Wooldridge and Jari Love to name a few. I also go yoga and Pilates and I'm November I started Exhale Core Fusion. I started with Pilates Plus and it was tough but not as tough as this! Thighs and Glutes takes it to a whole new level. Fred and Rluzabeth work literally every muscle and at first you might not think you're doing much but the next day Wham! This is permanent my rotation because I'm going to have great results. I highly recommend this workout!",1482796800,6,638,4.186991869918699
3841348,3,B0021R52IA,"This definitely leaves me shaking after a work out, but the 10 minute intervals makes it mentally easy to get through. It feels good. My only complaint is that I find it hard to follow along. Sometimes the camera angles are positioned poorly so I can't tell what the instructors are doing, and they don't explain clearly either. Some moves feel way to easy when they should be hard, so I know I'm doing it wrong cause I'm definitely not a strong or flexible person. It got frustrating a few times.",1482278400,,497,4.472527472527473

3841361,4,B0021R52IA,"Even though this got good reviews, I was a little skeptical. I am used to weight training/bootcamp workouts. This is something completely different, and the more I do it, the more I like it. It's great for targeting, which is what I wanted. And, it's nice to do something different that isn't high impact. There are no weights, just a lot of reps and very small movements. After three weeks, I have noticed a difference in my legs. The format is also nice, with 5 10 minute segments. So, sometimes i just do a couple of sections as part of my regular workout. It's a nice option. I am going to order more of this series to mix in with the higher impact things I do.",1461283200,,665,4.285714285714286

3841363,3,B0021R52IA,I have many different 10 min segmented workout version dvds. This one is just ok. I suggest trying out the different 5-10 min youtube videos out there that target glutes/thighs. Nothing new here or different in terms of workouts; same standing/floor leg extention routine using a chair/counter. Full disclosure: I paid almost $10 for this dvd recently & it's half price now but would not buy at either price because it's just ok/rehash.,1456099200,,436,4.986301369863014

I'm not watching this for titillation, but I need to see someone with a body that inspires me if I'm going to be motivated.

The music is awful, the set is distracting. This is something out of a bad SNL skit. The narration (that's right, there's no live sound on these, it's all looped over in post) is often out of sync.",1423872000,,494,4.25531914893617

3841388,3,B0021R52IA,"I will agree with other reviewers that when you do this video, you feel it the next day and feel good about it.

But it is SOOO BORING!  How do you make yourself do this more than once?  There are a lot of good videos that mix it up, are engaging, challenging and keep you moving so you don't notice that time.  Not this one.  If you have a wall clock nearby, you will look at it a hundred times in a half hour, wondering how you are still there doing this tiny, boring movements.  This one sits on my shelf because I cannot bring myself to pull it out more than once-a-year.

3841393,4,B0021R52IA,"The workout is excellent.
I like how they have five 10 minute workouts.
I just did one of the 10 minute workouts and felt it the next day!

They do a lot of exercises similar to ballet moves.  Luckily, I took ballet over 10 years ago because the camera does not move or zoom in on the feet.

That is my only problem with the video...it doesn't zoom into the area of the body they are using.  I don't necessary need to see their glutes or thighs.....but would have loved to see the position of their feet.  I couldn't see if they were raising their ankles, so I had to rewind to listen very carefully to hear her say ""now lift your heels""....so I would be able to do the exercise correctly. That made this video annoying.

But otherwise, the exercise itself it very efficient.",1376870400,6,775,4.310344827586207

After reading so many positive reviews, I was convinced this workout was what I needed to mix up my routine (and bust the plateau I already hit).  I agree with some posters that it was difficult to tell if I was doing some of the moves correctly due to limited angles and dark lighting.  I guess with more practice, I'll get the hang of it.  Unfortunately, for an intermediate exerciser like myself, this video was not intensive nor challenging enough.  I completed the entire video, including all bonuses, without breaking a sweat.  My muscles did not even ache.  This video was a big disappointment.  It felt uninspiring and was not creative.  Although, I liked the instructors and background music just fine.  Since I bought this DVD brand new, I feel I must continue using this video to get my money's worth.  I am hoping I gain results from doing so.  Overall, I feel this video is ideal for beginners.

I personally like the voice overs and the environment they are in. To me it's calming rather than robotic. So I decided to add this to my rotation. I thought it worked more on the thighs than glutes. My legs weren't shaking at the end and they weren't sore the next day. So the next day I did the exercises twice. Still not sore, shaky or fatigued whatsoever. I don't exercise often so I'm not in the best shape. I know I was using correct form because I used to do ballet for 13 years. But I haven't danced in about six years so I don't think it's because my muscles were already conditioned to this type of work. I will continue with it to see if I do see any changes but so far, I don't feel my muscles working that hard.",1361145600,,871,4.159763313609467
3841411,5,B0021R52IA,"I purchased this DVD to get a sense of what a barre, Lotte Berk type workout was like. Of course, this one just focuses on the thighs and butt although other muscles are working as well. There's a lot of exercises with small movements. It appears easy but it's hard because you keep your leg raised (depending on which exercise your on) or muscles contracted for an extended period without a break. Your muscles in the standing leg--when performing leg raises--also gets exhausted.

The workout is divided into five 10-minute segments. Each one begins with a brief warmup and ends with a stretch which supposedly prevents bulking. Two segments perform some type of barre squat variation and another 2 are variations of leg raises/hip extensions. The last segment is for the pretzel move which I could not get through. All but the last segment require a barre or hip-height chair. The instructors provide enough guidance on form and do not talk as they are demonstrating the movements. They use voice-overs instead which some may find annoying, although I don't.

Overall, I would recommend this DVD. It's a nice break from simple squats and lunges.",1358121600,4,1148,4.912371134020619

3841415,1,B0021R52IA,"This is one of the worst workout DVDs I've ever tried.  I liked some of Exhale: Core Fusion's other workouts, and was sorely disappointed by this one.  Elisabeth Halfpapp and Fred DeVito perform the moves silently while their voiceover provides narration.  However, the narration is somewhat inconsistent with the visual and seems to be a bit of an afterthought.  For example, on the video, they'll change the exercise they're performing, and a then Halfpapp and DeVito will catch up a few seconds later to mention that the exercise has changed.  There is also little to no explanation of whether they're doing a particular movement for a certain number of reps or for a certain amount of time; they seem to start, stop, and change somewhat randomly, and you don't know unless you are watching closely (see aforementioned comment on audio and video not being quite coordinated).  The movements are very poorly demonstrated and explained (compared to what I've seen on their other DVDs) and I had no idea whether I was doing each move correctly or not.  I found that after doing this DVD, I had pulled a muscle in my back (probably due to incorrect technique), and I'm in decent shape (running, biking, strength training, doing yoga, and swimming 6-7 days a week).  Finally, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this workout is deadly boring.  I can't imagine doing it more than once.  I've gotten a better thighs/glutes workout with their other DVDs.

I got it because though I have always been naturally very thin, I noticed after hitting 30 that my butt and thighs were not as toned as I would like them to be. I am thin, but my lower body wasn't as toned as my upper. I can definitely feel this workout. Oftentimes I work out every other day and I do a1 of the 10 min. workouts on this dvd on my ""off"" days. While I do agree with one reviewer who said that the camera angles at times make it difficult to see what form you need to be in, I find that you are still able to get the gist of it and no matter what, you can feel it in your glutes and thighs. For anyone who doesn't have a lot of time. but likes to see and feel results instantly, this is a perfect dvd for you. I was glad I bought it and am planning on getting more exhale core fusion dvds based on this one.",1337040000,4,846,3.8125
3841429,5,B0021R52IA,When first viewing the DVD I thought perhaps I had made a mediocre purchase but that quickly changed as I stayed with it.  I am 55 years old and have worked out most of my adult life - I really enjoyed the smooth transitions as well as the incredible workout it provides.  Perfect for those days when you don't want high level cardio.,1330214400,3,334,4.285714285714286
3841430,3,B0021R52IA,I like the convenience of there being several different short workouts that you can do together or separately.  The thighs workouts were great... lots of pain the next day which is a good sign.  The butt workout wasn't as great - at least for me. I had trouble getting the moves exactly right and I never felt anything. The pretzel seemed better than the standing/kneeling thigh though. The moves are very simple but I think you have to do them exactly right to feel it.,1328918400,,470,4.517647058823529
3841431,4,B0021R52IA,"I liked this product very much for its targeted approach to muscle groups.  I was not ready for it, however because it is designed for the already fit.  There is a great sciatica stretch in there good for everyone.",1320624000,,214,4.461538461538462
3841432,4,B0021R52IA,Well organized workout.  The segments are very doable for add-ons or do several together for a complete workout.  The bonus section was a nice surprise.,1308182400,,152,5.04
3841433,5,B0021R52IA,"The plie type exercises in this DVD will make your thighs burn like mad!  Love it!  I have every single Core Fusion DVD, and I love them all, although they are each a little different.  Body Sculpt and Long and Lean are both full body workouts, the latter a little more challenging than the former.  Both Arms and Abs and Thighs and Glutes are self-explanatory.  Pilates Plus focuses on abs/core work.  And the yoga Energy Flow and the Bootcamp DVDs are cardio workouts, the latter more challenging than the former, although both are quite rigorous and will make you sweat buckets.  I have taken both Pilates Mat and Pilates Fusion classes for a few years, and these DVDs are a wonderful complement when I am not in class, and in my opinion, are sometimes even more challenging than what I get in my exercise classes.  I have tried a number of different exercise DVDs over the years, and these are the only ones I have ever stuck with.  They are very enjoyable, challenging (but not so challenging that you give up), invigorating, interesting (they do not get boring because there is so much variety built in), and I have noticed some subtle differences in my body from my work with both the DVDs and my classes.  To really burn fat, though, you have to alter your diet. These DVDs will help with sculpting muscle (like a ballet dancer's body), but not so much with fat loss (at least I have always found that my weight loss occurs with diet and not with exercise, but that's just me.)  In short, money well spent, and I highly recommend the series.",1305936000,4,1549,4.5359712230215825
3841434,5,B0021R52IA,"I love, love, love Core Fusion!  I'm a newbie, so most of the core work in the pilates and sculpt dvd are absolutely impossible for me at the moment (although I've been doing yoga for years and crunches for decades, I apparently have absolutely no upper body or ab strength!) but I'm plugging away.

The thighs and gluts dvd, however, is my favorite.  It is a KILLER. Teeny, tiny, teeny, tiny movements that burn right through your muscles and bring you right to the edge of panic before you get to release and stretch, during which time you develop instant amnesia and forget how hard it was and are all raring to go for the next set.  I felt mildly schizophrenic, what with the ""omg, no, no more!  I can't.....oh, good, another set, I can handle it!!"" comments running through my brain.

With all of that intensity, I was convinced I'd be crippled by sore muscles the next day, or day after, but to my suprise, I never am.  You can do these workouts every day if you want to, and will not suffer ill effects after.  The stretching immediately after each set of muscle movements is perfect.

And the results?  Almost immediate.  People are not exaggerating when they say that these small, controlled, posture/form-based resistence exercises provide quick results and ever-increasing strength.  No workout system I have ever used has been like this.",1305158400,24,1349,4.717948717948718

3841446,3,B0021R52IA,I used it for a few weeks but it never did anything... just not quite harsh enough to get anything done,1303171200,,103,3.9523809523809526
3841447,5,B0021R52IA,"I recently began including this video into my weekly workouts, and I absolutely love it. It comes with five 10 minute Pilates workouts that will kick your butt (literally). I've been doing the full 50 minute workout every day for 2 weeks and have really seen some results! I haven't gotten bored of the routine, and really enjoy the fact that you can turn on/off the music and/or commentary. The narrative is great in the beginning, the instructors explain which each workout does (tighten and lift your butt, or create long thigh muscles), which really helps keep you motivated. When doing the full 50 minute routine, the instructors do a wonderful job and keeping things flowing, and and the time really just flies by. No pilates equipment is needed, except a yoga mat and a chair which is nice. Even if you don't have an hour to dedicate each day, the five different routines make it easy to pick and choose what you would like to focus on. I just purchased the Core Fusion Arms and Abs DVD, and am excited to include that into my weekly workouts as well!

One thing I would suggest, is spending more time stretching in between exercises. They only spend about 1-2 minutes stretching and I personally feel that I need longer to really stretch out those areas I just worked out (to avoid bulky muscles), so I pause it for another few minutes and do a few yoga stretches, which also allows me to bring my focus back on my breathing before beginning the next exercise.

""You will feel better in 10 sessions, look better in 20 sessions, and have a completely new body in 30 sessions"" - Joseph Pilates",1302739200,4,1599,4.56794425087108
3841448,5,B0021R52IA,"The Exhale Core Fusion series is fantastic. Believe all the hype and rave reviews. I've yet to find anything like it. The exercises in their workouts involve such minimal movement, but are incredibly high intensity, as they really target each individual muscle and get it to work. You will be amazed how much you feel this workout.

This workout consists of 5 10 minute segments that target not only your glutes and thighs but also work most of your lower body including your hamstrings and calves as well as the sides of your waist and lower back. Each of the 10 minute segments is made up primarily of the same exercise repeated the entire time with minor variations, which results in targeting slightly different muscles with each variation. It offers an incredibly effective, deep work out of muscles I didn't even know existed. The 5 sections include: Parallel Thigh, Turned Out Thigh, Standing Gluteal, Kneeling Gluteal and the Pretzel. Each section features a brief warmup (very brief. knee lifts for 20 seconds or so. same across all workouts), the main series of strengthening exercises, and a stretching segment to stretch the muscles which were just worked. They explain that stretching immediately following strengthening is always part of their practice and helps to build long, lean muscles rather than bulky ones. All of the standing segments include the use of a chair for balance. No other equipment is necessary.

The instructors are clear and encourage you to work at your own pace. One typically does an easier variation and the other, a harder variation. They seemed to read my mind throughout the exercises and do an excellent job of anticipating what the average exerciser will be doing and questioning throughout the workout. For example, just as I was starting to worry that I felt everything in my standing leg, rather than my working one, they said how you are probably experiencing this and it's completely normal. At another point they said something along the lines of ""You may have a tendency to want to lean forward to make this easier but it's important to try to keep your shoulders over your hips for proper alignment"" and I laughed because even though I know the correct form, it was so challenging that at that moment I found myself leaning forward like they mentioned not to do. Their instructions are really helpful and encouraging.

In terms of difficulty level, this is very easy to follow along with and may be easy to do for the first minute or so of each exercise, but it becomes difficult quickly. I'd say it's for those looking for a challenge at any level. I typically do the entire 50 minutes in one workout but Exhale Core Fusion dvds are THE ONLY workout dvds I've found made up of shorter segments where I could honestly say one ten minute segment would still feel like I got in a good workout.

As a side note, this dvd is one of three included in the Core Fusion Collection and they are all as good as this one. If you want a better value purchase that instead here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exhale-Core-Fusion-Collection/dp/B002U1AC6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exhale: Core Fusion Collection</a>.

3841449,5,B0021R52IA,"I've been doing beginning yoga for a few years, but wasn't get any muscle tone and had kind of plateaued with at-home workouts. But I hate paying so much for the gym. This video kicked by butt back into shape, and has given me much more lower body strength to get into more difficult yoga poses. I feel so much stronger! And, as I am now firmly in my mid-30's, I had a little sag that this video quickly got under control. And my pants and skirts fit better - it really seems to amp up your metabolism and tone. I highly recommend it, though I wish the workouts were 15 minutes and included more stretching. Ten minutes often feels like cheating or like I might strain something, exercising so fast, though it works. I usually do 3 or 4 workouts at a time, and there are bonus workout which include arm exercises. I often extend the stretches a bit after the end of each workout, to really make sure things are good and relaxed.

My only (very minor complaint) is the t-shirt this gent is wearing - very Jersey shore workout wear. No bueno. Focus group that, y'all! I'd rather see a man in a tank-top than a muscle shirt.",1299369600,2,1121,4.312796208530806

3841452,5,B0021R52IA,"I ordered the core fusion collection (which includes this dvd) and the core fusion arms and abs because I wanted a strength training plan that I could do at home.  I just started graduate school full-time and canceled my gym membership to save money :)  I love pilates but I just don't have the time to take the classes at my school gym. I looked at various reviews and found a review for a ""core fusion challenge"" on a blog that I recently started reading.  I ordered the core fusion collection (which includes this dvd) and core fusion arms and abs.  I'm in LOVE with these DVD's!!  These dvd's are definitely hard and I do get sore afterwards, the workout is even better than the workouts I had while working out with a personal trainer for a year.  I love the format; it reminds me of the ballet classes/warm up exercises that I loved so much as a little girl.  I've already noticed a significant improvement in my posture.

Fred and Liz constantly remind you about your form and posture.  The segments alternate between Fred teaching and Liz teaching; they also alternate with one doing advanced poses and the other doing less advanced poses.  The reason I found this so helpful is that Fred will say something like Liz is a lot more flexible than I am, but I still feel the stretch when I do it this way.  It's a good reminded to work at your own pace!

If you want heavy weights and someone screaming at you from inside the dvd, I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere. If you want kind, encouraging instructors and a slow burning workout with stretching for balance, this is the workout for you. I love this workout and I hope you do too :)",1287705600,3,1655,4.461794019933555
3841453,2,B0021R52IA,"While this DVD may work, it really hurt my knees.  They offered variations if you have knee problems, but the standing poses were still really too much for my knees.  They were tingling after just the first workout.  Also, when I work out, I prefer not to use props.  I don't have a chair of the right height in my house for these poses.",1287446400,5,337,4.21875
3841454,5,B0021R52IA,"I had purchased this about a year ago, but then had a knee injury so put it on hold.  Waited a few months after finishing PT before I picked it up again. I had been worried that the barre style workouts would bother my knees but have been pleasantly surprised that they have not (although they probably would have a year ago).  I have used each of the segments once now, and the pretzel and standing glute segment a few times. I see myself using them as a regular part of my rotation.

I completed Parallel Thigh and Standing Gluteal Toner together as part of a longer workout.  I think the standing glute work on this DVD is easier than the similar segments on their other DVDs, but at the same time the simple moves allow you to really focus on your form and working the glutes.  Parallel Thigh includes standing plie and knee dancing variations.

The following week I completed Turned Out Thigh, Kneeling Gluteal Toner, and Pretzel.  I added in the ab segment with leg variations from their upper body / abs routine.  I had also done some traditional exercise earlier in the day but definitely had some muscle soreness the next day from this combo!  I thought Turned Out Thigh was intense. It includes standing plie variations with legs turned out and standing forward leg lifts.  While I thought the standing glute segment was one of their easiest ones, I thought the kneeling version was challenging.  As for the pretzel, I do Tracy Effingers pretzel/clam routine on a regular basis and this makes a nice variation to that.

If you really like the Core Fusion thigh and glute exercises on their other DVDs, I recommend this one as well.",1286582400,4,1641,4.582191780821918

They burn but in a good way.

5 workouts for legs and butt with a pretzel section (which is lovely for the waist as well) you can do all together or seperate parts.

I like to mix workouts on this dvd with the other Core Fusion workouts to make up an hr, which the normal live class usually is.

I even got one size bigger. You see differences very fast with these workouts. Every time I do this one it seems that my but is higher it really goes up. It defies gravity.

Unfortunately, I have lost some weight, but I have also bulked up in my lower body.  I am short too, so any kind of excess (fat or muscle) is very unappealing. Here is where C/F: Thighs and Glutes steps in!  There are 5 ten minute segments that include warm up, the exercises them selves, stretches after each move, and then final stretch.  I started this video about three weeks ago...whoa!  I have never had such thin thighs before!  I am finally getting that curve on the inside of the thigh.

It may not sound amazing to you all, but for a short person that loses weight slowly, this is almost a miracle.

I think it helps that I am already familiar with these type of exercises through past use of Callanetics (the ORIGINAL), The Bar Method, Etc..

What I like most about these DVD's is that they almost trick you into a killer workout. Your breathing, the moves are controlled, there is no jumping or running or anything like that. You just follow along, and because the segments are only 10 minutes, just when you feel your legs shaking with exhaustion, it's time to stretch!

Fred & Elizabeth push your muscles to the limit in deceptively tough routines, and I've learned not to do the whole DVD at once -- 3 10-min. segments are enough for one day.

3841474,5,B0021R52IA,"I've been doing the other two Core Fusion DVDs for months and was so happy to receive the new one that I did the whole thing at one time, then added the Round Back/Flat back Abs, the Pure Core and the stretch from  Pilates Plus and can I just say that I am sore in places (2 days later) that I have never really met before? This new DVD works all the muscles around the hips and waist as well as thighs, glutes, hamstrings and calves. What I really liked in this DVD is that Fred and Liz talk a little more about what you might be experiencing (shaking, burning, etc) and let a beginner know that this is normal. Liz has such a great body and having her do the work with a bare belly is a great motivator to see how she got that belly. Also, I like that all five segments are active, as I'm happy to do my own cool down or use one of the stretch segments from the other two DVDs. I'm looking forward to doing it again! Having all three Core Fusion DVDs allows me to program my own workouts with the convenient 10 minute (and 5 minute bonus sections, 1 each, on Body Sculpt and Pilates Plus) sections. Over time, I can go further and really experience my growing strength.
If Jillian Michaels is too ""boot camp"" and jarring for your tastes, try Core Fusion. In my opinion they are safer yet thorough and deep workouts that will get your body where you want it to go.
I can't WAIT until December when I can get the new arms and abs!",1250985600,35,1430,4.125448028673835
3841475,5,B0021R52IA,"I am a huge fan of Lotte, Bar Method (original ones and the new ones), Pure Barre (original and the 2 new ones) and the original Callanetics.  This gem of a DVD is a fantastic workout that draws on all of the techniques that I've seen in the other DVDs I have.  I did all of the segments in a row and was really sore the next day!  Loved it and the coaching and tips for alignment.  I am thrilled to have a DVD that is entirely focused on thighs and glutes because I can now easily incorporate this in my rotations that include cardio and weight/circuit type workouts.",1250294400,15,568,4.18348623853211

He's right when he says your metabolism is skyrocketing, working the biggest muscle groups. So effective and a nice change of pace if you're sick of squats.
