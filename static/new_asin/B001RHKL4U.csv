8338059,5,B001RHKL4U,"If you're a fan of old school pro wrestling but haven't checked out some classic St. Louis wrestling, get ready for a unique treat. The St. Louis territory was run by legendary and respected promoter Sam Muchnick, and it doesn't take long to realize they had their own identity and look. Over the decades, a famed group of wrestlers made St. Louis their home: Harley Race, Dick the Bruiser, Dick Murdoch, King Kong (Bruiser) Brody, Adrian Adonis and many, many others. Their top title, the Missouri state championship, was known as one of the prime steppingstones to the NWA World title, and Muchnick wielded much influence from his spot on the NWA board.
  The many volumes available on DVD are actually somewhat interchangeable; you get a handful of fun squash matches mixed in with bouts pitting top stars against each other, from their TV tapings as well as their home, Kiel Auditorium. I just selected this one to review because it has two of my favorite, and two of the greatest, workers of all time on the cover and in action against each other, Brody vs Murdoch.
  St. Louis wrestling would be a great pick for a time capsule. These were the days of Kayfabe, just before Vince McMahon Jr. and the WWF decimated the territory system. You won't see much in the way of histrionics here; no 20 minute promos, no awful backstage comedy skits. And play by play man Larry Matysik actually calls the matches with respect. So enjoy St Louis wrestling!",1423440000,,1450,4.696850393700787
