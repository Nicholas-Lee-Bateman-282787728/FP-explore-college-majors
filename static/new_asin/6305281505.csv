Here's how the story goes: Some broad on a space ship is talking into a camera, recording a recent incident that led to her downfall. The incident involves a bunch of guys hanging out by a creek, panning for gold and generally exchanging pointless dialogue with eachother. The leader of the prospectors seems to be in a relationship with some other dame who lives in a tent by the creek not too far away. While she and him engage in more pointless dialogue, another bunch of prospectors decide they want to jump the claim of the first bunch. This leads to a really lame fight in which both camps lose one member. There follows some more pointless dialogue, and then one guy with a beard goes for a long walk and starts yelling at the sky because his girlfriend got killed in the fight. We are then told, via the broad from the start, that all of this somehow has something to do with her and now everybody's mad at her so she's in jail. It ends by telling us that the guys from the creek go on to become space merceneries, which is somehow important (God knows why). The end.

Now, I have a theory about this film. First, judging by the apparent ages of all concerned, it was very likely a college film project. Second, they didn't have much money to splash around, so they filmed almost all of it at a nearby creek bed (which presumably didn't cost them anything to use). Finally, judging by the stupendous lack of action and the heavy duty reliance on dialogue, the writer was aiming to be ""arty"" rather than entertaining. It's the old it's-boring-so-it-must-be-clever routine. The trouble is, the whole thing's so damned dumb in the first place that even making it boring won't fool even the thickest of elitist pseudo-intellectual snobs out there.

The sad thing is that the title makes it sound like it could be a really hilarious romp. Even the cover art suggests that at the very least it could be a bit of a sexy exploitation film. I could almost imagine something really messed up, like Peter Jackson's ""Bad Taste"" meets ""Barbarella."" Sadly, both the title and the cover are misleading. I suspect that it didn't start out as ""Star Worms II - Attack Of The Pleasure Pods."" That was probably the title Lloyd Kaufman gave it to make sure it sold. A more accurate title would have been ""Some Guys Taking Themselves Too Seriously By The Creek."" Don't be fooled.",1151366400,,2490,4.528888888888889
7886829,1,6305281505,"I Love troma movies, but this one sucked. Its just a group of guys trapped in the a barren land having to collect a material that royalty uses to get high! There is NO NUDITY! There are no great fight scenes. It was lame.

I reccomend Toxic Avenger, nuke em high, Tromeo& juliet, and many other troma films. But save your money on this one.",1119139200,,340,4.230769230769231
7886830,3,6305281505,"Now, you may have heard that this is one of the all time great Troma films. Although this is probably the best low-budget sci-fi film ever made, it can't hold a candle to ""Dog Years"",""The Toxic Avenger"", ""Buttcrack"", or ""Terror Firmer"". Personally, I was dissappointed, but if you want to see every well-known Troma film ever made, it's worth checking out.  But I would purchase this after getting MUCH better flicks from Troma, such as ""Combat Shock"", ""Mother's Day"", and ""Rabid Grannies"".
The plot is that four prisoners are trying to get off a prison planet by finding Purple Fleck. There was never a Star Worms I or III.",981158400,,624,4.724770642201835
