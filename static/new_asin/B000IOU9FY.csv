2662056,5,B000IOU9FY,"Julia Child's advice for the good life was ""Find something you're passionate about and keep relentlessly interested in it"".  Well here are eight stories about people's passion for Elvis and each one is interesting.  If you're looking for some new gossip about Elvis's eating habits get yourself a cheap magazine.  But if you want to meet some interesting people with fascinating stories see this documentary.  The producers found a wide variety of Elvis's fans, friends, associates and colleagues.  Then they skillfully interviewed them and let each one tell their own story.  The stories are woven together with still pictures, news footage, original music and comments from Memphis personalities.  The filming and editing keeps the stories moving and keeps the viewer engaged.  In case the movie leaves you wanting more check out the additional features that include 45 minutes of expanded interviews and photography.  Well done.",1160006400,6,931,5.36551724137931
2662057,5,B000IOU9FY,I felt as though I was literally walking the steps of Elvis's life as this documentary tore through Graceland... amazing interviews with the heart and sould of Elvis's fans and those that knew him well!!,1158537600,,203,4.828571428571428
2662058,5,B000IOU9FY,"""Altered by"" is a much different experience than what Elvis fans and collectors are used to getting in a documentary about the King.  This is a hilarious portrait of a handful of the King's lesser known servants, jesters, princes and paupers living in the wake of one of America's greatest performers.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1158537600,2,327,4.927272727272728

2662125,1,B000IOU9FY,There is nothing about this dvd that is remotely worth seeing. Most of the things on here said were from two people that did not make it in show business and therefore said lies about the best entertainer in the world. The best that ever will be or that has been. And yes I know what I am talking about when someone comes up after someone is gone and tries to down someone they really have  a problem with their own life. Know wonder you did not make it you are dirt ugly and can not sing,1420934400,,488,4.030927835051546

I thought the subjects were interesting, but I felt this had a lot more potential and could have been longer with lots more in-depth content.
