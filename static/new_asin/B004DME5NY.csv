4332685,5,B004DME5NY,"This documentary is fascinating and challenging.  The only misstep might be the inclusion of an unshaved Joe Rogan as the host.  The artwork throughout the video is gorgeous and the anecdotal praise of the psychedelic experience is kept to a low rumble. The typical inarticulate stoner rants are not present here. Thoughtful, beautiful, and worth the time to explore what for many has been a life-affirming and mind-opening experience.  This type of informative, measured psychedelic documentary is exactly what should replace the kind of hysterical ""Reefer Madness"" propaganda that helped to usher in the current 'war on drugs' dogma. The only complaint is that the documentary is brief.  I'd love to see more.",1317686400,19,711,5.265486725663717

4332688,4,B004DME5NY,"This is a very interesting documentary about DMT, a psychedelic hormone/neurotransmitter that exists in the human body naturally, and is also found in many living organisms around the world.

If you've read Rick Strassman's book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, this documentary further explores his studies by bringing in various experts to discuss their thoughts on this somewhat taboo topic.  There are also face to face interviews with several of the research subjects involved in Strassman's DMT studies.

If you are already interested in these kinds of things, you'll love this documentary.  In addition, I think this DVD would be a great way to introduce someone to this foreign world of psychedelic experiences, thoughts, and philosophies.  Where our society demonizes psychedelic drugs, this documentary does a good job in showing how pivotal such substances have been in the maturation of human beings across the vast landscape of time.",1301011200,2,940,5.36734693877551
4332689,3,B004DME5NY,"I'd like to say Hippy-bunkem but, well...not really. There is a lot of interesting insights and information about the role of certain chemicals in the brain, but for my money (though I would like to be convinced) I am not convinced of the Spiritual Nature or Significance of DMT. I'm really not.
Those of us who have tasted psychedelics will be aware about amazing visions and insights that we get as a consequence of super-activity in the chemical brain under their influence,but to then call it other than great perceptions and/or profundity of thought is a little far-fetched but hey, this is only my opinion.
The format is basically talking heads and a few incredible psychedelic moving films and shots: worth watching just for the latter! A little over-priced for what it is as far as I am concerned",1297209600,4,804,4.7913669064748206
4332690,5,B004DME5NY,"I am not overly into ""spirituality"" nor do I think science has all the answers.  This documentary is about our perceptions of reality through the use of a drug every human uses every night when they sleep.  This drug (DMT) is something I did not previously know about and I find absolutely fascinating.  Check it out, Two thumbs up!!!!",1297123200,4,335,4.6440677966101696
4332691,3,B004DME5NY,"I own and love DMT: The Spirit Molecule (book) by Rick Strassman. It is a very professionally done treatise on the subject of psychedelics and DMT in particular. It is both rational but also very personal, and for the reader it is easy to discern when Strassman is talking about fact, and his feelings.

In this documentary, however, it is hard to get a sense of what in the world these people are talking about. Unlike the book, there is not a linear dialogue, an apparatus that is set up to help the viewer understand the thesis. It is really a bunch of clips of people talking, random animations of psychedelic art and other video clips, with little sense of structure. I got most of what people were saying because I have read the book and studied a lot of the content talked about, but even I got lost at points because there is no real narrative here to follow.

This documentary would have been much better served if it were A) Longer, to allow for B) a structure.

The DMT subject is a profound one, and one I have spent a lot of time reading about and studying. This documentary, however, to me feels like it would turn off the lay person because it will just throw out the idea of entities and alien contact without the context one has while reading a book on the subject.

I can't really explain it any better than that. Just because it's a documentary about psychedelics doesn't mean you have to construct it like a psychedelic trip. Any scientific documentary, even one that angles spirituality, needs structure to maximize the ability of the viewer to become familiar with the subject.

All in all I suggest skipping this and going with the book. After reading the book, then watch this and you will find some enjoyment in it.",1297036800,48,1740,4.511111111111111
4332692,5,B004DME5NY,"In LSD - My Problem Child, Albert Hoffman wrote that retarded people would often be taken aback and somewhat surprised as to how boring and completely ordinary a figure he cut; he being the inventor of LSD and all. Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, was also an intensely private and very boring character; this is why NASA picked him, and not the charismatic Buzz Aldrin, to be the first man to make history; the fame wouldn't go to his head, you see. The dry stick award mind, goes to 'my boring life' Nicolaus Copernicus. Even though he demolished 2000 years of religious dogma, biographers struggle in vain to find any dirt on Nicolaus Copernicus, and he has a revolution named after him!

So there really is something to be said for boring people, isn't there? It's as if the boringness of a person is in adverse proportion to their honesty; or something like that. So along comes another charisma vacuum, made flesh in the form of Dr Rick Strassman. Softly spoken and seriously boring, Dr Strassman is a safe pair of hands to conduct the first human studies with the drug N,N-Dimethyltryptamine; and what amazing good news he's discovering for our nihilistic age.

The results are in, Dr Strassman's test subjects are reporting worlds of Galileon proportions, with titanic implications for our decaffeinated existence. His unique, and it seems never to be repeated, study of the effects if the chemical, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on human subjects, conducted in the University of New Mexico in the early 1990's, deserves to be recognised for what it is; a spiritual cleansing ointment to wipe away the dreary materialism which troubles our sad world.

So what happened in this study? The shadow of God was revealed to the participants on the hospital trolley, this is what they are saying. Though nowhere do they use my lazy word, 'God'. Being Americans, they say 'UFO', or 'Aliens' or 'greens' and 'entities'; so I hope you can appreciate me sticking with God.

We should keep in mind, however, that for most people, the word 'God' has been bled dry of meaning. Obviously the God up there, who hung the stars like lamps in heaven, has little meaning today, the DMT world, a world of cascades and horror, is full of meaning; this is the message.

Why should we still use the word God, if the concept is a hollow shell? Well I'm not obsessed with grey aliens, you see, or unidentified flying spaceships and I have neither the wit nor verve nor the power of utterance to invent a new word, so I will stick with God, but in a less fire and brimstone way.

Fire and brimstone will surely get knocked out, and in the first round too, by the DMT flash. A flash? Because, like the flash of a camera, the experience is that quick. Well about ten minutes, which is lightning quick when compared to the average 9 hour psychedelic trip. This is the DMT experience.

The DMT flash reveals a world that is impossible to exist, but is does; like the music of Bach but in a higher definition or Einstein's equations before Einstein was born (insert your favourite impossible thing).

Some people can see further. If you fly over your hometown, on Google Earth, you notice the higher vantage point straight away. You would never have guessed that there where so many trees surrounding your hometown if you stayed on Earth. Zoom out a little and the view becomes higher. Now you see mountains and seas. You apprehend more because you are high. When you come back down, try explaining what you have seen to your friends. Chances are, if your friends have never risen to those heights themselves, they won't believe you. You will then get thrown into the cooking pot!

Surely when we down into the DMT flash, we witness grandeurs beyond grandeurs, chasms over chasms, deeps beyond deeps. Just like in mathematics where there are infinitudes of higher orders infinitely transcending lower infinities, so the phenomenan of consciousness can no be thought of as a revelation of infinities overlapping our hum-drum monkey mind.

So to my mind, gathered from the 'trip reports' in this book, and now on You Tube, some form of consciousness is more than sparks firing inside the brain because the higher consciousness is more than an algorithm, and the way Kurt Godel proved that mathematics, at the highest lever, is more than a closed system, well is seems that consciousness, even though algorithmic at the base level, is Godelian strange at the higher level. That is, Kurt Godel showed that mathematics can release formulas out of the equation that shouldn't be there, so DMT is revealing 'entities' that should definitely not be there!

If you went up in a hot air balloon you will notice the curvature of the planet. It was only your limited horizon that convinces you that the Earth was flat. Indeed, the Earth is flat from where we are standing, this is the point. We can thus argue that it is the limited horizon of Dan Dennett and his peers that convinces them that the mind is mere brain goo. You see, like the example of the balloon giving you and I a better vantage point, psychedelic drugs rip the mind out of the mind equals brain dogma, to open up a higher horizon.  No wonder these things are illegal!

Personally, I reckon that we need no longer fear death because of this (we can still fear dying though) and we can stop worshipping the dreary materialism that is hurting our planet, like a furious madam with a tight chain, because we believe 'this is what we deserve' or 'we can't get any better'.

If what is in this book is true, we can forget atomic colliders and our fascination with human genome projects; they have their place in our world, of course, but what Dr Strassman's study has uncovered, and this is science at the cutting edge remember, what he's done is to point towards salvation after death and a real delving into the possibility of a post death reality for you, me and the girl selling crack down the road.

Salvation after death you say? After reading what the DMT test pilots are reporting; I wonder. The studies that Dr Rick Strassman conducted are suggestive of doorways to something lurking just before birth and existing way beyond life: so claim those who have witnessed! The doorways must be the portals to the higher lights His Holiness The Dalai Lama speaks of, otherwise the human race contains madness in the head, madness that the DMT experience is revealing in all who take it. Far better to see the experience as being not a part of the hallucinating brain, but of a different order of existence. This word, 'hallucination', is merely a get out of jail free card for reductionist psychology. If you can't explain it, it's a hallucination. It is most unfortunate for the academics that the hallucinating excuse holds no water when in the presence of the Titan. The DMT Titan is an entirely different order from your hum drum multicoloured merry-go-round trip.

What is this different order of experiencing that will not fit our words, this thing we all fall into, when we take DMT? It transcends language and understanding but the closer you search inside the more will be revealed to your startled eyes. We are so close to the zero point, we are that close to the transcendental object that all we need to do is to plough the Dimethyl Palace, like a serf ploughing the Lords field, and there it is!

There is one thinker who ploughed the field of hyperspace and came back with similar stories to Dr Strassman's test subjects. He was Terence McKenna, the most gifted and remarkable inner-explorer of his generation; indeed, Terence is reveared as a psychedelic god at Ronald McDonald's wasteland.

McKenna resurrected the psychedelic corpse back in the 1980's and early 1990's. When the rest were watching Dallas and worshipping Ronald Ragan, the hyper charismatic Terence McKenna would tour the United States and tell his eyed witness testimony of the field to those who cared (not many did care back in the yuppy 80's). Terence talked and raved, then he died.

Happily, Terence's voice has been recorded for you and I to listen to, and if you listen to Terence's testimony, you will realise that only a real witness to the mystery can sound as crazy as he did. It is very hard to fake that sort of ecstasy, you see. An ecstasy that is repeated again and again in the study at New Mexico and deserves a few cheers from happy humanity. You see, there is much hand-clapping over the particle accelerator at Cern, more so than the New Mexico study. It's supposed to mean something to you and I that a particle is proving Einstein wrong. Well what would you do if somebody informed you that you have a better toy inside your head? You would probably stop smashing particles at close to the speed of light, after you experience what happens after a DMT experience.

The thing that the DMT experience does, so claim Strassman et al, is to show you the doorway into a hyper-reality. This is exciting, however, because of the propaganda, only those already in the know will ever get to hear the good news.

Terence McKenna, the godfather of the DMT craze, used to say that in a propaganda free society, the DMT experience would make headlines, 10 feet tall. McKenna often spoke in reverence of the DMT world and he was convinced that ""this experience is of a fundamentally different order than anything this side of the yawning grave"" (Terence McKenna).

McKenna argued that trying DMT isn't like trying a bicycle or wind surfing, hobbies that if you never tried between vagina and grave you would not be at a loss. Oh no, DMT is not a mere fad, 'it is your birthright' (McKenna). Spinning widgets or sitting in a neon-lit cubical isn't the reason why you were born. The real reason for your birth, according to Terence McKenna and all real philosophers, is that the DMT place is so so real and this invisible presence gives you an itch for something that you cannot scratch. An itching for the metaphysics that the 'philosophers' in the academy have abandoned for university careers and a place in the New York Time best sellers list

The DMT: Spirit Molecule book is a few years old now and the idiots we call our neighbours are still reading Harry Potter and Dan Brown! ""Watch the documentary and spread the word and I hope the multitudes will awaken"", so says the ghost of Terence McKenna (probably)!

Strassman and McKenna, the oddest couple one could come up with. How can two opposite characters, in fact, extreme ends of the personality pole, come to the same conclusion about the DMT experience? There is a hint to the validity of the experience somewhere in this dance of ying and yang.

Strassman and McKenna argue that ""the DMT molecule is a trapdoor to the higher lights, made flesh by the dark Gods that turn the millstones of the world"". DMT ""is THE SECRET"". Strassman injected his patients so as to manage the dose for the scientific study. McKenna, on the other hand, smoked royaly. So after smoking DMT, you realize that the idea behind life is that your life isn't working the 9 to 5 or getting oblivioned every weekend; rather, your life is a gap between the two eternities where you actually have a chance of finding out what the hell is going on. But if you're consuming the culture dangled before your literate eyes, then you are living somebody else's idea of what is going on. Somebody else's idea of who you are. The DMT experience breaks the shackles of somebody else and throws you into Gods cockpit, for a few minutes.

Terence McKenna joked, well I hope he was joking, that God leaves the room to get coffee, and by some crazy coincidence, this is exactly the same that you take the DMT and this is why the DMT place is so 'GODS KITCHEN but weirdly familiar at once, like a pun but punning a million times over, but you still understand the message.

McKenna's somewhat fetishtic worshipping of DMT is understandable, because ""monkey politics"" had led him to ""utter despair"", as it does most people, in fact, Terence McKenna fought the demon of nihilism more than most and he probably battled his demons by hyping the mystery, to repel his personal tremors and to spreading the hope.

However, it is most unfortunate that hope from a preacher of otherness would be off-putting indeed to those who enjoy thinking for themselves; especially in the West were we are rightfully suspicious of this sort of talk. If its not Roger Penrose talking about Plato, than why listen anyway? However, Terence McKenna did have a great story to tell and today, because of Dr Rick Strassman's findings, Terence was closer than he dared imagine.

Terence McKenna often spoke in reverence of the DMT world; with the oratory power of an ecstatic poet, and, more impressively, he wasn't high at the time (I hasten to add). McKenna was convinced that ""this experience is of a fundamentally different order than anything this side of the yawning grave"" (Terence McKenna).

McKenna argued that the DMT flash had repeatabality and he speculated on the afterlife because of this repeating place he went to on DMT. Drinking coffee in Paris or debating which is the better phenomenon, the Simpsons or The Matrix, is not the way to do philosophy. Trying psychedelics is the only game in town, so argued Terence McKenna.

This is what philosophers are supposed to do, that is, they are supposed to be perturbing their minds eye so as to snap out of the trance they are living in. The Greek philosopher, Plato, called this trance The Cave and he founded the original Academy, in Athens, 2500 years ago, to debate the Cave with his pupils. It is a damn shame then, that today, Plato's descendents are wasting their 1000 months on this planet debating the color red and writing rubbish that will fly up the profit machine dangling from Oprah's expensive udders, and sit on the New York Times best sellers list.

New York Times best sellers don't ask questions to awaken the slumbering God within you and I. New York Times best sellers never ask are you not after all a citizen of the mystery of life, rather than a consumer of somebody else's idea of what the mystery? They never tell you that someone else has your transcendence already packaged for you and it resembles a flabby version of the mystery, were you are forced to do some job which you not hate, in order to live, before you can devote the rest of your time to what the Hindus would call your sadhana -- the work for which your deeper nature has appointed you: your life's dedication. Instead of devoting yourself to sadhna, the shopping mall is your cathedral and your mortgage is your mausoleum.

Shopping and dying, what a way to go! This is why the DMT phenomena is worth a serious concideration and maybe, just as our world is dying, we have discovered the antidote to materialist reductionism. And the Cambridge biologist Rupert Sheldrake agreed, he calls DMT a 'necroptic substance'; because of its catalysing powers, that is, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine has the ability to throw the mind into the post death state, just like Terence McKenna. Both believed the DMT experience to be the closest thing you will ever get to the after death state and still come back. The molecule is the door-frame and we step beyond it and see wonderful things. McKenna was convinced that these things had an ontological validity independent of our thoughts and feelings about it. ""More like shifting fantasy land than good old positivist rock n roll"" (McKenna).

If only these themes could be pumped out into the flabby consumerist world of Simon Cowell's dancing tits, then the DMT truth would be a phenomenal hit because, to my mind anyway, these ideas are more fascinating than all that Dan Brown rubbish which passes for the mysterious these days. And that mystical, 'get a fit girl my thinking her into existence' 'The Secret' windbaggery is hucking in the retarded herd; get them all to try DMT; thus they shall learn!!! DMT is the real secret and the experiences we hear so much about in the UFO Times and the Discovery Channel really can't touch the DMT flash for scientific validity and, more impressively, for spookiness.

This is high blown philosophical silliness for those who haven't had the experience but, as Terence was forever arguing, the drug only lasts about seven minutes and it is physically safe and so the sceptics should try it for themselves. Alas I'm not aware of the sceptics taking McKenna up on the offer. The sceptics, you know, may be mind-locked drones, terrified of the void which lurks outside their peer reviewed living rooms, but I suspect the real reason they ignored McKenna's challenge was because of the oratory firework show that spewed from the bards mouth! Terence, you must understand, was at the extreme end of the DMT cult, and these days the DMT community really does feel like an obese cult, and this is why, Rick Strassman is important; I am not joking when I say that his boringness can pop the New Age trappings of the DMT flash and bring legitimacy in through the back door. Compared to Terence McKenna, Strassman is safe and straight and his script is so down to earth when compared to the spellbinding oratory tricks of the bard McKenna, that his boring elocution is much needed over a charisma god! Smart people have had enough of spellbinding orations and, time and time again, eyeballs just roll at maniacal prophets with idols to smash. Like St Terence of McKenna.

Terence was indeed an overly excited prophet; he could just let rip with lines off the top of his head; like; ' clap the gods into town and the voice of a thousand elves thunder into local fields of awareness; and these ""local fields are foetal human minds, being born, hurried and buried into the bones of our dying world"". You will never feel this because our brain is a filter that cuts your mind off from the DMT place. McKenna went on the speculate that the evolutionary purpose of this cutting us off is obvious (well to him it was!). If our cave dwelling ancestors had access of the radiance the DMT space, 24/7, then they would be getting eaten by sabre toothed tigers at an alarming rate! So the brain protects us from this radiance; thus we can say, using modern concepts, that the brain acts like a protective firewall and N,N-Dimethyltryptamine can override this neurono firewall"". McKenna can talk like this for hours and hours, and without notes too! When assaulted by his vocal range, we are converted to his way of thinking, and so we are hypnotised with the spellbinding trick of McKenna's oratory power. McKenna argued that DMT is a neuro-hacking agent to God. Unfortunately you need a massive personality to convey these ideas and not come across as all silly sounding. But this is the realm of the saint rather than the scientist. St McKenna sure was bananas to us scientific types, and he may well have been pulling our legs; he once referred to himself as being a functioning schizophrenic, a unique genius who was convinced of the banana realms inhabited with extra elves! Again, Dr Strassman covers similar weird things but with a different personality. So what i am saying, if anything, is that two opposite personalities are coming up with the same message ergo, the DMT realm (whatever that may mean) is a real place. (I'm aware that the concept of 'real' is a sloppy word, but there you go).

Strassman's study then is less titanicaly hatched than Terence McKenna's scipt. What Dr Strassman's subjects are reporting, and this is in the book, are multi formed high definition elf embodiments that are impossible to exist in this world are revealed to your startled eye. Angels of demonic intensity, syntactically shifting gestalts of life and death representations, and in high definition too. Apparitions made out of silicon and trees that resemble demigods from Indian art that gallop around inside the hospital room and carry multiple meanings all at once, such as punning in many domensions. They flicker like this in chaotic frequencies that leave the mind trailing and so the more you look the less you are able to pour language over. Most of Strassman's subjects say that they understand the DMT message, but on awakening the message quickly dissolves and they cannot remember anything; ""it's like an involved dream that we forget as soon as our feet touch the bathroom floor"" (McKenna). The subjects also report floating in deep space, looking at long dead alien machinery from the end of time (seriously, just read the books or listen to You Tube) and space-stations orbiting fantastic forgotten worlds. You will be greeted by telepathic elf machines from this universe that communicate in syntactical information that are extraordinary complex, impossible to fathom but very ordered. It somehow all makes sense. Now I must add that this all sounds stupid and this again is why Strassman is important. He seems completely sane is what I'm getting at.

Terence McKenna used to tell a story of giving a huge dose of DMT to a very old Tibetan monk whilst travelling through Aisia. The monk was ""not one of those alcoholic fundraiser Lamas, but the real thing"" (McKenna) and the monk told him that the DMT experience was the lesser lights and that you cannot go further than this and return to your body. The monk told him that when we die our mind is cut off from its host (brain) and falls through the brains physical barrier and journeys back through the lesser light and into the spirit realms. (""I believed him, McKenna said,"" the guy took it like a man, I mean; he must have been over 90 years old""). In the presence of this spirit then, all the capability of human conception sinks exhausted, with nothing to hold onto but a fall into a place outside of metaphysics; a palace of radiant light. The misery of trying to pin down weird experiences with words, and saying that it would be like trying to eat fire with an axe. Profound experiences you see can never be embodied or wrapped up into words. Those who know would never tell anyway! This is the original doctrine of awakening you see; the original Buddhahood. When done correctly, this doctrine will break open your hopelessly dreary reality and set you on your way to Nirvana. Unfortunately, only the special adepts achieve this goal; Nirvana was not meant for the peasants. (Forget all that Mahayana 'everybody for the ride' rubbish peddled in the west). Fortunately, we now have the new-kids on the block; the psychedelic experience and the DMT flash. These drugs can open the gates to worldwide Enlightenment, that is, they are for the masses. The DMT flash is an especially fast track to the above. It is even more unfortunate then that the DMT experience really is impossible to describe with a voice box and a pen. It's this impossibility of 'solid' evidence that leads those who refuse to step off the merry-go-round of consumerism to conclude that these things are mere hallucinations. It is all an illusion apparently and so smart people just refuse to look at DMT and other possible worlds. Yes sure, they believe in the possible worlds the quantum physicists tell them, but only because they don't believe it! They will never try DMT, why? This great refusal to see isn't a new phenomenon.

Galileo experienced the same frustrations with his peers a few centuries ago when his fellow professors refused to take a look through his telescope. So it behooves us to remember that it wasn't the peasants who refused to look through Galileo's telescope but the scholars with their learning from Aristotle and the Bible. That was 400 years ago but this conservative archetype resonates today. Today it is the psychologists and philosophers, with their learning from Darwinism and Einstein, who refuse to take a glance at psychedelic drugs (they argue that it is all an illusion), whilst outside the academy, the peasants if you will, are partying hard!

So those today, who are claiming it is all an illusion, have to remember that the same thing was said about Galileo's discoveries. Casare Cremonini, the most renowned Aristotelian philosopher of the early seventeenth century, is remembered today as the professor who refused to look through Galileo's telescope (for this Galileo called him 'simplicio'). It was in 1610 when Galileo looked through his telescope and saw the moons of Jupiter. He then realized then that what Aristotle said must be wrong, and the Bible too. Galileo hurried to tell his fellow peers, including his good friend Cremonini, that what they have all been doing for 2000 years was completely wrong and that he had the proof, ""look through here and see the proof for yourselves"", Galileo would have said. But amazingly, instead of wanting to see these new truths for themselves, Galileo's peers stubbornly refused even to look through the lens! The churchmen of Galileo's day dismissed his telescopic insights as being an optical illusion or hallucination and so not worth further investigation. These medieval professors didn't have to look through Galileo's telescope because they knew what they saw with their own naked eyes (they just knew they 'knew' from 'pure reasoning' in those days!). For thousands of years the naked eye was the only tool available for science and it worked just fine; from advanced mathematics in Greece and India to gothic architecture and beautiful art, this progress was all done with the naked eye. We naturally induce that `this is all there is', but paradoxically, without evidence. This has become known as the paradox of inductive reasoning. It is not logical to infer from an observation, even if that same event happens a thousand times; but the old dogma just kept sticking around. So if Galileo saw the heavens in conflict with the prevailing Aristotelian dogma, then what he saw must be a hallucination. Because astronomers could already see, they concluded that a greater seeing was not possible and so a telescope was impossible! (Gremonini was well rewarded for his junk philosophy by the way. Just like today's academics). Today it is the professors of psychology and philosophy dons who refuse to look into psychedelic drugs. Humanity has made great progress with the naked (unperturbed) mind they say; indeed, we have built brain splittingly complicated intellectual atom smashers with just our normal conscious awareness and so conclude that this is it and that nothing lurks beyond the normal local mind space.

Well today telescopes (and microscopes) are legal and thus we have made progress in the material places. It's a crying shame then that the perturbing of mind is frowned upon by otherwise very intelligent people who really should know better. (Even some reviews of this book dismiss it as some sort of druggy fuelled stoner hippy fest! This is a stupid point to take, but as the saying goes, ""against stupidity the Gods themselves contend in vain"": Schiller). Today it is worldwide illegal to study these spiritual molecules or even to disprove this spiritual springboard hypothesis. Instead we only allow science which completely gives up the ghost in favour of advanced technology, but, in so doing, reduces all matter to flying atoms screaming through empty space, blind and indifferent to our whims. Nobel laureate physicist Steven Weinberg captured this weltanschauung beautifully when he said: ""All the explanatory arrows point downward, from societies to people, to organs, to cells, to biochemistry, to chemistry, and ultimately to physics."" He thus concluded, ""the more we know of the cosmos, the more meaningless it appears"". Thus science is meaningless for salvation. Are we not taught this version of reality in school?

Human institutions are carved up into many metaphysical millstones, grinding away at our spirits and, according to this world view, printing stamps of stupidity onto the minds of men; alas, this is a very hard stamp to shake off. This stupidity has forced psychedelics underground with the other good things of life! N,N-Dimethyltryptamine is seen as evil because it does not fit the prevailing orthodoxy of our times, and even more so, Terence McKenna argued that it threatens our moral bourgeois institutions and the entire capitalist ethic of fearing your neighbour as you fear yourself. This stamp of fear runs deep in our nature. We naturally fear weirdness and clench our fist in moral rage at anything deemed divergent. This fear archetype is imprinted deep in our collective history. For example, in ancient Rome, charitable Christians had to contend with furious emperors and a blood thirsty colosseum. During the middle ages, hurried and harassed families had to dodge an oligarchical priesthood and a stern Church dogma; and today's free spirits must look over their shoulder, in fear of a furious busy-body class, cultural cardinals (politicians, media editors), and an overly enthusiastic police force. The stamp of human nature runs deep indeed.

It may well be a human nature which deems the laboratory of mind as escapism. This is wrong. It is not escapism, or cheating, to use drugs in philosophical endeavours, just as it is not cheating to use a telescope to view the moons of Jupiter. Ok you need an education to use a telescope (or microscope) so educated people should be able to at least have the chance of disproving Strassman's hypotheses. This is how science is done. The collective stamp or the foot print of genius then has come so far. Our foot is printed on the map of the ontological process, and all progress is driven by a cerebral cortex and the imagination; DMT will turn this purple prose into a reality argued McKenna! This other world is a puff away (if smoked that is).

Is there proof? Well if you read DMT: The Spirit Molecule it's the strongest conclusion I can think of. Well that, or Rick Strassman and his many subjects are lying through their collective teeth for some strange reason!

(P.S... So which type of proof does Dr Strasmann provide? Well it's not material proof that you can hold in your hands, like a light bulb. Nor is it a mathematical proof that can be shown to smart people. The stories in here are only witness testimonies, but by reputable witnesses like doctors, business people and artists; that is, none retarded citizens. Unfortunately, a successful guy's testimony is still retarded proof to build such grand claims. However, let's be honest, our justice system is built on the testimony of retards; and we all love jury service, so we shouldn't dismiss witness testimonies so easily. Ok it may be retarded to trust mere `stories', even if the people are upstanding members of the community, held in high esteem by their peers; there is always the possibility of retarded dreaming; if not downright lying! But the witnesses to the DMT experience feel convincing to me and, to my mind anyway, they seem intelligent and articulate about what they have witnessed and so cannot be easily labelled as retarded New Age void people. So we are forced to take the position of jury members (retards) and that really is the best we can do. What a bummer!

4332693,5,B004DME5NY,"When I heard that a DMT film was being made, my initial thought was that it would be yet another drugumentary. I was wrong. The film deep dives into questions of human consciousness, interviewing brilliant minds (and more PhDs than I could count.) There were interviews with a rabbi, artists Alex and Alison Grey, a tribal leader, scientists, and the leading researchers on DMT and ethnopharmacology, along with the accounts of study participants and the nurse who cared for them during the research studies. The perspectives from which the experiences are conveyed spark some deep questions about human consciousness and the human spirit, and when the film concluded, I was left with the feeling that there was much more to the human experience than I could ever imagine. The visual art and music are equally as awesome. Since the film was released, I have bought a few copies for friends who all shared the sentiment that they wanted to watch it again and share it with their friends.",1293235200,27,986,4.875
4332694,5,B004DME5NY,I read Dr. Strassmans book some years ago and loved it. I was so excited to hear they were going to make a film about it and now it is finally here ! The film is about as perfect as a films like this can be. Superb editing and in a tight package that is well under 90 minutes-about 73 minutes to be exact. The only part of this project that is disturbing to me is the obviousness of this substance and the almost complete disinterest by nearly everyone in western society but I don't blame the film for that for the most part. I do recommend reading the book though first. In the book there is a greater emphasis on the entities encountered by the volunteers and the similarities of these entities I find most fascinating.

4332719,2,B004DME5NY,"DMT is a fascinating molecule and you will learn a good deal about what a DMT ""trip"" is like in this film.  However, be warned and watch with the knowledge that there's an awful lot of pseudoscience, misinformation, and speculations/hypotheses which are presented as facts in this film.  We're not even certain that DMT is produced in the pineal gland; that's a complete speculation made by Strassman (author of the book that this film is based on who did the DMT research study) because ""it seems to fit with my other hypothesis that the pineal gland produces psychedelics"".  That's a direct quote from Strassman.  It's not a fact; it just ""seems to fit"" with his other speculation that the pineal gland might produce psychedelic chemicals. Likewise, the ""DMT exists in ALL living things"" assertion that Joe Rogan and others are so fond of making is also not a fact; there is only evidence of DMT existing in a fairly large number of plant species and 4 animal species.  That's hardly ""all livign things.""  Saying it ""potentially exists in all living things"" (as McKenna does in the film) is VERY misleading - the assertion is that tryptophan exists in all living things and DMT is only 2 enzymatic steps from tryptophan and all living things have the enzymes and catalysts necessary to synthesize DMT from tryptophan.  That assertion is a pretty big stretch, to say the least.  Using that criteria, there are literally thousands upon thousands of chemicals that ""potentially exist in all living things.""  Further, DMT MAY play a role in dreaming and in near death experiences.  MAY play a role.  Not ""it is a fact that DMT plays a role in dreaming and NDEs"" or ""numerous studies and experiments show that DMT likely plays a role in dreaming and NDEs"", but rather unconfirmed speculations that DMT MIGHT be involved (as far as I can tell, these assertions are based only upon the fact that the experiences are similar).  There is certainly zero evidence that DMT acts as a ""gateway"" or ""doorway"" between the soul and the body and other such nonsense that a number of people claim in the film.  DMT is an incredibly interesting little molecule that MAY serve some deeper purpose in humans and mammals, but currently that is all unfounded speculation.  Far too much of this film relies on these New Age pseudoscientific speculations presented as facts or likelihoods (they are neither factual nor likely).  Subjective hallucinatory states brought on by powerful chemicals cannot be treated as literal, actual visits to real ""alternate dimensions / realities / planes of consciousness / alien entities"".  That's a very powerful assertion that requires an even greater amount of evidence.  ""It felt so real"", ""I know it was real"", ""you don't know until you've experienced it, then you'll know it's real"", etc. are not valid pieces of scientific evidence.  Much more research needs to be done into DMT before any of the speculations and hypotheses put forward by Strassman, et al. (and repeated erroneously as proven facts by Rogan) can be confirmed (or, more likely, debunked).",1358121600,10,3074,4.924418604651163

 I have to say,however, that it was a little bit disconcerting. I listened to these doctors talking and the only one i really liked told everyone that he finally quit doing the research because he really felt he was using the subjects for his own scientific interests and wasn't that concerned with the volunteers themselves.
  This drug is apparently very,very powerful and no one has any business using it for recreational purposes. Until they find out a heck of alot more about what the long term effects of this drug are i would not even use it under clinical circumstances because it really appears to make LSD look like Tylenol. I'm sure humans have some form of DMT in our brain naturally-however I don't agree with this messing around making it in labs as-it just sounds like the trip when you go on it is too weird!",1357689600,,923,4.615853658536586

4332722,1,B004DME5NY,"The title is sort of misleading. I rented this thinking it was going to be a deep thought provoking scientific and philosophical documentary about this DMT molecule in the title. At first, I didn't know DMT molecule was a drug (sure, call me prude). But about 5-10 minutes into it I realized it was totally different from what I expected. It WAS a drug movie, about pot usage in a cultural sense (regardless of what many are saying). I'm a big documentary fan, this isn't a normal documentary with science. Some reviewers said it interviewed scientists and PHD's ??? To that I say, they sure didn't make use of those peoples' scientific knowledge! They kept scientific anything to a pitiful minimum. They wasted the scientists knowledge by asking dumb non-scientific questions about ""is it possible this person feels spiritual when high""??? All feelings, and no science. This film is dominated by images of many cliche stoners getting high in different places, for the sake of being high. It's NOT about the DMT molecule itself, which could be discussed separately from the pot culture if they allowed it. Instead, they chose to focus on filming others getting high smoking pot, and a few other drugs - but the theme remains seeing others ""getting high"".

The whole time people are getting high on pot, saying gibberish things and smiling like stoned people do - all the usual stoner culture cliches you've seen. It points to other cultures who have used marijuana for rituals or ceremonies, including the use of LSD and other hallucinogenics, without ever moving on from ""getting high"" to the actual DMT molecule education/science/evidence. We already know that pot gets people high, that's not news or science - even if a scientist replies ""yes they could be high"". For example, can this molecule (not the pot) be synthesized? Where else is it found? How does the DMT molecule work alone in our chemistry, and it is useful, how? Do you have scientific evidence and peer reviewed studies backing your theory (you never state it clearly)? How has it earned the name ""spirit molecule""?  It was disappointing - I actually had a good laugh while the surprise worse off. The first 10 minutes reflects the gist of entire film. It should be renamed ""getting high around the world"". I honestly felt like this film was made so a group of stoners could write off their pot lifestyle journeys.

In summary - if you were someone looking for real information about the science behind the DMT molecule itself (from any source, not just pot!) this film would be the FARTHEST thing from helpful to you.",1353369600,2,2587,4.8352144469525955
4332723,3,B004DME5NY,"The subject matter is intriguing and might be something that could change our planet on a fundamental level. But the producers really missed the boat in the way they put this whole thing together.

Here's the scoop. DMT (N-Dimethyltryptamine) is a psychedelic compound found throughout nature. It's a naturally occurring chemical abundant in all life forms both animal and plant. The important thing is that it might be a compound linking human consciousness to the cosmos.

This is a mixed bag. You have some really cool, bright and ethical people heading the study, along with a real mixed bag of people partaking in the study itself. There are writers, a shaman and various other types who relate their experiences while on the drug. It's kind of weird because, as they tell of what happens, it's almost like listening to the 60s hippies talking about LSD trips. But as it rolls on you realize this is much deeper than that. This is more than a ""wow man"" kind of experience. Luckily, those who do the relating are of a relatively high degree of intelligence, so what they say is interesting and worth note. They consistently tell how they, themselves disappeared during the 'trip' and entered the whole of the cosmos. They felt as tough they were experiencing a oneness with the universe. I know how trivial this might sound, but hearing them talk about it is something else entirely. You see how past centuries of those having mystical or religious experiences might be experiencing more than just a trick of the mind.

On the down side were some poor decisions. First off: What possessed the producers to hire Joe Rogan (of ""The Fear Factor"") as host? Sorry folks. For my dollar he lacks the depth necessary to carry off a subject as important as this. Then they compound this mistake by filming his segments in black and white in some cheesy looking lab setting. Then they run that footage through a filter to make it look somewhat like he's supposed to be a Rod Serling type character hosting a 50s TV show. And in trying to relieve the audience from having to endure a never ending series of talking heads, they introduce a lot of hallucinatory and mystical type animated graphics. Some were cool. Some seemed a bit silly.

I was hooked by the end. In wrapping the entire thing up I got to see how important this really is. The possibilities of taking it to a wider and higher level could be profound. I couldn't help but think what would happen if all the world's leaders went through the experience. The entire course of the planet would change overnight. Those who headed the study do speak of possible applications and it's all good. At my age I doubt I'll get to see much of this, but my sons will hopefully reap the benefits.

This is more three and a half stars than the three I gave it and it's absolutely worth the time to view it. If you're at all into this sort of thing have at it. It will give you great food for thought.",1352419200,6,2942,4.585551330798479
4332724,3,B004DME5NY,"This was a very educational and enlightening film.  I have always been curious about ayahuasca. My disappointment though was that the film didn't really have any ""call to action"" or ""to find out more, you should do XYZ or go to website ABC"".  I think all good documentaries not only document something, but they should also invite their audience to do or feel something.  That ""something"" could be anything from inspiring people to volunteer or help a cause, to simply learning how to eat better or ways to reduce your carbon footprint.

This film was almost a ""tease"" in the sense that it showed several people who were lucky enough to experience DMT, but most of us won't ever get to experience it. They all said it was an amazing ""life transforming"" experience, yet didn't tell the audience how we too could experience it. For example, it didn't give any information about how to volunteer for future studies or perhaps how one could go about making an ayahuasca trip to South America (my friend made one such trip...I'll have to ask him!).  It also didn't direct the audience to a website for more information or even give people a ""call to action"" to write to their legislator asking for more studies on DMT.

  Perhaps a bit too heavy on the scientific end, it nevertheless gives one some perspective on on the setting under which research was attempted. One can easily find Terrence Mckenna's viewpoints online, so I don't miss his input all that much.
  I agree with one reviewer that the computer graphics are a tad excessive, but they balance the talking heads to give one some feel for what the experience must be like, visually. Extended discussions of synapses and brain chemistry are nice, but I'd love to hear from more folks with a spiritual - meditative background.

The first half of the documentary was really boring and it wasn't of content that I found useful.
They didn't really explain what DMT was and what it does and that sort of thing.

4332734,5,B004DME5NY,"DMT: The Spirit Molecule, is not only an educational experience, but a resonating experience that clings with you. The need to call friends over to watch the movie for the 2nd, and 3rd times, never gets old.

Everyone at some point asks the question of what happens when we die. Also, what is death? Could it be the dissociation into another world of love, compassion, and surrealism. DMT: The Spirit Molecule, moves through every aspect of DMT, its history, its physiology, it's experience in the hands of some of the smartest, most creative people in all of our curent reality.

 Joe Rogan, narrarates in his hyerfocused, analytical mindset, and leaves his raw power humor off the table for a few moments. To see Joe so serious, about the proper education and the removal of dogma/stigma that inhibits people from  opening their minds to a possible Spiritual Existance outside, or inside, or of our reality, is refreshing. This is a path, for the first time in our modern age, we get to speak with the Ancients Wisdoms locked within the body.

 Dr. Strassman, provides clean cut clinical proof of the power of this amazing neurotransmitter that floats around our brains daily, which possibly could be the connecting to a higher spiritual state, a god head, or maybe just the life/death cycle. Between the Egyptian and Tibetan book of the dead, there is no doubt an airy electromagnetic energy looms over those who have mastered this corner of reality. Either though Shamanic practice, clinical application, or trips into the Rainforests to explore the worlds with the Shaman of today, its clear that anyone touched by this message wants to pave it forward.

 It was a great day sit and watch the Movie in its entirety. Hands down our generations first real look into a new and exciteing epoch of human spirituality mixing with modern day techonology.

Mitch Schultz is a stunny documentor, and any project he touches is apparently blessed by the message at hand. The Universe would not let this message be handled by anyone less, than a team of  those who found the connection themselves, or through a shaman.

Simply, its time to resonate a message across our planet. That is we are here first to Love, and fighting is only a result of egoic love over shadowing Universal love. =-)",1317772800,3,2284,4.8158567774936065
8425621,4,B004DME5NY,"The main claim of this documentary follows Rick Strassman's idea that DMT is a central molecule for a spiritual conception of our universe. There have been similar claims about various spiritual traditions with a similar underlying psychedelic culture such as Sufism, Buddhism, and Shamanism. However, this documentary only highlights the Kabbalah among these traditions while neglecting all other spiritual cultures with similar connections. It would have been really helpful to their claim of metaphysical universality of DMT if the producers had given a chance to diverse spiritual perspectives rooted in various other cultures.",1527984000,,631,5.795698924731183

8425624,4,B004DME5NY,"This is brilliant in its way, as trying to get across to an audience the infinite and incredible worlds inside the psychodelic experience is impossible without actually using the substance.

8425625,1,B004DME5NY,"How did they manage to turn what has to be the most fascinating topic in the universe into a 1 1/2 hour piece of boredom ??  One interview clip after another. YAWN.  The equation does not work, apparently, with even the most bizarre and interesting of topics. After listening to the tenth person talk about the political/social/pharmacological implications of the stuff, I had enough. At the very least, Terrence McKenna should have been given a bigger piece. His insights on the subject are absolutely fascinating. (I believe he's the reason DMT is such a hot topic these days)They could have at least devoted SOME of the time to people's personal experiences with it - each one unique, dramatic and fascinating. Instead we just get a little taste in the beginning.

If you have a report due for Social Studies class, fine. Otherwise, take my advice and go back to browsing.",1484524800,,875,4.82

This is an incredibly awesome documentary.  If you watch it and enjoy it then I cannot recommend highly enough that you get the actual original book of the same title, or listen to it unabridged on Audible.
This is a CLASSIC example of a ""the movie was good, but the book was WAY better"" video, but in this case it's totally worth it to go the book route even after seeing the movie.  There's a TON of information that's left out of the video because even if they'd recorded all of the book at 1.5x speed for the video, the movie would end up being around 14 hours long.
Do yourself a 'huge' favor and get the audio/book version, unabridged and unedited, especially if you've already seen the documentary!",1436659200,,753,4.611940298507463
