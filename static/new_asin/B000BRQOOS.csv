8091663,3,B000BRQOOS,"For those fearful of buying a Platinum Disk, this one is actually uncensored. It's standard definition, so a bit blurry by DVD standards, but a decent print. The film is what it is, a soft-core sex film with pretensions of being a psychological drama, or maybe vice versa. Worth it for the charming and lovely Chase Masterson (Leeta on Deep Space 9).",1236124800,4,350,4.661290322580645
8091664,3,B000BRQOOS,"This movie is basically a documentary that follows a typical movie plot about how affairs, pregnancy scares, and cheating issues confront sexually active couples. The plot is about average, but it does not follow a good story line. The movie is basically about how sexual problems mess up and change the lives of about 4 couples. It has good communication pointers, but this movie does not live up to its name. If you like the kind of movie that has a lot of sex in the story line, and a lot of drama, then this film is for you. But if you are looking for a true movie that follows a good plot, I recommend something like ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Basic Instinct"" if you want nail biting suspense or something like ""When Harry Met Sally..."" if you want a good punch line to a romantic story. Its past its time but is still a laughing riot. Otherwise the film is boring!

The sex scenes were awesome and is the only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars. If the sex scenes were so-so, I would have given it only an average rating with only 2 stars. Good music in the film to boot which is a plus.",1129939200,2,1089,4.260869565217392
