We learn one or two new things about Columbo in this episode: he's just adopted an unnamed old dog and he definitively loves classical music. A scene like the dialogue between Falk and Cassavetes about how much does the orchestra conductor earn per year is a little pearl and the performance of John Cassavetes, in front of his musicians, during the concert and during the rehearsals is praiseworthy. Season two can only be a winner with such an opener !

A VHS to keep in your library.",1179187200,,1738,8.440217391304348
