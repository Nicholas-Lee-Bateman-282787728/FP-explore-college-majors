2739194,3,B000MQCUKU,This was a disappointment from the first one.  The storyline just didn't have much depth to it.  Many of the plotlines were left undone at the end.,1254700800,,147,4.407407407407407
2739195,5,B000MQCUKU,"I had no idea there was a sequel to the ""Moment after 1""  until I was ordering another DVD.  Was not disappointed.  Both videos are must viewing ""for such a time as this"".  I am hoping there is a sequel to the Awakening. . . .but then we already know the ""rest of the Story"" (Revelations).",1235260800,,289,4.107142857142857
2739196,4,B000MQCUKU,"In many ways, ""The Moment After"" movies (1 and 2) are as good as the ""Left Behind"" movies. Some of the transitions are choppy and don't flow well but, even though the sequence isn't always clear, the gist of the plot comes through. I liked the acting and the strong messages throughout the movie. I loved the part where the actor said, ""I may have to do this again tomorrow"". I think most of us can relate to that, and thank God that His mercy is new every day for that very reason. It definitely left loose ends, so there has to be a ""Moment After 3"" at some point. I look forward to seeing it.",1230854400,,595,4.137931034482759
2739197,5,B000MQCUKU,This was a good movie depicting what it might be like after Jesus returns for the Christians.  It was thought provoking.,1219881600,,120,4.714285714285714
2739198,5,B000MQCUKU,"Excellent sequel to ""The Moment After"".
This DVD leaves room for another possible sequel so bring it on!
If you enjoyed ""The Moment After"" you will enjoy the sequel.
The movies take place after the biblical rapture. Love David White's acting and the other actors are just as good.
Just enjoy this movie but get ""The Moment After"" as well and watch them in order!",1212969600,,362,4.584615384615384
2739199,3,B000MQCUKU,"Not as good as the first one, but I still cared about what happened and it still entertained me.  The plot was kind of slow-moving, and there were some new characters that kind of had their own subplot that I thought was unneccessary.  But the end was good, and left a big cliffhanger for probably The Moment After 3.",1178496000,2,317,4.3559322033898304
2739200,2,B000MQCUKU,"This one surprised me, it wasn't nearly as good as the first Moment After movie.  It started out OK, but then got bogged down and kinda fizzled.  Very few, if any, special effects, just didn't seem to have much to say.  Not only that, they left everything up in the air, I guess so they HAVE to make part 3!  I just hope part 3 will not dissapoint like this one did.  I still love Brad, David & Kevin tho......they're always a treat to watch, even in this clunker! They're AWESOME in Six-the Mark Unleashed!

2739208,4,B000MQCUKU,Movie was really good in respects to end times prophecy and was a great staring point for the 2 main actors. David AR White (Revelation Road) and Kevin Downes (Courageous) Highly recommend,1378598400,,188,4.90625
2739209,5,B000MQCUKU,I now have both movies and I am impressed and looking forward to sharing this movie with friends.  This would be a great missions tool to share with the non-believers.,1377129600,,167,4.566666666666666
2739210,5,B000MQCUKU,"I really enjoyed both of these movies. A huge surprise. Really enjoyed the acting. I normally nitpick movies with bad acting. I do see a problem with people being saved after receiving ""the mark""... however.. there wasn't any ""worship of the beast"" to go with it, so I dunno. I wouldn't chance it in real life. Thought the movie was definitely beleiveable and a God- send.",1348358400,,372,4.651515151515151
2739211,4,B000MQCUKU,"The Moment After 2 - The Awakening is the second part of the two part film beginning with The Moment After.

The opening scene shows the FBI agent in jail, and his release.  His partner has not been with the agency for a while, but is forced into working for the military man who wants his partner found and will do anything to achieve that including taking the chip out of his hand to obtain his goal.

This second part has more action than the first, and has a very good end you won't want to miss.

I recommend buying the set together.  It is worth your time to watch both of them.  It is also a very good youth group film they will enjoy watching and talking about when the movie is over.",1310169600,,692,4.126865671641791
2739212,4,B000MQCUKU,"I tend to view Christian movies as a dramatization of Christian principles, ideas for reflection based on what happens on earth.  For instance I saw Fredericks as the beast whose purpose is to intimidate or strong-arm Christians.  Fredericks doesn't care about anyone, not even his own, and sees Christians as defenseless prey, weak and at his mercy. The weapons on earth to develop against Fredericks is faith which gives the weak the overcoming courage to stand ground, rather than to stand down.",1292112000,,498,5.060975609756097
2739213,2,B000MQCUKU,"This movie wasn't to good to me, could of had been made more and more better then it was and is.

2739214,5,B000MQCUKU,This follow up to the moment after is awesome.  I've become a huge fan of David White and have been watching all of his movies i can find.  This one really is worth buying or renting!  The fight scene at the end is awesome!,1269475200,2,223,4.0227272727272725
2739215,5,B000MQCUKU,"The first movie was ok.  This one was very good.  Not quite how the Bible tells it, but there is a good message in the story line.",1268956800,,130,3.7777777777777777
2739216,1,B000MQCUKU,"I have a large collection of Christian movies, and I especially like David White & Brad Heller.  The Moment After is my favorite rapture movie, hands down.  Unfortunately, however, part 2 is just awful.  I truly love most Christian movies, but this is so poor.  The violence is just disgusting.  It seems as if the movie was created to be disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing.",1266364800,11,388,4.647058823529412
2739217,4,B000MQCUKU,"First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of David White, Brad Heller, and Kevin Downes. I find their movies to be inspirational as well as entertaining, and I get the impression that these actors are all sincere, faithful Christians. God bless them.
 Overall,I was not disappointed with this movie. As sequels go, it continued the storyline of the first installment quite well. If you watched and enjoyed ""The Moment After"", you should like this one as well.
 Although I am giving this film 4 out of 5 stars, this is due primarily to the strength of the performances by the above mentioned trio of its stars. But TMA 2 certainly is not without flaws. I'm not talking about technical, nerdy movie critic-type flaws; just a couple of things that kind of irked me. One thing was the bad guy character Captain Jackson, portrayed by Lonnie Colon. I found Jackson to be annoyingly cliched and unbelievable, and Colon's over-the-top performance was to me, clownish and unconvincing.
 Flaw number two, and this was a big one for me: in the course of the film, Jacob Krause (Brad Heller) prays two or three different times, and every time he prays not to God, but to Jesus. There is one instance where incredibly, he asks Jesus to forgive the thugs who killed two of his friends. Now, I love Jesus as much as the next Christian. But folks, you do not pray to Jesus. You pray to God THROUGH Jesus. And Jesus does not grant forgiveness. If He did, there would have been no need for Him to ask God, as He was dying on the cross, to forgive those who crucified Him (Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. Luke 23:24)
 That said, I am looking forward to TMA 3, or whatever the next film starring these three talented Christian actors may be.",1266278400,,1745,4.477987421383648

8170936,4,B000MQCUKU,"This was a sequel to The Moment After with David A.R. White and Kevin Downes. It's been awhile since I bought this for my private home collection, but have enjoyed all that David A.R. White has done over recent years. He gets better with age and experience, not only as an actor but as a film-maker (under PureFlix movies). Both he and his wife are in many of the most recent movies he's filmed and I've not been disappointed in any of them these past 7 years. There are some with Kevin and Bobby Downes in them you will also enjoy!",1390694400,,532,4.2772277227722775
