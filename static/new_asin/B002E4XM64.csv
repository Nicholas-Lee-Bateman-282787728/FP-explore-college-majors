8366823,1,B002E4XM64,I love Maria Dolores Pradera and bought this DVD based on a previous review.  I was disappointed. I wish I had purchased one of her CD's instead.  The sound quality and the image are poor and it is not enjoyable to watch.  Fans of Maria Dolores Pradera will best served by getting one of the great CD's.,1281484800,4,303,4.280701754385965
8366824,5,B002E4XM64,"It is a must have DVD for Anybody that likes traditional Spanish songs.

The fact that She recorded this in her seventies, makes it even more

special.

Her voice is still as great as ever.

My thanks goes out to all people that made this production possible and to

Amazon for having it sold to me.

Thanks,

Bas.",1169164800,3,314,4.310344827586207
