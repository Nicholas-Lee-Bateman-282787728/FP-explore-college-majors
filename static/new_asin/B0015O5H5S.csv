3146043,5,B0015O5H5S,"I have purchased, watched or listened, and thoroughly enjoyed all of Brad Stine's past CDs and DVDs, but with ""Wussification,"" he is at the top of his game! He covers a wide variety of topics yet never spends too much time on any single subject. And his interaction with the audience flows naturally.

If you like comedy...
If you like creative comedy...
If you like comedy with substance...

And you don't want to have to turn down the volume for every swear word, as you have to with other comedians...

Then I highly recommend this DVD/CD set!",1301702400,5,546,4.608247422680412
3146044,5,B0015O5H5S,"Another great video by Brad Stine. Ranks ranks up there with the great comics of yesteryear like Bill Cosby, Dick Van Dyke, and Red Skelton.
If you think profanity is funny, buy something else.  Stine doesn't need cheap humor to have you rolling on the floor.  The truth is funny enough.",1297814400,4,287,4.607843137254902

3146057,5,B0015O5H5S,"Don't go writing me hate mail because you use a dialysis machine-- this man makes you laugh so hard your internal organs will feel like they're exploding. It is now a policy in our house that before anyone watches this, they have to go to the bathroom- it saves Spray'n'Washing the couch every time we view it. As you may note from the title, Brad Stine doesn't have any pity for whiners or the PC crowd- he considers them spineless and not worth his attention, except when it comes to their kindly providing him plenty of material for his comedy. If laughing yourself sick is your goal, it would be difficult to watch something more prone to help you succeed in your quest to bust your own gut. On the other hand, if your feelings are easily bruised, and you have failed to Put A Helmet On, your wussification is probably already at an advanced stage, but you can be saved- watch this, avoid whining, and learn to laugh at yourself. If you can't laugh at yourself, well....laugh at other people.",1355097600,3,996,4.50828729281768
3146058,5,B0015O5H5S,"I have watched other comics that weren't the clean comic.  After editing out their crude talk and filthy language, you really end up with no show.
That's why I love Brad Stine's 'Wussification'. You don't need a parental chip in your t.v.---everyone can watch.  It takes an intelligent person to keep his comedy act free of vulgarity and still be genuinely funny.
Now, Brad's not PC--he tells it like it is and I love that. Being un-PC myself, I tend to get slammed for it and it's gotten ridiculous. Like Brad, I don't intentionally try to be mean but I'm not sorry for speaking my mind and being myself.  In the words of Brad Stine, ""If you're offended by the truth, that's your problem.""  He's right: America has been wussified because it seems you can't even breath without offending someone.
Brad tackles all subjects; nothing's off limits. From Christians to ahtiests, he includes everyone in his act. No one's left out. Not only is he down right honest about both sides of the 'belief wall', he makes it funny. Christians can be a little sullen and tightly coiled and athiests can be offended by what they don't believe in.
This is a comic you can watch without having to worry if little ears are listening.
If you're the type of person that gets offended: Don't watch this.
Easily offended athiest? Easily offended Christian? Suggestion: Take the stick out of your butts; loosen the sphincter and get over yourself.
If God didn't intend for us to laugh and if He didn't have a sense of humor, He wouldn't have invented the FART.",1340755200,2,1536,4.656826568265683
