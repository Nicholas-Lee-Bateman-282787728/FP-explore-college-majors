7022984,4,B00TY0W7TY,"I truly enjoy this series.
Finally a old fashion mystery series without disemboweled people and detectives that are more depressed and depressing that the criminals they chase the seem to be in every new show.
This Father Brown may be written a bit too modern in ideas, and few episodes are bit silly, but in the whole a good show.
The cast is great and  Mark Williams is the perfect Father Brown.",1501027200,,397,4.513888888888889

7023008,5,B00TY0W7TY,"This is a continuation of the best presentation (video) of the Father Brown stories with a superb cast that leaves the audience feeling they really are the people they are playing.  Other than Mark Williams, my favorite is Nancy Carroll who plays the Baroness of the area.  She's a hoot and ends up doing things she would never have dreamed of doing like getting her Chanel dirty, all with a very dry wit.  The writing is very well written, and in this set unlike those with Kenneth More of the 1970's in the role of Father Brown, John Light plays Hercule Flambeau when he is still a rogue rather than after his reformation which makes for a nice difference between the two series.  Thankfully, this series is being made at least through 2017 and hopefully for even longer.  Nothing against Kenneth More, this production is better produced, better acted, more lively, and just plain great as most English series are today.  Were it not for English productions put to DVD, or shown on DVD our TV and DVD player sales would plummet.",1477612800,8,1030,4.631868131868132

7023016,5,B00TY0W7TY,"The BBCs Father Brown mystery series are real treats. There are tons of humor amidst the murders and some great characters. A couple of Father Browns recurring cohorts have expanded their roles in Season 3, and it is a pleasure to get to know them better. These are the amateur detective sort of mysteries, set in the 1950s, so don't expect police procedurals with an emphasis on forensics. The show takes place in Gloucester in the ficticious town of Kembleford.

In addition, as is true of the original G.K. Chesterson stories on which the characters are loosely based, Father Brown is always and foremost more interested in saving souls than in meting justice. He also doesnt lie, which makes some of his linguistic contortions funny. I thought this set's ""Judgement of Man"" episode particularly good.

Season 3 originally aired in England in January 2015 with 15 episodes. The first 8 episodes were released on DVD for Region 1 as Season 3 Part One. This DVD set comprises Season 3 Part Two, with 7 episodes. Each Season 3 episode is 45 minutes for a total of 315 minutes of viewing for Part Two. On the DVD, episodes are presented in 16:9 anamorphic and Dolby digital 5.1. English subtitles are available. There are no DVD bonus extras.

.Episode 9 The Truth in the Wine Lady Edna and her son, Colonel Anthony, are having a wine tasting. Father Brown, Lady Felicia and Mrs. McCarthy wouldnt miss it. Its the first vintage from a vineyard the Colonel planted when he got back from WWII.
Gregoire Bisset, the winemaker, leads a tour of the press room: We grow Seyval blanc, which creates a beautiful white juice. Ill show you. He holds a wineglass to the spigot of a giant vat, but what he pulls is red instead of white. Sacr Bleu - somebody has dumped a dead dog into the vat!
If only the dogs death was the only murder.

.Episode 10 The Judgement of Man The introduction takes us to Leipzig, Germany, 1943. The Gestapo pushes into Ephraims home, snarling, Wo ist es? (Where is it?)  ""It"" is a medieval painting. The Gestapo leaves with the painting and all the people in the house.
Move to the 1950s, when the series is set. The Belvedere Museum is having a by-ticket-only special preview of its new exhibition. The star of the show is its new acquisition, Trial and Retribution"". Father Brown fears that master thief Flambeau will not be able to resist this new treasure. But there is much more going on in this episode than simple thievery. Great plotting, I thought.
Note: We first met Flambeau in Season 1 episode The Blue Cross, and again in Season 2 The Mysteries of the Rosary.

.Episode 11 The Time Machine It is a dark and stormy night, and Georgina and Arnold Francis hear loud whirring and glass breaking upstairs. When they go to investigate, their nephew, Jacob, exults, It works. It actually works my Time Machine!
Nobody believes him, and Lady Felicia asks Father Brown to consult. Jacob is manic depressive, obsessive, and, lately, delusional. His father died last year. Suicide. Thats why Father Brown is on hand to witness Jacobs demonstration of his time machine. Quite amazing, really. Until somebody dies.

.Episode 12 The Standing Stones Its dead of night, and a trembling Ginnie Godden stands in a ring of standing stones, next to the inner basin stone, ancient and pitted. She murmurs, caressing the stone, If its true what they say that you have the power of life and death, I need your help. An illness has arrived in her village of Standing. It is inexplicable, terrifying and seemingly unstoppable. When push comes to shove, are we really less superstitious than humans 5,000 years ago?
Oddball does not equal murderer  or theyd have arrested me.

.Episode 13 The Paradise of Thieves St. Marys, Father Browns parish, is in dire need of a new roof. Mrs. McCarthy and the Father are appealing to Mr. Harrogate, the bank manager, for funds. While they're chatting, two men burst through the banks front doors wearing black masks, pointing guns and shouting, This is a robbery. One of the robbers takes Mr. Harrogate to open the vault with the only key. The huge door is opened, and there, lying on the vault floor is Harrogates very dead son-in-law.
A locked room mystery on Father Brown! It also has one of the most unrealistic pocket picks Ive ever seen on TV.

.Episode 14 The Deadly Seal The introduction: And on Thursday, I took the Lords name in vain when I got a splinter. Father Brown is hearing confession from a man with his hat pulled down to shade his face, who continues, One more thing. By 11:00 in the morning tomorrow, Bishop Talbot will be shot dead. And the confessor flees.
Father Brown cant divulge what was heard in the confessional, but he can act when he knows someone is going to be killed.
This episode has funny moments with the continuing antagonism between Father Brown and his Bishop.

.Episode 15 The Owl of Minerva A raggedy man runs along a railroad track as we hear the BBC News on Mrs. McCarthys radio: A major manhunt has been launched in Kembleford, Gloucestershire. Police are on the hunt for an escaped prisoner, absconded from custody Described as a male in his 30s, six feet tall, slim build, black hair and clean shaven.
The raggedy man makes it to the St. Marys confessional box, where we and Father Brown find out at the same time that the raggedy man is  well, it's a real surprise!

Great entertainment!
