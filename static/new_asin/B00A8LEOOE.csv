8548323,5,B00A8LEOOE,Powerful film. A gem if you're looking for something indie and thought-provoking.,1462752000,,81,5.833333333333333
8548324,3,B00A8LEOOE,"We Pedal Uphill is entertaining enough to keep me watching, which is not a trivial accomplishment considering the fact that I probably have some form of ADD, at least when it comes to watching movies. Unlike other reviewers, I was not bowled over by its power and profound insight into how neurotic our country has become in recent years. Maybe it's because they saw it while Bush was still in office and I didn't.

One of the best things on the DVD is Roland Tec's commentary. It is lighthearted and intelligent and does much to dispel the rather pompous and weighty view people seem to have taken of his movie. He and his collaborators talk about how political some of the earlier-filmed segments were in comparison to the more relaxed and less paranoid view of some of the later segments (in order of filming, NOT of presentation).

In general, the movie is entertaining and well-constructed; but it's not the work of profound, life-altering and transcendent genius some reviewers say it is. The title segment, in which PR folks agonize over an upcoming Presidential cycling photo-op, is hilarious.",1372896000,,1101,4.882352941176471
8548325,5,B00A8LEOOE,"Do not see this movie alone!! It is made up of 13 short films--each a masterpiece in itself. You will want to talk about each one!

Amazingly--or perhaps brilliantly--each character was developed to an impressive level of depth. The thread that ties these stories together is the atmosphere of our country post 9-11. Although each story is independent and the characters do not intersect, there is power in the order of their presentation.

My only criticism of the film is that toward the end my mind was so full and each story so intense (Though,some had humorous elements too!) that I temporarily lost my memory of the earlier characters. With a DVD, you can give yourself an intermission and avoid that. I did remember and reflect on each of the 13 afterward. Part of this fullness may be a result of how the film leaves many details and ensuing outcomes to one's imagination. I am wondering what will happen next...and then a new story begins. Most of the time there were beautiful transitions allowing for adjustment.

The movie would be less with a single character's story missing. I would love to comment about each one, but do not want to spoil your surprise. Suffice it to say, you will be taken for an emotional and contemplative ride along the landscape of human character. You will see people both rise and break in the face of extraordinary pressures, or perhaps be extraordinary in the ordinariness of life. One thing is for certain, after seeing this film--the ordinariness of life and people's actions will never be ordinary again.

I look forward to this DVD version, which I believe includes commentaries by the producers. I had seen ""We Pedal Up Hill"" in the theater.",1358380800,2,1688,4.790378006872852
8548326,5,B00A8LEOOE,"As a talented writer, composer, and director Roland Tec uses a series of vignettes in We Pedal Uphill that has a journalistic/docudrama feel to it.  We have the opportunity to view the lives of individuals from many walks of life struggling to make sense of a civilization that has not come far in securing civil rights for all.  The characters we meet in this film seem familiar. They could well be a neighbor, a family member, a friend, or us.

In the film we experience a democratic government reacting to terrorism through fear, and as a result, incriminating it's own citizens for standing up for their rights and the rights of others; another moment in the film reveals a mother concerned about her son's safety as he takes a public stand for what he believes in; next we view the painful reminder of the ongoing racial and gay discrimination we are still facing in this country.  These are a few of the haunting themes that prevail in this important film.  History repeats itself unless we remain informed and aware.  Roland Tec accomplishes reminding us in We Pedal Uphill.  The cast and story reveal these issues without being didactic or giving us answers.  We, the audience, are left with thought provoking questions of our own.  We can only hope to see more great work from Roland Tec in the near future.",1358294400,2,1316,4.6869565217391305
8548327,5,B00A8LEOOE,"Lance Armstrong isn't the only one pedaling uphill these days...Check out this film and you'll know what I mean. Great movie! I tend to like mystery and suspense so I wasn't sure I'd be into this one. Happily, I found all that and more. From the first moment I was totally engrossed. It's inspiring, thoughtful, provocative entertainment with truly impressive acting and writing. There's a little bit of everything-drama, comedy, political thriller. If you see this with friends you'll probably be talking about it for a while. Part of what is sticking with me is the music. I loved the gorgeous choral arrangements and some great dance tracks. Everything works. It's a good time and I would definitely recommend it.",1358208000,3,716,4.975
8548328,5,B00A8LEOOE,"In what I worried would be a diatribe or a scold or a film of despair, Roland Tec has done (again) what he does so beautifully--found the stories inside the story of 911. This is one of those films that you'll see once and want to see again, and then again--its power sneaks up on you from behind. Some extraordinary performances, though as others have mentioned, I think I shall never forget the librarian and her resistance to the Patriot Act. See this film!",1357257600,4,460,4.488095238095238
8548329,5,B00A8LEOOE,"Saw WE PEDAL UPHILL in it's original release at the Cinema Village and went back for seconds. Roland Tec has created a hypnotic tapestry about the ""W"" Bush years in America although much of the dread and paranoia from the time still exist in our heatedly divided country. This is not a movie attacking any one President though, but the effect that a way of thinking and doing things has had on us as Americans in the dawn of the 21st century. Whether it's showing the affects of crystal meth on the gay community or wondering what mysterious thing happened to a librarian who stood her ground or a mother's lament over her grown son's decision to attend a rally in a racially divided town, tenderness, political savvy and humor shine. Character actress Mary Louise Burke has an astonishing/unexpected turn as a not quite informed tour guide that will leaving you wincing and laughing.",1357171200,4,884,4.746753246753247
