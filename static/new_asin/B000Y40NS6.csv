Chock full with wonderful information in the fun and engaging delivery. I would recommend this to all my peers, or to anyone with a child who wants to learn more about famous artist.",1474848000,,305,4.464285714285714

8230942,5,B000Y40NS6,"While I absolutely LOVE this DVD (I have seen it before), I am upset because when I opened the package, there was a ""Sale Price"" sticker on the DVD for $14.98. I paid full price....I will be returning it....",1402531200,,207,4.333333333333333
8230943,5,B000Y40NS6,"Being an elementary art teacher, this little video about Warhol is perfect for this age group.  In a cartoon format, it has a nice variety with true photos interspersed to make the story more real for the kids.  It was accurate historically, but not so involved that it was too deep for the students.  I really like the format and content.  I would highly recommend this for any classroom teacher.  The video also arrived very quickly.  Thank you.",1303948800,,447,4.666666666666667
8230944,4,B000Y40NS6,"""Wow.""  The price on this DVD here is quite high!  That either means it's rare or possibly going out of print...  However, check your local library.  This DVD only runs about a half hour, and mostly made up of cartoons and cliche' humor when it comes to conveying Andy's personality and quirkiness.

It's a great intro to getting your kids to think about their own potentials in art.",1251676800,,383,4.573529411764706
8230945,5,B000Y40NS6,"In addition to what I was already expecting, I really appreciated the period photographs and archival information in this DVD. These historical touches were a nice surprise in a children's video.

Kids may like the funny and engaging animation, but I liked seeing a photograph of Warhol as a boy. Hey, everyone came from somewhere.

This video does a pretty good job explaining modern and Pop art as well. It would be a helpful tool when introducing young ones to art.",1233532800,,468,4.765432098765432
8230946,5,B000Y40NS6,"This DVD provides a quick animated overview of Andy Warhol's life and art. Don't worry, all the parts that are not appropriate for children have been left out.

It keeps the humor that is in Mike Venezia's books but adds a lot more examples of Warhol's artworks. The video does a good job of explaining the characteristics of his Pop art in ways that are easily understandable. It's very child-friendly.",1232409600,,403,4.757142857142857
8230947,5,B000Y40NS6,"An animated Andy Warhol tells us all about his unusual life in this DVD adapted from the book series by Mike Venezia.  Music, contemporary photographs and art reproductions make this an educational as well as entertaining introduction to the world of pop art.  This DVD was selected by ALA's Association for Library Service to Children as a 2008 Notable Children's Video!",1211414400,,371,5.065573770491803
