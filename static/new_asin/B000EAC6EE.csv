8325030,5,B000EAC6EE,"Gary Kleiner has devoted a good many years to exploring and extracting the most out of VEGAS editing software. We are lucky that people like him are willing to put it all down so that the rest of us can get up to speed with a minimum of drama.

I'd recommend that you also get the companion set for DVD Architect3 (DVD Authoring with DVD Architect 3) that Gary has also produced. The 2-disc set is only $79.00 and covers all the nuances of the DVD Architect Program. Using this package will set your work apart from those who simply fire up the program and ""Drag & Drop""",1140220800,,570,4.277777777777778

8325032,5,B000EAC6EE,"First of all, congratulations on owning one of the best NLE softwares on the market today....Sony Vegas 6. Your next step is to purchase the Vegas 6 Companion - DVD Trainer from Gary Kleiner. I've used quite a few DVD trainers in the past but Gary's approach is so much more personal, patient and thorough. You never feel rushed viewing the program and I really enjoyed that! I especially recommend this DVD trainer if you are just starting out using the Vegas 6 software. You will learn the program 10 times faster than if you used the written manual. He fully explains all of the software features of Vegas 6 and there is a handy index to help you find your specific topic.",1140220800,3,675,4.495934959349594
