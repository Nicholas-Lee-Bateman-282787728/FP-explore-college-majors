It is calming, centering and a great place for young ones to learn about taking care of themselves and listening to their heart.  If I could give it 10 stars I would!",1403740800,,332,4.593220338983051
3622781,4,B001H5108I,"I'm not Sikh, but once attended a Kundalini yoga class at a 3HO group outside of Orlando over 20 years ago.  It was really enjoyable... and they had awesome chai.  I remember feeling so energized after.  I had always meant to find another class, but hadn't had much luck.  Based on that one experience, I had guessed that there might be some chanting involved. (I was completely lost during the class I attended).  I was right.  The class is really enjoyable for little kids, but to me, it seems a lot more about meditation, singing, and chants and mudras rather than what I typically consider yoga.  That could be my limited exposure though.  Still, Snatnam has a beautiful voice and is a beautiful teacher.  My 9 year old and just turned 3 year old all enjoyed it.  I loved many of the songs, especially the affirmation-inspired ""I am Happy, I am Good"" as well as the ""Sa Ta Na Ma"" meditation/song, the ""Aadi Shakti"" meditation/song, and the ""The Sun Shines on Everyone"" song.  (Note: I'm calling them based on what I heard the most, I don't know if it's their real name.)

I liked how they had subtitles for the chants/songs...but wish they had done this with the English words as well...not just the sanskrit (I'm assuming that's the language used...but I could be wrong).

I'd love to see another video by Snatnam targeting kids but with more actual asanas in it.  Still, I think there is a lot of benefit to beginning or ending your (and your child's) day with a DVD like this.

The DVD had three language options...English, Spanish, and German for those who might be interested.",1377475200,,1585,4.610714285714286
3622782,4,B001H5108I,The yoga incorporation and religious songs/mantras are wonderful.  The tunes and hand motions are great and my kids have really picked up on them.  If there is a critique to be made it is that this DVD program moves a pit too slowly for the preK and early elementary audience.  We are often advancing the DVD to keep kids settled and moving forward.,1370995200,,349,4.507936507936508
3622783,5,B001H5108I,"We begin each day with this dvd! Somedays she just sits and sings with everyone and other days she is up and doing the Kundalini. Either way, it's a fantastic way to start a day! Positive all the way...",1362355200,,202,4.205128205128205
3622784,5,B001H5108I,"I didn't even know who Snatam Kaur was when I ordered this based on ratings. What a pleasant surprise to realize it was the Kundalini yoga I had recently fallen in love with myself, thanks to a masterful teacher nearby. I bought the girls 2 pink yoga mats and this DVD and they wanted to do the whole thing a couple times a day when I visited for 2 weeks. I do agree with Kaia that one remark this lovely peaceful pregnant woman makes is not appropriate. My granddaughters loved the ""adventure"" story, the songs, the poses, the running around.  They especially were attracted to the other children in the DVD, deciding each time who they liked the best.  Get this video and do it with your own children or grandchildren.  You will love it and feel happy and healthy.",1321833600,2,766,4.457142857142857
3622785,4,B001H5108I,"I really enjoy this DVD, and I hope my two year old will when she is a little older. My only concern is if it will keep her attention, or if it is too long. We shall see :-). We listen to the soundtrack often so she knows the songs and mantras already and I hope that helps. I love Snatam Kaurs music, it calms the whole family down...even my three month old.",1311811200,,359,3.9315068493150687
3622786,3,B001H5108I,"Overall this is a lovely DVD. The music is beautiful and the story has many nice lessons in it, such as overcoming fear (Shanti meets a fierce cobra who is really just reflecting Shanti's own fear back to her). There is a pretty good mix of yoga movements and meditation for younger kids, although as another reviewer noted, many of the movements are focused on the upper body and to me do not seem as relevant as they could be (simply waving hands/arms, etc). Occasionally the way Snatam addresses the ""boys and girls at home"" is a bit awkward.

The main reason I am giving this DVD only 3 stars is because in the part of the story where Shanti follows a butterfly and the children are doing a butterfly pose, Snatam says straight into the camera, ""Oh my God! You're going off the ground! You better not tell you parents about this!""

First of all, I don't think it's appropriate to use the name of God in this way. Secondly, one of my main focuses as a parent is developing a relationship with my children in which they feel free to tell me about anything, and hearing this statement in the DVD was very disappointing. Thirdly, why would my kids not want to (or why shouldn't they) tell me about imagining flying up to the sky as butterflies?  Because of the way the camera zooms in on her face at this moment makes it very difficult to simply ignore, and unfortunately, it almost ruined the entire DVD for me.

As a final note,  my four year old enjoyed watching, and followed along for part of it, but found it hard to follow along with some of the chants. I think it got a little long for her, as well.  My two year old joined in a bit, too.",1311638400,17,1646,4.310679611650485
3622787,5,B001H5108I,I just love Shanti the Yogi.  It's a favorite of my grandchildren (5yrs old).  I give it to my grandmother friends for their grandchildren!!,1297814400,,140,4.791666666666667
3622788,5,B001H5108I,"The songs are absolutely beautiful... I have great fun singing and chanting and yogaing with my 3 kids. It's a simple, but great story to lead kids through yoga poses, although I would appreciate more if more yoga movements are included, rather then so much upper body arms movements.
Anyway, not one dvd is perfect, each one has it's uniqueness, and i am very happy with this one. It is one of the first 2 out of 10 so far.",1297641600,,424,4.3125
3622789,5,B001H5108I,"This is a great introduction to yoga for young children. The format is that of a children's yoga class with several students, Snatam Kaur being the teacher, and the class consists of Snatam Kaur telling a story, which is accompanied by short illustrated (not animated) segments, and the story is tied in with yoga practices such as chants, poses and fun exercises. My daughter is 4, and this was perfect for her because she did not feel pressured to participate (making her shy) as she might have in a class setting. She eased into doing more and more of the practice each time she watched, becoming more comfortable and confident with it each time.

The music is great (my daughter LOVES ""I am Happy, I am Good"") and Snatam Kaur has an absolutely beautiful voice.

The focus is very positive: finding strength, peace and happiness within one's self. References to god are non-denominational, so this would be suitable for any religious background.",1273795200,9,948,4.845679012345679
8307811,5,B001H5108I,"Such a lovely video. It's a story, with songs and yoga. It's very calming and my daughter says it makes her feel calm and happy. She will spend time with this video first thing in the morning when waking up and again when she gets home from school. She sits alone on the floor and follows the songs and hand movements. I love that she loves this :) The only thing is, she will not share it with me! ""mom, this is my ALONE time!"" :)",1522713600,,431,4.023255813953488

8307814,4,B001H5108I,"I like this video.  My 2 year old might be still too young, but I saw him doing some of the postures.  It's about a girl Shanti who makes a journey up a mountain.  It's by Snatam Kaur, who is popular in the Kundalini yoga world, and has some KY CDs (a lot of songs from her CD Feeling Good are in this video, which you can find on iTunes).

It shows a live class with Snatam Kaur telling the story to 7 7-10 year olds (ideal range prob kids 4-10).  It's 70 min long, and in 3 languages - English, Spanish, Dutch.  Includes pictures from a storybook  wish I had the storybook to show in class.  Songs include references to God so some may feel it is religious (in KY they teach God is within you).

I summarized video:

Introductions: Sat Nam my name is _______________.

Once upon a time, there was a girl named Shanti.  And behind her house was a big, beautiful mountain.  And she asked her mom if she could climb up it, and she always said not until your older.  But one day, her mom said she could go today.

She said you can go if you remember to do 3 things:  1) your morning yoga practice 2) remember to do your meditations 3) remember the songs weve been learning in case you run into any trouble on the walk.

Shanti started off by tuning in  Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo, which means I bow to that divine wisdom within me.  Palms in center of chest, in easy pose, sitting straight.  Chin in a bit.  Close eyes.  Inhale to begin.  3x.  Inhale, hold breath, and exhale.  Relax hands.

Shanti started off with her morning yoga practice so we are going to do the same.  Left hands up in the air. Left leg out and right leg at thigh.  Reach for toe, shin or knee.  Inhale up and exhale down.  Stretch and hold.  Exhale down.  Switch sides.  Inhale Sat. Exhale Nam.

Both legs out, shake legs like popcorn.

Rock pose.  Take fists and hit legs  feels like a rock.  Hands on knees and do camel ride.  Imagine going for ride on camel.  What color is your camel? Hold last one.  Relax

Pretend you are a puppet.  String holding shoulders.  Shoulders up and down.  Lets hear your breath.  Go a little faster after a minute.  Inhale, hold up.  Relax

Imagine you have a pencil at the top of your head and someone said to draw a circle in the sky.  Really big neck rolls/circles.  How big is your circle?  Switch directions.  Inhale center.  Hold breath.  Relax

Shanti finished her morning stretches and so have we.  She was ready to go up on the trail.  She sang one of her favorite songs I am happy, I am good.  Sing this anytime you want to feel better.  Stand up and march.  Fingers pointing (I am happy, I am good).  Prayer pose raised up (Sat Nam, Sat Nam, Sat Nam, G).  Hands released in air.  Roll hands down (Wahe Guru, Wahe Guru, Wahe Guru, G).

Suddenly Shanti stopped.  Because she saw a big cobra on the trail.  She didn't want to run because she was too close to the snake.  Lie down and come into cobra pose, with shoulders pulled away from ears.  Hiss like a snake.  Lets hear those cobra sounds.  Inhale, hold breath in, exhale and slowly lower self down.

Come into easy pose.  When she first saw the snake, she was scared.  And the snake was scared too.  So she sat down very slowly, and put her hands in gyan mudra and put her hands by her knees.  And she began to think of the song I am happy, I am good.  Hear the song inside your head.  Can find song on Itunes from her Feeling Good album. (4 min, 32 seconds)

When Shanti opened her eyes, the snake was gone.  When Shanti first saw the snake, she became frightened, and the snake was also frightened because they can feel what we feel.  As she meditated and became calm, the snake became calm too.  So he let her bee and slithered off to the forest.  Slither your hands curving into forest.

She continued on her trail, and a beautiful butterfly ran in front of her face.  It was so beautiful, with lots of beautiful colors.  She followed it because it was so pretty.  Come into butterfly pose.  Bring knees up and down as butterfly wings flap up and down.  See if you can get yourself up off the ground.  She followed the butterfly through the bushes, off the trail.  The butterfly went over the creek, so Shanti went too.  She just followed the butterfly to a meadow filled with yellow flowers.  The butterfly landed on a yellow flower and it took a sip of the nectar (take a sip  lets hear it).  Bend down and pretend sip from flower.

Stretch legs out and popcorn.

Easy pose.  Shanti looked around and she realized she didn't recognize a thing.  She was lost. Nothing seemed familiar.  But she remembered something her mother told her, if you are scared, you might not be breathing correctly.  So she put her hands in gyan mudra and took 10 deep breaths.  Close eyes.  Inhale Sat.  Exhale Nam.

Bring hands in air and shake.

After Shanti did the meditation, she felt much more calm.  She remembered a special chant her mom taught her Gobinday Mukande.  Rock back and forth.

Arms scoop up, 2x.  prayer at top of face.  What pose.. Circle wrists up.  Hands in a fist by sides . Fist up at top of head. Wave hands down.  To song Gobinday once it speeds up.  (Full song is 9 min, 35 sec)

Once Shanti did the Gobinday chant, she was able to think more clearly.  So she began to look around.  She saw trees that she recognized.  Then she saw the creek and jumped back over the creek she hopped over.  Then she went through the bushes she came through.  She then thought  what if a big bird landed in front of me and lifted me up to the mountain?  What do you think happened.  The bird asked Shanti Do you want a ride to the top of the mountain  So she hopped on.  Come standing.  Fly around the room in a big circle.  She saw the ocean while up on the bird and she could even see her house.  She saw the whole forest.  Lets fly back to our places.  Let Shanti off your back.

Shanti says to the bird Thank you so much  The bird says your welcome and he flies off.

How many of you have been to a top of a mountain?  Shanti was so happy she made it to the top of the mountain.  She remembered something her father did when he came to somewhere beautiful.  Sa Ta Na Ma meditation.  Sit up straight like Yogis. Chant, silent, whisper.  To her song Sa Ta Na Ma off her album Feeling Good Today, which can be found on Itunes.  (5 min, 46 sec)

Hold breath in.  Feel all the things you are grateful for in your life. Stretch arms up in the air and shake arms out.  Relax arms out.

Shanti was sitting on this mountaintop and she felt so peaceful.  She looked out into the valley and saw dark clouds forming.  What happens when you see dark clouds?  So it started raining.  Lets make little raindrops  tap floor with fingers.  Now its raining more  use hands.  Heavy rain  harder.  Sound of thunder.

Shanti realized she better go to shelter fast.  She found huge leaves.  She build a shelter out of these large leaves and rope.  She went inside and was tired after going up the mountain and getting stuck in the rain.  So she relaxed.  Lie on back and be very still.  Tell your feet to go to sleep.  Tell legs to go to sleep.  Tell hands to go to sleep.  Tell belly to go to sleep.  Tell shoulders to go to sleep.  And face muscles.  Go to sleep.

Lets wake up like yogis. Roll wrists and ankles.  Rub palms together and soles of feet together.  Do cat stretches to each side of body.  Like a kitty waking up.  Cats are great stretchers.  Helps your spine to be healthy.  Bring knees to chest and rock yourself up.  Massages spine.

While Shanti slept, a big bear came into her shelter and snuggled up next to her.  The bear began to snore.  Lets make the sound of a snore.  The bear woke up too when Shanti woke up startled.  He said don't worry, Im a nice bear.  Do you have any honey?  She had honey candies so she handed to bear.  The bear said thank you so much for the honey and shelter.  I want to share some songs with you.  Sun shines on everyone song with movements (song is 8 min 17 sec).  (Arms up to sun movement, and waves down, fingers pointing).

Visualize all the children of the world, all animals and plants and all living beings.  Lets sing Peace to all, Life to All, Love to All (in song Sun Shines on Everyone).

Inhale and exhale.  Relax hands on knees.  The bear says to Shanti Id like to teach you one more song Adi Shakti with arm movements.

Shanti says thank you to the bear.  It wasn't raining anymore and they both went back into the forest.  She took down the leaf shelter.  She headed home because it was getting dark.  She danced the whole way down the trail.  Dance anyway you can to have fun.  (I am the Light of my soul song playing  song is 5 min, 26 sec on CD).

Come sitting.  Time for closing song Long Time Sun  Blessing for all the people we love, all the people of the planet. (2 min, 41 sec song)

(All KY classes began with Ong Namo and all end with Long Time Sun song).",1469664000,,8877,4.204559088182363
