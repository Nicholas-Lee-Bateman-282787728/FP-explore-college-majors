7900624,3,7885727513,"A young woman loses her husband partially due to the recklessness of privileged ne'er-do-well. She then loses her sight in an accident partially due to the same man. The man changes his life in devotion to her thereafter. The 1935 version of this film is a softer, sweeter and faster-paced movie. Its a warmer and more sensitive presentation with better acting. This 1954 version is in color, slower-paced and more highly charged. It also has a lush soundtrack. The acting is uneven(Im not a Rock Hudson fan. Hes wooden, detached, inauthentic and unrealistic as a kisser.) Barbara Rush is also weak in this film. This version just doesnt have the quality and level of performances that the 1935 version has. I, obviously, prefer the earlier version of this movie.",1479254400,,763,4.922480620155039
