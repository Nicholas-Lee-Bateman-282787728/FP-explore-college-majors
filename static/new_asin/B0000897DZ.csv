1831205,5,B0000897DZ,"My 2 year-old thoroughly enjoys Caillou, and especially enjoyed watching this particular DVD, which features more of Caillou interacting with his little sister Rosie.  Regarding some comments by others:  I heartily disagree with those who claim Caillou is a whiner or bad role model for children.  He is simply a child voicing the joys and frustrations of learning about his world and his emotions.  A child is not an adult and should not be expected to act like an adult.  It is important for children to feel that their emotions are understood and taken seriously, and it is important for the adults in their lives to properly support and respond to their needs (and provide discipline in a loving and patient manner).  No, Caillou's parents do not hit or physically discipline their children, nor should they!  Hurting a child physically does not teach them anything except that it is okay to hurt another person physically.  It teaches them fear and mistrust of the people who should be providing them with the trust and security they so need and deserve.  I think people who take the physical discipline route do so because it is much easier than the time and attention it takes to properly discipline a child.",1172016000,5,1215,4.830917874396135
1831206,5,B0000897DZ,Caillou is the most adorable little boy out there.  Our family adores Caillou it's almost like he's an extension of our family.  We love all the adventures he has and I particularly like how he treats his baby sister Rosie.  He can't stand to hear her cry and really watches over her. This a wonderful show for any collection!,1166572800,3,326,4.491525423728813
1831207,1,B0000897DZ,"Although Calliou may be appropriate for teaching some aspects of children's growth, I have to agree with the speaker who said that he essentially teaches children to whine and complain when they don't get their own way. Although, in today's ""If you spank/discipline/forbid your children anything you're a horrid monster"" society, I'm sure he and his eternally ""Now Calliou...."" parents are the wave of the future. Let the parent beware!

** Since writing the above review, PBS has altered the format of its show, and Caillou seems to be much less whiny and the parents a little more discipline oriented. Perhaps there's hope!",1142121600,8,625,5.067961165048544
1831208,5,B0000897DZ,"My son is 2.5 years old and has had this DVD for over a year. He didn't get interested in it until recently when he's really understood what being a brother and sister means. My daughter is six months old, and now when the ""Big Brother"" song comes on, he goes over and hugs his sister. The video also shows how to play together and share toys - a very big thing in our house right now! Very Cute!",1109721600,5,396,4.025316455696203
1831209,5,B0000897DZ,"Caillou has been a life saver. My 19 month old daughter absolutely loves this show. It is so cute and fun to watch. Unlike the review below, Caillou is so harmless!! How pathetic to absolutely ban CAILLOU from your home. To the person who wrote the bad review, to allow a DVD to set example for your kids! Come on now, sounds like your household is raised on videos only!",1101859200,4,371,4.314285714285714
1831210,5,B0000897DZ,"This DVD is excellent for good behavior. I have a 2 year old boy and a newborn girl. The boy was really gelous about the baby and with this DVD he starts to help me with his baby sister. I prefer to put the DVD than the TV, because Caillou is better than other characters in the TV, he teaches values and respect.
In addition, my son is practicing english, because we live in Mexico and he listens and speaks more spanish than english.",1084233600,4,435,4.190476190476191
1831211,4,B0000897DZ,"Caillou is great for helping kids put words with their emotions and express them. My mildly autistic son watches intently as Caillou goes about his daily life, and uses words to express what he needs and is feeling.
I do not think Caillou is whiny or disrespectful at all. The person who said that he was must have robot kids, or very unrealistic expectations of how children should act. What a great way to raise perfect, passive aggressive children: never, ever allow them to express anger or frustration, or an opinion of their own. Sound healthy to you? No, me either.",1077926400,8,572,4.673267326732673
1831212,5,B0000897DZ,"I'm no child psychologist so I'm not going to try and determine whether or not this DVD is appropriate for your kids. Rather I'm just going to pass on this observation: Both my kids (ages 1 and 3) love watching this DVD; the oldest has watched it so many times that he even mouths the words as he's watching it (because he's memorized what's going to happened next). I suspect he finds this DVD so riveting because the story lines are so close to his reality (for example; having to share a toy with a younger sibling, or needing daddy to fix a toy). Irrespective; I've not noticed a change in his behavior when watching this DVD (unlike a Video on Monster trucks we once made the mistake of renting), and personally have no qualms letting my kids watch this show.",1064707200,24,764,4.425531914893617
1831213,1,B0000897DZ,"If you're interested in teaching your child how to throw temper tantrums and how to whine when they don't get their way, look no further.
This DVD, just like the Caillou show on cable, is a horrible example for small children. I banned Caillou from our house after a week of our two small boys (ages 2 and 4) watching the show and then emulating Caillou's behavior. Too many examples of ""I don't like that"", and ""I don't want to do that"" (add Caillou's whiney brat tone and foot stomping for the right effect). And yes, it was from watching Caillou because they didn't do that before they watched the show, and they stopped doing that shortly after they were no longer exposed to Caillou.
I really don't see what parent's enjoy about this show. It's never allowed in our house again. There are plenty of ""GOOD"" kids shows that don't teach a child how to misbehave like Caillou. The creators of Caillou should be ashamed of themselves.",1062201600,9,934,4.565476190476191
1831234,4,B0000897DZ,This was purchased. for preschoolers. The episodes are great but have a lot of puppet activity in between. Another disk had just episodes of the show which in my opinion is better.,1401926400,,180,4.65625
1831235,3,B0000897DZ,"My kids enjoy watching Caillou, but this DVD has skits of the puppets (Gilbert, Rexi) which they do not like.  These skits are a bit long and everywhere on this DVD.  I have to fast forward those parts.  Other than that, it's a good DVD.",1365292800,,237,4.222222222222222
1831236,5,B0000897DZ,I love Caillou he's a great little fella with a lot of good family learning experiences with his baby sister,1364947200,,108,4.45
1831237,2,B0000897DZ,"My 2 yr old absolutely loves Caillou but she does NOT like this one. If I put it on she tells me ""NO Caillou"" as she would rather watch something else then this particular DVD. The pupets of 'Rexy, Gilbert & Teddy' and the other informative 'commercials' with the kid actors show more then the Caillou episodes.",1364515200,,311,4.473684210526316
1831238,5,B0000897DZ,My son like cailou because he learns from him.  I my self like it because teaches him how to do things.,1356220800,,103,3.9047619047619047

1831240,3,B0000897DZ,"The Grand Kids love it. All the Girls want to watch is Cailou, so if it holds the attention of a 5 year old, a 3 year old and a 18 month old than I say it is good.",1348099200,,163,3.2051282051282053
1831241,2,B0000897DZ,"This item is listed as having French audio available.  However, there is only English available.  I bought it for the reason that it did offer French.  I am not sure this is worth the trouble of returning.  Just an FYI for anyone else buying this for multiple languages.",1346976000,,270,4.5625
1831242,5,B0000897DZ,"This item was exactly as described, arrived within the time limit and my toddler was very happy with the DVD since he has a brother.",1327622400,,132,4.32
1831243,3,B0000897DZ,"I bought this particular Caillou DVD for my grandson, age 3 years and 8 months. Although the Caillou segments were cute, my grandson became frustrated ""waiting"" for Caillou segments with all the annoying puppet shows in between. There were also a couple of songs involving children.
I'm not sure why there was all this other stuff in between. Maybe to make the DVD appear longer? Regardless, if you are willing to fast-forward through all the puppet shows after each Caillou segment, then it's a cute DVD.",1319155200,,505,4.883720930232558
1831254,2,B0000897DZ,"My granddaughter was very disappointed with this gift - she enjoyed the Caillou segments very much but did not like the puppets! Made me fast forward every time the puppets came on.  Not very satisfactory.  Makes me worry about ordering other Caillou DVD's for fear they will have the puppets, too.",1293580800,,298,4.823529411764706
1831255,4,B0000897DZ,My kids are 1 and 2 and they both love this dvd.  The dvd was in very good condition.,1280102400,,85,3.473684210526316
1831256,4,B0000897DZ,"Again, my son loves Caillou, but those puppet segments are too long and neither of us can stand them!",1241654400,,101,4.368421052631579

1831258,3,B0000897DZ,"It's Caillou. It's all about being nice when you don't feel like it when you're a preschooler. My kid likes it. It's touchy feely in the special Caillou way. No annoying Teddy, Gilbert and Rexy dolls - just straight up Caillou. This might be good if your kids are having issues.",1235606400,,278,4.470588235294118
1831259,3,B0000897DZ,"My granddaughter absolutely LOVES Caillou.  This video however, intersperses the animated segments with ""live"" puppets.  A turtle, cat and one other one.  She does not like the puppets and wants to see Caillou.  So she does lose interest the minute the puppets come on.",1235347200,5,269,5.045454545454546
1831260,5,B0000897DZ,As a mother I think all Caillou DVD's are acceptable for ages 2 and up. My daughter loves Caillou and now my 7 month old loves him too. Everyone that I have talked to have said their kids go through the Caillou faze and then onto something else. It's a great DVD and would highly recommend it.,1231804800,2,293,4.157894736842105
1831261,5,B0000897DZ,"All the Caillou videos are adorable. They are short and keep the attention of preschool age little ones. The stories are current and, while they tell a story, the kids are entertained while they are getting a lesson in life. And Caillou's parents are so supportive - a lesson some parents need to learn.",1216339200,,303,4.62962962962963
1831262,4,B0000897DZ,This purchase I made for my daughter as caillou is her favorite character and she like this very much. Worth buying...I recommend...,1207699200,,132,5.045454545454546
1831263,2,B0000897DZ,"This is one of the older Cailou movies.  It has the puppets in it that the kids tend to dislike.  Cailou is pretty whiny in this DVD too. (Not like the more recent ones where Cailou is super sweet).  My son (two and a half) loves Cailou and loves this video, though I think I will limit the amount of time he watches it.  I think he can notice the difference in Cailou's behavior too.  He gets a very serious look on his face when Cailou is misbehaiving.  I reinforce that Cailou shouldn't act that way to teach him that it is not acceptable.  I'd say try one of the newer Cailou movies. Read the other reviews to be sure that it is the newer movie; don't go strictly on the year of the video.  Some are newer versions of the older movies.",1196294400,41,739,4.118881118881119
