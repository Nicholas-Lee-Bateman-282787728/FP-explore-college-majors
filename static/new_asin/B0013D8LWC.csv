I particularly liked the clarity of the diction -- every word was reasonably easy to follow.  The images are clear; the sound was also clear.  The play moves along and I found myself immersed in the production.  It was hard to dispell the image of Mr. Guiness as Obi Wan Kenobi.  He used a vocal range and tone similar to his famous Star Wars characterization, but I felt that his interpretation of Malvolio one of the best I have seen.",1336694400,7,597,4.584905660377358

Orsino had THE worst wig. Olivia didn't seem to mourn for her brother at all. The only two characters I cared for were Festes and Malvolio. I won't watch it again.",1288310400,4,317,4.482758620689655
3104064,5,B0013D8LWC,"Twelfth Night is Shakespeare's last comedy (as such), bridging directly into the tragedies -- most especially into King Lear, in which the Fool sings precisely the song Feste sings in Twelfth Night, but with such bottomless bleakness. This production of Twelfth Night is a joy for those who want to experience Shakespeare performed with the complexity and depth he wanted. First, Sir Alec Guiness, Sir Ralph Richardson, Dame Joan Plowright, and the leading musical theater performer, Tommy Steele. Casts do not get better than this, even if you quibble with interpretations, which I do. But without doubt this is the best Twelfth Night ever filmed, bar none. Second film allows Viola & Sebastian to be played by the same person, Joan Plowright, as both man and woman. Third, Alec Guinness' performance of Malvolio, like great wine, gets better and deeper each time you see it during the decades that have passed since the John Dexter production was made. Fourth, the music is melodic, albeit completely mismatched to the profound lyrics of the Fool's songs. Fifth, the pace is brisk, the script well edited (if editing Shakespeare is ever justified). The only major fault in the production, and it is a big one, is that the comic characters Sir Toby Belch, Andrew Aguecheek, Maria and Fabian are never, ever funny. They are especially out of step with Shakespeare's intentions which, for Sir Toby and Sir Andrew, require commedia dell'arte skills in pratfalls, drunken reeling, gastric distresses, and all manner of ancient classic comedy technique so perfected in our time by Keaton, Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, Red Skelton, Jackie Gleason, Art Carney. This tradition dating to earliest Greek Comedy died when vaudeville veterans died. No one today can do it, or even tries to do it. The major disappointment is Ralph Richardson's Sir Toby Belch, who is supposed to be as fat and funny as Falstaff from moment to moment. Granted he is also a wicked conniver with deep Iago striations, but Richardson looks like a feeble skinny old turkey, his famous diction unintelligible, his physicality geriatric. Audiences are supposed to look forward eagerly to the clown scenes to alternate with the fulsome romantic wittiness of the Plautine plot. I am constantly downed in spirit and fun whenever Richardson is on screen:-- which is unforgivable, especially when it is needed to set up Guinness' absurd puritanism and self-love. The famous ""Letter Scene"" is performed magnificently by Guinness, with the clowns utterly ruining what should be side-splitting counterpoint. A pity, since Richardson was accounted a great Falstaff (I can't believe it on the basis of this performance).

But these are flaws, not fatalities of the sort that plague most new productions of Shakespeare. Buy this film, love it, watch it every 10 years, and notice how much you have grown.",1285891200,6,2854,5.1113490364025695

Joan Plowright is, by far, my favorite Viola/Cesario. She's convincing in both roles (and, compared to many other Violas, you can believe she might pass as a teenage boy). Plowright is equally impressive in the final act, which requires her to add still more subtleties to her performance.

In the broader comedy roles, it's hard to beat a production that includes Alec Guinness, Ralph Richardson and Tommy Steele. (Steele's manic persona, which is not for all tastes, serves him very well here as Feste.)

The outstanding script adaptation abridges the play to about 100 minutes. The decision to reverse the order of scenes 1 and 2 was ingenious: it makes for a more dramatic opening and allows a type of exposition that television can do well but which could not have been done easily on Shakespeare's stage.

The video itself is slightly grainy (presumably a function of its age), and some minor glitches in the quad tape were not corrected. But these are trifles, and the DVD is very enjoyable.

Be aware that this is a stage-like television production: a play produced on videotape. If you want something more cinematic, Trevor Nunn's 1996 film version is very good.",1219449600,44,1362,4.904347826086957

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564-1616) --- Born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564, William Shakespeare was the eldest son of John Shakespeare, a glover, and Mary Arden, the daughter of a wealthy farmer --- The exact date of his birth is unknown, but baptismal records point to it being the same as that of his death, April 23. --- He probably attended what is now the Edward VI Grammar School, where he would have studied Latin literature, and at 18, he married a farmer's daughter, Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, born in 1583, and, two years later, the twin --- Hamnet (who died in childhood) and Judith --- Nothing further is known of Shakespeare's life until 1592, when his earliest known play, the first part of Henry VI, became a hit in London, where he was now working as an
actor --- Soon afterwards, an outbreak of plague forced the temporary closure of the theatres, and he turned for a while to writing poetry --- By 1594, however, he was back in the theatre, acting with the Lord Chamberlain's Men --- He quickly established himself as one of London's most successful dramatists, with an income that enabled him, in 1597, to buy a mansion back in Stratford --- In 1599 he became a shareholder in London's newly built Globe Theatre.

8250214,4,B0013D8LWC,"This is a tale of twins, Viola and Sebastian (both played by Joan Plowright), who are separated by a shipwreck. Viola disguises herself as a man (Cesario) and becomes an attendant to Duke Orsino (Gary Raymond), with whom she falls in love. He loves Olivia (Adreinne Corri), who in turn falls in love with Cesario.  The plot is further complicated when Malvolio (Alec Guinness), Olivia's steward, is tricked into believing that she is in love with him.

This version was directed by John Sichel and John Dexter, and shows both comedy and drama equally well. Guinness is superb as Malvolio, both comedic and tragic.  Plowright, while an excellent actress, is not visually convincing, and this weakens the performance.  The other weakness is the plot itself--too many ends need tying up, and it is done too quickly in the last scene.  Otherwise, this is a delightful performance of Shakespeare's light and enjoyable play.",1526256000,,918,5.0131578947368425

8250222,4,B0013D8LWC,"I have seen no other versions of Twelfth Night, but I have seen many other Shakespearean comedies. This performance has one especially strong virtue and one or two weaknesses.

The strong point is the cast. As others have mentioned, Joan Plowright is superb. What trumps her performance is seeing two giants of British acting performing two clownish roles. First is Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch, who is a drunken, mischievous sot from the beginning, a character out of Falstaff's playbook. Even more fun is Sir Alec Guinness as Malvolio, a stuffed shirt who is turned to the foolish dandy (just a hint of ""Death in Venice"" here). Tommy Steele as Feste seems to burst out of the Shakespearean role of the musician and seems a bit discordant beside the old hands. Since this production was done for TV, I suspect adding him to the cast helped catch a younger audience.

The filming was all done on a sound stage decorated to look very much like a medieval town in a far away place (Illyria, on the Adriatic coast, which might have the romantic flavor of either the Carpathians or the Greek Isles in the 19th century. The scenery was obviously stage grade mockups rather than using real castles. I think I would have preferred the bare stage of the Globe.

The play was shortened, and I sensed that we missed an important sub-plot, when nothing comes of the plot of Viola's lost brother. Among Shakespeare's plays, I would rate it better than ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and not as good as ""As You Like It"", although I have not yet finished watching all the comedies.",1376179200,5,1570,4.681159420289855
