1830518,5,B00008977P,"This is a video of a supurb concert before a hundred thousand people in New Zealand. Russ has two beautiful and talented female guest who can really sing, are both a class act, as is Watson, and make the concert all the better.

I only wish I could get hold of a DVD of Russ's first concert in America, at Trump Taj Mahal. It was also a fabulous concert. Watson is a truly fresh breath of air in the Classical field of music, as well as when singing some of the best pop tunes. His sense of humor, winning, boyish smile, and humble friendliness with the audience win's their hearts and souls in an instant.

Russ has sang before the Queen of England and the President of the United States and he will do so again. Great DVD.",1127433600,14,724,4.239130434782608
1830519,5,B00008977P,"I have always wanted to visit New Zealand.  Now, after seeing Russel Watson's video, filmed in New Zealand, I wish I had been there for that concert.  Fantastic!  His ""guest artists"" were also superb, as were the choruses.  This concert is a ""must see"" for any Russell Watson fans.",1058313600,10,281,4.673469387755102
1830520,5,B00008977P,"First heard Russell singing at the opening of the Commonwelth games in Manchester, was instantly hooked, bought the DVD and enjoyed it so much that I rushed out to buy all the CD's he's made. My wife and I were lucky enough to get two tickets for his live Show at the Birmingham National Indoor Arena, with a middle row four from the front seat, it was a night to remember, the man's a oneoff.
Buy this DVD with confidence, but beware you will get hooked like me.",1052611200,14,463,4.2727272727272725
1830521,5,B00008977P,"When I first heard Russell Watson on CD at my local HMV a couple of years back....I was simply taken away by that powerful, yet emotive factor so reasonant on that voice. Without hesitation, I listened to a couple of tracks from the CD and I was hooked..Volare blew me away and for what seemed like an eternity, I was flying up there with Watson among the clouds ..(felice di stare lassu'...).
This DVD is a gem indeed and a must for all fans. If you have a 5.1 set-up at home, that's even better as Watson's superb vocals emanate beautifully and the surrounds convey the crowded atmosphere of the outdoor concert. In other words, simply a treat as there you have it....your very own front row seat in front of this young tenor. Watson's strong stage presence and charisma is remarkable and he uses his witty charm to good effect. Eg. When announcing the arrival of guest singer Faye Toyser, someone screams crazily from the crowd. Russell appears very amused,throws a glance towards the direction of the culprit and shoots a humorous question,""Do you know me more?"" :)
Unlike the older tenors like Pavarotti and Domingo(who are undoubtedly opera legends themselves), Watson utilizes his youthful energy to good effect, especially during the Volare cue where he does a couple of neat steps(..""Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me"") that will put a smile to your face. Imagine Pavarotti doing a little dance like that?! When he sings O' Sole Mio, you'll be mesmerised by his passionate inflections and energy.
The young NZ guest singer Hayley Westenra is absolutely impressive and when she starts off Pokarekare Ana.... I was absolutely spellbinded by the beauty of her pristine voice that echoed lightly throughout my living room.
Overall, a gem of a concert DVD!!! E' magnifico!!!",1049932800,19,1785,4.875
1830522,5,B00008977P,"This is one of the most exciting ""voices"" I have ever heard.  I have never been a fan of the opera so when I saw and heard Russell Watson preform I was moved beyond words.  The hairs on my arm stood on end!  I knew I had to have this DVD and his CD.  When he talks about ""The Voice"" you know he knows that he is merely the vehicle for this truly amazing gift.  I thank God for The Voice!

1830523,5,B00008977P,"Russell Watson is more than ""The Voice"" he is a phenomenon on stage. His voice is certainly one of the most beautiful that the world has ever heard. He is a gift to the entire planet.
What makes watching him so wonderful, aside from the voice of the century, is the smile that lights up everything; a smile that lets you know that he is having the best time in the world. He clearly loves what he does and it shows, man does it show.",1046304000,19,433,4.105882352941176
1830524,5,B00008977P,"When Russell walks onto the stage of his Auckland concert featured on this DVD, he literally lights up the entirety of New Zealand with him.  He has an amazing stage presence, not to mention an incredible talent and equally diverse voice.  Not even as the concert comes to a close, does he falter and with just as much passion and strength as when he starts.  His love for performing and entertaining people can really be seen in this incredible concert wonderfully captured on DVD.  Because he may not visit the United States and perform, as much as he may England or Australia, I may never have a chance to see him really live.  But because of this incredible DVD, I will, if even for an hour and twenty-three minutes, feel as if I'm there, singing along with him.  There's a great blend of songs from both U.S. albums and two beautiful duets.  His genuine love of singing is something I can't say I've seen in many artists, so if only for that reason, I recommend this DVD to you and hope that you find the enjoyment in it that I have.",1045612800,23,1038,4.403141361256544
1830555,5,B00008977P,Russell's concert is magical that beems you to a great place emotionally. He reminds you what a great voice he has and also a great entertainer.  A great collection to have.,1259971200,,173,4.580645161290323
1830556,5,B00008977P,"The first time I heard Russell Watson sing was when he sang the theme song for the Star Trek series. After that I Googled his name and became a fan.
Fantastic voice whether singing opera or pop....
DVD is great !!!",1246233600,,214,4.2439024390243905

1830558,5,B00008977P,"My wife ""found"" Russell Watson quite by accident.  There was an article in the aol news about him and she was curious.  We listened to a couple of clips on his website and fell in love with ""the Voice"".  This DVD is quite good.  I give it 5 stars because the overall performance is marvelous.  Russell is not only a great singer, he also interacts well with his audience.  As a performer myself, I appreciate that quality in others who can not only entertain, but can also claim the audience as their own through their approachableness.  Russell Watson is very approachable.  He hasn't bought into the ""star"" status that could be his.  He's still just a guy...but with one heckuva set of pipes.  His ability to shift gears is also very impressive; from classical to rock to romantic.  He can do it all with ease and great quality of voice.  Since buying this DVD, we have also purchased a couple of CD's, which are just as beautiful, and having been recorded in the studio, are flawless.  You just can't go wrong with Russell Watson.",1195776000,2,1033,4.548913043478261

1830560,3,B00008977P,"The recording is poor.  The signing comes out well, but the symphony is drowned out and muted.  Hopefully the next one will be better.  This is not his fault but whoever produced the recording of the DVD.  He sounds so much better on CD.",1183161600,,237,4.318181818181818
1830561,5,B00008977P,"Excellent DVD both visually and audibly.  It was a pleasure to finally see Russell perform live.  I was almost wondering if the voice was for real or if it was studio magic.  After seeing this DVD, Russell is the REAL DEAL.  He sounds exactly like he does on his CD's.  What a talented performer!  If the voice doesnt inspire you, his magnetic personality will surely draw you in and entertain you.  I cannot begin to imagine the logistics involved in pulling off such a large scale concert. From start to finish, this is a truly professional presentation.",1175299200,2,556,4.670103092783505
1830562,5,B00008977P,"Since so many others had written in (see amazon.co.uk) about the wonderful production and sound of this DVD - I thought I'd recommend that DOC have his hearing checked. I've heard this DVD on just about every level of audio, and it sounds fantastic on every one of them. That goes for both the stereo and 5.1 available on this DVD.

If DOC were an expert, he'd know that feedback occasionally emanating from the stage monitors (especially in an outdoor show attended by 100,000) will occasionally happen. The stage monitor mixer has a very difficult job tracking the nuances of a singer with such a wide dynamic range. It's not as easy for a performer like Russell to hear himself and the orchestra as a listener might think. An expert would also know that that when feedback happens- it will spill into every microphone on the stage, and thus be impossible to ""edit or mix out"". These ""mistake""sounds are part of any live show - and they are part of the special and unique aspects in live performances captured for all to enjoy, like scars on fine leather.  If DOC were a pro - he'd more likely be congratulating Russell for singing

through those diconcerting moments - instead of nitpicking.  An expert would additionally know that most ""live"" shows are best songs edited together from multiple dates. This show in Auckland was one night only. I suspect DOC should probably stick to Muzak - there are no mistakes, blemishes, or chances taken.

In the meantime I'll continue to enjoy this wonderful show. I'll continue to watch a wonderful performer delight 100,000 people. These same 100,000 people also heard the 3 or 4 seconds of feedback - as the live mixer for the venue could have done nothing to ""fix it"". They still cheered, and demanded multiple encores.",1155427200,8,1765,4.736156351791531
1830563,2,B00008977P,"I've long been a Watson fan and have put off getting any of his live DVDs until now. While the quality of the sound mixing sounds fine on the first track, the rest of the performance has to be some of the worst sound mixing I've heard. At one point you begin to hear some feeback from the stage monitors!

While the vocals can be heard fine, and clear, the orchestra ranges from being hardly heard to sounding just plain muddled. Not only is this annoying, it's just plain unacceptable.

If you're a Watson fan who thinks he can do no wrong, you'll probably be happy with this. There are lots of places where he shows off some personality. If you appreciate fine sounding classical audio this will drive you nuts.",1135468800,4,713,4.435114503816794
1830564,1,B00008977P,"OK, I've been following this Russell Watson ""phenomenon"" for years now, and I have to admit that, on occasion, he's managed to create some alright sounding recordings. However; those were STUDIO recordings, which is precisely why I bought this live concert DVD. I wanted to see what he has to offer outside of the studio and now that I've seen the DVD, I can honelstly say that it's not much at all!

As for the highlights....there weren't any to speak of.

The concert starts with one of my fave Neapolitan numbers ""Torna a Surriento"" but even from the very beginning, he ruins the song with torrid pronunciation, wrong words, and even forgets the second verse. He tries to cover that blunder up by repeating the first verse, but then gets confused and ends up mixing parts of the second verse with parts of the first!!

Then he does an equally unfocused ""Ave Maria"" and takes a break! That's right, he does all of TWO songs and takes a break!

There is much I could note as to why my opinion of this guy has worsened after having seen this, but let's suffice it to say that he's just not very good.

There are some guest ""stars"" appearing with him, but they do nothing to improve this trainwreck.

I will say that he does have a nice voice.....as long as he sticks to the POP stuff that is.

Once he tries the classical stuff he's totally out of his territory.

One last thing. Many of you who are familiar with his previous recordings will be curious about how he did with the ""Nessun Dorma"" on a live stage.

One word. Terrible! Not only is his utter lack of understanding of the Italian language a HUGE deterent, but he sings the aria a half step lower than is written. This is a BIG no-no unless the tenor is beyond his years or vocal peak.....the latter may well be applicable. Except, Watson simply never had the voice to do this sort of music to begin with.

In conclusion, many of you will love this DVD. You will look beyond the linguistic, vocal, and stylistic deficiencies this kid is plagued with, and you will be gald you bought this thing.

Some of you however, will be very disappointed, and perhpas even wish you'd not bought this DVD at all.

If anyone wants my copy, e-mail me.....I'll gladly sell you mine. I certainly won't be watching it ever again.",1131926400,7,2272,4.461352657004831

7980304,5,B00008977P,"Highly competent voice, perhaps a bit too playful on stage, but with very little apparent effort, produces vocal tenor tonality that's very pleasing to a huge segment of vocal music lovers, including me.  Only a few singers have produced specific performances which become the standard by which others efforts are judged.  By my opinion, one of Russell's Barcelona song renditions reached that golden standard height. He has the remarkable ability to vary his vocal tonality so greatly that I expect few people hearing them separately, would guess they were produced by the same singer.  In my case, I prefer what I'd describe as his heroic big voice style.  An old saying says, ""Different horses for different courses.""  Few singers can slide into such different vocal delivery styles as Russell. Watson, matching his intended vocal sound to what he feels best fits each song or part of a song.. I'd love to suggest a few candidate songs for his consideration, given that few other tenors could pull them off so well as he could.  We are lucky to have him.",1472256000,,1057,4.877094972067039
