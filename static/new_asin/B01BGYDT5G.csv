7633451,5,B01BGYDT5G,It may take some time for the public to become aware of this very funny comedy series. I have already pulled other family members into watching the first season with me. I never get tired of laughing and it is all new to them! What a great relief from the usual sitcom stuff.,1458432000,9,275,4.2075471698113205

7633454,5,B01BGYDT5G,"Ahahahah!  This show is the best! I really thought that the pretentiousness would get to me, but the characters develop so well.  They actually show compassion for each other even though they are all highly narcissistic.
All those wanting to see all 3 Seasons need to hop over to Netflix - where they all are now.  Yes, I went there Amazon.  Why are they not all prime here?",1507680000,,374,4.455882352941177

7633457,5,B01BGYDT5G,"Well for starters the two funniest and most comedically brilliant  actors in the English speaking world star in this unbearably funny little situation! Daniel Levy , son of the great Eugene Levy, is the writer  and his sister is a main character as well. It's an ensemble cast , as are all of Chris Guest's mockumentaries. It takes amazing writing AND acting to pull off what they have done. Its no wonder they swept the Canadian awards. I love that all the actors are Canadian and it is shot in Canada ! Go canooks! 20 stars!",1501545600,,526,4.46875

7633460,5,B01BGYDT5G,One of the best shoes Eva! It's so twistingly GREAT! I think the witty humor and sarcasm. Is what I love! My husband barely laughs at American shows (mainly cause he doesn't get all the context not being American) but this is one show where he literrraky can't stop laughing! Thank you!!!,1500854400,,288,4.5576923076923075

I want more but I'll have to wait for when the next season is offered free by Amazon Prime.  This show so reminds me of the quirky ""Northern Exposure"" from back in the day.  Schitt's Creek, though, is more of a comedy. What a blast!  More please!",1499126400,,362,4.538461538461538

7633467,5,B01BGYDT5G,"Just as funny as season 1, season 2 continues to bring us the Rose family and there ""one after another"" problems of being forced to live a life in which they were so unaccustomed - from riches to rags if you would - and their quest to achieve those riches which they think make life worth living.  A small town with all the zany quirks of the townsfolk bewilders, riles up and tests their resolve to get out of town and back to the big city.  It's just that for each attempt, there's always several wacky problems that pops up and keeps them in this town they wish to escape from - even though the father had purchased the town for his son as a practical joke.

7633484,4,B01BGYDT5G,"When I looked at the title of the series, I thought this will be a low class series, in it for the laughs. Well, yes, laughs are plenty, but this series has a good background story. This series seems to have the entire Levy family as characters, and, they are all quite good.

Eugene Levy is the patriarch, Johnny Rose. He is a self made man earning millions, until he lost everything. His wife, Moira, played by Cathetine O'Hara was an actress appearing in soaps, and she is actually very funny. Down on their luck, with their two children, Alexis, played by Anne Murphy, and her brother David, played by Dan Levy. Alexis is the play child,who follows her mother's fancy of 'things'. They all mean a lot, name brands and all. Dan, appears to also live Things, but he is much more reasonable. So, here they are living in a small motel, Schitt's Creek.

Storylines come and go, but always with humor and good manners. Johnny is a very reasonable man, thankful for everyone, and trying to figure out what happened to their lives. The rest of the family tags along, hoping for a change. Humor us well placed, but there is always a serious side to the issues. Certainly a play on words, but fun to observe.

7633492,5,B01BGYDT5G,"I ADORE this show.  It grows on you.  Even though it's goofy and absurd, the characters seem very real.  I love these people, I'm rooting for them.  Perhaps the most bizarre of the bunch is Catherine O'Hara's Moira, the mother.  A comedic tour de force for O'Hara- I don't think I've ever laughed so much at a character or TV show (well, perhaps at SCTV, Levy and O'Hara's alma mater, or In Living Color), but this show continues, with the characters becoming more surprising yet finely drawn with each episode.  I laughed and teared up over the Season 2 finale, wonderful.

I love everything about the show but perhaps most, ***SPOILER ALERT*** the fact that these shallow, shades-of-the-Kardassians characters adapt and evolve over time- spread their wings, expand their horizons and evince resiliency and resourcefulness in the face of won't and ""deprivation"".  Gone is the elaborate, insular social structure that fostered their paper-thin, self-obsessed ways.  The exigencies of real life, and the goofy but canny denizens of Schitt's Creek don't play that.  The show is irreverent, sexy, close to the bone, preposterous, like the Beverly Hillbillies in reverse, and very incisive as to human nature, even brilliant at times, but almost subliminally so- I'm laughing so hard I barely notice.  For me, in the spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest/dp/B005721W9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest</a>&nbsp;and slightly reminiscent of Christopher Guest's offerings, but simultaneously broader and yet more subtle.  This likely has to do with the pacing of a TV show vs. that of a movie (character development can proceed at a more leisurely pace).  Utterly unique, irresistible.",1490140800,,1745,5.614503816793893
7633493,3,B01BGYDT5G,It was a very close race to winning 4 stars with me...it took nearly the entire first season to grow on me...it's kinda like watching a train wreck with some funny parts.,1489881600,,170,4.34375

I already ordered this in the mature season two , and didn't realize the version I just ordered , was the same except it had the words bleeped out. I didn't realize this until I started watching it.  They should specify in bold mature or not. It is numbered differently from the mature version so watch out. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows , so it can be easy leave forgotten. I don't know who want to order the bleeped out version wasted 20 bucks. I will keep it at five stars because of the mature version that I also own , and love.",1489276800,,652,4.174603174603175

Anyway it's just so funny in a way that's hard to explain. I loved season one and was thrilled when I found season two on Amazon recently. The problem is you can't stop watching it so I went through all the episodes in two short days which left me wanting more of this completely insane series. The writing is great, the story line is wonderful and the characters are just so funny each in their own marvelous way. If you haven't watched this show yet then do yourself a favor and of course start at season one.

7633772,5,B01BGYDT5G,"I gave this series a chance because I am a big fan of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara. I've always thought they were hysterical in all of the Christopher Guest films, so I figured they wouldn't let me down in Schitt's Creek. I wasn't quiet so sure in the beginning, as the first couple of episodes were slow going. In fact, not a whole lot happens from episode to episode, but the interactions between the Roses is where the magic is at. The cast's comic timing is great and it's quiet nuanced humor, but if you're not a fan of ""Best in Show,"" ""A Mighty Wind,"" et cetera, you probably won't like SC. It's basically a fish-out-of-water story, and it's biggest laughs are driven by the fact that the Roses are so outlandish in their inability to understand simple living in small-town America.",1485820800,,792,4.545454545454546

7633854,5,B01BGYDT5G,"Reviewed by Instagram's - @poke420ml  Yes yes y'all, I have invaded Amazon and taken over the ""Review-Waves!"" We were lucky enough to discover Schitt's Creek a month or so ago and this place hasn't ben the same since. FYI - startups don't do so well at work when they are constantly quoting a show and/or laughing themselves into a lump of non-usable/giggly/mumbly silliness. I remember Chris Elliot from his SaturdayNightLive and CabinBoy days(yeah yeah, I'm gettin' old...Amazonians, you'll realize quick that I'm past caring, I'm getting old - dammit - and I HAVE NO FILTER! But that's what is going to make this Amazon stuff fun!!).  Seriously,  WATCH THIS SHOW!!! Amazon has knocked it out-of-tha-park with this one. I have come to think that Dan Levy is one of the funnier people on TV. And Catherine O'Hara is just freakin' great. This character of hers makes me fondly remember her Christopher Guest character

Later days AmazonReview!! We all hope you can join us on Tha 'GRAM and that more seasons of Schitt's Creek soon follow. Be kind!

Father and Son Levy (father and son in the show) have still impeccable chemistry; the daughter is still the adorable spoiled brat she's always been, and the mother channels all matriarchs on TV, from Lucilly Bluth (Arrested Development) to Peggy Bundy. They are absurd, they are hysterical, but more and more they are just human with a depth that eclipses other comedy shows. Really, the only thing missing is a real antagonist, the Rosco P. Coltrane of Schitt's Creek. Whenever the show tries, it ends up making the bad guy/gal adorable after a few episodes.",1485388800,,675,4.777777777777778

Daniel Levy is the comic genius on the show.  He plays well off of the family and the local townies.  Eugene Levy is a natural, Catherine O'Hara plays her part perfectly over the top as only she can do.  Throw in the contrasting town people and you've got a hit.  I can't wait for season 3!

I grew up in a small town, smaller than Schitt's Creek and many of the characters are right on.  My wife owned and operated a jewelry store and came across many clients similar to the Rose family which gave us both very personal reasons to be in stitches.  This is just a good way to escape and to show socioeconomic differences in a light manner that can bring the joy of laughter to one and all.  Many issues are in operation to produce a cohesive bag of humor that shows the power of the human condition when more then buckets of money are at play....enjoy and have some belly laughs, it will look good on you.",1484265600,,713,4.2592592592592595

Placing the wealthy Rose family into the middle of Schitt's Creek is a crazy plot...the entire family is hilarious...the townspeople as well. Great to watch the Rose family grow and slowly figure out that money isn't everything. But the journey along the way is laugh out loud. Example, David taking his designer clothes to sell at a local Goodwill type store like it's a posh boutique. .Hilarous!

Dont' have time to write about why but you'll love Moira's dramatic behavior and Alexis' wild girl antics...their fashion is realy cool....Dad, Johnny Rose is and always has been an expert comedian...and Roland N. Schitt is the icing on the cake.

I mean, there were some funny spots, but overall it wasn't as funny as the first season. Don't get me wrong,though. I will still tune in for season 3 (it looked like there would be one according to IMDB), simply because of Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy. Also, Chris Elliott who I adore while not finding as hilarious in this series as he usually is in just about everything else.

PS: Oh, forgot: The guy who plays Bob (the one that owns the car shop)... HIGH-larious!!!! He is utterly hysterical in his deadpan delivery. Love him.",1484092800,,682,4.590163934426229

Can be really touching sometimes -- just when you think they're moving in for the kill with a punchline, they pull a heartstring instead. Really terrific job by all members of the cast. You can tell they are having a blast on set and that they all care for one another. Definitely takes me back to watching Arrested Development and, of course, SCTV back in the day.
