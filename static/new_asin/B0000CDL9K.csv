1918665,5,B0000CDL9K,"Mostly I prefer to listen to the 80's, my No. 1 choice, but some of the 90's was not bad. R.Kelly was one of my favourite artists at the time. A lot of good music from that guy. This DVD, which includes a bonus Cd, contains all of my favourites by him. Absolutely worth my time and money. Great picure and sound quality, I love it. Though I would have prefered the other version of ""Downlow"", but this does not change my opinion. I have come to love this other one. Get yourself a copy and I promise, you will not regret it. Well done, R.Kelly. 5 stars from me!",1237248000,2,561,4.109090909090909

1918668,5,B0000CDL9K,"I absolutely love R Kelly.  I have all his cds and music, and it's great to have music videos to go along with all them.

My all time favourite is Down Low (it stars Garcelle Beauvais and Michael Clarke Duncan and Ronald Isley).  It's a fantastic song that I never get tired of hearing.  Step In The Name Of Love is also great as is She's Got That Vibe and Bump N Grind.  He's an amazing artist and despite what pre-conceived notions you have of him, his genius mind make him one of the best R&B artists ever.  I love this and you have to see it for yourself too.",1162684800,11,563,4.072727272727272
