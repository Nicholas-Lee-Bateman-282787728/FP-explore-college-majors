8458486,5,B0055OFJ16,Best of the series. Highly recommended to those who have or are going to visit Gettysburg and the Gettysburg Museum of History. Have visited more than once and have enjoyed the museum and talking to Eric Dorr the museum curator and owner.  Anyone interested in the Civil War will more than enjoy this program and the Pickers.,1491696000,,325,4.701754385964913
