8201440,1,B000RMJ5UW,"Will someone please wake the QA on the assembly line up and inform them that ""EL Alamein"" is not the same as ""The Battles For Tunisia""? This is the second time I have received an ""EL Alamein"" DVD case with ""The Battles For Tunisia"" DVD in it...The exact same DVD that is in the ""The Battles For Tunisia"" DVD case.",1362960000,,313,4.233333333333333
8201441,2,B000RMJ5UW,"The commentary does not mesh with the videos or photos.  Repeatedly they will be talking about one type of equipment or a person, but the film or picture will be something else entirely.  For example, while talking about large shipments of Sherman tanks arriving, they show film of M3 Stuart Light Tanks, when talking about Hurricane IIB ground attack fighters, they are showing P 40s and Spitfires, when talking about several squadrons of B25 Mitchells arriving, they show B-17s, when talking about the use by the Germans of captured Russian 76.2 MM field guns, they have film of German 150mm and 210 mm artillery, when talking about General Alexander arriving to take over, the first picture is of General Horrocks, when talking about the US M2 105 Howitzer being delivered, the film is of early war US 150 mm Howitzers.  And so on ad nauseum all through the whole thing, pathetic.",1254441600,4,883,4.8344370860927155
8201442,5,B000RMJ5UW,"I think the series ""Battlefield"" is one of the best ever reviews of WW ll.  Like all of them, this one covers the Leaders, the Equipment, the Men, as well as the battles.  The main battle coered here is the last battle of El Alamein.  The DVD however, covers the period from the beginning of the war in Africa until the end where the Axis is expelled.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat even though you know how everthing ends.",1208563200,6,428,4.182926829268292
