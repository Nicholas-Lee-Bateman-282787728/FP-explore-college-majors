2204988,1,B00078NAXO,"Despite the cast of Ava Gardner and Victor McLaglen this film is poorly scripted, highly fictionalized and filled with sub B movie histrionics.  George Raft's name is featured above the movie's title in the opening credits and undeservedly so. Raft who is probably best known as the Hollywood actor who turned down roles that Humphrey Bogart parlayed into stardom, gives a cliched, wooden, flat performance as Kenny the town tough guy.  Kenny is unemployed and spends most of his time shooting pool, playing cards, and drinking at the town's only nightclub.  His girl (Ava Gardner) returns to town after a 2 year hiatus and again becomes the object of desire for Kenny and the nightclub owner.  This uneven triangular relationship is never fully explored and the characters remain uninteresting objects for a director that seems misguided.  The one informative scene for me was a shot of Raft which clearly shows his shoes with lift heels.  Like Bogart, Raft was insecure about his short stature. When three excellent books about film noir; ""The Dark Side of the Screen"" by Foster Hirsch, ""Somewhere in the Night"" by Nicholas Christopher, and ""Dark City"" by Eddie Muller fail to even mention one line about Whistle Stop you know that this is a dismal film.",1183507200,3,1256,4.957142857142857

I felt so bad for Fran as she not only did not get the guy, but ended up in a hospital bed crying alone. Kenny and the character Mary who have a see saw relationship leave a trail of disaster up until they finally get their act together.

2205012,2,B00078NAXO,"It's not possible to have good film noir without flawed characters, but when you fail to include something that allows the viewer to connect or empathize with those characters despite their flaws, you wind up with Whistle Stop.

Instead of a level-headed everyman or a bumbling but loveable nobody who falls into a trap of seduction or web of intrigue, we get leading character Kenny Veech.  Sure, he's a jobless alcoholic with a gambling problem, but he's also devoid of any flair or charm and his only remarkable characteristic is the uncanny ability to walk into a room and have everyone else in that room enraged within thirty seconds.

This begs the question, of course, as to why Mary (who apparently has no last name), would want anything to do with such a rat. We learn early on, however, that Mary is where the term 'bipolar disorder' comes from.  She'll dump the man she's with the moment another man walks in the room, and she'll dump that guy five seconds later just because she's Mary.

So, instead of characters, we have caricature and instead of a gripping voyage into the dark side of human nature we get farce noir.  I don't blame the actors, they are doing the best with what they have to work with.  George Raft is boxed into a corner, and I'd bet half of the contempt he projects into Kenny Veech is regret from choosing to play such a despicable chump.  It's much the same with Ava Gardner--there's not much you can do with a character who needs more lithium than can be found on the planet she roams.

Other than being a testament to Ava Gardner's impossible beauty and perhaps the virtues of temperance and sobriety, there's little to like in this film. 1 1/2 stars",1449878400,5,1688,4.5813953488372094

He should have been called The Great Stoneface instead of Buster Keaton.  He's terrible, so rigid and stiff.  Thank God he turned down ""Casablanca"" and ""High Sierra"".

2205026,3,B00078NAXO,"WHISTLE STOP is an entertaining but rather dumb 1946 film Noir movie directed by Lonide Moguy and adapted for the screen from the novel of the same name by Maritta M. Wolf. The story begins in the town of Ashbury, which is not much more than a ""whistle stop"" along a Midwestern railway line. Gorgeous hometown girl Mary (Ava Gardner) has returned after two years of living large in Chicago -- ostensibly to arrange the sale of her house, but in reality to see if her ex-flame Kenny Veech (George Raft), a tough guy who refuses to get a job and spends all his time drinking and playing cards. When she sees that Kenny is still small-time, she gravitates to his mortal enemy Lew Lentz (Tom Conway), a suave but shady nightclub owner. This brings to a boil the long-simmering feud between the two, a fact which is not lost on the aptly-named Gitlo (Victor McLagen), a bartender who works for Lentz but despises him. Gitlo proposes that he and Kenny rob and then murder Lentz, and Kenny, eager to score a big payday so he can prove to Mary he's not small-time, readily agrees. Two stark facts interfere with this plan. The first is Mary's discovery of it, which forces her to make a choice between Kenny or Lew. The second, even harder to swallow, is the fact that just because you are plotting someone's downfall, doesn't mean he isn't plotting yours -- or that he may be better at murder than you.

THE CHASE is in some ways typical of the Noir films of this period. It is full of morally ambiguous characters,
and plenty of cheap whiskey, fist-fights, card-playing, and tough-guy/snarky dame dialogue. There is also an unspoken belief that the audience will naturally side with the toughest man and the most beautiful woman, and will genuinely care whether they get what they want, irrespective of how scummy or deficient they are.
The film's assets are Ava Gardner's looks, fairly assured direction, the somewhat unusual take of setting a Noir movie in a small Midwestern town rather than a big city, and a snappy sense of structure (which was lacking from screenwriter Philip Yordan's next movie, THE CHASE). And though predictable at many points, there is an interesting twist about fifty-odd minutes into the picture that had my eyebrows raised because I didn't see it coming as I did nearly everything else. I also particularly enjoyed the smooth, debonair performance of Conway as the bad guy of the piece.

On the debit side...well, let's start with the characters. There is literally no important character in this movie who is actually a remotely decent human being. Mary, our heroine, is essentially a prostitute, who, like all hookers, must by nature side with whoever she thinks is the strongest man in the room -- and since she can't decide who that is, she bounced between Lew and Kenny like a ping-pong ball. Kenny is a worthless layabout who spends all of his time drinking, gambling and playing with the affections of local barmaid Fran (Jorja Curtright), who he discards like a condom whenever Mary walks in the room -- with tragic consequences for Fran. He also distrusts his only actual friend in town, Gitlo. Perhaps this is wise: Gitlo's a would-be murderer and thief who betrays his boss for money because he doesn't like him, while his boss, Lew, is supposedly worse than Kenny because...well, I honestly don't know, but you get the picture. Even Kenny's mom, who seems likeable enough, ruins everything by saying, ""They're all jealous of Kenny because he's more of a man than they'll ever be!"" Really? Kenny, who refuses to work, who won't commit to the one woman who loves him and who treats her like garbage, who slaps around anyone he dislikes, who drinks like a sponge and gambles away his mom's money at cards...Kenny is your idea of a real man?

The plot suffers from a similar issue. Noir is all about moral ambiguity, but the story really revolves around how a failed robbery leads to a revenge plot, which in turn leads to acts of counter-revenge, and so on: I found that hard to care about, especially since the stakes were fairly low. As for George Raft, a cinderblock would have better acting ability -- there is a scene in which he gets shot in the arm, and I swear he looked as if he were falling asleep during the take.

Despite all this, WHISTLE STOP is far from boring. The movie moves at a fairly swift clip, the dialogue is snappy without being memorable, a lot of the acting is good (notwithstanding Raft), and there is just enough unpredictability to make things interesting down the stretch. The idea of exposing the seamy side of small-town America is a fascinating one regardless of genre. I certainly don't regret watching this film, but I do wish a greater effort had been made to make me care whether Kenny and Mary will live happily ever after. Or even live to the end of the movie.",1422489600,,4834,4.67018779342723

2205047,1,B00078NAXO,"NOT REMASTERED.  Very disappointing.  Very poor quality black and white film that look's like it is tinted green all the way through and not sharp at all.

The sound is muffled and the blackground music, also muffled, is too loud and overwhelms the dialogue between the characters, making it difficult to hear exactly what they are saying.  Snapping sounds of static and white dots and streaks appear.  Tops of heads of actors, when standing, are cut off including Ava Gardner and George Raft who was not a tall man.

The movie looks as if the old, deteriorated, film was being shown on a screen while it was videotaped too closely and sometimes, (especially in the opening credits) it is jumpy.

Ava Gardner, one of my all time favorite actors and the reason why I bought this dvd, is beautiful and comes across well, when you can hear all of what she is saying.  George Raft has one expression - sullen.  They are a very mismatched pair and not belieable.  Ava, at one moment, is hot to trot for George and then in the next, she can't stand him, over and over again to the final scene.

The story was slow and B-O=R-I-NJ-G! The video looks like a very cheaply made 30!s or 40!s documentary to teach the viewer a lesson on something antisocial.

There are NO SUBTITLES which are very much needed considering the muffled sound so you don't have to miss something said by an actor that may be important to the plot.  Some very good actors are wasted in this dud.

One song that Ava and George dance to sums it all up, ""Turkey in the straw.""

Although the cover of the case it comes in is very nice (as pictured on amazon), when you look on the back, you can see how little thought was put into manufacturing it.  The fifth line has two words together without a space, ""whospends"".  It really tells you something about the overall quality of the product.

Don't waste your money as I did.  I love film noir, even bad film noir, but this isn't even noir.  I am going to try and return it and get my money back.  I would NEVER recommend this movie to anyone based on its lack of, even average, quality.  It stinks.  Several times during viewing it, I felt the compulsion to shut it off but hoped it would get better, which never happened.

I didn't expect perfection, but I expected a lot better than what I got for the price.  If you like this movie and its quality, you'll love ""Swamp Women,"" one of the worst quality dvds ever.  The quality of this dvd is the same as the worst you can buy in a DOLLAR STORE.

Although I have bought many, many dvds from amazon.com over the years, this ia my first major diappointment.  I just hope my review is listed regardless of how negative I feel about the terrible quality of this dvd and dull story. The name ""Whistle Stop"" and the advertisment made it appear to have great possibilites.  They never materialized. Horrible.",1265155200,14,2863,4.4414587332053745

Hot Toasty Rag, September 9, 2017

Ive always felt bad for George Raft. Rather than joinor beat outthe tree famous gangsters of the silver screen, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Edward G. Robinson, he turned down some crucial roles and was relegated to making B-movies the rest of his career. Sometimes stardom boils down to luck; how was he to know turning down The Maltese Falcon and High Sierra would leave him to make lousy movies like Whistle Stop?

You know those terrible cheesy old movies that sometimes get featured in a modern movie, on television in the background? Whistle Stop is like one of those movies; in fact, I wouldnt be surprised if it was one of those movies. A no-good gambler and a rich nightclub owner fight for the attentions of a materialistic pseudo femme fatale. Ava Gardner plays the supposedly irresistible beauty, but even without my normal dislike for her, she hardly seems worth the trouble she causes. The banter is cheesy and laughable, and the story is guessable and pretty boring. If you really like Ava Gardner and want to watch one of her very first movies, go ahead and rent this one, but if you're just in the mood for a black and white classic, skip this one.",1504915200,,1229,4.658986175115207
8045855,2,B00078NAXO,"I really like the oldies, but both Raft and Gardner can't act a lick in this flick! Corny and disappointing story. Watch it and then tell me I'm wrong. Incidentally, ignore the reviews.",1495497600,,185,4.636363636363637
8045856,4,B00078NAXO,Many young fans are unfamiliar of George Raft's skill as a dancer.  Half way through the movie he shows his smoothness on the floor.  Two thirds through the movie start to become a film showing Ava Gardner and Raft keeping the plot together with emotions.  Victor McLaglen performs to expectations and is a fantastic character actor as well as a leading man in some films.  Tom Conway the proverbial villain does not let us down.  I rate this film 3.5 yet I rated it four stars so not to have this rating drop to a three star.  Film Noir shall always be with us!,1494892800,,562,4.355769230769231
