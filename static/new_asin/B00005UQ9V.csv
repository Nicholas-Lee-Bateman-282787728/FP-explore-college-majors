1666493,3,B00005UQ9V,"All of the performances were good. So was the cinematography. Some of the major themes that were explored were interesting (i.e., loss of a parent, rite of passage and trust). However, there were too many loose ends and unanswered questions. Also, I would have liked to see more of David Morse in the present as opposed to the past.",1001203200,,332,4.6440677966101696
1666494,5,B00005UQ9V,I was very pleased to find that the screenplay was very true to the book.  Anthony Hopkins made an outstanding performance of the mysterious Ted Brautigan.  I found it to be quite entertaining and would recommend others to see it.  My only regret is that it probably would have been too long to incorporate the other interconnected short stories into this movie.,1001203200,,362,4.806451612903226
1666495,4,B00005UQ9V,"Hearts in Atlantis is a well done, clean, emotional movie. It's comforting reminder of our childhood, confusion, and reaching personal triumphs left me very satisfied. The tension in this film comes to a nice point prior to releasing the audience . Casting is excelent.  Directoral direction was well defined without superfluous scenes.  Hollywood can make real movies about life without tired action and sex - and Hearts in Atlantis is the proof.",1001116800,,447,5.194444444444445
1666496,5,B00005UQ9V,"This was an great book, hopefully it will follow in the footsteps of The Green Mile in it's translation to screen.  The themes of the story are starting to echo the current events of the past few weeks.  The rating does not surprise me, many King movies are however this movie should be seen by a broader audience.  I'm also excited to see the last part of the book on the screen.  You have the time so read the book before you see it.",1001116800,,435,4.142857142857143
1666497,5,B00005UQ9V,"Mark another fine film for actor Anthony Hopkins, Hearts of Atlantis is one of the best comming of age films since Stand by Me.(It doesen't hurt that it's by the master Stephen King)King's spins another non horror yarn that is more refreshing than all the summer drab that flooded theater's recently.  This is a very well written, well acted, superbly directed family film that will make you remember your childhood.  David Morris and the young actor playing him are simply spellbinding.  I hope this film get's it's props at oscar time and not some lame over hyped garbage like the contender.  Go see this must see gem!...:)",1001116800,5,625,4.813084112149533
1666498,4,B00005UQ9V,"Yikes, I saw a sneak preview of this Anthony Hopkins film just a few hours ago, and I have not yet been able to tell my friends exactly what it was about.  Primary focus is on childhood, what life offers, and the punishments for those who can really appreciate it.  There is great irony, symbolism, and mistique to this film.  My friend said it would be an ""English teacher's dream"" to teach, for all of its metaphors and devices.  If I cannot say whether the central idea was good or bad, i can at least say that it was moving to the point of disturbing.  The closing voice over narration was beautiful and eloquent, reminding me of emotions stirred up while watching Speilberg's A.I.  Perhaps just Like that movie, I cannot really proscribe a ""good"" or ""bad"" rating  for it.",1001030400,,776,4.5
1666499,4,B00005UQ9V,"I found the easy pace relaxing and the story interesting without being threatening. In fact, for what has happened to our world lately, this movie smoothed away some layers of stress for me. All the smoking was not fun for this ""quitter of a year and a half"" but I know they all smoked in the early 60's. Although I gave it 4 Stars- the big screen and sound are not that important for this film so you could wait to see it at home.
Think- Cider House Rules but not quite that high in quality.",1001030400,,492,4.135416666666667
1666500,4,B00005UQ9V,"I have read the novel, Hearts in Atlantis, and it's clear from the trailer that they will only be doing the first and final segments of that book for the film.
The actors and the scenes in the trailer appear top notch. However, I am afraid that the movie will not be able to do the book complete justice, as a large portion of the novel, which was written in five segments, each one reflecting a different story. Also, the book ties in very heavily, especially the first segment upon which the film appears based, to Stephen King's great opus, The Dark Tower Saga, which, in and of itself, isn't even complete yet. References to that work would either have to be cut or modified.
Ideally, though, Hopkins is an ideal choice to play Ted Brautigan, a man with a secret ability to find the truth in others.",1001030400,2,803,4.4324324324324325
1666501,5,B00005UQ9V,"I previously read this book and it was great! Making a movie of it was a brilliant idea! Although they must have edited a lot of it because there was a lot of use of the ""F"" word (just in case any kids are reading) and a lot of sexual references. It's quite depressing though.(Just a word of advice, hehe.)",997920000,4,306,4.116666666666666

1666548,3,B00005UQ9V,"After reading the book, it was a bit disappointing to see that the movie covered only about a quarter of what the book covered.  Not surprising, of course.  Certain details were also modified to be less ""bizarre"" than what appeared in the book.  Kind of changed the feel of the friendship of the main characters and lost most of the ending to be ""politically correct"".  Well, it was still interesting.",1510358400,,401,4.685714285714286
1666549,5,B00005UQ9V,"A blend of some of my favorite things in life, a good story, a great actor and being able to watch at home. The story is good. It's my favorite author Stephen King, just not in his usual scariness. My favorite actor Sir Anthony Hopkins.",1510012800,,236,4.266666666666667
1666550,2,B00005UQ9V,"Just wasn't for me. Everything was too sketchy; nothing was really developed; children doing unrealistic things. Hopkins was wonderful to watch, as always, however.

1666552,5,B00005UQ9V,"Stephen King thought that movie is one of the best interpretations of his work. However if you are looking for crazed space monsters or spooky girls then this is not the movie for you.

No movie can cram a whole novel into the limited time available and William Goldman, did a great job of picking while still making the story coherent. The funereal scene and ending scene to make a complete story bracketed the ""Low Men"" story. He removed all the supernatural references with the exception of being psychic. Then Scott removed all the supernatural gimmicks and let the actors do their jobs. William removed Kings potty mouth and Scott moves the gory scenes off screen, as viewing these is not necessary to the story.

What's left is ""Hearts in Atlantis."" As with many movies such as ""Thin Man, The"" (1957) by Dashiel Hammett, the movie transcends the writer to become something better then just an animated version of the book. Goldman added a story about a football player to give Bobby Garfield extraordinary stamina when it was needed.

Naturally being a DVD there are all the DVD goodies such as the voiceover commentary that adds annotation and an extra dimension to the story by explicitly pointing out what they just infer in the movie.",1502323200,,1244,4.776744186046511

1666554,3,B00005UQ9V,I probably would have loved this if I hadn't read the books. The movie really downplays the supernatural and whole I was thrilled the movie made it to the big screen I was saddened than they toned down the low men in yellow Coates. Anthony  Hopkins had stellar acting though!,1501459200,,275,4.5

1666580,5,B00005UQ9V,"This is a beautiful film.  And it is very, very deep.  It hearkens back to a more innocent time when a young man with the possibility of greatness is mentored by a great elder who can see his potential.  Sadly, too many Catholic priests and other such betrayers of innocence have all but destroyed our ability to allow our children to be mentored in the way that Bobby Garfield was by Ted Bratigan (the character played by Anthony Hopkins).  Watch this film and mourn for what has been lost but don't give up on the future. Their really are saints among as. Sadly, they are outnumbered today by false prophets, one of whom is about to be inaugurated president of the United States.  I undercased president intentionally because I don't think that Donald Trump deserves to be honored with the sacred role of U.S. President, even tho in two days he'll be put in that office.",1484697600,,872,4.564102564102564

1666627,5,B00005UQ9V,"The movie was filmed in my children's hometown of Staunton, VA and that's the biggest reason - that and Anton Yelchin being in it as a child and seeing such promise for a life cut painfully short.

1666629,4,B00005UQ9V,"While Hearts in Atlantis wasn't my favorite King story, it did tread the line between the two realms he paints best - that of nostalgic and fleeting youth alongside unspeakable terrors - in near perfect form, The movie hits most of the important notes, basically skipping the middle of the novel (and origin of the title) in favor of Bobby Garfield's coming of age and his brief but powerful friendship with Ted Brautigan. Hopkins was an excellent choice for that latter role, and a young Anton Yelchin is no slouch in playing the former. But as well written and performed as the story and film were, the movie falls short when it comes to Ted's mysterious past and ultimate fate. Granted, what the book held in store for him was a little too much to cram into a 100 minute movie with no potential for a Dark Tower film in sight at the time this was made, but it still falls a little flat when The Low Men In Yellow Coats finally make their appearance. Still worth a casual watch for the King completist or someone looking for a slow-burning drama.",1468454400,,1048,4.492146596858639

1666634,5,B00005UQ9V,"Though it departs from the actual novel in numerous ways, this is nonetheless a very solid telling of the Stephen King tale -- with many of the nostalgic beats still intact. It also features a number of strong performances from the likes of Anthony Hopkins; Hope Davis; the always-wonderful David Morse in a heart-tugging bookend appearance that frames the central action; and the amazing Anton Yelchin in one of his earliest roles. Watching an 11-year-old Yelchin go toe-to-toe with Mr. Hopkins is impressive. Tragically, his sweet and sensitive portrayal is all the more poignant in light of the gifted actor's untimely death at such a young age. The tone of this film is bittersweet throughout -- tinged with memories of childhood; shaped by images of a time and place forever gone and out of reach. But the closing shot of this film -- with its moving score by Mychael Danna, and the evocative cinematography of Piotr Sobociski, to whom the movie is dedicated -- will now and forever bring me to tears with the knowledge that we lost the gifted Yelchin much too soon.",1466467200,,1071,4.826086956521739

I usually don't care much for Stephen King stories, but wanted to see this one because Anthony Hopkins always does a great job and I have enjoyed Anton over the years.  He is a little boy in this movie and he is just adorable  The story is weird, like all of Stephen King stories.  The acting is exceptionally good.  One worth watching.  Anton, so young to leave this world.  You will be missed.",1466467200,4,468,4.310344827586207
1666660,4,B00005UQ9V,"This is a nicely written and acted film about the rites of passage in growing up. Bob Garfield attends the funeral of one of his best friends named Sully and also finds out that another very good friend of years past named Carol also had died. The movie flashbacks to when the trio were children. Bobby befriends an older gentleman who boards at his house named Ted Brautigan (as usual, brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins) where Bobby learns that Ted has a wonderful secret talent and so he is being chased by the FBI. An older Bobby recalls the events that led to the beautiful relationship that he had with Ted that changed his life. Bobby's mother whom he lives with also learns a lesson as well. This is a wonderful drama that reminds me in some ways of 'Stand by Me', another King film. However, the two films are very different, they both deal with children and friendship. This is a film that can be seen by most people in the family although there are two scenes involving Bobby;s mother and his friend Carol that may be hard to watch for sensitive viewers. But it is well worth watching and thinking about. It does leave you with a good feeling at the end even with the loss of his friends which brings him to the beginning of the story.

While it has some of King's familiar and winning ""coming of age"" elements, it also has a half-baked plot featuring King's stock issue faceless monsters, aka Regulators or whatever. The movie makers almost completely bury the story of what's chasing Ted and why, which leaves the plot somewhat incomplete. You're left mostly with the coming of age stuff, but none of the child actors are very interesting. Hopkins doesn't do much with his role either; not particularly grandfatherly, or dark, or anything.

1666667,5,B00005UQ9V,A favorite of mine.  Based on a sci-fi novel by Stephen King the screenwriter brings the story into the realm of reality.  It's a story about childhood friends and growing up and finding it's not possible to recapture what was.  Anthony Hopkins plays a man cursed with the gift of ESP and hounded by the post WWII FBI who want to use him to access Russian secrets.  The rewritten story refers to actual paranormal experiments that were conducted by Russia during this period (read Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain - Ostrander).

1666706,4,B00005UQ9V,"I use the word ""Charming"" a lot when I review movies, but this was truly a wonderfully charming movie. Great performances all round. Beautifully shot. Not a lot of high and low points, but that said, there are some points of tension and drama. A very vague and mysterious plot as a Stranger with seeming intuitive powers appears on the scene, and his appearance creates the dramatic tension for the other characters.

Really truly great performances by all the actors - young Anton Yelchin at his best, Anthony Hopkins stunning as the mysterious stranger, equally great performances from Hope Davis and Mika Boorem.",1441584000,,615,4.970873786407767

1666714,4,B00005UQ9V,"Anthony Hopkins is always good and this is no exception.
However, the novel is quite complex, with several inter-related sections all tied to the central idea.
That idea is not easy to grasp, even after finishing all the parts. The action centers around a group of people who come in contact with each other and are all tremendously changed by the experiences.
The novel title refers to, I think, the idea of the sixties, that it was a time of overwhelming change, with hopes of changing the political spectrum, but that is not so easy to do. It requires a change of heart of the entire population, and such things are not easily transmitted, or even accepted as beneficial.
It is tragic in many respects as the story of a loss of hope.
Our hearts may still be in Atlantis, the sixties, the time of immense promise, but when we confront the reality that the era has spawned, we are necessarily left longing, but our hope is essentially gone and we're left to live out our lives with what we have left of the dream, sadly, not much.
The book is stirring, evocative, well crafted. It does contain some fantasy elements, but they are essential to the tone of the story, the theme of abandonment of those fantastical elements that help to spur hope, but promise its defeat in the end.
The book will move you, perhaps to tears, but the movie is like the Cliff's Notes (Spark Notes) version of the novel, leaving out 4/5 of what makes it so appealing as a story. Some things that were kept are completely inexplicable because so much else is left out, making the eventual story muddled and confusing. It is still affecting, but loses much of that effect from the editing/adaptation.
It is only LOOSELY based on the book, to the movie's detriment.
However, if it spurs you to READ the book, you will be so enriched you will not regret this ""introduction"" to hope promised and then unfulfilled.
A tremendous book, a middle of the pack movie.",1437177600,7,1933,4.573487031700288

The casting is excellent, and the acting by Anthony Hopkins is superb--something that I remembered the next day.  I would recommend to anyone but very young viewers (a brief scene of a rape and resulting battery injuries).

1666793,5,B00005UQ9V,"This film is based on one of Stephen King's stories written while he was recuperating from being seriously injured after being struck by a car while walking. This story, along with The Green Mile, take an entirely different tack into the supernatural when compared to most of his other work.

It is uplifting and intelligent. Mr. Hopkins' performance is excellent. It is based around the Red Scare of the 1950s when the U.S. Government, along with the government of the Soviet Union, were engaged in psychic research.

This is a great family film and it will keep intelligent adults interested as well. I waited for the Blu Ray for years but finally settled on this DVD. If it does become available on Blu Ray I'll get it, since the cinematography and location shots, many of which are in Virginia, are beautiful to behold.

Anthony Hopkins gave a brilliant a performance; covert, mystical and very powerful!  The story was psychological and had metaphysical overtones which sucked me into the story and held my attention all the way through the film.  The casting, cinematography and editing was like ""icing on the cake"" and I am very much looking forward to watching it again.  It is now one of my all-time favorite films. - F.

1666884,5,B00005UQ9V,"Hearts in Atlantis  (2001)  Anthony Hopkins, Anton Yelchin, Hope Davis, Mika Boorem

Rated PG13

Tagline: What if one of life's great mysteries moved in upstairs?

A nostalgically melancholic tale about the loss of childhood innocence, with an atmospheric touch of magical mystery. Other times and places and the domain of a lost era stolen by the lurking boogey men, based on Stephen King's writings.
No explosions. No nudity. No profanity.
Unexpectedly sweet and touching, yet a bit haunting.
The early nineteen sixties is the backdrop for this sleepy small town dealing with the issues of coming of age and the bittersweet journey of innocence that always slips away forever from our grasp.
The supernatural and and the shadowy are featured in a strangely enchanting but reflective moodiness concerning a time gone by.
This film is about the forgotten charms of ebbing childhood as much as it is about the mystical realm. It's a precious change from the junky trash entertainment out there.
Quietly exceptional and worth repeated viewings with its wonderfully rich reflections of the early 1960's, including popular songs.
Sadly all summers must end but its not so bad once you've had the best of all first kisses on a Ferris wheel. What's sad is the misty longing for a time that can never be reclaimed,  except for those distant memories that have washed away and dimmed long ago while we weren't looking.

I am a huge King fan and to tell you the truth, just bought it for my collection, BUT being in the middle of Re-re reading Dark Tower 7 found myself thinking of Ted's adventure's more and more often. After watching it again last night I had to re-think my initial reaction. This is a great story about Telepathy and once again , how one person can change a young person's life and way of thinking. Set in the 60's shows an innocence and friendship that is lost on the youth of today. If you are looking for a Horror movie, don't bother. This is just a great story with Hopkins acting ability shining. (Pardon the pun). The movie makes more sense after reading the Dark Tower series, or you may be dissapointed in the ending.

1666929,5,B00005UQ9V,"Having seen this the first time several years ago, i was glad to find it offered on amazon for a reasonable price. The plot is, in my opinion, one that absolutely holds your attention. It is not the average S. King fare, though he has been known to deviate from his usual style here & there (for example, the Green Mile & the Shawshank Redemption). Though children play the major characters, it is not a child's movie, with moments of brutality & some language. I enjoyed this recently as much as I did originally. The actors were quite good; Anthony Hopkins always delivers a solid performance, but in my opinion, the young man playing the lead part turned in just as stellar a performance. Personally, I also always enjoy seeing David Morse in movies, & find his acting enjoyable, whether he is in a lead or supporting role. The ending is somewhat ambiguous, letting you draw your own conclusions as to who the ""bad guys"" truly are. But overall, it is definitely worth watching if you like suspense, blended with a moving human interest story.",1354492800,,1045,4.654054054054054
1666930,4,B00005UQ9V,"Earlier Stephen King movies were almost embarrassing to watch, not this one.

The movie on its own is quite good. Hopkins is solid as ever, the young actor playing Bobby Garfield was especially good as were most of the main actors.  One seldom enjoys the movie as much as the book and often portions of the story is truncated or changed to fit into a time-restricted screenplay.  The book had a tad more fantasy aspect in regards to 'the low men', their vehicles and references to 'the beam' from ""The Dark Tower"" series.  It misses out on how severely cold and dysfunctional Bobby's mother was and how messed up Bobby ends up, which of course makes for a shinier ending in the movie.

The small and larger changes to the story don't necessarily hurt the film at all.  I'd say the book was richer in story while the movie of course winds up with the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending.",1353715200,,888,4.553459119496855
1666931,5,B00005UQ9V,"Apparently, I must be among the few who actually read the novel. This novel, NOT a collection of loosely joined stories as some might suspect from the overleaf, which must have also been written by someone elso who didn't read the book, is a complete work from one of America's finest writers. The three sections of the book are inextricably connected. To separate one from the other is a sin of the highest order, but in this case, it works perfectly. Hopkins and the entire supporting cast a perfect. Cinematography alone is a reason to see this incredible movie. After repeated viewings, I've changed my mind and forgive the cutting of King's  book.i guess I was expecting the entire novel, which, of course, couldn't be done. But the first part, 1960-1964, makes a perfect  standalone story, with a little editing. They even left in the allusion to King's Dark Tower series, and for that alone, it's worth four stars. So, I take it all back. It is a must-see, even if you've read the book. The period is lovingly and perfectly recreated,, the characters are bigger than life and the story is told with real care and feeling. A rewarding experience. Also, watch it with the director's commentary for reasons why changes were made from the novel.",1352419200,,1248,4.746543778801843
1666932,5,B00005UQ9V,Loved the movie. Haven't seen it since it first came out on video. Enjoyed it more this time. Great for older children. Family movie.,1348358400,,133,4.583333333333333
1666933,1,B00005UQ9V,"The trailer looked great, but of course it would.  That's the way they sucker the novel's fans into renting this turkey.  If you have read the book, you will know that the title is already off and that this is a miscarriage of justice to the section they concentrated on.  The book Hearts in Atlantis is long and has five different stories in it that tie the entire theme together.  If you haven't read the book, you might like this movie as I see a lot of positive reviews for it.  If you have read King's novel and love every page of it, to be impressed with this cinematic blasphemy is not to be a true fan of King's extraordinarily magical and thoughtful work.

Obviously funded by a low budget (most of which probably went to pay Anthony Hopkins), the movie centers on the first and longest section of the novel, Low Men in Yellow Coats.  Well, there are no yellow coats, and the villains aren't the edgy and scary aleins they are supposed to be.  What are they here, gangsters?  Is anyone even sure?  Though there is a very good cast here, the script is horribly adapted from just this one excerpt of the novel, and when it's done with, you feel cheated.  So many things that were wonderful about this story were changed so that there was no magic or point to it.  King writes in a manner--especially in this case--that makes you aware of how all the pieces fit together.  This movie is awful and painfully disjointed in so many places that, were it not for some of the dialog and certain situations adapted from the book, you would never recognize it as the same story.  They should have called it The Low Men.  Hearts in Atlantis belongs to another section of the book in which college students were so addicted to the card game that they ended up flunking out of school and getting drafted in Vietnam, all while listening to artists like Donovan and the Beatles.

There's one saving grace:  the soundtrack.  It is basically consistent with King's story, but not much else is.  They change so many things that the magic of the story is lost, and none of the actors can save it.  I'm surprised that Anthony Hopkins would even associate himself with this project, because it's just that bad.  What happened to any mention of Lord of the Flies, a book that was terribly important to Bobby once Ted introduced it to him, and the parallels the book had in his own life?

I could go on and on about everything that was wrong in contrast to the book, but I won't.  NOW HERE IS A MAJOR SPOILER FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NEITHER SEEN THIS MOVIE OR READ KING'S NOVEL:  I was particularly displeased with the way Sully was barely mentioned, and the fact that they killed off Carol Gerber.  Carol was alive at the end of the book after hiding out for years, having gotten into trouble with a group of extreme radicals in the late 60s, providing for a bittersweet ending.  No, they had to spoil that too.  That's what really upset me the most, let alone how they handled the three bullies in the story.

To wrap things up, all I can tell you is to get King's novel, especially the audio book narrated by William Hurt and King himself.  It is truly excellent and worth the time invested.  There you will find all the magic that's missing from this drivel, and you will appreciate King as more than just a horror writer.  The book is beautiful, poetic, touching, and an honest assessment of the loss of America's innocence.  Don't waste your time with this movie.  I would love to see the entire novel translated to film, but it would take at least 5 or 6 hours to do it.  If it would be done properly, I would sit through the entire thing repeatedly.  For now, this is all there is, and that's not saying much.  Thank God I only rented it for 3 bucks.  Take my advice:  Get your hands on the book.  It's so much more than worth it.  I've listened to the audio version at least ten times myself.",1347840000,4,3888,4.383216783216783
1666934,1,B00005UQ9V,"King, I'm so disappointing with you for allowing them to butcher your story. I wouldn't have minded that they only concentrated on the first short story in the book if they hadn't completely butchered even that. (Even though it's the books second story that I'm passionately in love with.)
 The cheapness of cutting out all the supernatural elements of the first story in the book and changing the whole meaning of the story to save money is pathetic. They just didn't want to spend the money on the special effects needed for the sci fi element.
If you have read the book you will be sorely disappointed with this syrupy ""nostalgic"" nonsense. The film is watchable and has it's good points, but considering the brilliance of it's original source it is still an abomination so I'm gonna stick with one star.",1347408000,,807,4.723404255319149
1666935,5,B00005UQ9V,"This movie is based on a Stephen King story and the movie has a man, Bobby Garfield (David Morse), reminiscing about his youthful days many years before.  He gets a baseball glove in a delivery and notification that his friend John Sullivan has died. He is thinking about his friends and how he met Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) and the strange things that happened that summer long ago.  He thinks of his friendship with John and a young girl named Carol Gerber.

At the funeral he finds out that Carol Gerber is also dead.  He is stunned.  He goes back to his old home where he lived with his mom.  The upstairs part of the house was rented to Ted Brautigan.  Bobby and his mom are not well off as she is divorced and her ex-husband left them in a bad financial situation.

Ted offers Bobby a job to read him the newspaper every day for a dollar a week.  Bobby wants to buy a bicycle that he wanted for his birthday and he knows that the only way he will get it will be to buy it himself.  His mom puts in a lot of late hours at work but it is more to be with her boss who she thinks will help her make more money.  Her boss has more than money on his mind.

Bobby got an adult library card and that was his only present for his birthday.  Ted seems to have a way to look into Bobby's mind.  Ted asks Bobby to keep an eye out for low men and  Bobby is supposed to keep an eye out looking for posters of missing pets.  If he sees them he is to tell Ted right away....

This is a story about growing up and also about an old man who seems to be hiding from a group of mysterious men who are dangerous.  They wear dark clothes; they move in packs and cast long shadows.  The acting is simply superb and Anthony Hopkins plays his role to perfection.  The younger stars in the movie are also excellent.

The script is well written and the movie is directed in a very good manner so that the story just flows.  Ted's psychic powers are the source of his problem and Bobby seems to have the same sort of gift.  This is a fun movie but it is also suspenseful and mysterious.

1666938,4,B00005UQ9V,"Through an interesting and evocative collection of stories (or novellas), Stephen King masterfully captures the loss of childhood innocence, the 60's generation, the role of the Vietnam war on the psyche of that generation and how traumatic events that happen during our childhood spiral out of control and have far reaching, life changing and devastating consequences for those involved and uninvolved.

One character, Blind Willie, has become so devastated by his experience in the Vietnam war and the childhood bullying of Carol Gerber, in his adult life he has gone insane, assuming three identities, paying penance by writing words of apology daily to the victimized character (although the words never get to her), while the same day donning a blind man disguise and begging for spare change on the streets of New York. When he's done, he changes again and assumes the role of happily married working class husband.

King offers up a scathing criticism of the Vietnam war and shows in descriptive detail the huge psychological toll it has taken and continues to take on the veterans of that war and the families and friends associated with them.

One can say that the title, Hearts in Atlantis, refers to the Hearts card game the students play at university during the Vietnam war, but the title operates on different levels. It also references the broken hearts related to Vietnam and the broken hearts of many of the characters as they grow from children to adults.

Stylistically, the work is interesting as King writes in the past, switches to the present tense and also writes with a knowledge of the future that takes on an eerily prophetic tone.

In typical King fashion, his characterizations are rich, the dialogue crisp and believable. He is able to evoke emotion with his prose and sometimes you feel like you are actually there and not reading at all.

My only criticism would be the use of the alien story line in the beginning of the book. It's never really developed fully and does not tie in with the rest of the novel.

But overall, it's a great read that goes a long way to chronicling the psychological and physical casualties of Vietnam. I would highly recommend it.",1338076800,,2192,4.876344086021505

Hopkins is a master,again he has a complex character that is as human as he is real. I have seen this dvd many times and each viewing touches my heart.

1666949,4,B00005UQ9V,"This is a very sweet movie.  Anthony Hopkins is Ted Brautigan, an old man with a psychic gift. If he touches someone, he can read their minds. Sometimes he knows things about people without even touching them. He moves into the upstairs apartment above a widow and her 11-year-old son Bobby. In fact, the story opens on his 11th birthday. (Shades of Harry Potter, eh?)

The boy makes friends with the old man, in spite of his mother's suspicions, and undertakes to do two things for him for a dollar a week (this is 1960). First, he is to read the newspaper to him, as his eyes are ""not what they once were."" The second is to keep an eye open for the ""Low Men,"" who are stalking Ted. They want to use his psychic gift for their own purposes, and he doesn't want to work for them. It's not entirely clear who they are, but they may be FBI.

Anyway, Ted volunteers to look after Bobby for a week-end while his mother goes to a ""convention"" which has something to do with her job. Bobby is fine until his friend Carol is attacked by a bully in the park, and seems to have a broken arm. He carries her home, and Ted discovers that the arm is not broken, but her shoulder is dislocated. He fixes it, and just then Bobby's mother walks in and freaks out because Ted had Carol's blouse open to examine her shoulder. She had an undershirt on, after all, but Mom was hysterical, having just been raped by her boss in the hotel that week-end.

There are ""missing"" posters up all over town now offering a reward for Brautigan, and Bobby's mother finds one and turns him in. Bobby, of course, is furious.

I first saw ""Hearts in Atlantis"" not long after it was released, which also happened to be shortly after I read the book. My only (minuscule) disappointment was that I wanted to see the entire story - which was ridiculous because it would have required a miniseries.

The book was incredible. Each element was intertwined, which is one of the things I love about King. He has the gift of being able to describe a scenario that leaves you wanting more with nearly every chapter of a story. Everything that transpires is related to other events and contributes to who the character is and why - which is basically life in a nutshell in my opinion.

I was blown away the first time I saw this film. I'm glad I took the time to see it again and relive the experience.",1308700800,,1004,4.475409836065574

But for the story, where it would be nice to know about the Breakers and Low Men in Yellow Suits, the movie absolutely fails.

It's such a tremendous depature for a Steven King story. It doesn't contain any horror at all but what he has accomplished with this movie is nothing short of fantastic. I just love this movie!",1279152000,,524,4.645161290322581
1666981,1,B00005UQ9V,"In more ways than one, Hearts in Atlantis is can be compared, and could be considered worse than Twilight: New Moon. I don't know how the book is, but Hearts in Atlantis is one of the most paint-by-numbers Steven King works I've ever watched, and what's worse is that the filmmaking behind it is deplorable, with a basic misunderstanding of how a film works.

The story is that of a coming-of-age tale of three kids in the 1960s. The film will tell you this by showing you pictures of the trio playing set to period music like ""The Twist."" Did I also mention that it barrows HEAVILY from Stand By Me, with none of the interesting plot, conversations or acting that made that movie good. Anton Yelchin is an ok actor, but when this movie asks him to carry it, he simply can't do it. Thus, all the ""acting"" in the movie is centered around Anthony Hopkins. But I even have a problem with him. Granted, I can't tell when the man is mailing in a performance anymore, but if you wanted Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins, then by golly, you get Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins. Defenders may say, 'Oh, it's so well acted!' No, it's just Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins.

Let's get back to the story. Essentially, what make this film interesting is that Anthony Hopkins has some sort of psychic ability which I believe he passes along to the boy. At one point, Anthony Hopkins relocates a girl's shoulder, psychically. This should be one of the more critical emotional points of the film, but instead it's presented in such a lifeless form that it fails on any level of what it was trying to achieve. Maybe this is a side-effect of the pacing. The pacing is such that when something actually happens, you just get angry because you were waiting for something to happen. Guess what folks, NOTHING DOES. The grand finale of the movie is Anthony Hopkins being taken away by the ""low men"" and Anthony Hopkins yelling out to Bobby, ""I wouldn't have missed it for all the world!"" Looking back on it as an adult, Bobby also says this line as if to reinforce the fact that the characters believe this to be true, even though you could really find no evidence of this being true upon looking back on the film. I mean, besides the fact that I've never met a psychic old guy, I've had more interesting coming-of-age stories myself, and I consider myself a fairly ordinary person.

Other Quibbles: Hope Davis plays Bobby's self-centered mom. Granted, I don't think they were going for a likable character here, but it's hard not to be at least the slightest bit happy when she gets raped by her boss whom she's been sleeping with.

Overall, this is movie makes Hearts In Atlantis Steven King's ""Twilight: New Moon."" It's a coming-of-age story where two people form a supposedly interesting relationship where there is no interest to be found with characters, who lack any sense of depth, which is not helped by the fact that the acting is poor. Plus, NOTHING HAPPENS. It may be good for hardcore Steven King fans, or hardcore Anthony Hopkins fans, because God only knows you get a lot of Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins, but otherwise, this is a BAD film in almost every sense of the word. I watched it for free on Netflix Watch Instantly and found my free time with the film wasted. I implore you not to make the same mistake.",1278115200,,3353,4.583333333333333

1667007,4,B00005UQ9V,"Anthony Hopkins stars in this adaptation of Stephen King's short story of the same name. The film begins in 2001 (The year the film was made) we are quickly introduced to a character named Bobby (played as an adult by David Morse) Bobby begins to recollect memories from his past, memories from his eleventh birthday and spending time with his friends in the summer. Including the memory of a mysterious individual named Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins)

Ted Brautigan moves in next door to Bobby's house (played at the age of 11 by, Anthon Yelchin) Bobby lives with his mom only, his father is rarely mentioned. Bobby begins to find a father figure in Ted...but there is a special gift that Ted has inside. I will not give more details as to what happens. The only thing about the film that bothered me a little was the pace; it can be a little slow and sad in some points. Though I also don't understand why this film received a PG-13 rating. It should have been rated G, it's a nice and at times sad story about childhood that is surely to be enjoyed by all ages, can't understand why they made the decision of classifying it as PG-13. Also the movie is done in the tradition of ""Stand by Me"". And it's up there with Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and Stand by Me for well crafted adaptations of Stephen King's Novella's.

1667008,4,B00005UQ9V,"""Hearts in Atlantis"" is based on a short story written by Stephen King. The 2001 film tells the story of how young Bobby Garfield's (Anton Yelchin) life changes when an older man (Hopkins) moves into the same building where he lives in with his selfish single Mom.

Ted (Hopkins) treats Bobby like an adult, exposing him to fine literature and opening his mind to his own potential. In a few short weeks, a young boy becomes a strong young man capable of taking care of himself and others.

Ted's vested Bobby with a job.  For a dollar a week, he reads the newspaper to Ted and watches out for the low men. Ted's afraid that these people will come to take him for his 'gifts'. (He's a psychic)

""Take that, for the Gerber baby!"" is one line that had both my husband and I cheering loud enough to have gotten us thrown out of the theatre. Bobby delivers this coup de grace to a school bully who'd been hurting his girlfriend, Carol Gerber (Mika Borem).

While we rented this film, my husband and I both agreed to purchase ""Hearts"" because we would like to be able to see it again. This is an exceptional film and a very interesting viewing.",1201478400,9,1139,4.404761904761905
1667009,2,B00005UQ9V,"I love Anthony Hopkins as much as the next person, but this movie had several flaws:

(1) nothing much happens;

(2) Anthony Hopkins speaks with a slur that I guess is supposed to imply world weariness, but instead is just annoying;

(3) Anthony Hopkins spouts trite observations (""we're all just passing through, kiddo, just passing through"") that are meant to imply wisdom, but instead are just annoying;

(4) the movie could have ended at any one of its last four scenes, and nothing would have been lost.

However, I don't think the movie's awful.  There are a couple of scenes that are outstanding, the best of which is a conversation that Hopkins has with a local bully.  And the young protagonist's girlfriend was perfectly cast and excellently played.",1197158400,,759,4.8828125
1667010,5,B00005UQ9V,"I don't usually care for ""coming-of-age"" movies but this is a mixture of that along with a suspenseful story of an older man trying to keep his anonymity. Anthony Hopkins plays the latter and is riveting, as always. His character, ""Ted Brautigan"" is not an easy guy to figure out, but he has to be mysterious in order to keep away from the bogey-man bad guys called ""low men."" That sounds goofy but if you watch the film, you know what I mean.

The kids - Anton Yelchin and Mika Bororem - are good, especially Yelchin, who has a far bigger role. It's nice to see a kid (Yelchin's character ""Bobby Garfield"") actually listening to an adult, as he does here. The romance between the two kids is handled well, not sappy.

I very much enjoyed the cinematography. It's a wonderfully rich-colored film with a touch of film noir in spots with the cobbled street shots at night.

Finally, this was a film that moved me with it sadness.",1190246400,3,927,4.4733727810650885
1667011,3,B00005UQ9V,"I only read one persons review about this movie. I wanted to just come here and post this from the Heart; my heart, right to you after watching it. So I apologize to you if many things are said that are redundant.

'Yorgos' I think kind of told the masses here, in essence, how I felt while viewing this absolute delight, this wonderment and uplifting spirit that soared through my tears and my memories, and transgressed to a space that only few films can migrate to. My inner child.

I won't dissect the film and compare it to this or that, like so many ignorant reviewers do all the time referring to its cinematic wonder and transform a simple spirited, heart touching movie into some frog dissecting assignment in 10th grade biology. I think, intrinsically, a film can be so much deeper than it was orginally intended. You can talk about how loosely it was adapted from ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"", and how dismel and paltry audience reaction was to this (didn't it gross only around 20 million or so?), but can you blame the masses? Where the next Fantastic Four or Spiderman await the naivete and senses of broad age specific persons, a film like this naturally, in almost any case, would seep through the cracks. There are only a specific genre of people, and children, who would find this movie uplifting and cherish its message. Not everyone can dance between the raindrops friends.

Like 'Yorgos' review below, I had mixed reviews throughout as well. However the nostalgic warmth I felt as the movie progressed, gave me this euphoric cheek to cheek smile, this wonderful aura created itself upon where I was viewing this, and perhaps the 'Barefoot' Merlot I was drinking, gave my senses and emotions a bigger lift than if I wasn't having a glass, however I felt so good about life, and people, and wonders of the world after viewing this. Is that not what film, friends, what film in all it's purity and saturation to our keen senses is supposed to do for us? Touch something inside, and leave its message their long after viewing is over? Don't we all want one of life's greatest wonders to move in above our parents home?

I think the chemistry and at times sheer brilliant cinematography was incandescent with the times, and 'Anton Yelchin' (who was recoginzed for a Young Arist award evidentally) and 'Mika Boorem' play off each other wonderfully. They absolutely radiated on screen. It must be hard for a director to do very intimate scenes with pre-teens, or cusping teenagers, and the scene on the ferris wheel was no different. Kudos for not making it to sentimental, or too over the top. I wanted to be 14 again, at the state fair, and budding up with my guy friends, waiting to see the beautiful Sally spring forth from somewhere behind the Tilt-O-Whirl. In my minds eye, I caught that grace and splendid camera view as well.

The horrors of ignorance of the jilded over protective ignorant mother, and society as a whole, when coming upon children with men, and realizing that perhaps almost immediately, the thought of something 'not normal' or 'disturbing' enters into the psyche. That is such a shame that we live in a world where an old man cannot befriend a boy, in fear of him being a diddler. Truly sad. How many boys need mentors, how many fatherless boys would have yearned to have a Ted in their lives, even for a small fraction of time. The difference could shape a persons life.

Upon going into a film, save for the latest '300', I rarely if ever read a review about it. I wonder why I would let someone else put emotions or loathing in my head about something that will, in essence, be my eyes watching it. I thought Hearts in Atlantis was about the lost city of Atlantis perhaps, and that maybe Ted was from there. Since it was from King, I ignorantly thought it would be more on the supernatural side. How wrong I was in so many ways, and that is my point. How wonderfully suprised and uplifted I was after this movie. If I read anything about it before seeing it, I might have already formed pre-conceived notions about its subject matter or had a spoiler or two thrown in for good measure. I called several people to tell them about it immediately after viewing.

For this reviewer, 'Hearts in Atlantis' was sappy, it was nostalgic, it was bittersweet, it was full of such amazing songs, it was evoking memories in me that few movies get to do, and it showed me how powerful that a movie from nowhere, can come up and grab us in the behind, and tickle our eyes to water, just for a bit, and then round it out, with an amazing performance by a young gentleman; and Hopkins, in his pure metaphysical craft, can send a kiss in the wind, and lend us a quote for the cosmos: ""Sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been? Then we grow up and our hearts break into two.""

Thank you Scott Hicks.",1184198400,2,4921,4.5588235294117645
1667012,5,B00005UQ9V,"This is a movie I had always wanted to see but never got around to until now.  I wish I hadn't waited so long.

It's a nice simple story of childhood memories and it tells the story of Bobby Garfield who lives with his mom (his father has passed away).  Into their lives as a border, comes the mysterious Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins - who Oprah has even said that he can captivate her by simply reading the Yellow Pages).  He befriends Bobby and while this doesn't please Bobby's mother, it is good for him because he's lost his father.  Bobby comes to see that Ted has special powers.  The story goes on to show the two spending the summer together and with Bobby's friends Carol and Sully.

I don't want to spoil this by sharing too much, but you should know that this is a nice film that is really adult Bobby's reflections of his past after he learns of a friends death.  I found it touching and sweet and very different to how I imagined.  Anthony Hopkins is such a brilliant actor and in fact all of the acting was done well by the entire cast.

If you are looking for an innocent, moving movie, then try this.  It might be based on a Stephen King book, but it's not filled with any horror that some of his books contain.  This is a nice family movie that I'm going out to purchase now that I've seen it and fell in love with it.  I could easily watch it a few times more.",1182988800,3,1381,4.1856060606060606
1667013,4,B00005UQ9V,"Every now and then a story will come along that you place no expectations on but will leave you pleasantly surprised, Hearts In Atlantis was that kind of movie. I'll admit here that I'm not a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins and I still find it hard not to think of him as Hannibal Lecter from Silence Of The Lambs, but Hopkin's role as Ted Braughtigan was truly memorable and a huge testament to his acting ability. The line ""sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been... then we grow up and our hearts break in two"" will stay with me for a long time. No doubt I will end up buying the book by Stephen King on which the movie was based.

1667014,5,B00005UQ9V,"I have read and reviewed the book by Stephen King, and it was excellent. before I watched it, I found out that it mainly adapted the first story in the book. That was alright, for it was the longest and the best of the stories in the book. I watched it last night, and I loved it. It mainly stuck to the story on which it was based (The screenwriter to this film is William Goldman who wrote the great adaptation of Stephen King's Misery). Sure, it got rid of the references to Stephen King's The Dark Tower book series, but that was perfectly fine. My guess for why they got rid of the links from that series is because no one has filmed them. Well anyways, the acting in this film is exceptional (especially by Anthony Hopkins and David Morse). The cinematography and music are well done too. I will recommend this to fans of Stephen King and of this kind of genre. I hope that someday the studios direct a sequel or sequels based on the other story segments in the book. They could film the second story (which is also the title story) and call it Hearts In Atlantis II. Then they can film the last three stories Blind Willie, Why We're In Vietnam, and Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling into one film and call it Hearts in Atlantis III. We could have a Trilogy of movies based on the book. If they do it, I would pay to see it.",1177113600,6,1333,4.231372549019608

1667026,2,B00005UQ9V,"This movie felt really contrived.  While I tend to like just about anything Anthony Hopkins is in, this role wasn't meaty enough for his talents.  The movie reminded me somewhat of Stand by Me, which was much better done and which I felt this one was trying to imitate, albeit with the seams showing.  In Hearts in Atlantis, I couldn't get past how unrealistic the lines of dialog assigned to the children were.  They spoke and acted with a maturity that is way beyond their tender ages of eleven, and it didn't seem natural.  It ruined the movie for me.  I kept thinking ""real people don't speak and act this way.""  The plot just dragged along, and I kept waiting for the movie to ""start.""  And then it was over.  I detected stylistic elements of The Green Mile in it, in terms of mood and format (including even a common actor to both movies, David Morse).  In fact this movie reminded me of numerous others.  Only problem is, they were all better.",1175385600,4,950,4.465116279069767
1667027,4,B00005UQ9V,"Watching ""Hearts in Atlantis"" gave me mixed feelings but at the end I was filled with warmth and a feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia to what I'm not really sure. To the time in which the movie takes place? Not really, the movie took place way before my time and in a country I have been to.

It's probably the nostalgia connected with childhood in general, and the inevitable loss of it, that is so typical in a good Stephen King story.

Like ""Stand by be"", ""Christine"" and ""It"", ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is more about childhood and coming of age than anything else. Instant-likable characters (so characteristic for King), the growing relationships between them and finally the horror from outside that wants to destroy the group so it can get to the individuals.

The threat is all the more omnipresent because King manages to make us part of the relationship, and part of the group.

We walk along with the for kids in ""Stand by me"", sharing their joys and fears and late-night camp fire stories. We share the feeling of being a loner and a looser as the kids are in ""It"", but we also join in and hold hands with them when they find each other. Together they are strong, and as a group, working, feeling and thinking together, they might fight of the evil and defeat the darkness.

The transformation from individual to group is the key element in these stories, without it, the entire story would fail. But Stephen King always finds ways to make characters come close to each others. They share each others fears and secrets, their lonelyness, their seperation from their parents who cannot or will not understand the longings and wanderings of their kids.

In ""Heart in Atlantis"" a boy, Bobby, whose mother is more occupied with her own little worries, befriends an elderly man. Because he lacks parental warmth Bobby feels attracted to the mysterious man as if he was his father (who wouldn't when this man is a mirror image of Anthony Hopkins).

Next to this man is a young girl on whom he has a crush. Of course for a kid this relationship is more healthier than that with the old man and there are signs that the latter is in some sort of trouble. ""Lowmen"" are roaming the countryside in search for him. Not much detail is layed out here; we have to guess, we have to ponder, but who ever they are, and what ever the connection is between them and Bobby's surrogate father, they slowely close in for the kill.

Caught (and lost) in between emotions, Bobby has to learn quickly to understand these new frightning sensations and is more and more forced to think and act like an adult.

When the mother is away on business, the relationship with the strange but very appealing man grows tight, but everytime we see Hopkins' estranged gaze when he sences the ""lower men"" closing in on him, we slowly realize that this will not have a happy end. This is no spoiler however, because this multi-layered story has more endings, and not all of them are sad.

The actual story provided here is rather thin and the movie is deliberatly paced, but it gives the two main characters all the more chance to get to know each other just as the audience has a chance to get to know the charcters. Hopkins hits all the right notes being both fatherly warm and yet, keeping a little distance all the time, like a real father who knows that some day the kid has to ""leave the nest"" and has to fly out into the world all by himself.

That's what parenthood is all about and consequently, this movie too.",1150934400,4,3484,4.523052464228935
1667028,4,B00005UQ9V,"While Hearts In Atlantis is rather unexciting movie, it is interesting to see how events progress throughout the movie. Anthony Hopkins puts on a great performance as a man who becommes a  tennant in a house with a young boy and his selfish mother.

If you're still convinced that King is one-trick pony, you're missing some beautiful literature. King's ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" along with ""Stand By Me,"" ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and ""The Green Mile,"" should stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Kurt Vonnegut, Salman Rushdie, John Irving, Philip Roth, and Tom Robbins.

Although most of the film centers around the mysterious relationship of a pre-pube boy and a 50'ish aged man that has just become a tenant in his mother's house.

The man apparently has some psychic abilities and is able to pass them off to the boy. The film has some good lessons, is touching and is very well made, but it's not for everybody. It's a Stephen King story and has some odd quirkyness to it. But i loved the innocence of the children, and how Anthony Hopkins' character dealt with them.

1667032,4,B00005UQ9V,"I have to concur with many of the other reviewers: this is a good movie as a stand-alone experience, but only if you have not read Stephen King's collection of short novels from which this story is taken.  In fact, the naming of this film is somewhat confusing, because the story told in the film is not ""Hearts In Atlantis.""  It is actually a King novella called ""Low Men In Yellow Coats.""  ""Hearts In Atlantis"" is another novella from the same collection and the compilation took it's name from that story.  I guess the studio thought that ""Hearts In Atlantis"" had a better Hollywood ""ring"" to it than the story's original title; or maybe since they eliminated the ""yellow coats"" of the low men, they realized that the original title would not work.

I'm not sure why Stephen King agreed to this name swap.  The title ""Hearts In Atlantis"" actually makes sense in the context of the original story of that name.  The story features both ""hearts"" (the card game) and ""Atlantis"" (the narrator's metaphor for the forgotten 60's college experience).  But in the context of the ""Low Men"" story about Ted and Bobbie, it has no relevance.  It would be like taking the story of Gone With The Wind and renaming it Citizen Kane -- it makes no sense.

Oh well, it is what it is.  A good film, but a much better collection of short stories.  Read the book.  Each story stands alone, but they also feature common characters, and together all of the stories work together to bring you full circle.  And as another reviewer pointed out, if you read Heart's In Atlantis (or more specifically ""Low Men In Yellow Coats""), you will be tantilized by questions that are answered in King's magnum opus Dark Tower series...it will suck you in and provide a few more months of reading the best work by America's laureate, Stephen King.

I can't stand the fact that it ""rushes' through every important character and leaves you with Anthony Hopkins describing some BS to a kid.  Of course, when AT character says it's the CIA looking for him, the story doesn't break a beat.  However, in the book, this story is a part of a whole series (see other's).

Anthony Hopkins was (as usual) hauntingly distant and the child actors were very good and all...  I just feel like they took the name of a really good book and made a completely different movie under the pretense that it was an adaptation.

  There were three very good, very poignant parts to the book, unfortunately this movie only covers one and a half... I say half because for some very odd reason, they decided to completely change the ending.  If you're looking for an all right movie, then I guess you could always catch it on HBO when they're playing it on a Saturday at 3am... but if you're looking for a movie loosely based on a really great book, this is not it!",1121126400,2,893,4.192982456140351
1667045,4,B00005UQ9V,"Movies based on books don't turn out well very often. Moving a story from one meduim to another often results in a loss of many things that made it attractive in the first place. In this case - the story also contained a lot of Stephen King's ""back story"" from his Gunslinger series, which would've been nearly impossible to translate to a non - King - who'd like to see the film (if at all).

The latter was overcome by exchanging the villains from he yellow coated men to FBI agents without losing anything in the story. And as for the former - while losing some of the book's POV of 11 year old Bobby for an adult POV, it hadn't hurt any of the characters, and even made some better (Bobby's mom semed a much fuller character, for instance).

The only thing lost in the movie was the book's original purpose, since it only brings the first out of five stories. While being the longest one in the book, it is only serves as background to the other 4 short stories in the book which attempt to inspect the Vietnam genertion (something which is totally missing from the movie).",1115856000,5,1077,4.38
1667046,4,B00005UQ9V,"The title of this film refers to the title of a collection of novellas and short stories by Stephen King. This collection contains two novellas and three short stories with recurring characters: Low Men in Yellow Coats, ""Hearts in Atlantis, ""Blind Willie,"" ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling."" The film only concerns the first and the last sections of this book.

Ted Brautigan is an old man on the run who one day arrives in the house where a young boy Bobby Garfield lives with his mother. A relation is constructed between the two and it is this very theme of the friendship between an older man and a young boy whose father is dead that the film studies after Stephen King. It is a very pregnant and important theme in Stephen King. Children are always, in a way or another, the victims of the world, of grown-ups especially.

Bobby is thus confronted to bullies and he learns how to confront them and defeat them. He is confronted with what might have become love with Carol after a first kiss if he had had the opportunity t-o stay around, but his mother moves away after having been molested, at least, by her own boss during a professional seminar away from home. When back she overreacts against Ted Brautigan accusing him of some crime he did not commit.

Yet there is mystery behind Ted Brautigan because he is supposed to be WANTED by some low men in yellow coats and he is finally taken away soon after Bobbys mother return. And the betrayal of Ted by Bobbys mother who calls the low men to tell them about where they can find Ted Brautigan could have brought some complete different future to Bobby, but he does not go with Ted and remains with his mother. The film then is very short since we miss everything after that departure and before his return for the burial of his and Carols friend John Sullivan. The end is even made kind of sentimental with Bobby re-visiting his old home and meeting Carols daughter, Carol being dead, and he presents her with an old picture of Carol as an angel in some school play.

The film misses what some see in the book: the fact that baby-boomers missed their historic challenge to produce a better world that is, instead, drowning under a heavy hurricane of consumers goods. We are far from love and peace = INFORMATION, as Carol used to state. Love has become self-centered satisfaction of hormonal impulses. Peace has become the crisscross pattern of simultaneous limited wars all over the world. And information has become the meaningless soup of being over-bombarded by a constant flow of undecipherable news, fake or not.

Even the central theme of the friendship between an older man and a young boy is rather schematically reduced to something that is always seen as fishy, fuzzy, maybe false, definitely failed when ending with no hope, like in the book, no hope of Ted Brautigan being free again. Thats a shame because such friendships are essential for the simple maturing of boys into responsible and strong adults, and the breaking of it meant for Bobby a ruined youth with two periods in juvenile detention facilities. I regret that mellowing of the book in this film.

The nostalgic narration of the people, places, and times where 3 childhood friends grew up is extremely well done.  It's a good coming-of-age story with a regular series of moments when his selfish mother, played by Hope Davis, infuriates anyone who has ever experienced any kind of competent parenting.

There are lots of good moments in this one.  Lots of reasons to take the time to enjoy it.  And lots of places where you can easily engage in the lives of the characters.",1095897600,,656,4.821428571428571
1667048,3,B00005UQ9V,"Having read the novel on which this film is based, I can congratulate Scott Hicks and screenwriter William Goldman for their faithfulness to the general feel of King's novel.  The movie, however, is only composed of the first story in the novel, so those who haven't read the book don't know what fate awaits Bobby and Carol.
One of the main changes in the film regards the low men.  In the book, they are much more enigmatic and mysterious.  The movie doesn't fully explain who they are, but there are some indications that they are FBI men out to snare Ted Brautigan, whose psychic abilities are ""requested"" by J. Edgar Hoover.  Anthony Hopkins, always the professional, has some very tender moments, but much of the time he appears to be ""acting"" rather than filling the role.  However, again, his character's motivation is veiled and never fully explained, so Hopkins may not have felt he could do any more with it.  Hope Davis as Bobby's mother does a good job, but she is so consistent in her tone that we never fully understand what she goes through and whether she loves Bobby or not.  David Morse, who has worked in King material before (he was excellent in GREEN MILE), plays the adult Bobby, and even though he has few scenes, he is quite good in them.  The true stars of this movie, however, are Anton Yelchin and Mika Boorem as young Bobby and Carol.  Yelchin is so natural it's hard to believe he's acting; he doesn't try and say ""Hey look I'm a kid and I'm a good actor.""  He just seems to inhabit Bobby's shoes, and does a remarkably good job.  Boorem as Carol is likewise down to earth and believable in her role as the young ""girlfriend"" of Bobby.  Their little love scene on the ferris wheel is as tender and realistic as any you'll see by mature adults.  Hicks does well in directing the young actors, and the camera work is evocative and plaintive.  However, at times it's like he's saying ""Remember me..I got nominated for an Oscar for directing ""Shine"", so I have to be as artsy and esoteric as I can.""
Stephen King's track record for good movie adaptations of his novels has been hit and miss.  This one falls somewhere in the middle...the children rescue it and it leaves a somewhat bittersweet mark on your heart.",1089590400,2,2239,4.548628428927681
1667049,2,B00005UQ9V,"Just watched this movie for the second time and remembered why I didn't add it to my list of favorite films.  The movie has the potential to be great but seems to try too hard to be another ""Shawshank Redemption"", losing focus and glossing over parts of the film that might deserve more, while paying too much attention in other areas that don't improve the viewer's experience.
The oldies-filled soundtrack is one of the best things going for the movie, offering familiar and mostly upbeat tunes, even if the placement might feel too obvious.  Others have mentioned what a fantastic job the younger actors do, and Anthony Hopkins is competent here, though it has to be noted that he wasn't working with stellar material to begin with.
Overall, Hearts in Atlantis offers some good scenes and music, but serious Stephen King and Anthony Hopkins fans are likely to be disappointed.",1081900800,4,879,4.8533333333333335

Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job in playing the mysterious character of Ted as well as the rest of the cast who round out this effecting tale of lost innocense and relationships lost.

I found the story to be quite interesting and it kept my attention throughout. I found the relationship between Ted and Bobby very moving and sad all at the same time.

Even if one is not a fan of Stephen King, give this one a shot. It is more along the lines of ""The Green Mile"" rather than an ""It"" or a ""Dreamcatcher.""

Portions of the film are quite faithful to the novel, but much of the nuance of King's excellent novel is lost in the translation to the screen.
Still, when considered on its own merits, the film is really quite good.  The child actors are very believable, and the interplay between Anthony Hopkins' enigmatic telepath and the children is really quite subtle and very touching.  Hope Davis also plays the main character's tortured, conflicted mother tragically and convincingly.
Unlike Green Mile or Shawshank, the film does not end with a ""wow"" moment.  The film is much more intimate and subtle than either of these other King adaptations, and that is the beauty of it.  While the film may not resonate with all viewers, it is actually a very touching story about a boy's loss of innocence, although it lacks the broader vision of King's novel.",1079395200,4,993,4.817647058823529
1667052,4,B00005UQ9V,"Although not a Stephen King fan, the name ""Anthony Hopkins"" on a DVD label always chains my eye.  Hopkins' ability to impart many facets to a character always makes watching him work a keen pleasure.  It's disheartening, however, to watch a superiour talent squandered on a weak plot.  Hopkins strains to cast off King's sparse characterisations, very  nearly succeeding.  Hicks and his cinemetographer also struggle to impart life into the otherwise narrow roles.  King's insistence on portraying life as if we all lived in a dark Bedlam limits their options.  The result is a sequence of tight focus, either through narrow apertures or as mirror reflections, on people and events.  Given the plot restrictions, there's little else they could do.  It makes for grand visual dramatics, but leaves little scope for the cast to maneuvre.  Even a county fair is squeezed into a shill's booth and a Ferris wheel seat.
Hopkins, in a supporting role to young Anton Yelchin, is a fugitive.  The parable of the kindly old surrogate father with special talents is so hoary it bears whiskers.  In this case the ""special talent"" is that of a psychic with wide-ranging capabilities.  Hopkins, as Ted Brautigan, doesn't want to fall again under the clutches of anti-communist J. Edgar Hoover's minions.  They're ""low men"".  He enlists bobby [Yelchin], an 11-year old in a mid-sized Connecticut town, to keep nit.  The ""low men"" will put up posters on telephone poles [in the name of reason, why??], wear dark suits and drive flash cars.  No stereotyping, here, folks!  Yelchin, feeling the first stirrings of testosterone, is caught between lusts - his neighbour Carol and the bicycle in a shop window.  Of course, Bobby and Carol are victimized by the local bullies.  And, of course, Hopkins . . .  whell, you work it out.
Child actors like Anton Yelchin are enigmas.  If you can't get the little buggers to brush their teeth or go to bed on time, how do you get them to take direction in front of a camera? Especially in a film with all those intense close-ups?  In the Special Features with this film, Hopkins and Hicks laud Yelchin for his ""natural talent"".  It's not a contestable point. Whatever Yelchin is to his mum and schoolmates, he's outstanding here.  He exhibits no outsized affectations - he appears fully natural.  His moods reflect his [too rapidly] growing awareness of the adult world's complexities and disillusionments.  As he gropes with these challenges, he matures, but not beyond reasonable bounds.  It will be interesting to see what else he achieves.  Good fortune will keep him away from further Stephen King enterprises.  Perhaps something with Harrison Ford would hone his skills.

1667053,4,B00005UQ9V,"""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" a novella in the collection _Hearts in Atlantis_ is the essential basis for this film.  I am not going to summarize this story--you can find a summary in one of the numerous reviews--but I will explain why reading the book is important to understanding the movie.  Questions left unanswered?  Well, the story is much too big not to.  You see, Ted Brautigan is not just a psychic guy who is running from the FBI because maybe he can know things he shouldn't.  No, that was a story made up for the movie because explaining Brautigan's character accurately would have taken 10 or so hours to do, so the film adaptation altered the story to fit standard movie length, albeit inadequately (hence only 4 stars instead of 5).
In the novella, Brautigan is a ""breaker""--a psychic enslaved by the Crimson King, with the sole purpose of demolishing the Dark Tower.  Brautigan escapes, finds refuge in the apartment where Bobby meets him, and is hunted by ""the low men in yellow coats"" who plan to capture him, returning him to his enslavement.

1667054,2,B00005UQ9V,"I viewed this DVD because I was profoundly curious about the title after having read the book. I found the book to be terrible; I found it to be one of King's worst efforts, and made me think that he should hang up his typewriter.
Certainly, I don't expect a movie to play-out exactly as the book it is based upon. The Hearts in Atlantis movie bears very little resemblence to the book of the same title, and I find that to be a tremendous relief!
The book tried, and failed, to give a story that was too profound, told with too little continuity, and never completely resolved. The movie relaxed its goals, but still ends up telling only a sketch of a story. The viewer is left to induce their own meaning into the few details given to them, and I just don't find that satisfying.
So vague is this movie that I'm surprised an incredible cult hasn't sprung up around it. After all, its ""true meaining"" is subject to wide interpretation, but is certainly ""obvious"" to a few. Those few would be the leaders of the cult, and those who believe their interpretations would help convince and recruit more members, and so on.
Much of the books content is missing from the movie, and that's an improvement as it helps the film focus on one set of characters in one time and place. But it does nothing to make the characters more interesting, the conflict more interesting, or the resolution more satisfying.
Hopkins holds up a gang of B-list and fledgeling actors with a decent performance. But the rickety plot and ill-defined story are this movie's true failing.
I appreciated the camera work in this film, as many of the scenes were carefully lit, beautifully composed, and exceptionally set. Sad that such great art was lost on a bomb of a plot.",1067644800,,1741,4.547770700636943
1667068,4,B00005UQ9V,"""Hearts in Atlantis"" is based on a Stephen King novel, but don't expect ""The Shining"" here.  Despite its supernatural shadows, this film is, at its core, about the friendship between a man and a young boy. A stranger, Ted Brautigan (played by Anthony Hopkins) arrives in a small town and takes a room in a boarding house where an emotionally-broken woman (Hope Davis) and her son Bobby (Anton Yelchin) live.  Bobby, who is hungry for a father figure, finds companionship in Ted's quiet, wise manner as they read, and discuss, the daily newspaper. But Ted is a wanted man.  He is being sought by the ""low men,"" mysterious mind-readers who want Ted for their government project and who thus endanger the blossoming relationship between man and boy.
""Hearts in Atlantis"" is beautifully filmed and edited, with shadows and visual flashes and an eeriness that creates an atmosphere lurking with uncertainty and danger.  The scenes between Hopkins and Yelchin are taut and subtle.  Actress Hope Davis as Bobby's selfish mother is less convincing.  Despite this unevenness, I thoroughly enjoyed this mesmerizing movie.
This is Hopkins's showcase, through and through, and he does not disappoint.  The story is suspenseful, the underlying currents strong, and the acting competent at its worst.  Only near the end does it get sentimental.
Those who have read and loved King's novel might best steer clear, since I've been told by several people that this film disappoints in comparison.  Still, I recommend ""Hearts in Atlantis"" for anyone in the mood for an dark and wise tale about a young boy growing up.",1066867200,10,1598,5.0227272727272725

We never really find out what was going on with Ted Brautigan nor do we find out what happened to him. Bobby didn't keep in touch with Carol and is stunned to find out she has died. Liz Garfield is raped by her boss and nothing is really said of it. I guess this is supposed to represent real life in a sense, but I'm not quite sure it works to tell a coherent story.
Overall, though I was entertained, I was also baffled. When the movie ended I asked my wife, ""What was that?"" We didn't really have much of an answer for it. Though there were some very endearing moments in the movie, it also left you kind of wondering what we were supposed to get from it. For the good acting, especially by the young Bobby and Carol, I'm giving it 3/5, but the story just doesn't make all that much sense.
My Comments: That was the point! We are not supposed to find out what happened. The story is told from the views of a child. We know that Ted was taken away. We know that his mother left and they moved to Boston. It is the story of a boy that holds a special place in his heart for his first love and the people and times that surround those events. I respect your viewpoint, but perhaps you should give the film another try and look to its innocence.

1667070,4,B00005UQ9V,"The movie, an adaptation of a tie-in story to King's 'Dark Tower' series, succeeds beyond the story in several ways, taking full advantage of the medium.
Understatement is the watchword of the director. We see images or silhouettes of characters which will reappear to important roles thirty minutes into the film, underlining their eventual menace and/or poignancy. Bobby's relationship to his mother, one of the best drawn relationships of any of King's stories, is defined by her constant complaining about bills Bobby's father supposedly left unpaid six years ago and yet her ability to buy new dresses for herself, to struggle to find babysitters for an increasingly isolated and neglected Bobby and complain about 'her rotten luck'. Modern psychologists would say something about projection and neurotic narcissism, but she's selfish and almost totally myopic in her views on the world. And the movie even makes you feel for her. It seeks to engage the lonely places between the emotions and mind.
Anthony Hopkins does very well at carrying his sotto voce role, in his clipped British baritone, describing various wistful thoughts of his which turn out to have enormous impact on our characters. He is also frighteningly wise.
I hold no truck with those who complain about book-to-movie adaptations, as expecting a story in one medium to translate to another flawlessly is plain silly.

What a bitter disappointment. In the book, the character of Ted Brautigan is a complex and mysterious figure clearly hiding many skeletons in his closet. His young friend Bobby hangs on Ted's every word, but is also eager to uncover the mystery of Ted. Bobby is a bright 11 year old with a passion for reading and is clearly smarter than his years would have you believe. So why did the movie turn him into a mealy- mouthed half-wit who barely ever advances past disinterested whining? And why did Ted have to be transformed from a potential other-worldly visitor into a government escapee? In the book, he seems to be pursued by shadowy, supernatural thugs who communicate in odd code and have the ability to manipulate thought and reason. In the movie, they're g-men. Boring. Boring!!!!
At the end of the movie, there was a dedication to an individual who had passed away. I remarked to my wife that the producers could have set a pile of dog turds on fire and dedicated them instead - the sentiment would have been the same. I actually felt bad for the person that the movie was dedicated to, he deserved better. This was yet another 90-120 minutes of my life stolen. Trite, unconvincing, poorly acted (except for Hopkins), and yawn inducing, Hearts In Atlantis was one of the worst movies I've ever struggled through.

The boy's mother, played by Hope Davis is dumb and selfish and the boy really needs this father figure.  There's also a pretty little girlfriend of the boy, played by Mika Boorem.  All are well cast and do good jobs.
Problem is that the story just couldn't hold my attention.  It's much too slow and obtuse.  And I felt almost no tension or curiosity as to how it would play out.

1667077,4,B00005UQ9V,"You can always tell the best movies adapted from Stephen King novels because the advertising for such films never trumpets the author's or puts his name over the title (the trailer points out this is from the author of ""The Green Mile,"" whoever he might be).  ""Hearts in Atlantis"" the film is essentially the first novella from ""Hearts in Atlantis"" the novel, and tells the story of the last summer of Bobby Garfield's childhood.  This is one of King's nostalgia stories, set in 1960 when Bobby (Anton Yelchin) has just turned 11 and been given a library card (an adult library card) by his mother (Hope Davis) instead of the new bike he really wants.  His mother launches into what is clearly a standard speech about how the death of his father years earlier left the family destitute, but we cannot help notice that she always has new dresses to wear.  Bobby has his best friend Sully (Will Rothhaar) and gal pal Carol (Mika Boorem) to fill the holes in his life, but then Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) moves into the upstairs apartment.
Bobby and Ted become friends, although his mother is uneasy over their relationship from the start.  Ted hires Bobby to read him the newspaper each week and also asks him to look out for ""low men"" (low in the Dickensian sense).  Bobby dismisses this later task as some sort of private joke until he learns that there are indeed strange people after his friend.  This introduces the element of fear into Bobby's life, not only as he realizes that his friend might have to go away, but as he comes to understand that his selfish mother has no love to share with him.  Consequently the film moves back and forth between the sweetness of nostalgia, which reaches its highest point when Bobby and Carol share ""the kiss by which all others in your life will be judged,"" and the fear that Bobby's precarious world is going to crumble apart.  When this world does fall apart, in several different ways, Bobby does more that survive.  He grows up.
""Hearts in Atlantis"" is a period piece, but the television being black & white and the cars having fins fades into the background as King investigates the eternal world of adolescence.  Ted has a strange gift, the reason why he is being sought out by the shadowy figures that arrive in town, but we keep pushing that out of the way because it only gets in the way of the relationship between Ted and Bobby.  Of course, having such a gift bears a price that becomes unavoidable.  Director Scott Hicks and cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski invest Bobby's neighborhood with a grandeur that we know is nothing more than the product of young mind's, who insist on seeing things better than they are.  The images are reinforced by William Goldman's literate script, which transforms King's story into poetry, and the actors are equal to the words in their performances.  The result is a lovely little intimate film.",1044144000,5,2889,4.693069306930693
1667088,3,B00005UQ9V,"Screenwriter William Goldman had quite a challenge adapting the most unusual of Steven King's books to film.  King's original is a collection of 5 loosely related stories and only the first (and longest) of these is presented in the film.  To make matters more challenging, that particular story is a spin-off from King's Gunslinger series; without knowledge of that series his readers are likely to be scratching their heads in puzzlement.  So how to deal with this dilemma?  Goldman's answer is to ignore it completely.
 Only the skeleton of the story Low Men in Yellow Coats remains in the film.  Anthony Hopkins' character is no longer a Breaker who escaped from the world of the Dark Tower and the thrall of the Crimson King; now he is merely a psychic from our own world.  The Low Men have inexplicably doffed their Yellow Coats in favor of dark suits (did they have their colors done and discover that they aren't Warm Spring?).  More importantly, rather than being hideously evil supernatural demons who only temporarily wear a human disguise, they are hideously evil humans, er, I mean, they are FBI guys, sorta...(Hopkins only says ""something like that"" and we learn nothing more.)  Those elements that made such a strange, bizarre and consequentially intriguing story have been stripped away from the film.  The climactic scene in which the protagonist is captured by the Low Men in Yellow Coats is missing entirely.
Instead, except for a few moments, it is an almost gentle coming-of-age story.  Without considering the original, the movie is an effective piece of work, with excellent performances by the child actors Anton Yelchin and Mika Boorem, and a somewhat disengaged reading by Hopkins.  But given that his character was written (in the script, not the book) as disengaged, it's hard to know what else he could have done--although his mumbling often had me wondering exactly what he'd just said.  Honestly, Goldman was not at the top of his form.  The last lines sound like words of wisdom--""There was an enduring gift Ted gave me.  What he did was open my eyes and let the future in...""  But what do they actually mean?  What child does not, at some point, open his eyes to the future?  Is this such a special gift, the loss of innocence?  I'm baffled, and frankly disappointed.
One final note for you music buffs--composer Mychael Danna makes a clever allusion to the love theme from Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet in the scene on the Ferris Wheel, when the hero's first kiss occurs.",1043539200,2,2511,4.865882352941177
1667089,4,B00005UQ9V,"This film, based on the book by Stephen King, tells the story of the summer in which 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) loses his childhood innocence, gaining introduction to the mystery, melancholy, and disillusionment of adulthood.  The mystery is supplied by Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), the upstairs boarder with a psychic gift and a fear of the 'low men' who are hunting him.  The disillusionment comes from his own mother (Hope Davis), a struggling single woman whose dreams are rather cruelly crushed in the course of the film.

This film revisits territory mapped out in a previous film based on a King story, ""Stand By Me,"" in which the idyllic world of youth, marked by standard childhood preoccupations (friends, a new bike) and terrors (the neighborhood bully) is invaded by the macabre or supernatural, which stands for the unknowns of the wider world.  King has used this device repeatedly and effectively.  Played by a gifted cast, it works again here, although it offers few surprises.  Brautigan's psychic power is handled in a low-key manner, which has frustrated some reviewers.  However, they should remember that this film is really about Bobby, and Ted's ability is a device by which the filmmakers show Bobby's maturation./",1042156800,4,1258,5.167487684729064
1667090,3,B00005UQ9V,"I found that the coming-of-age theme in his movie came across very touchingly in thi movie... I have to admit I cried at the end. The boy who plays the lead role, Bobby, is a great actor, and his relationships with Carol, Ted, and his mother were well developed and interesting. However, there are so many unanswered questions(just like ""Mothman Prophecies"")! At times the movie seemed like a drama and other times like a supernatural thriller. Which is it???",1041465600,2,459,4.822784810126582
1667091,4,B00005UQ9V,"With 'little' not being a derogatory adjective.  This is a 'little' story lifted from a larger Stephen King project, a tale that is altered a 'little' bit by William Goldman and Scott Hicks, and is presented as a 'little' slice of the growing up years of a young boy, Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) in a Connecticut town (though filmed in Virginia).  I call the film 'little' because even though told in flashback from the memories of the now grown-up Bobby (David Morse) it is about just a little bit of the summer of his 11th birthday and we, the viewers, get to sneak a peek at that precious time in Bobby's life.
The acting however, is anything but little.  Anton Yelchin is a seasoned actor, able to bring out the best of his role.  In direct comparison, Anton makes the acting abilities of Haley Joel Osment appear one-dimensional.  However, the role of Carol did not pale in comparison as Mika Booren was more than able to hold her own.  Add the grand acting abilities and screen presence of Anthony Hopkins (Ted Brautigan) and you have a cast of extraordinary artists helping to make this little movie into a very enjoyable film.  David Morse and Hope Davis (Bobby's mother) carry their roles equally well.
If nothing else, one should consider purchasing the DVD for the interview of Anthony Hopkins by Scott Hicks.  Not only do you learn something about the changes made from King's original novel, but more importantly you get to hear Anthony Hopkins discuss his evolution as an actor and treasured little memories from his childhood all wrapped up with admiration for the youngsters starring in the film and presented with a genuine humility you just would not expect from this extraordinarily talented man.  I love him in everything he does, but I believe he brings a special charm and presence to his smaller more personable roles, such as in this film and in 'The Mask of Zorro'.
I listened to the unabridged edition of Stephen King's original novel 'Hearts In Atlantis' narrated by William Hurt.  While certainly not my favorite King novel, it was a very, very good large tale told through five intertwined short stories.  That is really why the movie 'Hearts In Atlantis' seems little to me, because I recognize it as a little cherished piece of a larger, more comprehensive and detailed story, but it is an important and sweet little piece.
Not about the war, not about college, not about the big world, just about Bobby-O's little world the last summer of his childhood.  About his loneliness, his self-absorbed mother, his dear childhood sweetheart Carol, and the wonderful bond he builds with Ted Brautigan, a father-figure sorely needed in Bobby's small bittersweet world, as well as a window through which Bobby catches a glimpse of a few harsher truths outside his 11-year-old world.
Having read many of these reviews, I believe I have what appears to be quite a novel idea; why not treat yourself, don't be stingy with yourself, this situation doesn't call for an 'instead of' decision.  Read/listen to King's five stories, for you will enjoy them,......AND watch the film.  Think of them as two individual and separate works of entertainment able to provide pleasure rather than two works that MUST be compared with one found wanting or 'less than'.....the book has all the details, but it certainly doesn't have the presence of the cast....the movie may be missing a few details and have a few changes, but it exudes the small-town atmosphere and it has Anthony Hopkins.

I read two points in another review that I feel are incorrect.  First of all, the novel is about 520 pages (not 800), and secondly, while some may choose to see the stories in the novel as separate, I couldn't disagree more.
Watching these character's lives unfold thru the years was incredible.  In the novel there was suspense until the end about bobby's fate.  In the movie, it was gone - you know from the first minutes how his life turned out.

1667121,4,B00005UQ9V,"To begin with, I haven't read the book so I had no preconceived ideas about the film.  I noticed though that the style was very similar to how Green Mile was written & made for film.  It's a flashback story, telling how the lead character (in this case, Bobby-o) met & got involved with the 'supernatural' character (Ted Brautigan).  A drama with a touch of the 'supernaturals' to add some mystery.  However, the reference to the ""low men"" was so superficial that it did not leave any mark at all.  Maybe, that idea was more explained in the book.
Whatever shortcomings the film had were tremendously offset by the acting of our lead characters.  As usual, Anthony Hopkins was great.  His subtle performance as an aging psychic leaves a lasting & distinct mark.  Not to be outperformed were the child artists Anton Yelchin (Bobby) & Mika Boorem (Carol) who were likewise exceptional.
Overall, I found the movie satisfactory.  Having seen the film first before reading the novel made me appreciate the story more.

1667123,4,B00005UQ9V,"I bought this title because Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors.  No matter how dull the theme may be he is always brilliant and always worth watching.  Always.
The story is one of those nostalgia films, where the hero, Bobby Garfield,  returns as an adult (played by  David Morse) to his old home town, ala The Big Chill, after the death and funeral of a friend where he learns also that the love of his life has died a few years previously.  Visiting their old neighborhood, he learns as we all do the old adage that we can't go home again.  Nothing is ever the same.
Standing in the ruins of the old house in which he had lived with his widowed mother, he recalls his eleventh birthday and the days following during which he meets a mysterious border in the apartment upstairs and develops a growing loyalty to him.
The story has the appeal of a time past, the early 60s when life was supposedly simpler, but probably--almost certainly--wasn't.  The young Bobby is living with his angry, self centered and rather naive mother who has intimated that Bobby's father was an irresponsible gambler whose death left them destitute.  She gives the boy a free library card as his birthday gift, emphasizing that she would love to have given him a new bike as he wishes, but his father has left them with nothing but bills.  When his friend Carol notes that he hasn't gotten his bike, the boy defends his mother by reiterating her own excuse, but Carol notes that Bobby's mother has plenty of money for pretty new dresses.
The tone of the movie is set in these relationships until the arrival of the mysterious Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins ) who has taken the apartment upstairs in the old house.  Here the story truly begins as Bobby learns lessons important to his life.  He learns the truth about his father, confronts the reality of his mother's selfishness and comes to view and forgive her as the human being she is, and most importantly, he comes to realize the power in himself to make decisions and take command of his destiny.
The story is a little far fetched with respect to Hopkin's character, though he's at his best as usual.  It's as though the author (Stephen King) doesn't quite know where to go with the interesting beginning to the story, follows up the paths of the various characters adding mystery as spice, and ends up with two stories: that of a mystic character pursued by villains and that of a boy growing up in difficult circumstances.  The relationship of the stories seem tenuous at best, but it's a charming tale for the most part.  It's not quite what I'd expected from a Stephen King novel--though I've not read one I admit.",1026950400,,2663,4.590717299578059

 This is the time of the cold war, and it seems that Anthony Hopkins is also hiding from government agents who have been forcing him to use his psychic powers to gather intelligence from the Russians (I assume).

There is nothing new in Hearts in Atlantis.  We've all seen the coming of age story done before.  The first kiss on the Ferris wheel, lazy summer afternoons spent with friends in the huge, cool forests that seemed to shrink down to small groves of trees in our adulthood.  They're all there.  The mother who doesn't understand and won't listen? She's there too.  What about the older man that not only remembers what it's like to be a kid, but seems to know the young hero better than he knows himself?  Yep, him too.

It's a twist that could have been added and dominated the film, but doesn't. Ted is what he is and it is a part of the story, but not the biggest part.  The greatest achievement here is the melding of everything we've seen before into a film that is greater than the sum of it's cliches.
Anthony Hopkins wonderfully underplays his role here.  Just the look on his face while he makes the observation- ""Yeah, all kids think farts are funny."" is worth the price of renting this disk.

We're told at the end of the film that Carol is dead. The final reunion, which so beautifully concluded the book, is also missing. Bobby never hears from Brautigan again - no rose petals.

1667150,4,B00005UQ9V,"I rented this movie some months ago, liked it a lot, then decided to
listen to the audio book (on the recommendation of Roger Ebert's review).
I somehow got through 19 hours of listening, but I think reading the book
would have been a much better idea. Last night I watched the movie again to
complete the ""gestalt.""
  It's hard for me to understand quite a few of the comments I've read
about this movie. Some people seem to think that if a movie is based on
a Stephen King novel it must be full of ""terror."" Others claim that the
screenplay does not do justice to the novel. My opinion is a big thumbs up
for ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" a very well done, touching movie, and thank God,
almost no violence!
  One can only assume that when filmmakers decide to do a movie based on
a novel they've got to make choices. Clearly with ""Hearts in Atlantis"" they
choose to focus on the ""coming of age"" of the main character, Bobby Garfield,
who in the book is in the first and final sections. Thus the thrust of the
movie is Bobby's maturation, specifically in his relationships with his Mother
and girlfriend, and the huge transformation he undergoes after he bonds with
the mysterious psychic Ted Brautigan.
  So while it can be claimed that the movie doesn't follow the book
(I think it does), I was very moved by the outstanding performances of
Anthony Hopkins and the 2 child actors, and I feel that the depiction of
their relationships and growth are superb. Even the elderly Brautigan
character is transformed, which he admits when he is being taken away by
the low men in his final moments in the movie - he shouts from the car to Bobby
that he wouldn't have missed a moment of their relationship. To me the success of a
drama is judged precisely in the interactions and transformations of the characters,
and on this criterion ""Hearts in Atlantis"" easily gets an A from me. And I give
the moviemakers a lot of credit, because, as another reviewer noted, many pages
of the book are often portrayed very well in just a few seconds in the movie.
  Indeed the psychic aspect of Brautigan's character, and who he really is,
is not done as well as in the book, but to me this is a relatively minor issue.
I want to ""give away"" that the title of the movie has really nothing to do with
the movie's plot. In the book we learn that ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is about another
character who goes to college, gets addicted to playing Hearts with his dormmates,
who also listen to the ""overly idealistic"" song ""Atlantis"" by Donovan (from the
late '60's). One final comment - if you had any interest in the movie, please get
the book and read the last few pages, for the ending in the book is much better
than the ending in the movie. I do understand why the moviemakers make the choice
they do, but the ""real"" ending is more touching!",1025136000,,2813,4.437984496124031

This movie starts off really great.  It has a great cast of characters, a nice little feel about it, and the story starts off intriguing.  A strange man shows up this family's house, and befriends the kids.  However, there's more to him than meets the eye.  He has some sort of unusual powers, and he has these premonitions that someone's coming after him.  A plot seems to be lain out, and the story gets interesting.  But...
...Just as the movie hooks you, it suddenly ends abruptly.  This movie has NO END whatsoever!  The story does not go anywhere at all, and at the end you're left with more questions than answers.  With an actual end, this could have been a great movie.  The kids are very likable, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, does a great job.  But, does anything else think he still had some residual creepiness left over from ""Hannibal""?  He's supposed to be a friendly, good-natured guy, but in some places he's creepy for no reason.  Like when he faces down the bullies, you half expect him to whip out a knife and start carving.

Additionally, Hearts in Atlantis offers another enjoyable period piece look at 1960 small town U.S., and it gets those details, with the exception of one or two slang phrases that were born years later, mostly right.  Hopkins plays a psychic whose powers pay off big-time in a boxing bet for him and small-time for Bobby and friends when those powers strangely transfer temporarily to Bobby at a carnival huckster game. Beyond those highlights, however, Hearts in Atlantis is relentlessly derivative, most especially of Stand By Me.  Not surprising since both movies are based on Stephen King works.

1667153,3,B00005UQ9V,"How to evaluate this film means, ultimately, how to bring the novels of Stephen King onto a big screen.  In other words, to make the argument short, to ask you what part of King's hugely popular books exactly attract millions of readers.  The answer is simple to me: his incredible gift of storytelling.  Which, sadly, is totally missing here.
The film version of ""Heart in Atlantis"" covers only the first part of the original book, but it still feels to be running pretty long.  This means, we sense a kind of lack of King's knack for grabbing the audience's hearts, and of the heart of the film itself.  The coming-of-age tale about a boy Bobby (Yelchin) living in the year of 1960 goes on in no steady course, getting interesting by fits and starts, first diving into  a flashback scene of a newly moved tenant Ted (always good Hopkins) and Bobby's rather self-centered mother (as well good Hope Davis).  Bobby soon finds a father figure in mysterious but kind Ted, to establish a friendship with him, while Ted is afraid of being spotted by ""THEY"" who want his unusual ability.
Thus we see the Bobby's growing pains, but too many episodes seem to be thrown into the course, in a disjointed and fragmentary way.  One instance would illustrate my point.  Bobby's mother Liz has a date with a guy who she thinks is her future, only to be sexaully abused in a hotel room.  At the same time (and virtually, simultaneously on the screen) Bobby's girlfriend Carol is also abused (sexually perhaps) by one of the local bullies, receiving a shcokingly brutal hitting from his baseball bat.  AND, when dismayed Mother Liz came back home, she finds Ted nursing wounded Carol, and instantly jumps to conclusion that HE is unashamedly molesting the girl (or, including Bobby, the children) under the roof of her own house.  Maybe, King's fluent pen would get away with this incredible coincidence, but not Scott Hicks, whose previous films ""Shine"" and ""Snow Falling on Ciders"" are, though both a good work with  its own merit, not distinguished works of a good storyteller.
In addition, we have anecdotes on supernatural power; we have secret organization; we  have metaphorical story about American football.  To make matters more complicated, the story starts with a flashback, with adult Ted (David Morse), in a ""Stand By Me"" fashion.  Like the town of Castlerock, King's favorite theme would turn up here and there, but without making themselves organized in a coherent way, giving us impressions as if we were watching bits of some other King adaptations such as ""The Green Mile.""  In his stories, it causes no problem, with his speedy development of situations, his books being real page-turner.  But on the screen, everything simply drags.
These complaints aside, the film turns out fairly successeful, largely owing to good acting of the able cast.  No need to mention Anthony Hopkins, I believe, but the real find here is Mika Boorem (""The Patriot"" of Mel Gibson, and ""Along Came a Spider"") who plays the role of young Carol.  She, with her beauty, gives a believable figure of a girl who is apparently strong, but inwardly very sensitive.  Though a mixed bag, ""Hearts in Atlantis"" should be called good all in all, and also note that without the script William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"") gave, the film could have been less effective.",1023148800,,3355,4.840630472854641

1667191,3,B00005UQ9V,"I came into this film expecting something in the vein of The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, and The Green Mile (each of which I think are terrific, with Shawshank being my favorite).  In some respects, I wasn't disappointed.  Hearts In Atlantis has some tonalities in common with these other films (all of which are based upon Stephen King stories).  It comes closest in tone to Stand By Me, which is not surprising given that both films involve the coming of age of almost-teens.  It also has some similarities in tone to This Boy's Life (which, if you hate Leonardo DiCaprio, give him a second chance and watch This Boy's Life.  An awesome performance, I'm afraid.)
And it is worth watching, if for no other reason than sheer sentimentality.  After all, who isn't waiting to be reminded of their first love, the first girl (in my case) who grabbed your heartstrings and brought you your first, deepest emotions (Barbara, if you're out there, I would have spoken to you about that if I had to do it all over again), your first adult mentor, and the hazy moments when you first developed a voice of your own.  Hearts In Atlantis has some success on this level.
But, there are great disappointments.  The you lead actor, Anton Yelchin, just isn't up to the task.  He'd probably be better suited to doing commercials.  I can only imagine what Haley Joel Osment might have done with this role.  And Anthony Hopkins not only mumbles many of his lines, but he starts sounding like Hannibal Lecter--""What do you see, Bobby/Clarice.""  (Although that might be just me.  His performance in Silence of the Lambs kind of typecast him for me.)
This is a sentimental tone poem--and one whose instruments are, admittedly, a little blunt.  But I found it warm and engaging, given my increasing sentimentality.  There are worse things than watching a pleasant little movie.",1018051200,,1861,4.771875

The story line opens in the present day with a man named Bobby Garfield surveying his old childhood home and reflecting back on his 11th birthday.  Upon his reflection, the film backtracks to 1960 and a period of time in little Bobby's life.  Thus enters Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) a very mysterious man gifted with psychic ability.  Ted and Bobby become very close.  Ted warns Bobby to ""beware of The Low Men"" dressed in black, riding in long black cars and traveling in packs.  During Ted's hide out from The Low Men, his psychic abilities brings about a rape acknowledgement, healing, forgiveness and saves a life.

1667193,4,B00005UQ9V,"Not having read the Stephen King book upon which this movie was based, I had no expectations of this film. In fact, after seeing the film, I was surprised that it had been based upon a Stephen King book, as it seemed so far removed from anything to do with horror, the supernatural, or science fiction. It also has nothing to do with the lost continent of Atlantis.
The movie is, essentially, a coming of age film, and a particularly good one, at that. It opens with a middle aged man, Bobby Garfield (David Morse), returning home for the funeral of his childhood best friend. While there, he stops by his old home and begins reminiscing in his mind's eye, remembering growing up with those with whom he had lost touch, his now deceased friend and his first girl friend, Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem).
The viewer then sees eleven year old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) living with his selfish, self absorbed, widowed mother, Liz Garfield (Hope Davis) in that very same house. A mysterious older man, loner Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), takes up residence in an upstairs apartment in that house. He becomes a sort of a grandfather figure to Bobby, and a warm relationship develops between the two. Bobby gets from Ted what he is unable to get from his mother. Ted helps Bobby at a time in his life, when he sorely needed an interested adult, as his mother seems unable or unwilling to step up to home plate.
Ted reveals to Bobby that some mysterious people, referred to only as the ""low men"" are after him. Ted enlists Bobby's aid in looking out for them. It also appears that Ted has some kind of extra sensory perception. It is a gift of which Bobby becomes aware, as Ted and Bobby begin to look out for each other. This apparent psychic ability, however, is not the focus of the movie and is somewhat incidental.
The film  is simply an atmospheric, well rendered coming of age film, marked by nostalgia and the strong performances of its actors. Velvet voiced Anthony Hopkins is superb as the perceptive Ted Brautigan, giving yet another beautifully nuanced performance. Anton Yelchin is wonderfully natural in the role the young Bobby Garfield. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.
The only thing that mars the film is the reference to the ""low men"". At first, I thought it was to ""law men"" that Ted was referring. I found the use of the term ""low men"", without some explanation, distracting. Since William Goldman had apparently made changes to the book when he wrote the screenplay, he should have excised this term, as it serves only to be distracting rather than mysterious, especially as the ""low men"" seemed likely to be simply some sort of secret government agents.
The DVD provides the usual excellent sound and audio a viewer has come to expect from a high quality DVD. It has a feature length audio commentary of the film by its director, Scott Hicks, as well as a fairly lengthy interview with Anthony Hopkins, that makes the price of the DVD well worth it.",1016841600,44,2990,4.6521739130434785

1667229,4,B00005UQ9V,"Hearts in Atlantis is a poignant and rather somber movie based on a book by Stephen King. This is not King, the master of horror, but King, the writer of psychological thrillers with splashes of the supernatural. Readers of the book should be warned that the movie eliminates all references to the main character's being an alien and changes him to a mere Earthling with psychic abilities. I think this was done to make the protagonist more accessible and plausible.
Bobby [David Morse] is a successful photographer in his early fifties. One day he gets a FedEx package containing an old baseball glove. In this way he learns that one of his best childhood friends has died. He goes back to his hometown for the funeral. He visits his old house, now forlorn and abandoned, and begins to remember the summer he turned eleven years old.
Young Bobby [Anton Yelchin] is a bright kid. His Dad died a few years ago. His relationship with his mother [Hope Davis] is tenuous because she isn't very happy. She doesn't make much money and blames the little family's circumstances on her dead husband, whom she claims was an irresponsible gambler. Bobby loves her, but she's hard to live with. The joys of his life are all outside his home and revolve around his best friends, Carol [Mika Boorem] and Sully [Will Rothhaar].
His life begins to change when Ted [Anthony Hopkins] moves into the apartment upstairs. Ted is a warm man by nature, but life has thrown him some curves that make him a reluctant loner. He has an air of mystery around him. He makes most people uncomfortable, but Bobby is too young and open to be anything but fascinated by him. They develop a deep friendship, and Ted becomes a sort of father figure to Bobby. Ted thinks that a group of strange men are looking for him. At first, Bobby accepts this notion as just part of the man's eccentricity. Later, he wonders if Ted is crazy after all.
While there are many good elements in Hearts of Atlantis, it is ultimately a rather slight movie. It doesn't have the depth or the fascination of some other movies based on this type of King book, such as Stand by Me and Delores Claiborne.
I suspect that any weaknesses here come from the source material. Like most extremely prolific writers, King's work is not consistently strong.
Scott Hicks is a gifted, thoughtful director, and I am sure he gave his best efforts to this project. You don't get any better than Anthony Hopkins, who could mesmerize an audience by reading a tax return. Davis, Yelchin, Boorem and Morse are first rate. Along with fine efforts by the technical crew, which provide a movie that's lovely to look at, as well as listen to, they give Hearts in Atlantis a polish and an entertainment value that far exceeds its merits as a story. In doing so, they have made it a decent and enjoyable movie.",1015632000,3,2826,4.620278330019881

I had rather high expectations for this film - as I will for any film made by the director of ""Shine"" and/or starring Anthony Hopkins.  Hopkins did not disappoint at all; his performance is excellent, even if somewhat reminiscent of his other similar roles.  The directorial work of Scott Hicks, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  He is a director capable of work that is nothing short of brilliant; yet in this film he seems to overlook (or is it conscious?) such obvious flaws in the actors' performances that one begins to wonder if hasn't lost the touch.  It is especially noticeable in the performances of Anton Yelchin (Bobby) and Hope Davis (his mother.)  Anton seems to be a gifted young actor, but he constantly switches between playing a sort of 11-year-old adult (most of the scenes involving his mother) and a kindergarten kid (the scene where he crosses his fingers in response to Ted telling him about ""The Kiss"".)  Hope Davis behaves so strangely on screen that I suspect that she never had any children of her own; granted, she is supposed to play a bad mother, but the character she ends up creating onscreen is simply not a believable mother at all, bad or good.  One does not need to be a professional psychologist to notice that.  Both of these performances are deeply flawed, but in both cases it seems to be mostly the director's fault.
Overall, there would be no harm done if the movie was made a little longer, if that allowed the creators to explore the characters' relationships and especially certain obscure parts of the story (of which there are quite a few) a bit further.
Having said all that, I need to say that I enjoyed the movie very much, and it really is ""a breath of fresh air"" (as one reviewer put it) among the great hordes of mindless, pointless and useless flicks that Hollywood insists on producing.  It really is a fascinating story, the cinematography is breathtaking, and all in all the film is truly beautiful, in the fullest sense of the word.

Brautigan has psychic powers that cause him to be on the run from the FBI and also to help Bobby out in certain situations.  The magic of the book lies in Bobby's relationships with his best friends Carol Gerber and John Sullivan.
The movie decides that telling the story of Bobby and Carol is good enough.  The two child actors are sweet together as they discover what it is like to be in love at that young age.  Bullies pick on Carol and Bobby gets revenge.
The movie falls apart because of the framing of the story about Bobby and Carol and Ted.  The movie opens in the present with Bobby preparing to go to the funeral of John Sullivan (who is hardly in the movie at all).  Then Bobby receives a package containing an old baseball glove.  The movie ends with Bobby going back to where he grew up and reminiscing about his childhood.
I don't want to give away anything, but the movie had no magic, no spine-tingling moments, like the book did.  Stephen King wrote a great book and tied it all together with a baseball glove, a note, and Bobby and Carol.  The movie version takes out all of the magic created by Stephen King and instead tells a simple coming of age story.
I know that if I hadn't read the book, I would have still wondered what the point of this movie was.  This movie could have been a lot better if they had added a few minutes and followed the book more closely.
I do not recommend this movie at all.  The acting was brilliant and the scenery was good, but the screenplay and adaptation was terrible.",1014595200,,2010,4.266490765171504
1667243,1,B00005UQ9V,"If you waited for the DVD version of ""HEARTS IN ATLANTIS"" (Warner) thinking this is a scary Stephen King story to rent and enjoy at home, think again. As adapted from only three chapters of King's book of the same name by veteran screenwriter William Goldman, the story evaporates in a series of pretentious and self-conscious set pieces about, well, nothing much. Anthony Hopkins is mysterious, perhaps gifted or crazy, Ted Brautigan, a senior boarder at the home of a self-involved mother (Hope Davis)and her fatherless, sensitive boy (Anton Yelchin) on the brink of adolescence.
The trailers, ads and box art do nothing to dispel the implication that this is a compelling supernatural tale, perhaps something as dramatically griping as ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Green Mile."" It is not. Hopkins does his best with what he is given and kid actor Anton Yelchin holds his own in scenes they have together.

TH whole FBI thing was way out of line, the homosexual bully wasn't needed , and it followed the book on a mere couple seconds. I defintitly will think twice on renting a movie before i check out the reviews.",1013990400,2,873,4.196428571428571
1667248,4,B00005UQ9V,"After Rob Reiner pulled Stephen King movies out of the B-movie cellar with Stand By Me (and later Misery), it is hard to remember the late seventies and early eighties era when a Stephen King movie meant cheesy production and bad acting. I think the resulting improvement in quality actually inspired better writing from Mr. King, though I have nothing to support my opinion. Perhaps King was simply improving with age and experience.
What I find most amusing is that the theatrical films based on King novels have become the most literary and introspective works, while the chills n' thrills are relegated to TV miniseries, i.e. Rose Red.
Hearts in Atlantis continues the string of successful King adaptations such as Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and the underrated Dolores Claiborne. Anyone who has read the book already knows the story of Bobbie Garfield and Ted Brautigan in the fateful summer of 1960. ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" was the most powerful story in the collection that make up Hearts, and the title actually comes from the second novella in the book, which features different characters in another time and place. In the book, the Low Men were tied to Stephen King's Dark Tower mythos, and I was hoping the movie would keep that connection; however, the screenwriters decided to make the movie self-contained and turned the Low Men into shadowy government figures, definitely human and not nearly as scary. But that's a minor thing.
Anthony Hopkins was his usual excellent self, but I was especially impressed by Hope Davis in the thankless role of Bobbie's mother. She managed to convey bitterness, sadness, love and fear in a very understated performance. I totally bought this character and felt that she was far more complex than the character of Brautigan.
The supporting players were not as well fleshed out, and I didn't care for the hackneyed subplot with the bullies. Most of the secondary characters and events from the book were cut severely for the film version in favor of concentrating on the three principal characters, which is kind of disappointing but understandable for reasons of length. However, I still felt at times as though I were watching the Cliff Notes version of the story.
Hearts in Atlantis is a quiet and effective coming-of-age tale that marries the strength of Stephen King's writing with a smart screenplay (courtesy of William Goldman), top-notch acting, and direction (Scott Hicks of Shine fame). I 'heart'-ily recommend it.",1013817600,37,2485,5.033980582524272

That's a mother's power."" and other empathic messages. For those who are seasoned literary artists, this statement, found at the heart of the film, arcs several situations being portrayed, the present one at the table where they're sitting, the certain abilities the ""low men who wear dark hats and coats and cast long shadows"" have in seeking out and finding Ted Brautigan, and again the overshadowed undercurrent an entire country felt during the hush hush of the cold war era about ""mother Russia"" (who at the time was deeply involved in harnessing certain powers).

Would he rather you read his book? Maybe? I think it's a teaser and a great marketing skill at that (James Patterson is guilty of the same with his ""Roses Are Red""). If you saw the movie (without reading the book) you are going be curious enough to read his novel to find out what happens next.

Quite simply, get this movie on DVD, it is incredibly powerful, extremely moving, and altogether a wonderful piece of cinema, and yet another brilliant Stephen King adaptation from the Castle Rock guys.

I like the fact that the film never reveals who the ""low men"" are ... the book's explanation felt more like a comercial for another of King's books (if you've read ""Hearts in Atlantis"", you know what I mean). On a side note ... the reviewer that insists that the low men are FBI agents is completely wrong. Their identity is never revealed in the film. It isn't even hinted that they're FBI.
The film is essencially a cross between the film Stand By Me and an episode of X Files. There's a spookiness to the main story, which focuses around Bratigan's claravoyance. But, the back story is a believable, nostalgic look at growing up. Anyone that has fallen in love with the girl next door, or has been threatened by the neighborhood bully can relate.

or movies where poor children experience the cruelty of growing up,

mentality of TV shows like ""Wonder Years"" or ""Freaks

a child actor that isn't in the least bit annoying or whiny. He
impossibly stole the show from the great Anthony Hopkins (who was also
great, as always).

1667267,1,B00005UQ9V,"If you were looking for some connection to Atlantis, you'll be disappointed; in fact the only way I can think of to get anything intelligible out of the movie title is to take it to mean the movie makers left their hearts far away in some land most alien to the movie's setting. The movie does waste some memorable performances, most notably that of Anthony Hopkins as Ted, and those of two youngsters, Anton Yelchin as Bobby, and Mika Boorem as Carol. Ted is a mysterious stranger just moved to town. He's a hunted man, but for what and by whom remains a mystery. One thing he does have is psychic powers. But as in certain other movies, from Mr. North to Always, the presence of (quasi-?) supernatural elements is mainly a distraction in a movie otherwise soliciting our attention to more down-to-earth matters. Bobby is ayoung boy in town who befriends Ted, and Carol is Bobby's girlfriend. In this movie it's ambiguous as to what's plot and what's subplot. That's no problem in general. But in one particular (sub-?)plot, the movie really takes on its coup de grace. Bobby's mother is invited by her boss on an out of town seminar that she thinks means career advancement. As they're packing to leave, the boss is heard to utter that saying ""Women -- can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em"". Never mind that any contemporary movie would give latitude to others expressing an analogous sentiment. Heterosexual women or gay men could express the same about men and be credited with the fullest wisdom of the thought. And I'm sure lesbians would get the same privilege in talking of their potential patrners. But if a man says that about women, the die is cast. It's contemporary cinematic shorthand for stamping the label ""sexual predator"" squarely on his forehead. In vain we hope for an exception in this movie. Then when Bobby's mother returns home from being predictably victimized, she walks in upon a scene where Ted has just reset Carol's dislocated shoulder. She immediately jumps to conclusions that she's witnessed an egregious assault. What is the move doing at this point? Trying to expose the viciousness of a stereotype about ""sexual"" behavior? Well it certainly does that, whether unwittingly or pretending that one can expose one such stereotype while invoking another in all its viciousness. Either way the movie chokes to death on its own schizophrenia and political correctness.",1009411200,14,2404,4.880195599022005

Sir Anthony Hopkins gave a fairly good performance of Ted Brautigan, but was dragged down by a weak screenplay. The choice of Anton Yelchin as young Bobby Garfield could not have been further off the mark. It was difficult to stand his whining for an hour and a half. Hope Davis as Liz Garfield turned in a fairly good performance, but in the original story line, she was much meaner and a whole lot easier to hate. The only real standout performance came from Mika Boorem as Carol Gerber. If this movie left you feeling like you were hanging out to dry, it's because there was a whole other half to it. Due to time constraints it would have been impossible to put the whole story onto film without making it a two parter. This is the only slack I will cut the director and screenwriter.

1667281,3,B00005UQ9V,"I read this Stephen King novel with a great deal of interest. It's characters and story line so full of depth, I rushed to the movie theatre when this film was released, full of expectations.
The novel, was written in three sections. Three seperate stories that all entwine. My main disappointment with the movie was that only the first section of the book was covered. When the film was over, I was left thirsting for the rest of the story.
From what the film covers, Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), moves to a new town and finds residence in a two suite home. The occupants of the other suite are young Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), and his bitter, domineering mother (Hope Davis). A friendship is formed between Bobby and Ted, when Ted offers to pay Bobby to read the newspaper to him, due to his failing eyesight. The real point of this ""job"" is for Bobby to keep on the lookout for ""the lowmen"" who are after Ted, due to his strange, yet facinating extra sensory powers.
As wonderful an actor as Hopkins is, he failed to portray Ted for what he really is. Ted is extremely intelligent and well read, and Hopkins portrays this side of him beautifully. However, Ted is also what could be described as ""white trash."" I'm sorry, but you can put a cigarette in Hopkins mouth, and have him wear a wife beater undershirt, but he will still come across as far too classy for a character with Ted's background. Ted has brains, and he knows how to use them. He is also capable of exercising tact. However, classy is not a word that would or should be used to describe Ted.
Bobby's mother (Hope Davis) in the book is so cruel and hot tempered, she can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. However, in the movie, although she is somewhat cruel and domineering, she never reaches the state she obtains in the book. While watching the film, I would see her temper flare, and I would patiently wait for her to get that certain flash in her eye and spit out the words that would make me cower in my seat...but it never happened.
Bobby and his friend/love interest Carol (Mika Booren), are the only two characters who were able to achieve everything their characters were meant to be. Their friendship and affection for one another comes across as genuine, and for a moment you can forget that it is only a film.
Overall, Hearts In Atlantis is a good movie, with a decent story and some heart clenching scenes, but it does seem to be desperately reaching for the quality held by the Green Mile. It strives for that quality, but falls a bit short.
To all who are unfamiliar with the book, I would recommend this film. To all who have read the book, you will enjoy some aspects, but your expectations will not be met.",1003881600,24,2719,4.461847389558233

This film is a heartfelt story that teaches some of life's lessons by the story's end. The acting is superb (but surprisingly I found Anthony Hopkins to be the least impressive of the cast), and I definately see this being one of the year's big Oscar contenders.

1667284,5,B00005UQ9V,"""Sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been...""
Anthony Hopkins speaks these words so beautifully, evoking the entire underlying message of the movie ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" in which the vision of one of Hollywood's most acclaimed directors meets the extraordinary storytelling of the world's most renowned author. Scott Hicks directs the Stephen King story with the utmost perception and attention to detail, and the result is absolutely spellbinding, striking such an emotional chord that the film becomes one of the year's finest cinematic achievements.
But Hicks' vision is not the only thing in the film's favor: along with the visual beauty of the movie comes a glorious coming-of-age story in which a small boy's life is forever changed by a mysterious stranger. That boy is Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), who lives with his widowed mother in a small Connecticut town. His mother, who works as a secretary for a realtor, makes excuses for not having enough money to buy Bobby nice things. His life seems glum and uneventful, until the new tenant for the upstairs apartment arrives.
Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) senses right from the start the inner turmoil in young Bobby's life, and offers him his friendship and a chance to earn his keep by reading him the newspaper each day. Bobby jumps at the chance, and soon becomes fascinated by Ted's stories from his life. However, Ted also reveals to Bobby that there are men in search of him, referring to them as the ""low men,"" who drive shiny cars and post signs all over town.
The story progresses quite nicely. Hicks' pacing gives the audience a chance to get into the story, as well as allowing the narrative to develop its characters, something many modern films ignore. In effect, we feel more for these characters, and can share their pain in their struggles. The attention to the friendship between Bobby and Carol (Mika Boorem) is intricate and detailed, and just as their friendship is given a chance to flourish, so is that of Bobby and Ted, whose careful examinations of the world provide some of the most moving dialogue of this or any movie.
Like his previous novel, ""The Green Mile,"" Stephen King dabbles a little in the supernatural with ""Atlantis,"" though the presence of such elements in this film is kept at a minimum. Ted's ability to read people's thoughts is a plot device that will come back to take him away before the movie's finale, and aside from a few singled-out observations by Ted and a sequence involving Bobby playing cards at the fair, there is little supernatural goings-on present. But in the interest of the story's greater good, it matters little. This is not a story about otherworldly ability as much as it is one about coming-of-age, and the people who affect this passage of time.
Anthony Hopkins is in his finest form yet, in perhaps the best performance of his life. He plays Ted with intellect and passion for the simple things in life, embodying in him a soul and spirit that becomes the heartbeat of the film. His child costars, Yelchin and Boorem, are two of the most talented child actors I've seen to date; even Haley Joel Osment pales in comparison to the emotions these two young actors are able to evoke and portray. The interaction among these three stars is compelling and full of heartwarming tenderness, moving me many times to tears of sadness and joy.
It is rare that a movie has such a great emotional effect on me, but ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is one of them. A stellar combination of superb acting, brilliant direction, lucid storytelling and excellent pacing, the film is one of the most visionary and exuberant coming-of-age stories committed to film, a portrait of the time in each of our lives that we are too quick to forget. It bleeds of innocence gone by, of human spirit and emotion, and earns itself a place among the best movies of this or any year.",1003017600,14,3969,4.821114369501466

There have been so many awful films this year that it was nice to see a really good one for a change that I did not walk out of feeling any bit of disappointment for. I think Anthony Hopkins did a great job in this film and should definitely be recognized for it when oscar nominations are decided. Also, the young boy in the film is good too. It was really nice to see good acting by a young actor for a change, most child actors couldn't act to save their lives. I also really liked director Scott Hicks directing style.

1667287,2,B00005UQ9V,"Being an avid Stephen King reader, I was excited to find out about the movie version of Heart in Atlantis. I was even more excited to find Anthony Hopkins as Ted Brautigan. So I took my girlfriend to see it the second day it was out. What a dissapointment. If you have not read the book, then this might interest you. But the book was so much better. I think if Frank Darabont(Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile) would have directed this movie he would have put more super natural elements in it. In the book the story was called ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"". The reason they wore the yellow coats was a mystery(maybe I didn't catch it), but the ""Low Men"" were from another world involving the Gunslinger from the Dark Tower Series. The director totally ignored the yellow coats, turning them into gray suits. He ignored the ""other worldly"" aspect and turned the low men into FBI agents(poor excuse). He turned Ted Brautigan(a ""breaker"" which involves ""The Beam"" from the Dark Tower series) into a psychic(who cares). He TOTALLY ignored the whole baseball glove element from the 5 different books. Yes, the baseball glove was in the movie, but it was Bobby's glove, not Sully's. The director also had ... killed, which in the book ... was still alive. In the book, Bobby is acarpenter, not a photographer.
Enough of my soapbox, I tink I just wanted an element, ANY element, of the Dark Tower series to come to the theater. Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I wouldn't have been as dissapointed. But still I think the movie wasn't that good. Methinks that director's should pick and choose what they want in the movie. Yes, many moviegoers might have been lost with ""yellow coats"", ""The Beam"", ""The gunslinger"", and ""Breaker"", but so what. I was lost in this movie, but such is Hollywood. Always going after the almighty buck. To sum it up, I feel a person would be better served watching Shawshank and The Green Mile and READING earts in Atlantis and The Dark Tower Series.

1667299,3,B00005UQ9V,"If you are expecting the Stephen King novel, you may be disappointed.

King's 1999 book ""Hearts of Atlantis"" features five stories, including the generally praised ""Low Men in Yellow Coats.""  It forms the heart of this movie, which also dips into the fifth story called ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling.""
The film tells a tale of 1960, when a man named Ted Brautigan moves into Bobby Garfield's neighborhood in tiny Harwich, Connecticut. Bobby is impressed with the old man, as are his friends Carol Gerber and Sully-John. Bobby's Mom, Liz, has her own ideas about Ted, all of which become darker as the summer of 1960 wears on.

Starring Anthony Hopkins, Anton Yelchin, Hope Davis and David Morse, the movie never develops any kind of momentum or energy to propel it forward - it often seems to be spinning its wheels. But at least the popcorn was popped fresh!",1002067200,,867,4.766666666666667
1667300,5,B00005UQ9V,"Once more, Anthony Hopkins proves that he is one of the finest actors of our time in this excellent adaptation of the Stephen King novel (when you get William Goldman adapting a King novel, you can't go too far wrong).
Hopkins stars at Ted Brautigan, a mysterious man who comes to live with 11 year old Bobby Garfield (a teriffic performance by Anton Yelchin) and his widowed mother, a bitter woman who hates Bobby's late father, herself and even her son (another wonderful role for the underrated Hope Davis). Ted and Bobby soon develop a bond and Ted becomes a surrogate father to the boy. Ted has these unusual powers - he can read people's thoughts - which Bobby soon acquires. All the while, Ted is on the run from the ""Low Men"", a mysterious group of men who are never clearly explained, but it is obvious that Ted's powers are something they want for themselves.
The scenes between Bobby and Ted are very touching, as are the scenes with Bobby and his girlfriend Carol (yet another 4 star performance from a young actress named Mika Booren). The scene where Bobby carries the injured Carol on his back, inspired by the feats of Chicago Bears great Bronco Nagurski, is very moving.
There appear to be many themes to the story - a person's need for friendship and love, loyalty and trust, and appreciating what you have before it is gone. I did not read the Steven King story so I had no preconceived notions about the movie. Although the story is very complicated and a bit complex, it is thoroughly involving and the 2 hours were up in a flash.
This is a movie that I will buy when it gets to DVD.  (AND DID)",1001980800,5,1615,4.47457627118644
1667301,5,B00005UQ9V,"The film version of HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, based on the book by Stephen King, is essentially the story of a boy's first significant experience with the World of Grown-Ups, and the process of maturation that this new awareness initiates.
It's 1960, the GOP has just nominated Richard Nixon for his first run at President, and Bobby Garfield has just turned 11. His mother, Liz, is so self-absorbed with her own ""career"" that her gift on the occasion is an adult library card rather than the new bike he yearns for. Bobby's father deserted the family 5 years previous, and so the boy exists without much adult interaction, his mother still being bitter over the separation and too selfish to pay her son much attention. His only friends are best pals Sully and Carol, a boy and girl his own age. Into the void steps Ted Brautigan, a lodger for the second floor set of rooms. Ted, in late middle age, hires Bobby to read the paper to him every day in deference to failing eyesight. And, furthermore, to be on the lookout for the ""low men"", mysterious strangers hunting Ted for an unspecified but threatening purpose, who are expected to arrive in town wearing dark suits and driving fancy cars, and who will leave coded messages around town disguised as lost pet notices.
Since I myself turned 11 in 1960, I was particularly delighted by the visual and aural devices the director used to evoke the culture of the period: cars, music, TV shows, radio broadcasts, women's fashions, and such boys' toys as baseball mitts and shiny new bikes. The atmosphere thus created is perhaps the film's best feature. (Good heavens! Did cars really have tail fins that outlandish? Memory fails.)
Young Anton Yelchin as Bobby and the incomparable Anthony Hopkins as Ted are the cast's star performers. Hope Davis is effective in the role of the self-centered Liz, who infuriatingly denies her son any Quality Time or motherly affection. The event that eventually leads to her behavior modification, though undoubtedly harsh, is satisfyingly effective. Mika Boreem is positively charming as Carol, the object of Bobby's budding awareness that a girl may be more than someone to roughhouse with around the neighborhood. As Ted predicts to Bobby's horror at the time, Bobby's first kiss shared with Carol is the standard by which he'll subsequently compare all others.
Stephen King's books generally have an Otherworld element to them, and it's likely to be menacing. Not having yet read the book version of HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, I don't know if that generalization applies. However, for an adult viewer, the film version will not present anything that is spookily ominous about Ted's predicament. Rather, the Grown-Up may say, ""So, what else is new?"" That's why the movie should be viewed through the eyes of a lonely 11 year old, who is at risk for losing a cherished and newly discovered adult friend to unidentified circumstances. From that perspective, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS becomes a truly magical entertainment experience.",1001894400,5,2999,4.9523809523809526

The movie as a whole, was absolutley great. It could have, however, been better.. possibly a little bit more on who these men that are after Anthony Hopkins?? But character development and caring for the character was wisely done with the flashback advantage.

1667303,4,B00005UQ9V,"The movie was very well casted, from Hopkins down to (a Stephen King movie vet himself) David Morse. The child actors were exceptional, though I wish Sully had been developed a little more. I rushed to my car after school the day it came out and saw the second showing, and wasn't really all that disappointed. But, as I have read the book and the Dark Tower series (plus most all of King's other works that tie in to the saga), the fact that they removed the 'Yellow Coats' from 'Low Men In Yellow Coats' annoyed the hell out of me. I can understand that not everyone out there has read the DT series but I was hoping on behalf of all Stephen King fans, that for once the Dark Tower would be brought to the silver screen if only in part. The change from being a Breaker to a psychic, and the 'bad guys' being demoted from evil, grungy, ethereal low men in yellow coats to FBI agents was aggravating to a hardcore fan like myself. Still the movie was exceptional and better than most '01 releases. Go see it.",1001808000,,1008,4.282722513089006
1667304,5,B00005UQ9V,"This film is different from what many people think of as a brand-name Stephen King story. In much of his work, there is a nihilism, almost to the point of total despair, a feeling that good, if not quite nonexistent, is so weak or remote that it is utterly inconsequential. Here, good is a force to be reckoned with. Another difference, something that makes this stand out, is that the supernatural, though present, is only one of the forces that drive the story. The hunting of Ted, a boarder with mysterious powers, by the equally mysterious ""low men"" is less important that the relationship that develops between him and Bobby, a young boy desperately in need of, if not exactly a father figure, then of a wise and kindly grandfather. The self-absorbed mother and the child characters, particularly the girl Carol, are utterly believable and the sweet little romance, utterly innocent, is touching and real. Anthony Hopkins was wonderful as always, playing the role with a kind of wistful and humane sadness. As someone who was a child in the 1950's, let me tell you the makers of this film did a superb job recapturing the feel of that vanished world. The boy's life is changed for the better and although evil does win some battles, it is good which survives and prevails.",1001808000,,1277,4.7309417040358746
1667305,5,B00005UQ9V,"This is not your typical 15-25 year old male moviegoers' fare. But it has a good shot at Oscar nominations.
I liked this movie-- liked it a lot. I almost gave it four stars because it does drag a bit at times. But I figure that a less frenetic pace for a film is fine, can even be a welcome change from the trend to fast, short cuts with lots of shots and scenes. This film takes a slower approach, and it produces a different feel-- one that helps take you back to the late fifties setting.
But you may not like this if you are expecting something like 60 minutes or 15 seconds. Time feels different here, and that's not all that feels different. While there is no big ""magic"" or anything horrific in this story, like you'd find in something like Steven King's Carrie or IT, there is a subtly nuanced psi element that adds an occasional mirage-like shimmer to moments in the story. It is wonderfully acted and filmed. I brought my eleven year old son, who gave it three out of four stars (he's a very tough critic, so three out of four is great,) and my 95 year old Dad, who tends to nod off generally, and he found it a bit slow, but the cinematography great.
Because the story revolves around the development of a kind, healthy relationship between a man and boy. This makes it (it being a PG-13) a good movie for kids, even though it is not an action film.",1001808000,,1360,4.254826254826255
1667306,5,B00005UQ9V,"Anthony Hopkins is just incredible! His character is full of wisdom, and mystery, yet seems so vulnerable.

1667307,1,B00005UQ9V,"The good people at Amazon.com, charitable souls that they are, won't let me give this film a rating of less than one star.  That's the only reason it got one.  Okay, maybe I'm being a bit harsh; the actors, especially the always excellent Sir Anthony Hopkins, deserve some credit for doing good work.  It is the screenwriter that is at fault here, having delivered an unforgivably bad adaptation of Stephen King's wonderful book, which is both as touching as the most poignant moments in this movie and as suspenseful as any of his other noted works, if not more so.
The story, as told in this film adaptation, has some nice, touchy-feely, coming-of-age moments, but beyond that it completely ignores large chunks of the novella ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" which makes up the first part of the book Hearts in Atlantis and upon which this film is primarily based.  The most shameful omission is the true nature of the low men themselves, and what they want from Brautigan, all of which King reveals and this film leaves unexplained.  The remaining four stories in the book explore what became of these characters as they grew older, none of which is revealed in the movie.  While it is too much to expect that every plot line or nuance in the book come out fully developed in a 100-minute film, the sad fact is that King's storytelling is completely butchered here.  The fact that the actors are good doesn't help matters, as one is only left to wonder what they might have made of these characters had they been given a halfway decent script to work with.
If you read the book and loved it as I did, avoid this film at all costs, even when it comes on cable or network television.  if you saw it and liked it, please read the book and find out what you missed out on.",1001721600,6,1766,4.496875
1667308,3,B00005UQ9V,"Do we ever REALLY have doubts about Anthony Hopkins?  No.  He is one of the finest actors to grace this earth, so it is no wonder how the best moments in the film revolve around him interacting with his young co-star, Anton Yelchin.  Sadly, though, when the two of them aren't interacting, the action is painfully slow.  There is some pleasant humor involved in the film, but for a two hour work, the film runs LONG.  I think this is just something indicative of Scott Hicks' work, as I thought much the same thing of his acclaimed Shine with Geoffrey Rush.
The main thing which was off-putting was the story was advertized quite differently in the theatrical trailer.  The trailer leads us to believe Hopkins' character has some sort of mystical, other-worldly powers (almost like Michael Clarke Duncan's Green Mile character), and so you come to expect something along those lines...like perhaps Stephen King was repeating himself.  The trailer also leads you to believe these mystical powers are then passed on to the young boy.  As I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who wasn't as fortunate as I was to catch this in sneak preview, I will just say the trailer doesn't exactly give the viewer the correct impression of the storyline.  Also, the trailer doesn't even make serious mention of Hope Davis as the boy's mother, in a dynamically painful role.  Her character was a dispicable example of a mother, yet the performance was beautifully executed.
There are some powerful moments in this film, to be sure.  Hopkins has a monologue about sports, which is later echoed in a scene where the young boy must carry his hurt girlfriend up a huge hill, and the cinematography is tight, airy, and dark when it needs to be.  The whole concept of ""the lowman"" character seems a little too 1950sish to work on our jaded, 21st century eyes, but the film IS set in the 50s, so go figure.
Hopkins' character is soft and approachable, which is a nice change from seeing him eat ""liver and fava beans"", but there is a moment where he threatens a neighborhood boy bully with information, and you see that magnificently intense power he always possesses in every role he takes.
Bottom line, go see it to appreciate the acting, but don't count on the story to move you as much as you would think.  Some holes and unanswered questions make the story suffer, but Hopkins, Yelchin, and Davis are great.",1001721600,,2393,4.682577565632458
1667319,5,B00005UQ9V,"Words cannot describe how much I love this movie and I think it has all the makings of a classic. The basic premise of the story is this, 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) is growing up in a small town, single-mom family. Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) is a man that moves into their attic. He has special abilities where he can read other people's minds and predict the future. And gradually, a bond grows between Bobby and Ted where Ted teaches Bobby some things about life and protects him from a group of town bullies. Bobby is told to watch out for the low men in dark coats and cars who Ted believes are out to get him.
The story is not simple and this is not an easy movie to watch, in more ways than one. Ted is a man shrouded in mystery. We never learn that much about him or where he came from. But the beautifully crafted story flows smoothly and all the pieces fall together so perfectly that at the end, you are simply left in awe. This is one of the rare movies that tells very little but shows everything. You are so drawn into the story, you can sense what is going on.
The acting is impeccable for every character. Hopkins, as always, is absolutely amazing. Whenever he's in a scene, your eyes can't help but be drawn to him, his subtlety is most powerful. Anton Yelchin is definitely someone to watch as his career progresses along with Haley Joel Osment. Yelchin is a better child actor than many of the adults of today. The scenery is gorgeous. The movie is set in a small town in the north during the end of summer. It's the time where the tree leaves are just beginning to change color...beautiful, just beautiful. The music also fits the mood perfectly, light and airy, yet with a certain mysterious tone to it.
One should know that this is not a film where everything turns out perfectly or fairly at the end. Five minutes from the end, I was so sad that I wanted to beat the director over the head for doing this to me. However, when it was all done, I just felt a sense of wholeness. It's like one of those tragic movies that you hate yet can't help but love. This movie made me want to jump up and down in frustration, cry my eyes out, wallow in despair, but also to cheer, laugh, and shout in utter exhiliration. It made me feel like I was in Atlantis.",1001635200,,2290,4.3032407407407405

As their friendship started to grow, Ted began to open Bobby's eyes to a whole new aspects of life, love and the meaning of family, experiences he will hold dear in the years to come.
Many will agree that the best part of Hearts In Atlantis is the acting, Anthony Hopkins was brilliant and convincing as the eccentric and mysterious Ted Brautigan, a man with an unknown past, he seems to be on the run constantly.  Young Anton Yelchin was equally great as Bobby Garfield, he showed a lot of maturity in the role, and many of his scenes with Hopkins were well acted including some of the best dialogues.  Surrounded by a handful of strong supporting characters, the development of Ted and Bobby is the strongest element of the movie.
Unfortunately, the rest of Hearts In Atlantis wasn't as interesting, leaving a lot of questions unanswered.  Ted's psychic gift was down played, the audiences were shown just enough to jog the curiosity, but not enough to be a significant part of the plot.  Ultimately, me and my cousins left the theater asking ourselves ""so what?""
