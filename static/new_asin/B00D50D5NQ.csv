5774970,3,B00D50D5NQ,"Joe (Sam Witwer) returns to his old Chicago neighborhood after a failed attempt at living in California. He wants to get back with his old girlfriend (Vanessa Vander Pluym) and join his uncle's Dom (Armand Assante) crime organization. The film interjects people talking about the old days.

By the dialouge, the film is supposed to have two themes. One is that in desperate times, desperate men do desperate things. The second is that being in the organization is not glamorous as it is seen on TV. With DNA testing, cell phones, 911 calls etc. things have changed as Uncle Dom claims to be a dinosaur and attempts to talk Joe out of it. Oh yes, there is a third theme of reoccurring themes, from which we get the title.

The film failed to develop the themes to the fullest while concentrating on Joe, a shallow character attempting to be deep. The film leans more toward a drama than a crime thriller. It is also listed as a ""comedy"" which consists of old stale jokes that are meant to be part of the character development and not humorous.

Might be worth a rental to mafia film fans.

5774971,4,B00D50D5NQ,"After playing to critical acclaim at the Chicago Film Festival, writer / director / producer Sam Auster's The Return of Joe Rich makes its long-awaited commercial debut.  Produced on a shoestring budget, the film is an ambitious amalgamation of styles and themes, at turns whimsically comedic and brutally dramatic. Through it all, Auster pays homage to the history of Mafia representations on film and screen in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The result is a surprising and entertaining film that explores deeper themes of identity, family and relationships, and the broader societal contexts that shape them.

At first the fractured time line and scrambled energy of the storytelling and visual style is challenging.  But, give it time - soon, The Return of Joe Rich settles down to tell a satisfying, surprisingly funny, yet darkly twisted story of honor, devotion, regret and meatballs.

Joe Neiderman is an out-of-luck Sicilian/Jew (""I'll kill you...but I'll feel guilty about it"") who returns from Los Angeles to his home in Chicago, looking for opportunity, honesty and honor. He finds them in his Uncle Dom, his mother's brother, who makes his living in Chicago's Mafia (known locally as ""The Outfit"").  Joe wants ""in,"" and takes the pseudonym of his long gone grandfather, Joe Rich. Uncle Dom sees no future in the business for a ""square"" like Joe, but eventually relents and gives Joe a few minor assignments to test the waters. In time, Joe's criminal aspirations surpass his capacity to pull them off, and he banks on one grand move to establish himself. Suffice it to say that things do not go well. Along for the ride are Joe's boyhood friend, Bernard; Joe's girlfriend, Terri; and Uncle Dom's shady colleague, Petey B.

The veteran cast is impressive. Anchoring it is a charismatic performance from Sam Witwer (Syfy's ""Being Human"") in the lead as Joe.  While his female fans will appreciate his matinee-idol good looks, Witwer solidly conveys the conflict Joe experiences between his inner child's perception of the ""mob"" (and life in general) and the adult reality.  Joe Minoso's (""Chicago Fire,"" ""Boss,"" ""Prison Break"") Bernard is solid throughout: relying on a childhood pact that he would ride Joe's coattails to fame and fortune, he is incredulous that those coattails have taken a criminal turn, but what the heck - it beats his current job driving a limo.  Minoso is charming, eager and believable.  Tim Kazurinsky (""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" ""Police Academy 2, 3 & 4,"" Second City), as Petey B. displays his dramatic chops as Dom's ruthless cohort - with a few comedic flourishes that are irresistible fun.  As Joe's mother, Talia Shire (The Godfather,"" ""Rocky,"") takes the ""doting mother"" to stomach-churning levels.  But the star of this film is Armand Assante (""American Gangster,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" ""The Mambo Kings,"" ""Hoffa,"" ""Private Benjamin"") as Uncle Dom. His cool reserve, aging grace and unbridled fury reflect an actor who not only respects his craft, but appears to genuinely enjoy it as well.  He is the emotional centerpiece of the film, and his work in The Return of Joe Rich reminds us what the term Movie Star used to and can still mean.

Two other characters bear mentioning. First, the city of Chicago.  In this film it represents all that's real about America, particularly in contrast with the veneer of Los Angeles and New York.  Joe Rich recognizes it as the only place where honor truly defines the man.  As shot by Auster and Cinematographer Lance Catania, the City of Big Shoulders and surrounding environs never looked better, and its metaphoric value shines.  Most of the cast and crew have strong Chicago connections (Auster himself hails from Oak Park), and the entire production wraps itself in the city like a well-worn Bears jersey.

The other collective character is the ""Greek Chorus"" of real-life aging ""Chicago guys,"" interviewed by Auster and intercut throughout the film with their memories of the ""connected"" life in and around Chicago's Taylor Street and other haunts in the 40s and 50s.  They detail a fascinating counterpoint to the fictional story, and provide some of the films most poignant - and surprisingly humorous - moments.

At times, the film misses opportunities. Joe's relationship with his girlfriend, Terri (Vanessa Vander Pluym), almost seems like an afterthought.  And the motivation for Joe's conversion from relative innocence to ruthlessness seems less resonant than it should be. That said, The Return of Joe Rich is a multidimensional work that gamely sets its sights on pathos, broad humor, cultural criticism and personal introspection. It's a daunting combination; but with a terrific cast, a solid story and creative direction that's willing to take chances, Auster pulls off an entertaining film that delves a bit deeper than one might expect.",1375488000,4,4854,5.133248730964467

5774977,4,B00D50D5NQ,"I really did like this movie and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me was the shift in the attitudes of the story. it began as a man (Sam Witwer)  who was in California and everything went bad, lost job, lost wife, lost house. he goes back to Chicago to be a mob guy for his uncle (Armand Assante). he really doesn't have the killer instinct. Anyway, it begins with some laughs here and there and then gets very serious. I won't tell you any more but I will say that Sam Witwer is astounding and he has a fan for life in me, I hope he does more. Armand Assante is wonderful and we have Talia Shire as Sam's mother once again in the mob, she looks like she is having a blast too. The cousin Bernard, played by Joe Minoso is just right. Throughout there are interviews with guys I assume were ex-mob guys....they are terrific too. It was just the dark humor to very serious that threw me.",1434499200,,895,4.14367816091954
5774978,3,B00D50D5NQ,"Poor Armand. Its another B movie they gave him yet he gives an Oscar winning performance. I think I paid $3.99 to rent this which is very high for a movie that never made it to the movies....lol.....and if I were to say it was worth the money, $3.98 of it was for another incredible Assante performance almost as good as he played in Gotti. This poor guy should have been plut into gangster flicks years ago and he'd have been another Joe Pesci. The plot was a bit silly, you don't know if this ""nepew ""Joe rich is acting this way because of latent homosexual tendencies or what. But every word out of Armand Assante's mouth makes you think you are watching the real John G.  all  over again. I will say the ending was even worse than the movie. The only thing worth a thing here was the ""talks"" Assante has with his nephew. I f you do not love mob movies and you do not love Assante in Gotti, this isn't worth  a quarter. And to be honest, I wouldn't watch it again for $100. Oh yeah...the old guys in the backdrop that are supposed to be the guys that survived this movie 40 yrs later were pretty good, but make one realize the futility of a life ""In the life,""  It actually as a movie....is pretty damn depressing. It made me think, in 50 years when i myself will be gone, is this all that will be left of me...a review of a bad, bad gangster movie? Now what kind of  a  movie would make anyone think of something like that?  There is no story about a guy trying to make it in the real world and getting so desperate for money he goes to his mobbed in uncle. It's just a story about a guy who has severe masculinity issues and  truthfully, if they had him, the main character walking around in drag, it wouldn't be surprising. Yeah....get me some pepto bismol too.  -(  Im surprised Armand even took the part. I bet after he saw the first screening he hid in the Caymman Islands for 6 months, thats what an embarrassment this movie had to be for him. You guys should look up Armand on Wikipedia. This is  a real mans's man.",1397865600,,2026,4.195876288659794

5774980,4,B00D50D5NQ,"I liked a lot about this movie, but there were some things that brought it down a little for me. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be a bit screwball with some drama, or a drama with some screwball moments. I wanted to have a bit more background for the characters, and more explanation for some of Joe's decisions. I did really like the movie, great performances all around, it just had some confusing and/or missing elements to make it feel 'finished' to me.

the scrolling meatball was a little distracting, had they gone stronger with the screwball feel it would have made more sense.",1393200000,,587,4.485981308411215
5774981,1,B00D50D5NQ,"I watched this movie because it was set in chicago, my home town.  By the time the moview was over my head actually ached and I wanted to move somewhere else.  There are so many things wrong with this movie it is hard to know where to begin.  The plot is incomprehensible; the story line, if that is what it is, jumps around in time until you have no idea when an even is taking place;  There is discordant and distracting background music in almost every scene;  and finally, after all,  that the ending makes no sense at all.  Plus there are big meatballs rolling across the screen from time to time - in what, I think is suppose to be a serious film.  Don't waste your money or your time.",1378512000,,691,4.221374045801527
8589670,4,B00D50D5NQ,"I enjoyed this film a good deal. The acting chemistry between Armand Assante and Sam Witwer carried this one for me. The non-linear timeline took a little getting used to, but after a few minutes, I knew when a time-twitch was happening. The scrolling meatball has an actual emotional payoff near the end of the film.

This is a sometimes violent, disturbing film with some quite funny moments. Both Assante and Witwer as well as the rest of the cast, particularly Joe Minoso, who plays Bernard, show some great comic timing. Do not, however, look for a lighthearted crime romp. This is not that film.",1492041600,,601,4.723809523809524

Then I would be guilty of inflicting this movie upon them and pile up the bad karma that goes with that.  It left me feeling angry and bad.  Angry that I watched it and bad that Armand Assante had to to act in it.  I might begin a kickstarter campaign to fund him never having to act in a movie this awful again.
