2620845,5,B000GYI32M,"The O.C. is byfar one of the greatest tv shows I've ever seen! Josh Schwartz created an unbelievably addictive drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The third season is full of twists you wouldn't see coming. The fab four face a series of new pressures. Seth experiments with drugs and is having trouble getting into the college of his dreams. Marissa has trouble coping with the death of one of her good friends and is still haunted with memories of shooting her now ex boyfriend Ryan's brother. She also becomes involved with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, yet again. Summer worries how she'll do in college and wether she and Seth will be able to stick it through. Ryan is confused over his feelings for Marissa; he can't decide if he still loves her or not. But nothing can compare to when The O.C. is faced with the greatest tragedy yet, when Marissa dies in a horrific car crash. This may not be one of the best seasons, but I assure you you will not be disappointed. And be sure to watch season's 1 and 2 as well! And to find out what happens in the aftermath of Marissa's death, check out season 4 of The O.C. staring Thursday November 2 at 9/8 c.",1154563200,4,1178,4.286995515695067
2620846,5,B000GYI32M,"The O.C. Season 3 is just as good as the first two seasons. I like the fact that the show is not just about kids in high school, but also their parents and family and how they all interact. The cast is really good and believable enough to either make you love them or hate them. The show is very emotional at times and it is very addicting. I think what scared me away before I ever saw an episode was that I figured The O.C. was just another show about rich kids in California like Beverly Hills 90210 and/or Melrose place. The show is so much more than those other shows and has just the right amount of drama mixed in with just the right amount of heart. I highly recommend The O.C. for anyone who likes must see TV. This Complete Third season of The O.C. will be released on October 24th, 2006 just in time for the premiere of season 4 in the Fall. This 7-DVD set will contain all 25 episodes (1089 minutes) presented in widescreen and will be in Dolby Surround audio along with French and Spanish subtitles, and english captions.

The Bonus Features are

* Making of The Subways music video

* What's In a Name?

* From Script to Screen - The Party Favor

2620847,2,B000GYI32M,"The first season was great because it didn't take itself too seriously. Two was good but you could see the signs of aging and season three you get plot lines with evil corrupt one demensional Deans at school and Con-Womn trying to get the Cohen's money. Where did they get this stuff? I hated to do it but the writers and Producers gave us no choice. Obviously many felt the same as reatings dipped significantly and the show was almost cancelled.

Ashame that a once great show took such a strong dip in quality.  If you are a fan of the first season, then don't buy this or the second season. Save your money and buy quality TV on DVD like Weeds or Entourage.",1154390400,11,661,4.32258064516129
2620848,4,B000GYI32M,"If you have been following the show since its beginning, you might realize that season 3 is considerably inferior to the first two seasons, or at least to Season One, which I believe will stand as one of the greatest seasons of television I've ever seen.

The main problem of Season Three is the lack of creativity and imagination. A major part of the storylines are kind of predictable and annoying. For example, Seth's addiction to pot is very uninteresting and kind of stupid. That's why I disliked his character this season while I adored him in Season One. The storyline I hated the most was Johnny's. All the time he was on screen I kept wondering when he was going to be killed off. Fortunately that finally happened in mid-season. I have other reasons to criticize the storytelling this year (Boring and tired Kirsten, Marissa's pointless death, long batch of stupid new characters, etc ...)

That was the bad part of Season Three. Even though I think a lot of things went wrong, I still really enjoyed watching the show thanks to Rachel Bilson and her cuteness and Taylor Townsend and her cute desperation (I'm glad that she is a regular next year).

The drop of quality is important but I think you will enjoy the season as much as you did for Season Two. The great music, the fashion and the sun? Still here. At least it's never boring ...

A RECOMMENDATION.

2620849,4,B000GYI32M,"Alright ive been a fan of the oc since the very beginning and i three seasons later...i love the show all the same. Season 3 i felt was better than season 2 and a step down from season 1. The only thing missing in this season was the shows usual comedic tone. I felt they focused too much on the drama and lost track of the characters funnier sides. The wit and charm of characters like Seth Cohen was just not quite where it used to be. This season started out fantastic then hit a lull in episodes 7ish - 13 and then regained track and picked up the intensity and spark it normally had. I do prefer this season over season 2 only because i don't hate its guest characters as much. Season two was filled with soap operaish drama like lindsay being calebs illegitimate love child? That i was not a fan of...it just didn't seem right. In season three they feature some good guest characters...with the exception of johnny of course. I believe Kaitlyn Cooper and Taylor Townshend will bring new life to the series. The death of marissa was, i believe, a good move for the show. Her character had been through too much and it was just time for her to pass on. Marissa became too much of a ""disaster"" character. Every time i tuned in i knew something unfortunate would happen to her...and for the whole Ryan/Marissa love thing. I never really pictured them together in the end. I always saw them as a doomed couple, sort of like star crossed lovers...if you understand what that means. They were meant to live on a disasterous relationship and in the end, have something serious and unfortunate happen to them. I am excited for season 4 because ive read some spoilers and it seems Josh Schwartz is really getting back involved with the show and hes come up with some good ideas. Season 3, while not a complete hit was better than season 2 and it is tv that you won't want to miss. So i highly recommend you pick up Season 3 of The O.C.",1154217600,2,1931,4.366666666666666
2620850,3,B000GYI32M,"December 1, 2006 Addition:  I wanted to add a note responding to my own question in my original headline:  Can it rebound in Season Four?  The great news is:  Yes!  If there were an Emmy given for ""The Comeback Show of the Year,"" THE O.C. after its first five episodes would have to be a leading candidate.  I will be honest:  I initially tuned in just to verify that THE O.C. in its 4th season was as bad as it was in its 3rd.  I was going to watch two or three episodes and then give up on it.  The great news is that it has completely returned to form and is now as good as it has been since it first started.  This was not expected!  The main reason is has been so good has been that it has gotten back to enjoying the characters, instead of introducing a string of unlikable ones that no one can stand.  So far this season, not a single irritating new character!  I was afraid that they would make Caitlin into the new Marissa, but so far she hasn't been too bad.  The biggest surprise has to be Taylor.  I assumed that she would no longer be a part of the show this season, but they not only have brought her back, they've made her vastly more intersting and sympathetic than I would ever have imagined.  She is actually now a character I like.  Who'd a thunk it?  Right now the show is as strong as it was in Season One.  One of the best turnarounds I've ever seen a show make.

The third season of THE OC was an almost unbelievable come down from the first two fun seasons.  The things that made people enjoy the show the first two seasons were largely pushed to the side, while the more irritating features of the first two seasons were brought to the fore and made the center of the show.  On several occasions both I and my good friend who also watches the show debated about whether we were going to stop watching it.  There is a point where the displeasure is watching the show threatened to overwhelm any pleasures it brought.  Then, after a season of one unpleasantness after another, the show ended on a shocker.  Normally one would require a Spoiler warning for this, but unfortunately Mischa Barton herself spoiled the ending by announcing on national TV a few days before the season finale that her character was going to die on the show.  Why she did this has been debated.  Was she trying to hurt the show?  Was she just being stupid?  Whatever the reason, what would have been one of the most shocking endings in recent TV history was common knowledge even before it aired.

What went wrong in Season Three?  Well, the same things that went wrong in Seasons 1 and 2 but that played a smaller role each year:  the introduction of exceedingly unpleasant and irritating characters who dominate the course of the show's narrative.  In Season One this was mainly restricted to Oliver, one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a TV show.  My guess is that the show's creative team misinterpreted what made the show popular in Season One.  Instead of the fun alchemy between the younger members of the cast along with the narratives centering on the adult cast members--which I think was about 99% of the reason people liked the show--they imagined that the chaos injected into the show by Oliver's character was what people loved about it.  My own belief is that people liked the show DESPITE Oliver and the chaos he created, not because of him.  I'm sure the show's producers imagined that Oliver was a character that viewers loved to hate, instead of merely hating him, which was the actual case.  So, in Season Two, the show's producers and writers gave even more characters that we merely hated (instead of loved to hate), the unlikable Alex (who was unlikable not because she became Marissa's lover but because she was merely unlikable) and Trey, Ryan's older brother.

Because the producer's misunderstood what people were liking about the show--people liked the main characters, not the situations generated by the minor, intensely unlikable characters who upset the show's chemistry--they flooded the third season with terrible characters.  It started early on in the rehab facility, where we were introduced to the duplicitous Charlotte, a role on which they wasted the wonderful Jeri Ryan.  Luckily, Charlotte didn't stay on the show very long, though she was extremely unpleasant while she did.  Also early in the season was the terrible Dean Jack Hess, another thoroughly unlikable and wildly implausible character who seemed to have a personal vendetta against Ryan and Marissa.  He too disappeared fairly early on.  But by then we had been introduced to Johnny, a semi-professional surfer at the public school Marissa was forced to attend after she was kicked out of her private school (her dismissal being merely one more of a host of unbelievable developments).  Now, in Johnny's defense, he was not for the most part a terrible character.  But his crush on Marissa and Marissa's ongoing inability to do the commonsense things to protect her relationship with Ryan was part and parcel of the stupidity on the part of all the major characters that almost caused the show to unravel.  But even with all these irritating characters, the show's producers weren't done.  Taylor Townshend was not really a character but a cartoon of a character, someone determined to take over as the school's social leader with the departure of Marissa and as Seth's girlfriend.  Now, I will concede that she did become less unlikable as the season went on, and I liked that the show tried to turn her from a bad to a good character.  But throughout she remained intensely annoying.  There were numerous other unpleasant characters, but the crown for the title of King of the annoying characters of the third season clearly belongs to Vollchek, Johnny's surfing competitor, petty thug, briefly Marissa's lover, and all around annoying guy.  He is also the guy who causes Marissa's death.  While he doesn't come up to the annoying level of Oliver, he is close.

As a result of this endless parade of unlikable characters and stupid behavior on the part of the main characters (except Summer, who seems to be the only character immune to occasional idiocy--her aside, there were numerous occasions when you wanted to smack all of the major characters aside the head and yell, ""Will you get a grip!""), fan discontent grew and grew and ratings of the show fell precipitously.  After the end of the season there were rumors that FOX was so displeased with the show that they considered canceling it.  In the end, they agreed to bring it back for 16 episodes, starting it much later in the season's schedule and running it without repeats, with the possibility of adding additional episodes if the ratings recover and if it turns out that people watch the show with Marissa off the show.  It may well turn out, however, that the terrible Season Three was the beginning of the end for THE OC.

My central complaint with the show--even more than the parade of awful guest characters--is that the show more and more abandoned what made the show fun in the first two seasons:  the interplay between the central characters.  I hated Oliver and Trey and Alex and Vollchek and Johnny et al. but loved Sandy standing up for his principles, the wonderful interplay between Summer and Seth, Ryan and Marissa's mutual attraction despite their backgrounds.  Everything else I put up with so I could enjoy that part of the show.  But more and more this all retreated to the background.  To be honest, pretty much the only reason I continued watching the show throughout Season Three was to enjoy the improbable relationship between Summer and Seth.  As unhappy as I was with Season 3, I will probably at least start off watching the show in Season 4 just to see how they are doing.  But my interest in the show is at this point on life support.

No question that the single biggest development in the entire run of the show was the death of Marissa.  As much as some fans want her to come back, she is definitely dead and definitely won't be back.  Mischa Barton's departure from the show seems to be a mutual decision.  As the show's highest profile character (she has appeared on numerous magazine covers the past three years), she has undoubtedly been contemplating leaving TV for the movies for some time, a move accelerated by her well-publicized financial obligations owing to a break up.  Even if she and the producers wanted her back, she is already tied to several movies projects and unable to do so.  There are many fans who watched the show just to see if Ryan and Marissa would get back together.  For them her departure could be fatal to their interest in the show.  But the fact is that almost all of the horrible characters I noted earlier were connected to the show via Marissa.  Almost all of the worst things in the show were narratively tied to Marissa.  So, there is a real chance that the show could develop in different and better directions.  But I am fearful that the writers and producers will continue in the direction the show has gone, bringing in one awful character after another, having the main characters engage in self-defeating or self-destructive behavior.  When I first started watching the show, it was largely because of elements it shared with a show like THE GILMORE GIRL (on which Adam Brody was a character).  I was hoping for a comedy with dramatic subplots, but instead the show has descended more and more into melodrama with less and less comedy.  But I'm hoping that in Season 4 they can shift the focus more onto Summer and Seth and thereby emphasize the comedic elements that made the show so much fun in the first two seasons.  But, I'm prepared to be disappointed.",1154131200,125,9714,4.664315108759554
2620851,3,B000GYI32M,"There are four people to thank for saving The OC from cancellation and those four are Peter Gallagher, Adam Brody, Rachel Bilson and Kelly Rowan. These four tremendous actors make a lifeless season of an entertaining, sometimes brilliant show seem great.

Some people not to thank: the writers, Mischa Barton for her terrible acting, Ben McKenzie for brooding and making awkward smiles and Tate Donavan for making his character more of a looser than he's written.

Why is this season so lifeless? Well, for one thing, a plethora of new characters that pale in comparsion to Anna and even Oliver are added. Characters like Johnny, Chillie and the non-charcter Volcheck, who really is just a mime that punches and broods.

The dialogue also looses its wit. Yes, Brody, Gallagher and the rest of the Cohen clan are still very funny, but their dialogue has none of the snap, crackle and pop of Season 1 and even Season 2.

The new music also is rather annoying. It sounds like one note is being played throughout an entire scene.

And finally, the stories. The show starts off with some interesting plot lines for the adults and even gives Kirsten Cohen a touching moment at AA (later in the season). But the kids are constantly have new idiots being thrown at them. The only character who is the saving grace of the show is the kinda new character of Marissa's sister, Katlin. The character, a teenage sexpot, seems like an interesting addtion. The stories, which are just rehashes of previous ones (without decent dialouge) are boring. The only saving grace of a story lines were the ones that involved Sandy's hospital dream and Brody's drug use.

And I'm forgetting one more thing, the character of Taylor who really bugs me. I don't know why. She just seems wrong for th show. The actress who plays her does fine with the part, I just don't like the character.

With the death of the awful character of Marissa played by the bland Mischa Barton (whom must take acting lessons), hopefully the fourth season will bring new beginnings to the show. I'm curious and excited to see what Marrissa's sister will bring to the show and what antics Brody will pull. I'm also interested in seeing how Sandy and Kirsten develop. Mr. Gallagher and Ms. Rowan have been overlooked for three years at the Emmys for these strong performances.

I'm also curious if Ryan will kill himself after the death of his love Marissa. That might help the show too.",1153958400,3,2436,4.72877358490566
2620852,4,B000GYI32M,"The OC season 3 is senior year for our favourite teens as they enter the end of an era. This season is probably the worst of all three seasons so far, but it does show that senior year isn't perfect.

In this season, Ryan and Marissa's relationship takes a turn after Marissa shot Ryan's brother Trey to protect Ryan from being killed. While Trey turns out fine, Ryan and Marissa must deal with the consequences of this towards their relationship. Marissa is soon expelled from school, leaving her to meet some new friends at her new school. Marissa isn't able to talk to Ryan about the Trey issue, but she is with a new friend Johnny. Soon, Marissa gets closer with Johnny and further away from Ryan. Things heaten up when Marissa's little sister Kaitlyn returns from boarding school all grown up and makes a play for Johnny. Marissa realizes that she does have feelings for Johnny, but she loves Ryan. This soon leads Johnny to die. His cousin Sadie returns for the funeral, but gets closer with Ryan. Ryan and Marissa break up now. Marissa then goes for support with a bad-boy Volchuk. THese relationships stay put for a while as Ryan and Marissa become friends again. But after Sadie leaves and Volchuk breaks Marissa's heart, they are single. But, as they seem to almost be getting together, tragedy occurs when Volchuk does the unthinkable to Marissa (see the DVD for this one). Seth and Summer remain happy and try to keep Ryan and Marissa happy too. But a perky teen named Taylor tries to take Marissa's place in school when she leaves, making Summer fight for Marissa. Taylor tries to steal everything from Summer including Seth, but they win as Taylor loses everything. They gradually become friends and deal with Summer's father's affair with Marissa's mom. But, things get worse when Seth gets nervous for college so smokes pot and lies to Summer about certain things. Their relationship gets more strained when Seth is not accepted to the same college as Summer so he lies to her and breaks up with her so she'll stay at the college (Brown). But, Seth realizes he has to stop his lying and the truth is all revealed. Their relationship then seems great, but most likely doomed after Marissa's tragedy. Kirsten returns home and works to get better, but Sandy gets worse as he becomes a 'workaholic'. This leads Kirsten eventually to relapse, but they finally make up after Sandy returns to his old job and now Sandy or Kirsten aren't making mistakes. Julie tries to get back with Jimmy, but he soon leaves as she learns she is broke. She then is sent to live in a trailer for a while until she is enchanted by Summer's father. She is soon engaged and they move into Summer's house. Their relationship seems great, but it most likely will be strained due to Marissa's tragedy.

Other stories take place too, but nothing is as big as the most devastating and shocking finale yet to lead the show in a new direction next season. But, I would recommend buying this DVD just to fill the collection and some episodes are spectacular.",1153872000,,3039,4.657355679702048

2620895,3,B000GYI32M,"Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 2, but no major season 3 giveaways.  Chances are after all this time anyone reading will know how season 2 ends, but just in case skip the first couple paragraphs.

Season 3 is much darker than the others.  The season continues the fallout over Caleb's death and Kirsten going off to rehab for alcoholism, and Marissa's shooting of Trey.  The cast shuffle continues this season with the departure of Tate Donovan (the show uses Jimmy's continued money woes to write the character off, and introducing a bunch of ancillary characters to stir up relationship issues (mainly the Ryan/Marissa relationship).  Personally I think the best addition to the cast is Autumn Reeser, who plays Taylor Townsend.  At first she is kind of a villain for the younger characters and ends up being (almost) one of the group.  She has great comedic chops and brings what little comedy there is during the season.

The rest of the season really is about the characters spiraling off the rails. Sandy takes over the Newport Group and becomes more and more like Caleb than he or anyone else wants.  Seth goes through a ""troubled"" phase which is fairly tame considering, but threatens his relationship with Summer. Marissa continues the tailspin she never really got out of, which leads Ryan to have to choose whether to try and protect her or let her go.

Like in the other seasons they jam pack a lot of storylines into the season.  Some play themselves out within a few weeks and others linger.  I don't necessarily think trying to take the characters in a different direction (which they were clearly trying to do, at least to some extent) always worked very well this season.  I think the show would have been better off putting heavier focus on a few of the storylines and not try to jam as much in.

The acting in the show was still very good despite some lack luster material to work with.  Autumn Reeser pretty much stole every scene she was in, especially toward the end of the season.  The recasting of Kaitlin Cooper with Willa Holland was okay, but they never really gave the character much to do besides be a trouble making brat.  There was not as much of the main cast interaction that made the first couple seasons of the show really good, and the show did fall off some as a result.  I am not in the camp of people who totally despise this season, but I did think it was more lackluster.

As far as extras go, there are some behind the scenes material, a gag reel and a few other things.  Nothing all that great, but okay for what is there.",1411689600,,2586,4.568329718004338

Characters are very likeable. Kid from the bad part of town adopted by rich Jewish family, neighbors are constantly in and out of wed and cheating, teens are constantly fretting over being...well...teens, grumpy rich old neighbor/relative that is always fun to hate, everyone is constantly in/out of trouble with the law, lawyers, or each other.

2620966,4,B000GYI32M,"The third season of The O.C. was a huge disappointment after the wildly successful first season and the pretty good second season.  This year, the kids are seniors and college is on the horizon.  Ryan romances a dull newcomer, acts like he's 40 years old, and has way too little screen time.  Marissa, once the queen of Harbor School, goes to  public school with some unsavory new friends.  Summer and Seth spend most of their time bickering, as do Sandy and Kirsten.  Only spunky Julie Cooper stays true to her character as she merrily copes with new-found poverty and an unexpected new love.

What made the show great in the beginning was seeing Ryan adjust to the Newpsies and the on-again, off-again romances of the ""Core Four"" and their parents.  Sadly, this season that all took a back seat to tedious guest-star story arcs featuring unlikable and off-putting characters.

Even with all its shortcomings, though, this season is a must for OC fans and it does end in a surprisingly exciting finale.  3.5 stars.",1257897600,,1015,4.781609195402299
2620982,5,B000GYI32M,"Arguably the most controversial season of the four to date. I bought this Season a few years ago from Amazon because I didn't want to wait any longer here in Australia! And I'm glad I did because the casing is much fancier than our local editions, here.

I was a late bloomer with the OC, only watching it when a friend let me borrow his pirate copies once season 4 had already began on TV. That wasn't enough for me, I HAD to have my own legitimate copies and have not regretted my decision.

The OC is dramatic, interesting and yet fun and humourous. The characters all compliment eachother and none leave the viewer rolling their eyes and fast-forwarding to the next episode in boredom. I've watched the series twice now and will watch it again down the track. There's something magical about this show, something that 'just works'. Check it out, suitable for a wide audience. 10/10.",1251504000,,886,4.60126582278481

2620984,3,B000GYI32M,"I found the third season to be a tale of two halves. The first half was very disappointing. It was hurt by new irratating and implausable characters. (Johnny, I thought, was boring. Jim Cooper, an old character, was pathetic. I would have preferred to see that he grew and learned from his mistakes.)

Some of the story lines were also implausable and weak. I suspect this was partly because there was no great conflict in the series. Ryan had become assimilated into Newport and was no longer at odds with it. (I think a nice twist would have been to deepen the conflict between Marissa and her new public-school world.)

In short, I no longer knew what the series was about, or what important goals its characters had.

I found the the second half of the season much better, especially because the series seemed to take a deeper, more dramatic turn. (It was certainly an adult drama as much as a teen one.) Yes, there were some problems - I felt Seth's pot smoking happened too fast and wasn't developed - but I like the way Julie's character seemed to grow and the way Kristen battled her alcoholism.

It seemed the good, likeable characters - to me the most endearing part of the series - had a more central role.

Finally, though I know some will disagree, I think Vollcheck, a perfect, believable rival to Ryan, brought a much needed sense of good vs. evil. I now had someone to root against.

And so I again became addicted to The O.C.",1243123200,,1442,4.505747126436781

Although a lot of this show does not deal in what I would call reality, it does deal well with some real-life situations realistically.  Kirsten's alcoholism, Marissa's experimentation in a same-sex realationship and the fall out from Marissa shooting Ryan's brother Trey.  Spoiler alert!  Obviously it sucks that Marissa was killed off, but think about it, what more could she do.  She is one of the most tragic characters ever on prime time TV.

2620991,2,B000GYI32M,"Well, this is by far the worst season of the series and possibly the reason why the show lost so much of its fans. They try to reuse ideas that worked for season 1 and the second time around it seems old and boring. Personally, the character of marissa becomes extremely annoying and the series arc is dissapointing. But if you're an OC fan like me you'll probably still end up buying this season",1190160000,,396,4.364864864864865
2621002,2,B000GYI32M,"I have a theory about the OC - or at least the first 3 seasons.  The more grim and depressing it is, the darker the box gets.  The first season was packaged in sunny orange to reflect the humour and fun of the show, while season 2 was slightly more melancholy in blue...well Season 3 comes in a grey box.  What do you make of that?

I was hesitant to even buy S3 of The OC on DVD because in my memory it wasn't as good as the first two seasons, and I was proven right upon rewatching it.  My friends & I have discussed what goes wrong in this season (and the following, let's not even go there) and it's many-fold.  For one, the fact that everything eventually turns out okay is quite predictable.  Sure characters die, but they're brushed under the rug.  A second problem is the focus on secondary or minor characters as the original family focus is diminished.  All of a sudden you have episodes devoted to Marissa's little sister or Summer's dad or the school villain Taylor or Sandy's co-worker, and it becomes a lot less about the family unit created in Season 1 and torn apart in Season 2 with Sandy & Kirsten's problems.

Which leads to a third major problem, all of a sudden, Kirsten is a non-entity on the show.  She does nothing but give disapproving glares and momly advice, there are no fiery outbursts or comical musings as we saw in earlier seasons.  Did I mention the show also becomes a lot less funny?  Everything is all gloom and doom and misunderstandings abound.  But really the number one thing that I think kills this season is the fact everyone is so seperate and dealing with so many seperate (but predictable these days) storylines and small characters that you stop caring.

To recap the season briefly - if the above paragraphs haven't convinced you of its downfall - it picks up several months after the shooting incident with Marissa.  Of course, things turn out well there except Marissa & Ryan are exiled from Harbour thanks to a new Dean of Discipline and his student sidekick Taylor.  Ryan gets back in eventually after a brief stint of homeschooling (aka visiting Marissa all the time) while Marissa attends public school and befriends some surfers, Johnny and Chilly.  Eventually Johnny quite predictably falls in love with Marissa, who remains loyal to Ryan, but some disasterous results eventually tear the 3 of them apart.  Meanwhile Seth and Summer are figuring out their college plans, or lack thereof, Julie is searching for her next sugar daddy, Sandy is a corporate bigwig running the Newport Group, and Kirsten is...doing nothing.

One additional frustrating thing about this season is that a big focus is of course on senior year and college (although in theory if you watch season 1 the show started in grade 11 so season 2 was grade 11 and a 1/2 I guess).  Yet if you bother going on to S4, college is a nonentity!

In terms of special features, I haven't gotten through them all yet but there is a few ""pass the remote"" features, in other words, commentaries with Josh Schwartz the show's creator and various others.  The gag reel isn't quite as funny as past years, and the Subways 'making of' is kind of dumb other than to see a few of the sets in a different way.

Overall, a purchase only for the die-hard OC fan (I got mine on sale for $20).  It'll break your heart to watch the show that rocked us so much in season 1, and more or less in season 2...and don't even get me started on season 4.",1185494400,,3446,4.501607717041801

Each season is less than stellar compared to the previous season and season three is no different, but it's still got a strong enough hook to reel you in.

I was happy to see Kirsten and Sandy the main O.C. parents level back out and become that strong power couple again the way they were in Season 1.  The shows writers had made them rocky on Season 2 which seemed completely out of character for them.  Julie Cooper heads down a financial decline which you wouldn't have minded to watch in Season 1 when she deserved it, but by Season 3 she had become so likable it wasn't that pleasant to endure.  It started off sad, but they soon made it comedic.  As for the kids story lines, I could tell it was getting a little tired as the writers stretched to create ridiculous drama that would never happen in real life.

You know it's lazy writing when you have characters showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time to hear or witness something they shouldn't.  Because that never happens in real life.  They introduced a meddling Dean at the High School that seemed forced to the point where they had him targeting the lead cast members to make their lives miserable.  Yeah that happens right?

The Ryan and Marissa relationship seems to continue despite them both constantly getting the wrong idea of what the other is up to.  It doesn't help that Marissa latches onto every helpless boy she comes across to the point that it almost seems inappropriate if you're involved with someone else.  That boy is Johnny the surfer friend who develops a crush on Marissa.  That got tired real fast.  I don't know what the writers were thinking by dragging this Johnny character I'm one episode after another.  He overstayed his welcome after the second episode he was in.  Everytime you turned around he was showing up at someone's door feeling melodramatic and persistently sad that he can't have Marissa.

Caleb's departure was oddly missed as well too.  Jimmy Cooper surfaces in the beginning, but is quickly or conveniently written out again as they drag his financial troubled storyline.  Kirsten's miraculous turnaround after rehab was welcomed and nice to see the Cohen's strong and going again.

The High School scenes with the kids was getting exhausting by this season.  Especially since I couldn't figure out why they were all still in High School.  I figured them for seniors in season 1.  Maybe that's because the actors playing the kids were well into their twenties and pushing nearly 30 by the time season 4 rolled around.  It was great to see a bit more of Summers Dad as we know all about the other lead kids parents.  Although what was odd is Marissa is staying at Summers house but sleeping in the same bed as her.  They're fighting over using the same mirror?  What is odd about that is its not like they don't have any other room in that house.  Summer lives in a mansion.

Despite the criticisms I still loved the show and this season, but the tiredness of dragging the forced drama and storylines was becoming more apparent in this season.  The writing was sloppy and the dialogue had become mundane.  It's not surprising that the show ended abruptly in season 4.  Most know the Marissa character played by Mischa Barton makes her radical exit at the end of season 3 through death. It was Mischa's decision to leave the O.C. to pursue a movie career which never came to light.  She should've stayed on the O.C. and milked it since that's when her popularity started and peaked all in one show.  Her character's death was unnecessary.  They really wanted to make sure she didn't come back.  She was already going to go sailing with her dad for a year.  The writers should've left that alone and keep the door open for the fans.  When you kill off a lead character in a show like this, you're literally killing the show itself, which is what happened in Season 4 where the ratings dropped astronomically prompting to cancel the show eight episodes short.",1179792000,,4254,4.5949535192563085

Taylor was a bit annoying, but the scandal with her and the dean was a great twist.

This show has something for everybody; drama, humor, romance, excitement. Who really doesn't enjoy a good fight between Ryan and Volchek?

You still have Ryan, Seth, Summer, and Marissa. You get Taylor thrown into the mix, which is pretty fun to watch. The storylines are not as great as the first 2 seasons but thats mostly due to all the different writers and Josh Schwartz not writing as much as he used to.

Storylines were never the strongpoint for that show. It became painfully apparent when the only gimmick was to bring in some usually downright unlikable outsider to shake things up between either Ryan and Marissa or Summer and Seth. How many times did we grimace each time another was introduced, only to flit away into oblivion or die. There are other ways to resolve things, guys. And there are other events in life to explore and to showcase, to develop - not just kill.

Speaking of development, character development is one thing, complete character overhaul is another. While Seth and Summer's witty banter and scathing remarks continued throughout the entire duration of the show (thank God for something), Summer's transition into a Bohemian Brown-attendee just took from her original charm. Marissa never really did have much to say, but at least have her not say it whilst in Ryan's arms out by the sea as a pretty song plays.

Sigh. We'll always have Season 1.",1172102400,3,1149,4.763819095477387

Say it with me folks: THE TREND IS OVER AND GONE FOREVER!!

2621053,3,B000GYI32M,"I found the OC to be a very entertaining show the first season. The second season, although not as great as the first, was also fun to watch. The third season was bit of a disappointment, but since I had spent the first two seasons watching, I figured I should continue. Although I found a lot of the new characters to be part of the downfall for the season, I figured that the OC had had its run, and that it was time for it to end. I felt that they had done everything they could have with it and I truly thought that the OC was over and that there wouldn't be a fourth season.

In my opinion, it would have been fine to end the show at Marissa's death. For instance, fans would have been left with Summer going to Brown, and Seth following her to Rhode Island a few months later. Sandy would have left the New Port Group, and gone back to being a great public defender and upstanding father and husband. Julie would have been thrust back into the ""Newpsie"" scene as the new love interest of Summer's father. Caitlin would have been back to reunite with her family, etc, etc. I personally didn't find Marissa's death so terrible. Marissa's character had had a full run. In less than 2 years, she had lost her virginity, smoked, blacked out on several occassions, OD'd in TJ, had three serious boyfriends,got accepted to a great college, and tried a hand full of other drugs. She was pretty much done. The death of Marissa should have been the end of the show. This change would have left die-hard fans of the show thinking that Ryan would forever be in love with his now lost forever, Marissa.

Viewers wouldn't have had to be thrust into this fourth season nonsense, which in my opinion, is absolute garbage. I don't understand how people can say that the fourth season is taking on the same heart that made the first season so strong. It isn't funny anymore. You have an annoying girl clinging to Ryan and there really is no chemistry there, Summer has completely reformed herself and not in a good way (I miss the spoiled, shallow Summer). Seth also has lost a lot of the gumption, sarcasm, and humor that really defined ""Cohen."" Finally, Caitlin is trying to take over and completely cast out what was clearly Marissa's place in Newport Beach, and it isn't working.

The third season had potential, but didn't really achieve any. I felt that the writers got bored with the OC itself. The characters weren't as interesting, became more irritating, and their quick departures whether that be because of some crime related incident or death only left a mess afterwards (i.e. the death of Johnny pretty much screwed things over for everyone. Ryan became conflicted about Marissa. He questioned going to college again. Marissa also questioned college. Then, they both started awkward relationships).I can understand why the writers chose to make Marissa far more conflicted in this season than she was in others. It was clear that Mischa Barton was going to leave the show early on in the season. However, the one thing that this season still does deliver is a decent soundtrack, and music during the show. It lived up to its musical potential. If you are an extreme OC fan, then it would worth it to buy it to add to your collection.",1168732800,,3235,4.564543889845095

2621090,5,B000GYI32M,"Okay, so season three of my favorite primetime soap opera, The O.C., wasn't nearly up to snuff with the spectacular first season and the slightly less spectacular second season. But, despite that, I still tuned in every Thursday night and when the DVDs were released, I bought them and relived the season again.

While the third season was a bit of a letdown in a number of ways, I will say that a month into the fourth season, The O.C. has regained its form and is shining. It's just too bad that it is up against the two strongest shows on television, CSI and Grey's Anatomy. Despite all that, season four is looking to be the best season since the phenomenal first season.

My opinion on why the third season was a bit of a letdown is the fact that creator Josh Schwartz seems to have taken a back seat in this season. He was the one with the vision for the show and its fantastic inaugural season and without him in his prominent position (or so it seems), the show wasn't quite the same.

Unfortunately, the show continued to introduce unlikeable characters in the third season, much as they had in the first two seasons. This takes away from the great relationships that make the show so good, the Sandy and Kirsten, Summer and Seth, Ryan and Marissa and Julie and her man of the week, storylines.

Season three picked up a short while after the shocking season two finale left off. As we left them, Marissa (Mischa Barton) had just shot Ryan's (Ben McKenzie) brother Trey (guest star Logan Marshall Green) as the two brothers fought. Fearing for Ryan's life, Marissa pulled the trigger just moments before Seth (Adam Brody) and Summer (the absolutely gorgeous Rachel Bilson) walked through the door.

Trey had been nothing but trouble since his arrival in Newport Beach in season two. He had betrayed Ryan and the Cohen family, attacked Marissa and gotten into a boatload of trouble. The gunshot didn't kill him, but left him in a coma. Marissa's role in the shooting was questioned, as Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke), still reeling from the death of her second husband Caleb Nicol at the end of season two, tried to pay off Trey to implicate Ryan and spare Marissa. The ploy didn't work and Trey rode off into the sunset on a Greyhound bus.

But, the implications from the shooting lived on, as both Marissa and Ryan were expelled from the Harbor School. While Ryan was readmitted, Marissa spent most of the season at Newport Union, the local public school, where she met even more people that would play a significant role in the rest of the season.

The start of the season also found Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) in rehab, where she had been admitted at the end of season two, as Sandy (Peter Gallagher), Ryan and Seth tried to cope with her out of the house. Kirsten met Charlotte (guest star Jeri Ryan) in rehab and she would also play a big role in the early part of the season.

The Marissa-Ryan story line again took some strange turns, as has been the case in the first two years. Her banishment to Newport Union found her hanging with new friends, particularly surfer Johnny (guest star Ryan Donowho), which brought out a little jealousy in Ryan. The two were on and off for much of the season, with Marissa hooking up with bad-boy Volchok (guest star Cam Gigandet), a former friend of Johnny's, after Johnny fell off a cliff to his death in front of Marissa, Ryan and Marissa's younger sister Caitlin (guest star and future series regular Willa Holland). His death also led to the introduction of his cousin Sadie (guest star Nikki Reed). Sadie and Ryan had a brief relationship, but his acceptance at college kind of turned things around as she headed off into the sunset. Marissa eventually returns to Harbor, thanks to a little help from an unlikely ally, Taylor Townsend (guest star and future series regular Autumn Reeser, who is Summer's top competition for most beautiful woman on television).

While Marissa was at Newport Union, her mother Julie was searching for a way to get back on her feet. Caleb's will left her with no money and because of that, her attempt to reunite with her former husband and Marissa's dad, Jimmy Cooper (guest star Tate Donovan) failed and Julie was forced to move into a trailer park, while Marissa bunked at Summer's house. Of course Julie wasn't down for long, as she quickly became cozy with Summer's dad Neil (guest star Michael Nouri) and the two became engaged near the end of the season. Julie and Kirsten also started a high end match making business that remains part of the show in season four.

With Kirsten in rehab, the management of the Newport Group is left to Sandy and he finds himself caught between his morals and big business as he strives to build a new hospital. Kirsten's return home isn't all roses either, as she brings Charlotte to town and with that comes a whole load of trouble, as she tries to bilk first Kirsten and then Julie, out of money. She ultimately fails and disappears without a trace, thankfully. The hospital deal eats into Sandy's time and causes a lot of stress on his marriage. His decision to back out of the deal at the end of the season shows that he is back to the old Sandy.

The core relationship in season three was the Summer-Seth storyline. With college on the horizon, Summer worries that Seth's desire to get as far away from Newport as possible will pull them apart. But, when Summer aces her SATs, much to Seth's surprise, the two apply to Brown together. Seth doesn't get in and not wanting to stop Summer from going, he breaks up with her. Of course, this devastates both of them, and comes to head at prom, where Summer tries to drink away her problems. Seth, determined to win back the love of his life, heads to Brown for student orientation, bound to find a way in. While there, he runs into Anna (guest star Samaire Armstrong), a blast from the first season past. While they can't concoct a plan to get Seth into Brown, Anna finds an alternative in the Rhode Island School of Design, and then proceeds to help Summer and Seth get back together again.

As mentioned, this season continued the introduction of characters that just aren't likeable. Volchok and Charlotte come to mind as the two worst offenders. Johnny played the role of Oliver in season one, the person who came between Ryan and Marissa. Thankfully, all the characters were written out of the show at the end of the season or at the beginning of season four.

The shocking finale (though it wasn't as shocking as it could've been had Mischa Barton not gone on television and told the world that she was being killed off), brought viewers back to the first season, as Ryan carried Marissa away from the burning car, much like he carried her out of an ally in Tijuana two years earlier. The effects of her death are felt strongly in season four, as the main characters try to carry on without her.

This set had some interesting bonus features. The making of the Subways music video was a short piece on the band's appearance on the show. What's in a Name was an interesting feature showing how Josh Schwartz uses people he knows and staffers on the show to name characters on the show. There is a solid gag reel, a making of an episode featurette and an interesting take on commentary. Viewers listen to Schwartz and other staff members talk about certain scenes in two different episodes. It's not one whole episode of commentary, but it is still interesting to hear some behind the scenes stuff.

While the show itself hit a bump in the road during season three, the DVD set was well done and the packaging was significantly better than that for season two. Now if only the ratings would pick up for an excellent season four, things would be all good in The O.C.",1165276800,20,7742,4.587852494577007

It quite possibily was one of the dumbest moves I have seen. While ""The OC"" is looking very promising in the few episodes I've seen of Season 4, it makes you ask yourself...""Why the hell did they go in that direction""?

Yes, it's not quite as good as the first two seasons, but to me, Season 3 is more like a case of the show ""being good enough to tune in every week"".  Nothing really memorable happens until the very end, but the characters maintain their interesting way of going through life and school, in my opinion.

So in the end, I was glad I tuned in to Season 3 every week because I ended up liking everything that was happening.  Don't be fooled by the reviews- it's not a bad season, it's just not as good as it could have been.  If you liked Seasons 1 and 2, you should look into it.",1163116800,3,631,4.139344262295082

Not only is one of the worst shows trying to look like one of the best shows, it doesn't help to copy artwork from the cover of a friends season DVD set!",1162339200,,279,4.090909090909091
2621119,3,B000GYI32M,"I'm a 23 year old male and I love the O.C. I try to never miss a week of the show and I try to keep up with all of the main characters. I loved the first season of this show. Creator Josh Schwartz made a show that was honest, geniune, comedic and dramatic all at the same time. Ryan, Seth, Summer and Marissa were the type of people you saw in high school: clingy, quirky and ever so lost and confused going through the high school life. Sandy and Kirstin have more of the typical marriage I am used to seeing: it's not perfect, but deep down they still love each other like crazy and will always be there for each other. They also are good parents to Ryan and Seth. This show was just a great show. It did a good job of getting rid of main characters that were unnecessary (Luke) and ending characters that ran a good time with the show (Caleb Nichol, Jimmy Cooper).

The third season of the O.C. is not on the same level as season two and definitely not on the same level as one. Creator Schwartz took a break from being the head-runner for the show, and you can definitely see that in the quality of writing. The beginning episodes are just irritating. The characters of Charlotte (Jeri Ryan, normally I love her work, but didn't feel her in this role), Dean Haus (Eric Marbus, who is doing an awesome job on ""Ugly Betty"".), and Taylor Townsend were all annoying and took too much focus off of the main characters. Luckily, Charlotte and the Dean were dropped, but Taylor remained. Though she eventually went from a nemisis to a friend, I still had trouble accepting her in a recurring role. Marissa once again was the center of all that was dramatic in the O.C. She first was kicked out of school, then befriended a surfer named Johnny, who has a crush on her yet is friends with Ryan, Johnny dies in an accident, Marissa then hooks up with Johnny's rival Volcheck, by far and away the worst character of this season. Volcheck pushes every single button on Ryan, causing much grief in his life.  Marissa then must deal with her sister Catlin returning to the O.C. She is by far and away the character with the most conflicts and drama during the season.

However, that doesn't mean the others go unnoticed. Kirstin deals with staying sober and starting a new career with Julie. Sandy takes over the Newport Group and almost becomes the man he despises, Caleb Nichol. Seth runs into problems with telling the truth and being straightforward with others. Summer worries about Seth and their relationship with the future of college. Julie goes from the rich house to the trailer park before embarking on a new relationship. Jimmy Cooper makes a return before departing once again. Ryan tries to move on from Marissa and focus on college, but always seems to be there to clean up her mess and take care of her as usual. The ending on the season finale is one of the most shocking in recent television history.

The overabundance of annoying characters, plus the underwritten stories for characters like Seth, Ryan and Summer bothered me a bit. However, season 4 could be better. Schwartz is said to be back as the head-runner for the show, and Catlin Cooper becomes a main part of the cast. It'll hopefully help the O.C. bounce back after a dud-like third season.",1162252800,,3263,4.506756756756757
2621120,4,B000GYI32M,"Can you keep a secret? I love the OC. I'm a 28 year old man who has been infatuated with the stupid plots, inane dialog, and ridiculous characters this show has to offer. This season is absolutely NOT a let down. The only problem I can think of is that there isn't enough Seth Cohen. Aside from that, the show delivers exactly what it promises. While I will admit that this is no season 1, I would say that its actually better than season 2. The other reviewers may have been expecting some ground-breaking, innovative television experience, but that is insane. This is the freaking OC people! The show isn't ""Masterpiece Theater"" it's about rich kids and a flock of ever-changing ancillary characters finding themselves in impossible situations week after week. If you are thinking about this purchase, then you've seen the previous seasons and know what to expect. I am here to reassure you that its OK to pull the trigger on this one; you won't regret it. Oh, and be carefull, some of the other reviews give away the ending which is a total A-hole move.",1161907200,,1056,4.622340425531915

that never happened. and it probably won't happen next season either, but that won't stop me from watching. I love this show.  Yeah, Killing Marissa was a dumb idea, even though I disliked her, but it was dumb- she was in the core group.

I love this show. I love Seth,Summer, Sandy, Ryan, Kirsten,Julie... I love the original lineup.  the fact that next season is going to follow kaitlin pisses me off. She is not that great of a character,she was annoying last season and she will be this season.  But, Seth/Summer will still be there, same with Sandy, Ryan & co. so it cant be that awful.

Season 3 is definitely not as good as season 1 or 2, but hey, its still going to make big bucks.  Fans are going to buy it because thatst just what we do. Season 2 wasn't all that, but I still bought it.  It sucks that this bright, hilarious, mind-blowing every week program is now this dull, predictable, dud.....

This show has the potential to be just as good as its' first season.

I'll get off my soapbox now and get back to the point... If your even looking at these reviews, obviously you're a fan and you've been watching since the beginning.  you love this show even if it disappoints you. it's like a relationship. you love what it use to be, you love the familiar faces, and you keep going back even if it lets you down.  so stop reading these reviews, if you've got the money- buy it.

its not the most awful thing out on shelves. it's the OC. and The OC= Seth Cohen. Sandy Cohen. Summer Roberts. Ryan Atwood. Julie Cooper. Kirsten Cohen.and oh yeah-marissa (for the fans of that one out there) and they are amazing and they make the show.",1161561600,2,1857,4.363372093023256

2621143,2,B000GYI32M,"The only reaosn this show gets more than one star is because at the very least you can see that money is spent on it. the presentation is solid.
however,
if i wanted to watch (let alone buy) a series which is centered around a bunch of wanking rich kids i would walk around at the highschool i graduated from 7 years ago.
its all the same uninteresting [...] that people escape come graduation time senior year.
ive listened to scattered episodes from several seasons as background noise after whatever i was watching before it, but the show itself is aweful.
like i said, a bunch of rich kids with nothing to gripe about, griping about nothing. bottom line: [...] happens. you either get passed it, or you dont.
maybe my take on it is skewed by living (born and raised) in santa barbara CA which is about 2 hours north of the (real) OC, but is riddled with the same kinds of rich-kid problems.
i would rather kill my time watching grass grow than sit down and actually watch this kind of dribble.
do yourself a favor: read a book rather than buying the DVDs of the OC",1161129600,,1068,4.371859296482412

2621145,3,B000GYI32M,"I have been watching ""The OC"" since the very first episode.  In the beginning I literally feel in love with the characters, the amazing plot lines, and the spectacular writing.  It wasn't the fact that ""the OC"" was a posh television series, while I loved it - it was because it was one of the very few series that I could find characters that I identitfy.  Unlike 'Dawson's Creek' or 'Beverly Hills 90210,' 'The OC' had characters that could have been my friends, they where so alike to the typical teenagers of present time... I'm not saying everyone is rich and beautiful, but the are insecure, klingy, and come with baggage.

The third season of the series though had a definate drop in quality.  The creator took a backseat for the year, and the quality definately reflects his decision.  While all the characters have major choices and decisions in their lives - this is senior year afterall - its all left with an odd feeling behind.

Senior Year is suppose to be full of life-altnerning decisions and events and the series seems to kinda gloss over all these facts...  The episodes in the season include:

The End of Innocence

The Last Waltz

The Perfect Storm

2621146,4,B000GYI32M,"I think Season 3 was a bit better than Season 2, where I  found the Ryan/Lindsay relationship boring (and implausible, when Lindsay is found to be Caleb's daughter) and just a way of filling in time before the Ryan/Marissa relationship resurfaced. Season 3 did at least focus more on the main characters. I'm glad that Marissa got killed off because I found her an increasingly stupid and unsympathetic character - everyone except her can see that Johnny and Volchek are no good for her and it will end in tears. It became predictable.

I liked the way the Seth/Summer relationship was a constant. It was these two (plus the wonderful Julie) who provide the humour the show needs.

My biggest disappointment was that Ben Mckenzie's part was so underwritten. The show should return to focussing on him. That's where it started. The First Series was great, particularly the pilot where Ben did a marvellous job at showing a potentially complex and conflicted character, ranging from adolescent and broody to sweet and romantic. I believe Ben Mckenzie is an actor with great potential but this show is not stretching him. I'd like to see him speak more (not just through his eyes), express his character's views more clearly and really unlock emotionally. And give him more humorous lines! He is the lynchpin of the show, but sadly his role has been overshadowed by too many ephemeral and two-dimensional characters. Time for a new direction Josh, or don't be surprised if Mr Mckenzie moves on to better things.",1158624000,6,1508,4.8828125

As most people know, the season ends tragically. Which isn't such a bad idea. They lose someone who wouldn't make much of a story in season 4 if (he/she) kept living. I thought it was tragic that they left, but it's time for the show to move on. Also the creators of Season 3 got a new Katlin. That's a dissapoitment, just like they got a new Trey in season 2. The actors that replaced them are good, just it's silly they are replaced in the first place. They need to hire someone for the part and stick to them.
