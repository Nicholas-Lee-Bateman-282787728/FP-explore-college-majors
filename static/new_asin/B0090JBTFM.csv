5200932,5,B0090JBTFM,"Dead in Tombstone was completed in 2012, but post production problems delayed the release date until Oct. 2013. It was well worth the wait! The movie reminds of the short lived TV Show 'Brimstone' where a damned soul earns redemption by tracking down other damned souls and sending them back to Hell. In 'Dead in Tombstone' a leader of an outlaw gang is murdered by his own gang and for all the sins of his life he is sent to Hell. Once there he makes a deal with the Devil to deliver the souls of the six men who killed him in exchange for his own salvation. The movie starts with the Black Water Gang breaking one of their members out of prison. As each member is introduced with a close up, a wanted poster for that outlaw appears. It's a great way to introduce the gang. Danny Trejo plays Guerrero Hernamdez leader of the gang. Anthony Michael Hall plays his lieutenant and Mickey Rourke plays a stellar role as the Devil. After the break out Hall tells Trejo about a bank job in Colorado that could have the gang set for life. So the gang rides to Colorado and they hit the bank. After the deed is done Hall wants to take over the gang and he shoots Trejo. The rest of the gang joins in and Trejo is murdered.
  Once in Hell Trejo makes a deal with the Devil to kill the six men who betrayed him in exchange for his salvation. The Devil accepts under two conditions, 1st Trejo only has 24 hours to deliver them to him and all six must die by his hand. So starts a 24-hour non-stop action thrill ride. I waited over a year for this movie and I was not disappointed. It was well worth the wait. I will not give a way the ending, but a possible sequel or series of sequels was set up. The special features include Deleted Scenes, Deleted Scenes Montage, Making of dead in Tombstone Featurette, and a Feature Commentary. The disc also includes the R-Rated Version and the Unrated Version. I believe the Blue Ray version of this movie has a few additional special features.",1382486400,,1973,4.3297297297297295
5200933,4,B0090JBTFM,"The film opens with a grindhouse rescue of a member of the Blackwater Gang about to be hung. The gang members are introduced by a decent western/bayou soundtrack (Hybrid)using wanted posters. The gang opts to rob a Colorado mining town of its disputed gold, except Red (Anthony Michael Hall) has plans of taking over the town instead of fleeing to the dismay of his half brother Guerrero (Danny Trejo) who soon becomes Swiss Cheese.

Like so many Trejo films, he dies early on, except in this one he is still in the film as he works out a deal with the devil (Mickey Rourke) to return and kill the six gang members in 24 hours. This is something he could have done in the first 10 minutes, but that wouldn't make for the last second drama. Calathea (Dina Meyer) whose husband was killed by the gang plays a wildcard in this as the deal includes Trejo killing the men by his own hand.

Great film for Trejo fans as he returns to his grindhouse roots.

Parental Guide (unrated version): F-bomb, saloon girl nudity, no sex.",1382400000,18,1020,4.5027027027027025
5200934,5,B0090JBTFM,"Some of the stars include Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Anthony Michael Hall & a number of folks you've likely never heard of tell a familiar tale of outlaws and their evil plans on the good citizens trying to build a new life.  A bucolic town in the hills of Colorado spark a debate over mineral rights that engulf all of it's citizens & an outlaw gang set on liberating the booty for their own purposes.  Trejo is betrayed by those closest to him and the Unholy of the Underworld cuts him a deal to settle the score, but like any form of gambling there's a high chance of the house fleecing you on the best deal!  A good blend of drama, action, western & horror genres.",1381449600,17,669,4.2936507936507935
5200935,2,B0090JBTFM,"""I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna take over this town and you can go to hell."" When a gang lead by Guerrero (Trejo) enters a small mining town for a night of drinking he is surprised when the gang revolts and kills him in order to stay and control the town they now call Tombstone. When he wakes up in Hell he makes a deal with the Devil in order to live again. Now has an instrument of Satan all he has to do is kill the gang that killed him or face eternal damnation. Once again this is a Danny Trejo movie which means this will be a short review. His fans will watch this either way so what I will say is that this is pretty cheesy with a ridiculous plot. On the other hand this does have Trejo in it for more then 5 minutes and Mickey Rourke is also in this for added fun. This is a true western in the way that there are no zombies or other gimmick to make people watch. Other then that this is another movie for Trejo fans. Overall, not terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I give it a C+.",1380758400,5,1004,3.926470588235294
5200936,1,B0090JBTFM,"Where to begin? This is a sweaty ball-sack of a movie that plays like the low budget CGI video sequences from a 1990's video game. Imagine a movie populated by a stable of aging male porn stars in all of their athletic sock wearing glory, and you'll have some idea of how bad this film really is. There are a lot of gun shootout sequences with members of the cast constantly diving for cover, but I think it was their desire to minimize their on-screen time that has so many of the cast hiding behind available furniture. Mickey Rourk looks like a refuge from a gay porno flick, and I kept expecting him to torture other cast members in some ill conceived anal rape sequence.  My advice would be to spend the time you would wast on this film picking your feet and smelling toe cheese.",1380326400,6,784,4.36986301369863

5200938,5,B0090JBTFM,DEAD IN TOMBSTONE has the makings of a cult classic. Danny Trejo gives a gritty performance in this devil may care tale of revenge. Danny Trejo's trip from beyond the grave is spellbinding in every sense of the word. Mickey Rourke's Satanic presence is an absolute send up as only Rourke can give you.

5200946,1,B0090JBTFM,"I love Danny Trejo, but what a waste.... I didn't expect this to be a Rodriguez classic, but I thought it might be a bit more like the hilarious over-the-top Machete series. Instead it was just really bad! Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing - about the only thing good was the set. The result is a story without a clear direction of what it wants to be; a movie with the heart of a casual, cheesy horror flick that flirts with taking itself too seriously as a Western drama. The result was like watching a porn movie with bad plot but without the nudity or sex.

The script was terribly corny (maybe the intended humor), and to add insult to injury it was usually delivered stiffly like a bad high-school production, without any sense of the actors staying in character (after all this was supposed to be something like 150 years ago). Mickey Rourke (as the Devil) and the whole Blackwater Gang were especially cringe-worthy. Only some of the town extras and Trejo (as the scar-faced betrayed leader of the Blackwater Gang) and Dina Meyer (as the beautiful wife of the town sheriff) were any good with their parts - and Trejo is good only because he's Trejo. This was one of those movies where the best thing about it was how good it made better movies seem.",1513382400,,1262,4.510917030567685

5200967,4,B0090JBTFM,"I like Danny Trejo but I'll admit I wasn't expecting this one to really be worth anything. However, 'Tombstone' is surprisingly good, fast paced and leaves you wondering if Trejo's character (an outlaw killed by his own men after one last robbery) is going to be able to fulfill the terms of his contract with the Devil (played fairly viciously by Mickey Rourke). There's a number of suspenseful moments and the female lead is more than capable of handling herself and the ways the outlaw gang are dealt with are fitting, and there's a twist at the end that makes you hope that someday, there's a sequel. Definitely a movie worth picking up.",1492214400,2,641,4.68141592920354

5200982,4,B0090JBTFM,"""Dead in Tombstone"" involves an outlaw betrayed by his own gang. We've all seen this trope before in dozens of Westerns. The twist is that Danny Trejo's outlaw deals with the Devil himself in order to exact revenge (and a little justice along the way).

This film isn't Oscar winning material, straight up. What ""Dead in Tombstone"" does offer is plenty of stylized action, unique camera shots, and a nice dark, cinematic look. The film/DVD also isn't lacking in the action department. The cast works well withing their respective characters (Mickey Rourke as the Devil? Oh yeah, he had some fun with this role).

If you're a fan of Westerns, the supernatural or general action flicks, then go ahead and give ""Dead in Tombstone"" a try. It's not a bad popcorn film.",1477094400,,763,4.7727272727272725

5200993,4,B0090JBTFM,"This film deserves five stars for the action in the film, but only three stars for the manner in which the plot develops, so I gave it four stars. The plot itself, while it is far from rational, is ok. A gang leader is killed by his half-brother because the half-brother disagrees with the leader. The leader wants to take all the money in the town and leave, but his half-brother wants to stay, take over the town, rape its women, and milk it for more gold and money. The gang leader ends up in Hell and makes a deal with the devil. If the devil revives him, he will kill the six members of his gang, and the devil will have them sooner than expected. The devil agrees to the deal on condition that only the leader must kill the six, and must do it within 24 hours. If he succeeds, he will not have to return to Hell. The leaders problem is that one of the gang shot the town sheriff and his wife wants revenge, want to kill the six. If she does so, the leader must remain in Hell.
What bothered me is that it seemed to me that the leader could have accomplished his goal in less than an hour, but the film makers drew out the killings to make a better drama.",1469664000,,1160,4.092105263157895

5201030,4,B0090JBTFM,"Lately I have become a fan of Danny Trejo, having seen him in a number of films in the past almost always a bad guy role.  I recently purchased this DVD (Dead in Tombstone) starring Danny Trejo as Guerrero Hernandez, and Mickey Rourke, as the devil.  Guerrero is part of a gang and after he is shot numerous times by his brother  (Anthony Michael Hall), the rest of the gang, he dies and meets Satan in hell.  Guerrero makes  a deal with the devil that if Guerrero kills the other six gang members in a certain period of time his own soul will be saved.

This is a real gritty and dark western combining, violence and revenge along with some mysticism with the devil himself.  In some ways this film reminded me of one of my other favorite western movie with a similar theme called Purgatory.  Dead in Tombstone is a lot darker and there is a lot more of shooting action in this film.

If you are an action movie fan and like Danny Terejo you should check out this DVD. I found it an action packed interesting film.

5201058,4,B0090JBTFM,"You can't go wrong with Danny Trejo.  Even if the rest of a movie stinks, he was great in it.  And in the noble brotherhood of actors who die in all or nearly all of their films (shared with Sean Bean) Danny not only dies once, but twice, possibly three times.  Take that, Sean Bean.

But this film is great.  Despite the premise, a wronged outlaw returns from hell to get revenge on his killers, this is not really a horror film.  The only thing that breaches the concept of horror is the costume they gave Mickey Rourke.

Mickey Rourke.  Once one of my favorite actors.  His butchered face lift makes it painful to even look at him.  Thanks to not having a connection between his muscles and the skin on his face, it is rarely easy to tell what he is thinking.  He falls well short of effective as the devil.  Nothing scary.  Your worst fear is that his beer gut will break through his vest and a flying button will put out your eye.

Now if you are cast with Danny Trejo, but it is YOUR face that looks scarred, you need to look into another appointment.  I really would have rather had Gabriel Burn or Al Pacino, both brilliant devils in their own right. (End of Days, The Devil's Advocate, respectively)

Anthony Michael Hall makes a very convincing bad guy.  Gone are the days of the wimpy nerd.  He is 3-D and yet, devoid of saving graces.

The ending leaves the door open for a sequel or even a franchise.  If they ditch Mickey I will follow it.",1438300800,,1453,4.291512915129151

I own three of them now, Gallow Walkers with Wesley Snipes, Purgatory with Sam Shepard and now Dead in Tombstone. I think Purgatory had the best storyline.  Gallow Walkers has the best action and Dead in Tombstone is somewhere between the two. The acting is bad but that is too be expected with Mickey Rourke and Danny Trejo starring. The plot is basic without surprises, so that leaves the action. I have only watched the Unrated version so far and the action was good and plentiful.

But this film didn't cut it, partially due to lack of female nudity, partially due to lack of graphic gore, and partially due to lack of budget for background sets.  I've never actually been to hell I will admit, but I have a suspicion that hell is a tad more ominous, and Satan should have been a bit more Sci-Fi / Fantasy enhanced to convince the viewer that the prince of darkness is nothing more than a lazy fat bastard who is into S & M or B & D only a wee little bit.  Let's get past the potential of the cast that falls short by a mile and simply admit that ""Machete"" is a thousand times better.  Somebody was in a hurry when this film was made, and let far too much of the gold dust fall through the cracks in the floor.
Seriously reminiscent of dating back in Jr High School, because I wish I could know what I do today and go back to that opportunity to get it right this time.

5201222,5,B0090JBTFM,"I won't repeat what it says on the back of the dvd package but this movie takes place in the wild west.  Suffice it to say, Mr. Rourke is typecast as the devil himself, and our majestic hero, Mr. Trejo, plays an avenging angel.  I don't know if it is a coincidence that Mr. Trejo's horse's name was ""George"" (he's starring with another ""George"" in the Saint George sit-com), but he was beautiful--as was Mr,Trejo.  In this story, Mr. Trejo is tasked with killing his former murderous and generally unsavory criminal gang in exchange for escaping hell and damnation. He only needed to kill 6 people, but I'd say the body count was probably about 4 times that.  Too bad Rourke didn't give him extra credit for volume. Michael Anthony Hall (whom I've loved since his days in Sixteen Candles and Dead Zone) was gleefully evil in his role as the arch villain.  There is a lovely lady heroine which unfortunately(for Mr Trejo) doesn't turn out to be a love interest for him but did a good job as the virtuous widow of the town's deceased lawman.  Mr. Rourke materializes periodically throughout the movie in various scenes making himself known at first in Mr. Trejo's nightmares (mine, too, actually).  There is a lot of gore with my favorite scene involving showing Mr. Trejo from the back in a seated position apparently nude(guess they buried him naked because that was how he climbed out of his grave) when he fires some sort of cannon type gun and blows a person's head into smithereens. Unfortunately (for me anyway) he locates his clothing, dresses, grabs George the horse (who remembers him) and is off on his adventure to murder his entire former gang.  There is a very brief ""titillating"" (emphasis on the ""tit"" part) scene where a young half naked lady runs across the screen, wearing nothing but her ruffled knickers and her knockers (surgically enhanced of course.)

My favorite scene for Mr. Trejo (hard to pick but seemed realistic) was him leaping off his beautiful black steed as the steed was falling and was sliding sideways . He stuck that landing very well.  Unfortunately, due to recent ""work"", Mr. Rourke mainly looked astonished (and with really dirty scruffy hair) instead of evil, and our wonderful Mr. Trejo makes this movie worth watching. Perhaps Mr. Trejo can give Mr. Rourke some hair washing and hair combing tips if Mr. Rourke continues to wear his hair long like Mr. Trejo does.

This is another keeper for my Trejo collection!",1398384000,,2455,4.752941176470588
5201223,5,B0090JBTFM,"I viewed the Rated version  but since that one isn't listed, I'm posting my opinions here.  When I ordered this, I was a litle hesitant because I expected it to be pure grindhouse but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. I got that but more also. Granted there is plenty of violence but there's a fairly coherent storyline through it also.  An outlaw is double-crossed by his gang and killed, ending up in Hell where he makes a deal with the Devil to deliver his killers so he can go free. Deal with the devil? Expect a double-cross. Right?  He lines up six empty coffins in front of the church and proceeds to fill each one while the devil looks on as a bystander.  This movie was entertaining and well-acted with some very artistic camera work though I could've done with fewer slow-motion shots. Since most of the action takes place at night, we get few scenery shots but the couple they show make the Transylvanian countryside (where this was shot) look very much like some US Western locale. There's little characterization but then the action's the thing.

All in all, it's a very good movie and once I'll probably watch a few more times.",1397692800,,1143,4.497584541062802

5201231,3,B0090JBTFM,"Bland. Average. Mediocre.  Need I say more? ...Not really, but to provide a fair review,  I'll elaborate ...

As a fan of the ""Machete"" flicks, also starring Danny Trejo, and on the account of this being a revenge type flick (similar to a ""Kill Bill"" movie), I had expectations of this being an entertaining B movie. This Western did not deliver any of the goods expected - not even for a B movie. No scenes really stood out as memorable. The action, humor, and overall acting was mediocre at best. Trejo didn't even appear as a proficient gun slinger - his quick draws seemed somewhat jerky and one would think his character would be killed ten times over with skills like his. Even with a little twist at the end, the storyline plays into a very typical Western flick. No 'surprises' go without already being easily foreseen by the viewer.  And basically, there's nothing much new in this Western that hasn't been done before.
Had Trejo's character been more creative in knocking off his fellow gang members,  this movie could have had some potential - but, again, it just kept on being just another bland movie. Sorry,  Danny ... this one's just 2.5 to 3 stars at best.",1394064000,,1172,4.610576923076923

Dead in Tombstone is a mix of The Crow and High Plains Drifter, A supernatural revenge western and the perfect vehicle for Trejos talents.  The film begins with Guerrero (Trejo) leading his gang in a daring rescue of fellow member Red Cavanaugh (Anthony Michael Hall) who is about to be hanged.  After his rescue, Cavanaugh reveals a tip he received about a small Colorado mining town that has struck gold but its residents are in a dispute over rights and the gold is locked away in a vault.  The heist could set the gang up and Guerrero agrees to lead the raid

The gang easily overruns the towns sheriff and meager resistance but while Guerrero wants to take the gold and leave, Cavanaugh wants to take over the town.  This leads to Red and the rest of the gang killing Guerrero and renaming the town Tombstone.  Guerrero is buried in the town cemetery but thats where this western takes a turn for the supernatural.  The outlaw is condemned to Hell and confronted by Lucifer himself (Mickey Roarke).  Guerrero makes a deal with the devil to deliver the six souls of the murderous gang members in exchange for his own.  Guerrero literally crawls out of the grave to seek revenge on his former mate in a violent and bloody rampage.

Roarkes satanic portrayal isn't much different than a lot of his recent performances.  Hes kind of laid back and smarmy but his devilish side comes out as he digs his fingers deep into Guerreros chest, licking the blood from his fingers with a malevolent grin.  His part is small but oozes wickedness from every pore.  Its also to see Anthony Michael Hall in a villainous role and he clearly is having a wonderful time being the bad guy.  Dina Meyer is also tossed into the mix as the wife of the Sheriff.  Other than that, however, the rest of the cast is just there as fodder for Trejo to mow down.  And this is the films weakest point.  Trejo doesnt seem to either be tortured enough or enjoying his revenge.

Guerrero is given only twenty-four hours to live again, and he has to kill those six gunmen and offer their souls to Satan so that he can escape damnation.

Here is a revenge story with a nice twist, story that would be perfect for an action-packed western movie, but incredibly, the filmmakers have completely ruined the potential. With the shaky camera that barely shows the action, we don't know what is going on during the poorly shot (and lit) shoot-outs. Production designs are decent, but the film suffers from bad pacing and unmemorable villains.

Danny Trejo does his best, but obviously this is not among his best. Mickey Rourke does what he does, the usual scenery-chewing, and Dina Meyer is wasted in an underwritten role of a sheriffs wife.

And in Brandon Lee's ""The Crow,"" we have a rocker who gets murdered and is brought back to life to avenge his murder by killing the gang of thugs that killed him.  That's basically what we got here with Danny Trejo's ""Dead in Tombstone.""

Danny Trejo is a co-leader of a 7-member gang, who's other leader, his half brother, (Anthony Michael Hall) betrays him and shoots and kills him in cold blood.  Trejo dies and goes to Hell, where the Devil (Mickey Rourke) cuts him a deal to go back to the world of the living to kill the remaining 6 members of the gang within 24 hours, or be forever condemned to Hell.

The setting, of course, is an Old West town by the name of Edenville, CO.  Wait, what?  Yeah...the name of the town was Edenville...originally.  What happens is that after the gang kills Trejo, they take over the town and rename it Tombstone.  But Tombstone was in AZ, right?  (More on that later...)  Well, anyway, this film was very well done in terms of the setting the western costuming.  It was actually film on the border of Transylvania in Romania.  But you'd never know it.  The costuming was dirty and  gritty, with the multi-layered trenchcoat combinations.  Gun shot sounds were very well mixed into the audio track.  And the town itself was a redress actual Romanian town.  3 or so blocks worth where CG paint-outs and background paint-ins, tranformed this town to a very believable Western town.  So as far as a modern contemporary Western goes, it was very well done.

As far as the name Tombstone goes, in a deleted scene that is a film ender shows that the townsfolk removing the town sign and loading it up on a horse wagon that is headed South to AZ....and so there ya go...

As for why not a 5-star rating, I think the deletion of some of the deleted scenes were a mistake that could have added a bit to the story.  But other than that, this film could be considered a new cult classic if it gets the viewership.",1387324800,8,2099,4.454068241469816

At any rate, there is lots of action.  The ""F"" bomb is not the major word in the script but there is plenty of blood to go around.

5201308,4,B0090JBTFM,"Throughout cinema history, the Horror Western is a rare commodity and with the decline of the Western genre these past few decades, it is almost non existent.  It is refreshing to see this slick, stylish return to the genre in Director Roel Reine's 'DEAD IN TOMBSTONE'-2011 highlighting crater faced cult actor Danny Trejo with non stop shoot em up action.  Double crossed by his brother played by slimy Anthony Michael Hall and plugged with enough rounds to sink Afghanistan, Trejo is sent to hell where we have Mickey Rourke giving an eerie performance as Lucifer himself.  Striking a bargain for his soul, Trejo is sent back to the land of the living for only 24 hours to deliver the souls of his brother and five gang members in exchange for his life.  The over 100 minute running time is dedicated to that plot as Director Reine stylishly piles on images of every conceivable genre cliche and it works.  Director Reine known basically for the last two sequels of the 'DEATH RACE' franchise is honing his craft brilliantly and gets great perfs from all including television actress Dina Meyer as a fetching gunslinger who aids Trejo.  The bullets fly, the slow mo cams upset the stomach, and rat a tat editing stuns the cranium as the revenge motif reaches for the climax which may or may not spawn a sequel.  I viewed the unrated Blu-Ray disc which is in stunning 1080P 1.85 widescreen with great DTS MasterAudio to rattle the subwoofer.  The disc has a fistful of extras including featurettes on the making of the film ; a 10 minute stint on the director Roel Reine; deleted scenes and a deleted scene montage and feature commentary to name but a few.  Highly recommended to action enthusiasts and Western fans (the film has hommages to Italian Horror films and Spaghetti Westerns) and a rockin music score by Hybrid, it makes for a great purchase and I can hardly wait for the sequel.  Director Reine is someone to watch in the action genre.",1383523200,6,1948,4.702941176470588
5201309,5,B0090JBTFM,"Originally posted to my blog on September 30, 2013.

Dutch born Roel Rein has already proven himself to be a top-notch action director with movies like ""Death Race 2"" and ""12 Rounds: Reloaded."" Roel started a new era in Dutch Cinema by making mainstream English language Genre Movies with his company Rebel Film and has been very successful at doing them with modest budgets. His latest directorial release is no exception.

""Dead In Tombstone,"" marks Reins third film with actor Danny Trejo (""Machete"", ""Bad Ass"") in this action-packed, supernatural Western that finds Trejo making a deal with the Devil for his soul and mortality after he is murdered by his own gang.

Mickey Rourke appears to relish his role as the roguish Lord of the Underworld, who cant help himself when it comes to keeping an eye on Guerrero, even popping up on occasion to be entertained as Guerrero exacts his bloody retribution. The scenes in hell are especially enjoyable where Rourke saunters around a restrained Trejo, sadistically taunting and torturing Trejos character, even ripping the flesh from his back to feed the fires of hell.

After the ruthless Blackwater Gang overruns the small gold mining town of Tombstone, Colorado (not Arizona) and murders its sheriff, the gang murders their own leader, Guerrero Hernandez (Trejo) in a cold-blooded power grab. As Hernandez lays dying on a saloon floor, he tells his half brother Red Cavanaugh (Anthony Michael Hall) and the rest of his seditious cohorts that he will see them all againin hell.

Sentenced to eternal damnation, Guerrero finds himself confronted by Satan incarnate (Mickey Rourke), who informs him that he has been waiting for him. Not wishing to spend eternity being one of hells pitiful suffers, Guerrero offers the Devil a trade, his soul for the soul of his half brother and the others that betrayed himall delivered within twenty-four hours. One day, twenty-four hours. What is that compared to eternity? Guerrero asks Satan. Amused by the proposition the Devil accepts his offer on one condition: all six souls must die by Guerreros hand and his hand alone. With the deal struck Guerrero is sent back to Tombstone to exact his brutal revenge against his former gang.

Anthony Michael Hall also seems be a natural fit to his role as Guerreros half-brother Red Rojo Cavanugh. Though this is not the first time Hall has played a bad guy (""Warehouse 13""), it is the first time he actually comes off as someone believably despicable and unlikable, and someone who you want to get his comeuppance in the end.

Danny Trejos portrayal of the betrayed gunslinger with a modicum of consciencesomething that Satan points out and tells him will be the undoing of the dealmay not be much of an acting stretch for Trejo, but he certainly knows how to deliver when it comes to portraying the resurrected killer. Trejo plays the bad ass with just enough tough and mean and empathy that the character is likeable and we desire to see him succeed in his quest to save his soul.

Though the screenplay written by Brendan Cowles and Shane Kuhn is pretty standard fair when it comes to the classic plot of a Western revenge film, they do manage to put a twist on the old formula. It also helps that the film was cast not only with three incredible main actors, but also a strong supporting cast that includes Dina Meyer, Richard Dillane, Emil Hostina, Colin Mace, Ovidiu Niculescu, Ronan Summers, Edward Akrout, and Radu Andrea Micu, all of whom help to strengthen the films dialog that at times could have come off as unintelligent if spoken by actors of a lesser caliber.

""Dead In Tombstone"" with its supernatural elements is a gritty vengeance Western that delivers enough shootouts, chase scenes, and explosions to make it an action-packed and entertaining film.",1383350400,,3801,4.90809968847352
5201310,3,B0090JBTFM,"There was a bit of Homage to the old ""Spaghetti Westerns.""  The head bad guy was named ""Red Cavenaugh"" , which was the name of one of the minor bad guys in ""For a Few Dollars More"", one of Clint Eastwood's early movies.

Red was played by Anthony Michael Hall...  Remember when he was a sort of girly looking skinny geek?  He sure has changed from his Sixteen Candles days; A bulked up, grizzly Macho Man now.

Danny Trejo was, of course, Danny Trejo.  He did a much better acting job in Machete, though.

The cinematography wasn't great, but not quite as bad as some previous reviewers warned.  Lots of plot holes, even considering that this was a low budget horror -western- schlock-exploitation flick.  Lots of continuity errors too:  For instance:  Danny had some pretty neat pistols, somewhat reminiscent if the Lefaucheux that often morphed into regular  'six shooters'.

Mickey Roarke made a pretty good 'Lucifer'

A few topless scenes with 'bar girls' that were a lot prettier than your typical ladies for hire were in the real old west.

The gimmick gun danny trejo has, serves absolutely no purpose other than they wanted to put some gimmick weaponry in this film, the story could have been so much better. And why would the devil need some one to kill all the bad guys? they were going to hell anyways. Makes no sense. really disappointed. just rent it instead. Watch Pale rider if u want a revenge film with good story, acting , and dialog. If you just want flash crap watch this then.",1382918400,,619,4.299145299145299
5201335,5,B0090JBTFM,"I have followed Danny Trejo's movies for years and have always enjoyed them.  this movie was outstanding. the story line was fresh.
Danny was his usual nasty self to the bad guys and polite to the Lady..Mickey Rourke was excellent  I liked it a lot.",1382918400,2,249,4.511111111111111

5201337,5,B0090JBTFM,"Danny Trejo, the one who made his movie career with his very recognizable face, is a busy man and he is enjoying his Hollywood moment. With a new ""Machete"" - yes, that guy -- film coming out pretty soon, he is at the top of his game. ""Dead in Tombstone"" is an enjoyable western, with a dose of fun and horror, released just in time for Halloween.

Right at the beginning of the movie, we meet the devil (Mickey Rourke) taking about how evil the west is, saying at one point that ""in the west, I never go hungry."" Then we are taken to the last minutes of Red Cavanaugh (an aged and unrecognizable Anthony Michael Hall), who is about to meet his maker by hanging. However, he is saved at the last minute by his buddies from the Black Water Gang, led by Guerrero de la Paz (Trejo). Once free, and celebrating his escape with the gang, Red tells Guerrero that he has a new plan to make money. He informs Guerrero that there is a dispute over the ownership of a large quantity of gold in the town of Edendale, in Colorado, and that the gold is being stored in the local bank. Red thinks that they should rob the bank and that the job should be easy. Guerrero agrees with him, and off they go. Lucky for them, everything goes smoothly for them, and they secure the gold. Unfortunately, Red had another plan: become the town's new marshal (having killed the current one during the robbery), and rule it with the help of his crime partners. Guerrero is against that (he is a bandit, but has some morals) and is shot to death. Enter the devil (Rourke), who accepts an offer from Guerrero (in hell by now) that he can't refuse.

""Dead in Tombstone"" was filmed in Romania, with beautiful, snowy landscapes, good production design, and directed by Roel Ren. The movie is colorful, yet dark when it needs to be, and successfully mixes western with horror. It has some great lines, like when Red tells Guerrero, ""You don't have to do this, brother. There is plenty of gold to go around,"" to which Guerrero responds, ""I prefer lead."" The film also has plenty suspense, and it will remind you of a Gary Cooper's classic called ""High Noon."" In fact, in one scene, the devil tells Guerrero that it's ""high noon, hombre."" The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital unrated edition includes deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, commentaries, and more.

5201338,5,B0090JBTFM,"Running time approx. 1hr 40min. DTS-HD 5.1, HD Picture widescreen.  An outlaw gang member (Danny Trejo) is betrayed by his own gang, and they kill him, he ends up in (hell), and makes a deal with the devil to spare his soul in exchange for the death and souls of his former gang members.  This movie was well written and beautifully filmed. Stunning cinematography. Stunning props, western sets, period wardrobes, and make-up.  Great special effects and acting. This movie is very impressive, and we all love (Danny Trejo) who plays a very good (gritty) outlaw.  No surprises there, as (Danny Trejo) is well suited for the tough guy roles. I think Mr. Trejo plays western cowboy characters very well, and should continue to bring us more western movies. There are no (dry or boring) areas in this movie; it's full-on action from the start and lots of serious gun fights and blood. There really is nothing bad that I can find in this movie, it was perfectly produced. Love it. This one is a keeper. Buy on Blu-Ray.",1382659200,17,1013,4.674157303370786
5201339,5,B0090JBTFM,This movie is worth every dollar. It has a lot of action. I was very impressed. If you like western movies you will like this one. Not much more to say then I would recommend this to anyone.,1382659200,2,190,4.026315789473684
5201340,2,B0090JBTFM,"I pre-ordered this because I love all the actors in it and liked the story idea. I thought it might be a bit like Machete, an awesome and campy film. Nope. I won't give too much of a spoiler, as you might want it despite reviews, which I'm sure will be low across the board. Mickey Rourke's rendition of Satan, should be sent to Hell. I don't know what happened to him, but he has no facial expression anymore, and his delivery is sooo.... sooo.... monotone. Danny Trejo, well he plays the same character in all his films, so I expected this. I guess, I thought the story would be a little more exciting, and WAY more campy. Unfortunately, it features none of this. I so don't want to rate this low, but I have no choice. If you are bent on watching it, do yourself a favor and just rent. Don't make an ownership commitment too lightly.
Also, the Languages and Subtitle feature on my product didn't work. Apparently not even programmed, even though the folder is there to choose the options. Big, sad, frowny face!",1382486400,,1014,4.427807486631016
