The Arrow interceptor was one of the most advanced aircraft of its kind when cancelled by the Diefenbaker government around 1959.  A similar tragedy across the Atlantic would unfold over the British TSR-2, though the story of the Arrow seems more poignant.  British aviation survived whereas Avro - having prevailed against technical difficulties and political antipathy to produce the world's most cutting edge aircraft - became a shell of what it could have been.  Also, in retrospect, the RAF may have been better off without TSR-2 (which relied on a complex boundary-layer system to remain controllable at low altitude and speed, and may not have been as suitable for the RAF as the Buccaneer, the naval jet the RAF was pressed to take in TSR-2's place; TSR-2 would have been expected to remain in service by the advent of Desert Storm, where Buccaneers and Tornadoes flew with distinction).  In contrast, the Canadians replaced Arrow with American Bomarc missiles and Voodoo interceptors - both obsolete (CF-18 fighters, also American and a generation younger than the Arrow, are the current mainstay of RCAF; excellent strike fighters, they fall short of the Arrow's as interceptors).  Lastly, while TSR-2 showed potential as a great airplane, the Arrow (implicitly in this film anyway) demonstrated its mettle as the jet to beat.  According to legend, both jets lost due to politics (read, Americans).

The film makes two points - Canada unquestionably could have afforded, and did need the Arrow; and that the jet died as the result of a clash of wills between the government of the then popular PM Diefenbaker and Crawford Gordon, Avro's flamboyant boss.  The script conforms to conventional wisdom on both - ""Dief"" was forceful yet indecisive.  Dief's clashes with Gordon seem to have less to do with the merits of the plane than the stubbornness of each side.  Yet, while fishing with Eisenhower (a miscast Michael Moriarty) Dief proves a push-over for Ike's plan of replacing all fighters with unmanned missiles.  As Gordon, Dan Akroyd puts an interesting dramatic spin on the salesman shtick he used on SNL.  If Dief proves willing to staunch any positive word on the Arrow to maintain the fact that he is PM, Gordon manages to be as single-minded in proving the jet the top among others.  To that end, the Avro boss demands the plane be both entirely indigenous and revolutionary - besides the aircraft, it would use new Orenda Iroquois engines.  When the Arrow proves a world-beater even without the Iroquois, the fantastic results are suppressed by Gordon - the government exploit early success as an excuse to cancel the Canadian engine, saddling the plane with underpowered and overweight Pratt & Whitney jets.  Otherwise the government inflates costs, disregards positive numbers and openly wonders whether Canada might be better off if Avro Canada got out of aviation and went into consumer appliances and ""cookware"".  Meanwhile, various teams within Arrow begin to wonder if they should be thinking of themselves rather than the project itself - epitomized by the Orenda design team that thinks its Iroquois jets might be better off optimized for the French Mirage.

The flick relies on singleminded characters, even when history demonstrates more complex motives.  Though an American officer proves dedicated to the Arrow, most of the Americans are cast as heavies - they don't want their plane makers competing with Avro, but they do covet Avro's skilled engineers, many to find themselves working at Lockheed or McDonnell Douglas within a few years of the Arrow's demise.  There's also a conspiracy theory in which the Yanks fear the danger posed by the Arrow to the (then still secret) U-2 spyplane - hard to believe since the Americans were also at work on the SR-71 and spy satellites, and also because the U-2 did prove vulnerable to missiles of the sort championed by Arrow's enemies.  Reps for the big American contractors hover over Avro like flies (or personal injury lawyers) knowing that cancellation will mean fresh and available talent.  Oblivious to foreign interest in the Arrow until he orders it cancelled, Diefenbaker is horrified to learn that the British and US want at least a few of the planes, and that France may want the Orendas for their Mirage III.  Too strong-minded to go back on his decision to cancel Arrow, and knowing he'll be a laughingstock if anybody succeeds on a project he tagged for cancellation, Dief affirms the Arrow's end and then impulsively orders the wholesale destruction of all aircraft, plans, models, tooling, flight records and any other sign that the plane ever existed.  He's PM, and he'll be damned if he has to think twice about anything.  Though the most recognizable face, Akroyd's Gordon is a cipher here - he takes Dief's attack personally, then slides into the alcoholism that will see him die of cirrhosis in poverty in 1967.  Though Gordon wars with the government over Arrow (on hearing of the cancellation, he fires 14,000 Avro workers as a form of economic warfare) and having little respect for Dief's office, Gordon never seeks allies abroad - imagine if Dief saw an order for 200 Orendas from France, and Arrow orders from Scandinavia before ""Black Friday"".  Also, you wonder why some characters have no interaction at all.  Arrow's test-pilot briefs a Canadian official while Avro designers make their case to Christopher Plummer (as the smarmy Transportation Minister George Hees).  Yet there's no after-action scene where the designers tell the pilot that the government wants Avro out of the aviation business, while the pilot tells the designers that the government wants to replace all manned aircraft with missiles.  Still, ""Arrow"" excels as a story of people who worked and lost.  Even though many found a new outlet for their talents, the Arrow remains a heartbreak.  In that sense, the happy ending tagged on, though historically suspect, is welcome.",1093910400,2,6120,5.045680238331678
