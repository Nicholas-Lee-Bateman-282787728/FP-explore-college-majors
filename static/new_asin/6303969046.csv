7857290,5,6303969046,"After 22 years of trying unsuccessfully to sculpt my arms and back this video has finally done the job!  It's great!  I can now wear sleeveless tops with confidence.  I have used Tamilee's videos for years to tone my legs, buns and abs.  Tamilee's in depth training is apparent in all her videos.  These three short 15-minute workouts do exactly what they say they will - give you great arms, back and abs.  I've had success with each and every Tamilee Webb video.",1161129600,,464,4.530120481927711
7857291,5,6303969046,"I loved this workout and I love Tamilee webb. When I work out w/ her videos, it always feels like i've known her forever. She talks like she knows you and makes you feel very comfortable. While doing your workouts she gives you very interesting and valuable information for your health. And its a great workout.",1055808000,,311,4.571428571428571
7857292,5,6303969046,"This may not be the workout for you if you're really conditioned already.  It is NOT a fat burning workout, but a toning one.  There are 3 quick 15 minute sessions, and each one has a warm up & stretch, too.  I've been doing crunches for a long time, and I struggle with keeping my neck in the right position and not hurting myself.  I don't have the Abs of Steel workout, although after doing this, I'm planning to get it.  This is the first time I've ever really enjoyed doing hard, CONCENTRATED stretching & toning.  Partly because it's so short, you know you're not going to be dying forever.  You don't have to feel sweaty and exhausted after a workout-- in fact, a lot of trainers say if you work to exhaustion, you're doing too much.  How are you going to keep that up every day, which is what you ought to do?  You want to feel slightly tired, and ready to go the next day.  This video gives you that-- you're not going to hate yourself tomorrow, but over time, you're going to look great.
I'm already sort of toned from the time I've spent doing weights & other crunches on my own and I could, from the first few minutes, feel a burn in the muscles.  I'm at a plateau, and am trying new things to get the fat to start burning again, and the toning to happen.  This workout is going to do it.
At least on this tape, Tamilee is not one of those over enthusiastic instructors who get annoying after the fiftieth time viewing the v ideo.  She's very low key & straightforward.  The music in this video is background beat-- not much at all, you don't really notice it other than in the warm up.  It's barely there, but you don't really miss it.
The final section on abs has a few yoga moves as stretches-- sneaking a bit of cat pose and cobra pose in there.  Shows how pervasive yoga really is, even when we don't know we're doing it.",1042502400,3,1838,4.238505747126437
7857293,4,6303969046,"The three sections are arms/shoulders, chest/back, and abs. I would have preferred a workout that just focused on the arms and back and skipped the abas section. (I already do abs of steel every day) The segments are great (I have only done them once), they went by so quickly, I was sad when the 15 minutes were up! These are my initial thoughts, I might change it to 5 stars after I get over the 3rd segment focusing on the abs.",1003968000,5,430,4.2560975609756095
7857294,5,6303969046,"I bought this video about 4 years ago and keep going back to it.  It's the first upper body sculpting program that ever added definition to my arms and back.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  The exercises are ""basics with a twist.""  Let me just say that you will see more definition in your triceps by doing her floor move than from working out with a machine in the gym.  The back exercises are particularly effective and really help you to maintain good posture.
One caveat is that once you get used to the ab workout, you'll need to move up to something harder.  It's definitely for beginners.  But when you plateau with the other workouts, just add more weight, and it'll still be challenging.  I used to do one 15 minute workout a day, and that really works.  YOU WILL BE SORE WHEN YOU'RE DONE THOUGH!",995500800,6,803,4.408163265306122
