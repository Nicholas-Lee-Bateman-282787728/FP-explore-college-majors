3910058,2,B002DDIQX0,"WESTBOUND(1959)---(directed by Budd Boetticher)---Randolph Scott, Virginia Mayo, Karen Steele, Andrew Duggan, Michael Dante, Michael Pate.
One of the seven westerns director Boetticher made with Scott(""7 Men From Now""; ""The Tall T""; ""Ride Lonesome""; ""Buchanan Rides Alone""; ""Decision At Sundown""; and ""Comanche Station""). Although all seven are high grade, ""B"" westerns, this one is, IMO, the weakest of the bunch. Scott plays a Union officer ordered to return to his civilian job of running a stagecoach line that will be carrying regular shipments of California gold that is desperately needed to conduct the war against the Confederacy. The stage line is based in a town run by a man(Duggan) who is sympathetic to the South and is determined to stop the gold from getting into Union hands and divert it to the Confederate war effort. Mayo plays Duggan's wife, who once had ""a thing going on"" with Scott. Steele plays the widow of a disabled Union soldier who was murdered by a member of Duggan's gang. She agrees to help Scott run the stage line. Given the poor quality of her acting ability, her only apparent reason for being in the film is her ample bosom and to provide a ""wholesome"" love interest for Scott, who no longer has any feeling for Mayo. This is an ""okay"" film, but suffers when compared to the other ""Boetticher/Scott"" films in the cycle(IMO, the best of the lot is, ""7 Men From Now"", which features Lee Marvin in an early role as a terrific ""bad guy"").",1258243200,11,1472,4.845238095238095

3910063,3,B002DDIQX0,"Budd Boetticher distanced himself from this movie since it was done under contract. As a result, the story, relationships, and characterizations are weaker than his other collaborations with Randolph Scott.

Scott makes the film watchable with his competence, likability, and compassion; I'd recommend it only for fans wishing to complete the Ranown Cycle.

Seven Men From Now (1956) is the best of the cycle, imo.
The Tall T (1957) and Ride Lonesome (1959) are highly recommended.",1436313600,,481,5.315789473684211

3910074,4,B002DDIQX0,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""WESTBOUND"" (1959) (72 min/Color) -- Starring Randolph Scott, Virginia Mayo, Karen Steele, Michael Dante, Andrew Duggan & Michael Pate

Directed by Budd Boetticher

Capt. John Hayes (Scott) left the Civil War behind him when he took on the job of managing the Overland Stage Lines out of a small Colorado town. Clay Putnam (Andrew Duggan) has not forgotten that the Confederacy lost and he plans on robbing Hayes' Overland Stage of one of its gold shipments from California to the North. He wants the gold to stay in the South to revive the Confederate cause. Meanwhile, his wife Norma (Virginia Mayo) complicates matters since she was Hayes' old flame, and Putnam's cronies want the gold for themselves.

Great story within a story of the one armed Federal veteran running a relay station. The color and cinematography was good too. HOWEVER, what really caught my attention, and still does, is the musical score! The music, especially the theme for traveling stagecoaches, is perfect, and very melodic!  Hats off to composer David Buttolph for his orchestration through the west.

Great cast with Michael Pate, Andrew Duggan, Karen Steele and Michael Dante.

A fast-paced western with a number of twists, its is an fine example of the Scott / Boetticher pairing.

3910075,4,B002DDIQX0,"In 1864, Union cavalry Captain John Hayes (Randolph Scott) is commissioned to head up a new daily overland stage operation between California and Julesburg, Colorado, to bring both mail and gold east for the Union (yet for some reason the film is titled ""Westbound""; I guess ""Eastbound"" wouldn't be a compelling title for a western). Hayes is very familiar with Julesburg, the place he lost his sweetheart Norma (Virginia Mayo) to hotel owner and local big man Clay Putnam (John Duggan). On arriving in town, he finds it to be full of Confederate sympathizers, chief among them Putnam and his gunslinging right-hand man Mace (Michael Pate), and he finds few sympathetic to his own cause besides one-armed soldier Rod Miller (Michael Dante) and his wife Jeanie (Karen Steele), and a few broken-down old drivers and sodbusters. Soon things turn violent, but will the town of Julesburg turn a blind eye because of it's southern sympathies, or will it end up supporting the honorable Hayes and his attempts to just run a stage line?

The fourth of the seven collaborations between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott, WESTBOUND is generally considered the weakest, and was dismissed by the director himself as something that should have gone riding into the ocean. It's not that bad at all, though I suppose I'd agree with the conventional wisdom. The major problem is that the basic screenplay and story (by Berne Giler and Albert S. LeVino) just aren't that compelling; we've seen loads of town overlords who employ amoral gunslingers to do their dirty work, and neither Clay Putnam nor his wife are particularly well-developed. And the film rushes by in a way that belies the obviously fairly expensive (at least for Boetticher) production - it's glossy and beautifully photographed in very bright Technicolor (by J. Peverell Marley), and yet it feels undeveloped and far too short at 72 minutes to really explore some of the interesting underlying themes very much at all. One thing I liked is that there's a subtle contrast between the one-armed ""half a man"" Rod, and the weak and amoral Clay, and their marriages to strong women - but that doesn't really go anywhere, and Mayo in particular is underused.

But as I say, the color is great - though I must mention that it's a bit TOO glossy overall, and this is one of those westerns where the women all look like they've come out of 50s glamour shoots - and Boetticher's shot selection and direction of actors is excellent all around. There are some memorable moments, like a 30-second street-level shot of several men moving towards a fallen and dying man, a stagecoach robbery that goes all wrong, and a stampede in the rain, and Boetticher manages to get a few of his typically terse and funny bits of dialogue in as well. And Scott is really quite good, dominating the action in a way he didn't always need to do - it's as if here he knows the material isn't that good, and so he steps it up a little bit. It's interesting to see him play a Union officer; I've seen him play Confederates several times, but I'm not sure I've seen him wearing the blue. The music by David Buttolph sounds like it could be from any western, it's just so...""generic""...but it's fine, if a little too lively for the dark turn the story ends up taking. And the ending of the film, with Scott in a rather ambivalent place as regards both of the main female characters, is kind of neat.

This is a no-frills Warner Archive disc and as such the ""chapters"" are just breaks at each 10-minute mark, and there are no extras at all; but it plays fine, and the print is in good shape, and it's correctly presented at 1.85:1.  Certainly nobody should be rushing to get this before they've got the first Boetticher/Scott collaboration,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Men-From-Now/dp/B000BDH6DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Men From Now</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Films-of-Budd-Boetticher/dp/B001ER4CNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Films of Budd Boetticher</a>&nbsp;box set containing the other five.

3910076,5,B002DDIQX0,"I remember seeing this movie at The Drake theater on Woodhaven Blvd. (which is an Italian Restaurant now!) in Queens, NY in '60 or '61 at a Saturday afternoon kiddie Matinee with some friends who are long gone now. I was 7 or 8 at the time and the movie stood out when I saw it. It was superior to the usual dreck that they played (Sinbad and Cheesie Horror Movies) This was a Western and a Randolph Scott Western to boot. Years later when I got more ""sophisticated"" i.e. college student I realised it was a Bud Boetticher Western! I knew I was on to something. By the way Karen Steele who plays the eventual widow in the movie was married to Boetticher at the time. Hope this little essay helps.",1289260800,9,696,4.28030303030303

The only minus is the somewhat predictable story. Burt Kennedy did not write this one. I recommend this film highly. The dvd quality is also great.",1262304000,6,461,4.372093023255814
