8300904,5,B001F3JAZW,"In this easy to follow videocassette you can learn some of the BEST stretches out there to increase range of motion, prevent injuries, and improve performance. Whether you are competing at an athletic equine event, or just out for a trail ride, the one thing that you are asking your horse to do is move. If your horse is stiff or in pain it cannot move well.

Horse Stretching will loosen up the muscles and enably your horse to trave with balance, strength and flexibility. Horse trainer, world champion mounted shooter, and national judo champion, Frank Lloyd learned to stretch his own muscles to prevent injury and increase his range of motion. He has now developed and is applying similar techniques to train horses and teach people at The Horse Stretch Ranch.

I can recommend this product because as a horse-owner I know that stretch works and has been beneficial to my horse.",1265241600,,884,4.771241830065359
