5322332,5,B009EH7MR4,"I got a chance to see this documentary at a film fest, and it was eye opening.  As a straight guy living in the midwest, I had no idea about the scale of the issues captured in this documentary.

This is the story about equality told through the eyes of the people that Prop 8 affected.  Through series of interviews and footage of protests across California, the filmakers captured the frustration, hurt and anger that Prop 8 levied on the gay community.  It also captured the feeling of hope as well.  Hope that through protests, information and outreach that they can work to overturn the effects of the law.  It worked too, and the movement is spreading.

As a supporter of equality rights, this spoke to me.  Its films like this that are helping the movement of gay rights in the U.S.  As one of the producers was quoted as saying 'You've never heard of a civil rights movement that failed.  It just takes time.""",1352937600,5,917,4.503030303030303
5322333,5,B009EH7MR4,"I am a straight man living in Long Beach, CA. I watched with baited breath in 2008 as the results of the presidential election and the state propositions came funneling into my live internet stream. There were a few things I cared about, most not revelvant to this review.

When Prop 8 was approved by the voting masses, the celebration of a promising new presidency in our country; the unbridled joy was circumvented by something that I thought was a shoe in for our great state of CA. Hours later, there were hundreds if not thousands of people marching down my street; signs in hand, megaphones, children on shoulders, ordinary effing people, man. This wasn't some focus group of semi-well organized 'doers'. These were real people: partisan, non-partisan, straight, gay, lesbian, trans-gender, drunks who got swept up in the moment--these were people that understood their family, friends and neighbors had just been denied a very basic civil right.

Remove all of the supernatural from the Christian bible our country holds so dear. All of the misinterpreted hate. And we have something. We have equality. The current lack of equality will be looked at with scorn and quiet disbelief by our grand-children--just as as the struggle women and races other than old caucasian men have faced for centuries.

I was fortunate to see ""Inspired: The Voices Against Prop 8"" in a theater. With friends. And strangers. The quality of the 'found footage' editing craftsmanship, motion-graphics and narrative were superb. Film festival level. And beyond. This isn't  JUST a labor of love. It's a labor of what love should be. There is a last frontier of civil rights that is slowly being conquered. And I have no doubt that that it will be. I look forward to that day.

I commend everyone involved in this the little BIG production. You made something out of what too many perceive as nothing.",1352937600,2,1884,4.911949685534591
5322334,5,B009EH7MR4,"A short time ago I had the privilege to see this compelling film in the theater.  It takes you along on the emotional journeys of many people who were deeply moved by the stunning outcome of California's Proposition 8.  As you watch, you will see how the result had such an important and profound impact on the lives of these people. As of this writing, there is still no resolution for them  and countless others throughout the state. This film is about understanding the amazing value of something that many people take for granted.",1352937600,2,534,4.659574468085107
5322335,5,B009EH7MR4,"Inspired: The Voices Against Prop 8 is the window to the front lines of the protests
by those who were dismayed, heartbroken and angered as the result of a California
ballot initiative to revoke the right to marry for same sex couples in November of 2008.
Powerful, poignant, even funny at times, it made me wonder:  Where was I?  And why
wasn't I there when it was all going down? This film was a wake up call for a guy that
didn't pay much attention to politics while politics were paying attention to him and
stripping him of his civil rights. Inspired is a lesson in Civics that teaches from
the experiences of the people who were there, the importance one person's voice has when
it joins a chorus of like minded folks who's goal it is to insure that the LGBT
community NOT be relegated to second-class citizenship. While the case is still
pending in the CA Supreme Court,(as of the date of this post) I think that anyone
who isn't afraid to hear the positions from the population who Proposition 8
actually AFFECTS, that this film could change hearts one viewer at a time.",1352937600,,1078,4.494897959183674
5322336,5,B009EH7MR4,I was a part of this project and was very pleased with the sensitivity and outcome of this work.  Charlie has done an amazing job and I sincerely recommend it to you.,1352937600,,166,4.1875
5322337,5,B009EH7MR4,"Inspired:  The Voices Against Prop 8 is an honest and compelling documentary chronicling the aftermath of the November, 2008 election in California which revoked the rights of LGBT citizens to be afforded the same opportunities as their heterosexual compatriots to marry the person they love.
This documentary follows several groups of LGBT people who were adversely affected by Proposition 8 and allows them to tell their stories in their own words.  We are taken on their journey as they march for Equality and Justice.  The film gives a concise but extensive look at how so many people were mobilized to create a movement even given their differences.  Blacks, Hispanics, Whites all banded together for a common cause.
Today, nothing is yet settled in the cases pending before the courts but the film shows the promise that the future may hold satisfaction for the LGBT citizens of California.  I have seen the film several times and I highly recommend it.",1352937600,,959,5.0062893081761
5322338,5,B009EH7MR4,"This is a must view dvd if you are one of us who really cares about LGBTQ Civil rights. This documentary highlights the passion and storm that grew from Prop 8 and the brave men and women who stood strong and said ""NO! You will not take my right to commit to the partner that I love."" As a lesbian, a woman, and someone capable of committing to a loving relationship. I take my hat off to the film and its participants.",1352937600,,419,4.121951219512195
5322339,5,B009EH7MR4,"This is such a great documentary about such a huge part of the LGBT equality movement.  This will probably be played to our next generation of children, you know, assuming they allow LGBT history in the class room.  It's very moving and definitely got me Inspired.",1352937600,,264,4.717391304347826
5322340,5,B009EH7MR4,it's rare that i would be so literal about something so awesome but 'inspired' is inspirational - corny but true! this doc is a phenomenal look at those fighting the good fight against prop. 8 - i was lucky to see this on the big screen and will definitely be adding it to my personal library.,1352937600,,293,4.25
5322341,5,B009EH7MR4,The religious right are leaving a legacy of H8 and this film captures a moment in time. California will get full equal rights. Fantastic worth watching .,1352937600,,153,4.703703703703703
5322342,5,B009EH7MR4,"I saw this movie at a few film festivals and it was really great.  Having lived through the Prop 8 campaign in Long Beach and Los Angeles, I thought the film did a great job of capturing the emotion and anger after Prop 8 passed.  I was impressed with the film's ability to capture diverse voices and opinions.

The documentary is raw, engaging, and at times funny.  It's easy to watch, and a must see for anyone interested in the gay rights movement.",1352937600,4,451,4.397590361445783
5322343,5,B009EH7MR4,"Inspired: The Voices Against Prop 8 is a must see.  It is an amazing tool in political/marriage amendment work, but, more importantly, it is also a powerful reminder that the GLBTQ community is NOT just gay, white and male.
It really helped me to start thinking 'outside the box!'",1352937600,4,280,4.714285714285714
5322344,5,B009EH7MR4,"I've had the privilege of viewing INSPIRED two times. Each time I learned a little more.  As a straight senior female, I really did not know much about the LGBT community.  INSPIRED has helped me to understand a little more.  I never gave much thought as to how this community lives and what they are fighting for. My eyes and mind were opened. I now realize that we all pretty much are looking for the same thing - freedom to live our lives as we choose and equal rights for all.  This film depicts how several communities came together in a peaceful manner for a common good. It shows how each group reaches out to others to determine the best way to present their views to the lawmakers.

I pray that the future brings full equality for all. The recent election brought a few more states forward. Hopefully, others will follow.",1352937600,3,830,4.470198675496689
8540604,5,B009EH7MR4,"I still remember the shock and bewilderment that totally enveloped me on November 4th, 2008. Watching the election results come in from my living room in the trendy Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles, I was astonished that such a discriminatory constitutional amendment such as Prop 8 could even remotely pass in such a ""liberal"" state as California. My shock turned to disappointment, my disappointment turned to anger, and my anger turned into action as I immediately found myself thrust into activism for equality/civil rights for the LGBTQ community. Thanks to director Charlie Gage, I found those raw emotions resurfacing in this remarkable documentary film that showcases the awakening of a ""sleeping giant"" in California... the LGBTQ movement. Showcasing various interviews and raw footage from throughout San Diego to San Francisco, Charlie Gage places the viewer directly in the middle of the Prop 8 drama and aftermath , whereas the viewer experiences the reaction and launch of various LGBTQ organizations throughout the Golden State as Gays and Lesbians found their civil right of marriage equality ripped from them at the hands of California voters. This documentary is most-definitely a MUST SEE!",1354492800,,1208,5.329842931937173
8540605,5,B009EH7MR4,Raw emotional informative; a documentary everyone should watch. My Mum would be very proud of you and your movie Charlie.,1354060800,,121,5.1
8540606,4,B009EH7MR4,"Inspired: The Voices Against Prop 8 is the capturing of a powerful GLBTQ-human rights call to action for marriage equality.  A genuine multi-layered community inspired and involved movement that has profoundly affected a country and the world.  Gritty and authentic!

8540607,5,B009EH7MR4,"Many documentaries on political issues tell their stories in broad chronological arcs, and dive in for close-ups on some of the people and events that define the arcs. INSPIRED succeeds by taking an opposite path: telling the story of one moment in time, the protests that immediately followed the passage of Proposition 8. The immediacy of the street-level story -- literally -- is enhanced by pocket-camera video, creating the feeling of being there surrounded by the fire and emotion of the moment.",1353283200,,501,5.121951219512195
8540608,5,B009EH7MR4,"The night of the Long Beach march, I was having a few drinks at The Reno Room, located on the corner of Redondo & Broadway. Coincidentally, this intersection became the end point for the march. The patrons all emptied out of the bar to witness the chaos: police in riot gear, boisterous protesters jutting handmade signs in the air, a myriad of news vans and reporters. As the police assembled themselves to diffuse the protesters blocking the intersection, I had a feeling that I was witnessing the beginnings of an organized groundswell.

This documentary has the kind of impact and inspiration, that could eventually lead to the overturn of ALL bans on gay marriage nationwide.

8540609,5,B009EH7MR4,"I was lucky to see this film in Chicago this summer, and it was moving, empowering, and honest.  The film rips off the blinders of social injustice to reveal a story of human rights and civic duty.  It accurately captures the birth of a period of activism that culminates today in the legal gay marriage rights of Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, Washington D.C., New York, Washington, Maryland, and Maine.  But getting there wasn't easy; it was laborious and sometimes messy.  The film does great justice in showing that the fight isn't over, but that there is reason to be optimistic.  Marvelous!",1353110400,,595,4.851485148514851
8540610,5,B009EH7MR4,"For a lot of people, the election in 2008 was bittersweet; we'd made a historic leap forward in electing our first African-American President, and had signaled we wanted to make a departure from the last 8 years of the Republican agenda, but we had also seen a huge setback in equal rights after Proposition 8 passed in California. It was made even more painful when we looked at what happened and realized that we had gotten complacent and figured that other people would fight our fights for us. We hadn't done nearly enough to stand up to those who would deny lesbian and gay citizens equal protection under the law. INSPIRED paints a vivid portrait of that realization and the rebirth of a grassroots gay rights movement across California and the entire country. Four years later as this current wave of progress has resulted in huge victories for marriage equality in other states, it's even more important to look back and see how we marshaled our strength and came back fighting.",1353024000,,986,4.771929824561403
8540611,5,B009EH7MR4,"I had the honor of programming this film for the film festival, the Global Peace Film Festival, held in Orlando.  The festival audiences thoroughly enjoyed the film and the chance to meet the director. I programmed the film because it succeeds beautifully not only in capturing the voices, emotions and arguments of the people mobilizing to right the civil rights injustice of Prop 8, but also in giving a wonderful primer on what it takes to organize individuals effectively as a group to achieve a civic or political goal.  I recommend this film both to people interested in the civil rights issues surrounding marriage equality as well as those interested in getting a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a peaceful, purposeful civic action.",1353024000,2,737,5.082644628099174
8540612,5,B009EH7MR4,"While watching this documentary, I was amazed at how well it captured what happened before, during and after Prop 8 passed. It is definitely a film to watch if you were or were not part of these historical times. It is filled with a mixture of joy, sadness, laughter but most of all with hope.

Inspired will leave you with a recognition that there's still a lot of work to be done. It will reignite your desire to get involved and have your voice heard in the name of freedom, respect, love and equality.",1352937600,,505,4.372340425531915
8540613,5,B009EH7MR4,"Growing up I remember being in school, every January, our teachers would show us the movies on the Civil Rights movement and there I found heroes to believe in. I know someday, this film will do the same.  Be shown in schools and INSPIRE new organizers.
