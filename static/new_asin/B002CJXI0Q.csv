3906146,2,B002CJXI0Q,"I've only seen this great performance available on VHS back in the '80's, so I jumped at the chance to buy it here on DVD. This dvd will not work in every player. When it arrived I popped it in my Denon dvd player and it could not read the formatting, so I put it into a cheaper player in the spare bedroom and it played.
  What I saw and heard was disturbing to say the least.  The picture and sound quality was horrible. In addition to this, every song begins with about 10 seconds of video that is not in sync with the soundtrack.  The sellers/copiers also took the liberty of adding cheap visual effects that were not in the original VHS performance.
  If you are a die hard fan of Aerosmith and you must own this on dvd no matter what, go ahead and buy it.  If you are looking for a clear picture and sound to accompany this hard to find concert, don't waste your money.",1286928000,19,875,4.1420118343195265
3906147,1,B002CJXI0Q,"Was excited to see Amazon had links to outside vendors, since I wanted to own this DVD for sometime. Purchased the DVD, received it in the mail. Had a groud of Aerosmith fans over for the initial viewing and found out it was not compatable with North American DVD players... Lesson the hard way, be careful what you purchase and always prescreen before a party",1154044800,2,360,4.553846153846154
3906148,4,B002CJXI0Q,"First of all, I'm not going to focus on DVD/VHS versions/editions blablablabla. I don't care about it. I was lucky enough to finally and completely download this thing from the internet yesterday. I desired to see this show for a long time, and though it wasn't exactly what I expected from '70 Aerosmith Rock Concert, it satisfied me for the most part. It has a few flaws, but still it is a great experience!

It was originally recorded in Cotton Bowl, Dallas, Texxas, on July 4, 1978. So in the time when Aerosmith was in their heyday. Although tensions in the band were high at the time (hard using on drugs, Tyler-Perry conflict that finally led to the band break-up), the Boston Bad Boys were still able to give an excellent performance and here They prove it! Aerosmith is playing with passion, energy and attitude, They totally kicked off the audience. Steven Tyler is great frontman, and he sings emotionally and energetically, and it's so cool when He says ""What? I can't hear Ya!"" to the public, it made me laugh! Joe Perry delivers excellent riffing and solos, and though He slips on a few moments, the guy clearly shows He's master of the guitar. Joey Kramer slams his drums with rawness and passion, Tom Hamilton walks around with his bass and happy face hidden behind blond shag, and Brad Whitford, though remains in shadow, is a great rhytm guitarist and gives the sound its complete measurement. On each song the band sounds fresh, powerful, raw, and young. After all, I don't like one thing: why the hell the closing jamming parts of Milk Cow Blues and Rats In The Cellar and 1st chorus and 2nd verse of Toys In the Attic thrown out? I can't understand that. Ted Nugent does a good job on Milk Cow Blues, but don't tell Me he blows Aerosmith out of water - when Joe Perry starts his solo part, HE blows Ted away doing great bluesy solo in significant Aerosmith style! Well, what else can I say. The band lacks energy on a few moments, but it's still a great show, even if there are a few lowlights.

Highly recommended to any rock fan, must have for any fan of the band! Essential Rock N' Roll from old Aerosmith. Great stuff!",1134777600,2,2143,4.520618556701031
3906149,4,B002CJXI0Q,"Wow.  This brings it all back.  I was not at the Texxas Jam, but I saw Aerosmith on the ""Draw the Line"" tour.  Compared to when I saw them, they are actually more sober on this video, but this is definitely the Toxic Twins in their heyday.  (Joe Perry fell off the drum kit face first in Indianapolis on the same tour).  They look so young, but anyone who saw them in this era was young and is old now.  :((  I recommend this DVD for any Aerosmith fan from the 1970s.

While I highly recommend this item, it is not perfect.  It only captures half of the set list.  (""Dream On"" and  ""Mama Kin/SOS"" two critical omissions).  The songs have been edited to make the video fit a certain time goal, perhaps a late night TV special.  The ending jams of ""Rats in the Cellar"" and ""Milk Cow Blues"" are shortened, and other edits are noticeable - it is incredible how you can remember fine details when presented with actual sound and footage.  The edits are tolerable, in order to have access to such footage - except there is a HUGE disappointment with ""Toys in the Attic"",  one half of the kick butt closer is edited out, including two choruses with the signature riff.

In response to some items that appeared in the VHS reviews.  The right side sound is lower in the mix, some VHS copies may or may not have lost it totally.  The full mix is here, but the ""right side"" and Joe Perry is definitely lower in the mix, so you have to correct with some type of manual adjustment which should not be difficult.  Ted Nugent is present for ""Milk Cow Blues"", and I disagree with reviews that say he blows away a wasted Aerosmith, Ted simply plays his style of guitar, while Aerosmith stays with their working man garage band style of playing.

If you were an Aerosmith fan in the 1970s, and want to feel again how it was back then, I would recommend this DVD.",1134345600,4,1844,4.305232558139535

8364088,4,B002CJXI0Q,"This is Aerosmith during their Draw the Line tour. You get to see them perform the classic stuff from the early days before they started going commercial. The only down sides to this DVD are 1) It's never been remastered so it more or less the quality of a vhs tape and 2) the person who filmed this wasn't content with just filming the concert, he decided he wanted to try and be ""artsy"" in certain parts of the film and show the fans. All in all it's still worth getting.",1364169600,,473,4.208791208791209
