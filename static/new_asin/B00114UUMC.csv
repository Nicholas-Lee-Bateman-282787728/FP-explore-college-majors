3060253,3,B00114UUMC,"This is the Extended episode to Gundam Seed Destiny, for those not in the know.  But while it wraps up everything and extends the already awesome fight scenes.  The reason this gets low marks in my books is the price.

Seriously 47mins for 22$..you can get 2h30m long blu rays on sale for that..even anime blue rays on sale or normal for that.

I highly recommend this to any fan of the series..but shop around for a better rate",1298937600,4,428,4.379746835443038
3060254,4,B00114UUMC,"Ok, I know this probably sounds harsh, but I really did not care for Gundam Seed Destiny. As a major fan of the Gundam franchise (Wing & Seed are my all time favorites, w/ Wing being the reason I got hooked on anime) I really did try my best to like it, I tried REALLY hard.  It started out incredible, the first few episodes were very promising & made one think that quite possibly Seed Destiny may just in fact match (maybe even exceed) the original Seed. Then suddenly it turned to a big ol steaming pile 'o crap. Somehow the ""hero"" ended up not being much of a hero & a certain character that you KNOW for a fact died in Seed is no longer dead, & blah, blah, BLECH. Basically, if you actually finished watching Seed Destiny, (& let's face it, you probably did with the hopes that MAYBE it will get better) you were left scratching your head thinking: WTF?! How could they have gone SO wrong?! Lo & behold theres Final Plus to save the day (or atleast Seed Destiny). Final Plus is everything the last couple of episodes of Destiny SHOULD have been & its saving grace. It clears up alot of the little things that left you saying WHAT?! & the action lives up to what you expect of a Gundam series. If you watched Seed Destiny, I highly recommend watching Final Plus. Buy it, borrow it, rent it- WHATEVER- just watch it. For those of you who found Destiny to be lacking &/or a major disappointment (like I did), it will make it better. Not all better, but better. For those who watched Destiny & enjoyed it- its more of a good thing. Final Plus is really very well done, it's just too bad the rest of the series was not of the same caliber.",1272931200,3,1640,4.256410256410256
3060255,4,B00114UUMC,This was a pretty decent ending to less than stellar sequel series to Seed. There were some nice conclusions to the many story arcs in this series. As an alternative to the series' finale this movie was slightly better although there were some changes made that didn't really add any meaning(***SPOILER*** such as Athrun also being there in Messiah when Durandal is shot) Also excluded is the added scenes of Kira in the Zaft uniform which I think should have bee included in Final Plus but I guess can only be seen in Movie IV. Other than that this was a decent purchase.,1244419200,2,572,4.563106796116505
3060256,5,B00114UUMC,"If you've got volumes #1-#12, you already know you need this.  There is a brief refresher, then it jumps right into the action and finally closes things off ... until the next incarnation!  It gets 5 stars just because I kept looking and looking for a volume #13 - it couldn't possible end with #12 - and FINALLY found this and gave it a shot.  It hit the spot and gave proper closure to the series.  Enjoy.",1232236800,8,407,4.246753246753247

3060258,5,B00114UUMC,"This movie is everything the last episode of Gundam Seed Destiny should have been. All the great action, drama, and characters come colliding in one huge climactic battle. And different from the final episode, as the action comes to a close it reveals the future for the Gundam Pilots, Zaft, Orb, and the Earth. If you are a Gundam Seed fan, and felt the final episode of Seed Destiny left without closure, then this is a must have for your collection.",1220572800,18,452,4.592592592592593

8240472,4,B00114UUMC,"Anime fans who have watched Gundam Seed Destiny will all remember, it started off as a pretty solid sequel to the likeable Gundam Seed tv series, with a whole new cast of characters, new lead hero and the story flipped on its head as we focus on ZAFT characters as the central cast now.

Great premise.

Then the series around its midpoint starts to go wrong as the writers have a sudden bout of identity crisis, lose their direction with the story, take all the main characters and shove them in the background, bring back the heroes from the first series and have them hijack the story, and then worst of all, take the main character Shinn and reduce him to some low-rent loser villain.  Utterly sad.  And anyone who remembers the final ep of the TV series?  What the hell half-assed ending was that as Jesus Yamato & Co score a flawless victory on the enemies and Shinn Asuka is left looking like a complete chump with no real conclusion, just the credits rolling.

GSD Final Plus is a reworking of the final 2 eps of that series that undoes a lot, but not all the damage caused by the lousy writing of the final chapters of the GSD tv series and for that it scores extra stars, including the fact that the show creators acknowledged how bad the final eps of Seed were, and redid it to be much more watchable.  Now if the rest of GSD got that much attention, it could have actually been a good series.

If you've watched GSD and thought the ending was really wonky, then definitely watch this final OVA, and if you've never watched GSD, don't bother because this story will make no sense.  Plus not watching destiny is a big plus anyways and skip straight to Gundam 00",1305590400,2,1671,4.39935064935065
