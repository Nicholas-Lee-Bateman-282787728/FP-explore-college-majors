8563793,2,B00B81NQRY,"Lynyrd Skynyrd is one of my all-time favorite bands and that would include this recording/video. From the title ""documentary"" I expected something beyond the great music. My expecation was not met due to the misleading title of this DVD, as also noted by other reviewers. If you are a hard-core LS fan, I recommend this DVD. If you are looking for anything beyond 8 songs/videos, I cannot recommend this DVD for the reasons stated.",1375920000,4,431,4.837837837837838
8563794,4,B00B81NQRY,"This DVD has black and white footage of the original Lynyrd Skynyrd Band. Seven of the songs are from Winterland 1975 featuring Gary Rossington,Ed King, Ronnie VanZant, Leon Wilkerson,Allen Collins and Artimus Pyle. NO Billy Powell but a unknown harmonica player. The 8th song T for Texas is from Winterland 1976 featuring Ronnie,Billy, Leon, Allen,Artimus and Gary and also from the Outlaws Hughie Thomasson and Billy Jones. Not the complete shows but pretty cool. The quality is not perfect but well worth it. A lot of use hardcore fans have these shows in our collection but this DVD is a cool collection for someone who wants to experience the original band who may not have these shows. I don't know why the band does not go on and release this stuff.",1370044800,6,756,4.778625954198473

8563797,3,B00B81NQRY,"This movie contains black and white footage of performances by Lynrd Skynyrd.  Its a very bare bones presentation, but it is still enjoyable.  My main complaint is that I was excepting more of a documentary and there is no information to be gained from this film at all. Its just the songs.  There isn't even a title screen and credits so I don't know where any of this footage even came from or where it was shot at.  I was going to give it two stars review but that seemed a little to harsh.  The DVD is just poorly designed.

Here are the songs listed on the back of the DVD.
Call me the breeze.
Gimme three steps.
Whiskey Rock-a-roller.
I'm a country boy.
I ain't the one.
T for Texas.
Needle and the spoon.
Sweet home Alabama.",1365465600,11,731,4.260869565217392
