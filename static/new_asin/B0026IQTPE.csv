All the different Police Units give a very nice and good inside view. (Dicovery review)",1261526400,,283,4.163636363636364
8352720,5,B0026IQTPE,"If you work in law enforcement like I do you will find this show extremely interesting. It shows how policemen train and operate to fight the criminal. I am amazed at the skill of this legendary SAS hero (British Special Forces) and continue to watch in amazement. It also shows all the different automatic weapons that ELITE POLICE are using around the world. Each episode is divided in two: a first part in which Ryan closely observes the training of the unit he's a guest of and a second part in which he follows an actual operation in the field. There's plenty of reportages about world's criminals and crime-fighters out there, but none of them follows elite police officers both in training and in operation. If you are into guns and are in the military or law enforcement you will simply love this!",1245888000,2,805,4.636363636363637
