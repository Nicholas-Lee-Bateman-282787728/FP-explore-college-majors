I don't understand why NOT, I'm sure there are more people who would buy it on DVD! It's NOT even available on Firestick, how about that, it SUCKS! I did find it on youtube, but the video isn't the best and 99.9 % of the time the audio kicks off and you can't hear CRAP!",1505260800,,411,3.847058823529412
7822573,5,6302174872,"I have this movie on VHS; however, I'm very shocked to find it not available on DVD. When will the publishers release this film?  It's a beautiful love story. The photography is wonderful and beautifully haunting. I saw this back in 1988 and I desperately want to see it again since I have no VHS player anymore.  Hate to dispose of the movie until I can buy it on DVD. PLEASE RELEASE THIS MOVIE TO THE PUBLIC!!!!!!",1427241600,3,415,4.376623376623376

I found this VHS copy some time ago, but did not have a VCR. My mom has a VCR, so I finally decided to purchase it!! Watching this movie brought back some wonderful memories. Thanks so much!",1381104000,2,334,4.075757575757576
