8383150,5,B002WI8TMY,"""I love this collection, an invaluable history lesson presented in Portuguese with English subtitles. Its actually somewhat overwhelming to see such beauty and absorb so much history. Its best to be savored a little at a time, even replaying small segments several times to really take it in. If there is one small detractor, the narration is rather static. All considered, very worth the price. ""
 I agree with the customer.. I also own this collection and it comes in very handy for my non-portuguese speaking wife and children.
