7813219,4,6301641817,"Lynda Carter of Wonder Woman fame stars in this 1983 made for tv movie based on the true life story of movie sex symbol Rita Hayworth. Its not hard to imagine Carter as the voluptuous Hollywood goddess. However, not much else is adequate here in re-telling what must be an amazing story of a brilliant Hollywood career. Even though this TV movie was based on the popular bio novel on Rita Hayworth, much of the movie is over simplified and few scenes ring true. The viewer is  left with your typical stereotyped Hollywood starlet rise to fame story.

There is however, one great reason to hunt down this video. Actually, there are two. One is the great music soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin ( mission impossible, once a thief ). The other is the brilliant performance by Michael Lerner as the loud-mouth cigar chomping Hollywood  producer. A role he would later re-create and perfect in the Coen Brothers masterpiece BARTON FINK. Someone must of sent a reel of Lerner in this role to the Coen Brothers. Because the similarities of both characters are uncanny. So, now you have actually two others reasons to check this out besides Lynda Carter's body! -sideshowvideo",1219708800,4,1162,4.8
