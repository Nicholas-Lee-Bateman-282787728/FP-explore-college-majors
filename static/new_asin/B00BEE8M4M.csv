8566936,5,B00BEE8M4M,"I have six or seven film versions of Les Miserables and I think that this is the best. Victor Hug's plot is faithfully rendered and the acting, especially that of Lino Ventura is admirable. The cinematic qualities are all excellent. It has a weakness in that the voices are dubbed in English. Thus Jean Valjean is acted by Mr. Ventura but speaks in a mediocre English accent missing completely the complex cadences of Mr. Ventura's voice. Subtitles would have been preferable. Even better, Mr. Ventura who was fluent in English could have dubbed his French voice.",1447027200,,563,4.875
