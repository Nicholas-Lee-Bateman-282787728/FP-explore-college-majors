8473266,5,B005HMHP4K,"Even though this series is all about Hank Moody, blundering clueless lover of people in general and women in particular, the real entertainment is in watching his associates make spectacles of themselves (or vice versa), surpassing his unwitting charm and absurdly engaging pathos with their own unbelievable, unmentionable, social antics.  The writing and acting here is superb, and except for a few oddly miscast characters (Becca, Hank's daughter, whose unexpectedly round dark features permanently fix her in mind as Goth, rather than the vivacious blond Valley Girl you might expect, given the potential story appeal) the ensemble is an absolute joy to watch.  Hank and Karen's heart-tugging, bitter-sweet, never-quite-navigable love story is just icing on the cake. I was compelled to watch all episodes in one sitting! A solid five stars indeed.",1358380800,,852,5.446969696969697
8473267,1,B005HMHP4K,"The quality of all 4 seasons in this package deal look like pirated bootleg copies! The play back quality is poorer than VHS!  All the seasons are very blurry and pixelated...  I also, really wonder if these are valid products approved and distributed by Showtime?  I seriously doubt it!!!",1343606400,6,289,4.857142857142857
8473268,1,B005HMHP4K,quality looks like a pirated movie.  the quality is poor.  out of focus.  images are blurry  i wonder if this is a valid product approved by showtime.  you would be better off recording directed from your own televsion.,1337990400,7,219,4.657894736842105
8473269,5,B005HMHP4K,"David Duchovny's character is wonderfully flawed; He's intelligent, extremely funny and has a big heart, but for some reason, can't say no to drugs, alcohol or women.  He was also unable to commit to the love of his life/mother of his child, so she left him.  The show starts out with Hank Moody (David Duchovny)trying desparatly to win her back.  He sill has a grip on her heart, but his flaws keep pushing her away.  This is one of the central themes to the show, through every season thus far.

One of Moody's other traits, which I can very much relate to, is that he doesn't have patients for public displays of rudeness/ignorance.  He'll often react in the best way possible (some of these reactions might have gone through my head had I witnessed such displays, but I don't think I'd carry them out!)  Such situations often end in my laughter and his imprisonment.

Californication isn't necessarily for children.  There is frequent foul language, drug/alcohol use, and nudity/sex.  Anyone watching it, however, will probably see past that and find something very human in this show.  Watching Hank Moody try and try again is sometimes painful, and sometimes very inspiring. Some things I take from this show is that maybe we as people need to be a little more thoughtful of others, and at the same time, maybe embrace a little more ""political incorrectness.""

I could probably expand on all that quite a bit, but I'm sure everyone would just rather watch the show than read my ramblings!",1336608000,4,1494,4.770428015564202

He was so thrilled, and we both loved every minute of watching it! we had been living out of the country and never seen it, caught a few reruns once on a trip home....GREAT show! Tad raunchy at times, but hey, we are not prudes by any means ;) Funny, naughty, entertaining...pretty sure every man wishes for the life of Hank Moody...",1331596800,2,390,4.507042253521127
