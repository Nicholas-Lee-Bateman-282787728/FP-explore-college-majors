7904571,3,B000006NEH,"Greetings from Tromavile!
Many years ago, I was just starting to get into Troma. I was at Suncoast purchasing ""Stuck On You"", when I saw this film. Since I was determined to become a Troma junkie, I bought it and was plesantly suprised!
I guy leaves a girls school his fortune. When they come to clean it, they stay the night and death starts happening. As the body count is rising, the guts start flying!
Incase this plot doesn't entice you, you'll be pleased to know that some editions of the tape contain the ""Troma System"" informercial. The informercial contains Lloyd Kaufman, Joe Flieshaker, Debbie Rochon, and all the wonderful Troma muntants!
In conclusion, whether you're a Troma fan, or not, you'll find something intetesting in ""Girl School Screamers"".
