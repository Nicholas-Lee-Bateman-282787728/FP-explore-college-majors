6042357,3,B00G0INDXC,"Toward the end of this series, the Jack McCoy character really seemed too angry and argumentative, really forced.  Not sure whether it's the writing or actor or both.",1433548800,,166,4.928571428571429

6042359,3,B00G0INDXC,"In all honesty, I didn't care much for the later seasons of Law and Order which had little by little gone over to the dark side of political correctness, unjust plea bargains, and laws that give every advantage to the criminal with little to no regard for victim. But it is what it is. In real life a drug dealer may get fifty years, while a cold blooded murderer walks because somebody doesn't file the right paperwork in a timely fashion, some cop leaves a word or two out of Miranda, or can't prove the gun was in plain sight, which doesn't require a search warrant, or the case is thrown out  because the defense attorney says something the judge rules prejudicial....and blah, blah, blah.

 Anyway, I had the first seventeen seasons and the final three just continued the steady deterioration of our real life legal system, so  I decided to complete the series despite the fact that I pretty much anticipated what they'd be like.",1433030400,3,934,4.608433734939759
6042360,5,B00G0INDXC,"i gotta say, this line up was awesome.  det bernard is my favorite after det briscoe.  maybe it's because i associate them with other movies and think it's really cool to seem them in a serious role.

6042385,4,B00G0INDXC,"All in all I guess a good end to the series. I got to where I enjoyed the different characters in different places. I miss a lot of the older characters, but this is why Law & Order seems close to real life. Now if they would only investigate & prosecute crimes other than murder. It's been a great twenty years & I only need one more season to complete the collection.",1447718400,,369,4.138888888888889

8619897,2,B00G0INDXC,"This series is GREAT! Every day I watched one or two episodes. I was addicted to it, I loved it. Until I saw Sixteenth Year's 6th episode called ""Glasgowman's Wrath"". In this episode couple of girls go missing (Attention! Spoiler alert!!) and when they are found one of them is visited by her parents in the hospital, two mothers. A homosexual couple. They are wonderful. They are fuzzy and warm and caring. I was OK with the two moms. Than I saw, also in Sixteenth year, episode 9, a serial rapist who was humming Christian hymns while raping his victims. As it turned out he was a Christian man, he was even singing in the church choir. I am tired of Hollyweird's agenda pushing that all homosexual people are wonderful and Christians are monsters. I would've given 1 star for the above reasons but added one more star because I did LOVE the previous ""normal"" episodes. I am very disappointed in the Mariska Hargitay who is not only a GREAT actress but also a wonderful producer. I am pretty sure she has Hungarian ancestors (both her names 1st name and family names are typical Hungarian names) that Hollyweird was able to trick her into buying and abide by their agenda. Shame. I will not watch any more episodes.",1511222400,,1217,4.587155963302752

8619900,3,B00G0INDXC,"By this season, Law and Order had lost or diluted what had made it a stellar show. I have seen every season up through 16 (when I skipped a few few to buy 20 because it was on sale) so it might have been a slow descent, but to me it felt like an abrupt drop in quality and change in tone.

If these shows had belonged to any other series, they would have been fine. Law and Order set the bar so high for itself, however, that this last season just doesn't measure up. The acting quality is still there, and it's a big part of what saves some of the frankly ridiculous scenes (there's a lot of The Magic of Tech saving the day, which felt like laziness on the part of the writers and really, really annoyed me as a viewer).

I also really didn't care for the sidetracks into the personal lives of the characters. One of the characters in particular faces a major issue so I can understand the desire to draw that storyline out more, but I by far prefer earlier seasons' quick, crisp glimpses into characters' personal lives that left me wondering and thinking over bland sentimental scenes that felt manipulative.",1503100800,,1112,4.341346153846154
