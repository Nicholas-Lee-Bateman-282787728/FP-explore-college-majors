8258387,5,B0015G7ET8,"I am a sucker for non-card tricks (I still love them but there's too many of them out there already) so this one was nice. Ever since seeing David Blaine pull off a trick like this with Harrison Ford, it would be cool to learn something like this (you can simply search ""David Blaine Harrison Ford trick"" or anything similar to the search terms on youtube.) Do note that that Twinkies are not included in this package D:

8258388,5,B0015G7ET8,"I've purchased several products from Magic Makers and almost always have been pleased with them. This item is no exception..
The DVD not only demonstrates the card in cake trick, but I was pleased to discover there are several other tricks explained as well. The format used is to first demonstrate the trick and then to explain/show how it is performed step-by-step.

Clear teaching, with the visuals from the DVD, make this a very helpful and useful item. I also appreciate learning how something seemingly magical can be explained.

I received this item for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",1464912000,,613,4.941747572815534
8258389,4,B0015G7ET8,"If you're fairly new to the magic community, then this dvd has some really good tricks to help build your routine.  I think most of these tricks would be great in table-side performances at restaurants or at a magic bar.
And there are a couple tricks here that even a veteran magician would love.
I received this order at discount for my honest review.",1464825600,,352,4.5
