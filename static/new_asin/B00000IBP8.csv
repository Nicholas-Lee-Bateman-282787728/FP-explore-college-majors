Beautiful animation, thrilling storyline; everything an anime fan could  want and more arrives in the form of this spectacular series. Enough good  things cannot be said for the deep characterizations, complex politics, and  incredible mecha sequences. This series is an absolute must-see for any  otaku.",962236800,,451,5.222222222222222
