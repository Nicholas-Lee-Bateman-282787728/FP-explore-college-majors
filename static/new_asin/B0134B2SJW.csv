7360287,5,B0134B2SJW,"This is an important film as it provides a balanced presentation of Gene Clark's valuable contribution to music and his personal challenges.  Arguably, Gene Clark is one of the best songwriters to rise from the 1960's.  I was a Byrds fan back in the day, but didn't fully appreciate the individuals in the group until they splintered and reformed for the Reunion album in 1973.  By then Crosby was a superstar with CSNY; Chris Hillman had formed the Burritos and was a key member of Manassas; Roger had sustained the Byrds for years and was beginning his successful solo career; and Michael Clarke was soon to regain success with Firefall after several years in the background.  Gene Clark had been writing music and exploring rock and country music genres since leaving the Byrds after two albums but, with very little fanfare.  ""The Byrd Who Flew Alone"" does a great job covering his life as a musician and as a vulnerable human being.

Watch this movie, then take a closer look at his body of work.  All of Gene's albums are available on Amazon.  Start with his early albums, check out his early 80s work with McGuinn and Hillman and don't miss his collaboration with Carla Olson.  More importantly, watch for the impending 2016 release of ""Gene Clark - The Lost Sessions 1964 - 1982"" from Sierra Records.

Recommend this essential film to people who are not familiar with Gene. His music will find it's way into their hearts and souls quickly.  Isn't that what we expect from music?",1460505600,20,1486,4.72093023255814

8726983,5,B0134B2SJW,"This is a very intimate look at the late, great co-founder of The Byrds, Gene Clark.  Arguably the most underrated member of the band, Clark's musical career and personal-family life are documented eloquently with tons of testimonials from his musical peers like fellow surviving Byrd bandmates Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman; former fellow Minstrel Barry McGuire; former singing partner Doug Dillard of Dillard & Clark; as well as Clark's living nuclear family relatives.  Gene Clark's songwriting prowess and smooth vocalization are praised like no other by all others in this polished film.  Clark's story of being bitten by the show business bug, creating magnificently but suffering internally, is one many people can relate to on a personal level.  It is interesting how Clark never stayed with any one musical act for more than a period of 1-2 years.  Sometimes the biggest geniuses are like that--always wanting to try something new to stay mentally fresh.
There are also some neat bonus features on the DVD--including extended interviews with the people mentioned above focusing on different aspects of Gene Clark's personal and musical character, and some solo musical performances by Gene himself.
For anybody who admires the artistry of Gene Clark, The Byrds, and/or the world of Folk-Rock music, this is the video for you!  It also serves as a nice well-rounded counterpart to The Byrds Under Review documentary from 2007--which does not feature any interviews with McGuinn, Clark, Crosby or Hillman, and covers separate but equal ground to The Byrd Who Flew Alone.
You will definitely learn a lot from watching this terrific documentary.  I for one was amazed to learn that Clark took up permanent residency in Mendocino, CA following his heyday(s) in Los Angeles.  A very similar life pattern held true for one of my own late grandparents!",1516492800,2,1870,5.189368770764119
8726984,5,B0134B2SJW,"A fantastic portrait of the late great Gene Clark.  Beautifully and informatively done with rare archive footage and many interviews with people who worked with Gene over the years.  It was nice to see interviews with Carla Olson.  Back in the 80's I used to work in a prominent record shop in New Haven, CT and one of the music marketing companies that called me every week was called Macy-Lippman.  Carla was the rep that I spoke to on the phone and a sweeter gal you couldn't find.  When she came to town with her band The Textones we had dinner together.  This was around the time that she was working with Gene.  This dvd is a real gem in every way that spotlights one of music's most underrated artists.",1495843200,4,709,4.407692307692308
8726985,5,B0134B2SJW,"A GREAT documentary about the Byrd who is usually forgotten. He was a magnificent songwriter and singer who later had an up-and-down solo career even though his songs were absolutely superb.

I am just so grateful that someone did a documentary about this great nearly-forgotten man of rock music.",1493164800,3,297,5.061224489795919

 you have to see it for yourself to truly appreciate it. All I can say is If  really love Gene Clark's musical genius as much as I do, then buy this movie, watch it over and over again, you will not regret it, I's that good.",1468022400,6,358,3.810810810810811

A very good documentary. Also contains an interview with him and his singing two songs previously unseen and unheard.",1461456000,8,276,4.226415094339623
