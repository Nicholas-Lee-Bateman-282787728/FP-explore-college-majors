8371307,1,B002IYDR9M,This was basically an interview of some interesting people... Kind of like. Mike Douglas show of the 1970's... Didn't really Hearn anything except that there are cool people out and interviewers that have them in their shows .. Good music at the end ... You will not learn any personally relevant info or practices IMHO.,1467590400,,320,4.836363636363636
8371308,1,B002IYDR9M,"I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about auras and chakras.  The DVD starts with a guy with girl hair talking for a minute and then putting on some woman with big hair and a low cut blouse who calls herself the ""vagina doctor."" I honestly went back to amazon.com to make sure I had not accidentally ordered some weird porn. This DVD is like an SNL spoof!  I could not believe that they were actually trying to be serious.  Then, to top it off, the next guest he brings on is a woman who calls herself an ""urban mermaid,"" who sings some hippie song at the end.  They are all about promoting their personal websites and just being as strange as they can be.  I actually lent this DVD to others just because they couldn't believe it could really be THAT weird...but we are all in agreement that IT IS! If you are looking for something to watch while stoned, this would be it.  If you are looking to learn more about auras and chakras, look elsewhere.",1291939200,8,951,4.284916201117318
