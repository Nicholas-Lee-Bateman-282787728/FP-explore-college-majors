I found this 2 disc set for under 6 bucks, why not I said.  It was a great purchase.  The movies were exciting to watch, not bad for $3 Blu-ray discs.  I recommend these movies, the plots are interesting, not 'Armageddon' special effects but more than good enough, and for brand new Blu-ray discs for under 3 bucks makes this product well worth the money.

3036026,1,B000YV2EFY,"This movie is so bad it is a shame that some good actors wasted their time & talents in it.  The plot defies logic so many times it is reminiscent of the old Monty Python shows ... but without any humorous elements.  The music was so pretentious (and too loud most of the time -- it won the competition with the actor's dialogue) the video and the plot seemed more like the background to the music.  The ""special effects"" were poor at best -- and that's probably being too generous.

What they witness along the way is awe-inspiring, terrifying, and unexplainable. It is also just the beginning...

Despite what the majority thinks, I thought 2012: Doomsday was an okay movie. Dale Midkiff, Cliff DeYoung and Ami Dolenz put in excellent performances. However, I think work could have been done on the screenplay as well as the digital effects. It wasn't horrible, by any means...but it could've used a little work to make it better. I love disaster movies. I love B-grade disaster movies, even more. I would have given it a better rating but there were several reasons why I didn't. None of which I will air here. Overall, I feel it could've been better and could have pitched a better message to those viewing it.

3036043,1,B000YV2EFY,"I can't believe that my husband and I sat and watched even half of this movie. The acting is some of the worst I have seen and the scene where the man fell when the earth split apart was such a joke.  The movie kept jumping back and forth to San Diego and about 5 cities in Mexico and the times were not in sequence.  This was by far the worst movie I have seen in many years and we watch a lot of movies of many different genres.  It was painful to watch some of the acting.  I felt sorry for the actors making themselves look so bad.  Then again, I don't, because they subjected themselves to acting in this movie and were paid on top of it.  Unfortunately, another movie, The Apocalypse, by Faith Films was included with this movie and it was just as bad, if not worse.  We watched less than 5 minutes of it and had to take it out of the DVD player it stunk so bad.  I would not recommend either of these movies to anyone.

3036046,1,B000YV2EFY,"Here's my advice to anyone considering this movie. Don't waste your time buying or watching it. If, unfortunately you have it in your hands, just enjoy the DVD cover. That's the best it's going to get. This is a perfect example of how good, but misguided God-fearing people, try and hijack popular culture, (i.e. disaster movies), and twist it into their little world. I'm sure it will be a relief to Christians everywhere that their salvation will come by the wisdom of human-sacrificing Mayans. I've got nothing against that and I'm glad this movie saw fit to enlighten me to their point of view. Interesting. Very interesting.

Seriously, this movie shows no saving grace. Not even in an unintentionally funny way. There are a few, but sparsely sprinkled goofs:
* For the first part of the film, Dale Midkiff's dialog contains the phrase, ""Get out of here!"", every other paragraph of script.
* A dizzy, spinning, camera on a monologue between Dale and his separated wife.
* Later, a celibate confessional between the above husband and wife.
* The young couple who can't seem to find the guy's car and proceed to walk for miles. Somehow the car is ""just over the hill"", in the middle of nowhere, when they need it.
* A couple of really bad budget scenes of monologue delivered in an ambulance and airplane. Both look like they were shot on a junior high auditorium stage.
* When the heroine's car breaks down I could swear she swears, but they cut in the dialogue, ""Oh, no!""
* A hail storm that strikes and just suddenly stops so the heroine can say a last prayer to her friend. Not to mention a very lengthy dying scene that in real life would have lasted a quarter of the time.
* The unbelievable easy, or truly sad, willingness of some of the characters to just give and die. Come on people, you need to fight for life. It isn't just handed to you!!!
* The credits which include the extremely long list of ""background players"". I'm surprised they didn't give credit to Pastor Joe or Nun Mary.

Basically, this was a project thought up to find an interesting, yet unsuccessful in my book, way of inputting God-speak into a poorly conceived film. It's also very embarrassing to see the good Anglos ""saving"" the people of Latin America. What would they do without these wonderful Americans? Thank all graces theirs an Anglo to help the forgotten Mexican, mother to be, deliver her ""bloody show"" onto the Mayan alter. Her sacrifice that, I guess, takes the place of real human sacrifice that the schooled Mayans practiced? Spolier alert: there is a new beginning and it comes from the Mayans, at least according to this movie's interpretation. I maybe wrong, but I really don't think that's what the producers wanted us to believe but that's the message they deliver. I guess that's the punch line to this movie. And, in retrospect that is pretty darn funny!!!",1347667200,2,2861,4.674603174603175

3036061,3,B000YV2EFY,"""2012: Doomsday"" and  ""The Apocalypse"" are on this double-sided DVD.  They portray two different interpretations of Christianity, one Calvinistic and one more free-will.

""2012: Doomsday"" is all predestined and predetermined, so the movie is a road trip movie that concludes at a Mayan pyramid.  Little suspense or surprises exist; the characters have no free will and are not believable or compelling.  The dialogue is preachy and impossibly frustrating to hear.  And the ending of the movie contradicts everything that happened before, which undermines the literal interpretation of the book of Revelations has been hammered home for 90 minutes.  Two stars maximum, possibly only one star because nothing happens.

""The Apocalypse"" is far more dramatic and unpredictable.  Pseudo-scientific explanations are proposed, and characters behave in a believable way.  ""The Apocalypse"" is a relationship movie between the characters and between the characters and the Christian god.  The acting and special affects are a grade above that seen in ""Doomsday"".  Three stars, possibly four stars for acting.

The version of the DVD that I purchased contains the digital version of both movies, which is a great bonus.

If you buy this double-feature DVD, buy it for ""The Apocalypse"".",1313280000,3,1274,5.466666666666667

Only for pay, and I'm talking a minimum of six figures, should anyone ever consider watching this movie. Waste of Time, Waste of Money, Waste of Film!",1308355200,3,572,5.010526315789473
3036063,1,B000YV2EFY,"There was so much wrong with this movie its hard to say what's right. Dale Midkiff and De Young as stars promised more than was delivered (but at least they can act). The acting of the supporting cast was atrocious. Ami Dolenz' EMT was particularly badly done for a professional actor. The others were almost painful to watch esp. Dolenz' 'mom', but they weren't professionals. Sadly, actors becoming Christians apparently means never acting w/professionals again.

Wasn't expecting a xtn movie btw, just a B 2012 knockoff. The forced 'God is leading us' dialogue bought that home. The best special effects were on the box. No, that's not fair. The cross being a stone-churning key at the end was actually nicely done I thought. But what was the prophecy? That they'd be there. Well....OK.

Oddly badly done scenes- faux 'tension' at the geology office. The acting couldn't carry that through so they hammed-up the music. Amusingly inappropriate music. In fact, in a lot of places, the music was overwhelming the dialogue and the scene. Oh, the faux blizzard. At first I thought the CGI was supposed to be pollen! Again, I get 'no money', OK, then don't overreach! At least CGI some 'snow' on the ground. Had the writers or producers never seen 'snow' before? Or understand how 'snow' acts to cover leaves, branches, and ground? Oh and when they took the pregnant woman to the temple (why? to fulfill prophecy. What prophecy? Why important? No clue.), did they bother to ask her if she would prefer a doctor maybe?

Its really sad a christian-based movie feels it has to be the badly acted, poorly written ugly step-child of even badly acted, poorly written B movies. Seems you could drive home some xtn concepts of sticking together, trusting in a higher power without being ham-fisted about it.",1301702400,,1796,4.862745098039215
3036064,2,B000YV2EFY,"As much as I love The Asylum and their steady stream of cheap knock-offs of Hollywood blockbusters, I have to admit that my guys took a big whiff on this one.  Most of The Asylum's films are either hilariously bad or, on occasion, even better than the film being ripped off (Paranormal Entity, for example).  Something went horribly wrong with 2012: Doomsday, though; this movie just isn't any good at all.  It's not all The Asylum's fault, however, as the company made this film in association with a production company called Faith Films.  At first, I couldn't understand all of the criticism about this being Christian propaganda (as if there is anything wrong with trying to spread God's message through the popular medium of film) because, believe you me, The Asylum is not in the business of preaching Christianity - and even if they were, this film proves that they're not any good at it.  It turns out, though, that Faith Films does have a Christian agenda (2012: Doomsday is part of something they call their End Times collection).  I still don't see the problem.  It's not like this film is beating you over the head with calls to repent or anything; the Christian angle they tack on to Mayan prophecy is downright weird - I'll grant you that - but the ""propaganda"" aspects of this film basically consist of some prayer and some discussions about seeing the beautiful side of life and accepting whatever path God has put you on.  I don't know about you, but God and prayer would certainly be two of my priorities if an ""end of days"" was falling all around my head.

Getting back to the story, it turns out that the Mayans were spot on with their prediction of the end of the age on December 21, 2012.  Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, super storms, and all sorts of nasty natural disasters are happening all over the world as the earth begins to stop spinning around its axis.  While most of the people on the planet start to panic and evacuate to safer ground, several individuals find themselves mysteriously drawn to the ancient Mayan pyramid at Chichen Itza.  The first is an archaeologist who is trying to fulfill the Mayan prophecy he has just discovered (which involves an utterly inane and laughable connection between the Mayans and Christianity).  Then there's the missionary in Mexico who believes God has given her an integral role to play in this historic time - and her father, who just wants to find and protect his daughter from the impending global catastrophe.  Representing the atheistic crowd is a paramedic from California compelled to go to Chichen Itza for reasons she can't explain.  And, despite the reference in the movie summary to four strangers coming together, there's actually a fifth person along for the ride, in the form of a very pregnant Mayan woman.

The whole story is inane, filled with way too much boring dialogue, but it is the special effects that really make 2012: Doomsday such an embarrassment.  First off, don't expect to ooh and aah at a lot of harrowing shots of Mother Nature throwing the mother of all tantrums.  Every so often, the ground cracks open, but there is almost nothing in the way of explosions, floods, and the like.  You can only do so much with a budget of roughly a quarter of a million dollars, but I still expect better than just shaking the camera to represent an earthquake or adding digital snow and hail to simulate the cold temperatures suddenly inundating even the jungles of Mexico.  The special effects in this film really are nothing short of laughable.

So there you have it - 2012: Doomsday is one of the most boring and unenjoyable doomsday films ever produced.  I think the whole ""Christian propaganda"" criticism is overblown, but that still leaves plenty of other problems dragging this film down into the ranks of the nearly unwatchable.  It's just too bad the Mayans didn't include a warning about this film somewhere in their doomsday prophecies - or maybe they did, and those stinking conquistadors destroyed it.",1301529600,8,4018,4.77456647398844

3036067,1,B000YV2EFY,"Spoiler Alert - but youll thank me.

This turkey has all the production values and sensibilities of a 70s porn movie. Weighed down by heavy-handed, didactic christian dialog as wooden as the cross itself, this movie sinks to unfathomable depths. Its a high-school treatment of an inane plot crammed full of notions that are not even half-baked.

In the wake of a series of natural  astronomical, geological and climatic events, scientists, as well as other characters, all leap to religious understanding on the basis of no evidence - no surprise given the context of the message being pounded into the audience with the force of Thors hammer. Generally bad acting completes the crime.

I'm a completely non-religous person, but I am able to suspend my beliefs when it comes to movies and novels - and take their themes and ideas on their own terms to see where they lead, if they are presented with intelligence. This movie is a journey with an incompetent guide who, along with his hapless followers, discovers too late that he has no idea what he is doing. This movie gets 1 star, because you cant give zero stars.

Its not a disaster movie. Its a disaster of a movie. If you want to see this theme presented intelligently, whether you're a believer or not, see Michael Tolkins thoughtful and thought-provoking movie The Rapture.",1296691200,,1332,4.824561403508772

3036080,1,B000YV2EFY,"I first saw this movie in the $4 ""please take this garbage off our hands"" bin at the store I work at. There were some stills of some pretty nifty looking special effects on the cover.
  I truly enjoy disaster films with well-executed special effects so I decided to watch it on an online movie service we have. I am so very glad that I didn't waste my $4 on buying it, but I will never be able to recover the time I wasted watching it. On the bright side, the running commentary my proudly science nerd son provided made it worthwhile.
  On to the movie itself. The basic premise has been covered in other reviews....as well as the title. There are definitely strong religious overtones. Four primary characters who seem led by a Divine Power to a Mayan pyramid while the planet falls apart around them. Erm, those nifty disaster stills on the box cover don't show up in the movie. In fact there aren't any real disaster scenes. Scenes of cold and blizzard in Central America are accomplished by throwing fake snow and poorly done CG snow around, while you can clearly see bright sunlight shining through. I especially loved a scene where they pan away from two characters gasping their way through a ""blizzard"" and you can very clearly see the rails set out for one of the cameras.
  The acting was pretty bad overall. The storyline was not thought out at all. It was really nothing more than a feeble attempt by Asylum films to cash in on 2012 (Roland Emmerich's film) and a little of the Christian rapture ""Left Behind"" saga.
  Important note here. While the Mayan civilization fell, there are still plenty of Mayan people around who are well acquainted with their culture and history. Any one of them will tell you the Mayan long count calendar does not predict any kind of disaster or doomsday at the end. It simply starts over again.
  The crossing of our solar system over the galactic plane is made much of in most of these 2012 predictions as well. The sun rotates with our galactic arm, and also moves up and down like a carousel horse. In the process it crosses the galactic plane about once every 30 million years. It last did this about 3 million years ago. Humanity may never see a crossing, as the next one won't be for about 27 million years.
  I will recommend this movie for anyone that loves to watch movies that just beg for a mystery science theater 3000 treatment. (Are you listening MST3000?) Anyone else, save your time and money and skip this one,",1292198400,,2472,4.517937219730942
3036081,3,B000YV2EFY,"First let me say I am a major fan of disaster movies; they are armchair adventures for me and I watch a lot of them. This movie, for plot, acting or special effects in no way comes even close to matching 2012, the major movie release of last year.  This particular movie is made on a very small budget; if you have watched any of the disaster movies shown on the SYFY channel, you have a good idea what you are in for here. There are computer generated special effects, some pretty good, some pretty obvious, such as the subzero blizzard in the tropics that doesn't seem to bother the plants at all or make the actors appear to be particularly cold in their tropical clothing. On the plus side, the movie was largely filmed in Belize using at least some footage of a Mayan temple, which helps a bit there.  The basic plot of the movie has various people attempting to get to a Mexican Mayan pyramid by Dec. 21st in order to fulfill a Mayan/Christian prophecy.  There are some major holes in the logic of the film, such as why the Mayans would incorporate Christianity into the design of a pyramid long before the arrival of the Spanish,  but NOT incorporate it into their lives and culture. The movie is produced by a company called Faith Films which explains why,  several times in it's approximately 80 minute running time,  it seems to grind to a halt to deliver a mini-sermon. Most of the action takes place in out of the way locations and involves a small number of people; considering the world is threatened with total destruction,  I am not sure where the rest of us are and why we don't seem to care; are we all hiding in our basements?  I bought this double feature disc on impulse in Walmart for under $10.  All in all, for a small investment like this, assuming your expectations aren't too high, you probably won't be too disappointed.",1291248000,,1848,4.459940652818991
3036082,1,B000YV2EFY,"Forget ""Christian propaganda"".  Asylum films is simply trying to make a buck by making cheap knock-offs of popular movies by producing similar themes and near identical titles.  I bought this for $5 at Walmart, and I am sorely tempted to soak in in gasoline and toss it in the air so I can shoot it with a shotgun and get some satsifaction out of this abomination.

First off, let me say that the sound and audio mixing in the movie are TERRIBLE. I was constantly having to crank the volume up to hear what was being said in one part, only to have to turn it down when sound effects or music suddenly started blasting.  Conversations are recorded at different levels throughout the film, and apparently little or no effort was spent on equalizing it.

Next, the acting. I HAVE seen worse - far worse. I will be generous and say that the acting was B-movie grade. Honestly, I blame more of the disappointment on bad editting: some scenes dragged on painfully longer than they should have, while other seemingly important points were skipped or rushed past. It was extremely hard to sit through the whole thing - thankfully I was helping cook dinner while I watched, and could easily spare most of my attention in the kitchen without missing a single plot point.

Special effects: well, whomever did the special effects for this dog must have ridden the ""short bus"". Bright sunny lighting while straw blows through the air? Snow falling in scene after scene, again on bright sunny days with absolutely no build up on the ground, or even wetness? Dark gloomy sky with a huge tornado - people running away in terror - camera pans down to a nice sunny street - what the??? There was a scene with the station wagon careening wildly down the highway trying to dodge hailstones (really?) smashing off the pavement everywhere; suddenly the driver is killed by a hailstone through the windshield and apparently God (or the Director) was satisfied because the car comes to a halt and no more hailstones - even on the ground outside. The altar room scene done in CGI was about the only special effect I won't complain about.

Timeline - an AMAZING amount takes place in a should 28 hour period. Perhaps the ""slowing down of the Earth's rotation"" can account for it all, but I sure can't. 5 hour flights and 12 hour drives compressed into 1 or 2 hours? I ... never mind.

Just take my (and everyone else's) word for it - this movie is sheer torture to watch. If you want a good Apocalypse movie, try the real 2012, or Apocalypse, or Deep Impact, The day after tomorrow, or even Tycus.  If you want a good Revelations movie, try Left Behind or Omega Code, or Tribulation Force.",1289692800,,2663,4.5777310924369745

3036088,3,B000YV2EFY,"It would appear that I am a maverick when it comes to this film; I didn't think it was terrible, just confused. I was able to watch it all the way through without falling out of my chair with laughter or falling asleep and I thought there were some moments when the acting came across very convincingly.

I do not buy into the ideas circulating about 2012 being the end of the world; as an Evangelical Christian I am completely convinced the Bible's account of the end of the world is entirely correct and it isn't in 2012. There are a lot of things the Bible says will happen before the world comes to an end; there will be a major renovation but that happens several years after the next thing on the list which just happens to be the Rapture.

I was interested in noting that some Christian soteriology and eschatology in bits and pieces was included in the film, but the final picture of the end times as described was completely off base from the Bible's teachings on the subject. I'll not go into what I think the Bible teaches about the end times but it is drastically different from what was presented in the movie.

I too thought the effort to tie Christian eschatology in with the Mayan calendar was feeble and ill-advised. Having said all that, I did find the movie tolerable and thought it even had some exciting moments. There is hardly a movie out there that is totally free of bloopers and if this movie had so many that it took extra time to watch it then that scores much better in the laugh department than some so-called comedies; maybe it'll establish itself as a cult comedy.

3036101,1,B000YV2EFY,"**SPOILERS**
(which is not really a big deal as no one should have to sit through this movie anyway)

The premise is that ""European Christians"" came to the new world centuries before Columbus and that the Mayans were really Christians and the end of the Mayan calendar coordinates with the Rapture, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, and who knows what else. In fact, inside a Mayan temple at Chichen Itza, there is an inscription that prophesied a child would be born on the temple altar at the end of days. A character in the film reads off the prophecy like it was English but apparently no one else in the world has ever bothered to look at it (the word ""Christ"" appearing carved in a Mayan temple would be a monumental discovery!).

The Rapture occurs somewhere along the way, and the faithful disappear, though at least a couple of the main characters are believers (one is actually a missionary) and they get left behind (I'd be a bit disappointed in their shoes) to carry the Word to the rest of those left behind.

Which apparently will include only the people who are living in and around Chichen Itza, because we see the West Coast of the US get wiped out and the entire continent go dark, so our band of heroes aren't going anywhere for a while and will be much busier trying to stay alive in the middle of the jungle, far away from any sort of civilization.

Overall, a ridiculous story, horrible acting, and seems almost an anti-Christian film as it is generally unscriptural and attempts to reconcile pagan Mayan practices (those altars were used for human sacrifice!) with Christianity.

Not recommended for Bible-believing Christians, out-and-out atheists, friends, neighbors or anyone at all, not even your worst enemies. Absolutely no redeeming elements in this movie whatsoever.",1274400000,,1791,4.839869281045751
3036102,1,B000YV2EFY,"This is honestly one of the worst movies ever made. My boyfriend and I rented this film by mistake, thinking it was the recent 2012 blockbuster hit. This was anything but. The first 5-8 minutes were nothing but dramatic music and footage from a plane flying over a river. The acting was painful to watch and there were only about 20 total actors (background extras included) in the movie. The graphics were very, very cheesy and poorly done; if I didn't know better, I would've thought I was watching a skit from MadTV. The plot was not very believable. Most of the film praises Christianity but for some reason mixes Christian prophecy with Mayan prophecy. The 'science' in the movie seems like it was made up by a 12 year old-- I'm surprised the movie didn't mention the sun revolving around the earth; all the while the plot seems to subtly bash science and technology and praise religion (actually, I don't think ""subtly"" is the best word, maybe ""explicitly""). I'm willing to bet that the person that wrote up the story for this movie failed both high school physics and biology then later went on to drop out of Bible College. It is supposed to be a Christian propaganda film, but it even fails at that; don't get me wrong, I myself am a woman of faith, but this movie was ludicrous at best and flat out blasphemous at worse. The quoted Bible verses in the movie are actually quoted wrong, being basically paraphrases of the actual verses with pieces of Old English here and there to make it seem legit. They also threw in a woman having a baby, and somehow that was supposed to save the world after the rapture(?)...yes, they added the rapture into this too. Everyone in the film was conveniently a Christian, aside from a paramedic who was an Atheist..of course, they stereotyped her as being a non-believer due to tragedy in the world and made her vehemently praise science and technology. Let me reiterate, they bash they very science and technology in this movie they fail to understand.  They failed to understand science when they wrote this far-fetched story line and they failed to understand technology when they added in the atrocious computer graphics. Nevertheless, in addition to being of a horrible quality (that is, poor acting, substandard camera angles, bad lighting, God-awful computer graphics) it was also extremely preachy (about topics the creator of this film knew NOTHING about) and just a flat out insult to Christians, non-Christians, logical thinkers, and anyone with a high school education or higher.

The scenery was good, the acting was not.  Then again, the lines were so stupid that it would be hard to put in a good performance.  We have the mother just disappearing out of the car into the rapture, we have the ice in the driver and the gal praying for his salvation as the pregnant woman screams in the back seat, the tiny plane with the disappearing pilot, the non-believer quoting Thessalonians, the little gal with the tiny cough, and on and on ad infinitum.

This is easily one of the worst movies that you could buy or rent from Redbox, like a ""Perfect Storm"" of bad filmmaking.  It has a laughable story, bad acting, overdone CGI effects, and a long list of errors and inconsistencies.

When you watch a science fiction movie, you obviously have to leave your sense of reality at the door.  But some of the story lines are laughable.  Early into the film, we get our first shot of the Blonde looking for a doctor as she crosses the bridge.  Seconds after the screen flashes her location as being in Veracruz, Mexico, she stops a local man to ask for help.  Conveniently, the guy is wearing a shirt with a big flag of El Salvador on it.  It's a given that the film wasn't shot in Mexico, but it's almost like the Central American extras were playing a joke on the director.  This is also right up there with the paramedic making a 2,000 mile drive from San Diego to Chichen Itza in less than a day.

I gave the film two stars instead of one, simply because I loved the footage of Central America that was included in this otherwise weak movie.  If you see this one at your local Redbox kiosk, skip it.",1272067200,,1248,4.359307359307359

My favorite dumb moments.

The Christian God is setting up these pasty white people to meet up at a Mayan temple to fulfill a prophecy made by Mayans that were, at one point, exterminated by white Christians. Nice plan God.

An archeologist and his ex-wife are struggling through the jungle. She is bleeding and almost dead. They alone can save the Earth. However, they take 10 minutes to reminisce about when they met, confess their chastity and apologize profusely to each other. ""No, it was MY fault"".

The archeologist opens the temple with the butt end of a massive crucifix when any simple square object would have done. Why wouldn't the archeologists that spent decades unearthing this temple have tried that? And the inside of the temple has lighting!

The blonde missionary's father manages to get a flight to Mexico from the U.S. after ordering the evacuation of the entire Western seaboard. But there are no traffic jams or problems getting a flight? Same goes for the mother/daughter leaving San Diego. No traffic during the evacuation of 75 million people? Plus he flies in on a little Cessna during an apocalyptic storm.

The blonde, non-believing paramedic takes off with a stranger after her mother has disappeared from the side of the road for all of 3 minutes. What if she just went for a pee? No, the atheist paramedic concludes it must be the rapture. Of course that's what any atheist would think.

3036114,1,B000YV2EFY,"2012 DOOMSDAY is a semi-Christian based movie that is marketed as being similar to THE OMEGA CODE and the first LEFT BEHIND movie.  Unfortunately, there really aren't any similarities between those two movies and 2012 DOOMSDAY other than the typical ""conversion"" scene that often pops up in Christian-made and based movies.  Not only that but THE OMEGA CODE and LEFT BEHIND are really subpar movies, but compared to 2012 DOOMSDAY they are almost cinematic masterpieces.

The plot of the movie seems simple enough.  A group of archeologists uncover a seemingly anachronistic crucifix in a Mayan ruin in South America.  The relic sets off a set of terrible natural disasters that cause havoc worldwide, including a massive tornado that destroys most of California, massive tidal waves that eradicate entire large islands, and a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that threaten to destroy most of the continent of South America.  The world's best scientists have no explanation for what is happening.  Meanwhile the archeologist who found the relic feels destined to deliver it to another Mayan temple where he can use it to fulfill a prophecy. In addition, there's a young female Christian missionary (her dad is the lead scientist trying to figure out what is going on) and a pregnant woman on the verge of giving birth that feel compelled to go to the temple to.  They can't find a doctor to help with the birthing process, but are able to find a wandering med student who joins them on their journey.  Finally, there's also a young female paramedic who has been having dreams about this Mayan temple and ends up driving there.  All of these people headed to the same place, either to stop the end of the world or bring about a new one.  Mix in some mixed-up Christian elements and Mayan prophecies about 2012 and that's the movie.

In general, I like B-movies. If the story is good, I even enjoy watching no-budget amateur movies.  When a first time director or a new film company comes along, I give them the benefit of the doubt.  I was even looking forward to watching 2012 DOOMSDAY, even though I knew it was from the same movie company that produced SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL (one of the worst movies I've ever seen).  The opening scenes seemed interesting enough, bland but expositions usually are. Unfortunately, things just went downhill from there.  I will say that most of the actors and actresses were attractive. Also, some of the special effects were well used. Other than that, there's really nothing I can say to recommend this movie, except that at times it's unintentionally funny.

The scientists at the beginning of the movie talk about a black hole that is threatening to destroy the Earth, but the black hole is never seen or heard about again.  There's a pregnant woman running around South America, but instead of going to see a doctor to deliver her baby goes for a road trip with her missionary friend. The dialogue is terrible. Other than a brief message about the salvation offers, very little of the religion in the movie is even Biblically base.  The rapture occurs, but the most righteous person in the film (the Christian missionary) is left behind. The lighting effects are horrible.  There were parts of the movie that looked like they were filmed at dusk with a cell phone camera and no other lights. There's a point in the movie when large balls of hail begin falling from the sky.  These pieces of hail or so massive that they can shatter not only through glass, but through a human body as well. The entire sequence is quite tacky, but so is much of the movie.

2012 DOOMSDAY is a terrible movie.  I'd recommend that you only watch it if you're looking for a movie that works well for Mystery Science Theatre 3000-style riffing.",1232496000,6,3772,4.778120184899846

At this point I was still interested to see how the film would come together, and was even willing to completely bypass the terrible acting in order to see 2012 come to life in a way that I've only imagined from some of the books and research I've done myself.  Let me say now, that not only was the acting horrendous, the storyline sucked, and I felt like I was watching a really corny version of Touched by an Angel.  The whole flick completely took chosen bits and pieces of the ancient Mayan prophecy and made it into a Christian propoganda film.  I am a Christian so I can appreciate my faith and appreciate what it is I believe in, but watching someone take two separate and completely different prophecies to try and sell the apocolypse honestly just pissed me off.  I like how the people 'called' to do the Lord's work were all American, and the females were two blondes who questioned their belief in a higher being.  The whole rapture thing being tied with the whole mayan temple thing...completely broken, made NO sense and I feel like I just lost an hour and a half of my life watching that garbage.

Then he makes the statement that this is the only theory that makes sense.

Some lucky cast members were ""raptured"" prior to the great disaster.  Why wasn't the missionary raptured?

Ultimately, the moment comes when all light is extinguished on Earth, then the girl gives birth and the light comes back out.

3036134,1,B000YV2EFY,"Ok this movie made me laugh so hard it is WAY funnier than 99% of the comedies out there. From the actors forgetting their lines to the horrible special effects and props, this movie is a joke.

I wrote a review because this is the kind of stuff I wanted to read when I checked out the reviews. The reviewers skipped some things so I'm going to list some of them that I found completely ridiculous. DON'T READ THE REST OF THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

-First of all the lighting was horrible. People looked either dead or infected with vampirism.

-At one point the camera completely juddered while doing a pan of the landscape like the cameraman fell sideways.

-In the beginning the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is discussed. So I was like oh the Solar System is being sucked into a supermassive black hole maybe this movie will be cool. Never again is this black hole mentioned and I was wrong about the movie being cool.

-The blonde non-nurse girl was searching for a doctor for weeks and finds someone who had done a few years of med school and is completely unhappy and unsurprised.

-The news that showed California with tornado warnings on the screen: Tornado warnings? Looked more like a hurricane the size of california. The words from the news report were even half cut off the mother's tv screen.

-There were some winds outside at one point and there were only these strange string type things floating around. What the hell were those? And why did sometimes huge clumps of them fall?

-Despite the unbearable acting, the actors forgot their lines throughout the movie. I guess after take 143 of a scene they just went with the best shot they had. The worst part though was when the male news reporter was talking about the parts of the world that had been affected. He stuttered and paused like Billy in one flew over the cuckoo's nest. He wasn't on video you just hear his voice, so he was probably reading off a paper and still he butchered his lines!

-The snowball scene which was joked about previously. C'mon. And why was he swerving? Not to mention the size of the hole in the windshield was not even an inch wide.

-The pilot of the small plane was going to willingly and pointlessly kill himself after he dropped off the dad.

-The end in the temple when the horrible male actor was surprised that a pregnant woman showed up RIGHT after he read the prophecy and considering he hasn't seen a single random person for miles and miles of driving and walking.

-Then right after when the father and daughter reunite it was just weird and hilarious with the music.

-Once when the words were being typed near the end of the movie the words OVERLAPPED a little! How could they not notice this?

I'm not joking I was cracking up the ENTIRE movie. An 85 minute movie took 2 hours because we had to keep pausing it to laugh. Normally I am maybe a little too forgiving when it comes to movies as I seem to like alot of them. However, this movie was a big joke. I loved it, but not for the reasons I should have. I agree with a previous reviewer, this is THE worst movie I have ever seen.",1208304000,33,3140,4.419410745233969
3036135,2,B000YV2EFY,"Several predictions based on different calendars and calculations
make 2012 the Mayan predicted end of the world. This movie tries to make secular Christian use of that in a pretty blatant way.
The sci fi science basis of the planet standing still

3036136,1,B000YV2EFY,"...but failed miserably. My family just grabbed this film off the shelf at the rental place - we had no idea it was a Christian film. About halfway through, they really start hitting the viewers with the ""jesus stick"" which really doesn't appeal to non-Christians and takes away from any dignity the plot may of had (barring all the other horrible elements of the film).

As others have pointed out, this film is an awkward blending of Christianity and Mayan predictions of the end of the world. Could of been an interesting idea but it was presented very badly, just thrown together with little explanation, making it difficult to suspend disbelief. The way the Christian element was presented was rather sudden,  with characters going from a secular existence at the start to suddenly speaking as if to a congregation. It felt forced and heavy-handed and unlike any Christians I know in real life.

The digital effects were horrible, the weather effects looking ""painted-on"". The hail scene was downright laughable, defying reality, and the earthquake scenes were obviously done by a crew who have not experienced or researched earthquakes (I come from an earthquakey place myself). Other elements were very distracting in their lack of forethought. Like the two men in a two-seater plane flying from California to the Yucatan without refueling and retaining the ability to speak to one another without headsets (a personal pet peeve). Just two examples, but the film is plagued by these sorts of holes. The science-speak is like this as well - at least most films TRY to make the lingo believeable but anyone off the street could pick apart everything these people say.

The acting wasn't the worst I have seen; I think the actors simply had horrible dialogue, trite and over-the-top, with bad directing. The movie tries hard but because the plot is so thin, everything comes off as laughably over-dramatic. I don't know if it was my audio set up but it also seemed like they used a lot of voice-overs. In a few spots you can see actors speaking but no words are heard or you can hear dialogue but no one is moving their mouths.

The cinematography itself isn't too shabby with some lovely scenic shots and a few interesting compositions here and there. The lighting is done well, although in many places (like in the temple, for instance)  it is painfully fake. Some artistic camera movements are over-used to the point of distraction, seemingly incorporated ""because they could"", not because they should.  The editing between scenes in the first half is particularly dis-jointed and abrupt, making it hard for the viewer to immerse themselves in what little story there is.

Overall, I could see what the creators of this film were going for, and I could see how it could of been done well; it could have done justice to Christian viewers without alienating outsiders but in the end it had so little cohesion between elements that the film fails to be anything other than dull and even laughable in every department.",1206662400,5,3021,4.875243664717349
3036137,2,B000YV2EFY,"This movie is a lame and shallow attempt to blend Mayan Cosmology with Christian fundamentalist dogma. The completely convoluted premise that (somehow!) Christians found their way to Mexico in 600 A.D. begins this sappy religious tale. A Christian crucifixion cross is found in a Mayan temple and this inexplicably brings 5 people together in Chichen-Itza.

So much is unexplained, and the mixing of Christianity and Mayan cosmology never gels. The illogical phrase ""new beginnings"", inserted as dialog, is oxymoronic to this movie, which never gets off the ground. Some apocalyptic science is literally thrown in for effect, without any continuity whatsoever. My favorite part was when hail the size of baseballs falls and never hits the windshield of the SUV ... until ONE piece plunges through the windshield and into the chest of the driver!?!

Save your money and buy (or borrow) the book, ""Galactic Alignment"" by John Major Jenkins. Someone involved with the screenplay of this movie has some (incredibly minor) knowledge of the information in this book, but apparently never bothered to put much of it in the movie.",1205971200,6,1122,5.193370165745856
3036138,1,B000YV2EFY,"The scenery at the beginning was beautiful, but the movie went downhill from there. I liked Cliff de Young in the Love series and expected that this movie would be wonderful because he was in it. The acting was bad.  The dialogue was amateurish and stupid, often with contradictory ideas contained within one sentence, so that even Cliff de Young's acting looked pitiful. I laughed out loud when one actress said that the president was evacuating the entire west coast, the earth's rotation had slowed, causing catastrophes all over the world and the end of the world, but her father wanted her to go north to Oklahoma where she would be safe.  There was also a statement that European Christians had been in Mexico long before Christopher Columbus. After watching the first half of the movie, I turned it off.  It was worse than an old 1950s B grade.
The people who put this movie together must have been a bunch of college kids who, even though they had good intentions, are not very talented.  They put together the Mayan 2012 Doomsday calendar with the Rapture/End of the World belief held by Eschatologist Christians.  The Roman Catholic Church and most mainline protestant denominations (of which I am a member) do not believe the end of the world will occur as a Rapture and/or a Tribulation period.  Belief in the Rapture is mostly confined to Fundamentalists and other Evangelicals. After Christianity became the official religion of Rome in the fourth century CE, this belief was declared a heresy and suppressed.  The idea of a Rapture was reintroduced in 1830 by John N. Darby, a minister of the Church of Ireland.
Regardless of whether one believes in the Rapture or not, the movie was amateurish.  It was so bad that I tried to get my money back from the rental store.",1205884800,24,1782,4.744336569579288

That's the best it's going to get. This is a perfect example of how good, but misguided God-fearing people, try and hijack popular culture, (i.e. disaster movies), and twist it into their little world. I'm sure it will be a relief to Christians everywhere that their salvation will come by the wisdom of human-sacrificing Mayans. I've got nothing against that and I'm glad this movie saw fit to enlighten me to their point of view. Interesting. Very interesting.

Seriously, this movie shows no saving grace. Not even in an unintentionally funny way. There are a few, but sparsely sprinkled goofs:
* For the first part of the film, Dale Midkiff's dialog contains the phrase, ""Get out of here!"", every other paragraph of script.
* A dizzy, spinning, camera on a monologue between Dale and his separated wife.
* Later, a celibate confessional between the above husband and wife.
* The young couple who can't seem to find the guy's car and proceed to walk for miles. Somehow the car is ""just over the hill"", in the middle of nowhere, when they need it.
* A couple of really bad budget scenes of monologue delivered in an ambulance and airplane. Both look like they were shot on a junior high auditorium stage.
* When the heroine's car breaks down I could swear she swears, but they cut in the dialogue, ""Oh, no!""
* A hail storm that strikes and just suddenly stops so the heroine can say a last prayer to her friend. Not to mention a very lengthy dying scene that in real life would have lasted a quarter of the time.
* The unbelievable easy, or truly sad, willingness of some of the characters to just give and die. Come on people, you need to fight for life. It isn't just handed to you!!!
* The credits which include the extremely long list of ""background players"". I'm surprised they didn't give credit to Pastor Joe or Nun Mary.

Basically, this was a project thought up to find an interesting, yet unsuccessful in my book, way of inputting God-speak into a poorly conceived film. It's also very embarrassing to see the good Anglos ""saving"" the people of Latin America. What would they do without these wonderful Americans? Thank all graces theirs an Anglo to help the forgotten Mexican, mother to be, deliver her ""bloody show"" onto the Mayan alter. Her sacrifice that, I guess, takes the place of real human sacrifice that the schooled Mayans practiced? Spolier alert: there is a new beginning and it comes from the Mayans, at least according to this movie's interpretation. I maybe wrong, but I really don't think that's what the producers wanted us to believe but that's the message they deliver. I guess that's the punch line to this movie.

""2012: Doomsday"" is all predestined and predetermined, so the movie is a road trip movie that concludes at a Mayan pyramid.  Little suspense or surprises exist; the characters have no free will and are not believable or compelling.  The dialogue is preachy and impossibly frustrating to hear.  And the ending of the movie contradicts everything that happened before, which undermines the literal interpretation of the book of Revelations has been hammered home for 90 minutes.  Two stars maximum, possibly only one star because nothing happens.

""The Apocalypse"" is far more dramatic and unpredictable.  Pseudo-scientific explanations are proposed, and characters behave in a believable way.  ""The Apocalypse"" is a relationship movie between the characters and between the characters and the Christian god.  The acting and special affects are a grade above that seen in ""Doomsday"".

The acting of the supporting cast was atrocious. Ami Dolenz' EMT was particularly badly done for a professional actor. The others were almost painful to watch esp. Dolenz' 'mom', but they weren't professionals. Sadly, actors becoming Christians apparently means never acting w/professionals again.

Wasn't expecting a xtn movie btw, just a B 2012 knockoff. The forced 'God is leading us' dialogue bought that home. The best special effects were on the box. No, that's not fair. The cross being a stone-churning key at the end was actually nicely done I thought. But what was the prophecy? That they'd be there. Well....OK.

Oddly badly done scenes- faux 'tension' at the geology office. The acting couldn't carry that through so they hammed-up the music. Amusingly inappropriate music. In fact, in a lot of places, the music was overwhelming the dialogue and the scene. Oh, the faux blizzard. At first I thought the CGI was supposed to be pollen! Again, I get 'no money', OK, then don't overreach! At least CGI some 'snow' on the ground. Had the writers or producers never seen 'snow' before? Or understand how 'snow' acts to cover leaves, branches, and ground? Oh and when they took the pregnant woman to the temple (why? to fulfill prophecy. What prophecy? Why important? No clue.), did they bother to ask her if she would prefer a doctor maybe?

3270561,2,B000YV2EFY,"As much as I love The Asylum and their steady stream of cheap knock-offs of Hollywood blockbusters, I have to admit that my guys took a big whiff on this one.  Most of The Asylum's films are either hilariously bad or, on occasion, even better than the film being ripped off (Paranormal Entity, for example).  Something went horribly wrong with 2012: Doomsday, though; this movie just isn't any good at all.  It's not all The Asylum's fault, however, as the company made this film in association with a production company called Faith Films.  At first, I couldn't understand all of the criticism about this being Christian propaganda (as if there is anything wrong with trying to spread God's message through the popular medium of film) because, believe you me, The Asylum is not in the business of preaching Christianity - and even if they were, this film proves that they're not any good at it.  It turns out, though, that Faith Films does have a Christian agenda (2012: Doomsday is part of something they call their End Times collection).  I still don't see the problem.  It's not like this film is beating you over the head with calls to repent or anything; the Christian angle they tack on to Mayan prophecy is downright weird - I'll grant you that - but the ""propaganda"" aspects of this film basically consist of some prayer and some discussions about seeing the beautiful side of life and accepting whatever path God has put you on.  I don't know about you, but God and prayer would certainly be two of my priorities if an ""end of days"" was falling all around my head.

Getting back to the story, it turns out that the Mayans were spot on with their prediction of the end of the age on December 21, 2012.  Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons, super storms, and all sorts of nasty natural disasters are happening all over the world as the earth begins to stop spinning around its axis.  While most of the people on the planet start to panic and evacuate to safer ground, several individuals find themselves mysteriously drawn to the ancient Mayan pyramid at Chichen Itza.  The first is an archaeologist who is trying to fulfill the Mayan prophecy he has just discovered (which involves an utterly inane and laughable connection between the Mayans and Christianity).  Then there's the missionary in Mexico who believes God has given her an integral role to play in this historic time - and her father, who just wants to find and protect his daughter from the impending global catastrophe.  Representing the atheistic crowd is a paramedic from California compelled to go to Chichen Itza for reasons she can't explain.  And, despite the reference in the movie summary to four strangers coming together, there's actually a fifth person along for the ride, in the form of a very pregnant Mayan woman.

The whole story is inane, filled with way too much boring dialogue, but it is the special effects that really make 2012: Doomsday such an embarrassment.  First off, don't expect to ooh and aah at a lot of harrowing shots of Mother Nature throwing the mother of all tantrums.  Every so often, the ground cracks open, but there is almost nothing in the way of explosions, floods, and the like.  You can only do so much with a budget of roughly a quarter of a million dollars, but I still expect better than just shaking the camera to represent an earthquake or adding digital snow and hail to simulate the cold temperatures suddenly inundating even the jungles of Mexico.  The special effects in this film really are nothing short of laughable.

So there you have it - 2012: Doomsday is one of the most boring and unenjoyable doomsday films ever produced.  I think the whole ""Christian propaganda"" criticism is overblown, but that still leaves plenty of other problems dragging this film down into the ranks of the nearly unwatchable.  It's just too bad the Mayans didn't include a warning about this film somewhere in their doomsday prophecies - or maybe they did, and those stinking conquistadors destroyed it.",1301529600,8,4018,4.77456647398844

This turkey has all the production values and sensibilities of a 70s porn movie. Weighed down by heavy-handed, didactic christian dialog as wooden as the cross itself, this movie sinks to unfathomable depths. Its a high-school treatment of an inane plot crammed full of notions that are not even half-baked.

I'm a completely non-religous person, but I am able to suspend my beliefs when it comes to movies and novels - and take their themes and ideas on their own terms to see where they lead, if they are presented with intelligence.

  I truly enjoy disaster films with well-executed special effects so I decided to watch it on an online movie service we have. I am so very glad that I didn't waste my $4 on buying it, but I will never be able to recover the time I wasted watching it. On the bright side, the running commentary my proudly science nerd son provided made it worthwhile.
  On to the movie itself. The basic premise has been covered in other reviews....as well as the title. There are definitely strong religious overtones. Four primary characters who seem led by a Divine Power to a Mayan pyramid while the planet falls apart around them. Erm, those nifty disaster stills on the box cover don't show up in the movie. In fact there aren't any real disaster scenes. Scenes of cold and blizzard in Central America are accomplished by throwing fake snow and poorly done CG snow around, while you can clearly see bright sunlight shining through. I especially loved a scene where they pan away from two characters gasping their way through a ""blizzard"" and you can very clearly see the rails set out for one of the cameras.
  The acting was pretty bad overall. The storyline was not thought out at all. It was really nothing more than a feeble attempt by Asylum films to cash in on 2012 (Roland Emmerich's film) and a little of the Christian rapture ""Left Behind"" saga.
  Important note here. While the Mayan civilization fell, there are still plenty of Mayan people around who are well acquainted with their culture and history. Any one of them will tell you the Mayan long count calendar does not predict any kind of disaster or doomsday at the end. It simply starts over again.
  The crossing of our solar system over the galactic plane is made much of in most of these 2012 predictions as well. The sun rotates with our galactic arm, and also moves up and down like a carousel horse. In the process it crosses the galactic plane about once every 30 million years. It last did this about 3 million years ago. Humanity may never see a crossing, as the next one won't be for about 27 million years.
  I will recommend this movie for anyone that loves to watch movies that just beg for a mystery science theater 3000 treatment. (Are you listening MST3000?) Anyone else, save your time and money and skip this one,",1292198400,,2472,4.517937219730942
3270578,3,B000YV2EFY,"First let me say I am a major fan of disaster movies; they are armchair adventures for me and I watch a lot of them. This movie, for plot, acting or special effects in no way comes even close to matching 2012, the major movie release of last year.  This particular movie is made on a very small budget; if you have watched any of the disaster movies shown on the SYFY channel, you have a good idea what you are in for here. There are computer generated special effects, some pretty good, some pretty obvious, such as the subzero blizzard in the tropics that doesn't seem to bother the plants at all or make the actors appear to be particularly cold in their tropical clothing. On the plus side, the movie was largely filmed in Belize using at least some footage of a Mayan temple, which helps a bit there.  The basic plot of the movie has various people attempting to get to a Mexican Mayan pyramid by Dec. 21st in order to fulfill a Mayan/Christian prophecy.  There are some major holes in the logic of the film, such as why the Mayans would incorporate Christianity into the design of a pyramid long before the arrival of the Spanish,  but NOT incorporate it into their lives and culture. The movie is produced by a company called Faith Films which explains why,  several times in it's approximately 80 minute running time,  it seems to grind to a halt to deliver a mini-sermon. Most of the action takes place in out of the way locations and involves a small number of people; considering the world is threatened with total destruction,  I am not sure where the rest of us are and why we don't seem to care; are we all hiding in our basements?  I bought this double feature disc on impulse in Walmart for under $10.  All in all, for a small investment like this, assuming your expectations aren't too high, you probably won't be too disappointed.",1291248000,,1848,4.459940652818991
3270579,1,B000YV2EFY,"Forget ""Christian propaganda"".  Asylum films is simply trying to make a buck by making cheap knock-offs of popular movies by producing similar themes and near identical titles.  I bought this for $5 at Walmart, and I am sorely tempted to soak in in gasoline and toss it in the air so I can shoot it with a shotgun and get some satsifaction out of this abomination.

First off, let me say that the sound and audio mixing in the movie are TERRIBLE. I was constantly having to crank the volume up to hear what was being said in one part, only to have to turn it down when sound effects or music suddenly started blasting.  Conversations are recorded at different levels throughout the film, and apparently little or no effort was spent on equalizing it.

Next, the acting. I HAVE seen worse - far worse. I will be generous and say that the acting was B-movie grade. Honestly, I blame more of the disappointment on bad editting: some scenes dragged on painfully longer than they should have, while other seemingly important points were skipped or rushed past. It was extremely hard to sit through the whole thing - thankfully I was helping cook dinner while I watched, and could easily spare most of my attention in the kitchen without missing a single plot point.

Special effects: well, whomever did the special effects for this dog must have ridden the ""short bus"". Bright sunny lighting while straw blows through the air? Snow falling in scene after scene, again on bright sunny days with absolutely no build up on the ground, or even wetness? Dark gloomy sky with a huge tornado - people running away in terror - camera pans down to a nice sunny street - what the??? There was a scene with the station wagon careening wildly down the highway trying to dodge hailstones (really?) smashing off the pavement everywhere; suddenly the driver is killed by a hailstone through the windshield and apparently God (or the Director) was satisfied because the car comes to a halt and no more hailstones - even on the ground outside. The altar room scene done in CGI was about the only special effect I won't complain about.

Timeline - an AMAZING amount takes place in a should 28 hour period. Perhaps the ""slowing down of the Earth's rotation"" can account for it all, but I sure can't. 5 hour flights and 12 hour drives compressed into 1 or 2 hours? I ... never mind.

Just take my (and everyone else's) word for it - this movie is sheer torture to watch. If you want a good Apocalypse movie, try the real 2012, or Apocalypse, or Deep Impact, The day after tomorrow, or even Tycus.  If you want a good Revelations movie, try Left Behind or Omega Code, or Tribulation Force.",1289692800,,2663,4.5777310924369745

I was able to watch it all the way through without falling out of my chair with laughter or falling asleep and I thought there were some moments when the acting came across very convincingly.

I do not buy into the ideas circulating about 2012 being the end of the world; as an Evangelical Christian I am completely convinced the Bible's account of the end of the world is entirely correct and it isn't in 2012. There are a lot of things the Bible says will happen before the world comes to an end; there will be a major renovation but that happens several years after the next thing on the list which just happens to be the Rapture.

I was interested in noting that some Christian soteriology and eschatology in bits and pieces was included in the film, but the final picture of the end times as described was completely off base from the Bible's teachings on the subject. I'll not go into what I think the Bible teaches about the end times but it is drastically different from what was presented in the movie.

I too thought the effort to tie Christian eschatology in with the Mayan calendar was feeble and ill-advised. Having said all that, I did find the movie tolerable and thought it even had some exciting moments. There is hardly a movie out there that is totally free of bloopers and if this movie had so many that it took extra time to watch it then that scores much better in the laugh department than some so-called comedies; maybe it'll establish itself as a cult comedy.

(which is not really a big deal as no one should have to sit through this movie anyway)

The premise is that ""European Christians"" came to the new world centuries before Columbus and that the Mayans were really Christians and the end of the Mayan calendar coordinates with the Rapture, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, and who knows what else. In fact, inside a Mayan temple at Chichen Itza, there is an inscription that prophesied a child would be born on the temple altar at the end of days. A character in the film reads off the prophecy like it was English but apparently no one else in the world has ever bothered to look at it (the word ""Christ"" appearing carved in a Mayan temple would be a monumental discovery!).

The Rapture occurs somewhere along the way, and the faithful disappear, though at least a couple of the main characters are believers (one is actually a missionary) and they get left behind (I'd be a bit disappointed in their shoes) to carry the Word to the rest of those left behind.

Which apparently will include only the people who are living in and around Chichen Itza, because we see the West Coast of the US get wiped out and the entire continent go dark, so our band of heroes aren't going anywhere for a while and will be much busier trying to stay alive in the middle of the jungle, far away from any sort of civilization.

Overall, a ridiculous story, horrible acting, and seems almost an anti-Christian film as it is generally unscriptural and attempts to reconcile pagan Mayan practices (those altars were used for human sacrifice!) with Christianity.

Not recommended for Bible-believing Christians, out-and-out atheists, friends, neighbors or anyone at all, not even your worst enemies. Absolutely no redeeming elements in this movie whatsoever.",1274400000,,1791,4.839869281045751
3270599,1,B000YV2EFY,"This is honestly one of the worst movies ever made. My boyfriend and I rented this film by mistake, thinking it was the recent 2012 blockbuster hit. This was anything but. The first 5-8 minutes were nothing but dramatic music and footage from a plane flying over a river. The acting was painful to watch and there were only about 20 total actors (background extras included) in the movie. The graphics were very, very cheesy and poorly done; if I didn't know better, I would've thought I was watching a skit from MadTV. The plot was not very believable. Most of the film praises Christianity but for some reason mixes Christian prophecy with Mayan prophecy. The 'science' in the movie seems like it was made up by a 12 year old-- I'm surprised the movie didn't mention the sun revolving around the earth; all the while the plot seems to subtly bash science and technology and praise religion (actually, I don't think ""subtly"" is the best word, maybe ""explicitly""). I'm willing to bet that the person that wrote up the story for this movie failed both high school physics and biology then later went on to drop out of Bible College. It is supposed to be a Christian propaganda film, but it even fails at that; don't get me wrong, I myself am a woman of faith, but this movie was ludicrous at best and flat out blasphemous at worse. The quoted Bible verses in the movie are actually quoted wrong, being basically paraphrases of the actual verses with pieces of Old English here and there to make it seem legit. They also threw in a woman having a baby, and somehow that was supposed to save the world after the rapture(?)...yes, they added the rapture into this too. Everyone in the film was conveniently a Christian, aside from a paramedic who was an Atheist..of course, they stereotyped her as being a non-believer due to tragedy in the world and made her vehemently praise science and technology. Let me reiterate, they bash they very science and technology in this movie they fail to understand.  They failed to understand science when they wrote this far-fetched story line and they failed to understand technology when they added in the atrocious computer graphics. Nevertheless, in addition to being of a horrible quality (that is, poor acting, substandard camera angles, bad lighting, God-awful computer graphics) it was also extremely preachy (about topics the creator of this film knew NOTHING about) and just a flat out insult to Christians, non-Christians, logical thinkers, and anyone with a high school education or higher.

When you watch a science fiction movie, you obviously have to leave your sense of reality at the door.  But some of the story lines are laughable.

Seconds after the screen flashes her location as being in Veracruz, Mexico, she stops a local man to ask for help.  Conveniently, the guy is wearing a shirt with a big flag of El Salvador on it.  It's a given that the film wasn't shot in Mexico, but it's almost like the Central American extras were playing a joke on the director.

The archeologist opens the temple with the butt end of a massive crucifix when any simple square object would have done. Why wouldn't the archeologists that spent decades unearthing this temple have tried that? And the inside of the temple has lighting!

The blonde missionary's father manages to get a flight to Mexico from the U.S. after ordering the evacuation of the entire Western seaboard.

3270611,1,B000YV2EFY,"2012 DOOMSDAY is a semi-Christian based movie that is marketed as being similar to THE OMEGA CODE and the first LEFT BEHIND movie.  Unfortunately, there really aren't any similarities between those two movies and 2012 DOOMSDAY other than the typical ""conversion"" scene that often pops up in Christian-made and based movies.  Not only that but THE OMEGA CODE and LEFT BEHIND are really subpar movies, but compared to 2012 DOOMSDAY they are almost cinematic masterpieces.

The plot of the movie seems simple enough.  A group of archeologists uncover a seemingly anachronistic crucifix in a Mayan ruin in South America.  The relic sets off a set of terrible natural disasters that cause havoc worldwide, including a massive tornado that destroys most of California, massive tidal waves that eradicate entire large islands, and a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that threaten to destroy most of the continent of South America.  The world's best scientists have no explanation for what is happening.  Meanwhile the archeologist who found the relic feels destined to deliver it to another Mayan temple where he can use it to fulfill a prophecy. In addition, there's a young female Christian missionary (her dad is the lead scientist trying to figure out what is going on) and a pregnant woman on the verge of giving birth that feel compelled to go to the temple to.  They can't find a doctor to help with the birthing process, but are able to find a wandering med student who joins them on their journey.  Finally, there's also a young female paramedic who has been having dreams about this Mayan temple and ends up driving there.  All of these people headed to the same place, either to stop the end of the world or bring about a new one.  Mix in some mixed-up Christian elements and Mayan prophecies about 2012 and that's the movie.

In general, I like B-movies. If the story is good, I even enjoy watching no-budget amateur movies.  When a first time director or a new film company comes along, I give them the benefit of the doubt.  I was even looking forward to watching 2012 DOOMSDAY, even though I knew it was from the same movie company that produced SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL (one of the worst movies I've ever seen).  The opening scenes seemed interesting enough, bland but expositions usually are. Unfortunately, things just went downhill from there.  I will say that most of the actors and actresses were attractive. Also, some of the special effects were well used. Other than that, there's really nothing I can say to recommend this movie, except that at times it's unintentionally funny.

The scientists at the beginning of the movie talk about a black hole that is threatening to destroy the Earth, but the black hole is never seen or heard about again.  There's a pregnant woman running around South America, but instead of going to see a doctor to deliver her baby goes for a road trip with her missionary friend. The dialogue is terrible. Other than a brief message about the salvation offers, very little of the religion in the movie is even Biblically base.  The rapture occurs, but the most righteous person in the film (the Christian missionary) is left behind. The lighting effects are horrible.  There were parts of the movie that looked like they were filmed at dusk with a cell phone camera and no other lights. There's a point in the movie when large balls of hail begin falling from the sky.  These pieces of hail or so massive that they can shatter not only through glass, but through a human body as well. The entire sequence is quite tacky, but so is much of the movie.

2012 DOOMSDAY is a terrible movie.  I'd recommend that you only watch it if you're looking for a movie that works well for Mystery Science Theatre 3000-style riffing.",1232496000,6,3772,4.778120184899846

Fundamentalist Christians lie and manipulate history, co-opt the traditions of another culture, and use an obscene measure of melodrama to inflict drivel on the unsuspecting viewer. The most charitable  thing that can be said about this film is that it is, at best, insulting and nauseating.",1218844800,6,389,5.174603174603175
3270614,1,B000YV2EFY,"I was really excited to see this film...I actually thought initially that it would be ""The Odessey"" another 2012 film which is a documentary but quickly realized that it was actually a film that acted out a storyline based on 2012 prophecies.  At this point I was still interested to see how the film would come together, and was even willing to completely bypass the terrible acting in order to see 2012 come to life in a way that I've only imagined from some of the books and research I've done myself.  Let me say now, that not only was the acting horrendous, the storyline sucked, and I felt like I was watching a really corny version of Touched by an Angel.  The whole flick completely took chosen bits and pieces of the ancient Mayan prophecy and made it into a Christian propoganda film.  I am a Christian so I can appreciate my faith and appreciate what it is I believe in, but watching someone take two separate and completely different prophecies to try and sell the apocolypse honestly just pissed me off.  I like how the people 'called' to do the Lord's work were all American, and the females were two blondes who questioned their belief in a higher being.  The whole rapture thing being tied with the whole mayan temple thing...completely broken, made NO sense and I feel like I just lost an hour and a half of my life watching that garbage.  If you really want to know about 2012, check out the History Channel's video on it, or ""The Oddessy"" so that you can get an unsensored, real version that makes alot more sense and isn't trying to sell nonbelievers a bogus version of the story.  I hope you read this before you waste your money, it was a complete mess.",1215216000,64,1675,4.468852459016394
3270615,1,B000YV2EFY,"So then Cliff De Young explains why the rotation of the Earth is slowing down.  Actually he explains why it might be slowing down.  Apparently they couldn't measure it in any way so none of our crack scientists know for sure even though they have it timed down to the moment when it will stop.  Then he makes the statement that this is the only theory that makes sense.  I had to go back and replay his explanation of the black hole causing the Earth's rotation to slow and it still made absolutely no sense at all.  None.  Okay, we're beyond that, let's discuss acting.  Well, there wasn't much in this film to discuss.  It was horrible. Special effects? Oh man!!!  Other reviewers mentioned the hail storm where basball size hail was falling all over and the guy was actually swerving the car to miss them as they fell.  That's some sweet driving.  Unfortunately not sweet enough though, for out of these giant pieces of hail, one, about an inch wide it appears from the damage to the windshield does find its mark, and hits the glass, then rips a hole in the driver's chest that looks like the creature from Alien just came out of him.  Some lucky cast members were ""raptured"" prior to the great disaster.  Why wasn't the missionary raptured?  She was the most God fearing person in the film, totally devoted and faithful, yet she was left behind.  Maybe it was to help fulfill the prophecy, but really... That wasn't right.  Ultimately, the moment comes when all light is extinguished on Earth, then the girl gives birth and the light comes back out.  Okay, we lost the West Coast, but other than that, Earth came out of this disaster pretty good.  Well, they did use the last 24 hours to completely evacuate the entire West coast.  Yeah, right.  Well, on the good side, Amy Dolenz was nice to look at.  The bottom line here is that this film will leave you wondering:  If there really is a God, would he allow mankind to make movies this bad?",1212105600,7,1947,4.487179487179487

Is there anything ELSE worth saying?

This film does NOTHING to explain the 2012 ideology. It is horrible. This film is full of people who can't act. The script is just atrocious. The premise: is there one?

Why was SHE added in the mix?

3270631,1,B000YV2EFY,"Ok this movie made me laugh so hard it is WAY funnier than 99% of the comedies out there. From the actors forgetting their lines to the horrible special effects and props, this movie is a joke.

I wrote a review because this is the kind of stuff I wanted to read when I checked out the reviews. The reviewers skipped some things so I'm going to list some of them that I found completely ridiculous. DON'T READ THE REST OF THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

-First of all the lighting was horrible. People looked either dead or infected with vampirism.

-At one point the camera completely juddered while doing a pan of the landscape like the cameraman fell sideways.

-In the beginning the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is discussed. So I was like oh the Solar System is being sucked into a supermassive black hole maybe this movie will be cool. Never again is this black hole mentioned and I was wrong about the movie being cool.

-The blonde non-nurse girl was searching for a doctor for weeks and finds someone who had done a few years of med school and is completely unhappy and unsurprised.

-The news that showed California with tornado warnings on the screen: Tornado warnings? Looked more like a hurricane the size of california. The words from the news report were even half cut off the mother's tv screen.

-There were some winds outside at one point and there were only these strange string type things floating around. What the hell were those? And why did sometimes huge clumps of them fall?

-Despite the unbearable acting, the actors forgot their lines throughout the movie. I guess after take 143 of a scene they just went with the best shot they had. The worst part though was when the male news reporter was talking about the parts of the world that had been affected. He stuttered and paused like Billy in one flew over the cuckoo's nest. He wasn't on video you just hear his voice, so he was probably reading off a paper and still he butchered his lines!

-The snowball scene which was joked about previously. C'mon. And why was he swerving? Not to mention the size of the hole in the windshield was not even an inch wide.

-The pilot of the small plane was going to willingly and pointlessly kill himself after he dropped off the dad.

-The end in the temple when the horrible male actor was surprised that a pregnant woman showed up RIGHT after he read the prophecy and considering he hasn't seen a single random person for miles and miles of driving and walking.

-Then right after when the father and daughter reunite it was just weird and hilarious with the music.

-Once when the words were being typed near the end of the movie the words OVERLAPPED a little! How could they not notice this?

I'm not joking I was cracking up the ENTIRE movie. An 85 minute movie took 2 hours because we had to keep pausing it to laugh. Normally I am maybe a little too forgiving when it comes to movies as I seem to like alot of them. However, this movie was a big joke. I loved it, but not for the reasons I should have. I agree with a previous reviewer, this is THE worst movie I have ever seen.",1208304000,33,3140,4.419410745233969
3270632,2,B000YV2EFY,"Several predictions based on different calendars and calculations
make 2012 the Mayan predicted end of the world. This movie tries to make secular Christian use of that in a pretty blatant way.
The sci fi science basis of the planet standing still
is pretty much nonsense. With global warming being a current concern

3270633,1,B000YV2EFY,"...but failed miserably. My family just grabbed this film off the shelf at the rental place - we had no idea it was a Christian film. About halfway through, they really start hitting the viewers with the ""jesus stick"" which really doesn't appeal to non-Christians and takes away from any dignity the plot may of had (barring all the other horrible elements of the film).

As others have pointed out, this film is an awkward blending of Christianity and Mayan predictions of the end of the world. Could of been an interesting idea but it was presented very badly, just thrown together with little explanation, making it difficult to suspend disbelief. The way the Christian element was presented was rather sudden,  with characters going from a secular existence at the start to suddenly speaking as if to a congregation. It felt forced and heavy-handed and unlike any Christians I know in real life.

The digital effects were horrible, the weather effects looking ""painted-on"". The hail scene was downright laughable, defying reality, and the earthquake scenes were obviously done by a crew who have not experienced or researched earthquakes (I come from an earthquakey place myself). Other elements were very distracting in their lack of forethought. Like the two men in a two-seater plane flying from California to the Yucatan without refueling and retaining the ability to speak to one another without headsets (a personal pet peeve). Just two examples, but the film is plagued by these sorts of holes. The science-speak is like this as well - at least most films TRY to make the lingo believeable but anyone off the street could pick apart everything these people say.

The acting wasn't the worst I have seen; I think the actors simply had horrible dialogue, trite and over-the-top, with bad directing. The movie tries hard but because the plot is so thin, everything comes off as laughably over-dramatic. I don't know if it was my audio set up but it also seemed like they used a lot of voice-overs. In a few spots you can see actors speaking but no words are heard or you can hear dialogue but no one is moving their mouths.

The cinematography itself isn't too shabby with some lovely scenic shots and a few interesting compositions here and there. The lighting is done well, although in many places (like in the temple, for instance)  it is painfully fake. Some artistic camera movements are over-used to the point of distraction, seemingly incorporated ""because they could"", not because they should.  The editing between scenes in the first half is particularly dis-jointed and abrupt, making it hard for the viewer to immerse themselves in what little story there is.

Overall, I could see what the creators of this film were going for, and I could see how it could of been done well; it could have done justice to Christian viewers without alienating outsiders but in the end it had so little cohesion between elements that the film fails to be anything other than dull and even laughable in every department.",1206662400,5,3021,4.875243664717349
3270634,2,B000YV2EFY,"This movie is a lame and shallow attempt to blend Mayan Cosmology with Christian fundamentalist dogma. The completely convoluted premise that (somehow!) Christians found their way to Mexico in 600 A.D. begins this sappy religious tale. A Christian crucifixion cross is found in a Mayan temple and this inexplicably brings 5 people together in Chichen-Itza.

So much is unexplained, and the mixing of Christianity and Mayan cosmology never gels. The illogical phrase ""new beginnings"", inserted as dialog, is oxymoronic to this movie, which never gets off the ground. Some apocalyptic science is literally thrown in for effect, without any continuity whatsoever. My favorite part was when hail the size of baseballs falls and never hits the windshield of the SUV ... until ONE piece plunges through the windshield and into the chest of the driver!?!

Save your money and buy (or borrow) the book, ""Galactic Alignment"" by John Major Jenkins. Someone involved with the screenplay of this movie has some (incredibly minor) knowledge of the information in this book, but apparently never bothered to put much of it in the movie.",1205971200,6,1122,5.193370165745856
3270635,1,B000YV2EFY,"The scenery at the beginning was beautiful, but the movie went downhill from there. I liked Cliff de Young in the Love series and expected that this movie would be wonderful because he was in it. The acting was bad.  The dialogue was amateurish and stupid, often with contradictory ideas contained within one sentence, so that even Cliff de Young's acting looked pitiful. I laughed out loud when one actress said that the president was evacuating the entire west coast, the earth's rotation had slowed, causing catastrophes all over the world and the end of the world, but her father wanted her to go north to Oklahoma where she would be safe.  There was also a statement that European Christians had been in Mexico long before Christopher Columbus. After watching the first half of the movie, I turned it off.  It was worse than an old 1950s B grade.
The people who put this movie together must have been a bunch of college kids who, even though they had good intentions, are not very talented.  They put together the Mayan 2012 Doomsday calendar with the Rapture/End of the World belief held by Eschatologist Christians.  The Roman Catholic Church and most mainline protestant denominations (of which I am a member) do not believe the end of the world will occur as a Rapture and/or a Tribulation period.  Belief in the Rapture is mostly confined to Fundamentalists and other Evangelicals. After Christianity became the official religion of Rome in the fourth century CE, this belief was declared a heresy and suppressed.  The idea of a Rapture was reintroduced in 1830 by John N. Darby, a minister of the Church of Ireland.
Regardless of whether one believes in the Rapture or not, the movie was amateurish.  It was so bad that I tried to get my money back from the rental store.",1205884800,24,1782,4.744336569579288
