5132416,5,B0085AEFJ4,"This is an easy workout for someone who has not exercised in a long time, and I have heard very positive comments from others regarding the results, which I hope to see for myself soon. I tried it for the first time today, and was amazed that I was able to get through the entire workout for the stomach, as I didn't figure that I would be able to do so on the first attempt. You do feel the effects, but with a brief break, I was able to resume and finish. My neck immediately felt better after the stomach routine, which is amazing because even a chiropractor has not helped my neck pain. I am doing this routine for my abdomen, but the neck pain relief is an added bonus.",1363564800,39,674,4.152671755725191
5132417,5,B0085AEFJ4,I just did the stomach and legs workout back to back. Deceptively tough. Looks easy but you can really feel it. I'm excited to see the results in the future!,1361491200,7,157,4.266666666666667
5132418,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I did callenetics in the 80's and 90's. My behind and arms never looked better. Now in my menopause years I started doing barre workouts again. I love this video as I can do a twenty minute workout before work. The Hips and Behind is my fave...There are two positions from Super Callenetics (kneeling pretzels) which are eaisier to follow than the Super Callenetics as Callen gives you the directions while you're doing it, like she did on her first videos. (I love Super Callenetics, but the positioning is all at the beginning before you start the exercises.) I love all my barre videos, Bar Method, Exhale Core Fusion Thighs and Behind, Pure Barre, Physique 57, Burn at the Bar, Lotte Berk Method, but none of them have the counter, or Callen calling the booty a precious peach. As for it being dated these exercises work! As for the clothes and hair, I've always enjoyed fashion history.",1361404800,89,891,4.681528662420382

5132422,5,B0085AEFJ4,"The different Callanetics exercise programs are the best I have ever used. They work for EVERYONE. Young, old, physically disabled, back problems, knee problems, overweight, extremely overweight... these are the ticket to getting you back to feeling and moving better. And quickly. Callan Pinckney had some of these very problems herself when she designed these exercises for her own health. I have used them with my own health issues and seen dramatic differences, very quickly. I have used them since the 80s. I keep coming back to them time and time again. This with adjusting how you eat has the ability to renew your youth and restore your energy and health.",1489190400,3,663,4.981981981981982
5132423,5,B0085AEFJ4,"This seems old fashioned and too ""low impact"" to work, but it's not! I just tried it for the first time (I did both the Behind and the Legs section), and I am sore! Callan walks you through everything in a very intuitive way. Just as I'd be thinking, ""Is this barre too low to be effective?"" or ""Where do I put my foot?"" or ""Is this form OK?"" she would answer the question. I hope I do get results from this, because it feels like I should, and I like doing it.",1485561600,3,461,3.967741935483871

5132425,5,B0085AEFJ4,"If you do these exercises daily you will absolutely see results, even if you're a fitness freak, or if you've never exercised before. Callan does a great job of showing variations of the exercises to make them easier for beginners, and harder once you get the hang of them so they stay effective!",1483660800,5,296,4.60377358490566
5132426,5,B0085AEFJ4,"My wife is really happy because, unlike the gym exercises where the instructor seems to be in a hurry during the exercises, the video literally walks the viewer at the right pace showing both form and right way to do the exercises.  She would recommend it to others who, like her have specific areas of the body they want to maintain their shape toned out.",1482278400,2,356,4.476923076923077

5132431,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I have been doing these exercises on and off for the last 10 year.  They are very effective to tone and tighten everything up very quickly, can be done in a limited amount of space, and while I do break a sweat, I find them more comfortable to do indoors than other, more aerobic types of exercise.  A side benefit is how super relaxed and calm I feel after the workout!  It's like a thoughtful combination of yoga, pilates and dance stretches.  Anyway, although I have the books, and the VHS tapes, it was time to get the CDs.  Great quality and I'm glad to be back in my routine.  I always think I'll just do the 20 minute short routine, but have been doing the full hour lately, as I guess it is getting easier.",1474934400,5,714,4.213235294117647
5132432,4,B0085AEFJ4,"This video is wonderful! I have been exercising with the original Callanetics DVD since the early 1990s. These intense but difficult muscle-engaged exercises give you results fast, perhaps even faster than some other videos I have worked with, I think other types of videos are important, too, though. Check out the newest ones: Pure Callenetics and Extreme Callenetics. They are newer and less monotonous.",1468454400,6,406,5.359375
5132433,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I did her workouts when I was in my 20's after having babies and it worked wonders! Now I'm in my 50's and out of shape so am incorporating this in my new workout routine and hoping for similar results in this older body.

I particularly like this workout because it is segmented into 3 different workouts so I can pick and choose the areas that I need to work on the most. They are very short routines. I do have neck and back problems so find the stomach ones hard on my neck but am trying to power through with breaks as I need because I know in the long run it's probably going to help alleviate my pain.",1466035200,2,608,4.066666666666666

5132445,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I'm so impressed at the results in my legs!  I've been a consistent, 4x a week exerciser for years, using mostly cardio gym equipment and kickboxing routines.  I recently decided to cycle in this video to add a little variety.  My hopes were more for maintenance and something new rather than for transformation, but I was pleasantly surprised!  After only 10 days of alternating between the ""Hips and Behind"" and ""Legs"" videos (so that I did one or the other each day), my ""knee wrinkles"" are gone!  Although my legs overall are toned, I had been noticing those slight over-the-knee sags creeping in the last couple of years...I figured, well, this is what mid-30s looks like and hadn't found a good exercise to target the area.  This isn't my first stint with CallaneticsI was a semi-regular user of Callan's ""10 Years Younger in 10 Hours"" in my 20s, but at an hour in length, it left me wanting to do cardio on top of it and I just didn't have the time to do both workouts regularly.  This video is great for that.  Each segment is 20 minutes in length, and although the exercises are intense they (and Callan's voice!) are relaxing.  I often do this in the evening before bed.  For those familiar with the ""10 Hours"" video, this one is basically all the same moves but organized in a way that each of the three workouts stands alone.  I personally have never been able to do her ab exercises without excessive neck pain (I'm sure it's faulty form rather than the exercise itself) and have yet to figure out a piece of furniture in my house that enables me to correctly do the ""open and close"" exercise, but each section of this video is chaptered so you can skip ahead very easily.  This makes it very easy to tailor it to exercises that are the best for you or that you have time for that given day.  Her ""Legs"" section includes a lot of great stretching, as well as deep muscle work, which keeps your thighs looking long and lean instead of bulky as your muscles get stronger.  And they work fast!  10 days in and the knee wrinkles are gone and my inner thighs are pulled in, too.",1453680000,33,2086,4.438320209973753

5132447,5,B0085AEFJ4,"All of Callan's Callanetics products are worth their weight in cold. However, if you have the original Callanetics DVD, there is no need to purchase this one. She does the same EXACT exercises in both, this one just breaks it down into the areas of the body it works so you can do a part of the workout each day of the week. You can just do a part of the original DVD and press stop when you are done :)",1452988800,4,403,3.9876543209876543

Nothing compares to Callanetics.  If you are like me and just need to upgrade from your old vintage VHS copies of Callan's Callanetic programs, Amazon is the place.

5132452,5,B0085AEFJ4,"Another great addition to my Callanetics library. I love Callanetics & ordered this on the heels of getting the original Callanetics book, the original Callanetics 10 years younger dvd & the Super Callanetics dvd. I wondered if it would be of value or if I was going overboard. It turns out that I'm very glad I got it. The instruction, as always, is top-notch. On this dvd, Callan practices with her students, & there is ever more to glean. Plus I like seeing how she condensed & prioritized the longer routines. This will allow me to add a second shorter routine, if I wish, to the longer full Callanetics sequence I do first thing in the morning. I just discovered Callanetics about a week ago & feel so thankful for it. First of all, I really enjoy the practice. (For reference my other favorite exercise activities are hot yoga--Bikram's Core 26--running, jump roping, rebounding, walking, hiking, hula hooping...) I've also sampled my share of home dvd's (to name a few, Ultimate Yogi, Egoscue, Barre Method, You Are Your Own Gym, Core Fusion, Tonique Mat,  Buns of Steel & more) Each have their benefits, but Callanetics suits me best. I enjoy it as much as hot yoga & running which is saying a lot. It's convenient, effective, meditative & feels amazing. Plus in addition to activating my muscles, it's strengthened my faith in silver linings. I discovered Callanetics only after spraining my ankle (which meant taking a hiatus from both running & yoga). As my ankle recovers, my whole body is being upgraded by this program. My husband chuckled tonight that I'm so into it I watch the dvd's even when I'm not doing them to pick up more technique. Yep, I love Callanetics! Very best wishes to you on your chosen path.",1447372800,10,1725,4.711920529801325

Dedicate yourself to doing 1 segment a night, 20 min, until you have done 10 total.  OR dedicate yourself to doing 1 segment for 10 days in a row.  You will see results. If you do 1 area for 10 days when you go to the next, area don't forget to either incorporate the other area or maybe do it in the morning.

You will change the shape and size of the are you are working.  Callanetics proves you can spot reduce.  Another spot reduce method is T-Tapp. Again NOT the most exciting exercises in town but the results are AWESOME!",1437868800,11,680,4.067669172932331

I am starting over with the DVDs having worked out with her when I was much younger (and still on VHS of course)...What is cumbersome (and therefore not 5 stars) is that if you want to progress from the stomach to the hips and behind, etc. you have to start the tape over.  Not a big deal I guess, but other workout tapes can be programmed to keep moving from one section to the other simply by selecting the workouts in advance.  Nothing negative, because if you want to get the best results in the shortest period of time - this is it!

5132483,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I bought this DVD after it became apparent to me that I could no longer continue lifting weights.  Years ago, I had a serious knee injury.  When I decided to get in shape, I discovered that my knee couldn't handle things like squats and lunges, etc., so I needed to find an alternate that wouldn't be too hard on my prior injuries.  It was purely accidental that I stumbled on Callanetics, but I tried some You Tube video, just to insure that the exercises would be effective without irritating my knee injury.  I tried some Hips and Behind exercises, and they totally kicked my butt.  I'm an at-home mom who homeschools, so I don't have a lot of free time. I bought Quick Callanetics to do for 20 minutes in the morning, and continued walking for 30 minutes in the evenings.

After a couple of months of doing the exercises, I pronounce them to be effective.  I didn't measure more than my waist and hips, but I lost 4 inches from each after 2 months.  Meanwhile, I didn't have to take a break to heal any strains, which I was constantly having to do when I lifted.  As for the reviewer claiming that you don't sweat when doing Callanetics, that is only true if you're not doing it right.  Sure, you won't sweat bucket loads, like you would if you're running.  It's not a cardio exercise, it's resistance.  But it is very effective.",1415318400,36,1333,4.440329218106996

I read some reviews saying these workouts were too easy.  Maybe those reviewers are younger than me (I'm in my 50's) or they've been doing callanetics for a while.  They were NOT easy for me.  She is patient, encouraging, and gives tips, advice and modifications without stopping the routine.",1405900800,18,651,4.338842975206612

5132492,5,B0085AEFJ4,I really like this dvd.  I had the original VHS tapes to it was good to get them on dvd.  Callenetics really works if you stick with it!,1403049600,,136,3.8214285714285716
5132493,4,B0085AEFJ4,Real results.  Not a high level of difficulty. Gentle on back and joints.  Powerful exercise.  Glad to see it back.,1398902400,3,115,4.65
5132494,4,B0085AEFJ4,Wanted an exercise program to do at home on my schedule. This was convenient for my schedule and needs for exercise program.,1398470400,2,124,4.681818181818182
5132495,4,B0085AEFJ4,But low impact is what's it's allllll about; especially those of us with back pain and recovering from surgery.  It's a GREAT way to get your range of motion back without further injury.  Don't get me wrong; if you are doing it correctly you are going to feel it for a couple of days.  Start small and build.,1398038400,5,308,4.275862068965517
5132496,1,B0085AEFJ4,"Can't get the DVD audio to play on English even though it says it will.  I think I have decided that while she may have some interesting moves I prefer a more ""modern"" approach.",1398038400,2,177,4.205882352941177
5132497,5,B0085AEFJ4,Very quick improvement just doing it every day. I think she really understands how to pace the exercises and stretches so you can balance the effect.,1395705600,3,149,4.769230769230769
5132498,5,B0085AEFJ4,Really helpful i Callanentic exercises. The you get a workout while learning to do the exercises. Does take inches off the butt,1395532800,2,127,4.818181818181818
5132499,3,B0085AEFJ4,"I bought this based on the great reviews I read on Amazon, but I'm just not sure it's for me. First of all, It's not terribly difficult. You stay in one position for a long time which is different. I never worked up any type of sweat. Overall walking/running on the treadmill seems to have better results for me. I have also done Pilates and some yoga in the past which I prefer Pilates over this workout. However, I can see where this workout could work if I stuck to it. It does seem like you get a deeper muscle workout. Its just a little boring.",1394236800,,549,4.188679245283019
5132500,4,B0085AEFJ4,"I would have given Callanetics the 5 stars it deserves. Unfortunately, the clarity was not as clear as I'm used to. Irrespective, I still recommend trying because of the advantage of having all 3 of the quick callanetics on one dvd. Even though my dvd doesn't have the best quality picture, it is still clear enough to produce 3 great workouts in 1.",1393286400,3,349,4.555555555555555
5132501,5,B0085AEFJ4,"If you need to just get a quick workout for a certain area the video breaks that down, or sometimes I like to combine all three workouts for a longer session.  There is nothing like old school Callanetics with Callan!",1387238400,3,217,4.425
5132502,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I have done this workout since the 90's.  Nothing is like it, nothing works like it.  It simply can't be ""evolved"" or improved upon.  I look forward to doing it and even after over 20 year I still feel it the next day!",1386201600,22,218,4.023255813953488
5132503,5,B0085AEFJ4,"Callan Pinckney was such a little gem in the exercise world.  So nice to workout to her calming voice, encouraging you to go at your own pace.  I usually go through the entire dvd, but it is nice to have the option to just do one or the other.",1382486400,8,243,3.938775510204082

5132505,5,B0085AEFJ4,"Amazon shipped fast and my item arrived very promptly and was as described.  It is an excellent exercise DVD for the hips, legs, stomach and butt.  I am already feeling positive results without a great deal of sweating!!  I highly recommend this product or any of the Callanetics videos!",1375142400,12,287,4.816326530612245
5132506,5,B0085AEFJ4,"If nothing else, spend the $10 -12 on this DVD and learn the stomach exercises. I did the entire Callanetics program for years and while I never ""quite"" achieved the incredible legs Callan had in her heyday, I remember having a flat stomach, a tiny waist and a pefect hourglass torso. Now I have it again.  All I had to do was add these stomach exercises back into my rotation two (yes TWO!) times a week. Lots of methods claim to pull in the abdominals for that corset-like effect, but this is the ONLY one that really does it.",1373068800,84,528,4.333333333333333
5132507,5,B0085AEFJ4,"Great workout. I used to do it in the 90-ties and I came back to it now for I know it is truly effective. I don't mind an overdated format of this workout, for I know it works.

I recommend it to all who want see results and don't have too much time for the gym.",1368489600,13,262,3.6785714285714284

8525344,5,B0085AEFJ4,"I love this, Callanetics at it's best taught by Callan herself broken down in to three segments so you can benefit by doing Callanetics every day. Callan is so inspiring that you keep on doing it to achieve her spectacular figure and you feel great after. If you are a woman then you couldn't have picked a better exercise program. This will pull you up and in and you won't get a matronly figure.",1523145600,,397,4.378378378378378

8525346,5,B0085AEFJ4,I love Callan Pinckney and bought this DVD because I wanted organized sets of exercises to work into my own circuit training at home. I like variety. These deep muscle exercises really work. (my mom has been doing them since the 80s).,1502668800,2,234,4.595238095238095

8525348,5,B0085AEFJ4,I loved the original Callanetics but there were too many breaks from the workout.  It was nice to see the first time but I found myself constantly fast forwarding to the next exercise when I tried to do it on a regular basis.  This DVD has three 20 minute workouts. There is a little introduction that is easy to skip and the exercises go from one to the other quickly.  These exercises give quick results and I find myself doing this every day because it is easy to fit in 20 minutes.,1500681600,2,485,4.25

8525350,5,B0085AEFJ4,This is a quick way to get a workout in if you are short on time. It's easy to follow and I love this older version as much as I like the new versions of Callenetics. This program is very effective for my 50 year old joints and the best one I've found to protect my lower back. I especially like the intentional movements for each exercise. After all these years I still love Callan and her relaxing music.,1493078400,3,406,4.151898734177215
