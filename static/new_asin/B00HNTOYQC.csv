6192228,5,B00HNTOYQC,I don't say much. This is a great movie I have been waiting years for. Hollywood doesn't appreciate greatness if they think its not going to line their pockets. Peter Dinklage is the best. I'm ready to go LARP.,1392076800,3,210,4.410256410256411
6192229,4,B00HNTOYQC,"I can totally understand people not liking this movie, but I thought it was a hoot. It's very dorky at times, but endearingly so. I don't actually know any LARPers, so maybe they do talk in character like that, but I've for damned sure never done tabletop RPing where people used so many thees and hadsts. The plot might make minimal sense and lack much actual tension, but I enjoyed it like I'd enjoy an episode of Metalocalypse.",1392076800,3,430,4.5256410256410255

6192231,5,B00HNTOYQC,"Knights of badassdom - Me and 132 of my friends where able to get Tugg.com to bring the movie to Phoenix, Arizona February 4th at the AMC desertridge.  About 30 of us showed up in costume (garb) to watch this before it was released.  I will give a spoiler free review:

Basic Plot: LARPer's (Live Action Role Playing) conjure up a demon from Hell played by Margarita Levieva during a weekend get together for the LARP group.  Eric (Steve Zahn) and Hung (Peter Dinklage) are trying to cheer up their friend, room-mate and former D&D player Joe (Ryan Kwanten) who has just broken up with his girlfriend Beth.

The movie pokes fun at anyone who has ever done D&D, LARP, SCA, etc but coming from a person who does this for fun I can tell you it was a great fun movie.

There is Mild (think Evil Dead) gore in a few scenes, Drug use (Pot and Mushrooms), brief implied nudity (sideboob), mild violence and language.  If you liked roll models and the evil dead, have ever LARPed or had a friend who did and wanted you to join them for a weekend of ""fun"" this movie was made for you.",1391558400,81,1075,4.318407960199005
6192232,5,B00HNTOYQC,"I saw this during its limited theater release with a bunch of the folk who were extras in it. Much better than I was expecting considering the troubles it had during production! It certainly isn't a perfect movie, (where *did* that blood smear come from?), but is certainly funny. Expect it to hit a special place in the heart of every LARPer, D&D player, and metal music fan. I agree that it is destined to be a cult classic within these groups.",1391040000,11,446,4.451219512195122

6192236,5,B00HNTOYQC,"I don't even know what to say, I was completely floored by this cinematic masterpiece. If there was ever an official larping movie, a true poster child for active role play warfare, this would be it. A lesser-known movie starring some very good actors, such as Steve Zahn and Peter Dinklage, I found it a raucously good time throughout the film.

What at first begins as just another weekend for these friends, quickly turns to literal hell on earth when a shapeshifting demon is let loose onto the woods where their larping is taking place. They must band together (pun intended) to face death, terror, and awkward demon sex to save their friends and fellow larpers!",1518307200,,667,4.75

6192282,3,B00HNTOYQC,"I found this film during a relabeling project at my library. I read on the cover that it was about a fantasy game wizard unintentionally summoning a demon during a live action role player shindig in a forest. I was impressed by the idea. I was disturbed by its meh ratings on IMDB and Amazon. I watched it because Peter Dinklage and Summer Glau were in it.

I saw what I feared. The movie was a failure. I was going to say that it failed because the filmmakers couldn't figure out if they were making a comedy or a horror movie but that is not true. Consider: the demon at first looked like the ex-girlfriend of the lead, then like two men in the kind of costume the nerds would have made. They wanted it to be a comedy.

One problem. I didn't laugh out loud once and I didn't smile very much. Why? I was going to say that I don't like comedies with gore and real deaths. but that would be a lie. Last week I laughed at Laurel and Hardy repeatedly falling off a roof. I can and have laughed at the same thing happening with blood. I guess I didn't think it was funny enough. I suspect, first, that the director is simply incompetent at comedy, and, second, that the screenwriters got lazy. Yeah, I think the latter thought their basic idea was so funny that they would have to work very hard at jokes and stunts. Wrong.

What a waste, though, The actors were likable and as good as they could be under the circumstances and they made it watchable.",1466812800,,1447,4.254545454545455

Yet, in the end, there wasn't that much substance to it, and it wasn't as funny as it should have been. It's half-baked as a comedy, and as horror. Some people claim there was an original cut that was better- but for whatever reason we never ended up getting it. Oh well, can't always win.",1454544000,,387,4.464788732394366
6192292,1,B00HNTOYQC,"I had so many high hopes for this movie, but even the considerable acting skills of Peter Dinklage and Summer Glau couldn't save this disaster. Every character in this movie exists to portray some kind of flat stereotype, and as a result their characters never come to life or engender much sympathy.

In fairness, I'm not usually a fan of horror movies, and I understand that some people like the blatant gore that Knights of Badassdom displays. Personally, I found the level tacky and excessive. The special effects are cheaply, poorly done; I was left wondering if the producers had no money left for effects after they hired ""big name"" actors. But this movie's problems go far beyond cheap monster suits.

As someone who has done a considerable amount of Live Action Roleplaying games (LARPs), I felt this film fails in a number of ways to realistically portray the environment of a LARP site. (Spoiler alert for everything else I write after this point.) Real LARPers tend to be much better fighters than the movie portrays. Did I mention the fight choreography was horrible? I've seen small children fight more skillfully. LARPers also tend to have much less money to spend on their hobby than the movie's characters (that many people in plate mail on such a luxurious event site was pushing the bounds of credibility, and the computer system inside the non-player character ""dragon"" destroyed it completely). Also, most LARPs have sensible plans in place for if violence or medical emergencies do occur on site. While handling an actual demon is admittedly out of most people's area of experience, the event coordinator's complete incompetence shows him to be the sort of person who wouldn't know what to do if one of his LARPers got a paper cut. Again, this is one more blow to credibility. I was never really able to attain any sort of suspension of disbelief because I was too busy thinking ""yes, but that would never actually HAPPEN.""

It is clear that the writers had a bias against LARPers; the most relatable characters (played by Glau and Kwanten) don't even want to be there in the first place, and all other characters are buffoons who can't tell the difference between a game and reality. The character who takes LARPing the most seriously, Gunther, is literally shown to be mentally ill, to the point that he needs a caretaker present to ""babysit"" him at all times. Gunther is completely incapable of relating to the ""real world."" Everyone else (with the exceptions of Glau and Kwanten) acts like they are in need of some milder psychological help. The script finds ways to make anyone serious about LARP-ing look ridiculous; the running joke about one character's masturbatory habits (I won't go into detail) is just one example of the writers attempting to perpetuate harmful ""nerd"" stereotypes. What personal growth the protagonist and his love interest experience over the course of the film is expressed by them leaving the world of LARPing, never to return. The underlying message of this film:anyone who LARPs is psychologically immature at best, insane at worst, and all healthy people should avoid contact with LARPers. This message is not only inaccurate, it is downright harmful.

If anyone is interested in learning more about the stereotypes about LARPers, this article ( https://larpers.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/larp-stereotypes-in-defense-of-the-larpers/ ) and this one ( http://www.rpgresearch.com/blog/yet-another-example-of-inculcated-stigma-regarding-role-playing-gamers ) go into more detail. Despite the fact that ""Knights of Badassdom"" has set the bar for quality so low, I cannot recommend a better movie about LARPers - to the best of my knowledge, a good movie has yet to be made.",1454112000,,3724,5.150413223140496

And yes, that's the film's premise, for sure. Everything's cheesy, including quite a bit of the acting. The plot, the dialogue, you name it - it's like a bunch of gamers got drunk and said, ""Let's make a LARP horror movie! with demons! and 'this one time at LARP camp' jokes! and ... and... Summer Glau and Steve Zahn and Peter Dinklage!""

A lot of swearing, so if naughty words are not for you, then neither is this film. Some violence - some a bit more graphic than others. If you can get through your weekly showing of Game of Thrones, this is probably easy in comparison.

It's cheesy, there's definitely a bunch of LARP/MMORPG jokes, and there's a heavy hand with the horror.

6192302,5,B00HNTOYQC,"This movie is awesome!  If you are a gamer or know a gamer and can enjoy a movie that is not going to pose deep philosophical issues then this is a great movie for you.

It is in-line with movies like ""Unicorn City,"" ""the Last Lovecraft,"" and ""Dorkness Rising.""  If you saw and liked these films then again this film is for you.

If you despise gamers, geeks, and anything not on NPR then you will *hate* this movie.

Read on, but beware as spoilers follow.

First, your expectations have to be in the correct range.

This is not game of thrones level film direction and script quality.  This is an all-star cast in a movie about geeks doing geeky gamer things.  You can tell from the clear ad libs that many of these stars have been in gaming venues previously and liked it.

The jokes are bad, bad, bad, but they are *supposed to be*.

Nothing is sacred in this movie, and, while the jokes are discrete, many of the politically correct things in these current United States are poked at pretty shamelessly.

Second, don't fall in love with any particular character -- most of them are killed off by the middle of the film.  Just say'in.

Well done!

Sadly, the movie is not a very high budget film and it's pretty noticeable. But a few great actors make it better like Summer Glau and Peter Dinklage, plus I think it's awesome that real Larpers joined as the background cast and there were a few pretty good parts. I did start loosing some interest after a certain character's death and would have preferred he lived....In all, it's a movie you can just watch for fun and not have to look for some underlying meaning.",1437350400,,662,4.525

6192353,3,B00HNTOYQC,"KOB is basically a mash-up of 1987's The Gate and Role Models.  Great idea.  Poor writing.  It had an excellent (with a capital E) cast.  It simply failed to execute its unique premise and quickly became a well-performed disappointment.  Especially if you love fantasy/horror, role playing, D&D, LARPing, heavy metal, and the 80's--from which this movie was clearly birthed.  KOB missed its mark in so many ways.

All of the characters had such potential!  A giant maniac who looks like Billy Idol and lives ""in-game"" 24 hours a day.  A heavy metal musician trapped on a LARPing trip.  An ultra-wealthy geek who gets his hands on a demonic book of magic from the Renaissance--one co-produced by John Dee.  A spunky, sexy girl who tags along with her mentally-ill cousin to keep him safe on LARP trips, but who obviously enjoys it all.  A drug-addled, role playing fanatic little person dubbed ""Sir Hung"" whose combat training is impeccable.  LOL.  And the list goes on.

The dialogue was not sharp and comedic.  The characterization lacked, and back-stories for each character were nonexistent.  The effects were low-low-budget.  KOB missed out on presenting a bunch of facts and weird truths about role playing and its communities, from which it could have produced a series of well-informed ""inside"" jokes that the general audience would enjoy.  The characters were superficially exciting--we want to know more about this motley crew!  But all we get is their facades.  No depth.  No reason to care.

On the plus side, there were a few genuinely funny moments; and the actors try their damnedest to be silly and evoke hilarity from the poor writing they were given.  The Game Master especially.  Almost all of his lines are perfectly delivered, with odd sing-song embellishments and geeky quirks.  And he is infamous for something being ""stucketh together.""  When Steve Zahn's wizard utters/sings spells, he emulates a backwards playing record--a shout out to those ridiculous 1980's tales of demons in metal records, on MTV, etc.

KOB is worth watching when it becomes free on Prime.  If you are still curious, though, rent it ONLY if you are a big fan of role playing.  If you already pay for the Flix of Net, it is available there now.

6192372,5,B00HNTOYQC,"You have to see this movie. I saw it yesterday, which is early December 2014 and I got a real kick out of it. Now, I am older than the target age group for this film, but I'll tell you who I think that is. This movie is for the skateboarding, game playing, science fiction watching, Star Wars loving, man who refuses to grow up. It doesn't mean that because you own your own business, or run the IT department of a regional retailer or bank you can't watch it. You just need a really great 21st Century sense of humor and a love of quirky semi-horror stories with really funny dialogue dropped in, here and there.

Steve Zahn does a great job here, in typical hurly-burly, manic fashion. He is the same kind of guy that he played as the short-on-talent, big on music, white-guy-musician and composer in Treme, and the same near-nutcase from his long ago role in Saving Silverman.  You're going to be pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of names that you won't know, but they are all good. No one drops the ball in this one. Director Joe Lynch keeps things moving and gets great performances, dead on character from each actor.

It's a little zany but a great tour-de-force of a movie...both the movie itself...what it is....and how good it is.

6192404,4,B00HNTOYQC,"Sometimes you just want a movie that's a lot of fun, and that's what Knights of Badassdom is. It's not a realistic movie, it's not taking itself too seriously, the cast was obviously having a lot of fun while filming it and if you just want to sit down and watch a funny light horror movie, than you won't go wrong here.  Adding to the fun of this one is the sheer volume of actors from TV shows that had huge cult followings when they were on the air, who haven't been in much since.  It's fun going oh hey there's that guy from Community, or the girl from Terminator Chronicles.  Peter Dinklage is obviously marketed in the centre of the DVD cover as Game of Thrones is still on air, but there's a heap of stars from shows that were as popular at the time.  It's a low budget film but that sort of adds to the fun.

Basic premise of the movie follows Ryan Kwanten (True Blood) who plays Joe, a roommate of a couple of live action role players who remained social outcasts and bully victims into their adulthood.  Joe was part of the same social group when younger but his D & D childhood has been deliberately left behind to try and make it in a band.  However after a breakup and a bit of substance abuse he awakens in the back of his roommate's van wearing armour and finds himself in the car park of a big LARP convention out in the wilderness.  His friends think this is just what he needs.  He doesn't want to be there.  Unbeknownst to them all, a book of spells bought on E-bay is about to make change these role players world from fantasy to reality.

But we were appalled by the succubus in a prom dress ripping off a man's jaw and five minutes later ripping out a beating heart, in graphic detail and for no apparent reason other than to gross out the audience. In mythology a succubus was a beautiful female demon that seduces and sleeps with men. No ripping out of organs or eating flesh......

Too bad. We actually paid to rent this and feel both ripped of and decieved.

Seriously, just watch the trailers and that pretty much sums up the movie for you. There are a few gag lines here and there that are funny, but in general this movie utterly fails as a comedy. It only has some minor comedic value if you are a LARPer or understand LARPing, and you are in the mood for some light-hearted fun about it.

It also fails in terms of plot. It features an incredibly asinine, unimaginative, predictable and frankly boring plot that any average high school student could devise. The acting is so-so (except of course for Peter Dinklage). The special effects are awful. You almost feel like the production ran out of money at the end. The villain/monster at the end of the movie looks like a Halloween costume you'd buy at Walmart. It looks and feels like an amateur production.

6192451,2,B00HNTOYQC,"You can see the appeal of a film like ""Knights of Badassdom"" to a crowdsourcing geek audience.  It's got heavy metal, role-playing games, and live action role-playing games.  Add in Peter Dinklage as a player named Hung, an ""Evil Dead"" homage, and gratuitous shots of Summer Glau's rear-end in fishnet stockings and you've pretty much got a hit on your hands. Or you should anyway.  Unfortunately, ""Knights of Baddassdom"" looks like it was filmed in a day and due to sloppy editing, never really rises above a hodgepodge of geek bait.

Joe (Ryan Kwanten), a heavy metal rock singer who has a decent job as a mechanic, gets dropped by his hottie girlfriend who is more interested in a man with career aspirations. I'd like to point out that at no point in the film is being a mechanic considered a viable career, one of the insidious aspects of a film like ""Kings of Badassdom"" - apparently being a mechanic means you do nothing all day but goof off.

Downtrodden, Joe is bolstered by his two friends, the aforementioned Hung and Eric (Steve Zahn). And by ""bolstered"" I mean they roofie him with a combination of drugs and booze, dress him up in armor, and drop him off at a Live Action Role-Playing game (LARP).

One thing ""Knights of Baddassdom"" gets right is how LARPs actually work.  It takes great glee in making fun of the supposed epic nature of the LARP conflicts, despite the fact that they're essentially taking place in a park and a parking lot, respectively.  Unlike other movies about LARPs, ""Knights of Badassdom"" makes it a point of showing that referees are an important part of the game.  Ronnie (Jimmi Simpson) is an egomaniac, invoking shades of ""Zero Charisma,"" who is endlessly mocked for being caught masturbating to the picture of a succubus from the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual.  This is a thing - original D&D books frequently showed women's breasts in art, and it was often the first exposure young boys had to nudity (ah, the days before the Internet).

These two plot points -- lusting after a fictional monster and breaking up with an awful girlfriend - come to a head when Eric uses a real mystical book written in Enochian to accidentally summon a succubus that takes the shape of Joe's girlfriend. Hilarity ensues.

The succubus goes around having sex with people (for some reason, this always happens off screen, despite the frequent use of swear words, drugs, and alcohol abuse) and then killing them by tearing out their hearts and eating it. Our heroes are called on to become true heroes by using actual weapons (totally not allowed in a LARP) to defeat her.

Of course, things get worse before they get better.  The problem is they get unbelievably bad when the succubus turns into a huge demon who proceeds to slaughter half of the LARPers. It's difficult to imagine that anyone could have a happy ending after that, but ""Knights of Baddassdom"" hopes you don't notice, and culminates with a rock battle that proves bards really are the most important member of the party.

It's the execution that suffers.  The rock music isn't that great. The demon looks like a guy in a monster suit, which is a real problem when the LARPers role-playing monsters are actually guys in monster suits.  The demon has a big, vaginal-like opening that looks like it was probably supposed to do something in the movie, but never does.  It's all very Freudian and not particularly rewarding.

The other problem is the women in this film. There are just two: Summer Glau, who only joined to keep an eye on her mentally ill cousin (and frequently dodges the same branch as she runs through a forest, a scene used twice in the film) and Joe's former girlfriend, in the form of a succubus on the night of their prom.  The phrase ""bitch"" is used frequently, and despite the bevy of female LARPers in the background, not one of them has anything to do besides die. The one other female who has a speaking part cheats on her boyfriend after having a threesome and then promptly makes out with the succubus in the middle of the woods, despite the fact that she's spattered with gore.  This film doesn't just fail the Bechdel test, it didn't wake up on time to even take it.

""Knights of Badassdom"" has a pro-gaming message that's undermined by its attempt to create stereotypes of characters: the slacker/rocker who is a lot more successful at life than the film gives him credit for, the athletic hottie who has almost nothing to do besides be the future girlfriend, and the ""bitch"" who has a philosophy that LARPing is a waste of time -- a theme the film subtly endorses.  According to ""Knights of Baddassdom,"" the only people who are good at a LARP and deserve a happy ending are the two people who didn't want to be a part of it in the first place.",1407456000,,4776,4.6393831553973905

Joe (Ryan Kwanten) becomes despondent after his girlfriend breaks up with him so his friends Hung (Peter Dinklage) and Eric (Steve Zahn) take him to a medieval role playing camp where he meets Gwen (Summer Glau) and her cousin Gunther (Brett Gipson). Joe is reluctant at first to get into the festivities, but he comes around in the end. Then something goes horribly awry when Eric unknowingly uses black magic to summon a demon who looks like Joes ex-girlfriend. She goes on a murderous path of destruction and it seems like there is no way to defeat her. Should they run to the hills or should Joe and his teammates band together to stop her before she begins killing the rest of their fellow gamers?

Character Development

There is virtually no character development here. Everyone seemed unaffected by what happened to them and just carries on. Other than Joe getting over his girlfriend nothing really happens. This is not a film of personal growth.

Acting

The comic timing seemed to be in sync for the most part. The lead actors did a fine job with what material they were given. Because everything was played for laughs none of the scenes where taken seriously, even when characters were faced with the threat of death. Under these circumstances this was not the realm to test anyones acting skills. Yet I don't believe I have ever seen Steve Zahn in a serious acting role, though he always seems at home playing the comedic part.

Overview

Despite what appears to be a low budget production that seems to be filmed over a short period of time this movie was very entertaining for the most part. For its comical aspirations don't fall flat. It wasn't a laugh out loud funny, but I believe there was a great amount of humor there even though the antics were a bit sophomoric, yet no worse than other comedies of the recent past. I think the story reached a good mix of horror and lighthearted humor. What the producers set out to do looks like it has been accomplished.",1406419200,2,1985,4.638176638176638

6192481,3,B00HNTOYQC,"Take a cast that includes Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones), Ryan Kwanten (True Blood), Summer Glau (Firefly, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles), and Steve Zahnput then in a film about Live Action Role-Players who summon a real demon by mistake and its sure to be a hit, right?  Well not so muchDespite a surefire cast and fun idea, Knights of Badassdom fails to live up to its promise.

Kwanten plays Joe, a slacker mechanic and musician wannabe who has just been dumped by his girlfriend.  He turns to his buddies Hung (Dinklage) and Eric (Zahn) for support.  His buddies live in Hungs suburban castle which he built after getting a large inheritance.  Hung and Eric spend their days engaging in complex LARPing sessions complete with costumes and real medieval weapons.  To try to cheer their buddy up, Hung and Eric get Joe wasted and kidnap him to a major LARP game in a nearby state park.

There they meet up with dozens of other players including the beautiful Gwen (Glau).  Eric uses an old book of spells he bought on eBay which, unknown to him, belonged to a 16th century sorcerer who tried to use the incantations to summon angels but instead summoned demons.  Eric conjures up a succubus in the form of Joes former girlfriend who goes on a bloody rampage, killing the gamers.  The friends have to survive long enough to send the demon back to Hell.

Knights of Badassdom starts off hitting some high notes and the mix of Kwanten, Dinklage, and Zahn makes for several hilarious scenes early on with jokes generally aimed at stereotypical nerdy game players.  Predictble but funny.  Kwanten varies little from his character of Jason Stackhouse playing Joe as simple but honest.  Dinklage and Zahn throw themselves into their characters as gung-ho role-players who prefer fantasy to real life.

One the demon is suffered the film loses most of its humorous charm and becomes almost a straight horror film the rest of the way.  Director Joe Lynch gives the demon no personality whatsoever, missing a chance to keep the film on its light-hearted parody trail.  Lynch does make the best of an epic battle between two rival factions of LARPers but its too little too late.  Dinklage, the most fun member of the cast is killed off far too early and Glau does little more than stand around looking hotwhich she does quite well, however.

Okay -- first, I didn't quite expect the horror element to be quite so pervasive as I figured it was just a comedy/horror spoof, so was a bit taken aback at first at the gore. Still, it wasn't overly frequent so I managed to tolerate it. Next, the story line was very original which made it all the more entertaining. I'm a little fatigued over stories that are continually rehashed from blockbusters. Third, the acting was great. Peter Dinklage was especially entertaining to watch. The only thing I could have done without was -- of course -- the overuse of the work f**k. Why is it that writers today feel that without overuse of this word, their story would fall flat. In my humble opinion, this story would have stood strong without using the word at all. I would have been happy just having it substituted occasionally with other swear words.

6192486,2,B00HNTOYQC,"""Knights of Badassdom"" is an ultra-lame parody aimed at all those grown men (and a few women) who regularly dress up like rejects from ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""Game of Thrones,"" then venture out to the forest to wield swords and cast spells on one another.  However, the boys get more than they bargained for when some actual, honest-to-God demonic creatures decide to crash the festivities, leaving mayhem and destruction in in their wake and forcing the LARPers to put into practice what they`ve been only playacting at all this time.

The presence of Ryan Kwanten (""True Blood""), Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones""), and Steve Zahn (""Treme"") in the cast suggests that the actors got bored one summer just hanging around while their respective series were on hiatus, and this is what they came up with to fill the void. Yet, it really isn't their fault that the movie looks as if it were filmed in someone's - admittedly expansive - backyard. I prefer, instead, to lay a large chunk of the blame on Kevin Dreyfuss and Matt Wall for coming up with the dismal script and director Joe Lynch for putting it before the cameras.

6192517,1,B00HNTOYQC,"Knights of Badassdom was a movie that found itself stuck at a crossroads, trying to decide whether to be a horror/gore movie or a dark comedy and failed at both.

A movie with Steve Zahn, Peter Dinklage and Dany Puti made me stoked to see this movie. Add to that the loooong wait for the DVD release and you can imagine my anticipation.

The beginning is very formulaic: Joe (Ryan Kwanten) gets dumped by his girlfriend and and unable to see their friend down in the dumps, Eric and Hung (Zahn and Dinklage) conspire to take Joe to a LARP (Live Action Role Play) in order to help him forget about his girlfriend and have some fun. I didn't have a problem with this as it's all the mcguffin that these kinds of ""stoner"" movies need.

So after watching Kwanten's character do several bong hits and a 1/5th of whiskey/scotch I waited for the hilariousness to ensue...and waited...aaand...waited.

There were very few jokes. It was mainly the characters going from point A to point B and explaining what a LARP was. Eric then accidentally summons a succubus from Hell and the characters continue to go from point A to point B but now the camera cuts away every so often to show some nameless peripheral character getting murdered.

The acting is...very odd. In the beginning the characters feel as though they start to make jokes and then the scene ends or the topic gets changed. It's like watching a car trying to turn over in winter but just...can't...quite...make it.

Near the middle the dialogue is almost non-existent as it's been replaced with single lines like, ""What are we gonna do?"" or heavy metal music used to point out ""cool"" things or characters preparing for battle. The special effects are atrocious. The monster looks like something out of Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, which WOULD have been funny if the movie had done anything to cultivate that kind of atmosphere.

In the end, terrible effects, poor writing, pacing, dialogue and zero humor, this movie is to cinema what Duke Nukem Forever was to gaming. Late, while still feeling rushed, poorly executed, over-hyped, and not at all worth the wait.",1402531200,6,2117,4.752043596730245

I'm a fan of fantasy and thought this would be an enjoyable wink-wink comedy, filled with little nods to the genre. After watching the movie, I can't tell what the filmmakers knew less about: LARP or filmmaking. It's an insultingly bad script, in both content and structure. This plays out like one of those really hokey straight to video horror movies from the 80s, only not nearly as charming, despite the far superior cast. In truth, I cannot fathom why any of the actors are in this. I can only imagine they thought it would turn out very, very differently. This is not a fun movie, not even bad fun.

If you think of it as a cheesy, one liner, trope loving piece of low budget hilarity poking fun at everything you are in for a great time. My friends and I are tabletop players, some of them are LARPers (live action roleplayers) and we were all vastly amused and going 'oh, oh we know these people!

The premise is fun.  The acting is better and the overall result is a Night in Badassdom.  It was just plain sit around and drink with your gamer friends fun.  All of the cast deliver in their roles.

Peter Dinklage & Summer Glau = Worth Seeing.

As much as I dearly love characters that they have played in other roles...neither one of them bleed over into these.

So good!",1399248000,,476,4.583333333333333

The subject matter and many references are definitely not for kids (or at least not ones who are as young on the outside as they are on the inside), but the plot is hilarious and Summer Glau and Peter Dinklage are both awesome in their roles.  Oh, and the music is pretty cool too-- heavy metal that took me back to the days of my head-banging, D&D-playing youth.  I saw it in the theater and could not wait to get my hands on a copy.

Gotta love it Peter Dinkage, Steve Zahn Summer Glau, Ryan Kwanton and a title like the ""Knights of Badassdom"" what can go wrong?

6192634,2,B00HNTOYQC,I was expecting to see more of Dinklage. He was the best character in the movie. Far more interesting than the jilted boyfriend.  The LARPing jokes were very good.  The violence was just over the top and made the movie come across as a cheap rip off of the first Evil Dead series.  The climax of the movie was just really dumb and didn't make any sense.

Enthusiasts of archaic combat techniques will also find their succor in this bloody romp, which at times feels like a classic supernatural slasher movie. The film is rich with running jokes that aren't as funny as the creators wanted them to be, and fans of Peter Jackson's early work will find a lot of foam-rubber meat to sink their teeth into, especially in the final act. If you're always listening to Dragonforce, you've invested money in four of each shock land, you've spent more than one weekend out in the woods whacking your friends with padded polearms, or you're just a big fan of Summer Glau, you'll have fun with Knights of Badassdom.

There was a lot more ""cheesy horror"" to this than ""cheesy fantasy"", and appartently that's not what I'm into. I guess I should have read the reviews first.

It didn't even play up the gore that much, so it's not even a bad gore movie.

Overall it was fun and the ending awesome. But overall they missed the mark.

The larpers in a lot of scenes badly overdid the acting including the DM who was wwwaaayyy overdone to the point of obnoxious, Second the antagonistic paintballers were stupid side characters that needed to just not happen. Larps happen all the time paintballers don't show up- non required distraction.

While I still found it entertaining and loved the perfect mix of humor and gore, you could tell it was lacking heart in the editing and its missing something. That something is Joe Lynch's passion.

It starts out not weak, but you are not sure how it is going to draw you in. Then suddenly you are fully in.  I loved how their was a clear difference between the LARP battles and the real ones. When it came down to real fighting no one was ""amazing"" because of their experience, they were all scared whitless. As anyone would be. Yes the demons final form looked like it was out of TMNT 2, but it had a sort of charm because of that.

The closing credit were a little weak, but the music tie in (which yes I saw coming) was amazing. Clearly this whole movie is a love song to its fans. I will absolutely watch this again.",1397347200,,771,4.099337748344371

Sadly everything amusing in the movie was in the trailer. Leaving a bloody, gory mess fest that left me totally disappointed. I thought with the cast that it had, that it would have to be pretty good. But it wasn't. It was choppy, it felt like 2 different movies spliced into one. I rather liked the first 1/2 but my interest dwindled as it got into the bloody slasher horror flick 1/2 of the movie.

I didn't hate it since the stuff that was funny in the trailer was funny in the movie. But I didn't exactly like it either. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1396828800,,799,4.148387096774194

If you don't LARp or play D&D or never had an interest in role play, then this movie probably is not for you. There are a lot of references, particularly with the comedy, that the average movie goer would just not catch onto. But as a LARPer, I found it hysterical. I doubt there is a LARPER out there who engaged in such rituals who didn't wonder now and then what would happen if you accidentally unleashed such a thing. In any case, I would have given it 5 stars, but like many others I think they should have let the directors cut be released as this version felt a little unpolished and a bit scattered. It just seemed a bit disconnected and like it was missing things.

6192736,4,B00HNTOYQC,"When I heard there was an indie movie with Peter Dinklage and Steve Zahn about LARPers that accidentally summon a demon from hell (succubus) and have to actually battle a monster I was pretty excited. I pre-ordered the movie and watched it as soon as I could on April 1st when I received it. Knights of Badassdom was fun and enjoyable, however, I was expecting more and was disappointed in the execution of the film. The movie itself has some fairly genuine acting and does not make people that LARP or roleplay the butt of any easy jokes. While I am not personally interested in those subjects I appreciate the refrain from grasping at easy laughs by the caricaturization of what may be considered fringe or nerd culture. The film has some funny dialogue and good moments and then turns from a comedy into horror about halfway through. The gore and dark humor hint at an Evil Dead 2 inspiration but fails to pull it off (if that truly was it's intent to mix horror and dark comedy). I will admit it was refreshing to see actual fake blood and gore with an 8 foot demonic puppet suit with only minimal CGI instead of the usual 100% CGI effects one commonly sees in low budget and independent films today. I can definitely see this becoming a cult classic, I just felt there were too many moments where the writing or possibly direction failed to capitalize on humor or character building. The actors and effects were excellent, the film just could have been better.

I chose 4 stars because I like the film and that's what the rating system states. I've seen quite a few 2 star reviews where the reviewer states the film was decent but somewhat disappointing. According to Amazon's rating system, 2 stars is a did not like... This isn't the same as a traditional movie review because it isn't a professional critique of art. It is a consumer review of a product on a retail site. Did I like the product and find its quality acceptable? Yes, I did. Do I think the movie could have been better or more funny? Certainly, however, that is my opinion and may or may not represent your tastes or expectations.",1396483200,2,2103,4.53421052631579
6192737,4,B00HNTOYQC,"Fun comedy/horror tells the tale of slacker mechanic Joe (Ryan Kwanten), whose beautiful girlfriend Beth (Margarita Levieva) dumps him after tiring of his unambitious ways. To cheer him up, his friends Eric (Steve Zahn) and Hung (Peter Dinklage) take him, reluctantly, to a live action fantasy role play game for the weekend that they attend regularly. There Eric performs a 'spell' to activate Joe's status as a player but, uses an old spell book he bought on E-Bay instead of the regulation spells that are part of the game. Unknown to any of them, the book is real and it's spells can summon actual demons and thus Eric has unwittingly summons a succubus in the guise of Beth (also Margarita Levieva) who begins to literally eat any fantasy role player who crosses her sexy/hungry path. Once this grave error is discovered, it's up to the three friends and the sexy Gwen (Summer Glau) to find and destroy this very real monster and halt the bloody body count that is spiraling out of control. As directed by Joe Lynch (the fun and gruesome Wrong Turn 2) Knights Of Badassdom is a fun and, at times, delightfully blood-soaked flick that has a lot of fun with not only the horror conventions but, the fantasy role play world as well. The clever script by Kevin Dreyfuss and Matt Wall never makes fun of the subjects it covers but, playfully pokes them in the ribs while also being it's own horror with generous doses of laughs. And there is a lot of fun to be had here and it's only in it's finale where it sadly loses it'd grip a bit. After all we've been through with the lovable cast of eccentric characters, we kind of expected something with a bit more impact or at least a lot funnier. It's amusing but, there are far better bits throughout and the ending obviously should have been the best bit of all and it's not. The cast all have a good time playing their oddball characters such as Zahn's would-be sorcerer and Dinklage's stoner who backup Kwanten's more down to earth Joe. The ladies are enchanting as well with Glau being a strong and beautiful 'pretend' warrior woman and Levieva giving vampy life to both bitchy girlfriend and seductive monster. Nice to see Adventureland's ""Lisa P"" in a role she can sink her teeth into...literally! The whole cast seems to have a really good chemistry and work very well together and it helps make the relationships in the film more believable and thus more entertaining. The script would not have worked so well if the cast didn't make the characters so much fun to watch and they do. The FX are a little mixed. The visuals are satisfactory digital FX but, not great. The gore FX, however, are top notch and not only are well executed but, very plentiful. Overall I had a good time with Knights of Badassdom, I laughed quite a lot, but, just wish they had come up with a climatic confrontation that was worthy of all the fun that preceded it. Again, it's not a bad ending, it just seemed weak after some of the consistent cleverness that came before it. Overall, I would still very much recommend this fun little flick. I had a really good time and the ending certainly doesn't ruin a delightfully breezy and gory comedy/horror. Just be a little forgiving for the few times it stumbles as, more often then not, Badassdom takes it's story and gleefully runs with it. Also stars Community's Dani Pudi as one of the LARP players named Lando who dresses oddly similar to a certain Star Wars character. Fun flick that would make a nice paring with Tucker & Dale vs. Evil for an entertaining horror/comedy film fest.",1396396800,,3563,4.60377358490566

Unfortunately, wannabe wizard Eric casts a resurrection spell from a book he got from the internet and summons a deadly succubus onto the field of battle. Isnt that always the way?

Id been looking forward to Knights of Badassdom since I first heard about it in 2012, so I was thrilled when the movie finally found a distributor. Unfortunately, the movie didn't quite live up to my anticipation. Its an enjoyable 1.5 hours, but it just didn't make me laugh enough for a great comedy or squirm enough for a horror.

The cast is awesome, made up of actors (Ryan Kwanten, Summer Glau, Steve Zahn, Jimmi Simpson) I could actually see as true geeks. And the movie has fun with, but never makes fun of, the LARP community. I would have liked to see more of a story with the LARPers versus the redneck paintballers, who are just LARPers of another sort.

The basic premise, that LAPRers end up accidentally summoning a demon to the world, who then begins eating LARPers was enough to interest me, but the cast is actually really good, and does a great job of not taking themselves seriously while still really pushing forward the overall mood of the story.

It has been well documented on the interwebs that this film has been plagued with production woes, all the ideas are solid. A larping doofus trying to help his friend get over a previous breakup takes things one step too far in his fantasy unleashing a demon onto the earth by casting a spell from an ominous book he bought off ebay...which just happens to be the only existing copy, penned by someone to pay tribute to angels, but summons evil yada yada yada....they set it up not unlike evil dead 2 with a little bit of back story. The actors are there, the humor is there, but it's lacking something...maybe timing? As in 90 percent of these films you need to have some suspension of disbelief as to how characters know things to move the plot forward, but some of the exposition comes out of left field, making the characters at times feeling like cheap cardboard background fodder in which they are left to burn in dragonfire and what not and things.

6192856,4,B00HNTOYQC,"I have literally been waiting a few years for ""Knights of Badassdom."" Initially shot in 2010, it was stuck in post-production hell for a long, long time.

So it was something of a relief when it finally came out, and it turned out to be pretty much what I expected -- a wacky, gory movie about larpers who accidentally summon a real-life demon. That's... basically the entire plot. Expect buckets of blood, some goofy demon suits, and a bunch of guys in Ye Olde Medieval Costumes causing mayhem -- it's not great art, but it is fun.

Joe (Ryan Kwanten) is down in the dumps when his girlfriend dumps him for not being ""successful"" enough. So his buddies Hung (Peter Dinklage) and Eric (Steve Zahn) decide to drag him to the Battle of Evermore that weekend, even though he knows more about doom metal than larping. As they prepare for the epic larp battle the next day, the gang decides to use an old book for a pretend wizard ritual.

Here's the problem: the book once belonged to the occultist John Dee, and it contains actual spells... which means the group has summoned a succubus demon from hell. As the demon tears a bloody swathe through the larp community, the doughty little group must find a way to banish it back to the hellish abyss... which is harder than it sounds, especially when you can't actually read the spells.

""Knights of Badassdom"" is a movie for the teenage dork in all of us... which is to say it has bongs, metal music and lots of guys in armor whacking each other with foam swords. While it's aware of how silly larping can be, there's an affectionate awareness that we should do whatever hobbies make us happy. Unless you're a redneck who likes to shoot larpers with paintball guns -- then you're just an a-hole.

Director Joe Lynch also produces a greyhound of a movie, loping quickly from Joe's heartbreak to his roomies dragging him off to Evermore. The plot slows down once they actually get there, but the horrible deaths (usually by torn-out heart) keep things entertaining. And of course, larp-related comedy, from the pseudo-medievalese (Subtitle: ""Ed's frickin' wife is making him clean the garage this weekend"") to the guys in fairy costumes.

But once the Knights find out that they actually summoned a demon, the movie revs itself back up for the bloody, fiery, frenetic finale, which climaxes on one of the most awesome battles I have ever seen in a comedy. There's an animatronic dragon, lots of weapons, a completely delusional guy, and Peter Dinklage sweeping around a sword in slow-motion to the sound of doom metal. It does not get better than that.

It's also one of those movies where you can really tell that the actors were having fun -- Dinklage effortlessly steals every scene he's in, and left me wishing that he had many, many more. Zahn and Jimmi Simpson leap wholeheartedly into their roles as devoted nerds, and Kwanten is a good everyman hero who is involved in all this whether he likes it or not. Summer Glau seems a bit superfluous, though -- I was never entirely sure why she was there, except that the story needed a girl/love interest.

This is both a love letter to and a gentle parody of larping -- lots of guts and gore, pseudo-medievalese and guys dressed as pixies.",1394236800,,3234,4.641608391608392

Steve Zahn is a big asset to this movie, and Peter Dinklage is great, also.  This is a quirky story about a Larping event gone astray.  The wizard summons a demon form Hell in the middle of the event, and the war now becomes real as everyone must scramble to survive amid the chaos created by the demon.  If you are into role playing it's a must see, and if you are not, watch it anyway to see what role playing is all about.",1393891200,,545,4.018518518518518

And...  he ""sings"" the monster to death off the hood of a truck?  At that point, the corny factor got a little too much.  If I could have given this 2.5 stars, I would have.

6192883,2,B00HNTOYQC,"I am not sure if it was the long time between the first trailer and the release date, but I think I over hyped this movie in my mind. The trailer has every memorable scene from this movie in it. The only reason I even gave it two stars was the fact that the amazing cast pulled off decent performances and the fact that it was filmed locally. I might have forgive the weak script if the special effects had not been so horrible. My first comment was that the special effects were as bad as an episode of the Power Rangers. I just watched a clip of the Power Rangers on YouTube and realize the effects might even be better on that show.

I realize they had problems finding a company to release the movie and that might have had a part to do with the special effects not looking even close to complete. It was bad enough though that my willful suspension of disbelief would not kick in. Did I mention the script was awful too?",1393804800,,925,4.196629213483146
6192884,5,B00HNTOYQC,"With a name like ""Knights of Badassdom"" you can't expect an artistic masterpiece.  With a name like ""Knights of Badassdom"" you can expect a ton of fun.  That is what this movie delivers.  This is a fun film, that harnesses many top talent actors to create a very fun movie.

Also, don't be scared of the ""horror"" aspect.  I really dislike horror movies, and this doesn't fit in that style of movie.  It makes fun of LARPing, but in a more light-hearted way.  It also pays homage to it on the flip side.

I picked this movie up streaming the first weekend it was out.  It was well worth it, and I highly recommend watching this.  This is definitely a Monte Python type movie where watching with friends increases the enjoyment greatly!",1393804800,,734,4.492424242424242

6192886,3,B00HNTOYQC,"I'd read about the troubles with this film for a few years (sat on the shelf, the director got fired, and it was edited by the studio). The oddly-paced editing hints at a much smarter, ""out-there"" film made by those who ""get"" LARP-ing that was cut down into a more easily-digestible horror-comedy. The finale seems to retain the original spirit, as do a few other parts, but the rest of the film just feels... odd.

6192887,4,B00HNTOYQC,"Think ""Jennifer's Body"" meets ""Evil Dead.""  It isn't so much funny as amusing.  The creature effects are poor.  But, overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  The cast was amazing.  Every nerd's heart throb Summer Glau along with the super amazing Peter Dinklage took the cast over the top for me along with the mains Steve Zahn and Ryan Kwanten.  I also enjoyed Danny Pudi and some of the other actors who played smaller parts.  The movie doesn't stick in any particular genre, but is more like a ""Dale and Tucker vs Evil"" mish mash.  Contrary to other reviewers I don't think it made fun of LARPers.  In fact, I was looking into the LARPing scene locally after watching it to check it out.  Doubt I will ever LARP (wife and small kid keep me busy) but it looks like fun.  All in all, I recommend the movie for those it seems interesting to.  The only thing I'm sad about is that they didn't somehow get Nathan Fillion in some small part as the cherry on top of the desert of this movie.  He would have been great as one of the kings :-) and this type of movie seems right up his alley (if you never saw ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Slong Blog"" then definitely give it a look see.)",1393718400,,1170,4.3119266055045875
6192888,3,B00HNTOYQC,"I was really looking forward to this movie it has the best actors for this kind of movie and an awesome premise. The problem here lies in the writing and execution. The movie had a bit of ADD bringing up points like the main characters friend being an accidental millionaire. How why? Also the practical and special effects were lackluster at best and this is coming from someone who loves Kamen Rider. So many muddle areas of this film and wasted actors Brain Posien say all of two words really. Also killing off two very interesting actors before they even really did anything. My other issue is with Peter Dinklages role he is an awesome actor very smart, well spoken, and has an amazing presence. I felt the character he played was not within the actors standards and his skills were under used by this seemingly less then there character. While I don't think this movie is terrible you can easily run through it and get some amusement the ending scene is pretty cool but it does not make up for the rest of the movie. Over all it wasn't worth 5.99 to rent and I was disappointed. This movie had so much potential if it  just had a better writer and a bigger budget. Can we get Joss Wheadon in on this for a write and redo come on Summer give him a call maybe bring in the guys who did leprechaun and other fun horrors out there.

Well there goes my ADD that's all I have to say.

""Knights of Badassdom"" is such a wreck that I felt terrible Peter Dinklage, Danny Pudi, Jimmi Simpson, and Michael Gladis got dragged into such humorless slop. Whatever favors they owed, I hope they're paid in full now.

However, once I saw the poster for knights of badassdom appear again on the Amazon newest movies, I had to check it out because it reminded me of ""Your Highness"" the movie with Danny McBride except this Knights of Badassdom movie is all about LARP which stands for Live Action Role Playing!

Anyways, this movie is absolutely HILARIOUS and FUN to watch as long as you have an open mind.  If you are the type of movie watcher that enjoys those big budget movies like Transformers or Fast n Furious or whatever, then you might want to avoid this because you are better off watching Hangover 1-3 or whatever it is that ""Bros"" or douchebags watch these days.

Plus, if you are waiting for Games of Thrones Season 4 which is a few months away, then Knights of Badassdom is the perfect movie to watch.  Hell, even Peter Dinklage is in this movie as well and he is f'n hilarious as well as AWESOME! When you get right down to it, this movie is a blast to watch with friends and especially if you a LARPer as well! Do NOT let the negative nancy reviews hold you back from watching this fun yet funny film because most of the time the negative reviews are actually reviewed by people who watch way too many big budget hollywood movies.  Just give this movie a rental, grab a few friends on a friday or weekend night and watch Knights of Badassdom! This is one of the few movies that I really enjoy when renting movies from Amazon because it can be hard to find a good movie that is worth renting for $3.99 and if this movie costed $6.99 to rent, then I would of happily paid for it since the makers of this film deserved it! You will not find many movies that deals with LARP and comedy at the same time but Knights of Badassdom will deliver that for you and you're friends!",1393372800,,1871,4.301136363636363
6192910,2,B00HNTOYQC,"I waited with some anticipation for this movie to come out, it was played up quite a bit online.  And, I will admit, I played D&D back into day.  I should have taken a clue from delay after delay.  Ultimately, I think it was delayed because the producers realized that no one should have to suffer this much needlessly.

And with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, and that Zahn guy, how could it go wrong?  F me, I really need to stop asking questions like that.

I guess if we were to look at movies like Cabin in the Woods, or Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, we would see horror comedy done well.  As I recall, they might show the dude flying into the woodchipper, but its from a side view, where you don't see his spleen getting ripped out.  Not this movie.  That spleen gets ripped out and munched on in graphic detail.  Tough to find a chuckle, unless you're Hannibal Lecter.  Graphic evisceration just lacks humor.

And the special effects.  I think the effort to bring back Claymation in this movie was heartfelt, but poorly done.  I thought the Claymation in the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans was much better (before anyone throws a hissy fit, I do know that it wasn't Claymation, Claymation would have been better than this.  The playdoh monsters I made fight my star wars action figures 30 years ago would have been better).

The end of the movie.  They just cobbled that together in the last ten minutes.  The 'hero' of the movie sings some atonal gloom metal at the apocalyptic demon beast, thereby killing it.  God knows , it nearly did me in too.

 I am reminded of the following passage from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, 'During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem ""Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning"" four of his audience members died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council, survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been ""disappointed"" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization, leaped straight up through his neck and throttled his brain.

If only we could all be so lucky.

Anyone who likes live action role play games buy this on dvd or from amazon you won't be dissapointed unless your type of person who acts like prffosenial film critic who analyzes every little detail in movies takes joy out of movies to be made for entertainment puorpse use only then you will be dissapointed just warning anyone if you expect high expectations from this movie",1392854400,,1152,4.459715639810427

If you love RPG or LARP it is a must see. If you don't do either of the previously mentioned you might have a bit of difficulty understanding the movie and it's humor.

Update: Watched a second time -
So I was thinking about this and wondering if my review was skewed because of a couple things.  First, I was a little drunk.  Not falling down drunk, but I would not be able to drive a car.  Second, I watched this with a group of friends.  These two combined made me wonder if the booze and my friends laughing made me laugh more.  Well, in an effort to be thorough, I watched it again last night.  Just me, winding down after work, stone sober.  And you know what, still funny!

I fully admit that there are numerous random plots points that were not explained that might have made the movie flow better.  But that could have also led to the movie being too long and slowing down too much.  But here is what made the movie awesome, to me:
1.  Danni Pudi - Since I really like the show Community, this was a instant win.
2.  Summer Glau - what can I say, she has such a sexy ""nerd girl"" look and when she smirks = awesome.
3.  Peter Dinklage - I liked the Station Agent, but really I think GOT has made him that much more awesome.  He puts the Imp in Pimp and is still awesome and funny in this movie!  And without being too ""spoilery"", his final battle scene was just epic!
4.  The music - Really the soundtrack overall is ok, but what sold the movie was the ""final battle scene"" and how the song plays into it.  Just trust me, it makes no sense at all, but it is awesome nonetheless!
5.  The other actors all did well, but the 3 I called out really made the movie.  The Stackhouse guy from True Blood and Steve Zahn were funny/cool as well, but the first 3 sold it for me.",1392595200,32,1718,4.114457831325301

Knights of Badassdom, has it's narrative issues, and wastes a few stellar actors on meddling and C level characters, however even with its flaws this film has become, for me, a definite instant classic.  If you are a fan of nerd culture and D&D, and want to see a fun and insane LARP comedy, this is the film for you.

The movie was enjoyable, but unless you're filthy rich, it will not be worth the price. I recommend waiting for the price to drop. It will drop pretty rapidly I bet. It just doesn't stand up to other lower budget genre pieces like The Gamers or Unicorn City.

Review with some spoilage:

Read the label. It says ""and"" Peter Dinklage. He's not the star. He's the best part of the movie, perhaps, but you'll spend most of your time looking at Steve Zahn and that other guy. Same for Summer Glau. If you're thinking you'll buy it just so you can watch her dressed up in LARP gear, stare at Steve Zahn on the cover until the feeling goes away. Then go watch Firefly again or something. Sure, she's hot in her getup. But if you're reading this, you've got the internet. You can find something. As for the movie, it's very predictable. This isn't necessarily bad. But the first half of this film is funny and will make the gamers laugh. The second half falls flat. You will be disappointed if you've watched it and have a twenty dollar blu ray left over. If you've rented or streamed, you'll probably feel ok.",1392595200,,1124,4.4731707317073175

6192949,3,B00HNTOYQC,"This is a dumb movie.

That is NOT a strike against it. Heck, the movie WANTS to be dumb. Check out that title. That's a pretty dumb title.

Maybe instead of ""dumb,"" I should've written ""silly."" Meh. I'm six sentences into this review already. Too late to turn back now.

The point being: this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. This is fine in a film, as long as it's a consistent goal, and one reached with some level of skill, which is where this film falters.

The story is about Joe, a mechanic with low aspirations. Joe's girlfriend, Beth, breaks up with him at the start of the film for reasons that would sound very mature to your average thirty-something, but which are made to seem domineering and overbearing in the film. She is presented as a villain because she wants him to be more interested in doing something with his life rather than sitting around listening to and playing heavy (doom? gloom? crash?) metal and smoking weed. Joe is able to do these things indefinitely because he lives with a friend named Eric who is an ""accidental millionaire."" How this is the case is never elaborated on, although it does explain why Eric and his friend, Hung (Peter Dinklage! I kept telling my girlfriend, ""Man. That guy looks a LOT like Peter Dinklage. But surely he wouldn't be in a movie like this.""), are able to dress to the nines for their LARP sessions (Live Action Role Play). To help Joe get over his heartbreak, they bring him to a massive LARP festival where they accidentally summon a demon with a spell book that Eric bought from eBay.

That's actually pretty funny.

Where the movie fumbles is when it tries to be both horror and comedy. This is such a tricky thing to pull off that it's rarely done perfectly. There is some shocking and pretty gruesome violence in the film, and likeable characters die, and they die in pretty unforgiving scenes about which there is nothing funny. It makes the film feel uneven. It goes from slapstick to stab-stick without really letting the two mesh. There are a few moments that meld the funny with the gory, but overall the violence and humor aren't blended properly to give the movie the feel it wants to have.

Also, the climax, during which our heroes must battle the End Level Boss, has a few flubs to it as well. The movie-makers must not have had much confidence in the special effects required to create their Big Bad, because it is constantly filmed in swerving, dipping, headache-inducing shake-cam. When it IS focused on properly, yes, it is less horrifying than a strangely inarticulate plastic creation. Even that could be forgiven as the necessary evils of a low-budget film if it weren't for the method with which the bad guy is finally attacked. I don't want to give anything away, but the final showdown was pretty embarrassing as far as film-making/story-telling goes. It is meant to be a joke, but it's not a very good joke, and it goes on too long, stretching out what little humor there is into something paper thin.

Every actor does a bang-up job, and the general concept is pretty funny, but the execution is spotty, and the penultimate scene is so ridiculous that the movie goes from being ""funny dumb"" to just plain dumb.",1392595200,3,3212,4.632688927943761

It wasn't that Steve Zahn or Ryan Kwanten, or Summer Glau or W. Earl Brown (come on!! that guy is sooo good, totally wasted) didn't do good jobs, it's that they were in a picture that never had anywhere close to the comedic confidence of a ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Army of Darkness"" or ""Buckaroo Banzai"" or ""Napoleon Dynamite"" or even ""Big Trouble in Little China"" Michael Gladis, Joshua Malina, and Brian Posehn (in an uncredited cameo)?

Peter Dinklage was amazing. His stage presence and good looks make him dwarf everyone else(pun not intended, but I'm good with it), so it's not surprising to see what happens to him.

6192977,4,B00HNTOYQC,"I've been waiting (impatiently) for Knights of Badassdom since it's previews first appeared at Comic Con a few years back. Now, the wait is over, and I find myself torn over this movie.  Here's why. (Spoilers ahead)

While I love the concept of the movie (despite its relative simplicity), I think that there are definitely a few faults with it. First of all, only one character avoids the stereotypical LARPer that so many misinformed movies portray, and that is Summer Glau; who, may I mention, vows never to LARP again at the end of the movie. This is the same problem I have with a lot of shows that try to portray nerds, geeks, or any color thereof; I know A LOT of people that play in LARPS and RPGs. Most of them are pretty normal, well-acclimated members of society. Perpetuating these stereotypes is harmful for the community as a whole, and it strikes me as odd that a movie that advertises itself as a LARPER's wet dream would stoop to this. And while this does run me raw! what really perturbs me is the fact that the only character growth throughout the movie occurs in characters that eventually decide to abandon LARPing. As if LARP is a stage in one's life that mature people outgrow.

The second thing that really got me was somewhat sillier. This movie had adverts that made my blood boil with excitement. I expected to end this movie with a fiery buzz spinning around my head, along with a strong desire to go beat the hell out of things with padded sticks. Instead, I came out with a strong sense of entertainment, but a feeling of slight insult (see above). The end of the movie really didn't satisfy my craving for adrenaline.

That being said, all of the issues I mentioned above really only arise in the last fifteen or so minutes. Instead of running away like a bunch of LARPers would logically do, I think that a movie titled KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM would have shown an army of LARPers make a huge stand against the demon. Then, instead of the main character banishing it with Doom Metal, the wizard should have gotten some character development and done the deed amidst a glorious battle. Instead of having the characters quit LARP, they should have ended the movie with a rousing speech, with the main characters leading the charge against other LARPers, THEN cut to how their lives carried on (hopefully adding a few more positives to balance out the comedy). Mainly, I just wanted them to end on a more upbeat note.

All that being said, I'm now going to take a moment to say that this movie was STILL epic. It's the first legitimate movie about LARPing I've seen, and it did a damned good job with almost every aspect. The characters were all good (even if some were a bit too stereotypical), the cinematography was good, and the comedy was pretty spot-on most of the time. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I intend to watch it many, many more times.  But next time I watch it, I'm going to stop it about 2 minutes from the end and ad-lib my own little ending.",1392163200,,2992,4.521256931608133
6192978,5,B00HNTOYQC,"This movie will likely induce a nerdgasm in anyone who has ever enjoyed RPGs, AD&D, high fantasy, low fantasy, or anything else similarly fun.  Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones) is always amazing, Ryan Kwanten is basically nerding up his role as Jason from True Blood, and Summer Glau (Firefly, Serenity, The Sarah Connor Chronicles) rocks her performance.  The most fun I've had in the theater in ages, and destined for cult classic status!  WATCH IT NOW!",1392163200,4,455,4.9605263157894735

6192980,1,B00HNTOYQC,"Please! For the love of god and all that is holy! Do not purchase or rent this version of the film. It is not the cut that was meant by the director. It's some horrible bastardization cut by some dude in a suit that had no idea what the idea of a cult classic is. If a Director's Cut version hit, then yes, by all means by it! If not, avoid at all costs.",1392076800,6,354,3.7972972972972974

Peter, Ryan, and Steve must have been friends before this movie because their buddy relationshiP emulates throughout.

This would make a good TV series (along the lines of the old Friday the 13th TV series, they could hunt and destroy 'evil'  with real METAL), has everything that's popular now, nerds, occult, metal...when is the video game coming out?

8633896,3,B00HNTOYQC,"This odd film feels like two halves of two different films. I bought this film expecting a comedy. A satire of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LARPing/dp/1538212110/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LARPing</a>&nbsp;(i.e., Live Action Role Play). That's what they do at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renaissance-Faires/dp/1479859729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renaissance Faires</a>, where everyone pretends to be a knight or king or sorcerer, etc. But midway into the film, the story veers into gory horror. Central characters that we've come to care about are brutally killed.

After the first bloody murder, I thought, ""Hey, that's not funny!"" That's when I realized, this is a horror film.

It's odd. The film is marketed as comedy. Look at the poster art and the title. But in the cast interviews, the actors talk about the joys of making a horror film. One of them says that the ""LARPing community"" won't be offended, because this film was never intended as a satire of LARPing, and that the LARPing community is treated with respect.

Actually, I think the first half of the film IS a pretty good satire of LARPing.

The film feels confused about its genre. Even after the bloody murders start, the film retains a gonzo, ""fun"" feel. Like, ""Whoa! Here comes the monster!"" Which is odd, because many sympathetic leads are brutally killed. Indeed, the film ends with a huge massacre. I won't spoil by revealing who survives.

Many fine actors in this film, including Summer Glau (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-The-Sarah-Connor-Chronicles/dp/B00168HARG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a>), Peter Dinklage (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B07615CVB1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>), and Steve Zahn (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SubUrbia/dp/B0788XQ679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SubUrbia</a>). Some survive. Some don't.

I'm a huge horror fan, so although I was expecting a comedy, I enjoyed the film. It felt weird seeing this comedy turn into horror, but, okay.

It's not a great horror film. Not a great comedy. But enjoyable entertainment with a talented cast.",1522540800,3,2377,6.877076411960133
