5952801,5,B0023TZ3QC,"This movie is great! It is easily the funniest movie Ive ever seen. I am not usually a fan of college-humor-type-movies like this, but this one was hilarious. Seth Green is great in this movie!",1229126400,2,193,4.542857142857143
5952802,3,B0023TZ3QC,"The shy guy wonders if he will ever make it with any girl?
His best friend is actually a girl, so he has a better
insight than he knows about girls.
We all are hoping it works out in more than a handy manner
for him.
His brother has no clue about girls either...
He asks two freaky friends who are just lost and they can't enlighten him either.
If you are shy too, this might be a movie that you don't like at first
as he has real communication problem, you know?
But everything probably works out in the end.",1226793600,,509,4.0495049504950495
5952803,4,B0023TZ3QC,"You're better off not listening to the two new idiots on At the Movies when it comes to Sex Drive. Just because the plot has a teen who wants to lose his virginity, doesn't mean the movie is trying to be SuperBad. There's been many movies like that before SuperBad. If anything, the lead gets caught up in the kind of awkward situations that Jim in American Pie would. While James Marsden acts like someone that would be a relative of the Stiffler's. The plot where he wants to meet a girl from the internet is even like Eurotrip...not SuperBad.

  On At the movies they even tried saying that the actors in it are even trying to be like the characters in SuperBad and that they even dress like them. Sorry, this is just how teens dress and they dress better here than they did SuperBad. Those new guys on At the Movies need to be replaced. When reviewing Max Payne, they even said that Mila Kunis is only 19, yeah like 5 years ago she was lol.

  They also said that Seth Green and James Marsden are the only good things about the movie. They are very funny but a lot of the best laughs happen when they aren't even on screen. The 3 teen leads carry the movie fine. Sure you have seen movies where a teen would have to dress up in a silly looking costume or where the hot girl best friend has a big crush on the main guy who's about to hook-up with someone else. But the actors here have enough charm and chemistry that I didn't care that a lot of the plot was familiar. The movie still manages to be enjoyable with some surprises even. I didn't expect much from the movie but I laughed a lot.",1224892800,,1594,4.2098360655737705
5952804,3,B0023TZ3QC,"Pretty much everything has been done before in teen sex comedies and the creators of Sex Drive know it. To counteract the expected clichs they have reversed the roles of a few of the stereotypical characters and intensified the vulgar events, but sadly we've seen this story, these characters, and these gags before. More often than not it's still funny, but any originality has been all but lost.

Ian is the typical, awkward too-nice-guy desperate to lose his virginity before going off to college. Felicia is his best friend since childhood who he secretly hopes will become more than that. Lance is the scoundrelous bad boy that all the ladies love. When these three misfits embark on a reckless road trip to Tennessee with the plan for Ian to sleep with a sexy and mysterious girl he met on the internet, the trio will inevitably encounter all manner of chaos from an unimaginable array of eccentric characters.

The characters introduced throughout Sex Drive are the epitome of clich - there's the nerdy protagonist desperate to lose his virginity, the pretty girl best friend who he secretly loves, and the suave ladies' man who will show him how to get the girl. There's even the ruthless older brother Rex (think Stifler) who antagonizes and embarrasses young Ian at every turn. The big difference with Sex Drive is that the actors chosen for each role don't match the preconceived appearances for these types of characters. Ian doesn't look nerdy enough, Lance doesn't look suave enough, Felicia isn't laid back, and even Rex doesn't always come across as intentionally wicked. This contrast of looks with character traits provides both a unique take on the genre and a harder grab for believability. When the short, fat kid with glasses is the one that can woo any girl with ease, one has to wonder if this intentional stereotype reversal is confusing, refreshing, or inspiring. At least Seth Green is there as backup with his always uproarious sarcastic Amish mechanic.

The R rating is a welcome sight as it allows the comedy to reach even more risqu and adult heights (and perhaps appeal to a bigger audience), but the gross-out humor does just that - provoking disgust from the viewer in ever bigger doses as each gag outdoes the last in an inverse proportion of laughs to vulgarity. For every bizarre, unexplored and ultimately hilarious predicament introduced (Mexican donut costumes, Amish shindigs, abstinence pledges) there is an equally overused and rehashed concept (rebellious road trips, crazy hitchhikers, extreme male nudity). Sex Drive does have its inventive moments, but with all the repetitious jokes scattered throughout, one has to wonder if they've seen this all before.

5952933,3,B0023TZ3QC,"I'll admit my surprise at this film. I foolishly purchased it because I thought that it would be a teen sex comedy in the vein of those produced by the Asylum. This is not even close to that. It's a moderately bigger-budget film, and Seth Green is involved in it so the quality is a cut above what you'd find in those other pics.

It's also not as sexy, so if you're looking for nudity and sex, look elsewhere. Even the unrated cut simply throws in dropped-in shots of naked people (women and men both) that have little to nothing to do with everything else that's happening on-screen--nothing of the actual movie actresses.

What surprised me is how funny that the movie is--the writing as well as the acting. Clark Duke is absolutely amazing in this; I can't believe that it didn't lead to bigger roles in other movies or TV, because this guy is as sharp in his ad lib and delivery skills as anybody I've ever seen on camera. The whole cast works together very well and seems to have been enjoying what they were doing. It does resort to toilet humor just a little too often (literally--more time is spent in bathrooms in this movie than probably any other movie I've ever seen), but beyond that, funny movie that's worth checking out if you've got a healthy sense of humor.",1472342400,,1276,4.472103004291846

Realistically? I'd expect you to be pleasantly surprised. It is funny. The characters are good, the plot is acceptable, the jokes are standard crude goofy schlock. But it's good crude goofy schlock. Seth Green's Amish character is very amusing.  The humor is in the vein of all the ditzy high school sex related comedies (American Pie, etc)

This film is also why I'm one of the few people that knows Clark Duke as ""That guy from Sex Drive"" as opposed to ""That guy from Hot Tub Time Machine.""

Would I have spent money to see this in the theater and been happy with the cost? I'm not sure. It's funny enough, but I'm not sure so funny that I would've raced out and seen it in the theater.

Car's cool and the music's above average generally
Over-the-top plot saved by accurate portrayals and human responses

The version I watched is edited by even so, it's a bit rich

At times it seems as if the show's celebrating youthful decadence

It is a outstanding comedy that makes you laugh the whole way. A simple synopsis of the plot is.. Ian is a 18 year old virgin who has trouble with women and desperately wants to lose his virginity to fit in . His family doesn't respect him and he is constantly picked on by his older brother Rex. His best friend, Lance, is not who you would expect to be the film's 'ladies man' but he has a smooth persona and is able to charm women into just about anything. Felicia is Ian's best friend and his love interest however she shows no interest back (due to them being best friends). Ian has been talking to a girl over the internet and when his family goes out of town to a motocross race Ian steals Rex's 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge and decides to go on a road trip to the internet girl. This film is about what happens shortly before, during, and shortly after that road trip.

The comedy in this movie is side splitting and makes you constantly laugh. It is one of those movies that you can't help but to love because of it's comedy. As the directors and other reviewers have said if you buy/have the unrated version watch the theatrical version first. The unrated version has more humor and is funny but might ruin the film for you if you watch it first.

When it comes to comedies i tend to be able to only watch a particular one once or twice every 6 months or it starts to lose its humor to me. SexDrive has no such problem, i watch this often and it is still as funny as the first time. It is my go to movie when im having a bad day and just want to laugh.

This is a great movie it is hilarious and fun to watch, it is especially fun to watch with people who have never seen it because some of their reactions are priceless. I have watched this with people who have laughed so hard they nearly fell out of their seats.

I cannot say too much about the plot or the funny parts without ruining it for people who haven't seen it and are reading this to decide if they should buy it or not. My advice is if you like sexually related comedy then buy it because this film won't let you down.

5/5 starts GREAT FILM and worth every penny.",1349568000,,2341,4.102620087336245

So in order to meet ""Ms. Tasty"" (Katrina Bowden), Ian (Zuckerman) and his friends steal his brothers GTO and travel across country so Ian can have his encounter. The movie goes on from there in a trek across country to meet this 'hot' gal and along the way the friends have many hilarious adventures.

The lead actors are actually what make the movie enjoyable. The script, though, needs work as although some of the lines are classic, the story is tired.

In a juicy bit part, Seth Green is beyond classic as a wisecracking sarcastic as all get out Amish dude.

Extras include an unrated version which near as I can tell has gratuitous nudity that doesn't remotely fit into the story. I suppose it works for teenage boys who have no clue how to use the Internet. Otherwise, why did they bother?",1301875200,,683,4.491935483870968

I think that somone who is older but doesn't mind the humor of the younger adults (17 to 22) then this movie would be a must.

The movie zooms along at a fast, entertaining clip.  It is chock full of hilarious moments.  I don't want to spoil this for anybody seeing it for the first time, but it is incredibly funny.  You want to hear each joke and pay attention to the sight gags.

Well, well done.  I have seen the movie 3 times, now, and laughed each time.

She constantly overlooks him, takes him for granted, cries on his shoulder.  Eventually, however, she realizes he was the right one for her.  If you don't see this within ten minutes as a viewer, then I hope you're enjoying your time during Rumspringa.  Speaking of that...

Much like Eurotrip, and many other rite of passage teen comedies, a young man named Ian (Josh Zuckerman) who works at a donut store meets a beautiful girl online - moniker Ms. Tasty (Katrina Bowden) - and hopes to meet up for a wild night that will make him a man.  Spurred by his unlikely suave friend Lance (Clark Duke) and his best friend Felicia (Amanda Crew), Ian plans to drive 9 hours from Chicago to Kentucky to, as the euphemism is later called, ""visit grandma.""  The perpetual quest for teen boys to break their virginity is a topic that falls perfectly in line with the American Pie series.  In line with the hilarity of those movies (only the first four), Sex Drive has its own glorious version of Stifler.  As Ian's older brother, James Marsden exudes the brash, aggressive, big man on campus for his character Rex.

The dialogue in the script is at times crass and at others edgy and sarcastic.  Typically hilarious throughout, and exactly what I expected from Seth Green.  His recurring role as Ezekial, a philosophizing Amish car repairman who likes to use dry wit and sarcasm to guilt-trip people into paying for the services he so kindly ""offers.""  Green steals every scene.

While no doubt formulaic and predictable, Sex Drive is no less hilarious.  If you appreciate the genre, you'll be pleased after watching this.

5953409,5,B0023TZ3QC,"Sex Drive is about a teenager who goes on a search concerning his virginity.  He simply HAS to sleep with a girl in order to feel like he's finally become a man.

The most interesting thing about this film is that you're probably thinking it's a cheap, typical low budget storyline involving the same teenage behavior we've seen a thousand times in other comedy films, but... surprisingly, it's actually a LOT more creative than that.  This film actually excels in telling a really good story.  I was NOT expecting that!

Check out the conclusion of the film when everything finally comes together- now THAT is definitely creative writing!  All the pieces fall together in such a way that really proves a lot of dedication was given in order to develop the storyline *just* right.

Anyway, the teenager who's determined to lose his virginity has a hilarious older brother (who has some surprises of his own that we find out about later on).  He's funny because he constantly picks on his younger brother and gets in little jabs all the time about him preferring the company of men over women, to which the younger brother gets irritated by it of course.

There is a REALLY strong emphasis on adventure.  That's one thing you must know above and beyond everything else.  It's a road trip adventure where the teenager (along with his two friends- one of whom is a female who plays a crucial role later on) meet a variety of people.

The most creative people they meet are the Amish.  Now the way the Amish are portrayed in this film is *really* far fetched beyond description, but for a few laughs I enjoyed these segments.

I also enjoyed the segments where the teens had to pee in a car motor in order to get it to work, lol.  My favorite segment however, is when the one teen is forced to run through a corn field with his hands handcuffed to part of a bed, so he has to run through the corn with the bed way up high in the air, lol.

Throughout the movie the teens find themselves ticking off some bad people and immediately take off running for their lives, and some of the bad guys come back again for another chance at revenge against the teens.  Really enjoyable scenes these are.

There is a pretty strong focus on strong sexual content, however the actual nudity only occurs in two or three scenes.  A *lot* of jokes about sexual references though- please keep this in mind.  Definitely not a film for children or anyone below the age of 18.

What's nice is that the main difference between the teen sex comedies of the 1980s and the teen sex comedies of today is the fact that the producers seem to have learned the Hughes lesson which is that teenagers are not JUST hormononl psychos who need to get laid. But thankfully, the John Hughes strangely celibate teens aren't the mainstay either. Ever since American Pie, most of these teen sex comedies have been a balancing act between crude sex jokes and serious coming-of-age movies.

Some are more successful than others. Some do give you the blatant cruelty of old crap like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Porky-s-the-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B000O76ZNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Porky's the Ultimate Collection</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-American-Virgin/dp/B00009OWJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last American Virgin</a>&nbsp;and others get maudlin. And the plot of a guy trying to get laid and realizing that he needs to grow up instead - it works because it reflects the life of many of the viewers (no matter the age) but it is a little old.

For the most part this is a pleasant diversion. The main characters are likeable enough. The story hits most of the beats. However, James Marsden and Seth Green push it over into recommended. These are both talented actors who don't get enough due. Seth Green is featured on the commercials, but his passive-aggressive Amish mechanic character is a wonder to behold. James Marsden feels one note until the last 10 minutes and then he gets a lot more to do and he's great.

I grew up in the 90's when AOL was just up and coming and I was around to see compuserve (and several others I can't remember, guess that means i'm getting old?!) I always fantasized about meeting some hot chick online and driving out to meet her (and I did meet several but never had quite the adventure these guys had!).
The plot is great, the acting is superb, and seth green's appearance and screentime are just right. The movie itself is sort of 80's/90's-ish (and maybe that's why I like it so much). The situations are hilarious and the Goat (GTO) is one of the hottest since My Science Project!

I am a recent college graduate and 22 years old.  I feel that is important because I think a lot of the humor is directed at our generation.  With that said, I had to have been laughing at least 70% of the movie.  Literally, I was laughing during 70% of the movie or more.  This was one of the funnest movies I've seen in awhile.  The fat friend might have been unbelieveable as the role he was playing, but that is part of the humor.  Kids like him usually aren't like the way he was.  And seriously, how could people not find Seth Green hilarious?  He was the funniest character in the whole movie, gratned I am a really big fan of sarcasium.  I am sorry, but if you don't think this movie is funny, you just have a poor sense of humor if you are in the age range of 15-25.  Outside that range I could see where some might not understand the humor at younger ages or get offended/put-off by some of the abbrasive, out there humor.

Ok, yes this movie has a predictable ending and maybe some of the jokes are predictable... so what?  About 95% of movies I have watched in recent years I have been able to call the ending, pick up key speech, etc.  before it happened in the movie.

An awkward teenage virgin meets a girl on the internet and decides to drive 9 hours to meet her in his brothers stolen 69 GTO Judge!

5953451,4,B0023TZ3QC,"This movie sounded BORING when a friend told me the plot. Frightened virginal teenage boy with best female friend falls for girl (""Ms. Tasty"")on the internet, and heads out to score. YAWN. How many times can they retread this storyline?

Well, it turns out, at least this once more. SEX DRIVE will never be memorable, like, let's say, RISKY BUSINESS, and it won't ever define a genre, like, for example, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, but as teen-angst/coming-of-age movies go, it's a cut above. I actually found myself collapsed in gales of laughter at one or two points.

In large part, it's because SEX DRIVE spoofs itself with point-counterpoint humor that is dead-on.

The unrated version has occasional naked lovelies walking nonchalantly down the street. Okay. It has the hypermasculine older brother (a closet gay) who drives a GTO ""The Judge"" tricked out like the ""General Lee."" Okay. It has the Poindexter Casanova who happily seduces all the girls his frightened cuter friend puts off. Okay. It samples a lot of it's own genre. The sampling, unbelievably enough, works.

But SEX DRIVE becomes absolutely inspired when it's three protagonists find themselves stranded in an Amish village where teenagers experiencing Ramspringa drink themselves sick, make love in haylofts, and rock out to head-banging music. It's an Amish universe where Seth Green (in a brilliantly funny role) plays it for keeps as a sarcastic, oversexed Amish man who loves to rebuild cars:

""No. You don't owe me anything. In our religion it's considered acceptable to do backbreaking labor for total strangers and not even get a lousy thank you. It's okay man. We're cool. Yeah. We're cool. No. Really."" {humph}

""Man, I remember Ramspringa. I went to Vegas. I miss the gambling. The drinking. The nightlife. The hookers. b*%%$%!&ing. You ever do that? It's time man. What am I saying? It's cool to be Amish. It's cool to drive this buggy while people like you try to run me off the road. Not your problem."" {humph}

I wasn't disappointed at all, and this was one of my favorite comedies in a year that was filled with great ones.  While it's basically your typical teen comedy that's been kicked off since American Pie so long ago, there are some clever laughs and nice cameos throughout the film that make this refreshing and not a by the numbers film.

James Marsden in particular stands out in this as an incredibly obnoxious and homophobic brother to the lead, and it's weird to think that this is the same guy that played Cyclops in the X-Men films.  The rest of the cast is solid, although somewhat unbelievable such as Clark Duke being such a ladies man.  The girls Amanda Crew and Katrina Bowden are cute, the two punk kids give some great one liners, and Seth Green does a great job as a sarcastic Amish guy.  Throw in a mexican donut suit, and you've got some great outlandish scenes and laughs.  Highly recommended.

The Blu-ray is sparse on extras which is a disappointment, as they dropped those off in favor of the Unrated cut which as mentioned by other reviewers, full of just random nudity and more of a jab at other movies with unrated versions that add nothing but 2 minutes of changed dialog.

I will tell you that the UNRATED version is kind of corny because they use the same footage but then green screen some naked ladies running around on the screen. That is the majority of the UNRATED aspect and on top of that the UNRATED is not really for an individual viewing.

Gratuitous shots of nude (and often tattooed) women were added in random scenes and there's even a few full frontal shots of males thrown in for the ladies (or dudes into dudes).

The film also incorporates adlibs and various alternate takes into the actual film rather than put them on the DVD as stand-alone ""bonus features."" All of these aspects separate ""Sex Drive"" from the other ""nice guy teen seeking to lose his virginity"" comedies and made for an unrated DVD comedy experience that finally lives up to its title.

But I have to say I was glad I gave this one a shot.  ""Sex Drive"" is as cliche and dumb as they come, but it delivers in the areas that count for this genre: T&A, astounding profanity, likeable actors, disgusting humor, and more T&A.  This is a double-sided disc featuring both the R-rated and lengthy unrated cut.  I chose to watch the unrated cut and was greeted with a hilarious introduction imploring me to watch the original cut first while promising mucho nudity in the unrated cut.  Make up your mind, people!  Don't promise me extra nudity and then tell me to watch the version with less.  That's just counterproductive.  Oh, and the creators giving the introduction are flanked by full-frontal nudity of male and female varieties as they speak.  Unrated version it is!

The plot is stupid.  Standard.  Nonexistent. Unimportant.  Unecessary, even.  Typical sex-comedy loser with hot chick BFF meets non-BFF hot chick on the internet offering him sex if he comes to see her IRL.  Loser grows a pair, steals violent homophobia-spewing brother's awesome car, takes pimpin' male friend and winds up taking female BFF on road trip to lose virginity. Jeez, I wonder if he'll really go through with it [rolls eyes].  Time for a new story concept, sex-comedy writers. Every possible stereotype and convention is explored save the catchphrase-machine black dude.  Thank God they spared us one.  This is all garbage, but what does work are the jokes, and that's what really matters.  I laughed out loud a lot. Seth Green steals the movie as the world's most sarcastic Amish man in what is easily his best non-stop-motion-animated work in many years.  Without him, this movie would barely round up to an even 3 stars.  Kyle Gass of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tenacious-D/dp/B000MCH5RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tenacious D</a>&nbsp;fame makes a very funny appearance as well.

Jokes, jokes, where are the jokes?  Right.  Gloryhole humor, a shopping mall donutman with a strapon and later a gun, an abstinence pledge erection, shooting a condom into stepmom's hair, a camera shot of an old man's balls that about lasts for an entire conversation that seems to go on for 10 minutes, and yes even a little scat humor.  Either this sort of thing is your bag, baby, or you are out by this point.  Fair enough; this lowbrow stuff isn't for everybody.  But if it is for you then a good time will be had.

Now I see why the director would urge somebody to see the original cut first.  The unrated cut is sloppy and leaves in a lot of outtakes where an actor would bust up laughing when he wasn't supposed to.  Hell, at one point the camera even pans to the director on the side of the set urging them to keep going.  Also, there are the random inserted naked people.  Every now and then, a naked woman will just walk in front of the scene or there will be some dude with his johnson swinging in the breeze juggling or something in the background.  This doesn't make for a very immersive story, but when the story is as disposable and generic as this one, the lack of taking it seriously only helps.  At about two hours, it runs long but not more so than the often exhausting Appatow unrated efforts.  And when a film spends as much time on anatomical close-ups as this one then time will indeed be consumed. There's also a post-credits bit that pokes fun at one of the most annoying cliches of the sex comedy.  Unfortunately, it also upholds it in the end.  But I do appreciate the teasing self-deprecation displayed.

""Sex Drive"" may not be a sterling example of the genre and there are certainly better comedies out there, but there is a lot to like as well for fans of gross-out and sexual humor.  I love the obnoxiousness and in-your-face carelessness of the unrated cut and would likely never bother with the R-Rated version since this is a genre I don't take seriously as art in any way, shape, or form.  I just want to see something gross, something sexy, something funny, and some really obnoxious characters doing idiotic and absurd things.  Mission accomplished.

5953459,5,B0023TZ3QC,"""Sex Drive"" isn't ""Superbad"" but it's still a very hilarious movie.  Ian is an 18-year old virgin who wants to drive from  Chicago to Tennessee to have sex with the girl of his dreams whom he has been chatting with online.  His best male friend Lance tags along and he ends up stuck with his best female friend Felicia, lying to her about why he is taking the trip.  On the way he runs into white trash, psycho hitchhikers and partying Amish people, among other strange characters.  James Marsden is great as Rex, Ian's evil older brother, Seth Green is funny as a sarcastic Amish guy, and there is an appearance by Fall Out Boy as well.

There's always a delicate balance in these teen sex comedies between juvenile sex jokes and actually having a decent story and ""Sex Drive"" does well in this particular area.  I found myself both caring about the main characters and laughing at the bawdy jokes.  I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well in the theaters (I admit I didn't see it there), but it should have gotten more word of mouth.

Along for the ride are his two best friends (Clark Duke and Amanda Crew), and naturally, there's all sorts of chaos as the crew head to Knoxville, including running into hillbillys and other assorted weirdos.  While its story is old and tried (a love triangle is suggested between the trio but nothing ever grows out of it, and instead veers off into predictable territory), Sex Drive manages to stay entertaining thanks to the game cast (including a perfectly cast Seth Green as a sarcastic Amishman, and James Marsden as Ian's hilarious, foul-mouthed brother) and genuinely funny developments.  The climax of the film is a bit of a surprise, but worth the ride to get there.  The Unrated version of the film intercuts tons more nudity and even blooper scenes into the film, and manages to overstay its welcome at over two hours, so this is one of the rare cases where the theatrical version is the better cut.

This movie deals with the awkwardness and frustration that everybody goes through during their teenage years, but unlike other movies it uses technology and terms that few, if any previous movie had done before. For example, there are hilarious references to Myspace, Msn Messenger, and text messaging that show us just how technology pretty much runs a teenager's life nowadays. My wife and I both saw it in the theatres, and both of us laughed our pants off the whole time. Her only complaint was that there was too much Nudity in the film. Don't listen to people like that guy that gave this movie a 2 star review. They are probably winey, stuck up little snobs that don't appreciate over-the top humor of films such as this one. They probably prefer trash like the pink panther movies that have Boring jokes and hidden innuendos instead of just giving it to you straight up!",1235088000,6,1028,4.653846153846154
5953484,4,B0023TZ3QC,"Plenty to read about regarding this film out in the Internet world. The trailers have been playing in the store for a month now and the buzz has been positive (since no one got to see this in theaters). Analyzing a high budget teen/sex comedy for acting is pointless, so I will stick with the BD quality and extras.

The video and audio look and sound fine, typically the outer channels get used with the LARGE volume of songs played throughout; and some nice GTO throttlings. The special features have roughly 30 minutes of docus reviewing production and self loathing/lampooning of the cast: Marsden Dilemma & Duke of the Internet clips.

The big question: differences between the UR and R. Plenty to list. 20 extra minutes of gratuitous male and female nudity, longer takes of certain scenes (the two confident geeks verbiage, pool party, condom buying fiasco, left-in flubs, changed phrases, sex sounds [sheep, bjs, etc.]), most noticeably - CGI-imposed nudity in 20 or so random scenes with a graphic intro by the director/writer about what to expect in the UR version.

Overall, a funny film with plenty of comedian cameos, decent writing, love searching, and sexual awakenings (even in the Amish country). A worthwhile purchase for fans of the film plus they kept it all one on disc (everything is the same as the 2 disc DVD).",1235088000,20,1333,4.837719298245614
5953485,5,B0023TZ3QC,"I've heard a lot of criticism about this movie saying, ""oh it's not original"" ""we've seen this before"" and then they go to compare it to some OLD 80s Teen Comedy.  Heck, even comparing it to a 90s teen comedy wouldn't be fair.

My point is that the teens comedies are meant to strike at well... Teens of today... not teens of 20 or 10 years ago.

See... if I watch a teen comedy of the 80s... there's no WAY i can relate to those fads BUT i can relate to the common teen themes of exploration.  Which is exactly what Sex Drive does.  Yes it does have similarities to old teen films but it places them in more recent times.

Overall this film was great and it had a lot of heart.  It annoys me that people who grew up watching 90s and 80s teen comedy's give it low ratings when it is meant for younger audiences that have probably never seen those old comedies and even if they did, would not be able to relate to them.",1234742400,4,918,4.094972067039106
5953486,1,B0023TZ3QC,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.

The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.",1234656000,,926,4.544910179640719

5953489,2,B0023TZ3QC,"Prompted by some positive reviews of this movie, I felt i had to add that that this movie was not funny.

After an ok looking movie trailer, I decided to see this with my wife and have a laugh or two. We are both 22 and we are not some weird old couple.
But this movie was just bad.

After the movie starting off very slow and the plot being pretty dumb, the momentum was not there. After the fourth homophobic remark from the main characters brother, I thought to myself "" ok, might be funny to some but this is really over doing it"". they finally get on the road and I give the movie a little more slack.

  One liner after one liner jokes fill a gaps between the over-weight, non attractive friend's sexual antics and overly confident personality. Both not funny.
  The look at the Amish rumpspringa was a little funny, but after 15 minutes of drunken Amish kids...this gets a little old.
  People look to Seth Green to save this movie, wow... I not only found Seth green a bit off, he was completely not funny at all. All his jokes and awkward pauses were ill timed and didn't make me smile or laugh.

 Now if it weren't for my wife's stubborn habit of wanting to finish something once it is started (like bad movies) I would have left the theater by now.
 But we were almost done and there could still be laughs to be had...right?

 The obvious plot was moot at this point, the chubby kid, was not funny, the jokes, the brother, the girlfriend, the red necks...not funny.
 The one time I got a cheap laugh was when the main character was holding the people hostage with the doughnut suit and a gun.

 To skip ahead, the movie is ending, I'm relieved, and it all ended as happily and as predictably as it could be, but what really mad no sense...the Friend becomes Amish because of a crush he has on a girl he knew for a week?

All in all, this movie is not as bad as lets say...Strange Wilderness (which I did walk out of).  But definitely not worth my time, I bet it's not worth yours.",1233619200,3,1991,4.247340425531915
5953490,5,B0023TZ3QC,"Although I'm still officially a teenager, I've never really been into movies like ""American Pie""; that type of humor just struck me as shallow, immature, and to put it blunty, plain stupid. I had never even heard of ""Sex Drive"" until the day I went to see it with a friend. After watching the preview online, I had rather low expectations. The further the film progressed however, the more I came to like it. The plot is ok, but it's definately the actors that make this movie; I fell in love with the characters! Especially the guy with the glasses. It's a shame this movie didn't do too well at the box office; it surely deserves more attention than it's gotten!

I don't usually like crude humor high school type comedies, which is what one would expect with the name of this film. I've rewatched it over and over. I'm not a big fan of the Unrated version, and if you're watching it for the first time, I'd suggest watching the normal R Rated one, since there's even like a couple of funny bloopers they leave in the Unrated one and there is even a warning at the beginning of the Unrated one to not watch it unless you've seen the movie already. Clark Duke is one of the funniest actors there is, and I wish he was in 10 times the amount of shows and movies that he's in. James Marsden is also hilarious in this movie and I love his character.",1524528000,,756,4.114864864864865
