The war on terror is merely a smokescreen to distract the public from the establishment of a military hegemony in the Middle East to secure its resources for the perpetuation of American civilization.  Audrey Brohy looks behind the headlines to see what is really driving the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Brohy exposes the widespread use of depleated uranium (U238) to coat warheads and artillary shells that are turning the Middle East into a zone of slow death. Do US soldiers know that U238 is also used to coat the armor of their tanks beause it's a cheap way of reinforcing steel against penetration?  That there are millions of unexploded land-mines in Afghanistan that lay waste to children and farmers unfortunate enough to contact them.  That unexploded cluster bombs coated with radioactive U238  are found in city streets and playgrounds by children.

This documentary was released in 2004, just prior to the onset of the terrible death and destruction unleashed by the sectarian schism that has since gripped Iraq.  Iraqi citizens, thankful for the demise of Saddam, bemoan and decry the US military occupation which seems far worse. Listening to these angry and frustrated Iraqi men, you wonder how many of them subsequently took up arms against the US military. Watching images of thriving outdoor markets, of the incredibly beautiful Golden Mosque and of university students and knowing that all of that has been destroyed is sobering reminder of what it means to invade a soverign nation and wage war against it.",1172016000,5,1713,5.064056939501779
8129748,4,B000GAKJM8,"If you have watched several documentaries on the war of Iraq such as ""Hidden Wars of Desert Storm"", and ""Uncovered: The War on Iraq"", you will already know much of what is presented in this documentary as the material in the film is not new.  Still, even though I have watched many of the available documentaries about our war on Iraq and closely related topics -- as well as read several books on these topics -- I still learned some things by watching this DVD.  Considering that we do not get in-depth journalism from our mainstream news media, and that many Americans still believe that we are fighting a war on terrorism, I feel this DVD is vital viewing for Americans.",1169596800,4,674,4.56198347107438
