2683438,5,B000K7UBXE,"I felt like decades since I last wrote my review on this DVD.  And finally, it's guaranteed that I'm going to get it next February.  Hurrah!!  For those of us who live in Hong Kong, we didn't have the chance to watch the good show on television.  So I was very excited to watch a few episodes when I traveled in the States, and boom.....I really like the show!!  As a fan of Michael, I wish I could have the chance to watch all seasons.  When I first heard that they would release the show on DVD, it was like a dream come true.  I can't believe that they wouldn't release the DVD earlier.  But that doesn't matter now, because I'm so glad that they now promise us a date of releasing the DVD.

I have already pre-ordered the item as a treat for myself.  I'm really looking forward to the day which I'll find the DVD in my mail box.

I bet you're not going to miss the chance of getting a copy of Family Ties on DVD.",1163980800,6,916,4.06145251396648

This was my favorite show as a child and I've been so sad because it hasn't been available on DVD.  I'm very excited to share this series with my own children as it has cute, precocious kids but they aren't sassy or doing things inappropriate for their ages as I've found in even the best of todays family programming.  It will be dated by all the political references, but those will be over my little ones heads anyway and will be great fun for me to revisit.

2683471,2,B000K7UBXE,"Love the show, that's why I ordered the DVDs, however, from season three on there are episodes missing, episodes that are from other seasons, and it upsets the viewing pleasure.  Andy will be of preschool age in one episode, the very next show he's only one year old, then the next he'll be in preschool again.  Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.  So, the two stars are for the lousy arrangement, the episodes being mixed up and in the wrong seasons, not just within one but within several seasons, and the interference in viewing pleasure, not the show itself or the DVD quality which are both great.",1396569600,,1157,4.485714285714286

2683501,4,B000K7UBXE,"This 1982-83 Season was the one that started it all about a midwestern family making the move in America from the cultural liberism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservatism of the 1980's which particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex P. Keaton(Michael J. Fox), materialistic young woman Mallory(Justine Bateman), athletic tomboyish Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross)which all resided in suburban Columbus, Ohio.

FAMILY TIES ran from 1982-89 with 180 episodes and was an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 along with the fact that this show won various awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series throughout FAMILY TIES whole 7-year run on NBC, but I was so bummed out when this show cancelled in the Spring of 1989, especially since the ratings seemed strong enough for an 8th Season to be underway for the Fall of 1989, but apparently the Keatons were getting tired and perhaps the whole cast & crew had ran out of steam.

This 1982-1983 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when FAMILY TIES was on NBC every Wednesday night right after THE FACTS OF LIFE and when this show was moved to Monday nights in the Spring of 1983 which was of course before NBC had changed their minds and moved it back to Wednesdays in the Fall of 1983, but then NBC had moved FAMILY TIES to Thursday night in the Winter of 1984.

This 1982-83 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 10 years old in the 4th grade and when NBC's motto was ""Just Watch Us Now"" which was NBC's slogan from September of 1982 thru August of 1983.

FAMILY TIES also showed a lot of Hollywood stars on the show before they were famous and/or during their early acting careers like
*Courtney Cox whom is best known as Monica Geller on FRIENDS had co-starred in the last 2 seasons of this series as Alex's girlfriend(Lauren Miller)

*Christina Applegate whom is best known for her role as the ditzy knockout blonde bombshell(Kelly Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN; had guest starred as Jennifer's pal(Kitten)in the episode ""Band On The Run""

*Judith Light from WHO'S THE BOSS appeared in Season 2 as Steven's colleague who unsuccessfully attemps to seduce him

*Tom Hanks appeared during the 1st and 2nd Seasons as Elyse's alcoholic baby brother(Ned)

*Geena Davis whom co-starred in the movies BEETLEJUICE & THE FLY had guest starred as the incompetent housekeeper(Karen)

*River Phoenix appeared in Season 4 as a 14-year old math genius who develops a crush on Jennifer after a math tutoring session with Alex

*Julia Louis Dreyfus portrayed a lawyer in the 2-parted episode ""Red It & Weep"" before her co-starring days on the spinoff series DAY BY DAY and SEINFELD

*Crispin Glover whom is known as the nerdy George McFly in the movie BACK TO THE FUTURE appeared in the episode ""Birthday Boy""

*Stephen Baldwin whom is the baby of the Baldwin brothers guest starred on this show as a member in a therapy group that Alex attended with his girlfriend

*Daphne Zuniga whom is known for her role as Jo Reynolds on MELROSE PLACE had guest starred as Alex's geeky date at the prom in Season 2

*Jane Adams guest starred in Season 7 in the 2-parted episode ""They Can't Take That Away From Me""

2683506,4,B000K7UBXE,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Family Ties"" ran on NBC from 1982-1989, with a fine ensemble cast and excellent writing.  While Michael J. Fox became the huge discovery and de facto star of the show, he was surrounded by talented actors who contributed a depth to the show which helped give it longevity.

However, one would be forgiven for mistaking the eventual classic for another show in this first season.  Uneven quality plagues its initial year.  The pilot episode is actually fairly boring, going through the motions to establish that Fox's conservative Alex Keaton is different from his ex-hippie parents Steven and Elyse.  The parents in a sitcom are very important to establishing a tone for the onscreen family, and ""Family Ties"" was very blessed to have Meredith Baxter(then Birney) and Michael Gross co-star as the Keaton parents.  Ms. Baxter is a very versatile, compassionate actress and Michael Gross is consistently able to project a loving demeanor onscreen.  Mr. Gross is also an excellent underrated dry comedian.  Justine Bateman as Mallory and Tina Yothers as Jennifer round out the Keaton Family cast for the first year.

Occasionally amidst the bad episodes(""Suzanne Takes You Down"" being among the worst), there are gems that point to the juggernaut the show would become.  One of these is ""Stage Fright,"" wherein a pompous Alex hilariously freezes up on camera during a high school quiz show.  Michael J. Fox's acting in this scene alone is a great study in effective comedic delivery.  Another episode, much more serious, would presage the occasional dramatic turns the show would take in its later years.  ""Give Your Uncle Arthur A Kiss"" concerns a Keaton family friend making untoward advances to Mallory, and features one of Justine Bateman's best performances of the series.

Although this first season is still very spotty, ""Family Ties"" suddenly receives a creative surge in its second season.  The first season is still very worth seeing as a glimpse into the materials that were there in the beginning of this exceptional series.",1277769600,3,2051,5.114114114114114
2683507,5,B000K7UBXE,"I bought this first season of Family Ties mainly for the superb acting of MJF, but was impressed by the acting of the other main characters. I have two younger sisters, so some of the episodes weren't exactly made for that younger age group, but overall, my family and I enjoy this immensely. Every episode is guaranteed to make you laugh, even if you're a stone-faced person who disregards levity! My favorite line is when Alex's Grandpa comes over and Mr Keaton reacts to his Dad's words, ""Did you know Nixon was framed?"" by getting up, leaving the room and shouting, ""He was not framed! He was a crook!!"" That had me rolling for awhile.

I recommend this season of Family Ties to anybody who enjoys good acting and funny story lines.",1235433600,2,736,4.575757575757576
2683508,3,B000K7UBXE,"Because of a ""Coach"" draught (I'm amazed at how slowly these old shows are released) I wanted to watch another friendly sitcom and I fondly remembered ""Family Ties"" from way back when. It doesn't hurt that I'm a big fan of Michael J. Fox either.

""Family Ties"" is a nice little family sitcom which I doubt seriously would offend anyone. All the family members are likable in their own way and deal with their fair share of shortcomings. What I like most about it though is their political overtone. Elyse and Steven Keaton (Meredith Baxter-Birney and Michael Gross) are old hippies who seem to have raised a die-hard Republican in Alex P. Keaton (Fox). Alex's ideals continually clash with his parents's and those moments provide some great entertainment. Although the tone is pretty lefty it is not judgemental and the clashes always end well (usually with Alex seeing the errors of his ways).

The first season of ""Family Ties"" isn't laugh out loud funny it must be said. The first three episodes in particular are not at all interesting or very funny but things pick up immediately in the fourth episode which deals nearly exclusively with Alex. The kids gradually took center stage but originally the parents were to be the real main characters.

""Family Ties"" ran for seven seasons and when shows run that long it's usually thanks in large parts to great chemistry between the cast members. It's easy to see why Fox became a hot property. He's such a natural comic performer and overall good actor and he easily carries the lesser episodes in the series. Justine Bateman grows on you as Mallory and Meredith Baxter is sincere and likable as Elyse. But here on the first season Michael Gross is easily the weakest link. His one-liners look like they're read off of cue cards and his comic talents seem to be mostly non-existent. He fares better when he's called upon to be serious (like in the episode dealing with his father and when Mallory's uncle behaves inappropriately), that's where he looks pretty solid.

Overall ""Family Ties"" is a sporadically funny but (nearly) always enjoyable sitcom. The irresistably appealing Fox carries the shows in it's duller moments but mostly it's great fun watching the goings on at the Keaton household. Nearly every reviewer here says the seasons got better and I'm taking them at their word as Season 2 is on it's way.",1219795200,3,2364,4.815270935960591

It's hard not to love a show when you've got such warm and funny characters, and writing that reflects some early 1980s politics (some things don't change). Since I hadn't seen these episodes in many years, I couldn't tell if they had been edited. What I do know is that they came in at around 24 minutes each, which is pretty good.

While there are different voices singing the theme song on a few of the episodes, it did not deter from the overall quality of this DVD set. I'm looking forward to buying season two as it should contain the hilarious episode ""The Harder They Fall"", with Alex's extremely obnoxious teacher, Ruben Tedesco.

Note added April 2008: My review was based on viewing the Region 1 DVD release; so my earlier comment about each episode being around 24 minutes long may not apply to the recently released Australian Region 4 set - see my Adam 12 review for further comments about Region 4 running times.",1191110400,2,1004,4.541436464088398
2683526,5,B000K7UBXE,"I actually would have given it 4 1/2 stars because of some of the music edited out but what the heck.. Having 4 edited episodes from Family Ties is heck of a lot better than watching complete episodes of tv shows on tv today.

Yes I was one of the fortunate one's to see Family Ties growing up in the 80's.  Hearing the theme song changed didn't make me happy initially but reading that Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams weren't the original singers anyways made up for it.  Besides episode 4.. Summer of 82 has the better theme and of course after episode 10 as well.

I can't remember the episodes in clarity as well as other's but overall even with the edits..it's still nice to go down memory lane although I do hope and wish that some of these shows such as WKRP in Cincinnati will get the music rights in gear so we can watch the shows in completion in the future :)

2683542,4,B000K7UBXE,"The premise of Family Ties is relatively simple. A pair of activists from the 60s with decidedly liberal views find themselves raising a family in the 80s with kids who are very 1980s-minded.

Yet from this simple premise was born a great television show, one that dealt with many very serious issues, but one that found comedy in all sorts of situations. Watching this much-anticipated first season release, one will find themselves laughing at the situations that the characters find themselves in, even 25 years later.

Steven and Elyse Keaton (Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter Birney) were anti-war demonstrators in the 60s, but in the 1980s things are a little different. The couple is raising three children, 17-year-old Alex (Michael J. Fox in his career-defining role), 15-year-old Mallory (Justine Bateman) and 10-year-old Jennifer (Tina Yothers). As parents they want to be sure they are raising the kids right, but they are also hoping to avoid the traps that they believe their parents fell into when raising them.

The relationship between the parents and kids, as well as the relationship between the kids, is the hallmark of this show and none of those relationships are as entertaining as the one between Alex and his parents. Alex is a hard-core Republican conservative, worshiping at the altar of Nixon and Reagan, all the while keeping track of investments and any way he can make money.  His views are obviously completely opposite of his parents and this leads to a number of hilarious encounters. Fox really brought a lot to this role and when he was cast, he was basically an unknown. This part put his career on the fast track, leading to his eventual role as Marty McFly in the Back to the Future trilogy. I remember watching this show as a kid and really enjoying the character, but watching it now with a better understanding of the political views and such, it is even funnier.

Mallory is the typical teenage girl, completely infatuated with boys, but not so much with school. While her brother shines in the academic world, she struggles in his shadow, instead electing to focus on fashion and such. But she is also a good friend and a good sister, as she helps one of her friends through a teenage pregnancy in one of her stronger storylines of the first season. She also deals with the flirtations of an old family friend. Thankfully, though the subjects were serious, the show was always able to find comedy in serious matters.

Jennifer is the perfect example of a tomboy, into sports and hanging out with boys, which gets her in trouble with some of her classmates, as they are at the age where boys and girls begin to separate. As the youngest member of the Keaton clan, Jennifer often feels overlooked, but she is always quick to put in a good punch line and play the role of precocious kid when it is needed. Often times she even comes out looking more mature than her older siblings.

In this first season, Tom Hanks makes a guest appearance as Elyse's brother, who is on the run from the authorities after stealing a large amount of money from his company. It was interesting to see Hanks at such a young age, as many in my generation know him mainly for his most recent movies.

The only disappointing thing about this set was the lack of extras, but that was expected. I am hopeful for more seasons of this fantastic show to be released, though it would be nice if they were able to put together a few extras along the way.

All in all, though, this show transferred well to DVD. It was obvious that the show was shot in the early 80s, but there were no visual side effects and everything appeared pretty clear.

2683544,5,B000K7UBXE,This is in response to the concerns a couple people have raised about the theme song. In the original broadcast run the theme song was sung by studio singers for the first 10 or so episodes only. After that new vocals were recorded by Johnny Mathis and Denise Williams over the same backing tracks and their vocals were heard on all subsequent episodes. That is exactly what happens on these DVDs. After episode 10 we get the Mathis/Williams recording on all the remaining episodes. I have all these early episodes on VHS recorded MANY years ago and the theme song - with both pairs of singers - is exactly the same.,1174694400,34,616,4.558558558558558

2683547,4,B000K7UBXE,"That being said, I don't care about the music edits in 4 out of 22 episodes.  Some people obviously care, but this was an 80s sitcom, and the only two songs anyone remembers from this show are the theme which (I guess I'm alone here) I think was done better by the two session singers than Johnny Matthis and the human bumblebee Denice Williams and Joey Vera's ""At This Moment"" which I would pay somebody to spare us from.

This was a very funny show about two hippies (Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter Birney) who manage to have a yuppie Republican son played brilliantly by Michael J. Fox, a ditzy, materialistic fashionista daughter played by Justine Bateman, and a tomboy that was a brain on Alex's level played by Tina Yothers.  The show was funny, topical for its time, and some of its episodes still stand up to this day.  The best episode by far was the two-parter featuring Tom Hanks as Ned Donnelly--Elyse's brother--running from his former employer and the FBI after doing the wrong thing for the right reason.  Heartwarming, funny, down-to-earth, and occasionally hard hitting, this was a good show with something in it for everyone who liked their sitcoms with a bit of variety each week.  It brings back great memories and--let's face it,  gang--can you really remember the music they played on this show the first year that well?  If you really want to complain about something, how about Scott Valentine being listed as a cast member for this collection?  Didn't he first come along as Nick in season 5?

Now that I look back and watch it again I like the fact that The Keatons were typical middle class family dealing with issues that happen to the middle class unlike The Cosby Show where they were wealthy. Nothing against Cosby because it was a great show but Family Ties was a show that the middle class can relate to and is a timeless classic. I can't wait for the other seasons to be released to DVD.,1174089600,,497,4.242105263157895

It gives me such a nostalgic feeling watching the Keatons' shenanigans from Season 1.  I surely hope that other season sets follow soon.  The show got better and better as the seasons rolled by in my opinion.  I've read the reviews which mention the intro music changes.  In my opinion, it really doesn't change the quality of the episodes at all.  I have been looking forward to this series release for such a long time, that it would have taken a lot more that the music changes for me to be disappointed.  But, hey, to each his own feelings.

To me the show is entertaining, the actors are sharp and witty, and the plot lines are good although I must admit being an older adult now, I was shocked and disappointed at Mr. keatons somewhat apathetic and cavalier attitude with Alex's poor behavior choice in the episode ""summer of 82"". I will not revisit some of the other reviewers complaints, however in my opinion I feel that the fans who pay $30-$40 to own this set deserve better. First the packaging, the 1st disk is fixed to the inside cover of the case, that in itself does not necessarily pose a problem. It does However when your episode list is behind it and you have to remove and hold the disk in order to view the written preview of the episodes. Other sets I own come with a separate episode guide which you can remove and view what's on the disks while not handling them, but not with this set. Next the 4th disk is fixed to the inside back cover of the case and therefore blocking the other side of the episode list so again to read those episodes you have to remove the disk and hold it, come on let's think about this, what would it have taken to include a separate small episode guide that you can remove and read without removing and handling the disks?? I just don't get it...  Lastly, it seems to me that the color on a few episodes is not the greatest it appears to have an orange tint, so I don't know what happened there although the sound is good and clear. I would certainly hope that the future releases are improved upon in the areas necessary so fans can really be happy with what they purchase.",1173657600,,1694,4.29375

The show is delightfully witty, and the themes of the show are as relevant now as they were then. I have read a few of the other reviews and I have to agree. My heart did sink a little when I read that the music was changed. It's a shame that probable fighting about song rights equated to cut scenes and a weakening of the originals.",1172620800,,429,3.831460674157303

I just want to point out that the original song (with original singers) is included before one of the episodes on the first disc, the one where Alex throws a party.  That, is the original theme song.

I must say that the set was advertised as complete, with the only acknowledged change being the music.  The program itself still has laugh out loud moments, and deserves 5 stars.  However, the dvd package is disappointing, with no special features such as outtakes, interviews, or commentary.  If in fact scenes were cut, then I would definitely believe that as a consumer, I had been short-changed.  I hope future dvd packages will give us a little more for our money.  That being said, I realized as I watched the various episodes that it truly was an ensemble series, with all of the actors contributing to its success.  I must admit that when the show first aired, I, like many others, tended to focus on the performance of Michael J. Fox.  Even now it is interesting to see how his role expanded as the series progressed, and deservedly so.  However, now we can appreciate the performances of the other actors as well.  It would be nice to have features about them on the next set of dvds.  All in all, this series is a good addition to my tv collection.",1172275200,2,1223,4.585253456221198

2683567,3,B000K7UBXE,"I came on here to complain about music issues in the Season 1 DVD. I'm a big fan of Family Ties, but I have not seen most of these episodes in at least 15 years, so I don't remember a lot of things. What I came on to complain about is that on the DVD box it says in small letters that the music is different than when the show originally aired. I had no idea that some complete scenes were missing like the other reviewers pointed out. Like I said, it's been too long for me to remember. I thought it was bad when the music on Northern Exposure was changed so they didn't have to pay for the music, but to take the entire scene out is indeed blasphemy, especially when it sayd ""Complete"" on the box. I guess those deleted scenes explains why someof the fade ins after the act break seemed odd to me. In one episode, the camera fades in an Alex goes up and turn the radio station that his dad is listening to, and complains about the song. You actually don't hear any song until he changes the station.

Anybody remember Freaks And Geeks? They refused to release those DVD's until they had all of the original music that was in the episodes that aired. And every one of those episodes had music from 3-6 popular bands. If that show which had few fans can get all of the music right, you'd think they could do it for Family Ties.

Besides that, there's some video issues, like lines through the image on the left side of the screen.

The show is still a 5/5, but we're talking the DVD set here, and it's far from perfect, and actually nowhere near as good as it should be. Sad thing is, if they cut scenes and changed the music for season 1, they'll probably do it for all of the seasons.

And lastly, there's not ANY bonus features on this DVD set at all. Not even TV ads or anything. This is the first TV DVD set I'v ever boughten that didn't have any bonus features at all.",1172102400,10,1874,4.15426997245179

I've just finished watching the first disc and it felt great to relive these moments as an adult. I'm hoping they'll release season 2 before the end of the year. There were seven seasons so there's still ways to go. I'm looking forward to the arrival of Nick, Skippy and the birth of Andy. It's too bad there aren't any special features like cast interviews or a reunion with the whole gang.

2683569,1,B000K7UBXE,"Paramount has totally let true fans of classic television down with this much-anticipated release.  Due to music issues, a handful of episodes (4 or so) have some original broadcast scenes deleted!  This is completely unacceptable.  They could have changed the music (which is bad enough in my opinion), but to delete the scene entirely is ridiculous!  As much as I loved this show, I can't bring myself to support this set.

To add insult to injury, they still used the word ""complete"" on the cover!  I've noticed in some upcoming Paramount releases that this word is suddenly missing.  Check out the cover art for ""Happy Days"" Season Two and ""Wings"" Season Four.  This leads us to wonder, are these shows truly complete, or will they suffer a fate similar to that of ""Family Ties""?

As much as I've always despised music alterations, I've still bought DVD sets that used that tactic since the shows otherwise contained all of the original broadcast footage.  But I will NOT buy a set that just hacks away at the episodes like this.  If we do support these products, the studios will just keep getting lazier and lazier.  Why should they care about putting work into their releases if the public will still gobble up whatever garbage they put out?

2683594,4,B000K7UBXE,"Thursday nights in the mid 1980's were a special time for sitcom fans.  Starting in 1984, NBC offered a killer lineup: The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers and Night Court.  Cosby may have had the most laughs, Cheers had an unbeatable cast, and Night Court was the underdog favorite.  But Family Ties had humor AND heart, and stands out in my mind as the best of that bunch.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  I realize TIES premiered in 1982.  And I also realize that this first season was a bit rough around the edges.  The juxtaposition of ""hippy"" couple Steven & Elyse Keaton with the Reagan-era 80's was the starting point of much of the humor.  And some of it may be hard for younger viewers to understand.  The ultimate irony of the Keatons' situation is that oldest son Alex was a card-carrying Republican, a living embodiment of the ""establishment"" that Steven & Elyse fought against in their own youth.

Of course, Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton would become the show's breakout star.  And with no disrespect intended to the rest of the cast, he probably deserved it.  Fox seemed born to play the role that brought him his greatest fame.  Even a less-than-stellar script (and there were a few of those in season one) could be bolstered by his presence.

It would be a couple of more seasons before Family Ties would really hit its stride.  But it's important to see it from the beginning, to watch all the characters grow (Tina Yothers in particular gets a lot less irritating in subsequent years).  I hope season one sells well, so we can get on with the better episodes.

And Paramount is quickly becoming my favorite distributor of full-season sets.  Like the recently-released ""Beauty & The Beast"" set, they've managed to cram a full season in a single DVD snap-case.",1169337600,14,1778,4.662379421221865

2683596,4,B000K7UBXE,"I really loved this show when it was originally aired. When I came across it in syndication a few years ago, I was surprised at how my memories did not match my experience. Most episodes had some good laughs, but to be honest, the entire show seemed very dated and tied to the issues of the eighties. The best part about the show is watching Michael J. Fox in action. As the young Reagan Republican with hippy middle-class parents, he steals the show from the very beginning. ""Family Ties"" would have probably have been as forgettable as the mid-80's sitcom ""Growing Pains"" if it had not been for the incredibly talented Fox.

As for dated plots in the first season, they include ""No Nukes is Good Nukes"" when the Keaton parents wind up in jail after attending an anti-nuke rally, and ""Death of a Grocer"" in which Alex leaves the employ of a small grocery he enjoys working at to work at a modern supermarket. This latter episode seems dated because the ""modern supermarket"" Alex decides to work for still looks small scale by today's standards, and would still probably wind up getting swallowed by WalMart. Also, in the discussions of premarital sex in the first season, unexpected pregnancy and hurt feelings are the main issues raised since this is before AIDS became a paramount issue.

I'd say if you haven't seen any episodes in a few years and you remember this show fondly, then you should probably go ahead and buy the first season. Just be prepared for all of the Reagan-era issues that many of the episodes are built around that have either disappeared or morphed completely over the last 25 years.",1166918400,10,1610,4.665492957746479
2683597,5,B000K7UBXE,"One of the funniest sitcoms from the 80's is finally released in dvd. This is the show that launched the career of Michael J Fox (21 years old and beautifully portraying the role of 16 year old Alex). Alex was the first child of Elyse (played by Meredith Baxter-Birney) and Steven Keaton (played by Michael Gross). Elyse was a very successful architect and Steven ran a public television station.

Alex was an avid republican (a Regan devotee) who often wore business formal attire (i.e. shirt and tie) as he wandered across the house. Mallory (played by Justine Bateman), the second born, had a relaxed personality and preferred shopping over studying. Jennifer (played by Tina Yothers) was the cute youngster in the family. The majority of the show's humor is derived from the tension between Alex's traditional mindset, Mallory's uninhibited consumerism, and their parents' attitudes (who grew up as the care-free non-materialistic children in the 1960s).

The episodes for season 1 are:

Episode 1: Pilot

Episode 2: Not with My Sister You Don't

Episode 3: I Know Jennifer's Boyfriend

Episode 4: Summer of '82

Episode 5: I Never Killed for My Father

8154707,4,B000K7UBXE,"""Family Ties"" was one of those sitcoms that struggled in the early eighties. The success of ""Cosby Show"" allowed ""Family Ties"" and other sitcoms like ""Cheers"" to survive and thrive on the must-see Thursday night programming schedule. Thank God, Brandon Tartikoff (head of NBC programming) kept this series on the air and had faith in it.

The Keatons are a family of five in the first season with Mother Elyse (Meredith Baxter Birney from ""Bridget Loves Bernie"") and father Steven (Michael Gross) to teenagers Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox) and Mallory Keaton (Justine Bateman) and 11 year old Jennifer Keaton (Tina Yothers. They live in a lovely home in Columbus, Ohio. Steven run a PBS television station and Elyse is an architect who works at home.

The first season has many memorable and funny moments. Alex P. Keaton is antithesis of his hippy Peace Corp parents. Alex is more interested in making money and Republicanism during the 1980s America. The first episode had Alex visit a discriminatory country club against his parents' wishes. Mallory is more interested in fashion and boys than schoolwork. Jennifer is more interested in playing baseball than boys.

In this four DVD disc set, you won't be disappointed but don't expect to see any special features. There are plenty of memorable guest appearances especially Tom Hanks playing Elyse's brother, Ned Donnelly, in a two part episode. I enjoyed the Christmas episode where they are stranded at home and remember the births of the children. John Randolph plays Steve's dad. Davis Spielberg played Uncle Arthur. Priscilla Morrill and Dick Sargent plays Elyse's parents in the Thanksgiving episode.",1482796800,,1661,5.121771217712177
