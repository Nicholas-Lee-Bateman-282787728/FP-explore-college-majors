8119819,4,B000FA938A,"As a big fan of John Mellencamp, and that of the earlier name Cougar, this video captures all of the good feelings of his earlier videos and work.  The only concern I have is that the video tape itself is a bit ""wobbly"" towards the last two/three numbers, but after contacting the merchant, I was given instructions on how to remedy the situation.  Overall, however, as a look back on the late 1970s, early to mid-1980's, this is a wonderful piece of music/rock 'n' roll history by one of America's great talents.",1265155200,,513,4.565217391304348
