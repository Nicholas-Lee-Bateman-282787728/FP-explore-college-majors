7964927,5,B0000694VX,"I got this DVD for the fun of it - out of curiosity - and it is truly very well done.

It explains how the SAT is organized, what sections you should work on first and then it provides strategic tips and tricks for working with each section.  It also alerts you to possible traps so you know what to watch for in each of the sections.

This is definitely very useful DVD and is bound to help you get higher scores.",1098403200,9,414,4.024390243902439
7964928,5,B0000694VX,"I was in desperate shape.  Middle aged, 20 years since my Masters' degree, 30 since my Bachelors' degree, and trying to get into school to change careers.  I might be able to tell flash RAM from a Seagate drive, but I sure didn't know a linear function from a hole in the ground.
The GRE review material was frustrating and tended to put me to sleep.  My husband tried hard to help, but it was obvious that I'd be lucky to score a 10 out of 800 on the GRE analytical.  And then I came across the Standard Deviants' Algebra series that we got for our daughter and remembered there was a SAT review.  I sent for it in a desperate hope thought that maybe it could teach me something.
It was a miracle.  The GRE is somewhat similar to the SAT (only MUCH nastier) and after spending a week on the Standard Deviants' Algebra DVD and a week on the SAT review I was able to understand the practice exam problems.  Today, three weeks after I made the decision to take the test, I passed the Analytic section of the GRE with a 530 -- good enough to be admitted into the grad school I had selected.
It's not often you get miracles this cheaply!",1056240000,32,1133,4.217592592592593
