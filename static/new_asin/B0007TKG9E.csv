My Great Pyrenees, Percy is featured in this film as is another of my dogs Kiki.  My thanks to everyone on the set in Tulsa!",1453593600,,260,3.980769230769231

8051360,3,B0007TKG9E,"I watched this expecting it to be more of a training video.  While it provides a dose of training advice it really is a survey of things to consider and prepare for before you get a dog (young or old) and it assumes that when it comes to dogs you are . . . well . . . a dummy.  So if you want training, get a DVD dedicated to training.  If you need a very basic look at what to expect if you get a dog, narrated by a not overly enthusiastic dog expert, this will do the trick.",1172966400,3,476,3.74
