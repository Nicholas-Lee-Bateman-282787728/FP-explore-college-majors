2966818,3,B000WCN8PK,"If there is such a genre as magical realism, then this movie will qualify to be one.  Set in California, it is a story of father/daughter relationship that is strange to say the least.  Charlie became father late in his life and for the most part, that was not planned.  His wife leaves Charlie and their young daughter, until one day Charlie ends up in a mental institution and his young daughter is left to fend for herself.

Once Charlie is back home, he finds his daughter has abandoned school is working at McDonalds and struggling to keep the house so she can have a place to live.  Their relationship becomes more complicated when it becomes obvious that Charlie has no intention of looking for a job and becomes obsessed with looking for a long lost Spanish treasure supposedly buried underneath the local Costco store.",1448236800,,827,4.675862068965517

2966842,4,B000WCN8PK,"Wonderful indie gem that flew way under the radar when released.

Tells the story of Miranda and Charlie.

Miranda is a sturdy, grounded, hard working teenager. Forced to give up high school in order to make ends meet - life now consists of her fast food job and maintaing the family home. Growing up quickly when her parents split up, that process sped up considerably when her father began showing signs of mental illness, culminating in a terrifying suicide attempt in which she saved his life.

She's pretty much been on her own since entering her teens.

Her dad is Charlie. And Charlie is bipolar. A condition that gets complicated when adding weed and/or alcohol into the mix. However, other than making him more distracted than usual, he's mostly harmless. Making his way through life as a part-time jazz musician and who knows what else - Miranda only sees him intermittently; sometimes a long time will pass before getting ""the phone call"".

Despite their fractured relationship - it's clear they love one another very much. Each is the only other family they have.

One day, five months prior to the present, the call is made. A request to retrieve him from yet another extended stay at a state hospital. It's the first time she's seen him in two years.

The last time was when she was 15.

After a bumpy reunion, as each has to get used to one another's presence, Charlie informs her that he has a new goal in life. He's embarking on his last great adventure - uncovering a Spanish treasure lost for more than three centuries.

And he wants her to come along.

It's clear he's still unstable; his release premature. Miranda can only hope he doesn't get into too much trouble. But as he begins to show signs that his condition is worsening, she becomes deeply torn about what to do. Her life, while far from ideal, was at least manageable. With her dad in the picture, it's quickly spiraling toward the toilet. And she's not willing to give up everything she's achieved just to facilitate his gentle madness.

But Charlie, in his own frantic, bumbling, barely coherent attempts to explain his reasoning - actually gets Miranda to listen. Really listen.

And now she's beginning to wonder if she's crazy too.

The overuse of flashbacks and some awkward editing aside, 'King' is an engaging, funny, and poignant film.

Personal Note:

Internally debated making a statement like that for a performer whose incredible career is both notable and lengthy. But I'm comfortable with it now. Barring some kind of unexpected twilight performance - this will always be tops in my book when considering Michael Douglas, the actor.

In his role as Charlie, he delivered a pinnacled and nuanced form of the craft: Sensitive, insightful, suffering, angered, passionate, melancholy, introspective (a tough one to project on film), regret, humor, madness, and love. A genuine testament to the work of a master thespian.",1393113600,,3569,5.591836734693878

2966846,5,B000WCN8PK,"""But look at the world..."" says Charlie in reply to his daughter Miranda's accusation that he takes nothing seriously and views the world as existing simply for his amusement, in Mike Cahill's lyrical and nurturing masterpiece ""King of California"". The bi-polar Charlie is played by Michael Douglas and sixteen-year-old Miranda by Evan Rachel Wood. The story is told from the put-upon Miranda's point-of-view and supplemented with both her voiceover narration and the occasional flashback.

In the flashbacks a younger Miranda is convincingly played by a pre -""Sonny with a Chance"" Allisyn Ashley Arm. Arm was not just an excellent physical match for Wood, but a stylistic one as well; the two actresses share a non-verbal acting style,  gently teasing their portrayal of a character who does a whole lot of on-camera processing of her father's often baffling and exasperating antics. In several flashbacks single parent Charlie sends his nine-year-old daughter to school with a diorama of a California mission (presumably the one in San Fernando) they just constructed, littered with ""the bodies of the Chumash Indians, who died of Syphilis and Influenza, infected by the missionaries"".  The film's most visually compelling sequence is nine-year-old Miranda striding home hurt and angry after the diorama has landed her in trouble at school, betrayed by her father's poor judgement.

Charlie is obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried somewhere near their Santa Clarita Valley house. As Miranda reads the Torres journal in voiceover, she and Charlie retrace the path of his expedition across the valley in search of the treasure he buried. There is a political element to the story in the juxtaposing of descriptions of old California with images of the suburban sprawl that has obliterated much of the state's history. This is further illustrated by Miranda's adaptive qualities and Charlie's stubborn refusal to adapt; it is the only significant difference between the two characters and introduces a lot of poignancy into the story because the quality they admire the most in each other is the one they do not share.

For Miranda, having Charlie as a father is a Southern California version of ""Alice and Wonderland"".  Her self-reliant character is positioned midway between Alice and young heroine Jeliza-Rose in Terry Gilliam's Tideland (2005). And she shares many of their virtues; innocence, courage, curiosity, wonder, kindness, intelligence, courtesy, dignity, and a sense of justice. While she shares Alice's irritation with the rude and illogical situations they encounter in their respective wonderlands, she is considerably more adaptable. Alice was a confident and proper little Victorian girl who expected a certain standard of behavior, while Miranda and Jeliza Rose are skilled at making the best of a variety of sucky situations.

Physically Wood has never looked better, like Audrey Hepburn she is more dazzling with minimal makeup and everyday fashions - including a McDonald's uniform. She simply glows in the final sequence's extreme close-ups, standing on a bluff above the beach as she processes the predicted illegal landing of a group of Chinese boat people.  And in this moment she totally sells the story, which at its core is simply the story of a father and daughter with a unqualified love for each other.  Interestingly, Wood is so effective in this final sequence that she turns what in normal screenplay structure would be the aftermath, into the film's climatic moment; then they go out with the credits.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1380499200,,3662,5.264150943396227
2966847,4,B000WCN8PK,"I bought this for my eldest son because of the movie's eccentric character (Michael Douglas), but especially because it involves a plot that takes place at Costco, one of my son and daughter-in-law's favorite haunts. :)",1378252800,,219,5.111111111111111

2966849,5,B000WCN8PK,"Just like the golden goose. Wich can make golden eggs as many that is possible. That's how this movie works. The more you watch it. The more golden moments you will find in it. I just love the part when he take forth his base and starts playing the really well mixed song flood of dreams on his porch. Just like that moment it is specked with alot of emotional scenes and ups and downs.
Just like life, but still manages to find that genuin dream of hope. A spectacular good performance from Michael Douglas as he mostly do I guess though. Evan Rachel Wood does also one of her best acting performances in this movie wich is easier I guess with a good script. To make alitle bit of negative critisism though, it does have alitle bit to easy bonding between father and daughter. Wich in the state they are in and the problems they face, should have alitle bit more drama and should try to resolve their previous problems that hasn't been resolved. Still though there's just so much a movie can actually bring to the table. So after all even with alitle bit of question marks on the emotional part of bounding it does fit into a problem filled duo. This duo gives humour and laughter but also other deep meaningful messages abroad for those with need of something more then the regular.
This is a golden goose. A movie to watch again and again.
I am not sure if I can pluck another egg to fill my basket, but I am sure I will try.

Now that her dad, who she calls Charlie is out, he becomes a disruptive part of her life. He has an idea of buried treasure and draws Miranda into his wild scheme.

Miranda is torn between wanting to believe in her father and the reality that he is not all there. The movie has occasional flashbacks to Miranda's less than normal childhood.  The film is a slow moving indie that is built upon the relationship and not the action.

For those who like well acted quirky indies with a ukelele soundtrack, this one is well worth a view.

Mr. Douglas yet again shows an interesting depth of craziness, this time, as an intense, bi-polar single dad. His obsession is fascinating without making you just wish it was over. And the balance of his McDonald's double-shift daughter was also enjoyable. She brought a simple, smart character to temper Douglas's mostly manic but ultimately sad role.

2966860,2,B000WCN8PK,"This film has a good story line and a great leading actor. This could have been a great film were it not for the budget, direction and writing. This is such a low-budget film that I suspect it was filmed in one or two weeks at most. Many of the scenes are skimmed over and left to a voice over to explain all the missing scenes. Michael Douglas does a very good job in his role, but he is a professional, who has been performing for many years. The other characters needed more direction but did not get it. Very little time was spent developing characters or plot. I think the primary problem with this film is the budget. I don't think the director or writer had time to develop the film due to time constraints as the film has the feel of being rushed.

This could still be a good film with the right personnel and budget but it will probably never be remade.",1338940800,,862,4.224242424242425

The plot is simple but throughout the entire movie you're left wondering... is it real, or is he crazy? You get many hints both ways during the ride.

The movie explores the strained relationship between father and daughter, and theirs is an especially broken one. Evan Rachel Wood and Micheal Douglas both do an outstanding job with their characters, and are thoroughly convincing. In fact, they make this movie what it is, something like this would have been easily botched by the wrong people, but they both hit it home.

2966862,5,B000WCN8PK,"This little film shows that great movies can be made on a shoestring.

(In the DVD commentary, the director/writer mentions that the couldn't afford a dog, so they wrote that character out.)

It's the story of a man (Michael Douglas) released from a mental institution who goes back to live with his 16-year-old daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).  Though Douglas is in his 50s or more, he is clearly the child of the pair, and Wood the parent.

Douglas blithely squanders what little they have (Wood works 2 shifts at McDonalds to make ends meet) to chase his crazy idea of Spanish doubloons buried in 1624.

Wood gets reluctantly sucked into the idea, and the plot takes wacky twists and turns.

Although it's a comedy, it's mostly a study of character and family--as well as the importance of dreams.

Douglas is wonderfully manic, and Wood is intriguing as the stoic, troubled, but changing Responsible One.",1310169600,,904,4.8311688311688314
2966863,3,B000WCN8PK,"If you are a dedicated fan of Michael Douglas, then you will probably get a kick out of this low-budget indie flick.

Douglas plays a scraggly-bearded nutcase newly released from a mental institution in Southern California.  During his incarceration, he had become fixated with the idea of finding a stash of old gold coins that had been hidden for hundreds of years.  He is gradually able to lure his teenage daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) into his quixotic quest for the treasure.

After very careful calculations, Douglas determines that the gold coins lie buried beneath the cement floor of a Costco.  He and his daughter hatch an improbable plan to retrieve the treasure.  We watch the two of them execute the plan and we don't really believe any of it for a moment, but it is entertaining to see it unfold.

This movie has a very uneven tone.  Some scenes are pretty funny and some scenes are rather grim and it doesn't all come together quite as well as it could have.  But there's never really a dull moment.  The acting is close to perfect.  The location filming adds a welcome verisimilitude.  It's a very pleasant movie to sit through.

Fans of Michael Douglas won't want to miss this one.  Everybody else may find enough to enjoy here that it will probably be a purchase they won't regret.",1296691200,,1298,4.6607929515418505

His teenage daughter, who has been taking care of herself since he was put away, wants to believe him, but has a hard time with the whole lost treasure premise, and her father's random night wanderings and quirky behavior. But as she is pulled further and further into her father's psychosis, we are pulled in along with her. It is a silly, twisted story, but sweet and tender at the same time and I have to admit, has a very funny and bizarre ending.

There's enough story to keep everyone coming back to watch more, but  at the same time, free to pop some corn, get some ice cream or use the facilities.

A delightful movie with Michael Douglas playing a completely unexpected role.  The film is a darkish comedy with heartwarming overtones.  Watching the Father/Daughter relationship grow  is worth more than the gold, supposidly buried under the local Costco, that Dad is planning on digging up.

This is a giggle picture, not a fall off your seat, hysterical fit type of comedy; but you'll be constantly entertained and still be able to use the bathroom without any danger.

2966867,5,B000WCN8PK,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The story and performances were funny and touching.  What I found interesting was the fact that there was really more than one story being told.  The obvious comedic one of the strained (at times) relationship between a ""nutty"" father and his daughter.  The 2nd story was slightly more subtle, and that was the State of California's fall from grace.

Michael Douglas' character is in pursuit of gold treasure, in the Golden State.  It's the dream that brought fame to California.  The journal of the Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Garces describes a wild, beautiful and intriguing land filled with possibility, as we hear of this great land we are treated to scenes of over-development, and strip malls.

The dream's been buried and replaced with the mundane, and yet crazy Charlie gets his daughter to start to believe in this dream, the California of old.

Father and daughter come together and realize their dreams and are richer for both what they share, and what they discover.

Although I'd give higher praise to Little Miss Sunshine, King of California deserves its own rays.

Michael Douglas got top billing, but it is really Evan Rachel Wood (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-in-the-Valley/dp/B000GDH9NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down in the Valley</a>) who's the star. We begin and end the film with her, and it is her performance as the teenage Miranda that strikes the strongest chord. Don't get me wrong, I'm not taking anything away from Douglas' manic performance; he did it very well, and it was nice to see him in a not-so-serious role. But Wood pulls off an incredibly strong spot alongside Douglas, and she did it effortlessly.

We have, however, seen this type of set-up before: reversing the roles of responsible adult to that of the child while the irresponsible one is the parent. It's an old Hollywood plot but one that can be used to great advantage if done right. And relative unknown writer/director Mike Cahill (best known for his visual effects work on the CRITTERCAM TV series) does a fine job in giving us a story of touching simplicity and wacky humor.

The story starts out with Miranda (Wood) picking up her father Charlie (Douglas) at a mental hospital during his release. Having lived alone for quite some time, Miranda is a self-motivated woman, keeping up the family home on her own. Her mother (Charlie's ex) also ran away from home during one of Charlie's early mental meltdowns and left Miranda to fend for herself.

Hoping her father might be getting better, any possibility of normalcy is swept aside when Charlie immediately starts searching for a lost 17th century treasure supposedly buried in their now booming community of Santa Clarita, California. Grudgingly being dragged along during late night excursions (to check star alignments) and heat-of-the-day golf course spots, Miranda slowly comes to accept that this might be a good way to bond with her delusional father. But then the discovery that the lost treasure is hidden beneath the concrete foundation of a newly installed Costco seems to put a halt to their plans; but Charlie has no intentions of letting anything get in his way.

Miranda must come to grips with her father's need to connect with something in his life; something that makes his life have meaning. It is Charlie's (and Miranda's) slow realization that this meaning is each other, and this gives the film all of its successful, emotional heft.

Whether or not Charlie found the treasure and gave it to Miranda is irrelevant (as we never see the treasure ...even though it is heavily alluded to). Perhaps the gold wasn't there, perhaps it was. Or maybe -- just maybe -- the gold resides elsewhere, meaning that a connection between father and daughter matters more than any metal.",1227657600,,3172,5.346693386773547

2966877,5,B000WCN8PK,"Michael Douglas (Charlie) and Evan Rachel Wood (Miranda) both give sterling performances in this quirky, funny and heart warming tale of a schizophrenic father (Douglas). Miranda, ""always the responsible one in the family"" becomes involved in the wildest scheme he has yet devised: finding the treasure of a Spanish Padre buried circa 1624 in a water cave which now is located beneath a Costco's.

Miranda, 15 years old when Charlie was institutionalized and now 17,  is slowly and irresistibly drawn into her father's scheming to find the treasure, a quest which is guided by the diary of the Spanish Padre across a golf course, construction sites, a grass farm to name a few places and ultimately Costco's where Miranda takes a job giving samples of chowder so she can case the place.

The ending is rather surprising and satisfying as Miranda finally finds out that here father is not simply disturbed, and a burden, but in the end does something that is kind, generous and very fatherly in the best sense.

I might note that this is the most heavily ""Brand Name"" laden movie I have ever seen. McDonald's, Phillips, Makita, Applebie's, Costco, Coca Cola, and many other cooperate titles or brand names are flashed. There was a time not so long ago that one never saw a brand name on the screen. Directors even went to great lengths to hide them. I did find this using of a fine movie to raise our awareness of Corporate names distracting.

2966878,4,B000WCN8PK,"....and find an old dream underneath waiting to resurface.

This bittersweet film about a madman and his long-suffering daughter takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing ""development"" (ecological destruction) of Southern California, forcing the viewer to wonder: Who are the truly insane in this film?

A lot of humor goes with this grim implication (the scene with the cop on the golf course is hilarious, if short; the filmmakers also shot a funny golf course scene for SIDEWAYS). I also liked the McDonald's shift manager looking over Miranda's shoulder to make sure she assembled a quarter cheese correctly--this actually happened to me when I was sixteen, working in a Southern California franchise. Some things never change. Miranda and her father stand in for everyone who tries but fails to live in peace with the standardization and industrialization going on all around them.

They also have whatever it takes to ""follow your bliss"" and try to find some sense of meaning in an increasingly orderly and planned and therefore quite insane urbanized landscape literally covering over the once-verdant earth walked by the so-called savages who appreciated and tended it.

Incidentally, although shot as a romp about a parentified daughter trying to give her bipolar father a sense of purpose, the film bears out what I've written about in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-California-Images-and-Ironies-of-Cross-and-Sword-on-El-Camino-Real/dp/0595514626/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep California: Images and Ironies of Cross and Sword on El Camino Real</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terrapsychology-Reengaging-The-Soul-Of-Place/dp/1882670655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terrapsychology: Reengaging The Soul Of Place</a>: what happens to traumatize a colonized and paved-over place never goes away until we find some way to heal the recurring themes by understanding them and reshaping them from within them. Costco and McDonald's are but commercialized and updated missions to convert the locals to a globalized existence that eats their souls and landscapes. The counter-mission resides in the loving heart pursuing its dreams or helping others to, as well-named Miranda does in this Californian tempest.

p.s. For those of you with some knowledge of California history: yes, you're right: no Spanish expeditions during the 1620s. After Cabrillo had been by, landing his ships but making no tours through California, Vizcaino did another sail-by in 1602. After that, no known Spanish incursions came through the state until 1769, when Junipero Serra and his merry band came colonizing. ""Santa Clarita"" got its name from the river they named ""Santa Clara"" as they marched through. Incidentally, Miranda's mission history lesson was correct, and not only for the Chumash of the Central Coast: most of the Indians who entered the missions never came out again.

p.p.s. The part about how California got its name is true. The bestseller Miranda refers to was called THE EXPLOITS OF ESPLANDIAN. The author's name was Montalvo. He died just before it got into print.",1218931200,,3181,5.919389978213507

2966884,5,B000WCN8PK,"I have inadvertently become an Evan Rachel Wood fan. I have seen her in ""Thirteen"", ""Pretty Persuasion"", and now ""King of California"". Her performances in all three films are well beyond girls of her age. Michael Douglas is in the same form that made ""Romancing the Stone"" such a hit. He does not disappoint here, either.

What do you do, when you are a girl who has had to work two jobs, fit only for girls of that tender age of sixteen, just to pay the bills left behind by a) A mother who is an anal ""hand-model"" that deserts her family because b) Your father is a mental case just released from a sanitarium, and will now live with you? Well, that question is answered in this somewhat dark comedy. The histories of both Charlie (Michael Douglas), and Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood), his daughter, are shown in ""flashback"" fashion throughout the film, so you pretty much know what drives Charlie to do some of the things he does, and how Miranda has had to cope with two dysfunctional parents.

The center of Charlie's seeming delusion is what drives this film, and with it, the method of Charlie's madness. All of the weird things Miranda had to deal with as a child, and now young adult, become clear, as she comes to the realization of how much her father REALLY loved her.

Evan Rachel Wood just keeps getting better at her craft. I can't wait to see what she does next! Here is an actor to look out for! Michael Douglas, well, he's a chip off the old block, alright! His father Kirk would be proud! I've seen him in just about everything except Science Fiction, and he is an extremely competent actor. These two mesh well together, in this film.

Michael Douglas is excellent as the wildly eccentric Charlie. There is a mischievous glint in his eyes when he feels like he is getting closer to the treasure. The older Douglas gets and the more films he does, the more comfortable an actor he becomes. He delivers a nuanced performance that never veers off into showy scenery-chewing territory. With his mountain man beard, Douglas certainly looks the part of an ex-mental patient and, at times, seems to be channeling Jeff Bridges in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000A7DVR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>.

Evan Rachel Wood plays Charlie's extremely patient daughter and narrator of this unusual tale and so, naturally, our sympathies lie with her because she's, y'know, the sane voice of reason. Miranda is the responsible one to Charlie's childish antics. Wood is the ideal foil to Douglas, the straight man to his kooky eccentric.

King of California belongs to Douglas and the film sinks of swims based on how well he sells his character's mad quest - kind of like Robin Williams' traumatized bum in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fisher-King/dp/0767811089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fisher King</a>. And while Mike Cahill is no Terry Gilliam, Douglas is more than up for taking on this wild ride with the charisma to draw us in, much like Charlie convinces Miranda to follow him.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Mike Cahill, cinematographer Jim Whitaker, production designer Dan Bishop and first assistant director Richard L. Fox. Cahill talks about how a lack of money forced him to rewrite the opening scene and improve on it. Everyone takes turns pointing out the various locations used in the film which is as boring as it sounds. They also point out dry technical details like the wonders of colour timing. It's amazing that this commentary can be so dull with all of these skilled artists at hand but unfortunately this is the case.

2966893,4,B000WCN8PK,"KING OF CALIFORNIA may not break any records for innovation of thought or script but it is a tightly made little film that allows veteran actor Michael Douglas a lollipop of a wacky role to remind us that he does have comedic talent!  It also gives 20-year old Evan Rachel Wood the opportunity to compete with a Pro and come out an equal - quite a feat for such a young actress.  Written and directed by Mike Cahill the story does have appeal, especially since it is set in Santa Clarita, California, a rapidly developing 'hinterland' that is suffering from the effects of too rapid industrialization, changing from a picturesque remnant of California raw beauty into yet another perky little town.

Charlie (Michael Douglas) has been in and out of mental institutions for his wacky behavior.  His life as a jazz bassist and entrepreneur has always veered off the map, leaving him alone with his only daughter Miranda who has survived her father's irresponsible life by keeping the old family home (in the midst of a huge housing development) with the money she makes double shifting  at the local MacDonalds.  When Charlie is released his focus is on discovering the gold left behind by Catholic priests in the mid 1600s, a fact he has researched while hospitalized, on the Internet, and from the journal of one of the priests. Miranda slowly buys into Charlie's madcap scheme and adventure as a gold hunter and the caper results in a bonding between father and daughter that has been teetering on the brink of disaster for years.  The manner in which Charlie, Miranda, and an old ex-con friend  Pepper (Willis Burks II) go after the treasure provides most of the energy of the film.

Yes, there are bits and pieces of this project that have been done many times before (and often better), but the pleasure of KING OF CALIFORNIA lies in the bravura and touching performances by Douglas and Wood.

Kind of California is another one of those films, but after watching this great little gem of a film, I realized it really doesn't matter if this film is more of an indy flick or a Hollywood flick... in the end, when the movie is this good, who cares?

Michael Douglas, in real life a pillar of Hollywood Establishment, in this fiction gets to play Charlie, a misunderstood, bipolar, irresponsible, outsider visionary in bland SoCal America.  (Think of his Wonder Boys role, reprised with a questionable sanity twist.)  As Charlie pursues his quest for the treasure of a long-dead Spanish missionary, we learn for the umpteenth time from Hollywood that convenience food and big box stores have polluted the land (but Hollywood gladly accepts their product placement fees), that the people who work in them are unpleasant or lecherous and look bad in bathing suits, that police are fat and/or dimwitted (except for the hot babe who picks up on Charlie's clever stratagem of leaving his telephone number in the hood of her cruiser), and that subdivisions existing where orange groves used to be is bad.

Tells the story of Miranda and Charlie.

Miranda is a sturdy, grounded, hard working teenager. Forced to give up high school in order to make ends meet - life now consists of her fast food job and maintaing the family home. Growing up quickly when her parents split up, that process sped up considerably when her father began showing signs of mental illness, culminating in a terrifying suicide attempt in which she saved his life.

She's pretty much been on her own since entering her teens.

Her dad is Charlie. And Charlie is bipolar. A condition that gets complicated when adding weed and/or alcohol into the mix. However, other than making him more distracted than usual, he's mostly harmless. Making his way through life as a part-time jazz musician and who knows what else - Miranda only sees him intermittently; sometimes a long time will pass before getting ""the phone call"".

Despite their fractured relationship - it's clear they love one another very much. Each is the only other family they have.

One day, five months prior to the present, the call is made. A request to retrieve him from yet another extended stay at a state hospital. It's the first time she's seen him in two years.

The last time was when she was 15.

After a bumpy reunion, as each has to get used to one another's presence, Charlie informs her that he has a new goal in life. He's embarking on his last great adventure - uncovering a Spanish treasure lost for more than three centuries.

And he wants her to come along.

It's clear he's still unstable; his release premature. Miranda can only hope he doesn't get into too much trouble. But as he begins to show signs that his condition is worsening, she becomes deeply torn about what to do. Her life, while far from ideal, was at least manageable. With her dad in the picture, it's quickly spiraling toward the toilet. And she's not willing to give up everything she's achieved just to facilitate his gentle madness.

But Charlie, in his own frantic, bumbling, barely coherent attempts to explain his reasoning - actually gets Miranda to listen. Really listen.

And now she's beginning to wonder if she's crazy too.

The overuse of flashbacks and some awkward editing aside, 'King' is an engaging, funny, and poignant film.

Internally debated making a statement like that for a performer whose incredible career is both notable and lengthy. But I'm comfortable with it now. Barring some kind of unexpected twilight performance - this will always be tops in my book when considering Michael Douglas, the actor.

In his role as Charlie, he delivered a pinnacled and nuanced form of the craft: Sensitive, insightful, suffering, angered, passionate, melancholy, introspective (a tough one to project on film), regret, humor, madness, and love. A genuine testament to the work of a master thespian.",1393113600,,3569,5.591836734693878

3201343,5,B000WCN8PK,"""But look at the world..."" says Charlie in reply to his daughter Miranda's accusation that he takes nothing seriously and views the world as existing simply for his amusement, in Mike Cahill's lyrical and nurturing masterpiece ""King of California"". The bi-polar Charlie is played by Michael Douglas and sixteen-year-old Miranda by Evan Rachel Wood. The story is told from the put-upon Miranda's point-of-view and supplemented with both her voiceover narration and the occasional flashback.

In the flashbacks a younger Miranda is convincingly played by a pre -""Sonny with a Chance"" Allisyn Ashley Arm. Arm was not just an excellent physical match for Wood, but a stylistic one as well; the two actresses share a non-verbal acting style,  gently teasing their portrayal of a character who does a whole lot of on-camera processing of her father's often baffling and exasperating antics. In several flashbacks single parent Charlie sends his nine-year-old daughter to school with a diorama of a California mission (presumably the one in San Fernando) they just constructed, littered with ""the bodies of the Chumash Indians, who died of Syphilis and Influenza, infected by the missionaries"".  The film's most visually compelling sequence is nine-year-old Miranda striding home hurt and angry after the diorama has landed her in trouble at school, betrayed by her father's poor judgement.

Charlie is obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried somewhere near their Santa Clarita Valley house. As Miranda reads the Torres journal in voiceover, she and Charlie retrace the path of his expedition across the valley in search of the treasure he buried. There is a political element to the story in the juxtaposing of descriptions of old California with images of the suburban sprawl that has obliterated much of the state's history. This is further illustrated by Miranda's adaptive qualities and Charlie's stubborn refusal to adapt; it is the only significant difference between the two characters and introduces a lot of poignancy into the story because the quality they admire the most in each other is the one they do not share.

For Miranda, having Charlie as a father is a Southern California version of ""Alice and Wonderland"".  Her self-reliant character is positioned midway between Alice and young heroine Jeliza-Rose in Terry Gilliam's Tideland (2005). And she shares many of their virtues; innocence, courage, curiosity, wonder, kindness, intelligence, courtesy, dignity, and a sense of justice. While she shares Alice's irritation with the rude and illogical situations they encounter in their respective wonderlands, she is considerably more adaptable. Alice was a confident and proper little Victorian girl who expected a certain standard of behavior, while Miranda and Jeliza Rose are skilled at making the best of a variety of sucky situations.

Physically Wood has never looked better, like Audrey Hepburn she is more dazzling with minimal makeup and everyday fashions - including a McDonald's uniform. She simply glows in the final sequence's extreme close-ups, standing on a bluff above the beach as she processes the predicted illegal landing of a group of Chinese boat people.  And in this moment she totally sells the story, which at its core is simply the story of a father and daughter with a unqualified love for each other.  Interestingly, Wood is so effective in this final sequence that she turns what in normal screenplay structure would be the aftermath, into the film's climatic moment; then they go out with the credits.

Just like that moment it is specked with alot of emotional scenes and ups and downs.
Just like life, but still manages to find that genuin dream of hope. A spectacular good performance from Michael Douglas as he mostly do I guess though. Evan Rachel Wood does also one of her best acting performances in this movie wich is easier I guess with a good script. To make alitle bit of negative critisism though, it does have alitle bit to easy bonding between father and daughter. Wich in the state they are in and the problems they face, should have alitle bit more drama and should try to resolve their previous problems that hasn't been resolved. Still though there's just so much a movie can actually bring to the table. So after all even with alitle bit of question marks on the emotional part of bounding it does fit into a problem filled duo. This duo gives humour and laughter but also other deep meaningful messages abroad for those with need of something more then the regular.

Miranda is torn between wanting to believe in her father and the reality that he is not all there. The movie has occasional flashbacks to Miranda's less than normal childhood.  The film is a slow moving indie that is built upon the relationship and not the action.

Michael Douglas does a very good job in his role, but he is a professional, who has been performing for many years. The other characters needed more direction but did not get it. Very little time was spent developing characters or plot. I think the primary problem with this film is the budget.

It's the story of a man (Michael Douglas) released from a mental institution who goes back to live with his 16-year-old daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).  Though Douglas is in his 50s or more, he is clearly the child of the pair, and Wood the parent.

Douglas blithely squanders what little they have (Wood works 2 shifts at McDonalds to make ends meet) to chase his crazy idea of Spanish doubloons buried in 1624.

Wood gets reluctantly sucked into the idea, and the plot takes wacky twists and turns.

Although it's a comedy, it's mostly a study of character and family--as well as the importance of dreams.

Douglas plays a scraggly-bearded nutcase newly released from a mental institution in Southern California.  During his incarceration, he had become fixated with the idea of finding a stash of old gold coins that had been hidden for hundreds of years.  He is gradually able to lure his teenage daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) into his quixotic quest for the treasure.

After very careful calculations, Douglas determines that the gold coins lie buried beneath the cement floor of a Costco.  He and his daughter hatch an improbable plan to retrieve the treasure.  We watch the two of them execute the plan and we don't really believe any of it for a moment, but it is entertaining to see it unfold.

This movie has a very uneven tone.  Some scenes are pretty funny and some scenes are rather grim and it doesn't all come together quite as well as it could have.  But there's never really a dull moment.  The acting is close to perfect.  The location filming adds a welcome verisimilitude.  It's a very pleasant movie to sit through.

The 2nd story was slightly more subtle, and that was the State of California's fall from grace.

Michael Douglas' character is in pursuit of gold treasure, in the Golden State.  It's the dream that brought fame to California.  The journal of the Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Garces describes a wild, beautiful and intriguing land filled with possibility, as we hear of this great land we are treated to scenes of over-development, and strip malls.

The dream's been buried and replaced with the mundane, and yet crazy Charlie gets his daughter to start to believe in this dream, the California of old.

Father and daughter come together and realize their dreams and are richer for both what they share, and what they discover.

Although I'd give higher praise to Little Miss Sunshine, King of California deserves its own rays.

Michael Douglas got top billing, but it is really Evan Rachel Wood (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-in-the-Valley/dp/B000GDH9NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down in the Valley</a>) who's the star. We begin and end the film with her, and it is her performance as the teenage Miranda that strikes the strongest chord. Don't get me wrong, I'm not taking anything away from Douglas' manic performance; he did it very well, and it was nice to see him in a not-so-serious role. But Wood pulls off an incredibly strong spot alongside Douglas, and she did it effortlessly.

We have, however, seen this type of set-up before: reversing the roles of responsible adult to that of the child while the irresponsible one is the parent. It's an old Hollywood plot but one that can be used to great advantage if done right. And relative unknown writer/director Mike Cahill (best known for his visual effects work on the CRITTERCAM TV series) does a fine job in giving us a story of touching simplicity and wacky humor.

The story starts out with Miranda (Wood) picking up her father Charlie (Douglas) at a mental hospital during his release. Having lived alone for quite some time, Miranda is a self-motivated woman, keeping up the family home on her own. Her mother (Charlie's ex) also ran away from home during one of Charlie's early mental meltdowns and left Miranda to fend for herself.

Hoping her father might be getting better, any possibility of normalcy is swept aside when Charlie immediately starts searching for a lost 17th century treasure supposedly buried in their now booming community of Santa Clarita, California. Grudgingly being dragged along during late night excursions (to check star alignments) and heat-of-the-day golf course spots, Miranda slowly comes to accept that this might be a good way to bond with her delusional father. But then the discovery that the lost treasure is hidden beneath the concrete foundation of a newly installed Costco seems to put a halt to their plans; but Charlie has no intentions of letting anything get in his way.

Miranda must come to grips with her father's need to connect with something in his life; something that makes his life have meaning. It is Charlie's (and Miranda's) slow realization that this meaning is each other, and this gives the film all of its successful, emotional heft.

Whether or not Charlie found the treasure and gave it to Miranda is irrelevant (as we never see the treasure ...even though it is heavily alluded to). Perhaps the gold wasn't there, perhaps it was. Or maybe -- just maybe -- the gold resides elsewhere, meaning that a connection between father and daughter matters more than any metal.",1227657600,,3172,5.346693386773547

3201374,5,B000WCN8PK,"Michael Douglas (Charlie) and Evan Rachel Wood (Miranda) both give sterling performances in this quirky, funny and heart warming tale of a schizophrenic father (Douglas). Miranda, ""always the responsible one in the family"" becomes involved in the wildest scheme he has yet devised: finding the treasure of a Spanish Padre buried circa 1624 in a water cave which now is located beneath a Costco's.

Miranda, 15 years old when Charlie was institutionalized and now 17,  is slowly and irresistibly drawn into her father's scheming to find the treasure, a quest which is guided by the diary of the Spanish Padre across a golf course, construction sites, a grass farm to name a few places and ultimately Costco's where Miranda takes a job giving samples of chowder so she can case the place.

The ending is rather surprising and satisfying as Miranda finally finds out that here father is not simply disturbed, and a burden, but in the end does something that is kind, generous and very fatherly in the best sense.

I might note that this is the most heavily ""Brand Name"" laden movie I have ever seen. McDonald's, Phillips, Makita, Applebie's, Costco, Coca Cola, and many other cooperate titles or brand names are flashed. There was a time not so long ago that one never saw a brand name on the screen. Directors even went to great lengths to hide them. I did find this using of a fine movie to raise our awareness of Corporate names distracting.

3201375,4,B000WCN8PK,"....and find an old dream underneath waiting to resurface.

This bittersweet film about a madman and his long-suffering daughter takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing ""development"" (ecological destruction) of Southern California, forcing the viewer to wonder: Who are the truly insane in this film?

A lot of humor goes with this grim implication (the scene with the cop on the golf course is hilarious, if short; the filmmakers also shot a funny golf course scene for SIDEWAYS). I also liked the McDonald's shift manager looking over Miranda's shoulder to make sure she assembled a quarter cheese correctly--this actually happened to me when I was sixteen, working in a Southern California franchise. Some things never change. Miranda and her father stand in for everyone who tries but fails to live in peace with the standardization and industrialization going on all around them.

They also have whatever it takes to ""follow your bliss"" and try to find some sense of meaning in an increasingly orderly and planned and therefore quite insane urbanized landscape literally covering over the once-verdant earth walked by the so-called savages who appreciated and tended it.

Incidentally, although shot as a romp about a parentified daughter trying to give her bipolar father a sense of purpose, the film bears out what I've written about in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-California-Images-and-Ironies-of-Cross-and-Sword-on-El-Camino-Real/dp/0595514626/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep California: Images and Ironies of Cross and Sword on El Camino Real</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terrapsychology-Reengaging-The-Soul-Of-Place/dp/1882670655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terrapsychology: Reengaging The Soul Of Place</a>: what happens to traumatize a colonized and paved-over place never goes away until we find some way to heal the recurring themes by understanding them and reshaping them from within them. Costco and McDonald's are but commercialized and updated missions to convert the locals to a globalized existence that eats their souls and landscapes. The counter-mission resides in the loving heart pursuing its dreams or helping others to, as well-named Miranda does in this Californian tempest.

p.s. For those of you with some knowledge of California history: yes, you're right: no Spanish expeditions during the 1620s. After Cabrillo had been by, landing his ships but making no tours through California, Vizcaino did another sail-by in 1602. After that, no known Spanish incursions came through the state until 1769, when Junipero Serra and his merry band came colonizing. ""Santa Clarita"" got its name from the river they named ""Santa Clara"" as they marched through. Incidentally, Miranda's mission history lesson was correct, and not only for the Chumash of the Central Coast: most of the Indians who entered the missions never came out again.

p.p.s. The part about how California got its name is true. The bestseller Miranda refers to was called THE EXPLOITS OF ESPLANDIAN. The author's name was Montalvo. He died just before it got into print.",1218931200,,3181,5.919389978213507

3201381,5,B000WCN8PK,"I have inadvertently become an Evan Rachel Wood fan. I have seen her in ""Thirteen"", ""Pretty Persuasion"", and now ""King of California"". Her performances in all three films are well beyond girls of her age. Michael Douglas is in the same form that made ""Romancing the Stone"" such a hit. He does not disappoint here, either.

What do you do, when you are a girl who has had to work two jobs, fit only for girls of that tender age of sixteen, just to pay the bills left behind by a) A mother who is an anal ""hand-model"" that deserts her family because b) Your father is a mental case just released from a sanitarium, and will now live with you? Well, that question is answered in this somewhat dark comedy. The histories of both Charlie (Michael Douglas), and Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood), his daughter, are shown in ""flashback"" fashion throughout the film, so you pretty much know what drives Charlie to do some of the things he does, and how Miranda has had to cope with two dysfunctional parents.

The center of Charlie's seeming delusion is what drives this film, and with it, the method of Charlie's madness. All of the weird things Miranda had to deal with as a child, and now young adult, become clear, as she comes to the realization of how much her father REALLY loved her.

Evan Rachel Wood just keeps getting better at her craft. I can't wait to see what she does next! Here is an actor to look out for! Michael Douglas, well, he's a chip off the old block, alright! His father Kirk would be proud! I've seen him in just about everything except Science Fiction, and he is an extremely competent actor. These two mesh well together, in this film.

Michael Douglas is excellent as the wildly eccentric Charlie. There is a mischievous glint in his eyes when he feels like he is getting closer to the treasure. The older Douglas gets and the more films he does, the more comfortable an actor he becomes. He delivers a nuanced performance that never veers off into showy scenery-chewing territory. With his mountain man beard, Douglas certainly looks the part of an ex-mental patient and, at times, seems to be channeling Jeff Bridges in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000A7DVR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>.

Evan Rachel Wood plays Charlie's extremely patient daughter and narrator of this unusual tale and so, naturally, our sympathies lie with her because she's, y'know, the sane voice of reason. Miranda is the responsible one to Charlie's childish antics. Wood is the ideal foil to Douglas, the straight man to his kooky eccentric.

King of California belongs to Douglas and the film sinks of swims based on how well he sells his character's mad quest - kind of like Robin Williams' traumatized bum in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fisher-King/dp/0767811089/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fisher King</a>. And while Mike Cahill is no Terry Gilliam, Douglas is more than up for taking on this wild ride with the charisma to draw us in, much like Charlie convinces Miranda to follow him.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Mike Cahill, cinematographer Jim Whitaker, production designer Dan Bishop and first assistant director Richard L. Fox. Cahill talks about how a lack of money forced him to rewrite the opening scene and improve on it. Everyone takes turns pointing out the various locations used in the film which is as boring as it sounds. They also point out dry technical details like the wonders of colour timing. It's amazing that this commentary can be so dull with all of these skilled artists at hand but unfortunately this is the case.

3201390,4,B000WCN8PK,"KING OF CALIFORNIA may not break any records for innovation of thought or script but it is a tightly made little film that allows veteran actor Michael Douglas a lollipop of a wacky role to remind us that he does have comedic talent!  It also gives 20-year old Evan Rachel Wood the opportunity to compete with a Pro and come out an equal - quite a feat for such a young actress.  Written and directed by Mike Cahill the story does have appeal, especially since it is set in Santa Clarita, California, a rapidly developing 'hinterland' that is suffering from the effects of too rapid industrialization, changing from a picturesque remnant of California raw beauty into yet another perky little town.

Charlie (Michael Douglas) has been in and out of mental institutions for his wacky behavior.  His life as a jazz bassist and entrepreneur has always veered off the map, leaving him alone with his only daughter Miranda who has survived her father's irresponsible life by keeping the old family home (in the midst of a huge housing development) with the money she makes double shifting  at the local MacDonalds.  When Charlie is released his focus is on discovering the gold left behind by Catholic priests in the mid 1600s, a fact he has researched while hospitalized, on the Internet, and from the journal of one of the priests. Miranda slowly buys into Charlie's madcap scheme and adventure as a gold hunter and the caper results in a bonding between father and daughter that has been teetering on the brink of disaster for years.  The manner in which Charlie, Miranda, and an old ex-con friend  Pepper (Willis Burks II) go after the treasure provides most of the energy of the film.

Yes, there are bits and pieces of this project that have been done many times before (and often better), but the pleasure of KING OF CALIFORNIA lies in the bravura and touching performances by Douglas and Wood.

Kind of California is another one of those films, but after watching this great little gem of a film, I realized it really doesn't matter if this film is more of an indy flick or a Hollywood flick... in the end, when the movie is this good, who cares?

Beyond that, King of California has nothing to recommend it, least of all  an original thought for its entire running time.  Michael Douglas, in real life a pillar of Hollywood Establishment, in this fiction gets to play Charlie, a misunderstood, bipolar, irresponsible, outsider visionary in bland SoCal America.  (Think of his Wonder Boys role, reprised with a questionable sanity twist.)  As Charlie pursues his quest for the treasure of a long-dead Spanish missionary, we learn for the umpteenth time from Hollywood that convenience food and big box stores have polluted the land (but Hollywood gladly accepts their product placement fees), that the people who work in them are unpleasant or lecherous and look bad in bathing suits, that police are fat and/or dimwitted (except for the hot babe who picks up on Charlie's clever stratagem of leaving his telephone number in the hood of her cruiser), and that subdivisions existing where orange groves used to be is bad.  Unfortunately, after the viewer has taken the necessary thirty seconds to ingest those insights, Charlie, in full, wild beard of course, still has many minutes to lumber along the screen to his destiny in the awful society that doesn't appreciate him.

Instead of King, pay another visit to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which - in case any viewer on the planet overlooked the obvious link to that classic - the movie kindly drives it home by having Wood reading Sometimes a Great Notion in one scene.",1190851200,,1684,4.992857142857143
