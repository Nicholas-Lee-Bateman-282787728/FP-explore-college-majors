In this volume, the dynamic duo of Chichay and Joaquin now have another obstacle to deal with: Joaquin's grandfather...the head of San Juan Group of Companies and he will do anything to separate them. To avoid his family from further heartache, Chichay's dad moves his family to the province and Chichay can't tell Joaquin about it. Will this be the end of the magic of Joaquin and Chichay?

This dvd has its share of heartaches, but it still has a lot of light hearted moments that you want to watch over and over again.",1405728000,,788,4.542253521126761
