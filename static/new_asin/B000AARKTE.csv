8077346,5,B000AARKTE,BraceFace - A great show that needs to have the ENTIRE series put into a box set uncensored and with all episodes! It was a great series that was shown on ABC/FOX Family back in the early 2000's and was great; I was a teen back then and it was a lot more realistic than a lot of other shows out there. This set I purchased barely used - it was in fine condition (the seller was awesome). It has the first 13 episodes to the show; it was a good buy. Takes me back to being 12/13/14 years old again! :),1429920000,,500,3.911764705882353

8077349,5,B000AARKTE,Both me and my daughter love Braceface.  I wish that it was televised here in our state.  We need more shows like this for children to enjoy.  Most episodes have some kind of meaning to it. We just love it.,1239926400,,206,4.1

8077351,5,B000AARKTE,"Braceface may be a pretty average looking show, but its outlook is just wonderful. This series doesn't avoid the real issues of growing up and explores them in a very honest, thoughtful manner, following the life of 13 year old Sharon Spitz. This first batch of episodes contains the reprocussions of Sharon's first peroid, her parents' divorce, a friend who shoplifts and the dangers of joyriding.

Before any parents start panicking about the subject matter, the morals of the show are in exactly the right place and it creates an environment where such issues can be discussed and mistakes can be learned from, rather than swept under the carpet. I wish there were shows this direct and genuine when I was younger.

This series only gets better with time and will likely never get a complete screening in America - most of those episodes I mentioned have been skipped over in the Disney Channel screenings, as if they are afraid of even mentioning that kids encounter such issues in modern life. It is exactly this sort of progressive attitude that encourages kids to make up their own minds about society, rather than being wrapped in cotton wool and unprepared when confronted with the reality of teenage life further down the line.

If you are even slightly curious about this show, check out this first season and encourage further releases. If this show can air uncensored on children's TV in Canada to acclaim and affection why should American audiences not be able to cope with it?!!",1129939200,11,1493,4.847058823529411
8077352,5,B000AARKTE,"Like the other reviewer I used to watch this (and taped most of the episodes ABC Family showed). As well as having gotten the previous DVDs. But am going to get this set, in hopes that they'll continue; and put out the whole series -- including the episodes that didn't air here in the US, thanks to ABC Family dropping the show!!

  ** A little FYI for those that might not know, have seen on an official site the series has 78 episodes to it (of which the US got 41).",1129593600,5,469,4.131868131868132
8077353,4,B000AARKTE,"There is a good thing and a bad thing about this boxed set. The good thing is that it has the first 13 episodes of the first season in 2001. The bad thing is that it is the episodes already released on the other single DVD's, with the exception of the last 4 episodes that are exclusive to this DVD. If Braceface fans want to see the remainder of season one on DVD and the unreleased season two episodes released, this is a must-have then because the other seasons aren't coming to DVD unless this boxed set sells good. I would definitely buy this set, even though I have the complete series taped from when it used to air on ABC Family, I am still going to buy this. Hope it sells good!",1126051200,8,687,4.172932330827067
