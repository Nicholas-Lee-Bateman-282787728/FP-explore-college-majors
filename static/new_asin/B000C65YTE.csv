2453139,3,B000C65YTE,"The series Missing (2003-06), was a Canadian/American production that aired in the US on the Lifetime cable network.  Based on characters created by author Meg Cabot, the series was originally called 1-800-MISSING, and was renamed Missing, for the second season, when the show went through a major makeover.

Introduced in the first season, Jess Mastriani is a woman with psychic abilities, who aided the FBI in their investigations.  Caterina Scorsone (Edge of Darkness, Alice), plays Mastriani, who returns in season two as a qualified FBI agent.  The FBI agents in the missing person's task force, that Mastriani worked with in the first season, have been completely replaced.  Mastriani is partnered with special agent Nicole Scott (Vivica A. Fox).  Also on the staff are assistant director John Pollock (Justin Louis), and special agent Antonio Cortez (Mark Consuelos).

Season two (2004-05) is a fresh start, and early on the show exhibits some growing pains, as veteran agent Scott, has to come to terms with Mastriani and her psychic abilities.  As time goes on, the two women, who come from very different backgrounds, develop a working relationship.  Both have to deal with director Pollock, who is basically a dick most of the time.

The program is somewhat reminiscent of the NBC program Profiler (1996-2000), which also featured a character with psychic abilities, providing aid to a law enforcement agency.  CBS's Criminal Minds (2005-2010) featuring FBI agents that intercede in local situations, is another similar program.  Crime procedurals of this type, typically stretch the limits of credibility, as the viewer is asked to believe that an outside agency, is able to come into a situation, with no knowledge of the local conditions, pick up clues, and within a hour, wrap up the case.  To some degree, these credibility issues are present in Missing.  Back in the office, Cortez is often the source of divine wisdom, who can get critical information with just a few keystrokes.  This device has now become an overused clich, in these kind of programs.  Mastriani's visions are often quite dramatic, with cryptic or symbolic meanings, that require interpretation or deciphering.  No matter how outrageous, the validity of these visions is not questioned.  While often critical, the psychic element is kind of downplayed, with solid investigative work being how cases are usually solved.

From standard missing person's cases, to elaborate criminal schemes, the writers try to keep things from being too mundane.  While often not that credible, heavy on the gunplay, and with too many last second rescues, the cases feature some intriguing situations, a healthy amount of violence, a high body count, and some messy endings.  The series is a breakout role for Caterina Scorsone, who has since proven to be quite a talented actress.  Vivica A. Fox is good in a serious role, as her character is confident, street smart, with something of a chip on her shoulder.  Fox is pretty good in fights scenes.

Featuring two attractive female leads, the second season of Wanted contains sixteen exciting episodes, and is a pretty good value for those looking  for a fairly entertaining crime drama, with decent production values.",1274572800,11,3236,5.1888246628131025

2453153,5,B000C65YTE,"""Missing"" Season 2 became available in January 2006.  These are the 2004 episodes. There are 18 episodes on four discs. Each episode is 42 minutes. So far i have watched the discs 1 & 2. This is a fine series with a great cast with gifted writing and direction! Justin Louis owns his role as Assistant Director of FBI,""John Pollock"".  Excellent acting is by Agents ""Nicole Scott""(Vivica A.Fox), Caterina Scorsone as ""Jess Mastriani"", and Mark Consuelos as ""Antonio Cortez"".Of course in the real world cases are not so quickly and neatly wrapped up on demand as seen here. But if I could  own only one TV series, i would choose Missing, even over House MD, and West Wing! Season 3 is scheduled to begin airing on 1-1-2007...so apparently patience is in order.

MISSING [TV Series]

Based on a series of novels by Meg Cabot, the weekly cop series 1-800-Missing was a workaday police drama with a psychic -- and feminist -- slant. Gloria Reuben, formerly a regular on ER and The Agency, starred as ambitious FBI agent Brooke Haslett, assigned to the Bureau's missing-persons division. Much to her surprise, Brooke's ""find"" record improved immensely when she began working in concert with Jess Mastriani (Caterina Scorsone), a young woman who had developed psychic powers after being struck by lightning. (In the books, Jess was a teenager; in the series, she was 21.) Adhering to the tradition established by The X-Files, the pragmatic and skeptical Brooke did not always see eye to eye with the ethereal true believer Jess, but one could not argue about the successful results of their teaming. 1-800-Missing debuted August 2, 2003, on the Lifetime network. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide
