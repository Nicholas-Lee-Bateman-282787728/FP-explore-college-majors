8085984,5,B000BF73YU,"I purchased this film on CD after owning it on VHS for many years.  Cocteau's inventive methods in an age before cheap Pixar/Manga foolishness is nothing short of remarkable.  The video and audio quality is terrific; mine was made in Korea with Korean language notes on the box!  Juliette Greco, of whom I'm a real fan, is in this film at a very young age, already very sexy.  Jean Marais is classically handsome as always.

This adaptation of the myth is unique and will be a treat, both visually and artistically, to the uninitiated.",1216425600,,535,4.648936170212766
8085985,4,B000BF73YU,"I saw this movie for the first time recently, and I loved it.  Those who are familiar with the traditional telling of the myth might be a little confused at first, as I was, but once things get started, the differences between the telling and the modern take seem very appropriate and even necessary for relating to a modern audience.  Cocteau makes these characters caught in the ancient Greek myth into real people with real problems.  I was impressed especially with the use of the mirrors; the reflections of the characters and its use as the portal to the world behind are both thought-provoking and help to update the myth very effectively into the twentieth century.  Cocteau managed to pull off a special effect with the mirrors that is more successful using his method than it would be today using computer tricks, though probably safer.  It would also be helpful to have read the play (also by Cocteau) that the film is based off of, if only to have a better understanding of why the characters are the way they are.  Cocteau explains his motives more in the directions in the play as to its adaptation to the times.  Both the play and the movie are well worth the time and give you a brand-new perspective on the ancient myth of the grieving Orpheus who loses his wife to the underworld twice.",1193356800,2,1304,4.594827586206897
8085986,5,B000BF73YU,"This is one of my favorite films. Very surrealistic, but an original slant on the classic Orpheus. Entertaining special effects. Great romance which includes sacrifice.",1170720000,,168,5.76
