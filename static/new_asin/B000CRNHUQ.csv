8101094,5,B000CRNHUQ,"This is one of the really great movies that is so well written, acted, and directed, that it didn't have to be high budget. Besides being a heart warming story, it teaches a skill that can change a persons life. I have a child (now grown up) that was a stutterer. He learned the technique to conquer stuttering. I hadn't watched it since he was a boy and it is still as great as I remembered it.
Don't just consider it a movie about stuttering. It is funny, enjoyable, romantic, and everything else a great movie should be.
My highest recommendation.",1354838400,,550,4.455445544554456
8101095,3,B000CRNHUQ,"This is a sweet, if dated and slightly corny, film about behaviorally oriented stuttering therapy. Austin Pendleton was (and I suppose remains) a real-life stutterer who went through therapy similar to that depicted in the film.

I wish the film had extrapolated more on the therapy techniques used to treat stutterers. A moving and tearful speech made by Dan Shor's character Julian near the end would have been even more effective if we had seen some of his breakthroughs. But for a low-budget venture produced by the Hollins Communications Research Institute--a mirror image of the institute depicted in the film--Talk to Me serves as a touching and educational account of stuttering therapy in the early 80's.",1262908800,,713,5.146551724137931
8101096,4,B000CRNHUQ,"This is a very touching movie about a man who stutters and goes to a treatment center to overcome the problem.  It has a 1970s look and a ""made for television"" look.  I guess you'd call that low production values.  Entertaining nevertheless, probably more so for someone who can relate to the subject matter.",1250726400,,308,4.666666666666667
