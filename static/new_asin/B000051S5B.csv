1386819,2,B000051S5B,The first movie wasn't fantastic but it had way more going for it then this one does. For one it's funny and even though it's bad the movie it's enjoyable to watch. This movie is probley the worst horror movie I've ever seen bad cgi you never see the snowman but maybe the last 30 minutes and then the acting is just humilating If I was an actress involved in this movie I'd be embarrassed to put it on paper. They were suppose to make a sequel to follow up this one and thank god they didn't. I've seen plenty of cult films that were semi bad but never this bad. Watch killer klownz from outerspace if u want a cult horror movie,1361491200,,629,4.121951219512195
1386820,2,B000051S5B,"Jack's back, and this time, he's brought along his mini-mutant snowball offspring to wreak havoc on the tropical island paradise where Sheriff Tiler has decided to hold his second honeymoon! Michael Cooney trades in what little seriousness the original had left for a tongue-in-cheek schlocker in JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN. The title should say it all, but JACK does not disappoint when it comes to absurd humor and outrageous gore! Jack's terrible one-liners have come back with a vengeance, but with them comes an increased special effects budget that allows him to kill off the islanders in all sorts of wacky ways. From turning into a giant snow anvil and smooshing people to launching deadly icicles or exploding people's heads, his new range of weaponry quickly racks up the body count. Though the plot and characters are absolutely ridiculous, they are clearly meant to be. Cooney only aims to entertain, and as terrible as the film truly is, it is sure to please fans of other awful Slasher like... well... JACK FROST!

1386824,2,B000051S5B,"""Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman"" is a film that definitely needs to be viewed in the spirit in which it was intended to achieve any kind of satisfaction for audience members. Let's get this out of the way first: it's not a horror film as much as it's an attempt at comedy, though the comedy is often meager and the production values are terrible. The concept is weaker than the original, and the acting and script are frequently poor. This is a film that, if it is to be enjoyed at all, must be viewed through the lens of the bad movie aficionado, preferably in the company of other B-movie lovers. Even then, though, this film can be a tough slog at times.

With subplots about talking carrots, fanged snowballs, shape-shifting water beings, and ice creatures that can't melt in the tropics, it's clear that this is shaky material, but it really falls down in the execution: the script is not funny, and the one-liners from the evil sentient snowman are less amusing than corny this time around. Director (and writer) Michael Cooney exploits water in all its forms (talking ice cubes, falling ice anvils, snowball waffles, etc.) to the maximum effect, but underlying the alleged hilarity is a concept that does not succeed on many levels. Here Christopher Allport is Sheriff Sam Tiler, haunted by his previous encounter with Jack Frost. In an attempt to escape his demons he takes his wife Anne (Eileen Seeley) and friends on a tropical vacation where evil talking snowmen couldn't possibly exist. Of course, you know that all is possible in B-movie comedy-dramas, and after some introductory experimentation, the melt-proof Jack Frost shows up to haunt the island. The rest of the movie revolves around defeating this indefatigable snowman (laser sighted super soakers full of antifreeze no longer hack it) and his evil snowball spawn. (The less said about the special effects, the better: the talking snowballs in particular are very challenging to take seriously as a threat, but this is comedy remember.) After much drama including the throwing of frying pans (really?) and vacuum cleaner theatrics, the CGI and puppet menace is vanquished (unless there is a ""Jack Frost 3."")

This film looks relentlessly cheap, and the video quality is terrible; the net effect is tedium interspersed with a rare giggle. The packaging is nice, but don't be deceived: you can't judge a book by its cover and neither can you gauge a film by its DVD case. Perhaps some fans of the first movie will enjoy the sequel, but from concept to final production, this is strictly enjoyable only for camp value, and even that is pretty limited.",1333843200,4,2641,4.853658536585366

Jack Frost 2 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't waste your time or your money. Imagine if the creators of Full House tried to make a horror movie on a budget of 500 dollars. This is important too: if you're the kind of person who gets angry when you watch really atrocious movies then avoid Jack Frost 2 because it is one of the most incompetent films I've ever personally witnessed.",1320278400,2,563,4.371428571428571
1386827,4,B000051S5B,"The movie is more comedy than slasher horror, perhaps more in the same light as ""Student Bodies."" Christopher Allport plays Sheriff Sam Tiler, who people don't believe about his killer snowman. The snowman has been revived and heads to a tropical island where Sam and his wife are vacationing. Jack Frost has the ability to change his shape. He talks the whole while, similar to the inane chatter of previously mentioned ""Student Bodies.""

The movie is fun and is more spoof on horror than horror itself. There is blood, killing, and some Troma style gore. A killer snow ball fight.

1386829,3,B000051S5B,"Many moons ago, when Sid was just a young elf, we came across a film sporting a very attractive holographic cover containing a killer snowman at our local video store. After reading the synopsis we knew we landed on a fine piece of b horror that just had to be done. Years later we decided to revisit the classic and unfortunately were a little let down. Most likely the disappointment of the first flick was due to a lack of our favorite movie enhancing substance, which we considered when it came to Jack Frost 2. Luckily with a little help from our friend this time around was much more enjoyable as Jack is back in full b style.

In our second Jack Frost installment Sheriff Sam Tiler, his wife Anne, and their two buddies decide to get away after their first encounter with the murderous styrofoam snowman. They decide to take a cruise to the Caribbean to realize there is no escape from b no matter where you go. Somehow Jack is able to make it to the islands and cruise around in liquid form doing his killings, despite the 90 degree weather. Eventually Jack freezes the island so he can assume full cheaply made snowman form and attempt to finish off the Sheriff and company. Naturally Sam conjures up another way to stop Mr. Frost for now. Hopefully someday soon they will pump out a third installment as the idea of a killer snowman just doesn't get old. It seems unlikely, but we can dream.

To sum it up Jack Frost 2 was very much enjoyed by the old boy Sid and took us back to the good times. There a certain films that have been viewed years ago and must be revisited now that we review everything. So be looking out for Uncle Sam and the Ice Cream Man in the very near future. As far as out feature flick we had a lot of fun watching it despite the fact it took 20 minutes to figure out how to get it working. Not to mention this was already our second bout with the dvd, but Sid came out victorious when he decided to pop it in the laptop. Thankfully it worked instead of being forced to watch the trailer over and over. To those out there looking for some low budget b horror fun, Jack Frost should do you good. This was certainly one enjoyed back in the glory days as much as it is today.",1250726400,,2206,4.262529832935561

1386847,2,B000051S5B,"I didn't even like Jack Frost part 1, but for some reason I thought I'd see how the sequel was, seeing as how some people said it's better then the original. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE ON ABOUT?????? Where we watching the same movie? I can barely remember JF1, but I know it wasn't as bad as this one.

PLOT: Jacks back. For reasons unknown, someone digs up the buried anti-freeze to runs tests. Jack seems to get revived when a janitor knocks coffee into a fish tank. Jack then escapes down the drain and out to sea. Then a guy from part 1 (I think, I cant remember it well enough to care) is still haunted by Jack, but him and the wife are going to Hawaii to their best friends wedding, who also go with them. Then Hawaii freezes over, the super-models need saving, the girls showing boobies get killed, and Jack frost ends up having kittens that are a BAD rip-off of Gremlins. They seem indestructible and they need to find something better then anti-freeze to stop Jack and the Jack-lens. (you'll laugh at what they use)

OVERALL: The film is horrible, yet funny, yet hard to watch, yet stupidly entertaining. The films shot on bad film... I don't know the name of it, but it looks like the same kind of lighting and sets and cameras they'd use on DAYS OF OUR LIVES.
The acting is super bad, the dialog is worse, the filming is worsen then that, and the ending is putrid.

I've seen far worse movies, but this one I can say; You might laugh at how cheesy it is, but don't expect it to be scary, it's not, it's a laughable stupid, badly done movie. I think they did that on purpose, but for what reason, I dunno.

Watch it if you need something to laugh at that's so bad, or enjoy C grade movies. Otherwise, don't bother.",1146009600,,1717,4.290123456790123

A killer snowman who melts and reappears where ever he wants to? There was some blood in this movie but that doesn't make this a horror movie by no means and doesn't make this movie any better.

1386849,5,B000051S5B,"First of all, let me just say that this movie can not be horror. It just can't. How can mutanat killer snowman be scary. I have no idea, and I also think the director  had no idea either. Like one reviewer said already, this movie is like an 8th grade video project.

This movie starts off when a stupid retard janitor with a dumb hat walks into this lab and starts to clean it when...... are you ready..........are you sure.......ok here it is.....

all of a sudden he knocks over some anti freeze collant stuff into this open container.  It then goes into this crappy special effect where it zooms in and shows him being transformed into the killer snowman.  At this point I, with my two other friends started bursting out laughing. At this point I knew that this movie would be very bad, but in a good, funny way.

I don't know why this got an R rating, it wasn't very gory. There was this one scene where Jack pulls out someones eyes, but they looked like white gumballs with ketchup on them. And Jack frosts' costume looks like the ones people wear at Disney World. But whatever. This can not be taken as a horror movie, and I don't know what they were thinking to ever even make this movie. Go rent this movie if you want to see some bad special effects( if you can even call them effects ) and poor acting. The only reason I give this 5 stars is because it was hilarious, and I still can't belive this movie even got made.",1137974400,,1429,4.274074074074074
1386850,2,B000051S5B,"This movie was never intended to be a horror/scary movie.  The filmmakers CLEARLY meant for it to be a campy, funny film, with a lot of humorous deaths along the way.  If you watch it with that in mind - NOT expecting anything truly scary - but just a disposable, kill-90-minutes-on-a-Saturday-afternoon movie.  The production values are nil, and the acting and script are unquestionably sub-par, but on that one certain level - that very specific level I mentioned previously - this movie actually has some funny scenes and isn't as bad as others have made it out to be.  The strongest point I can make is the one I made already: if you are looking for The Shining or Rosemary's Baby, this AIN'T it.  If you're bored or under the influence of something, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.  Looking for true scares?  Skip it.  Looking for a quality horror movie?  Skip it.  Looking to kill some time and maybe laugh a little, and lighten up a bit, you may want to at least give it a try.  I gave the one two stars, because one stars are really reserved for those films that intend to scare and pretend to deliver (if only through the box cover artwork and ""reviews"" from obscure online review sites) and really rip off the audience.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125705600,12,1494,4.448529411764706

While this is a step down from part 1, in actual film grade and set design, it realizes that from the get go.

There is not one funny part in the entire movie.  They use the corniest jokes that are not funny for any age.  Plus this movie is so so low budget.  They used foam balls with smiley faces to represent the ""baby snowmen,"" but not only did they look fake, they only moved onces at a time.  Whenever there was a scene with a bunch of these creatures, they didn'y move at all because they were just foam balls!  Even when they would do a scene where one of them moved, you can just barely see the guys hand that is holding it.  And did I mention that none of the snowmens mouths move when they talk?  Not even Jack Frost, but this is probably because they picked up this cheap snowman costume at a halloween store. (...) When you are in the video store you might see the title and say, ""wow, Revenge of the Killer Mutant Sowman, this movie must be hilarious!"" (that's what I thought).

1386857,1,B000051S5B,"The first ""Jack Frost"" film, despite the presence of Shannon Elizabeth, was a flaming wreck of a movie best suited for viewers incapable of such mundane activities as tying their shoes or figuring out bar soap. Imagine my surprise when I learned the folks behind the first travesty released a sequel. What were these guys thinking? They were thinking about money. The first film did well in video stores due to an eye catching holographic cover. That the film inside the nifty box was a complete waste of time didn't enter into the picture until the poor dupes got the rental home and shrieked in disgust. Anyway, the money rolled in. So now we have ""Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Killer Mutant Snowman"" to worry about. And worry you will if you discover you possess the mental and physical fortitude required to survive a single viewing of this nightmare. My entire film watching career has changed forever due to ""Jack Frost 2,"" and not in a good way. In my review for the first film, I promised to watch movies like this one so I could warn others not to make a fatal mistake at the video store. From now on, you're on your own. In fact, I blame the movie renting public for the existence of this film.
If you haven't burned the memory of it out of your brain cells, the first film introduced us to a warped serial killer who, while on the way to his execution, was exposed to dangerous toxic wastes as a result of an auto accident. The outcome of this incident was Jack Frost, a sinister snowman burning with hatred for the sheriff of a small mountain town who captured him years before. Thus the killer snowman heads to the sheriff's town where he wreaks havoc on the residents. The townspeople fight back with a lot of cheesy dialogue, lame special effects, and gallons of antifreeze. As the first film came to a close, I breathed a sigh of relief that the horror was finally over. Wrong. In ""Jack Frost 2,"" the same sheriff and a few other principals from the first film reappear to once again battle the evil that has a carrot nose and two eyes made out of coal. This time out, mere antifreeze won't stop Jackie, at least not for long. Nope, a company secretly experimenting with Jack's remains somehow provided the killer with several important immunities: he can't melt in sunlight, he can travel around in water form, and he can change the weather at will. Important developments, certainly, but you won't care too much about them by the end of the movie.
Sheriff Sam Tiler, his wife, and another couple from first film, decide to take a trip to an island so they can forget about Jack Frost. Tiler especially carries a lot of unpleasant baggage from his first encounter with the evil snowman. He cannot shake the feeling that the serial killer somehow survived the events of the first film, a feeling that eventually bears fruit when carrot nose turns up at the resort where Tiler and company are staying. The movie keeps getting more and more ridiculous as the story unfolds. Frosty dispatches a bunch of innocent tourists, including two yucks trapped on a life raft, a trio of bubble headed girls, and a bunch of vacationers at the resort in particularly bloody ways. A few characters, including an annoying English colonel, a goofy bartender, and the head of resort security (with links to the first film, of course) appear to provide lukewarm comic relief. Tiler eventually goes out of his head as the snowman runs riot on the tropic island, thus leaving it up to his wife and others to carry on the battle. I thought the movie a lost cause within the first ten minutes, but by the time Jack Frost started giving birth to little snowballs sporting razor sharp teeth and bad attitudes I knew I was watching pure dreck.
""Jack Frost 2"" rarely works. The acting is so over the top bad that the performances eclipse the histrionics seen in the first movie. The sight gags simply failed to elicit any chuckles from me, especially Jack Frost's groan worthy dialogue. About the only thing that worked-- moderately, if at all--was the bloody ways Jackie dispatched his victims. Ice daggers soar through the air and punch through bodies, one person perishes in a crushing, and the snowballs with teeth slice and dice a few poor souls while Jack steps off center stage for awhile. Beyond the gore, ""Jack Frost 2"" disappoints through a mixture of lame acting, cheesy effects, and a bad script. I am thinking about retiring from watching films if a ""Jack Frost 3"" hits the store shelves in the near future. Well, I probably won't, but you get the idea. It is the total badness of ""Jack Frost 2"" that makes me spout such extreme statements.
The DVD version of the film boasts a few extras. There's an interview with the director, a commentary, a behind the scenes look at the movie, and some trailers. The worst extra has to be the rap music video starring all of the actors in the film. All I can say after watching this jaw droppingly bad attempt at comedy is...O.K., there is nothing nice I can say about it here. ""You'll never work in this town again"" might be an appropriate statement, but this time worn phrase doesn't encompass the depths of scorn I feel for the movie. Don't buy ""Jack Frost 2."" Don't rent ""Jack Frost 2."" Don't stand in the same room when the movie plays on the television set. Just put the idea of watching the film out of your mind and do something constructive instead. You can thank me later.",1080691200,3,5422,4.5734840698869474

1386859,5,B000051S5B,"After seeing the wonderful first JACK FROST, I was wondering if the sequel could deliver as well.  It's probably not quite as good as the first, only if the premise isn't as funny and original as it was the first time.  BUT it's still one howler of a movie.  In watching the extras, director/writer Michael Cooney is obviously the class clown with a warped although stimulating sense of humor.  One can see why this movie is so outrageously hilarious!
Christopher Allport, Eileen Seeley, Marsha Clark and Chip Heller are back from the original and David Allen Brooks has plastic surgically returned as Agent Manning.  They are all priceless, and have some really funny scenes.
But the star of this one is definitely Frost himself and his killer snowbabies.  Looking like Gremlins, smiley faces and the Pillsbury Doughboy all combined, their attack on the lodge is hysterical.  The deaths are more gruesome in this one, but they're done in such a ""cartoon"" style, the violence is more camp than gore.

So when this second one came out, me and the wife got all excited and prepared ourselves for maximum laughs.  Sadly, the maximum laughs were not to be.  This movie was so dumb that it was boring. About 45 minutes before it ended we were sitting completely silent on the couch, not laughing, not scared, not stimulated, not happy.  Just pondering which one of us had enough energy to get up and push the stop button.

I mean, it was hilarious. There was one part when the carrot went through a guy's stomach. And the part when he goes inside an icecube? That was funny. The two funniest parts were when snow fell on the ground at the island, and everyone was outside throwing snowballs, and jack Frost threw one and it took the guys arm off. It happened so fast it was funny. Then the part when the baby snowman hatched.

1386896,4,B000051S5B,"I was ridiculously excited when I first heard about this sequel to Michael Cooney's criminally underrated splatter-comedy, ""Jack Frost.""  The first ""Jack"" was an endlessly entertaining mix of high- and low-brow humor, gory slapstick, and genuinely striking visual direction.  Like most converts, I first rented ""Jack Frost"" because of the tacky holographic cover art.  However, the film itself was so inventive and exciting that I had to own it.  The DVD edition of ""Jack Frost"" was enjoyable enough (the widescreen transfer was a nice surprise), although there were no noteworthy extras.  This remains a true shame, and I eagerly await the arrival of a fitting Special Edition DVD of the first ""Jack Frost.""
With the DVD release of ""Jack Frost 2,"" A-Pix Entertainment has redeemed itself (for the moment).  The Jack Frost 2 DVD is riddled with the type of cool extras that have become standard fare for big studio releases.  Some extras work (the ""music video"" is good for a laugh), and some don't (the ""behind-the-scenes"" section leaves much to be desired.  I'm probably as big a fan of the Jack movies as anyone could be, and even I was fast-forwarding past these largely uneventful vignettes shortly after they began).  However, regardless of the relative highs and lows, die-hard Jack fans have finally received what they have sought for so long... a full-length audio commentary by writer/director Michael Cooney.
Cooney makes for an engaging host during his insightful play-by-play account of the production (his nifty accent is a surprise bonus!).  I've sat through dozens of these commentaries, and while the vast majority of them feature the musings of more widely celebrated Hollywood players, few are as informative and amusing as this one.  Cooney addresses a litany of topics - from his decision to shoot on High-Definition video, to the constant rain which forced the film to be photographed primarily in close-ups so as not to reveal the omnipresent tents in the background.  Each bit of information is sure to be appreciated by the faithful few who revel in every exaggerated camera set-up, knowingly silly one-liner, and hysterically creative action sequence.  It is a welcomed wealth of insight into the working methods of a truly talented young filmmaker.
Of course, die-hard fan that I am, I wanted more.  Cooney says little about his own background and training, and there is no mention of the film's conscious influences either.  I suppose that it is possible that the spirits of Sam Raimi, Joe Dante, Peter Jackson, and countless others were nowhere to be found during the production of each Jack Frost film, but that seems highly unlikely.  I would like to have heard more from Cooney about the effects of past and present Masters on his personal approach to filmmaking.  Films as self-consciously stylized as his sort of beg such name-dropping, don't they?
No matter... the DVD is a joy to behold.  And the movie is pretty terrific as well.  While never quite reaching the manic highs of its predecessor, ""Jack Frost 2"" is certainly packed with enough ingenuity to delight fans new and old.  The snappy visuals and clever transitions are pretty much wall-to-wall, which is wonderful news for those of us who couldn't get enough of the melted Jack Frost P.O.V. shots in the original (in this installment, I am especially fond of the rapid zoom/dissolve which serves as the transition between Captain Fun's explanation of his secret plan and the good Captain's plan in full-blown action... very cool shot).  The introduction of Jack Frost's offspring is an appreciated twist, as is Sheriff Sam's hilarious shift towards simple-minded buffoonery during the film's conclusion.
The montage sequences are especially noteworthy.  The opening lab sequence and the offspring combat set piece are visually dazzling examples of storytelling efficiency.  Shawn Paper's perfectly paced edits and Jeremy Paige's second-unit camera shine especially bright in these sections of the film.  If nothing else, both Jack films serve as stellar examples of giddy action films crafted on nonexistent budgets. This is good stuff, folks.  Really, really good.
In fact, my only complaint is the use of High-Definition video in place of 35mm film.  Despite the admirably clean transfer on the DVD, the High-Definition video only serves to distract from the overall quality of the movie.  High-Definition video may be the undisputed King of Video formats, but its inherently flat imagery and compromised color palette are no match for properly wielded celluloid.  Cooney and his crew manipulate their High-Definition cameras as well as anyone I've seen in the world of short and feature filmmaking (in fact, cinematographer Dean Lent deserves a special shout-out for eliciting some surprisingly vivid color from the notoriously droll world of video).  However, at the end of the day, ""Jack 2""'s low-budget look seems only heightened by the use of video instead of film.  For me, this was a bit of a let-down.
Of course, the fact that a sequel was even prepared remains a rather astounding feat, so I suppose I should quit with the silly fanboy complaints.  The bottom line is that both ""Jack"" films are wicked cool additions to the frequently overlooked splatter-comedy genre.  And like every other splatter-comedy masterpiece (a list of fanboy favorites that beg, at least once, to go without mention in an online horror movie review), Michael Cooney and his team seem destined for bigger and better things.  I, for one, am excited about the movies these guys could create if ever provided the luxuries of a major studio's financial excess.  To be sure, when that day comes, I'll be the first in line for a ticket.",980121600,4,5713,5.100966702470462
1386897,5,B000051S5B,"First off, I only saw the VHS version of this, so I won't get into any ""extras"".  Secondly, the makers of that Michael Keaton stuff should've been SUED for what they pulled, ripping off the original that was ""Jack Frost"".  I actually saw a mom at the store in shock to see ""Jack Frost 2"".  Heh...not what you think, lady...
So exactly what is it?  Without ruining any plot, let me say that this was as good if not better than the original, which was five stars in its own right.  With b-horror, the line between glorious camp and horriblepart is so thin that many fail miserably when trying to create a flick like this, but never fear - the creators of this one stuck with the formula that worked the first time, and added enough new surprises to set this apart from the original.  I'll almost swear the makers of ""Leprechaun"" did this one, too, since there can't be THAT many talented people not getting mainstream respect in Hollywood.

7929295,2,B000051S5B,"This frost-bitten sequel to 1997's surprisingly clever and enjoyable ""Jack Frost"" finds the titular killer snowman (voiced by Scott MacDonald) traversing to a tropical resort to harass shell-shocked Sheriff Tiler (Christopher Allport, looking like he'd rather have a recurring role on ""7th Heaven"" than do this again) and company once more. ""Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman"" is every bit as ridiculous as you'd expect, but is also even cheaper and dopier than you may be anticipating.

Opening with a title in the coolest of cool Windows '98 fonts, 'Chiller,' the chintzy look and feel of the film is established almost immediately, as if to warn you to turn it off before it's too late. Likewise, the cinematography is virtually non existent. ""Jack Frost 2"" has all the production value of a turn-of-the-century Comedy Central sitcom, but with hardly a fraction of the wit. Michael Cooney returns to the director's chair for this direct-to-video cheapie and although he tries to bring the same humor and energy from the first, it just doesn't translate. Just like snow can't hold up in a warm environment, neither can the original's charms redeem this sorry affair. Jack will try to make you smile time and time again, but his water-logged puns aren't enough to break the ice.

On the upside, the fast and loose feel of the production means that no one is taking this terribly seriously, and neither should you. Midway through the film, Jack sprouts a few dozen snowball offspring who wreak havoc on the resort, ""Gremlins"" style. These slightly entertaining bits, culminating in the film's deus ex banana (see it to believe it), offer moments of semi-inspired silliness, but by then, most of its cool has melted away.

7929297,3,B000051S5B,"Released in 2000, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman brings back Sheriff Sam Tiler (Christopher Allport ) and his wife (Eileen Seeley) as they fly to a tropical island to celebrate Christmas where no possibility of a killer snowman exists. But they're wrong, DEAD wrong. Chip Heller & Marsha Clark also return as the couples friends, who get married on the island. This time the character of Agent Manners is played by David Allen Brooks while Scott MacDonald once again uses his voice talents for the snowman.

This sequel brings back the writer/director of the first film, Michael Cooney, and the main cast members (or characters). I cant compare it to the 1997 straight-to-video film because I don't remember it (not to be confused with the 1998 theatrical movie of the same name, starring Michael Keaton). Regardless, the production quality of Jack Frost 2 is noticeably micro-budget and not even up to snuff with the typical Syfy flick. Its about on par with, say, an episode of Married With Children.

If you can handle that kind of very low-budget, Jack Frost 2 is fairly entertaining. There are a few good-lookin women, like cutie Jennifer Lyons, but they don't last long before the snowman gets em. In short, they're all decidedly peripheral characters, which is a shame. Where the movies genius shines is in the second half with all the cute lil killer snowballs and their amusing interactions with the characters; they're quite entertaining in their no-budget way.

The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita, California.

I even went to Walmart and was like ""Hey, where's Jack Frost 2?"" to a guy working in the movie section. Unfortunately, I had to just rent it at my favorite video store, Movie Warehouse. I was a little disappointed because they didn't show Jack too much this time around. They show him in all his snowman glory about 50 minutes in, but even then, they don't show him too long and he just stands there. He doesn't move around like in the original. I didn't find out til a few years ago, that all the vhs copies were heavily edited. I recently just ordered this on dvd because of the release of the original on blu-ray. I watched on Youtube and Jack Frost 2 is a lot gorier and with more language than I ever saw as a kid. Why were the VHS copies so heavily edited?

One year has passed, and Sheriff Sam Tiler is still obsessed and worried that Jack Frost will come back for him. Someone has dug up the Anti-Freeze and Jack is released from his prison. Sam, his wife Anne, Deputy Joe, and his fiancee Marla take a vacation to a tropical island where it's very warm and it never snows. Somehow, Jack follows Sam and his friends to the island and begin to kill the tourists. Jack appears as an ice cube, and a carrot for awhile, til he finally makes his grand appearance. He begins to hack up little snowballs that are his babies. They are so adorable! I forgot how cute they were. Sam, Anne, Agent Manners and the island workers must fight to survive the snowball rampage, and this time...not even Anti-Freeze can stop them! If you love the original, I highly recommend JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN!!!",1482883200,,1724,4.337461300309598
