4487897,5,B004WO9OMA,"The fourth season of ""According to Jim"" starring Jim Belushi and Courtney Throne-Smith as his wife Cheryl, is arguably the best of the series.  I won't go into individual episode descriptions, but I will point out some highlights.  During the course of Season 4 there are two underlying plot-lines.  One is that Jim and Cheryl are seeking assistance in having another child.  The second is Cheryl's sister Dana and her relationship with Jim and Cheryl's fertility doctor, Ryan.  This plot-line culminates in the season finale ""Wedding Bell Blues"", the marriage ceremony of Dana and Ryan (and problems caused and solved by Jim and brother-in-law Andy).

Other episode highlights include ""Geronimo Jim"" where Jim, Ryan and Andy explore the adventurous (or reckless side in the girls opinion) of the male psyche, ""Father-Daughter Dance"" where the series touches on the relationship between fathers and daughters as they grow and ""The Wedding Dress"" where Cheryl wants to give Dana her wedding dress, but the condition of the dress is, shall we say, less than perfect thanks to Jim.

However, within Season 4 is the single best episode of the entire series in my opinion, ""The Spelling Bee"".  Here daughter Ruby shows off her talents by winning a local spelling bee.  Then Jim and Cheryl are sent on the dream/nightmare of every supportive parent, helping Ruby as she moves ever higher and higher in ""The Bee"" as Andy calls it.  This means every single Saturday involves a car trip to different competitions located further and further away.  All the time Ruby glories in the shrimp at Red Lobster which is her reward for winning each event.  I won't spoil it, but this is a neatly presented, fully flushed out episode in the lives of parents and their kids to which most everyone can relate.

If you are a fan of this family sit-com classic - enjoy.  If you missed the series and want to catch some of the best shows, season 4 is a perfect place to start.
