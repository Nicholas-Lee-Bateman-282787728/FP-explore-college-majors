But if you want another way to input phonics in the brain of your children, this is a really great way.  My suggestion, turn it on and leave the room LOL!  Once was okay, twice was too much for me, though I have to admit, I learned something new!  :)",1387238400,,299,3.9
4114056,5,B003EGDDKG,I teach first grade students and in the winter we often have days where the kids can't go out for recess.  We watch a few minutes of this movie and the kids love it.  All of them.  They sing the songs and I believe that it is helping them to learn phonics.,1362268800,,256,3.8846153846153846

4114059,5,B003EGDDKG,Very  attractive in color and sound. Really gets the youngsters attention and holds it.  I will let them just play in her play room and she listens continuously as she plays which helps her to retain the information.,1353628800,2,216,4.657894736842105

4114061,5,B003EGDDKG,"I don't usually write reviews but this product deserves a review.  I don't want to restate what the previous reviews have shared.  I agree with them. This is my favorite phonics dvd.  My granddaughter loves it.  The music is very engaging.  She is reading at second grade level and going into first  grade. I put the dvd on in the car  to and from camp,  I am using it as a summer review of all the long vowels sounds. Short vowel sounds are covered in the the Rock and Learn phonics number one.  I would estimate the video covers between 200 and three hundred words.  Each sound has at least 5 examples.  Covers the r controlled vowels nicely too.  In fact, I am buying a second one for a friend who's son is a struggling reader and going into third grade...as a summer review.  Also great is the Electric Company series now on dvd.  I just found out the new Electric company is on tv.  You can't put a value on the importance of phonics in becoming an good reader!  My favorite phonics program is the Triple Spin Reading Wheel...phenominal!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Day-Reading-Wheel/dp/B0051VLL0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Day Reading Wheel</a>",1311120000,11,1198,5.035714285714286
4114062,5,B003EGDDKG,"I had reviewed Phonics 1 in the past and found this to be great for pre-K students, and Phonics 2 is a great follow-up to the first DVD going into more complex words and concepts. My daughter is going into first grade this next year and I can tell that this would be a great DVD for any first grade student.

With the use of great music and repetition, this DVD hits home the point of the importance of learning to read. What I loved about this DVD is that it makes reading fun, and I can tell that as a child you would just want to watch this to ""rock out"" as well as simply having fun with the on-screen characters.

All-in-all, this DVD provides kids a great way to learn!",1308096000,3,675,4.106060606060606
