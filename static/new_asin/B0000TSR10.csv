1946079,4,B0000TSR10,"I like movies based on true stories. This is one of the most disturbing, but ultimately the most heartening, of such movies I've seen in a long, long time.

In 1998, three white supremacist young men picked up a black hitchhiker, beat him up, chained him to the back of their pickup truck, and dragged him to death. The white sheriff of Jasper (Jon Voight) and the black mayor (Louis Gossett, Jr.) found their authority and their friendship tested as the trial approached in a media frenzy, publicity-seeking outsiders, Black Panthers and the KKK. Jasper had been a town that prided itself on its racial brotherhood and peace, and its strong Christian values. This trial brought out the best and the worst in people, and caused a lot of re-evaluation, but ultimately for the better.

As someone who lives in a racially mixed town myself, it was a tearful time watching this movie, but inspiring in the end.",1336694400,,906,4.727848101265823

1946081,5,B0000TSR10,"I remember seeing this came on the evening news. I was in total disbelief. I was interested n learning more about it. This movie will anger u, move u2 tears, ultimately surprise u. To think that this family forgave these people for their crimes will completely make u understand the power & love of God. This movie is wonderful, highly recommended but its sad that even though the sheets r gone, the racism is still there undercover. This movie is worth 10 times the price on amazon, superb quality",1265846400,2,498,4.606741573033708
1946082,4,B0000TSR10,"In 1998, three white men picked up James Byrd, Jr., an African American. After beating him and stripping him naked, they chained him to the back of their pickup and dragged his naked body across country ground for approximately three miles.  While the defendants claim that Byrd was already dead, forensic evidence disputes this claim. All three men were found guilty of murder in the first degree. Two of the three defendants, John King and Lawrence Russell Brewer, were sentenced to death though both remain on Texas's Death Row. Shawn Allen Berry, the youngest of the three, was only sentenced to life in prison.

The film begins with the Sheriff being called out to the scene and only shows the crime itself in flashbacks. The drama here is more about race relations in the town, the relationship between the white Sheriff and African American mayor, and the trial itself. While details are loosely based on the case, this depiction does not reach documentary quality.

The acting was stellar.  Showtime did an excellent job picking Voight as Sheriff and Gossett as the mayor.  These two men came off as very real and could almost lose you in the story.  If you can handle the brutality and the sheer pain of the situation, Jasper, Texas is definitely worth watching.

1946083,5,B0000TSR10,"I rented this movie when it first hit the video stores & later wound up purchasing a copy on DVD. It was sickening to watch the scene where James Byrd gets dragged to death by the three racist, young white men. I own a book on the tragedy & the book goes into much greater detail regarding the events which led up to the brutal murder. John King, the ringleader, is believed to have been sexually assaulted by a group of blacks in prison & this supposedly made him a bonafide racist. If that's true it doesn't justify in any way what he did to Mr. Byrd, who was just a random victim. I was jumped by four blacks in 1980 when I was 14 (I'm caucasian) & it was definitely racially motivated. For a number of years afterward I had racist feelings but have long since gotten over them. Racism is WRONG & simply cannot be tolerated. Racism must be fought wherever it is encountered because we are all human beings and all equal in the eyes of God. We should focus on our similarities & not on our differences. The KKK is not nearly as strong as it once was & is fading fast. Getting back to the movie, I thought it was good that they showed many blacks & whites trying to bridge their differences (especially the church communities). When the KKK & Black Panthers came to Jasper to start trouble, the town (blacks & whites) stood up to both groups. It was satisfying to watch those three scumbags get what they deserved. Two got the death penalty & the third got life without parole, I believe. Hopefully this will send a clear message to bigots everywhere that this isn't the 19th century anymore & if they commit these violent, hate crimes they will forfeit their own lives. May James Byrd rest in peace.",1158019200,27,1701,4.369085173501578
1946084,3,B0000TSR10,"This is a movie that will most likely illiciate mixed feelings on both sides of cultures. Although there will always be hate crimes, that doesn't make it right still. But also there is the fact that whites also have racism remarks made against them. Its the same way with every nation and every race, one shouldn't feel as though its just them and their seperate culture under attack.

Jasper Texas is a movie that is full of anger, despair and hate that for centuries has boiled and simmered without being taken care of or tried resolve. Even in this day and age it is a delicate topic and often will have cold shoulders because of it.

This is a gruesome movie, that shows several pictures and scenes that where supposed to happen, people with delicate stomaches probally will be ill-advised to watch this.

If you like historical movies or ones based on true events, this wouldn't be a bad choice to watch. Otherwise......",1115164800,2,925,4.662576687116564

1946132,4,B0000TSR10,"I was stunned when I first heard of this awful event.  But when I learned it was in Jasper Texas I was mortified. Billy Rowles and I were teammates on the same softball team back in '72. I knew him when was an DPS officer. The man did not play favorites when he was on the job if you broke the law you were liked anyone else who did. The tense situation that followed (some of it puffed up by the mainstream media) brought back memories to the Rodney King and in Miami, Florida the Arthur McDuffie incidents. In fact the incident with Arthur McDuffie cased the Dade County authorities in South Florida to declare martial.

Good luck if you ran out of gas the selling of gasoline and the buying of adult beverages was prohibited. While the nation expected a ""typical"" southern sheriff,

the world saw an  individual who did his best to prevent a powder keg from exploding.  The cast was very good but I did not picture Jon Voight as the sheriff. In fact John Deihl would have been a better choice. Mr.  Voight's performance  reminded me of his role in ""Varsity Blues"" as Coach Bud Kilmer. An un-rated performance should be noticed by Kate Trotter who play Billy's spouse Connie.",1405123200,3,1177,4.47196261682243

Its very gruesome and I cant believe another human being could do this to a person.  Its very real and graphic.  You can actually see body parts being literally ripped off this poor man.  The pictures they show in court proceedings are horrible!!
