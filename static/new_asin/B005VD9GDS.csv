8487411,4,B005VD9GDS,"Our lead is an English speaking AmeriCans SPY and what a handsome spy he is. I would rate this a FIVE but for it's ending. That ""ONE"" word text can only mean a sequel??",1400112000,,168,3.9705882352941178
8487412,5,B005VD9GDS,"This is one of the best Romance - Suspense (with some humor) Korean dramas I have seen.  The music beautifully accents each episode.  (In fact, I shall try to buy the soundtrack, if available.)  The actors are excellent.  In fact, I do not see why Dennis Oh is not a huge star in Korea.  He has stunning looks (he should be in Jang Keun Suk's new drama ""Beautiful Man"" as he could be just be an additional ""beautiful man"". I notice that he has two Chinese TV dramas but I do not know how to buy those.  Anyway, do not buy the drama if you are very busy because you will just want to see it to the end!",1380758400,2,601,4.008403361344538
