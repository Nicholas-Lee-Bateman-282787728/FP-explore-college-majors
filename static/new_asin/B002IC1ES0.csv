8479363,5,B002IC1ES0,"The information in this DVD is really quite remarkable. The premise is based on the concept that without proper stretching the connective and muscular tissue in our bodies shrinks and looses flexibility over time. The DVD is not just about improving posture and muscle tone to decrease a bulging gut, but a comprehensive system of limbering the body, improving flexibility, circulation and stamina. It is like an extensive Yoga regime, just without all of the time and discipline. If you are into getting up at dawn and doing the Yoga regime, hats off to you! I am to impatient and just want the results in the most efficient manner possible and this program delivers that. The program does not reduce body fat, so you still need to watch your diet and exercise, however I have found with a modest 5 - minute daily stretch my posture improved, the extended gut noticeably reduced and I found it more pleasurable to go for a walk everyday, hence extending my walk and consequently helping me to convert fat to muscle. One criticism is that the DVD navigation is a little confusing. (I noticed they have a new version, perhaps this has improved). Don't let that discourage you, spend a little time with the program when you first get it, watch the general information sections (Maybe the most valuable parts) and learn the simple fast daily stretches. Once you get going you will wonder how something seemingly so simple can yield such an improved quality of life. Highly recommended.",1283472000,4,1482,4.815686274509804
