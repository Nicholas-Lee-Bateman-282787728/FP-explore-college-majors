8615577,4,B00FGELTM8,"Broken Victory is a strong Independent Christian Film detailing the personal account of one's family struggle within a new world order.  Although the film is celebrating its 25 year anniversary, it holds up exceedingly well.  Strong direction, excellent acting, and true-to-life situations make this an excellent choice for family viewing.",1380240000,,339,5.76
