5570248,4,B00BBGZA9S,"I first saw ""Five Against the House"" on late-night TV in the early 1960s. While it's not a great movie, it's worth watching for several reasons.

First, it features Brian Keith and Kim Novak, both of whom went on to have great acting careers. Their performance in this movie demonstrates their potential.

Second, the first part of the movie, much of which is set on a Midwestern campus, is a humorous and somewhat accurate portrayal of college life in the 1950s (well before the days of the Animal House mentality). The treatment that the four upperclassmen housemates accord to the freshman fellow they've enlisted as their lackey is classic (although it's never quite explained why this fellow continues to willingly subject himself to their abuse).

Third, the plot they concoct to rob Harold's Club in Reno is actually ingenious. Of course, we all know it's not going to work because something will go wrong (which it does). But in the meantime we're kept in suspense, and given that these are five college kids trying to stick it to the establishment, we're going to root for them to succeed.

Finally, Brian Keith's performance of a Korean War vet with severe psychological problems (he's spent time in a mental institution prior to enrolling in college) is outstanding, realistic, and compelling.

It's a movie worth watching on an evening when you're tired, don't want to have to think too much, but want to be entertained.",1379548800,6,1432,4.900826446280992
5570249,3,B00BBGZA9S,"A very uneven film, with the plot all over the map, until about three-quarters of the way through, when it decides to be a heist-caper movie.  In the opening, it's about four college guys and Kim Novak, the girlfriend of one of them.  There's a lot of zippy, somewhat sophomoric, smart aleck dialogue, at times cute, but not relevant to the through-line of the story.  The characters and the intentions of the plot are out of focus.  One of the four guys is Brian Keith, evidently a war buddy of one of the others, and he apparently has been released from a mental hospital.  He has a nasty temper and a short fuse.  Anyway, the college chums go on a gambling jaunt to a Las Vegas casino, during which an attempted robbery takes place.  They return to campus, and a good stretch of the film devotes itself to the romance between Kim Novak and one of the college guys.  She's hesitant to commit to marriage, and so there is much back and forth, until finally she agrees to get married.  It is at this point that the other college buddies, unbeknown to the one who is about to get married, concoct a scheme to rob the same Las Vegas casino they had earlier visited.  This involves a trailer that they use to transport a duplicate casino pushcart in.  When the about-to-marry guy realizes he's been sucked into a dangerous scheme, he balks, and the Brian Keith character essentially seizes control of the situation with a gun and strongarms the others into following through with the robbery.",1375920000,2,1489,4.56015037593985
5570250,5,B00BBGZA9S,"I have purchased several of Ms. Novak's movies because I am a great fan of hers. In watching these movies, I realize that she is not one of Hollywood's ""dumb blonds"". The productions are no match for today's movies by many standards. However, I can appreciate the time in which these movies were made, and am intrigued by all aspects of these movies - the actors, the sets, the production, and - of course, the sexy Ms. Novak! I think there are many ways to enjoy these movies. And Ms. Novak is at the top of my list of those ways.",1374192000,3,531,4.267326732673268

8565372,1,B00BBGZA9S,"The closest this flimsy affair ever gets to film noir is Kim Novak's sultry entrance as a tight-gowned nightclub chanteuse. Regrettably, we quickly discover that it's a college town nightclub and Kim's character is strictly cornpone, despite being played by the svelte eminently kissable 1955 Kim Novak. The romance comic book writing doesn't help: ""I may look like a blonde bombshell that's been everywhere and done everything but I'm not. All these big emotions are wonderful but they just kinda scare me too."" Erk. Yet another gutless faux noir that can't decide what horse it's on. Heist flick or goofy college hijinks? Leopold and Loeb a la Compulsion, the bored rich boy in the argyle cardigan with a Nietzschean Superman complex who wants to knock over a casino as a field experiment just to say he did it? ""If we don't keep the money,"" he reasons, ""we haven't actually committed a crime."" Oh. And these four boys, all cut from cardboard, are law students? Please.",1503619200,,971,4.890909090909091
8565373,4,B00BBGZA9S,"Pretty Good Film Noir!  Interesting story, and I loved the action that took place in the Legendary Harolds Club in Reno, Nevada. (Harolds Club or Bust!)  Package arrived early. Great delivery service as usual!",1502064000,,209,5.117647058823529
8565374,3,B00BBGZA9S,"This movie had some good characters but I have issues with the plot, which really doesn't even take shape until well into the movie (too explain more would mean to give away details about the movie so I will refrain).  And the ending was a bit underwhelming... too soft.  Again, some good characters and enjoyable in parts, but not one for the ages.",1496707200,,349,4.523809523809524
8565375,1,B00BBGZA9S,"If you're thinking of paying to rent or purchase this movie to stream through Prime, think twice. The aspect ratio (i.e., the size and shape of the image relative to the screen) is all wrong. It should be presented in widescreen, but it has been stretched vertically to fill the screen, which has radically distorted the image. Everything appears really tall and skinny compared to how it should appear. Personally, I get a headache trying to watch movies that are visually askew like that, but even if it doesn't pain you literally, it is a pain in the posterior, simply due to the annoyance factor. So, if you want to see this film, get it via another avenue, and don't waste your dough trying to stream it here.",1485648000,3,714,4.5859375

8565377,2,B00BBGZA9S,"Five Against the House is a 1955 flick that is really peculiar, on the one hand it wants to be an inarticulate college film, with dumb remarks and idiotic hazing, and on the other, a heist film with touches of noir.

The acting is horrible and the script is no better.  The ending, entirely pointless.

Four college chums (played by 30 year olds), after wasting the first hour talking about girls, fights and cigarettes, decide to rob a Nevada casino, the Harold's Club.

It has Brian Keith from the film noir Tight Spot (1955), which was average, and the film noir Nightfall (1957) which was a bit better.  In this he just smokes and then goes nuts a few times.

Kim Novak, from the good 1954 film noir Pushover, is hot, but doesn't do much.  We don't even see her in a tub or anything.

Kerwin Mathews (The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) and Jack the Giant Killer (1962)) is annoying, as he doesn't have any heavy gravitas here.  He's horrible.

Add Alvy Moore (a comic actor from Green Acres) who is probably the most awful choice of actor, as all he does is make stupid comments throughout and you wish he would get run over by a steam train.

William Conrad is wasted as a casino 'money cart pusher' who gets taken in a really stupid way.

For car buffs, you'll probably like the ""automated parking garage""  (see  Bowser, Pigeon Hole and Roto Park systems).  That's about it, nothing adds up much in here.",1449014400,,1407,4.462745098039216
8565378,4,B00BBGZA9S,"5 AGAINST THE HOUSE is an odd little film with a great title and cast. This is an interesting film noir caper from the 50's. The cast is what makes it interesting and they include Kim Novak, Kerwin Mathews, Brian Keith, Guy Madison, William Conrad and Alvy Moore. Stirling Silliphant worked on the script.",1414800000,,305,4.666666666666667
8565379,5,B00BBGZA9S,wonder if it really could be done the way they did it in Vegas????,1412467200,,66,3.7857142857142856
8565380,4,B00BBGZA9S,"Come on, every guy, and maybe every gal too, wants to be the first, the number one at doing something. Come on as well that every guy, and every gal, from hunger who was not born with a silver spoon in his or her mouth, and maybe a few of those too, wants to make a big-time money score. Those two ideas, those two worthy ideas, are what drive the mid-1950s film noir under review, Five Against The House. And just for one minute the two ideas come together as a certain nefarious scheme almost makes the nut. But of course those of us who have been down the noir road before know in our bones that the scheme cannot possibly work in a cinematic world where crime does not pay.

Here is the skinny. Four college guys, law students, including two ex-Korean War buddies, Al (played by Guy Madison) and Brick who had saved Als life over there (played by Brian Keith), shades of Tennessee Williams Brick in Cat On A Hot-Tin Roof, just back from the rigors of ranch life in California where one of the guys father has a ranch stopped off at Harolds Club in Reno on the way back to the greater rigors of college life. While there a career criminal type tried to rob the joint and got the slammer for his efforts. The lesson they learn from that event and from the mouth of the arresting officer is that no way in hell can anybody pull off that kind of caper in Reno casino land.

This where the two ideas, being first and being rich, merge with one of the guys devising a master plan to commit the perfect crime by grabbing a million cool ones from Harolds with no gun play and no traces left. He doesnt care about the dough since he comes from dough, just being first. Brick though, Brick from hunger, and Brick who took quite a beating over in Korea and had spent time at a VA hospital for what we would now call PTSD had riches idea, easy street ideas. And so the plan unfolds, with another roommate thrown in to help.

Problem was that the scheme needs four guys to work. That is where Al, who is head over heels over a townie and torch singer at a local night club, Kaye (played by Kim Novak with lip-synched singing), came in. Brick by hook or by crook brought Al in under false pretenses (and later to insure Als participation dragged Kaye in too). The caper naturally went off according to plan, Bricks plan which involved actually keeping the dough and using some rough play with a gun if necessary. Of course no way that war-shattered, from hunger, and psychologically-scarred Brick was going to be able to keep the dough after he was confronted by Al who talked him into surrendering to the on-rushing police. Like I said crime does not pay in these noirs and here is example 256 for you.

P.S. the story line of a bunch of college students, law students to boot, would have been more believable if just for one minute any of these four comrades actually looked at a book but maybe I am just being picky. I won't even mention that as law students they all should have known crime does not pay and avoided the caper. Maybe I am just being picky again.",1395360000,,3055,4.317073170731708
