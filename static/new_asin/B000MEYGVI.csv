2729270,5,B000MEYGVI,"The the combination of Julie Andrews an Omar Sharif is just wonderful I had seen and own this movie previously not in DVD and wanted to make sure I would always be able to see it.
The story is great and I think that you should carry more of Omar sharif movies as I am a very fond of this actor and his work.
Please add more DVD like this one to your selection, The Harem,Mayerling (Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve) Peter the Great.

2729271,5,B000MEYGVI,After waiting YEARS for Tamarind Seed to come out in the US I finally ordered this Korean import.  Amazon I am happy with my DVD.

2729272,4,B000MEYGVI,"Intriging love story with espionage thrills under a cloud of suspicion. Superb casting: Sharif and Andrews, perfect in their roles. One of the very rare occasions in which a screen couple really capture feelings and doubts of a risky relationship.

2729299,4,B000MEYGVI,"This is a 5 star movie, and I agree with all of the complementary comments by other reviewers. It's a beautiful and riveting espionage and love story that takes place during the height of the cold war.  You don't want to miss this movie!

This Korean issued DVD is surprisingly good -- excellent picture and sound quality, and it appears to be an unedited version.  It is also presented in the original 2.35:1 super-wide screen aspect ratio.  However, I have withheld 1 star because I suspect that the widescreen version on this Korean disc was not created from the original, but was made by cropping a full screen version in order to shape it into a faux widescreen format.  The reason I suspect this is because the actors heads are chopped off in many scenes. Directors don't normally film movies that way.  I don't have access to the original theatrical widescreen version, so I can't compare and verify this.  Can any other reviewers verify or refute this?  I want to be fair to this Korean issue, because in all other respects it is perfect.",1320796800,,1046,4.646739130434782
2729300,4,B000MEYGVI,THE DVD WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.  THE ONLY DOWNSIDE WAS THAT THE IMAGES WERE MUCH DARKERS THAN MY VHS VERSION.,1314403200,,112,4.333333333333333
2729301,5,B000MEYGVI,"Ever since watching The Tamarind Seed in the theater, I've wanted a copy to keep.  Unfortunately, whenever it played on TV, they cut the most-beautiful scene of them walking along the Atlantic side of the island.  Since my husband is a native of Barbados, we know that beach well, and can vouch for the truly breathtaking sea, surf, and rocks!  The story is a wonderful thriller/mystery; and all the way to the end, it will keep you guessing.  This DVD is perfect--and complete.",1305590400,7,478,4.72289156626506
2729302,5,B000MEYGVI,"I remember seeing this Movie years ago and have always wanted a copy of my own.

8168197,5,B000MEYGVI,"Excellent Julie Andrews Movie and an excellent British spy thriller. British spy thrillers from the sixties and seventies tend to be dry, talkie and a bit confusing. Tamarind Seed is in a class all of its own. I highly recommend this movie to everyone not just Julie Andrews fans. It needs to be a single release.",1421539200,,313,4.607142857142857
8168198,5,B000MEYGVI,"This movie seems like one kind of story, and then fools you. 1st you see a sad beautiful woman walking on the beach,with wonderful music in the background. Then she is noticed by her persistent resort/vac. neighbor, and an attraction begins. But soon, the possible love affair has turned into a fast moving suspenseful story that keeps building and building, with numerous twists and turns. Before you realize it, you're holding your breath, because of the growing possibility of violence and danger. This  movie was made approx in 1974, has a very European 1970's feel, with the realistic threat of Cold War violence breaking out any moment. I loved the suspense, so I won't say anymore and spoil it for you. I think this movie is great, and with locations in beautiful Barbados ( still a British Colony In the Atlantic Ocean), Paris ( France ), and London ( UK ). It's written and directed by Blake Edwards, and as usual,he doesn't disappoint.",1421366400,2,945,4.7975460122699385
