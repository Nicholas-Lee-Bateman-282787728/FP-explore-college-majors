7890337,5,6305467277,"My daughter absolutely loves Little Witch books.  This DVD combines the 2 books  ""Little Witch's Big night"" and ""Happy Birthday, Little Witch"".  I can't count the amount of times she has watched this dvd, much less the amount of time I have spent reading all of little witch's books to her.  She is 4 1/2 years old.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a little good clean magic in their life.",1231718400,,420,4.546666666666667
