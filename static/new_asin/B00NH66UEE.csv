8678197,5,B00NH66UEE,"The Classic Archive concept - a technical overview:

Quite apart from the considerable musical content of this disc, the huge playing time of some 14 hours probably needs some explanation for those not totally familiar with Blu-ray capacity. The Blu-ray format has a capacity of several DVDs in just the same way that DVDs have more capacity than VHS tapes and, in an earlier generation, LP (long playing) records had much greater capacity than 78 rpm records

The greater capacity can be used in two ways. Usually it is used to carry High Definition files which, because of their high definition, require much more capacity. However, it would be just as possible for the Blu-ray disc to use its greater capacity to have much longer playing times when the source material is of lower resolution and thus requiring less capacity per item.

That is what has happened here. The original source material is that of television broadcasts taped on video tape and at the quality associated with television broadcasts largely from the 1960's but with further examples from the 1950's and one from the 1970's. Videotape could be described as Low Definition by contrast with modern High Definition recordings. Consequently we are able to experience all that broadcast material conveniently gathered together on a single disc.

Audio-video recording has been an area of great advancement since these live broadcast recordings were made. The archive recordings presented here are standard definition recordings but made at a time of infancy in that area of recording. Modern standard definition recording, let alone HD recording, is vastly superior and fundamentally a totally different product in terms of recording quality. In addition, those wishing for equivalent audio recording, LP or CD source, from the 1950's and 1960's will be greatly disappointed.

That is, however, to miss the point entirely. These recordings derive from largely English and French broadcasting of very limited audio-video quality by any modern standards but of high value in terms of archive footage which is otherwise unavailable. It is on that specific basis that these recordings must be judged and will appeal mainly to collectors with that interest in mind.

The singers and other musicians - a general introduction:

On this disc we are introduced to the work of the following key singers - Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Gundula Janowitz, Regine Crespin, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Rita Streich, Julia Varady, Boris Christoff, Teresa Berganza, Irmgard Seefried, Tito Gobbi, Wolfgang Windgassen and Victoria de los Angeles. Additionally there are also extended examples of the conductors, Karl Richer, Giulini and Mackerras and the pianist, Gerald Moore working with singers plus a handful of other singers of repute not individually credited on the disc headings but well documented in the accompanying booklet. That booklet in the source of much invaluable background information and is particularly well written.

The singers have been chosen as representative of a period which many enthusiasts often refer back to as something of a golden age. Many will be unfamiliar to modern younger collectors so this compilation constitutes an invaluable resource for those and for older collectors.

In a review of a disc of this duration and coverage it would be invidious to single out items of superior merit. However it is fair and essential to note that each singer is well represented with some core personal repertoire and that the 'live' nature of the broadcast material ensures a degree of special frisson which, for many, will overcome the obvious deficiencies of the recordings of those times.

..........................................................................

The musical contents - a summary overview:

There is a fairly even balance of operatic and lieder repertoire throughout this disc with most singers receiving examples of their expertise in all relevant areas. The largest amount of playing time falls to Schwarzkopf. She is shown performing her key operatic roles including Mozart and Strauss (Rosenkavalier) as well as copious lieder examples with Gerald Moore.

Gerald Moore also features with Berganza (Falla), Julius Patzak (tenor), Hans Hotter (bass-baritone), Christa Ludwig (mezzo-soprano), Fischer-Dieskau and de los Angeles. All of those are examples of exemplary recital work and yield musically definitive results. The degree to which recital and lieder repertoire was featured by many of the singers illustrated on this disc who are otherwise familiar as operatic singers may well come as a surprise to some collectors. This divergence of repertoire also extends to the range of operatic examples. As a result these singers from the not-too-distant past are shown to be more broadly based than one might suppose without this collection of archive material.

There are a few complete works which must feature the work of the associated conductors as much as the individual singers. These include the famous performances of the Verdi Requiem (1964) and Four Sacred Pieces (1968) with Giulini as well as the whole Brahms Requiem under Karl Richer from 1964. Mackerras is featured with Der Rosenkavalier Act 1 (1961) as well as work he did for the BBC with Gobbi singing Puccini and Verdi (1958). These broadcasts especially will be familiar with collectors of this series of Classic Archive material as short extracts have been used elsewhere.

The examples of Julia Varady, otherwise known as Fischer-Dieskau's wife, form the subject of documentary films by Bruno Monsaingeon from 1996 and 1998 and are taken from late in her career when she had left the operatic stage and turned to recital work exclusively.

Conclusion:

This compilation of Classic Archive examples of famous singers mainly taken from the 1960's proves to be, yet again, to be an invaluable resource for all collectors interested in such a history. The playing time is generous, the musical examples have been well and fairly chosen as representative of the individual performers and the accompanying booklet is unusually informative in giving clear background coverage. The restoration of the film and sound is as good as it is likely to be.

In conclusion therefore, this disc deserves to be of considerable interest to all collectors interested in this subject and represents good value.
