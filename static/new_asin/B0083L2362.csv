8524565,1,B0083L2362,Do not buy this video.  Complete manipulation of Armenian history and only a few minutes long.  Half the movie is blank screen with music playing in the background.  I don't understand how sometime like this would make it to Amazon.,1416787200,,232,4.75
8524566,5,B0083L2362,"The Armenian Genocide & Romans Armenians and The Coming of the Messiah by the same director. I viewed both of these works in one sitting and was amazed at the delightful learning experience.  If you love art, cinema, history, science, metaphysics, theology, and music, landing here is lucky coincidence. I had heard about Mr. Bedrosian's 2 recent films, '1915 The Armenian Genocide' and 'Romans Armenians and The Coming of the Messiah', but it wasn't until I chanced upon a youtube trailer that I finally took the time to purchase them. I did not expect to give either film more than one viewing, then add them to my collection.  To my and my film aficionado friends' delight, we proceeded to study these two gems with admiration.  There is something new to be learned each time we view them.

Although the subject matter is predictably intense, Mr. Bedrosian executes a multi millennial composition of, not only the history, but existential nature of this ancient race that has survived the grandeur and calamities incessantly brewing in the world's most active historical crossroads of the Caucuses.  The culture that brought so much value and enlightened progress to the human race, theology, mythology, technological and social progress, integration of cultures and races, is finally presented in it's multi- dimensional splendor through a rare and captivating cinematic time transedence technique, flawlessly executed.  Lovers and students of film, get ready for a treat.

Mr. Bedrosian, an accomplished director and cinematographer, is also an artist and visionary historian.  In these, his latest works, he has utilized his far reaching knowledge and insight of history with his gifts and experience in technical cinematic production and fine art. This combination of talent all in one rendition, alone, would be reason enough to study and enjoy  these films.

In the classical format of a docudrama, the '1915...' film contains IMAX sequence, original historic footage I have not found anywhere else, and superb cinematography, photography, and the list goes on.  To top it off, the art film is shot in 70 mm film, making it a rare artistic gem that will be a subject of study and admiration in our collection for all generations to come.

For anyone interested in film, history, art, music, composition, this is a must have.  Mr. Bedrosian, please offer an exhibition of your art and possibly reproductions suitable for framing.  I will purchase more copies for unique gifts to select individuals.",1373500800,,2506,5.170792079207921
8524567,5,B0083L2362,"Tour-de-force historical performance through art and music. Shot on 65mm negative!! The quality of the images and power of the art and subject matter, tweak the senses. Mr. Bedrosian's masterful direction has taken a delicate and tough subject matter and made it very entertaining and thought provoking. By far, the most definitive and comprehensive film on this topic that you will ever see. Hat's off to Mr. Bedrosian!",1338768000,,420,5.1911764705882355
