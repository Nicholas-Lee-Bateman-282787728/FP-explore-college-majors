5108871,5,B007RKFXWQ,"I am a fan of Shazzan from way back. I especially like the character's powers and how Shazzan often laughed in the face of his enemies(because he knew he had the power to defeat them). I also like the twins and the flying camel and how Shazzan and others interacted with them. This had action, comedy and kept my interest. Shazzan is a different kind of superhero(arabic) which goes to show that a superhero doesn't have to be fit into a (WASP) stereotype which gives a broader range to the character. I would highly recommend this cartoon to anyone who likes fantasy, superheroes, the arabian knights or just wants to see something different and enjoyable. Try Shazzan. I think you'll like it!",1347235200,2,694,4.69672131147541

5108875,5,B007RKFXWQ,"Shazzan is a great Hanna-Barbera cartoon.  Unlike many, but not all, of Hanna-Barbera cartoons, each episode of Shazzan was new and fresh - there was a new villain each episode.  That helped keep this series fresh, and the kiddies (and adults) interested.  Series like ""The Perils of Pauline Pitstop,"" for example, had the same villain each week, to wit, the Hooded Claw.  And although a couple of villains had recurring roles, it was basically a new episode each week with Shazzan, Chuch, Nancy and Kabubie (sp?).

The animation, as other reviewers have noted, was typical high quality from Hanna-Barbera.  Hanna-Barbera was prolific in the field of of animation - I'm glad Shazzan was among their cartoon repertoire.  Hope you enjoy it!",1339113600,7,738,5.049586776859504
5108876,5,B007RKFXWQ,"Shazzan was one of my all time favorite cartoons as a child, and I have been waiting patiently for the series to be put out on DVD.  As with all of Hanna Barbera cartoons, the animation quality and characters are excellent. I'm slowly building up my Hanna Barbera collection, and I'm very glad to be able to add this one to it. If you are a fan of Hanna Barbera, then this is a series that you absolutely need to have in your collection.

5108877,4,B007RKFXWQ,"I never watched ""Shazzan"" growing up, and that is saying something from a cartoon junky like me. I would watch pretty much anything animated.  I watched all of the other Hanna Barbara shows; ""The Herculoids,"" ""Space Ghost,"" ""Birdman,"" "" Frankenstein Jr.,"" ... but not ""Shazzan"".  I refused to watch it because I was a huge Captain Marvel fan, and the whole Shazam / Shazzan thing offended my sensibilities.  (I was a true geek even as a kid, apparently).

Older and wiser now, I took the plunge and dove into this long-shunned Alex Toth production, and found an excellent, goofy, and surprisingly edgy late `60s cartoon.

The `60s and `70s wasn't exactly the greatest time for American cartoons.  Budgets were tight, techniques were limited, and simplistic stories were recycled over and over again. ""Shazzan"" is no different, and repeats a basic magic item / unfulfilled quest scenario for all 36 episodes.  Everything you need to know about the story is summed up in the preamble that runs before every episode:

""Inside a cave off the coast of Maine, Chuck and Nancy find a mysterious chest containing the halves of a strange ring. When joined the ring forms the word Shazzan and with this magical command they are transported back to the fabled land of the Arabian Nights. Here they meet their genie, Shazzan. Shazzan presents them Kaboobie a magical flying camel and gives Chuck a magic belt and rope. Shazzan will serve them whenever they call, but he cannot return them home until they deliver the ring to it's rightful owner. And thus begins their incredible journey.""

Who is that rightful owner?  The story never says. Just a macguffin to keep the plots churning. The saving grace for many of these `60s/'70s shows is design, humor, and imagination.  All of which ""Shazzan"" has in spades.

It goes without saying that Alex Toth is one of the great comic designers, and he obviously had fun playing around with the world of the Arabian Nights.  Some of the magic is pulled straight from the original stories, some from Toth's imagination.

 The Arabian Nights is a rich playground for the imagination, and ""Shazzan"" has everything you could want: Flying carpets, magical eggs, rocs, evil wizards--and flying camels. There is something about winged camels that is inherently cool.  if you have ever read Neil Gaimen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sandman/dp/B000MW3XIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sandman</a>&nbsp;story Ramadan, then you know that this is the world bartered away to the king of dreams so that it could live forever in humanities' dreams. It is a pure fantasy land. (Disney's animators must have watching as well.  The entire plot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aladdin/dp/B003V5HWWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aladdin</a>&nbsp;appears to have been lifted from an episode of ""Shazzan"".)

And while Chuck and Nancy are typical bland white-bread heroes, Shazzan himself is awesome.  He has enough magical power that he could just snap his fingers and put things to right, but this all-powerful genie has a sense of humor and cruelty.  There is actually an edge to ""Shazzan"" that surprised me, and that I don't think I would have noticed as a kid.  The great genie delightfully torments the episode's villain and plays with them like a cat with a mouse. With a hearty ""Ho ho ho ho!"" he re-shapes their bodies or tears down their homes or leaves them stranded in the desert to die.

This ""Shazzan"" DVD has all 36 episodes, pulled from the Warner Archives collection.  Obviously they didn't spend a lot of time and money restoring these cartoons, but everything looks nice enough to enjoy.  They did actually put together a bonus feature, a short documentary called ""The Power of Shazzan"" (again with the Captain Marvel references! Grumble grumble!), which basically has a bunch of industry folks talking about working on ""Shazzan"" and watching it as a kid.

I was also surprised to find out that my wife knew ""Shazzan"".  American cartoons rarely make the leap, but apparently ""Shazzan"" was popular in Japan.  My wife actually always assumed it was a Japanese cartoon. But hey, flying camels are popular everywhere, so that is entirely appropriate.",1338508800,33,4267,5.255162241887906

As a little kid I always wished I could have a genie like Shazzan that I could summon to help me deal with bullies or to get out of tricky situations.  I love Kabooby, with the cute noise that he makes - Don Messick making a pre-Scooby Doo babble.  The villains are nasty pieces of work and quite memorable, especially the Master of Thieves, and Mercuraad with his winged feet.  While cartoons of the 60s lacked the special effects of today and were made with limited budgets, they are much better than the ones of today and actually have proper storylines.",1437782400,,670,4.5041322314049586

5108893,5,B007RKFXWQ,"I was a kid when this series came out, and remember one of the happiest times watching Saturday morning TV was the CBS Cartooniverse schedule that started around 8AM and lasted until Noon,you could not tear me away from this.  It was all pure action, super heroes of various kinds and types, from Frankenstein Jr, Space Ghost (coming in for a second season), Herculoids, Birdman and Mightor.  Included was Shazzan, it was a little lower on my list (Frankenstein Jr and the Impossibles were at the dead bottom, then and now) but fun nonetheless.  Two clean cut American twins transported to the Arabian Nights where the whole danger is magical and full of evil (and ethnic).  Shazzan their Genie sees all, knows all (except how to find the true owner of their ring so they could get back home to Maine).  As it ended they were to find the Wizard of the 7th Mountain who could THEN tell them how to find the owner of the ring.  As I remember they saved a wise man who could only direct them to the Wizard of the 6th mountain (they're not connected/in a row?).

All this action was not to last, parents complained of violence and the next season Scooby Doo premiered and I just knew things weren't going to never be the same again (However you feel about Scooby Doo, there is no action there).  I now realize that the battles in Shazzan were a little stretched out, to make room for a 10-12 minute Cartoon (the Herculoids were the only other series that was also exclusive).  Perhaps something could've gone in the middle (The Arabian nights from the old Banana Splits show would've made a nice middle cartoon).

I'm beginning not to like the special features extra. They were quite detailed when it was Space Ghost and Birdman but when it came to the Herculoids and Shazzan, the guys they interview stumble over the facts and names you have to wonder did they actually watch the cartoon and if they did, could they brush up on it before the interview (might be more convincing), some start to get a little sarcastic  about the plot lines and such, and I know these weren't the best cartoons in the world and the animation has improved, but you are trashing my childhood here (especially since not all of them look old enough to have watched it when they were first released like I did), many of them tend to be more Alex Toth fans then Hanna Barbara (which became more generic and criticized as the years went along).

There are people who are older then me who are really nostalgic about the old George Reeves Superman show, as silly as it looks to modern effects it's really tacky to tease them for being captivated to the show as kids. I feel the same way about my own cartoons and feel the guys they interview don't always keep that in mind.

It seems the whole Cartooniverse series is out on DVD and I'm enjoying a lost era.",1431043200,,2827,4.487329434697855

5108895,5,B007RKFXWQ,"I'm writing this review since Warner archive is no longer advertising SHAZZAN but selling it on amazon . com! Where else can you find a flying camel, two teenaqegers and a magical giant genie in the same show? SHAZZAN!! I bought it on Warner Archive when it came out and have been enchanted with Alex Toth's character designs for the show ever since

Whether the kids are fighting with sorcerers or out witting sexy enchantreses Shazzan helps them defeat them as a powerful genie can! I disagree with the special feature on Shazzan. The animaters don't get the appeal of a genie who can defeat any adversary with the wave of his hand and the blink of an eye!!

Whether Shazzan would hang Cyclops by their feet out to dry or tranform an evil genie into a butterfly and have him swallowed by a flower in order to capture him into a bottle Shazzan has fun surprises for the viewer!

While Scooby Doo solved dull mysteries and faced non real monsters, Shazzan's villains were a real threat and used real magic to threaten our teenage heroes! Each episode had two adventures and the brother and sister would call up Shazzan to dispose of the monster or help them escape the villains clutches! Hanna Barbera came up colorful arabian night backrounds and characters for Chuck and Nancy and Shazzan to defeat! Check out Shazzan and see for yourself the magic of an all powerful genie!",1430179200,,1376,4.631147540983607
5108896,4,B007RKFXWQ,"Thanks to my Dad, I've always been a huge fan of the classic Hanna Barbara cartoons, specifically their superhero/action shows, such as ""Space Ghost"", ""The Impossibles"", and ""Jonny Quest"".  For the time, the animation was pretty good, and the art styles often evoked a comic book  or pulp magazine feel.

This series told the story of two siblings, Chuck and Nancy, who discover a pair of magic rings that, when put together, summon an all powerful genie named Shazzan. Upon their discovery, the kids are magically transported to the ancient times of the Arabian knights, and in order to get home, they must return the ring to its rightful owner.  Naturally, being a continuing, Saturday morning cartoon, they never did make it home, but none the less, every episode is packed with action and adventure, as the kids travel around on a magic flying camel named Kaboobie (that sounds a bit like Scooby Doo).  I always liked Kaboobie, thinking the concept was a bit more unique and original than just giving the kids a magic carpet.

Pretty much every episode involves some villain trying to steal the rings to possess the genie, and/or separate the kids so they can't summon Shazzan (to which the plans always fail).  Once Shazzan comes, the threat is pretty much over, as really nothing can defeat him. Had this been made now a days, I'd be more picky about the plot holes and characterization and such, but considering the time period, as well as the fact that this is pretty much on the level of ""Scooby Doo"", it is what it is. Shallow as some of the plots and characters might be, it's still nothing short of fun.

If you're a Hanna Barbara fan, this is a nice set to add to your collection.  It's made print on demand, so barring one short special feature (an interview with Bruce Timm and some other animators inspired by these old cartoons), you just get all the episodes (the quality of which is pretty crisp and clear).  Here's hoping Warner Bros. decides to remake some of these classic cartoons, as they really deserve a comeback, and we need more than just another incarnation of Scooby Doo, folks.",1429920000,3,2108,4.688346883468835

5108913,3,B007RKFXWQ,"I'll start off admitting that I have NOT purchased any of these. However, I likely never would. First off, these are just ripped copies, basically (read the other reviews, I mean, c'mon), there are no extras, no real reason to purchase a DVD (as opposed to locating a stream of these ... um ... somewhere ... wink wink). Anyway, I HAVE viewed several of these in the past year and I can honestly say that ""Shazzan"" is one of the better 60s Saturday morning cartoons. Alas, the best of the bunch, though, were actually those picked up from prime time (Top Cat, The Jetsons, Jonny Quest) or theatrical shorts in edited format for TV (Bugs Bunny, Heckle & Jeckle, Tom & Jerry).

However, the strength of ""Shazzan"" is in the topic (fantasy-adventure), the characters (well, of the main characters, only the genie, himself, achieves success here, but he's an important part of the whole), and the mature theme (these were one of those that caused the powers that be to dumb down the 70s). Although each episode produced similar plotting, the situations varied somewhat and the battle between Shazzan and the villain was something of a Game of Thrones twist for the younger set. In the end, I can honestly say that if I acquired a perfect Saturday morning set, this would be one of a few that I would pick from this period.",1407628800,,1317,4.628205128205129

5108927,5,B007RKFXWQ,"The Shazzan series along with Space Ghost and Dino Boy, Moby Dick and the Mighty Mightor, and Jonny Quest are for me the classics of Hanna- Barbera cartoons.

Each of us had our favorite characters, we knew their names, their talents, the story line as to how the characters started out on their journey and that they always were on the side of right. Even the music for these cartoons stirs up memories of what was going to come, excitement, adventure, using super skills and setting things back on the right road. Many times wrong choices were made by some of the characters, however there was always someone to help. It didn't end there because lessons were learned and a consequence always follows. I think that is what is missing in the Saturday morning cartoons today. I've seen some of the cartoon that children watch today and to me they are very scary and have no substance. The classic cartoons of Hanna-Barbera have a timeless quality.",1372118400,10,1045,4.779005524861878
5108928,3,B007RKFXWQ,"I'll be perfectly honest here: I only bought the series so that I could show people how obnoxious it was for characters to get into trouble, and then have some huge, omnipotent, invincible trump card summoned to kick evil's butt. Don't get me wrong: I liked certain things about Shazzan; it had mystical settings, plenty of villains, heroic friends, and more magical effects than you can shake a stick at. It's just that, as a hero, that genie is questionable at best. He defeats any and all foes too easily and effortlessly, often turning them into creatures or inanimate objects in the process, and what's more, he enjoys doing it! Still, probably the biggest letdown of getting the series is the fact that it only works in a dvd player that's hooked up to the television.",1371168000,,774,4.698529411764706

5108937,5,B007RKFXWQ,"From the moment this show appeared, I loved it. The whole idea of an Arabian Nights-style dimension was very intriguing to me. Shazzan is the type of friend we all want--someone we can depend on, someone who always knows the answer, someone who can pull a few strings, and his magical powers don't hurt, either. At the beginning of each show, we are told about how Chuck and Nancy discovered the magic rings that summon Shazzan. I was sort of hoping that in the last show of the series, they'd make it back home. They don't! It seems that they're stuck forever in that pseudo-Arabian land. Oh well, with Shazzan nearby, maybe it's not that bad after all.

I've waited for years and years and years for this show to become available on DVD. Now that it has, I'm very satisfied. The picture and sound are excellent!",1350691200,,813,4.530612244897959

8521400,5,B007RKFXWQ,"This  is  truly  a  genie  who  expresses  laughter  when  facing  his  enemies,  without  any  fear  of  defeat.  He  has  made  it  his  quest  to  do  what  no  other  genie  would  do  or  think  of.  Chuck  &  Nancy  found  the  lamp  &  discovered  a  genie  like  no  other,  He  does  much  more  then  make  wishes.  He  is  a  constant  body  guard  to  Chuck  &  Nancy  every  time  they  put  the  ring  halves  together  &  call  out  his  name,  up  until  they  return  the  lamp  &  Shazzan  to  its  rightful  owner,  only  then  will  he  send  them  home.  Chuck  &  Nancy's  own  tricks  include  (The  cloak  of  invisibility)  &  (A  magic  rope)  &  a  flying  camel  named  Kabooby  created  by  Shazzan.
No  matter  what  his  foes  try  to  do  they  never  gain  very  much  of  an  advantage  over  Shazzan.
I  think  that's  what  I  like  about  the  show.
All  the  jokes  Shazzan  comes  up  with  while  he's  facing  them.  He's  never  really  too  serious  when  they  try  to  match  his  powers.  Shazzan  only  makes  it  look  like  he's  over  &  done  with  just  for  a  few  seconds,  before  returning  to  finish  off  his  foe.
Chuck  &  Nancy  I  like  them  too.
I  think  Aladdin  &  the  other  genie  in  both  those  movies  is  flat  out  Stupid.
This  one  has  more  to  it  as  far  as  adventure  goes.
I  love  this  show.  Never  gets  old.",1503705600,2,1400,4.073275862068965
