7951574,5,B00005R24A,"When a university researcher is found with a briefcase full of money after committing suicide, a British intelligence officer believes the man was a traitor, but his colleagues think his research into sensory deprivation may have effected his mind. To prove their point, one of them (Dirk Bogarde) agrees to repeat the experiment with himself as the test subject. Part way through the experiment the intelligence officer realizes this could be used for brainwashing and, to test his belief, tells the subject that his wife is unfaithful -- with tragic results. The film is an excellent psychological drama, but with little action as much of the film concerns the disintegration of the couple's marriage. The DVD has been out of print for several years.",1403568000,,752,5.07258064516129
7951575,3,B00005R24A,I bought this because Emilia fox was in it and I was interested to see what she did with her part. I guess it's a type of sci-fi movie...quirky at least so has some appeal for me.,1385424000,,179,3.864864864864865
7951576,3,B00005R24A,"Hard to believe that Dirk Bogarde would forget Mary Ure, even after an extended stay in a hot bath! Rejoice! He will fall in love again after having helped her to give birth to their fourth child. An interesting Relph/Dearden movie of the early 60's. Recommended.",1331078400,2,263,4.739130434782608
7951577,4,B00005R24A,"Ostensibly a run-of-the-mill espionage thriller with radical science flourishes, after 30 minutes of the aforementioned , ""The Mind Benders"" turns into a harrowing treatise on marital love, which apparently needs a lot of smoke, mirrors and hapless hope to survive. The ending is far from ""happy,"" as the audience feels like they've braved a wet weekend of ghost stories at the end of this nifty littly thriller!!",1123804800,5,413,5.17910447761194
7951578,3,B00005R24A,"In spite of the obviously psychedelic packaging for this film, The Mind Benders is marginally science fiction.  Instead, this is a drama with SF trappings.  The story of a scientist, Dr. Longman, played by Dirk Bogarde, who comes to believe that the suicide of a colleague was caused by prolonged exposure in a sensory deprivation tank, he is forced to prove his theory by a British intelligence agent and undergo the same treatment himself.
The agent is convinced that Longman's colleague was a spy and engages in some subtle brainwashing of Longman after he's spent eight hours in the tank.  While the opening half hour is definitely gripping--including Longman's harrowing experience in the tank--the final two thirds of the film is sorely disappointing for science fiction fans--or even for those who are expecting a substantial buildup focused on the theme.
The development after the first 30 minutes or so is pretty weak, centering on Longman's relationship with his wife which has been put to the test, and is a real letdown.  Although Dirk Bogarde and Mary Ure as his wife are more than competent actors, the film runs out of steam long before its happy ending.
The real value of this film, as indicated in the liner notes of the DVD, is that it is a precursor to Altered States and The Manchurian Candidate.  For completists who want whatever film they can find about brainwashing, this is a must.  For anyone else, it's really not great.  A far better vehicle for Dirk Bogarde fans, also available on DVD, is The Servant.",1009497600,7,1531,4.842911877394636
