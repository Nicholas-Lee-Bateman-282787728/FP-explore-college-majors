8755106,5,B01D7A1R88,"I found this to be a good workout for an older woman.  Works all the muscles as well as your balance.
 I have been working out at home since 1/1/1987, yes, 1987.  Bought my first Fonda tape at Crazy Eddie's on 1/1/87.  Then I added weights to my workouts in the 1990s using The Firm tapes.  I was in great shape!  But as I have aged (I am 65), I have exercised less and less -because I hurt my shoulder, knee, took a tumble on the step and so on.  I started to feel out of shape, not fat, just out of shape.  I knew I needed to start doing something to keep my muscles working and more importantly help with my balance which has really been off.  This workout is really good.  It's not high tech at all so be prepared.  BUT you will get as much of a workout as you want - a little or a lot!",1486425600,7,790,3.875
