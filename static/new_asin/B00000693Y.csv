1193096,3,B00000693Y,"I ordered this, because I don't remember seeing it in Finland and because of the great actors. I mean: Kevin Kline, Harvey Keitel AND Alan Rickman! What more could a grown woman want?
The movie uses clichs with a twist: a heroic but difficult cop (Kline) who has been unjustly sacked and is now a fireman, but - being a genius in his work - gets called back to solve mysterious killings. Of course, the police department is against the idea. But there is no choice and he starts to work in his own terms, for instance bringing along an assistant, a moody artist (Rickman in a part where he speaks very little, which is always a shame). Brother (Keitel) isn't too thrilled either, because they still love the same woman (Sarandon). Mayor's daughter (Mastrantonio) gets sucked in, because her friend is murdered.
The movie has all the elements of comedy, humour, suspense and good actors and actresses - and still it misses something. Kline is fine as always and even in this small part Rickman makes an impression and it's hard to point out any flaws - but still it doesn't work as well as it could have.
Anyway, the movie is entertaining, not bad at all. Harmless fun with a couple of original jokes. Kline's cooking is very odd and Rickman's use of models even more personal.",1062028800,12,1276,4.576419213973799
1193097,4,B00000693Y,"This movie got savaged (and continues to be) when it first came out. I think that with all the talent involved, people were expecting something a lot more... mainstream. This is one of those oddball detective/crime thrillers a la The Long Goodbye or Trixie that just doesn't fit in anywhere. It blends genres together and this bugged a lot of people who just wanted a by-the-numbers story.
Everyone in the cast is fantastic but the real standout, for me, is Alan Rickman cast totally against type as the slightly effeminate artiste (and computer genius), Ed. Rickman gets most of the best lines and steals every scene he's in. He and Kline play well off each other and it's a shame this film tanked because I'd have loved to see more adventures with these two.
The DVD is a real disappointment. No extras. Nothing! Just dumped unceremoniously on DVD. Oh well. At least it's letterboxed!",1049155200,17,886,4.759740259740259
1193098,4,B00000693Y,"How can a movie go wrong with Kevin Kline and Susan Sarandon in lead roles? For this movie, apart from the solid performance of these two topnotch actors, I think the plot also deserves some credit, it builds up just enough suspense to keep me guessing and tingling to the end -- exactly the way I felt with mystery hits like ""Kiss The Girls"", ""The Bone Collector"", ""Presumed Innocent"" etc... Let's just bear in mind that what Kevin Kline offers here is completely different from his widely acclaimed, even Oscar-winning, roles (""The Big Chill"" or ""A Fish Called Wanda""), and that would only got us to admire his amazing versatility even more.",1042588800,,643,4.75
1193099,4,B00000693Y,"I became reacquainted with ""January Man"" recently and forgot what a good film it is.  With Oscar winners, Kevin Kline, Susan Sarandon and an excellent supporting cast including Rod Steiger, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Danny Aiello and Harvey Keitel and a great script, director Pat Connor had an easy task of producing a great film.  With a touch of comic relief between the suspense and the strong rivalry between brothers (Kline and Keitel), Keitel is forced by the Mayor (Steiger) to rehired his brother (Kline) as the lead investigator to find and stop a serial killer.  Time is running out and the suspense builds. Like the Bone Collector, the January Man will challenge the viewer until the end.  You'll find the January Man more challenging to solve than most mysteries, but keep in mind the clues are in front of you, including its title. If you enjoy a good mystery, January Man is worth the time.  Rated R for a sex scene, brief nudity and violence.",1022457600,6,960,4.793939393939394
1193100,1,B00000693Y,"It's obvious that Kevin Kline was trying to capitalize on his success in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" when he signed on to play the lead in ""The January Man.""
Sadly, the success isn't repeated.
Kline, inspired as the crazy hit-man in ""Fish,"" is singularly uninspired as the offbeat cop in ""January."" This is a cast with tons of promise, but with little plot and less script to aid them. Alan Rickman's character is potentially the most interesting, but even he lacks dimension.
After flopping in the departments of comedy and romance, the only possible salvation for ""The January Man"" is its potential as a thriller. Kline does have just enough charisma to possible keep you watching all 97 dreary minutes. But beware: the ending is a complete disappointment and left me angry -- both at Kline and Co. for producing this mind-numbing junk, and at myself for wasting both time and money on such a bad movie.",1012953600,5,899,4.732484076433121
1193101,4,B00000693Y,"This is one of those movies that holds your attention precisely because you are anticipating, and keep waiting for it to get better, but it just  never quite comes together.  Sort of like watching a drunk try to put a key  in a lock- it can be annoying and yet entertaining at- the same time.  And  in that odd, uncomfortable emotion is the strange appeal of this work.  Rod  Stiger has one scene, wherein he expresses displeasure with some of Klein's  antics, that is so superbly, ""over-acted,"" I found it riveting.  This movie is not for everyone, for sure, but if you can appreciate the  eclectic and obtuse caricatures as being entertainment, you might just love  it.  If you are expecting ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" don't bother.",967766400,3,730,4.661417322834645
1193102,5,B00000693Y,"This is a very funny movie while at the same time, it's very riveting. You root for the good guys, you love it when the bad guys get theirs'. Kline's  character is a mixture of tough love and eccentric genius. He and his love  interests play well off each other. All the supporting stars around Kline  do a top rate job and leave the circle unbroken. Allan Rickman is really  funny as a way offbeat artist who gets roped in to helping Kline figure out  where and when the serial killer is going to strike. The final scene  between the killer and Kline is somewhat slapstickish but also a  choreographed ballet that would make the old silent stars proud. I've  watched this movie many times and I never get tired of it. I know many of  the lines by heart but I can always find something small and wonderful I  missed the time before. I hope Kline and this group do more of the same.  This movie would love a sequel! As Allan Rickman's character, Ed, says,  ""I'm going to go and try to paint something original."" This movie  paints an original and fresh twist to the Sherlock Holmes theme and other  favorite whodunit plot points as well.",965088000,4,1136,4.399038461538462
1193103,1,B00000693Y,"Terrible - Good actors with bad material. How do you go wrong with Kevin Kline, Susan Sarandon, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (I haven't liked her in anything else, but she was actually good here), Harvey Keitel, Rod Steiger,  and Danny Aiello ? Put them in a movie with a terrible screenplay and  nothing to do. Kline plays a former cop, now fireman, and brother of the  New York City police commissioner (Keitel - do these two look like brothers  at all - NO!), who is called back on the force to stop a serial killer.  Sarandon is Keitel's wife and was Kline's lover, and Mastrantonio is  falling for our Kevin. The worst (over)acting job goes to Steiger, who  seethes like a rabid dog throughout the whole movie. Anyway, to catch this  creep, Kline uses methods so unbelievable (not in a good way) that you'll  be shaking your head.

1193104,4,B00000693Y,"For the first time I can remember, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin about a movie.  Janurary Man is a good movie, in my opinion, for the very reasons that he says it isn't.  The comedic parts are funny, but  don't overlap into the more dramatic areas of the story and vice versa.  Kevin Kline (one of my favorites) does his usual outstanding job, but Alan  Rickman steals this movie.  I'm not one to advise on movies....each  person's tastes are different, and thank the Maker for that, but rent  it...watch it...then decide for yourself.  My highest rating I can give  any movie is the following.....""I'd buy the DVD!"".  The  Janurary Man is one of these.",929491200,2,662,4.612068965517241

1193128,1,B00000693Y,A terrific cast hampered by a laughingly preposterous plot.

1193129,1,B00000693Y,"If you ever want to see a movie where a good script was destroyed by the wrong director, it's not likely you could come up with a better specimen than The January Man.  The script was clearly intended as a breezy mystery comedy in the mode of 1940's films where the eccentric amateur detective was a thousand times smarter than the official cops and was able to figure out things that were far beyond their limited imaginations and talents.

Unfortunately director Pat O'Connor doesn't seem to have a clue that he's directing a comedy or that his film is meant to be breezy and fun.  He tends to over direct everyone to the point that many of the performances are genuinely painful--Susan Sarandon, Danny Aiello, and Rod Steiger are simply awful--they seem to think they are in a Eugene O'Neill play.  This is a comedy/thriller people--not a deep dish drama.

Writer John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck) famously hated this movie and put the blame for its failure squarely on the director's back, saying that Pat O'Connor talked a good game but in the end didn't understand the script at all.  That's obvious enough when you're watching the movie--which is clever on paper but a disaster in the execution.

The story involves a disgraced cop turned fireman named Nick Starkey (Kevin Kline, one of the only actors in the film who seem to understand what type of film he was supposed to be making) who is brought back to solve a string of serial murders because the police are getting nowhere and the body count is rising to such an extent that the mayor and the chief of police are in jeopardy of losing their jobs.  Nick Starkey is eccentric but he's also a genius--and it takes all his smarts to solve the crimes which involve some genuinely oblique clues that you would need to be Sherlock Holmes to pick up on.

Unless you are a student of film and want to see how badly a movie can go wrong even if you start out with a solid script this is definitely not worth sitting through.  January Man is heavy handed where it should be breezy, plodding where it should be brisk, melodramatic where it should simply be fun.  It's a mess, but all movies can't turn out well and this is one of the bad ones.",1468886400,,2196,4.534177215189874

His career depends on Nick's acceptance. Nick returns to his apartment and finds visitors there (for the light). The Mayor explains his policies and exercises his powers. A woman visits Nick Strayer and looks at his books. [Can you tell about a person by his/her readings?] Did Nick forgive Franklin for making him the fall guy? Nick and Christine argue over their past. Nick was blames in a scandal. His new office is redecorated!

Detective Nick wants all the reports and photographs for all the eleven murders. Also a NEC computer with Lotus Agenda. [Product placement?] He attends Alice Hawkins' funeral. He follows a young woman to an ice-skating rink. They talk. What next? She tells Nick about Allison, they visit the apartment. [That computer dates this movie.] Nick looks at the records of the murder victims. The murderer picked the locks of the victims! What was the motive? Can he figure out the next murder? Nick and Frank argue over who Mom loved more. Bernadette meets Mrs. Starkey. Nick studies the day of the murder, each was on a prime number. But where will the next murder occur? Is there a pattern to these murders? We see another murder. A man goes out a window. He broke a window to get in, unlike the previous eleven murders. The Mayor arrives, Nick explains why this could be the wrong man, but he is ignored. He returns home to find Bernadette. Can he solve the crime anyway? Nick looks at the stars in the skies. Can he get support?

Can Nick get a volunteer as a decoy? Yes. A computer is used to analyze the crime scenes. There is a pattern to the locations. Which floor? There is a tune whose notes fit the locations. Nick prepares a stake-out. They see a man pick a lock! They will send in da decoy instead of the occupant. [Is there a flaw in their plan?] There is a chase down the stairs. Police cars arrive. ""Do you know who I am?"" Nick wraps up the killer for delivery to the police. ""He's nobody"" says Nick. Nick rejects Christine, but she gives him a check. [Was this the missing evidence?] Bernadette kisses Nick. Will they be happy together?

I found parts of this story implausible. Remember what Raymond Chandler said about murders created for a puzzle? The seems based on the story of the ""Boston Strangler"" but modified into a comedy / drama. It is too funny for a murder mystery and too serious for a comedy. Compare this to ""Wrongfully Accused"", a parody of ""The Fugitive"". Does the disguise of the killer seem both false and implausible? Not to mention controversial. Was this the first movie to use a personal computer to help solve a murder?",1374192000,,2968,4.562851782363977

This is a terrible movie with a ridiculous script.  It's a serious drama until the last ten minutes when it becomes low comedy complete with pratfalls and jokes.  Kline phones in his performance; he's never convincing as the returning cop who's expected to solve a case that the entire police force couldn't crack in a year.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays his supposed love interest but she's annoying and there's absolutely no chemistry between them.  (On the plus side, she did marry the director.)  Susan Sarandon bombs as a seductress and Alan Rickman looks like Maynard G. Krebs while Rod Steiger and Danny Aiello ham it up so much it's embarrassing.  Harvey Keitel just wanders around looking lost the whole time.  What a colossal waste of talent.

There is no suspense or romantic tension and certainly no hint of real police work, just a lot of good actors looking foolish in a bad movie.  What a disappointment.",1276214400,3,1056,4.7845303867403315

Alan Rickman is at his best as usual, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio portrays a fairly brave, courageous character willing to assist Kline's character to catch the killer at the risk of her life.

With a touch of suspense, this movie moves along at a comfortable pace, and I must say that my favorite scene is the ""stairwell scene"". Absolutely hilarious!

If you haven't seen The January Man I thoroughly recommend it. The only flaw? Not enough Alan! (But, does any movie he's in ever have enough of him? Not bloody likely!).

Ok. After having read other's reviews of this movie and their thorough dislike of it because it was ""overacted, bad, etc."", I must state that this movie is not supposed to be serious. It is a COMEDY. A semi-stupid comedy, but comedy nonetheless. I found that for what type of movie it is supposed to be, it works very well. It has a good cast (lots of stars), it doesn't take itself overly seriously, and it's just plain FUNNY!

To those that found it disappointing? Perhaps you miss the point. It's not supposed to be a thriller and it's not supposed to be taken seriously as a thriller. In my opinion, the ""bad acting"" by the cast is perhaps supposed to be that way.

As I said previously, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, and I still recommend it for Alan fans and for anyone looking for a comedy that is semi-stupid and satiristic (sp?) of ""serious suspense movies"".

The plot was thin and disjointed, (what do Virgo, prime numbers and Neil Sedaka all have in common?  Did I miss something?) and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting I've seen.

You have a script from Oscar winning writer John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck); a cast any director would die for; and an initially interesting premise.  But even with all that, THE JANUARY MAN is not a good movie.  Shanley's script is so disjointed and the only attempt at comedy seems to be Kline's physical confrontation with the killer.  It takes the movie at least thirty minutes to focus on the killings, and even then, it plods along.  Shanley may have tried to hard to force the genres to work, and it shows.  And director Pat O'Connor should be required to do community service for his mishandling of this talented cast.  Kevin Kline, usually a strong presence in any film, plays Nick Starkey like it was an After School special--bland, unfocused and murky.  Susan Sarandon, who has won an Oscar, tries to be a kind of Julia Roberts femme fatale, but she's about as seductive as a seahorse.  Rod Steiger and Danny Aiello overact so badly, it's hard to believe these gentlemen have given us such good work in the past.  Harvey Keitel needs to play villains if this is how he chooses to embody a ""good guy"" for a change.  Alan Rickman's Ed is stereotypical artiste, but he at least adds some needed color to the movie.  And Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio is pathetically dull and lethargic.

THE JANUARY MAN could have been a good thriller, but under O'Connor's awful direction and Shanley's poorly developed script, it merely becomes one of those classic examples of a good movie gone bad.",1112313600,,1541,4.7481203007518795
1193260,1,B00000693Y,"Comedy?  Thriller?  Suspense?  I guess that these are all words or genres that you could use to describe this film.  I would use these words if I wanted to gloss over the true feeling of this film.  I would use these words if I had to sell this wallow-some film to a distributor who didn't know any better.  I would use these words lightly, because if I ever believed them the battle would be forever lost.  This was not a comedy.  It was not a thriller.  It definitely was not a suspense.  So, what was it?  After viewing this film I came to the conclusion that The January Man reminded me of a puzzle put together by a two-year-old.  While all the pieces were in the box to put together, sadly the infant size brain of the child chose to smash the pieces together instead of place them in corresponding orders.  Thus, you have a jumbled mess with wedged pieces of what could have been an overall beautiful picture.  With poor acting, a confusing plot that literally went nowhere and an ending that felt forced and premature, one can see that this puzzle is unfixable by even the best puzzler in the world.  If I were those involved with the creation, I would definitely be ashamed.

To begin, what was wrong with the actors?  Nobody seemed like they were giving 10% much less 50% of their effort for this film.  Even the great ones like Keitel, Kline, and Sarandon felt like they were walking through the motions with equally confused eyes and hearts.  Kline's New York accent faded in and out throughout the film giving us no glimpse of his actual character.  His role was never fully defined, so the other half of the time that we watch him on screen we just don't care about him at all.  This was one of the worst leading characters of all time.  Thankfully, a completely miscast team that seemed more interested in the money than actually ""acting"" backs him up.  Keitel was horrible in this film.  I am a huge fan of his body of work, but in this one he walked, talked, and gave those emotionless eyes a rest.  He provided nothing of value to this production.  The same can be said about Sarandon, whose character seemed unfocused and undervalued, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who never really got her feet wet in Hollywood until Maid Marion arrived at her doorstep.  Alan Rickman was wasted, as well as the one-leveled voices of Danny Aiello and Rod Steiger whose only direction from Pat O'Conner was to yell.  In other words, if you are interested in seeing this film for the acting, you will be greatly disappointed.

Second, perhaps the acting can be overlooked by a strong story line?  WRONG!  This was the most convoluted script that I have ever seen Hollywood produce.  We spend the first forty minutes learning about an event that happened two years ago that is never fully explained anyway.  It reminded of those times that the teacher would say in class that we should all listen up because this wasn't going to be on the test.  Then why bother.  This set the spiraling downfall for the rest of the film.  This unavailable information also lead to some pretty choppy chemistry between the actors.  I never say Kline and Keitel as brothers.  I never saw the relationship with Sarandon possible.  In fact, now that I think about it, I didn't see any of the actors meshing well together because they were working with a script that was focused on all the wrong parts.  Eventually, The January Man gets so caught up on this secondary story that we find ourselves rushed into an ending and a solution that seems laughable instead of plausible.  We even have a villain that is so confusing that I don't even think he knew what he was doing in the film.  The final thirty minutes of this film were the worst parts of this movie, second to all the parts before that.  Whoever wrote this script must have just forgotten the basic rules of storytelling because nothing meshed well at all.

Finally, I would have to comment that the marketing for this film could feel like a cheated ticket to some filmgoers.  After reading some reviews for this film, I was expecting to find myself chuckling out loud at the antics of Kevin Kline and his spin on the world of investigation.  I was wrong.  There was no humor in this film at all.  Even when O'Conner tried to bring some in, it seemed forced and unhealthy.  I must repeat, this is not a comedy.  It even isn't really that suspenseful, nor is the thrilling aspect actually that thrilling.  I must admit that whomever sold this film to a company under the guise that it was a comedy should be awarded the ""Best Salesman of the Decade"" award.  Somebody believed this film was funny and even pasted a preview to it with the word ""comedy"" written all over it.  Someone sold the company a broken product ... hook, line, and sinker.  I just ask you to beware.

Overall, this film was horrible.  From the poor acting, the cryptic story that needed some form of decoder ring to understand, the passionless actors, to the harshly branded word ""comedy"", January Man proves that not all films should be made and that an advanced screen process should be used regularly.  I genuinely encourage you to skip this film.  No good will come of you watching this mess.  I promise.

1193263,4,B00000693Y,"This movie is not a typical ""mystery thriller,"" at least not in the usual sense of the genre. The characters unravel intriguingly but very fluidly, and it is easy to relate to almost all of them (I bet we can all think of parallels in our own lives.)
Theme-wise it is ostensibly presented as a suspense movie where an ex-cop (Kevin Kline) is re-instated into a homicide detective role to solve a brutal murder spree by a NY psychopath. There is an interesting subplot of unrequited romance between Kline's character and his brother's (who is commissioner of police) wife. Kline's artist friend, his new girl friend (the Mayor's daughter), and in fact the Mayor himself -- are all amusing characters. But Kline is clearly the pivot of the movie, he turned what many might consider a very below standard screenplay and turned it into a very keepable film.
The cinematography is neat, the dialog entertainingly scattershot and the movie flows with a very good pace. Most people who revile this under-rated but actually very watchable movie do so because it doesn't fit any Hollywoodesqe molds. It is not a suspense movie alone (clearly, to me, it didn't make any overt attempts to be) -- it is also a very adult and somewhat intellectual but credible study of multiple intertwined characters.
The ending surprised me a bit, but I don't think it was chinsy or overdone. It was probably supposed to try and imitate real life and I'd say it did so.
