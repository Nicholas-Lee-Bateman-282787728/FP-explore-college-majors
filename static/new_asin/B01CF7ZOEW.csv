It should have been cleaned up.  Too
grainy to really enjoy.",1478304000,,102,4.368421052631579
8752905,3,B01CF7ZOEW,"This is clearly a war propaganda movie and not one of the better ones.  Good guys vs. bad guys, very black and white.  Very shallow characterization and sometimes silly.  I can see why it was so popular during the war, very patriotic and needed at the time.  In this version the picture quality is poor with fading and splotching. If you decide to buy do not get this version as there are better quality choices.",1474761600,,412,4.453333333333333
