8028558,1,B0002KQQ4M,I think these are the same people that put out the fake Koga Sensei videos. Video spends too much time on warm ups - there are better DVDs - not a good purchase,1488844800,,160,3.878787878787879

I won't pretend to be an expert Aikidoka, but I'll offer this persepctive from one who has seen a few different martial arts videos and has attended Aikido classes for less than a year. I don't believe you can learn Aikido from a DVD or book. It's way too subtle. You can enhance your class experience with supplementary material. That said, this is a great video for being introduced to Aikido generally. You get a feel for the art from the video. However, there are several styles of Aikido and even within one style you'll find many differences between each instructor. Therefore, the value of any video will depend on how closely the style matches your schools style and/or what you can learn from seeing the techniques you're learing taught differently.
For those who haven't experienced Aikido classes, there's a lot in Aikido that doesn't focus on breaking limbs and striking is very limited. That may put some people off. However, Aikido is effective (it originates in budo), and rewarding and this video helps explain why.",1322179200,2,1193,4.768115942028985
