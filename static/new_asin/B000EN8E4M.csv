2523810,4,B000EN8E4M,"In this fascinating Bollywood epic about the ""Sepoy Rebellion"" or the ""First War of Indian Independence"" of 1857, in which the Indians who work as mercenaries for the British East India Company rise up against colonial authorities, Aamir Kahn (as the title character) and Toby Stephens (as his white best friend) play buddies-torn-apart roles and overcome the inevitable cliches of the script with the sheer force of their acting. Kahn is touchingly vulnerable and luminously handsome and magnetic as the pristine hero. (The Internet Movie Database entry on MP has an extensive debate on how closely this character corresponds to his historical counterpart and his role in the war/rebellion; it's a complex and controversial issue.) The gorgeous Stephens brings a fierce energy and compassion to his sidekick role as the One Good White Guy who foresees the rebellion and its consequences but is unable to convince anyone else of his dark vision. (Stephens' brief speeches about the ruthlessness of a private corporation pillaging a country seem all too relevant to our own time in this age of Blackwater and Halliburton in Iraq.) The film is wildly entertaining, filled with the color and beauty of Bollywood -- superb cinematography, epic sets and crowd scenes, music-and-dance numbers that pop out of nowhere, and a love story with a few (relatively chaste but sexy) kisses between Stephens and actress/model Amisha Patel. Highly recommended for Toby Stephens fans and for anyone interested in Indian films.",1187136000,20,1509,5.265560165975104
2523811,2,B000EN8E4M,"MANGAL PANDEY IS A DISSOPOINTMENT. THE FILM DOESN'T GO ANY WHERE NEAR TO THE EXPECTATIONS. THE FILM HAS NOTHING INTRUSTING AND NOTHING ENTERTAINING. DULL DIRECTTION AND SCREENPLAY. TOO LONG AND BORING.

  AAMIR KHAN IS SUPERB. HE IS IN FORM YET AGAIN.

  TOBEY STEVENS IS GOOD.

  RANI DOES AN HONEST JOB.

  AMISHA PATEL IS HARDLY THERE.

  DON'T BUY IT.",1144713600,2,355,4.879310344827586
2523812,2,B000EN8E4M,"After being delayed few times, the timing of the release of this film couldn't have been more perfect, just two days before the Indian I-Day(15 August). Any Aamir Khan film is always looked fwd to and it becomes more vivid if he is appearing on celluloid after a gap of four years. Add to this, another name Ketan Mehta who is India's most critically acclaimed director. And to top all this, a historical subject of Mangal Pandey-the first crusader of the first war of Indian Independence.

Indian history has witnessed innumerable martyrs, whose names are easily forgotten or never mentioned. Such people's sacrifices needs more than just a mention in school's history books. Amongst many such names is the name of Mangal Pandey.

This is a film where fiction meets real story set in 1857 AD when 'Company Raj' dictated the fate of people in Indian subcontinent. In such times, a brave sepoy Mangal Pandey in british army decides to go against those who invaded the land first and then slowly everything upto the souls of individuals. This is when the first ever mutiny arises and a new page is added in the history of freedom struggle for both Indians & British.

Aamir Khan plays Mangal Pandey passionately with a complete conviction. His eyes, his skills, his overall persona go further to complement his onus as the most brilliant actor we've around. Toby Stephens excels as William Gordon who traverses the most difficult path where he finds himself constantly in tatters amid things like duty, friendship, loyalty and love, but he finds comfort in the company of Mangal Pandey who is a friend for life. Mangal and Gordon's love interests are pleasantly etched by Rani Mukherjee(Heera) and Ameesha Patel(Jwala), inspite of being there only for 'attracting-audience/commerical-success' method. But such cinematic liberties are excusable if it helps to boost the film in anyway.

The film's attention to detail is immense and emerges visually very strong. A.R.Rahman's music doesn't seem to be his best or probably the oddity of songs' situation fails to create that musical impact, but 'Mangal Mangal' song is a spot-on to the theme and the central character. All the scenes between Aamir and Toby are a delight to watch. Toby doesn't fail to impress with his acting or his hindi-speaking lines. Aamir's performance rises with every frame uptil he reaches the peak in the final courtroom scene where he surpasses all the perimeters of just being the finest actor around, but puts him clearly in a class of his own.

After Lagaan(very strong film) & Mangal Pandey, the Indian filmmakers should think of a more substantial subject to hold the global audience instead of only trying to capitalise on India before independence. This is not to take away anything from the independence movement, but we've come a long way from that phase and its time to show that, without having to cater only to very `Bollywood' (song&dance, colorful & heavily designed clothing, overflowing emotions, huge sets) style loving audience. These factors can make or mar a film depending on how naturally they get absorbed in a film script.

While watching this film I deterred myself from any hype or expectations surrounding it, but still this ballad falls short of rhythmic compositions in totality.  This rising only raises upto a likeable and only-for-Aamir film mark, when it could and should've been much more.",1141689600,3,3396,5.01063829787234

8111560,5,B000EN8E4M,"Wow where has Bollywood been in my life!  I was weaned on Hollywood and the movies coming out of there are mostly terrible.  This is the second Bollywood movie I have seen and all I can say is excellent.  My only complaint are the songs and dances in the films but that is a minor complaint and does not take away from the romance and sheer drama.  I was so immersed in the story that I lost track of time and it seemed the movie ended too quickly.  I wanted more!!!  I am falling in love with foreign movies- strong story, character development, action, beautiful costumes and scenery.  Hollywood better wake up or lose more die hard movie lovers like me.",1295568000,3,656,4.371900826446281
8111561,4,B000EN8E4M,"The saga of the 1857 Indian uprising against the British East India Company--called the Sepoy Mutiny by the British and the First War of Independence by Indians--is extremely complex. The tangled history leading up to it, the numerous groups and prominent figures involved, and the myriad reasons behind the revolt aren't conducive to the telling of a condensed narrative. But this film succeeds at doing exactly that by tightly focusing on the issue that finally lit the tinderbox--the deployment of new rifle cartridges greased with cow and pig fat that outraged Hindu and Muslim soldiers in the British army--and the man at the center of it all--a sepoy named Mangal Pandey, who fired the first shot of the rebellion.

Acting great Aamir Khan gives one of his best performances as Pandey, a high-caste Hindu who goes through a painful process of realizing how the British have manipulated him and Indians like him, culminating in his redemptive solidarity with Indians of all castes and religions. His self-discovery comes about through his friendship with a British soldier, William Gordon (played by British actor Toby Stephens), and their conflicted relationship is the crux of the story. Stephens is reason alone to give the film a ringing endorsement. Western actors in Bollywood films are usually dreadful, and it's a pleasure to watch one who does an excellent job for once. Stephens is an accomplished film, television, and stage actor, best known for playing the villain in the James Bond film Die Another Day (2002), and his ability to deliver in Hindi is impressive. The other British actors aren't bad either, although their characters are rather two-dimensional and stereotypical (haughty men, permissive women).

The matter of language is handled deftly in the film, which can't be said of all Hindi movies with Western characters. The British officers logically speak Hindi to Indian soldiers and English to each other. To get around the need for excessive subtitling for Hindi audiences, voice-over narration (by actor Om Puri) is smoothly employed to explain what the English speakers are saying.

Despite its strengths, the film lacks emotional punch. The musical numbers are decent, but they fail to elicit much feeling, which is precisely the purpose they're supposed to serve in Hindi cinema. Romantic subplots are tossed in like an afterthought to please the audience (an all-too-common flaw in Western film). The respective love interests of Pandey and Gordon--an indignant courtesan (Rani Mukerji) and a young widow saved from her husband's funeral pyre (Amisha Patel)--add nothing to the main story, but they're sidelined enough they don't detract from it either--and what an otherwise well-told story it is.

8111562,2,B000EN8E4M,"Aamir Khan's Mangal Pandey is an interesting film version of the 1857 rising in India.  However, this DVD is advertised as having two discs, the movie and a disc of extras on the movie and The Rising.  I ordered the movie twice from Amazon and twice received copies with only one disc in DVD cases that held only one disc, event though the price ($29.99) was for two.  The problem may be with the supplier, but the problem was never resolved.  So check your order carefully.",1200614400,5,474,4.476744186046512
