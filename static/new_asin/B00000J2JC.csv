1231718,5,B00000J2JC,"If you are looking for big budget Winnie the Pooh entertainment, you have two choices. First there are the original classics, available seperately on VHS, or together in both VHS and DVD under the title: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Second choice is their more recent theatrical feature, The Tigger Movie. Both are WONDERFUL films! Anything else you get however, at the time of this review that is, is going to be much lower quality, made for TV stuff.
  What we have here is not truthfully a NEW feature. There's been a lot of false advertising by the direct to video market about NEW Disney features. This, as was the case with Hercules:Zero to Hero, and some others, is really just a compilation of TV series episodes, linked together with some badly done new footage.
  So how can I give this video 5 stars you ask? Well, the second story is reason enough! But I'm getting ahead of myself. This video links 3 stories. The first is an average episode of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh TV series, originally entitled ""Groundpiglet's Day,"" in which the Hundred Acre Wood family gets rather confused, thinking that Winter is over when in fact, it's just about to start. This, like most episodes of the TV series, is a charming little story, though nothing spectacular. The second story is what makes this film so wonderful. This is not actually an episode of the TV series, but a Holiday Special originally called, A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving. It's a wonderful story with great songs and higher quality animation than you'll see in the rest of the video. As I said before, this story is enough to earn the video 5 stars. After that one, we see the Pooh characters preparing for Christmas. This part is a little hard to watch, because the voices sound nothing like those in the other segments, but there is little continuity throughout this video anyway, considering it has so many different sources. Here we find Rabbit telling the story of how he came to raise a baby bird named Kessie. The original name for the episode this leads into is ""Find Her, Keep Her,"" a very popular and touching episode of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. So popular in fact, that Kessie had a sequel episode, and ended up a regular character in the more recent series, The Book of Pooh.
  The final comment: If you like the TV show, or if you liked the Thanksgiving special, get this video, it's great if you know what to expect!",1023840000,45,2436,4.6013824884792625

Combining too many different styles of animation, and having to witness the  ""new"" animation that looked amateur at best really sank this for  me.

I was slightly surprised when my daughter got excited when she saw it. She want to know if we're planning on watching it when she comes home for Christmas.

1231750,5,B00000J2JC,This DVD is child friendly for all ages. The whimsy of Pooh Bear & his friends is delightful to watch. I grew up with Winnie the Pooh as did my children and now my grandchildren. A DVD to be watched all year round and not just at the holidays. A DVD about friendship and doing the right thing.,1366243200,,293,4.068965517241379
1231751,1,B00000J2JC,"I tried to find the episode, ""Find Her, Keep Her,"" on Youtube, but nothing. When I heard of this DVD, I thought, ""That explains why no one wants to put the episode up on Youtube. Copyright."" So I got it for about 50 cents (the rest was from my gift card).

But boy, this is bad. BAD! BAD! BAD!

First off, there is no classic opening from the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Instead we got a creepy CGI version of Christopher Robin's room with all the characters. The singing is terrible. I don't know who was in charge of the singing, but man, those kids in the songs couldn't sing. AT ALL.

And the movie goes as the following:

1) creepy CGI opening,

2) terrible singing about changes of the seasons,

3) ""Groundhog Piglet"" (a great episode, but was unfortunately edited in the ending. [For those who remember how it ended, Tigger shouted, ""November 13th? Do you realize what this means? It's Porcupine day!"" Remember that? Well, poor Jim Cummings was forced to shout, ""November 13th? Do you realize what this means? Why it's almost Thanksgiving Day!"" Really?])

4) more terrible singing,

5) A really dumb story about the gang getting ready for Thanksgiving (by the way, am I the only one that thinks it's creepy that the gang wants to get a turkey when Owl is joining them for the feast? o. O). I have to admit the ending was good in that Thanksgiving is about being thankful for what you have, but still the whole story itself was pretty bad.

6) more, MORE terrible singing about Christmas,

7) A short plot about the gang getting ready for Christmas with Rabbit telling Roo about Kessie, (by the way, Kanga, Eeyore, and Piglet have different actors for this short story, even though, the original actors had done the Thanksgiving one. But these new actors were awful. Kanga sounded like a some big mama cooking eggs and bacon (She seriously sounds like that). Piglet's voice actor didn't even get close to the original and Eeyore, well, you get the idea.)

8) Finally, the episode ""Find Her, Keep Her"" (again edited in the end, back to the gang by the fireplace listening to Rabbit)

9) And then seeing the gang getting the Christmas tree ready for Christmas. Oh yeah, and Kessie comes in at the last minute, hugging Rabbit saying, ""Merry Christmas!""

So the best part of this whole movie was mainly the two episodes. But for everything else, I can't stand it. Even my sister, who is 10, just watches the episodes and skips the rest of the garbage. She even said that the Kessie episode is one of the best, yet put in the worst movie Disney could combined with.

*Advice? If you want to find a good DVD with the episodes without any distractions, get the ""Frankenpooh and Spookable Pooh"" on DVD. It's much better than this one.

Also, if Disney can read this, WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A STORY IN BETWEEN. They did it with Pooh's Heffalump Halloween and A Merry Pooh Year. We just want the episodes, that's it.  We're not asking much. Ruining our experience with these short stories along with our favorite episodes is not a bright idea. Kids can watch just the episodes and love it without any distractions.

Hope that this can clear some light on how bad this DVD was for you and your family.",1361232000,6,3202,4.53125

1231763,4,B00000J2JC,"Since 1926, ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" has been a staple in American pop culture as a family friendly character and stories that many children for generations have grown up with.  And adults who have continued to share that with their own children.

With the holiday season coming up soon, the 10th Anniversary Edition of the third direct-to-video Winnie the Pooh animated feature ""Seasons of Giving"" from 1999 is re-released on DVD (note: the original DVD was released back in 2003) and comes with a mini Christmas stocking.

This feature revolves around Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit and friends celebrating Thanksgiving, Christmas and the winter season!

""Seasons of Giving"" is broken down into several arcs.  The first arc is ""Groundpiglet Day"" (from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"") as Rabbit and the group think the day is February 2nd, Groundhog Day (when actually, the calendar hasn't been changed) and thus they feel as they missed out on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  So, in order to find out if there will be a cold front, they look at Piglet to be a groundhog and determine if Spring is coming soon.

The second arc features Winnie the Pooh inviting Christopher Robbin to join the group at Hundred Acre Wood and hoping for a fantastic Thanksgiving.  This segment is from an actual special.

The third arc features the group celebrating Christmas and Rabbit receiving a Christmas card from Kessie, a blue bird that rabbit rescued years ago.  With Roo wondering who is Kessie is, Rabbit tells his story of how he met Tessie (replaying the cartoon ""Find her, Keep Her"" from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"").

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Video is featured in Widescreen (1:33:1) and for the most part, animation differs at times as some animation is from the TV series, another from a special.  For the most part, the animation is from 1999 and the transfer shows its age a little and there are some dust and scratches on ""groundpiglet day"" while ""A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving"" features a more cleaner animation.  And for the Christmas episode, the animation seems much more cleaner and vibrant but when Rabbit reminiscences of Tessie, then it goes back to older animation.  You can tell which is the older animation as Rabbit is greyish, while in the newer animation he is yellow.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital Surround Sound and is featured in English, French and Spanish language tracks.  Audio is dialogue and music driven and for the most part is clear and understandable.  For home theater owners, I felt that the best setting was to have audio set at stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Winnie the Pooh - Seasons of Giving: 10th Anniversary Edition"" comes with a small Christmas stocking included in the slipcase.  As for special features, the following is included:

JUDGMENT CALL:

  * The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Earmuffs - (11:09) Piglet doesn't take part in the winter games because he feels he can't skate.  But when Christopher Robbin gives him his ear muffs, Piglet thinks he can now ice skate.
  * The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - The Wishing Bear - (22:42) Christopher Robbin teaches Winnie the Pooh how to wish upon a star.  When he does...he believes his wish to get honey comes true. Now, he wants to teach the others how to wish but unfortunately, it seems Pooh has forgotten what Christopher had taught him.
  * Decorate Your Own Christmas Tree - Using your remote, you can  decorate different Christmas trees
  * Coloring with Piglet - Using your remote, you can play a game of memorization and try to color up to three pictures with the correct color.

Just in time for the holidays, ""Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving"" is released on DVD.  I have pretty much grown up with ""Winnie the Pooh"" and the Christmas shows have always been a yearly ritual of watching and to say the least, my VHS tape is no longer watchable and with a six-year-old, I have been waiting for a DVD release of this title.

If there was one thing that may be difficult for some people is the different styles of animation between the segments from the animated television series ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and the special.  As you go from not so good picture quality, to very good picture quality, to even better picture quality and back to not so good picture quality. In other words, newer animation versus older animation, you get a mix of both.

So, for those who are looking for the quality of an animation such as ""Pooh's Heffalump Halloween"" (released in 2005, re-released this month) which has cleaner animation, your not going to get that consistency as the TV episodes from 1999 are mixed with the special.

With that being said, despite the animation inconsistency, the only one who will probably be bothered are mostly the adults.  Frankly, children are probably not going to balk at it and for the most part, this is a family feature that will entertain the kids during the holiday season.

Overall, my six-year-old son enjoyed watching this feature and I can imagine that it's lighthearted, fun and heartwarming stories will also entertain other children as well.  Also, you get two more cartoons as from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" included on this DVD, two interactive games plus a mini-Christmas stocking.  So, overall...this is a solid release.

For its low price and for its holiday entertainment factor, ""Winnie the Pooh - Seasons of Giving: 10th Anniversary Edition"" is definitely recommended!",1254355200,5,5546,4.839702760084926

1231769,3,B00000J2JC,"It's a little misleading to call this a ""movie"".  It's  actually one (or two?) features, one stuffed into the other. Newer footage leads into a ""remember when...."" segment, which is an older feature (different animation style - perhaps  some different voices, or at least different recording quality).

Still, it's a sweet enough story and children probably won't mind the ""old tv special stuffed into a new movie"" package.

The problem I had with this movie is the voice of the little bird.  ::shudder:: An adult trying to talk like a baby I guess... Lots of squeaky whining and mispronunciation of words as only an adult poorly imitating a toddler can do.  Mind you, I like most of the sweet character voice acting of the Pooh movies.  But this reminded me of someone talking baby-talk to their poodle.  It was just irritating.

If watch movies over and over with your child(ren) the voice of the bird may well drive you batty.

If you're children have never seen a Pooh movie, skip this and try ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" or ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"".  Two family favorites in this house!",1191974400,3,1104,4.752631578947368

The difference with Winnie The Pooh - Seasons of Giving and the other collections is the stories go together, when one ends it leads into the next making it flow smoother. There are five new songs brought to this video that are delightful to hear year round.

The movie begins with Tigger, Piglet and Pooh on a windy day trying to figure out if it is winter yet. They head to Rabbit's house since he has a calendar, but they are all unaware that pages flew off the calendar making it seem like Groundhog's Day. The gang wants to make sure there is no more winter so they go in search of a Groundhog. Gopher is not up for this task so Piglet is recruited, but cannot see a thing because his hat is over his head. No one else knows that and assumes since he cannot see he means no shadow, so winter is over.

Everyone now goes to their home for their spring-cleaning and wake up to mounds of snow. Rabbit is upset and storms over to Piglet's house to protest on his Groundhog duties. Piglet is sad when Rabbit leaves so off he goes to find a real Groundhog. A lot of silliness happens with Rabbit thinking Piglet melted in the snow and Rabbit finds the missing calendar pages alerting his friends that it is only November.

Here is the opening line for the next story when Tigger announces he must get his hot chocolatey ice cream ready for Thanksgiving. Now it is Thanksgiving day with all the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood bringing their favorites to a table set up for their Thanksgiving dinner. When Rabbit arrives it all changes when he informs them Thanksgiving is all about Tradition.

They are all glad to have learned this and ask Rabbit what they can do. It just so happens Rabbit came with a list of chores for each to do in preparation of their Thanksgiving Feast.

You have to wonder why Rabbit would send Pooh and Piglet to get a turkey and not do it himself, but he is in charge of decorations leaving Owl for china and Gopher for pie. Eeyore and Tigger are paired up to hunt berries but get stuck in a trap Pooh and Piglet make to catch a turkey.

When they all get back to the table around noon disaster strikes and everything is ruined so the dinner is called off. While sitting at home eating his honey Pooh decides he should share what little he has and heads over to Piglet's House. They all gather again with their favorites they made earlier to the table in the Hundred Acre Wood. They all go to Rabbit's house asking him to come to the Thanksgiving Feast and they enjoy themselves.

Next a note arrives from Kessie so Roo asks who that is which leads into the repeated story of how they rescued the bird one winter. Rabbit took care of Kessie, read to her and taught her about gardening. Rabbit was not happy when Owl started teaching Kessie to fly so she could go south for the winter. It is apparent that Rabbit has fond feelings for Kessie and does not want to see her get hurt. The rest of his friends are eager to assist in learning to fly, which makes Rabbit upset.

After Kessie leaves Piglet is asking Pooh why Rabbit did not like Kessie, so Pooh explains to Piglet that sometimes people care too much, I think it is called Love. Then Piglet is surprised to hear this and wants to see if Rabbit knows about this, but they show Rabbit alone on the hill saddened by Kessie's departure. Pooh tells Piglet that Rabbit already knows and this is the end of the story to Rue on how Rabbit saved Kessie.

This leads into the story of decorating the Christmas tree. Christopher Robbin is in the story as well and they all work together until Rabbit realizes they forgot a star for the top of the tree. They look into the sky thinking they see a falling star but it turns out to be Kessie wishing Rabbit a Merry Christmas. Piglet states that Rabbit did get his wish after all.

My almost five-year old watches this video over and over again no matter what the time of year is. He likes to dance around when the songs are playing and I know most of the words to the songs by heart. This video will show how the friends make their holidays brighter by sharing stories and favorites for their meal.

They learn to overcome their defeats and continue with new traditions while enjoying the season. This is a video that is great to watch any time of the year but especially when fall starts and you might be waiting for winter to arrive.",1128729600,4,4585,4.355971896955504
1231772,1,B00000J2JC,"Anyone with a two-year-old will have to watch the same movie over and over and over again.  This is NOT the movie you want to watch.  Better options include both The Tigger Movie and Piglet's Big Movie.

First of all, the animation is very bad.  Remember the Pooh cartoons that used to be on ABC on Saturday mornings?  That's what this is like.  Choppy animation and sharp coloring.  Not the soothing watercolored sketches that are in The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

THEN - they've completely massacred the characters.  If you like the sensitive nature of Piglet, the generosity of Pooh, the impulsivity of Tigger, and the uptight Rabbit, you will hate this movie.

The movie follows no distinct plot line.  It begins with a misunderstanding of the season (is it November or February?) that can be blamed on individual sheets of Rabbit's day-by-day calendar (now, where would a rabbit get one of these???) blowing away in the wind.

Next, there are about twenty or thirty minutes dealing with the way they figure out that it's nearly Thanksgiving (that's odd - I didn't realize that the English celebrated American Thanksgiving) and the accompanying preparations.  Naturally all of Rabbit's friends bungle the Thanksgiving, but make it all right later.

As if this movie wasn't bad enough to start, we morph from the first story line into an absolutely dreadful segment (which takes up the rest of the movie) about a horrid little kestral named, appropriately, Kessie.  Kessie is a very whiny little bird who is somehow orphaned and abandoned in the Hundred Acre Wood in DECEMBER.

The rest of the movie focuses on Rabbit's foster parenting ability, and his struggle to let Kessie go, as the seasons change and she prepares to fly south.

As a previous reviewer said, it's extremely obvious that this movie was patched together to get it ready in time for Christmas.",1092096000,10,1875,4.882911392405063
1231773,5,B00000J2JC,This is a sweet and touching Pooh film. I strongly suggest watching it if you haven't. I am proud to have it in my collection. I first rented this video from my local video store. Once I watched it I just HAD to have it. It is that good. I knew that it would be a Pooh video that I would watch over and over.,1060387200,3,308,3.753846153846154

7911888,5,B00000J2JC,"Seasons of Giving is another favorite multi-holiday classic of mine; I never did have it in my collection until 2007 with the 2003 DVD release, and again in 2009 for its 10th anniversary edition, with a bonus little stocking! The 2009 DVD surprisingly has no commercials, but has a bunch of bonuses, including the classic 2D Pooh episodes Magic Earmuffs and The Wishing Bear! As A Very Merry Pooh Year contains Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too, Seasons of Giving contains A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving, only 1 year after it debuted on ABC, but with revised narration to match the rest of the movie's narration! The song ""Seasons of Giving"" is broken up into 3 different verses throughout this movie, as with ""Jingly Bells"" in A Very Merry Pooh Year, and ""Christmas Comes Tomorrow"" in the Super Sleuth Christmas Movie! Seasons of Giving also has the 2D episodes GroundPiglet Day and Find Her Keep Her, inside it, along with about 6 minutes of exclusive footage, including Kessie's Christmas visit to the Wood. This movie must've been how Kessie became a regular character on The Book of Pooh; that's only fitting, since Rabbit raised her from a baby Bluebird, and her picture being on the front cover of this movie, AND on the bonus stocking! Sadly, this movie's now in the Disney Vault, so it'll be high to get it nowadays, unless you look hard enough on eBay for a new and cheap copy, like I did for my sister's Pooh Valentine 2010 DVD. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas, everybody!",1479081600,2,1486,4.719230769230769
