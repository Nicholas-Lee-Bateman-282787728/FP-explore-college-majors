1203333,4,B00000F37S,"Having been to several Ross concerts at Caesar's Palace, this captured exactly what we saw.  After the Supremes closed as an act with a final performance at the (now defunct) Frontier Hotel, Diana immediately put forth on a Broadway style (The ""I'm coming out tour"") show over at the Palace. She is known for the over the top Mackie gowns and frequent costume changes  (she originally wanted to be a costume designer and has always been very involved with her stage wardrobe).  After leaving the Supremes, Ms Ross developed a stage presence that seemed to overcome her natural shyness and begin dialogue with her audiences. In this concert film, she is at her best. She knew it was going to be history and played the night to the hilt; here is the diva in top form.  The only drawback is that the concert was captured using 80's technology and the quality is grainy and blurry.  Ross fans will easily overlook the drawback to have this piece of history, but be warned, on a big screen,  it is somewhat difficult to watch. This was also one of the few times the famous Ross ""big hair"" was tamed. You won't see the trademark ""mane""",1197590400,2,1129,4.564356435643564

1203335,5,B00000F37S,"This concert shows why Miss Ross is a Diva.  Not only does she deliver a great show, she changes her outfit, introduces her band, dancer, mother and has her children sing for us.  My only wish is that she would have sang her songs a little longer.  It seems as if she knew she had 80 minutes to get everything done and goes from one song to another.  I enjoyed every moment of this concert.  She sang my favorite song ""Remember Me""  I have never heard her sing this song live before.  I truly enjoyed this DVD and it is a must for any Diana Ross fan.",1186704000,3,550,4.08411214953271

The DVD is very well designed, since it is old, surely transfered from Video the picture is not too perfect, but it is good enough to enjoy this wonderful singer at her best.

1203339,5,B00000F37S,"I changed this review because of the following-  I had stated that I was happy with it because although it is a cloudy, not clear, version of her 1980 concert in Las Vegas at Caesar's, I was happy just to get a copy of that concert. This dvd is a Korean import and not all that great. Well, well, well... thank god for YouTube because someone took their Laserdisc and made a copy and posted it on there and I copied it and burned it to dvd and boy I'm telling you, it is wonderful to see just how spectacular the concert was in great detail.  So if you get a chance and if it's still there, check it on YouTube because as of this date of Jan. 6, 2014 there are no plans to remaster that concert for a USA release (in HD would be nice)- even though Diana Ross owns the rights to it.",1168300800,2,781,4.0
1203340,5,B00000F37S,"This 1980 concert showcases and encapsulates all that was special about Diana Ross and soundly puts to rest any questions about her spunky, considerable charm, talent and way with an audience. All the glitz and glamour is here on vivid display, but also a touching humility from a performer who obviously lived for the stage. The only slight criticism is that at first she seemed to rush rather breathlessly through her huge catalog of songs(in the time-tested manner and tradition of a Las Vegas-schlock meister, I guess). But I wanted her to slow down a little; I wanted more time to savor her beautiful delivery of the songs in the excellent ""Billie Holiday"" segment, for example. She doesn't even give HERSELF time to acknowledge the standing ovations--especially for her poignant rendition of ""My Man""--before rushing into the next number. Still, by the end, you are amazed at her performance! This video-turned-DVD demonstrates what great performance is all about. Audience connection is crucial--and Ross delivers that to the max!!!",1167609600,17,1039,5.190476190476191
1203341,5,B00000F37S,"I can't begin to tell you how much fun it was to watch this concert.  I first watched it in the early 80s when it was shown on TV, and it was one of the first things the family taped on the VCR, I can't believe how much of this concert I remember.  This is truly Diana in her element, she was at the top of her Motown days as a solo star, she had hits records and it appears this concert was not long after `The Boss' was released.  For people who have never seen Diana live in concert, it's good to see how powerful her vocals actually are.  In the days before DAT backing tapes and cordless mics and Madonna style headsets, Diana was doing her thing.  This is a very slick show, I really like the entrance, haven't seen anything like that, and it's very clever.  There are lots of sequins and costumes changes, and Diana looks like she is enjoying herself.  For a true fan of music it's good to see how concerts are meant to be; not all greased up dancers and lip syncing, Miss Ross really does herself proud.  It's a shame there are no DVD extra's but I feel this is definitely DVD worth it.",1167264000,36,1094,4.127358490566038
1203342,5,B00000F37S,"This concert is from HBO's Standing Room Only Concert Series.

This is a portrait of Miss Ross at her entertaining best. She sings, she dances, she makes 'em laugh and she lets the peons touch her. Its absolutely great. If anyone had any doubts about  whether or not the lady could sing they should check this out. She gives a full throated performance of her greatest hits up until that time. Her Ashford and Simpson written and produced album, ""The Boss"" is well represented here. From the title song to ""I Ain't Been Licked"" to ""All For One"" Diana works the crowd and rocks the house.

The lady looks beautiful. The staging is great. When she walks out of her own face on the screen to ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""  it may take your breath away. She ends this spectacular performance by exiting the venue carried away by muscle men. No wonder Billboard Magazine named her Entertainer of the Century.

My favorite song in this concert is ""God Bless the Child.""

The quality of the DVD is not the best, true. Pay attention to the magic and you'll be glad you have a copy. An essential for real Ross fans.",1138924800,3,1108,4.487562189054726

True, it's a taping from 1979/80. So the video and sound quality is that of the time. But is not something that detracts from the amazing quality of this performance. If yo can still watch a movie from the 80's and accept that when it shows on your tv, you'll be fine enjoying this performance.

Miss Ross' performance is truly legendary and she was waaaaay ahead of her time with the production of this concert, with all of the gigantic projected imagery and lasers.  I was fortunate enough to see it live when it toured and it was simply breath-taking, so no complaints whatsoever there - nuff said.  However you'd think they'd have the decency and respect to do the Hollywood remastering thing, for as others have mentioned, the quality is appalling!  Viva Miss Ross!!

1203480,5,B00000F37S,"""Diana Ross In Concert"" is a 1979 concert from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  The concert moves fast and is wonderful to see and hear.  You do have to forgive the video quality, but the audio is fine, and I enjoyed the performance and singing from Ms. Ross.

You get to see Ms. Ross's mother, brother, and her three very young daughters, as well as Marvin Gaye and many other close friends and guests of hers.  So this is a snapshot in time for Ms. Ross.  Compare it to a somewhat faded and smiling family portrait or a few happy memories.  One of the songs ""Remember Me"" is apropos for this special concert.

Ms. Ross is wonderful, delightful, happy, friendly and just a little naughty.  And she has an incredible smile.",1319500800,,720,4.442748091603053

1203591,2,B00000F37S,Yes it's the concert from 1980 but it was a disappointment.  All of the reviews I am reading here do not address the quality issue.  This DVD was created from old VHS tapes!  I had the original concert in the old Laser Disc format and assumed that at least this DVD was created from a master of high quality. I just purchased this DVD January 2011 and it is a waste of your money.  People save your money please!!  It's was nice to see Diana through the haze of this DVD in that it brought back memories.  But it is not worth the price!  And the disappointment is that I will probably watch this once.  I had memories to fill in gap of watching the concert from the special a quality format the Laser Disc.  The Laser Disc picture would look beautiful on today's flat screens.  A friend of mine who sat down to watch this with me could only get a half glimpse of the show because of the poor VHS quality.

1203593,5,B00000F37S,"This is the top rated HBO special of Diana Ross's triumphant Caeser's Palace concert.

The Queen of Motown soars vocally in this spectacle that opens with an ethereal rendition of Ain't No Mountain High Enough followed by a fabulous recital of Touch Me In The Morning.  Dazzling video effects, a Mae West-esque Bob Mackie gown, and a diva in fine voice are to die for.

Powerful renditions of Home, God Bless The Child and My Man showcase Ross at her best (pity Motown rarely recorded her singing with such gusto on her albums). Home, in particular, serves as a reminder as to why critics heralded Whitney Houston as the next Diana Ross when she burst onto the scene (Whitney made her national television debut performing Home on the Merv Griffen show).

People often forget that Ross set the benchmark in terms of having the most lavish productions in her heyday (yes, she was the Madonna of her time).  This concert not only serves as a testament to Ross's legacy as one of music's greatest performers, but also reminds us that they simply don't make 'em like they used to.  Not many of today's performers can work the stage in the vein of music's greatest veterans (Ross, Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner and Cher).  The flash of special effects, the wow of gorgeous gowns, and the sound of big notes are fine and dandy, but it's the ability to create an intimate connection and the ability to cast a magical spell over the audience that really counts.

Ross's 1979 album, The Boss was a key emphasis of the show as it highlighted her growing independence and artistic control in Motown.  The Boss was to Miss Ross as Control was to Miss Jackson.  Speaking of Janet, you can't but wonder if brother Michael caught this show and came up with his own version of Bad after watching Diana here.

Ross, ever the Goddess, closes the show with her trademark Do You Know Where You're Going To/ Ain't No Mountain High Enough medley elevated atop the arms of her dancers.  Very Diva. Very Diana.  The encore number, All For One (One For All) was later adopted as the title of Ross's historic Central Park concert in 1983.

A must-see for fans, musicologists and diva worshippers.  Enjoy!",1263340800,2,2194,4.677083333333333

1203595,5,B00000F37S,"In 1979 my family and I saw this concert in Vegas in 1979 .The show starts with Diana Ross singing ""Ain't no Mountain High enough "" on film,then  starts  walking down the stairs near the end of the song,then comes out of the screen live. It was amazing. The concert included 5 cuts from her new album ,""The Boss,""and a tribute to The Supremes with a medly of there hits,and later comes out as Billy Holiday doing a medley of songs from her  film,""Lady Sings the Blues.""
My favorite number from the concert was ""Home,"" from ""The Wiz.""There was NO LIP SINGING,A Live Band,and not One Hit song unsung.
This concert was a year before her biggest selling record with Lionel Richie,""Endless Love,""and her biggest selling album that featured,""Upside down,""and ""I'm comming out.""

1203596,5,B00000F37S,"Since her days as a Supreme, Diana Ross is at her best on stage, and she drew a legion of hardcore fans that would attend every concert they could.
Diana also became a sought after headliner for Casino Showrooms, and this show was taped at the Circus Maximus room at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

First I must state that a key reason I continue to enjoy watching this show is beacuse it focuses on my favorite Diana Ross album, The Boss, that was released in 1979. Five (5) of this shows songs come from this album, I Ain't Been Licked, No One Gets The Prize, It's My House, The Boss, and All For One.

The rest of the set list is made up of her classic solo hits like, Touch Me In The Morning, Do You Know Where Your Going To, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, and one nod to the Supreme's era, a short take on Baby Love. In fact this was the only tour of Diana's not to include a medley of Superme's songs.

Ms. Ross rounds the show out with a medley of songs from Lady Sings The Blue's, the always popular, Reach Out and Touch, featuring cameos with the late Marvin Gaye, and Ross' 3 daughters. Two other songs include the introspective, Remember Me, the beautiful Stevie Wonder composition, To Shy To Say, and the signature song from The Wiz, Home.

This show is also from an era when casino's would schedule two (2) headliner shows per night, and required that the shows not exceed 60 minutes. Thats said, the staging and pacing of this show are second to none, and it shows the professional that Diana is.

1203598,4,B00000F37S,"This is the Diana Ross DVD that I have been looking for for years now ! Why is it so hidden away and, seemingly, only produced by an obscure import source ?

Way back in 1979 I remember watching this HBO special on UK TV. We were amazed by Diana Ross's performance and I recorded it on our first-ever VCR with piano-key lever controls and a wired remote ! Unfortunately, over the years the tape was lost of got wiped.

I felt sure that the show, being so good, would have been captured and published onto DVD by HBO - but no, nobody seemed to have it available until just recently when this  import with Spanish language covers and menu dialogue showed up on Amazon US. I ordered it through Amazon Marketplace and it came delivered to the UK in just 7 days.

The show is just as wonderful as we remembered it - with an introduction show which was hi-tech in it's day and still stands up against modern concerts today. The way that Diana stepped out of her own projected image was just mind-boggling !

Any criticism of the picture quality is unfair as most younger viewers will have no way of knowing how poor (compared to modern TV pictures) the visual quality of analogue TVs was thirty years ago ! So the video masters by HBO will only convey that 'soft focus' look. This is NOT Hi Def but what do you expect ?

The sound track, however, HAS been remastered and converted from 2 channel stereo into Dolby 5.1 and DTS digital theatre sound for those of us who can enjoy that in our homes.

This is a MUST BUY for all Diana fans - why haven't there been many more DVD's of Diana Ross concerts over the years ?",1230854400,5,1610,4.276315789473684

I was at this performance in October 1979 at Caesars Palace which was held in the Circus Maximus showroom.  The excitement of the performance does translate well in this HBO Special as the production was 1st rate (Motown machine to thanks for that) and the costumes, dancers and songs from The Boss album are in full, top rated supply and form.  The audience enthusiasm is not ""canned"" or Cut-in but was every bit as electric as I remember it.
