8066421,5,B0009STMCK,"paleoworld ran for 50 episodes from 1993-97 and it was a great way to learn about the past. This is just one episode and sadly few of the shows eps are on dvd and even then they are out of print. I owned a number of these shows on vhs, the format was deleted in 2005, but is some cases , some items never made it to dvd and this is one of them. Before walking with dinosaurs this used cgi and models to create recreations of the past. This one is on flying reptiles. The show was 24 minutes per ep and was the 90's best show on ancient animals out there.",1325030400,,554,3.911504424778761
