8037991,2,B00063QDCK,"As a French teacher, I bought this to supplement some of the descriptions of Versailles in our high school textbook.  It is quite informative, IF you can stay awake during it.  The narration is monotone and I watched as my usually attentive class fell asleep.  It does have moments that elicited some reactions and raised some heads (""nobles would find dark corners and staircases in which to relieve themselves as toilets were scarce"" or ""servants would scratch at the door with a pinky finger rather than knock"").  These little tidbits were things that they remembered and referred back to over the year, but as to the main ideas of the documentary, those were mostly lost amidst the snores.",1308614400,,693,4.8474576271186445
8037992,4,B00063QDCK,"This is a good educational overview of the construction and internal decoration of the palace at Versailles.  I was hoping for more on the grounds, and Le Notre.  I would say this would be very good for High school and Jr High students, as it touches on French history and culture of the 17th century.",1154217600,16,301,4.454545454545454
