If you are a fan of Scandal, you'll probably like the movie.

I gave it only 3 stars for some let downs that I had with it, which I'll explain.

1. They need to improve on their set up. This documentary is not meant for foreigners. There are no subtitles/captions in English; and as you might imagine, most of the conversations, interviews and scenes are in Japanese. I know a bit of Japanese, but not enough to follow or understand what they are talking about. I would like to know what their answers where and their comments during the documentary.

2. Yes, it is a documentary, but there are no full songs played here. They only show pieces of the songs. I would have liked to have at least one full song performed live during the movie. I went to watch them live during this tour, and the show was amazing. I was hoping to have some of those moments recorded by owning this Blu Ray.

3. I think they could have added some more material. As I said, the concerts where very good and the set list was very nice too. You can't see much of this in the documentary.

Anyway, I don't regret buying it. It is a nice and enjoyable movie for true fans!",1461974400,,1201,4.22707423580786
