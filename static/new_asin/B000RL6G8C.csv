2869090,1,B000RL6G8C,"I have no problem with bad language in comedy IF it makes me laugh. But this is probably the most laughless hour of ""comedy"" I've ever seen. Saget clearly has talent and a sense of humor (despite everything I still LIKE the guy)...but just as clearly he had no scripted act prepared, and seemed to feel that he could simply fill an hour by shouting out whatever random obscenities came into his head. Often, they didn't even seem to make sense to  Saget himself. It would be interesting to see what he could do with an actual routine...but this particular ""act"" was pretty much an insult to the audience. You'd be nuts to pay for it.",1188518400,14,633,4.456896551724138
2869091,1,B000RL6G8C,"Disclaimer:  I had never heard any of Saget's prior stand up acts to this one, but I had ""heard it through the grapevine"" that his stand up was dirty and hilarious.

I do not understand why Saget cannot see how horrible this stand up act is.  Granted, I didn't see it through to the end, but that was because the first 5 to 10 minutes were soooo bad.  My wife and I looked at each other and couldn't believe what we were hearing.  Not that it was too dirty...it just wasn't funny.  I mean, to me, he was bombing from the get go.  I agree with one of the earlier reviews that it all seemed forced.

Again, why would someone want to put out a production of a night where they bombed?  Don't get me wrong, I couldn't do any better.  I am glad I didn't buy the DVD.",1188518400,12,761,4.046979865771812
2869092,1,B000RL6G8C,Danny Tanner! Calmly step away from the methlab and (or) stop doing blow with the Olsen twins. Listening to the synaptic train wreck of America's most repressed Comedian loses its novelty about two f-bombs deep.,1188345600,7,211,5.057142857142857
2869093,4,B000RL6G8C,"This special isn't the funniest or the most hilarious thing I've ever heard. Since I haven't seen any of his stand-up prior to this, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I saw the special, and I have to say, I do agree with most reviews, only to say, his jokes were there.  Some of which were very funny, although I wish he didn't apologize so much about it afterwards, and for some reason, I didn't care that he used so much dirty language.  The punchlines were funny, but the set-up, (like other reviews say) were too long which strayed from the funny of the joke.

Anyways, I liked the special and yes, I really rated this 4 stars.  I did, very much, enjoy the 3 songs he performed at the end of his special.  The first song, very dirty but very funny.  The second song, for some reason I've heard it before, but also very funny.  The third song, a little less pop-sounding than I expected, but still funny.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, although I would recommend you keep an open mind when you see this.  It won't appeal to everyone, (obviously), but give it a chance!",1188259200,6,1075,4.35678391959799
2869094,1,B000RL6G8C,"Was really looking forward to this, thinking Saget was a lot funnier once the restraints of network prime time would be off.  Wrong.  This is a middle-aged man trying desperately to sound like a foul-mouthed one-of-the-guys punk and it's even less funny and more awkward than a real foul-mouthed humorless punk.  I enjoy gross humor when it's delivered well, but this is just humorless grossness, purely there for shock value and that tires quickly.  What humor there is (and there are a few nuggets in the poop) is poorly delivered in a blast of stream-of-schizoid-consciousness - jabbing and thrusting with arrogant sexual and scatalogical insults, then pulling back with apologies, then thrusting again over the apologies.  I never watched Full House so it's not that I'm too shocked he's burying that goodie-two-shoes image.  Sad, because he's a quick, witty guy, but not here, not with an hour of prepared material, although it didn't seem very prepared.  I can see why the DVD was released at the same time as the TV concert.  Once the word is out, nobody will pay good money for this freak show.",1188172800,5,1102,4.887096774193548
2869095,5,B000RL6G8C,"I saw this on HBO and thought it was one of the funniest acts I've ever seen.  I've seen a lot of TV specials on HBO and Comedy Central, and this is definitely one of the best.  A protege of Rodney Dangerfield, Bob Saget is a hilariously dirty stand-up that would've made Danny Tanner blush.  His non-stop delivery bounces back and forth between telling filthy jokes and apologizing for them -- which then makes it that much funnier!  (It's almost as if Danny is telling the jokes from his deepest darkest subconscious!)  His apologies are certainly where the title ""That Ain't Right"" comes from.  If you're a fan of dirty humor a la Richard Pryor, Dangerfield, or George Carlin, this will certainly not disappoint.  And if you like that stuff and also, like me, grew up watching Full House (or watched with your kids), this will totally knock your socks off.  Not for the timid of family-sensitive, this is shocking, dirty and hilarious!",1188086400,7,938,4.711656441717792
2869096,4,B000RL6G8C,"I was in the audience when they filmed this, and I saw it when it came out, and both times I nearly cried. Saget's comedy surely doesn't appeal to everyone, but I enjoyed myself thoroughly.

Admittedly, some parts were a bit awkward, and you can tell that he stalled at certain spots, but on the whole it was quite good.

In short, don't be harsh on the Saget, dawg's gotta eat.",1188086400,6,378,4.309859154929577
2869097,1,B000RL6G8C,"I have seen Bob Saget perform stand-up prior to the whole Full House/AFV phenomenon, and he was off-color, but really funny.  To me, in this special, however, it seemed as though he was just trying to shake the image by using every expletive, and anti-""Full House"" reference he could come up with.  I think it was overkill, personally.  Felt a little forced if you ask me.  Not that anyone's asking me, mind you....",1188086400,10,415,4.6438356164383565
2869098,1,B000RL6G8C,"I saw this show on HBO and watched it solely to see if Saget was as unfunny as I thought he'd be.  He not only met my expectations, but he exceeded them.  It's so bad that is is difficult to watch, even though I intended to watch it for its ""train wreck"" value (I could not finish it).  Essentially, the whole sketch is a string of unwarranted and unorganized expletives (more of that than anything else) without any comedy in the mix.  I felt like I was watching a unfunny, foul mouth 14 year old imitating Richard Pryor or Chris Rock.  Horrible.  Charging people for this should be criminal and Saget should be forbidden from the stage.  I did learn one thing -- Saget did write all his content for Funnies Home Videos.",1188086400,5,721,4.37593984962406

All you have here is a hodgepodge of dick and fart jokes that never have any substance beyond ""hey, you should laugh because I told a dick and fart joke"".

Bob, we get it. You wanted to find a way to break out of your ""Full House Dad"" typecast by giving the audience something they weren't used to seeing from you.

Apparently bad words combined with lack of talent and lack of funny equals an unfunny, desperate, and overall horribly depressing performance. Hopefully Danny Tanner saved his Full House money.

2869277,1,B000RL6G8C,"As many people have pointed out, Bob Saget's attempt at stand-up comedy has more to do with an elation for saying naughty words than it does for actually being funny. His jokes are so juvenile and often nonsensical that he seems not only like an amateur comedian but also to posses a fundamental lack of understanding of the concept of humor. For example, how many times during the show does he tell a kid in the audience that if he sees Gollum from the Lord of the Rings, don't have s#x with him because he isn't real? What can one possibly say about a ""joke"" like that? I have no idea.

Saget also comes across as a two-faced, pretentious jerk as he gives the middle finger to basically everything and everyone that made him a star, ex. Full House and America's Funniest Home Videos. Once again, it's like he's trying to convince ""the guys"" how cool he actually is and that he isn't really down with all that square s@#t. Well, nobody forced him to go into show business or to be the star of those shows, how about having a little gratitude? I'm sure many other struggling actors would love to have had a break like that.

We also see him in a video montage before the show, signing autographs and taking pictures with people who are most likely fans of his older work (lots of middle-aged/older women) and just randomly saying dirty things to see if they take notice. What kind of a-hole celebrity mocks his own fans right in front of their faces? Once again, sending a message to the ""cool guys"": ""You see these old bags? So delusional, OMG!"" It is not to say that I am a fan of Full House or AFHV, but still, maybe show some respect to the people who care about your work, no matter what it is.

There's a huge difference between spouting foul words and real humor. Saget knows this, as proven by much of his other work. However, his performance in ""This Ain't Right"" -- unless he dropped the distasteful approach he used during the opening -- is unimaginative, and obviously targeted toward an audience that lacks taste, tact, and an adult sense of humor.

In fact it was so crude and unfunny we thought he was making fun of other stand-up comedians who include similar language in their shows.... but it turned out Saget was trying to be funny on his own accord!

Respecting our differences it must concern that some people find this hilarious - and recommend those to visit a professional. Strong words but too mild to describe the awe I (and I can see others) are in after this experience.

I was somewhere in between: I started watching about halfway through, and for ten minutes or more, never once felt the urge to laugh. I outgrew scatalogical humor decades ago (or thought I had). In short, I was in the zero-to-one-stars camp. Under normal circumstances, I probably would have changed the channel or shut the thing off, but I had nothing better to do and wanted to see how bad it would get. But here's the thing: Saget's wit flies by at about a mile a minute, usually buried in what appears to be stream of (very raunchy) consciousness; the jokes are dropped in so slyly through sleight-of-mouth that they're practically subliminal. Moreover, most of these ""wait -- what did he just say?""-type jokes build on previous ones, which is why it took me about ten minutes to start catching up on them. Once I did, I found quite a few of them pretty funny -- and several of his jabs during the last half of my show had me laughing so hard I ended up wheezing.

All of this means it's very tough to figure out whether to recommend his routine to anyone. I think much of his profane material will only appeal to the potty-mouth, not-too-cerebral crowd, and turn off those who appreciate fine wit. But at the same time, I wonder whether his cleverest jokes are likely to be missed entirely by the belch-and-gas crowd. Put another way, I suspect the appropriate audience for Saget is very, very, very small: You have to simultaneously love subtle wit and the most profane, carnal, guttermouth, unredeemably bad jokes in the world -- and be happy, mostly, with the latter. That's a pretty small demographic, and I'm frankly not sure I fall within it.

One last note: I would politely disagree with those who suggest Saget is just trying to play against his good-boy image. Based on my read of the man, I would bet otherwise: He's not overcompensating, folks -- just out of the closet.",1189296000,25,2090,4.686648501362398
2869396,1,B000RL6G8C,"I have never been a fan of Bob Saget and I thought Full House was one of the lamest shows ever put on TV. So, why? you may ask, did I watch this special? I have no idea! I had heard about this HBO special and I decided I would give this guy a shot. Well.......It was kind of funny to hear a ""bad word"" come out of ""Mr. Goodie Two Shoes"" mouth right out of the shoot, but it became tiresome within seconds as this bland white bread bore had nothing funny to say and fumbled through an hour set rambling on like a mama's boy geek with Tourette's experimenting with LSD for the first time! Yeah! he's trippin' alright???!!! One of the worst stand-up shows ever! Don't waste your money or your time! This show is about as much fun as putting rubbing alcohol on jock itch! I hope I have made myself clear and this will keep others from serious pain!",1189123200,5,844,4.152439024390244
2869397,2,B000RL6G8C,"After reading a few reviews and comparing notes with what some people here  had to say for Bob Saget's first HBO Special, I'm at a sort of crossroads in regards to how much I'm really willing to carve Saget a new hole. I'm not basing this on pity but instead on the answer to one simple question: ""Did I at least get a chuckle out of this?""

The answer is a yes. It was never a gut busting laugh fest but the idea of Saget Calling Dave Coulier's hair a reverse Sting/Flock of Seagulls piece of crap or prompting audience members to ask Coulier if he shaves his balls was mildly entertaining. Possibly too mildly, maybe even Taco Bell Border Sauce Mild. When asked to describe his comedic style the problem with the term I'd use to describe it is that it sounds to chic or too smart. You be the judge. I say it's the closest to Streaming Consciousness of a perverted and molested thirteen year old boy. It's crude, it's random, segways are non existent and any excuse to say f*&k is used and abused. Now, that's not to say I didn't laugh in various moments. Hell it's not even to say that I didn't enjoy it. I did, just mildly.

It almost seems as if everything Saget has done could be chastised for being mild and it seems as such a BS word, but it does hold water often times. I saw Farce of the penguins and actually enjoyed it a lot because it's coarse, crude and random, but it worked. I saw the Aristocrats and enjoyed his version of the joke though I would have loved to have seen the versions from Richard Pryor, Bill Hicks, Rodney Dangerfield and Sam Kinison much more than Saget's full version, though I can see why it works for Saget. If it's all about stacking disgusting slurs one on top of the other to baffling heights and forgetting the uses of logic, then he's golden.

As for a more grounded defense, I'd like to comment on what some people said as far as this being the worst standup in existence. I'd also like to bring forth a 4 star rating saying that the standup isn't everyone's cup of tea. First off, this is not the worst standup ever. Second off, I agree that this isn't everyone's cup of tea. You have to enjoy the hellish mish mash of random comments to get into Saget or at least this standup. Thirdly, though this is not everyone's cup of tea, it's also NOT a 4 star performance much less a five star performance. It's ok, it's watchable and to be fair with the guy, I'm sure if I see it a couple of times, I'll enjoy it a bit more, but quite frankly, Saget just wanted to kill his Danny Tanner nice guy Bob persona with one solid stab, and that just wasn't to be.

You were a sitcom dad, you were a family show host, you made a boat load of money... this is your due payment. Who knows maybe he did a pound of cocaine before taking the stage hence him being so wired, but seems like he could always be that way. Again, it wasn't a total loss and to compare it to something you can understand, it's almost like one of those crappy movies you have to finish once you start watching.

Danny Tanner might not be gay, but he's not hilarious either. that's what happens when you expect something, and get something totally different and half as cool as what you had in mind. Hell he even avoided the Aristocrat joke which was a cheap pop in the making if I've ever seen one. What I will give him though is that he's produced some interesting movies and I'm far more comfortable giving him money than Menca any day of my life.

As for the whole making fun of shock value ploy, I'm not convinced that's it at all. Bob has been sold as one of the dirtiest comedians right now, and he migh have felt the pressure or something. Again, it has its moments and there are definite pieces worth quoting, but they are few and far in between each other.

In short, though it's not the massive piece of dung some people herald it as, I'm not going to be sucking c*&k to see it again.",1189036800,4,3895,4.246963562753036
2869398,1,B000RL6G8C,If i could have given this zero stars i would have. And for anyone giving it more than one star saying it was funny you know nothing about comedy. Saget obviously going for shock value by cursing every other word totally misses that cursing doesnt make ANY comedian funny. Telling actual jokes makes them funny. He proved that he didn't work the clubs AT ALL and all his material sounded like it was made up on the spot. It was incredibly painful to watch and i felt amlost sorry for him that he really isn't funny at all and sorry for HBO that they paid him for that hour of garbage.,1188950400,6,584,4.27027027027027

2869400,4,B000RL6G8C,"Those who can't see he is actually MAKING FUN of shock comedy missed the whole point.  He laughs at himself, he admits it's crude - hence it's hilarious.  Oy, you people.",1188777600,2,170,4.451612903225806
2869401,1,B000RL6G8C,"I was kind of looking forward to this after his shockingly funny turn in the Aristocrats. My husband and I turned it off after 10 minutes. One of the most unfunny things I've ever seen. We were both amazed it made it on to HBO which usually has much higher standards. He uses the F word so much that it loses any and all shock value. I kept thinking that he was that nerdy kid in highschool who decides to ""become cool"" and practices cursing and posing in front of a mirror. PAINFUL to watch.",1188691200,8,492,4.189473684210526

Saget is still trying to ride the wave from his ""Half Baked"" appearance and needs to sit down and write some actual material.  His friendship with HBO prez Chris Albrecht is the only reason this made it to television.  And now it's on DVD?",1188604800,7,410,4.5479452054794525
8201261,5,B000RL6G8C,"If You're Expecting Danny Tanner then you will be sorely disappointed. Yes, Bob Saget is incredibly crude, vulgar and borderline insane, but that's what makes this stand up so funny. It's basically a stream of consciousness for 55 but that's great. I think a lot of people got bent out of shape because they were expecting him to do jokes like you did on America's Funniest Home Videos, but that's not what you're going to find here. When he picks out audience members for random jokes it's probably the best, but I thought people complaining about that too. Luckily this is included on my HBO Prime subscription so I've seen it multiple times and I still laugh. This is great for anybody who has to constantly keep it G-rated but they're really a strong NC-17. This is not something to ever watch well your kids are awake, but other than that it's funny if you want to laugh and you aren't easily offended. The people who say they aren't a prude and aren't easily offended are typically the biggest prudes you will ever find who walk around in a constant state of offense. This is not highbrow humour and it's not Richard Pryor either. He has his own style which is blurting out random insanities.",1525824000,,1198,4.576744186046511

If you're expecting the character you saw on Full House this isn't for you. This is for someone who likes blue humor, and if you don't know what that is you will probably be offended.",1515974400,,451,4.022222222222222

8201265,2,B000RL6G8C,"I think that Saget uses the F word when he is nervous or ill at ease. The beginning of the show was F__k every other word, in fact so much so that if that word was removed, the first 30 minutes could be condensed to 5 minutes. By the middle of the show it was down to every 5th word and by the end about every 12th word. All that being said, the show was occasionally humorous but mostly not. He could be a funny guy,  however he was not in this.",1499990400,,446,3.847826086956522

This is raunchy, profane and occasionally cringeworthy humor and not for everyone, but I found it to be very funny throughout. I liked how he engaged with the audience for comedic effect. I had no expectations going into this, but I enjoyed it very much and laughed out loud on multiple occasions. If you don't enjoy the first 10-15 minutes, then you won't like the rest of the show.
