If only for Dana Delany and her shoulder pads of wonder, her clutch purses of power and her waist coats of cool!! The outfits rock!! The story is a bit blah, but its Charles Bronson at his mildest. Dana Delany doing the best she can to lift this dullness. Its hackneyed and cliche ridden! And so much is left in the dark story wise. But the acting is ok, and the cast is good. If you like Charles Bronson you might find it a bit soft, and if you like Dana Delany you might find it a bit well cheesy.. for some reason I kinda love it! :P",1321833600,2,608,3.911290322580645
