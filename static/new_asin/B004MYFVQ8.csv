4433873,4,B004MYFVQ8,"This is the 1966 Italian film, ""La Streghe"". It has been incredibly hard to find for many, many years.

 I obtained an unofficial VHS of it years ago, and this is its first official American release of it, any home video format, that I'm aware of.

 It is one of those 60s omnibus films with five short stories from five different directors. As usual, some are better than others. The only connecting thread between the stories is actress Silvana Mangano, who is in all of them. The first one, by Luchino Visconti, is visually sumptuous and elegant, but very slow. The segment by Pier Paolo Pasolini is very funny and entertaining if oe is a fan of Pasolini. In addition to Mangano, it features Toto and Ninetto Davoli, and is similar in style to Pasolini's earlier ""Hawks and Sparrows"". One of the segments, where Mangano receives a very quick ride in a car, is very short and seemed absolutely pointless. The film's final segment is far and away the best, and makes it all worthwhile. The Vittori de Sica segment starring Mangano and Clint Eastwood, fresh off of his Italian 'Dollars' trilogy for Leone, is a portrait of an unhappy housewife and her oblivious, self-absorbed husband. The lavish daydream sequences are dazzling and funny, and even feature a couple of gentle jabs at Eastwood's own cowboy image of the time. Overall it is uneven, but quite entertaining.

 I'm happy to see it finally available.",1297641600,30,1411,4.762295081967213

4433884,5,B004MYFVQ8,"This is a very satisfying DVD release. Audio quality (Italian) is very good, English subtitles are flawless.
As concerns the (much debated) picture quality: I'm very pleased with it. The movie's preface states the material was taken from the best of the available sources, and indeed it is I think. This rare film aired on German television in the Nineties, in really poor picture quality. This DVD version is far superior. Especially the Pasolini sequence comes with an immense visual clarity. Some people's complaints about the picture quality of the movie could stem from the unique lighting style of Visconti whose episode opens the film and therefore gives the viewer the first impression. Visconti experimented with shadows and glimpses of light coming out of the shadows. This visual style is also present in his 1972 film ""Ludwig"". When the latter was shown on German TV some years ago, the TV announcer deemed it necessary to inform the viewer that the dark images of the film about to be shown were not a technical problem of the viewer's TV set but were due to the visual style of the director. Indeed an audience being unfamiliar with Visconti may misunderstand the visual style and draw the conclusion that the film print is just too dark. However if you look closely you can see of course how craftily Visconti's films are photographed.
My favorite episode of ""The witches"" is Pasolini's contribution, a seamless sequel to his masterpiece ""Uccellacci e uccellini"". In my opinion Pasolini's visual style is the most interesting of all the directors assembled here. Not only the montage of the sequences and the framing are breathtakingly timeless. Pasolini went one step further than his colleages. He created a colour movie ""from scratch"", i.e. in a similar way Kurosawa did later with ""Dodesukaden"": Both directors not just made a colour movie, they thought of every colour and created a true painting whilst filming.
A word about Silvana Mangano: Perfect! (That's just my personal taste. Had the producer of the movie insisted on Sophia Loren instead I'm afraid I wouldn't have liked it).",1438905600,,2104,5.014285714285714

4433891,4,B004MYFVQ8,"I stumbled across this bizarre little gem one rainy Saturday afternoon on one of the ""off"" channels on TV. It was already into the middle of the first  story "" A Witch Burned Alive"" when I found it. At first I was unaware this was 5 separate stories and was confused until I got online and read up on what was going on. I especially liked the segment ""The Earth as seen from the Moon."" And the Clint Eastwood episode was quite amusing (love Clint).

I know this was originally in Italian, but the version shown was overdubbed in English without subtitles. I guess I'm more receptive since I love old films that are slightly off-beat. Maybe it would've been better if all 5 stories somehow linked other than having the same actress in all the story lines.

4433898,3,B004MYFVQ8,"Another one of those anthology films bringing together several major directors that were so popular in Italy in the 60s, The Witches aka Le Streghe offers Silvana Mangano in a quintet of tales that have nothing to do with witchcraft directed by Luchino Visconti, Mauro Bolgonini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Franco Rossi and Vittorio De Sica. Two of the episodes are extremely brief comic vignettes written by satirists Age-Scarpelli with Bernadino Zapponi - Bolognini's Civic Duty is really just a fast drive to a punchline with Mangano offering to give an injured Alberto Sordi a lift to a hospital while Rosi's La Siciliana is a five-minute vignette that ends in a bloodbath - with Visconti, Pasolini and De Sica's efforts taking up most of the screen time. As a showcase for its star it can feel a bit hit-and-miss, allowing her plenty of range in the five roles but not giving her good enough material to really excel, but its rarity does make the film seem a little more intriguing than it would be had it been more widely seen: it was shot in 1965 but took another two years to make it to continental screens and was barely seen in the English-speaking world.

Visconti's A Witch Burned Alive isn't entirely successful, but it gradually becomes more interesting as Mangano's movie star and not entirely convincing style icon arrives at friend Annie Giradot's house in the Alps for a party and finds the host's husband Francisco Rabal making a play for her. Not that he's the only one: all the men want to sleep with her while the bitchy female guests take great delight in removing her wig and eyelashes when she passes out to bring her down a peg or two (though she actually looks better without them). Envied by all, it's increasingly clear that she's simply seen by others as something to possess, photograph or attempt to dismiss, a game of blind man's bluff in a darkened room and a phone call to her husband where her good news is just a potential career setback to him setting her on the path to her zombie-like departure amid a flash of paparazzi cameras, her glamour restored but her face a death mask.

Pasolini's urban fairytale, The Earth Seen from the Moon, is an amiably cartoonish oddity with a wild haired Toto's Mr. Miao and his even more outrageously coiffured son Ninetto Davoli making a pact on their wife/mother's graveside to find a replacement they both approve of (no redheads) and, after a whole year of rejections, settling on Mangano's deaf mute, Miss Absurdity (the most likeable of her five star turns). Naturally they don't know when they're well off and a tragedy involving the Coliseum and a banana skin ensues - though that's not the end of the story. But it's De Sica's episode, A Night Like Any Other, that's given the film what little notoriety it retains for its casting of one Clint Eastwood as Mangano's boring husband who doesn't think people get enough sleep. He's so boring, in fact, that when she fails to reawaken any passion in him she retreats into a fantasy world where the entire male population of Rome follows in her wake and she romps with Batman, Flash Gordon, Diabolik and Mandrake the Magician while he can only look on aghast and beg her to think of the children. Ironically, it's Eastwood's involvement that also guaranteed the film's obscurity: United Artists brought it specifically to keep it on the shelf while they were promoting Eastwood's Man with No Name films in case it damaged his image before giving it a very cursory US release in 1969 once the Leone films and Hang `Em High were out of the way and then burying it in their vaults. Written by De Sica's long time collaborator Cesare Zavattini (Umberto D, Bicycle Thieves) it's the best realised of the five, and certainly Mangano's best role in the film even if it is no more than a slight diversion.

While it never really escapes the feel of a vanity production (it was produced by Mangano's then-husband Dino De Laurentiis), and it's a long way from the best of these `portmanteau' films, there's an undeniable curiosity factor to seeing Eastwood camping it up in the fantasy scenes as well as spotting a young Helmut Berger when he was still called Helmut Steinbergher carrying the bags in Visconti's episode. There are some good production values as well, with Ennio Morricone and Piero Piccioni sharing composing duties (Morricone's contribution to the Pasolini episode being particularly catchy) and Giuseppe Rottuno showing his versatility as cinematographer for all five directors' very different styles. Far from essential viewing, but MGM/UA's manufactured on demand DVD-R is a decent but not outstanding widescreen transfer that offers the option to see De Sica's story with English soundtrack that has Eastwood using his own voice or the subtitled Italian version.

4433899,2,B004MYFVQ8,"This proves that director's-cinema is as bad as actor's-theater.

Actor's theater is when you have no director but the actors just ad-lib around the stage. Director's cinema is when the story is incomplete lacking a flow-of-complexity so the director looks for angles-&-emphasis to try to make ""something"" happen.

What made the TV show ""Twilight Zone"" so great was the complete short stories played out in 20 minutes. What makes this poor are the single or double idea stories without a sense of finish and completeness except maybe at the most childish intellectual level.",1331078400,,574,5.161290322580645

4433903,4,B004MYFVQ8,"[THE WITCHES aka LE STREGHE - (1967)]  Silvana Mangano, then wife of famed producer Dino de Laurentis, gets royally showcased here, portraying five different women in five short films, each directed by a noted Italian director. In the first vignette directed by Luchino Visconti, she's a beleaguered movie star attempting to hide away from her fans and the press in a large ski chalet of an acquaintance (who's in the throes of a party, unbeknownst to her) and is promptly pursued by the men on arrival, and despised, ridiculed and deconstructed by the women guests behind her back. These are the witches of the title, no doubt. It's an interesting and entertaining observation on the pompous and well-to-do, without making too much of a statement.

The second tale, 'Civic Duty', probably the most symbolic of the five, sees Mangano as another well-dressed witch whose vehicle is stopped at the site of a car accident with injuries. In order to avoid the congestion, she uses an injured man as an excuse to barrel through Rome traffic at Nascar speeds under the guise of being hospital bound, while the racing beauty is really just using the poor hapless victim as a shill to get to a rendezvous on time. The man mutters unintelligibly while he ponders why she's doing this. Insanely selfish, incredibly inconsiderate, though nonetheless comedic, Silvana looks fabulous as she rushes to meet her playboy date, leaving her injured, mumbling passenger wandering incoherently while dodging speeding cars in rush hour traffic.

In the third, cartoonish short directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, 'Earth as Seen From the Moon', our dear Silvana is a green-haired deaf-mute who becomes the second wife of a lonely widower (exceptionally played by comic Toto) who has been searching the countryside for a bride (and a step-mother for his orange-haired, pimply-faced son). Their financial duress incites a scheme to get wealthy, haphazardly misfiring and causing the apparent death of Silvana's character, but when father and son return home from her funeral in hysterics, she's there awaiting them, no worse from the event. Could this be witchcraft? This is by far the most bizarre of the five stories and is told with vibrant psychedelic imagery, whimsy, warmth and surrealism. This will make it hard for some folks to take, but has great value as an exercise in oddity and allegory. It's a fractured fairy tale as delivered by a master.

 In 'The Sicilian', a Spaghetti Western saga of ridiculed religion and revenge, Mangano comes home and tells her father of a man who expressed great interest in her, but ultimately shunned and disgraced her, at least in her eyes. Her father demands the name of this individual, as her shame is also his shame; she resists initially yet divulges the name anyway (as we knew she would, this being the overwrought Sicilian woman being parodied here). Soon enough, carnage erupts as men are shotgunned down in dozens - fathers, brothers, sons, uncles, cousins, etc. - all expire like a temporary library card in a Sergio Leone movie. Silvana enters the funeral setting where the bodies are laid out and begins the distraught, melodramatic hysterics the likes of which you'll only see at a Sicilian funeral (or wedding, for that matter - don't ask).

The final tale, 'A Night Like Any Other', directed by Vittorio de Sica, Silvana plays a bored, underappreciated housewife married to Clint Eastwood, who complains to him about the mundane existence they share after ten years of marriage, all the while fantasizing about what life was once like and could again be with a little imagination. These flashbacks are hysterical. This segment probably holds the most interest of the five because of the presence of a young Eastwood (even his nameless gunslinger image is parodied) and the multitude of striking costume and hairstyle changes that Mangano undergoes throughout. One fantasy sequence has her being courted by a multitude of comic book characters like Flash Gordon and Batman, though her sexy, way-out costume shames theirs by a longshot. Why Albert Broccoli never made this actress a Bond villainess is beyond me.

This concoction of stories will not appeal to everyone, but most viewers will at least get a slight kick out of at least one or two segments. If you're a fan of 60's Italian or European anthology films like 'Boccaccio '70', 'Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow', 'The Maniacs' or even 'Spirits of the Dead', you should find this one engaging enough - don't get me wrong, Silvana Mangano is no Sophia Loren by any means, but who is? Approach with the proper mindset and immerse yourself in the cauldron of 'Le Streghe' and you might find yourself spellbound. I did.",1312329600,16,4705,4.9936224489795915

8436309,2,B004MYFVQ8,"I love foreign filmsfor the most part. They give a viewer an insight into other countries and film styles from around the world. That exposure reveals how various directors in the U.S. have altered their styles from the things theyve learned abroad. At the same time it can show how foreign directors have been influenced by American directors. But not always.

In some cases there are directors who march to their own drum, creating their own unique and singular style. Those directors are most often hailed as creative geniuses whose artistic expression exceeds the limits place on them by the art form they have chosen. Id love to be included among those who feel this way but unfortunately Im not. I see film as a combination of art and commodity, an entertainment for all. Art for the benefit of one doesnt impress me. But thats just my opinion.

Id never heard of THE WITCHES before it was being released to blu-ray by Arrow. I was familiar with its producer, Dino De Laurentiis. Id heard of several of the directors involved including Vittorio de Sica, Luchino Visconti and Pier Paolo Pasolini. But Id never had access to seeing features directed by them which has always bothered me. Watching what theyve delivered here hasn't stopped me from wanting to see their works but I wouldnt base my interests on this offering.

The film is composed of 5 segments, one for each director and all starring Silvana Mangano. Mangano was the wife of producer De Laurentiis at the time and while she was recognized as a star one has to assume he produced this film in the hopes of furthering her career. Other than the fact she is featured in all 5 there is no connecting theme here that I could make out.

In the first segment shes featured as a reclusive movie star/model whos run off to her friends ski villa. There shes met with awe by her friends social circle, the women who choose to pick at her frailties and the men who all want to bed her for the night. She moans, she feints, she over dramatizes her life and then moves on. The piece comes off as a reflection on fame and the down side of it, never offering a standard story with beginning, middle and end. Well shot and acted the worst part of this is the fact as the lengthiest story here it goes nowhere and tells us nothing.

Our next offering has Mangano as a woman driving her car and being held up by an accident on the road. She volunteers to take the injured man to the hospital and the majority of this segment is little more than her driving recklessly to the point of potentially doing more damage to the man than he already received. The end can be seen coming miles in advance and therefore loses any surprise or humor that one would expect. This piece felt like a comedic effort that just goes a little too long. It is also the best piece offered.

Third up is the weirdest of the bunch. Told in excruciatingly surrealistic style it tells the story of a man whose wife has died leaving him with their grown son and no one to look after them. He meets a woman who is mute, runs off and marries her and then brings her home to a shack they live in. Longing for a better home he convinces her to fake a suicide threat in hopes people will give them money to prevent it from happening. The end result isn't what anyone expected. From the extreme colors chosen for peoples hair, clothing and homes this looks like an episode of Pee Wees Playhouse. The acting is also over the top, a combination of pantomime and spoken word. The end result is one of those what have I just watched style films.

Fourth is another somewhat entertaining piece that has a woman manipulating her father. First she refuses to tell him what her problem is only to then tell him a man made an inappropriate pass at her. In return he seeks revenge by killing the man responsible which sets into motion a chain of killings all done in revenge of the previous killing. The piece is short and to the point but offers little.

Lastly is the story of a woman who feels that her marriage has fallen flat, the excitement gone from their lives. He goes to work, comes home and ignores her while shes done all she can to please him. As the segment unfolds she imagines him in various scenarios in the same location, showing her the affection and attention she craves while their reality is far from it. As with all the stories it ends nowhere, nothing advanced or changed. This segment is notable for the casting of Clint Eastwood in the role of the husband. By this time he was a star in Italy having made his first two spaghetti westerns the 2 years before. Watching him here is painful at times, especially when a segment calls for his interpretation of Fred Astaire like moves.

On the whole while the movie was interesting to watch from a historical perspective it lacked anything I would call entertaining. It is a case of style over substance, where the directors were more concerned with showing off how different they were than the mainstream, how artistic they could be and little more. As I said Im a fan of foreign film but not of movies that purport to enlighten me or to show off how artistic they can be at the expense of entertainment. Others may enjoy films of that sort but for me and most they tend to be ones to pass by.

For those fans, the ones who enjoy works like this, Arrow has come through again with a version that will be a must to those fans collections. To start with they're offering a 2k restoration of the film done exclusively for this release. Extras also include a new commentary track by film critic and novelist Tim Lucas, an interview with Ninetto Davoli, an English language version of the segment featuring Eastwood, a reversible sleeve with new artwork by Graham Humphreys and for the first pressing only an illustrated booklet featuring new writing on the film by Pasquale Iannone and Kat Ellinger.

The first segment when I saw it in English long ago, (possible spoiler) had a beautiful woman at a party and she faints.  The other people criticize her because they examine her while she's passed out and see she's not naturally beautiful, but uses a lot of enhancements (one lady notices she's wearing eye slanters) - items that some women wear to hold their skin taut and erase wrinkles (instead of an actual face lift).
