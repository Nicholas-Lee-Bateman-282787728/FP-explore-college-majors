8617094,3,B00FN5PG9W,"The production was excellent.  Great costumes. Does not follow the manga or anime well but that is probably due to the limitations of trying to keep the live action story moving.  Gave it a three star since this is a FAN SUB which I did not realize or I would not have bought.  Subtitles were off and not always correct as well as the sound track.  How do I know it was a fansub?  Last episode there is blurb at the end stating ""FANSUB done by.....""",1493337600,2,449,4.174418604651163
8617095,5,B00FN5PG9W,"Series is so worth it.  Dark, but is tame enough for 13 years to watch and enjoy.",1476057600,,81,3.764705882352941
8617096,5,B00FN5PG9W,"this is very faithful to the first and second season and is in the form of several episodes.  I highly recommend....in many ways better than the animation.  Casting is good,  atmosphere right on",1467417600,,194,4.818181818181818
8617097,5,B00FN5PG9W,"Excellent adaptation within the limits of the medium.  A lot of negative criticism of this production seems to hinge on rather childish expectations that every entertainment have a huge budget and lavish effects.  This production shows you how to do it with less and still tell the story.  The supernatural elements are not the star here, the ensemble is. Himewari and Domuki's characters shine forth particularly well here compared to the manga and anime versions.  Casting and acting are top-notch.  The location scouting, art direction, and costuming also deserve big kudos.  CLAMP's stories are complex and full of action, but at heart are all about the humanity of the characters. This live version of xxxHOLiC goes to show how you can strip them down to that core and get something that is perhaps even more concisely emotionally gratifying than the original.",1463875200,,865,5.099290780141844
8617098,3,B00FN5PG9W,Awesome live action drama! But the subtitles were off and the voices were even off in one of tge episodes.,1449014400,,106,4.35
8617099,5,B00FN5PG9W,"Absolutely amazing and a must have for all CLAMP fans.  The actors were perfect for their roles.  They combined seasons 1 and 2, and condensed it into 8 episodes.  Just the favorites.  But it leaves you hungry for more!",1448755200,2,219,4.538461538461538
