7239577,5,B00YSBFON0,"When I saw the name and advance promos for the show on the CW, I thought the show was going to be stupid. I was wrong. I'm glad I gave this show a chance because I found it pretty entertaining.

This set has all 22 episodes/chapters spread out over five dvds. I don't know why this show and iZombie are not getting bluray releases but I will post an update if I find out Warner Bros' reasoning behind this bonehead move.

Video: All 22 episodes are presented in 16x9 widescreen.

Audio: English only. Does anyone else find it odd that there isn't Spanish audio?

Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, French

Extras: The extras on this set run just over 30 mins...

7239578,5,B00YSBFON0,Jane the Virgin was definitely one of the best new shows last season. I thought it was funny and interesting and reminded me quite a bit of Ugly Betty. I am so glad that this show was renewed and look forward to more adventures with Jane.,1435536000,3,238,4.195652173913044
7239579,5,B00YSBFON0,"When I first heard the premise of this series, I doubted it would hold my interest, and I thought it would be another of those trashy shows that end up being axed before they've completed the first season.  But this show is brilliant.  I just love it.  Filled with humour and some drama and sometimes not taking itself too seriously, it is highly addictive.  It's also narrated in a great way, with lots of humorous on screen text that makes it a little more unique.
Jane gets artificially inseminated when going for a regular pap smear.  She was asleep when the doctor entered her room and answered ""Yes"" to the wrong patient name without realising.  From there, there are breakups and make-ups, murders and mysteries, laughs and tears and a general feel good time.  I love this show so much and cannot recommend it highly enough for those wanting some escapism.  Gina Rodriguez is so good in it, as is her estranged father Rogelio (quite a camp telenovela star).
Do yourself a favour and watch this from start to finish; you won't be disappointed.",1435449600,17,1049,4.663043478260869
7239580,5,B00YSBFON0,Please release this wonderful new series in blu ray format. I really enjoy the telenovela story telling. It's so different and it keeps you guessing what's next with each episode. Jmaginpa,1433376000,7,188,5.096774193548387
7239587,5,B00YSBFON0,Awesome show!,1477008000,,13,6.0
7239588,4,B00YSBFON0,"Show is very cute, lots of plot twists. But did not care for the ending, can't anyone be happy for more than 5 minutes? Also the back and forth thing with Jane and Rafael was getting old:  love/not love, break up/get back together. At one point I was growing tired of Jane, everything was about her all the time and what she wanted.

The BIGGEST flub of the whole season was this:

They had to make cutbacks at the hotel, so one of Jane's friends was going to have to get fired. Well, Jane works full time at a high school and then somehow also writes scripts for a tv show(when does she do this?, nights and weekends?) AND Jane is a waitress. All these jobs and also she is pregnant.

She has a rich boyfriend and a rich Father. She couldn't quit the waitress job at the hotel so one of her friends wouldn't get fired? It made no sense.
The writers of Jane The Virgin apparently needed to have Jane still work at the hotel to keep her involved with all the hotel drama.",1472688000,,970,4.198924731182796
7239589,5,B00YSBFON0,"This is one of those shows that knows exactly what it wants to be right out of the box.  In the first few minutes of the show we're introduced not only to the plot concept and the major players but to the atmosphere, between the lively music and Anthony Mendez's Latin Lover Narrator voice.  And throughout this first season, as ridiculous plot twists (starting with the initial plot conceit of ""accidental artificial insemination"") compound with other ridiculous plot twists, all the outlandishness provided by both the telenovela elements on the show and the characters involved in the actual telenovela in the show's world is grounded perfectly by the three women of the Villanueva family and their respective actresses.

Somehow, this first season manages to spin a ridiculous number of plates and not drop any of them.  Plots move along and get resolved at a quick clip, and by the time we get to the end of the first season you'll have laughed, cried, maybe gasped a few times.  (Mostly you'll have laughed.)  I don't think I've ever watched a show that leaves me smiling like this after every episode, and I'm happy this show exists.",1468972800,2,1140,4.82051282051282
7239590,5,B00YSBFON0,i love this show. Good to see some latino talent on tv.,1468368000,,55,3.6666666666666665

7239592,5,B00YSBFON0,"I love Jane the Virgin! I saw previews for this and knew it was a show I wanted to watch. It has a great sense of humor and very relatable characters. It has a good balance of romance, mystery and drama! If you loved Ugly Betty, then you'll definitely love this! Gina Rodriguez does an amazing job of portraying a girl who had a perfect plan for her life and then gets mistakenly impregnated. I also love the narration, which adds a perfect balance of getting inside the characters heads.",1463702400,,488,4.433333333333334
7239593,5,B00YSBFON0,"I bought this for my daughter because I watch it on TV and I thought she would enjoy bingeing  on it. It is a parody of the Latin telenovelas complete with a sexy narrator, who adds a lot of humor to the story. Yes, it is silly, but that is what  makes it fun!",1462838400,2,260,3.7962962962962963
7239594,5,B00YSBFON0,"WOW!  I have seen this available to stream on a different site, and it just didn't seem that interesting. I decided to watch the first episode when bored one night (I don't watch a lot of TV shows or movies), and I stayed up til like 4 am watching episode after episode!  It was that good!  I had to force myself to go to bed, lol.  That was less than a week ago. I have watched the whole season.  What I love about this show is that there is just the right amount of comedy, drama, love, suspense, to keep it interesting. the people actually communicate with each other and work their problems out.  There is a lot of love in this show and I can relate to a lot of things in it. I have even cried a few times because I could relate so well.  I don't know any other show like that, but then again, I don't watch a lot of TV.  Definitely recommend!  Now I need season 2, I have to find out what happened to the baby!!!",1462752000,,917,3.9945054945054945

7239606,5,B00YSBFON0,"This show is witty, romantic, suspenseful and fantastic!!!  I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I've now seen season 1 twice. And I kind of want to watch it and feel everything again!!!!",1456876800,,189,4.90625
7239607,5,B00YSBFON0,"Jane the Virgin is a must see comedy that the whole family will enjoy. The whole ensemble is truly hilarious and you will laugh, cry, scream and shout... and that's just in the first episode.",1456531200,,191,4.485714285714286

7239611,5,B00YSBFON0,"This show TRULY is my guilty pleasure! I felt like all the other viewers, no way could this be a captivating show. Needless to say, I watched all 22 episodes in a matter of 4 days! I was hooked from the start. I'm currently hunting down season two. I have to be ready when season three airs! To all those people wavering should you or shouldn't you watch it? That's an easy answer... WATCH and enjoy! ;)",1453420800,5,403,4.246753246753247

7239640,5,B00YSBFON0,"I am obsessed with this show! It reminds me of Desperate Housewives with the level of drama that takes place. I watched this season on Netflix in like two days and was upset that it was over!!! I now have a friend of mine hooked  as well. Jane is so sweet and the story is so intoxicating that I honestly can't get enough! I have started watching the second season on television, but when I'm cooking and bored I re-watch this first season!!! Love this!!!!!",1449446400,3,457,4.376470588235295

(I have decided to watch all nominated shows in order to broaden my spectrum of trash TV) Not trash at all. Brilliant!! The characters are amazing. Jane is absolutely adorable and her humor and smile are contagious. It is a lighthearted fun show that brings the same feelings as Gilmore Girls, Party of Five and Ally McBeal. Great show!! Addictive and fun.",1447804800,,469,4.662650602409639
7239642,5,B00YSBFON0,love love love this show.!its totally addicting just like a real telenovela. I'm so team Michael but all my friends are team Raphael. Ugh whatever. I recommend this season and next season too. Great show love it,1447804800,2,211,4.72972972972973

7239645,4,B00YSBFON0,"Though US soap operas like Days of Our Lives and General Hospital have been running for fifty years or longer, they don't hold nearly the same level of attention in the US popular culture consciousness as telenovelas do in countless other countries in the world, perhaps most notably in Latin America. Whereas American pop culture treats soap operas with a heaping load of derision or mockery (even using comparisons to them as a way to demean a film or TV show relies too much on melodrama), other cultures have massive followings for their telenovelas, and it looks like American pop culture is finally ready to stop purely lampooning it and emulating it as well. CWs Jane the Virgin takes the telenovela format mainstream with an absurd premise that features all the usual staples: love, affairs, love affairs, murder, schemes, amnesia, unexpected pregnancy, betrayal, and, of course, amnesia.

Unlike US soap operas, however, it uses these devices with loads of wit and in such a way that skewers their melodramatic nature so that Jane the Virgin is fun to watch from start to finish.

To give credit where its due, the two true stand-outs of the series are its lead, Gina Rodriguez (as Jane) and its narrator, Anthony Mendez, who takes Ron Howards work in Arrested Development and gives it a swarthy Latin flavor while maintaining a lot of the dry, omniscient humor. Even if the narrator might get more laughs, and yes, the part is written in such a way to get plenty, the heaviest lifting is done by Rodriguez who works hard to imbue her character with all the earnest innocence necessary so she never seems petty or childish as she deals with her indecision over exactly how she wants her life to be after learning of her new situation.

That situation being Janes unlikely pregnancy, despite maintaining her virginity in an effort to make her live-in grandmother Alba (Ivonne Coll) proud and have a better chance at a happy future than her own mother Xiomara (Andrea Navedo), who herself got pregnant as a teenager and had to raise Jane with Albas help. Unfortunately, the best laid plans are no match for a hungover doctor (Yara Martinez) who mistakenly uses the sperm of Rafael Solano (Justin Baldoni), her brother and son of hotel magnate Emilio Solano (Carlo Rota), to artificially inseminate Jane instead of Rafaels wife Petra (Yael Grobglas). Had nothing come to be, it wouldnt have been too serious, but sure enough the pregnancy takes and soon Jane finds herself thrust into the complicated world of the Solano family, much to the chagrin of her loyal and virtuous cop boyfriend Michael (Brett Dier).

If that wasn't already kind of twisted, Jane and Rafael develop feelings for one another, people get killed, people are not who they seem, a drug kingpin uses the Solano family hotel as a surgical center to change their identity, and Janes father, a major telenovela star named Rogelio (Jaime Camil), comes back into her life and reignites Janes lifelong hopes to become a writer. Its all the over-the-top kind of plot devices youd expect from a telenovela handled in a lovingly straight but satirical fashion so as to subvert and exploit them.

The strength of the writing and the cast shines through in how Jane the Virgin manages to keep the audience drawn in even when things get ridiculous. Gina Rodriguez is so likable from her very first moments on-screen that it would take a very sharp character shift for the audience to turn on her, and we're never given that reason. Her charms are supplemented by the superb narration as well as the supporting cast, especially Jaime Camil who plays the hilariously self-involved soap actor spectacularly, even as the season takes his character to some pretty humiliating places. The writing balances the characters perfectly without ever betraying the telenovela feel or the show's satirical look at the genre.

Creating an entire series that has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek is not uncommon, but when the subject being lampooned is itself an embellishment of reality (which is what telenovelas areromantic drama taken to an extreme) it becomes hard to find the line between satire and emulation. At times, Jane the Virgin certainly seems like it gets lost in the very thing its sending up, but then it unleashes a couple of telenovela tropes at just the right time and in such rapid succession so as to remind us that its taking the already extreme reality of its source material and making it even more extreme, but with a soft and sensitive touch so as never to seem bitter or vicious.
