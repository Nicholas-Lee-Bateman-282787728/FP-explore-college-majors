8107500,1,B000E971H2,Think twice before you buy this DVD. It shows only the drill team performing at their Barrack area for those regular tourists. Nothing spectacular. Just like they are practicing or what. The video and audio quality are worse than an old video tape. The DVD contains quite a lot of advertisements to sustain the 45 minutes claimed duration. I feel nothing but being ripped off,1309824000,,375,4.7846153846153845
