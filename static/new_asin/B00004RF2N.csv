1342159,4,B00004RF2N,"I have grown to love and sometimes hate Full Moon over the years, because alot of their past efforts have failed. Many of Full Moon's movies usually have no plot, boring, terrible acting, or is just plain stupid. That was the not the case with Shrieker. Shrieker is full on fun suspense and slasher! It builds up to the deadly climax when the Shrieker is going to get some one! It makes you wonder who is it going to get next? Full Moon have ripped off of some movies in the past and Hellraiser was one of them. Somewhere in the opening credits it shows these markings and has someone talking. One of those markings were the puzzle box from Hellraiser. It wasn't shown in the rest of the movie so Full Moon didn't ripp off Hellraiser in the plot. That was the only putdown in this movie, because they ran out of ideas so they used the puzzle box from Hellraiser. I have seen other movies that have ripped off of other peoples ideas. For example Jason Goes To Hell : The Final Friday somewhere in the middle of that movie someone finds a book which turns out to be the Book of the Dead from Sam Raimi's gory cult classic Evil Dead. The Shrieker was an awesome looking creature and killed people in a disgusting way. I loved it! Shrieker is one of the few good Full Moon movies!",1036454400,15,1276,4.2987551867219915

1342163,1,B00004RF2N,"This has to be one of the weakest horror films I have seen since Scream 3.  The box boasts having incredible special effects, what a laugh!  It was like watching a cheesy 80's horror movie, except without as much deep plot and quality acting!  It is truly a sad day when I see a horror film that is even below being able to laugh at it.",976060800,,336,4.0606060606060606

1342198,5,B00004RF2N,"I first saw this movie when it came out and have been looking for it ever since. Since I purchased it, I have watched it about a dozen times.

I be brutally honest, we're not talking an award-winning movie here. But, then, for those of us who love this type of movie, there should be an award for it. It has a very original take on a number of things and I've thoroughly enjoyed the ending.

Unfortunately, if you like your movies full of gore, nudity, and profanity, this one will not live up to that standard.",1382486400,,511,4.257731958762887
1342199,4,B00004RF2N,"Six squatters (3 men and 3 women) take up residence in an old, abandoned hospital, only to find themselves stalked by a hideous demon. SHRIEKER is another goofy, but F-U-N movie from the golden age of FULL MOON productions. The monster isn't bad, although it isn't very frightening either. Thankfully, it's shown very little. The characters are passable, w/ only a slightly high annoyance factor. As FM movies go, this one is more ""serious"" than say, HIDEOUS or HEAD OF THE FAMILY. Still, at only 72 minutes, it flies right by! If you enjoy movies about demons, black magic, or bickering squatters, then SHRIEKER will make your night...",1371254400,,636,4.898148148148148
1342200,4,B00004RF2N,"For a handful of months the B viewings have dropped quite significantly pretty much due to a lack of time. So when a week off of work made itself present there was no other option then to find a good old 90's horror B to enjoy. With the rain pouring down outside we stumbled upon Shrieker which we had been wanting to view for quite sometime. Finding out it was a Full Moon production came as a nice surprise and solidified the decision. Full Moon has provided us with years of low quality enjoyment that only a small following understand. Let's face it, their movies are not for the conventional viewer by any means. You have to go in with the bar set so low or else you'll find no pleasure it the film's B goodness. Luckily our vast experience in the B arts has left us with a tolerance for just about anything, leaving us open to enjoy most films that come our way. With Shrieker you will be exposed to a serious lack of acting and not enough Shrieker action. When you have a two faced mutant creature, you want to see him most of the time and not just in the end.

Shrieker starts out with two hospital workers getting shredded apart by a mysterious creature that was lurking in the depths of the building. Awkwardly we flash forward some years later and meet a crew of college students who have found a solution for student housing. They've come up with the genius decision to live in the abandoned hospital instead of living on campus. Please don't allow all the logical questions to dominate your mind at this point, it's of no value. To enjoy this film you must check your brain at the door. Clark, who is a female, is the newest recruit to live the dream of a homeless student in the abandoned hospital. She's sworn to secrecy before she's allowed in the squatters club, being it's so exclusive. From here we hit quite a slow pace of horrid acting and a huge lack of Shrieker action. Clark winds up wandering down to the basement and discovers another squatter who isn't part of the group she's with. Turns out this weirdo is dwelling in the basement attempting to summon the Shrieker from the underworld, and eventually does so. Once the Shriker makes his appearance the bad actors start dropping like flies. The creature itself is quite entertaining and by far the film's best actor, despite it's only dialog is loud shrieking. In the end Clark finds a way to send the creature back to the underworld, and decides to inhabit a different abandoned building to complete her college education.

In the end Shrieker was very enjoyable film for a one time watch and a solid entry from the Full Moon franchise. It's leaps and bounds above the garbage the company pumps out now. Don't be bringing that trash in here, not in my house.  Most people wouldn't have been able to watch this movie without dosing off throughout the middle as it does get quite slow. The story really drags, but the poorly delivered lines were entertaining enough to keep us engaged. Plus we were waiting for a Shrieker appearance which we felt would happen at any given time. What we really needed was a heavy dose of creature action. Movies like to keep the creature hidden to add suspense, but when it's a low budget, direct to video entry the creature should dominate the screen. It would have been better just to follow the creature around as it grunted and screamed all day long as opposed to a crew of un-likeable college students. Especially students that are content to live like the dregs of society to save on student housing funds. It's obviously such a ridiculous plot, but that in lies the charm of the 90's horror B.",1369699200,3,3610,4.516819571865444
1342201,3,B00004RF2N,"Definitely horror-lite, Shrieker is a movie that welcomes ridicule.  Point of fact, the Shrieker rarely shrieks.  At times, it sounds more like a dog, once it sounded decidedly piggish.  Not exactly the stuff of nightmares.  The plot suffers from too many comparisons to other horror films (not the least of which was Curse of the Demon).  The acting is uneven to say the least, with Tanya Dempsey (Clark) the worst of the lot, giving a flat performance that completely betrays any emotion she's trying to produce.  I've seen house flies do a better job.  At the other end of the spectrum is Parry Shen (who actually went on to have a lengthy career as an actor), going beyond the call of duty by overdoing every scene he's in.  The dialog is stilted, leaving everyone sounding unnatural.  The setup is lost during the opening credits, some mumbo jumbo about alchemists and a traveler between worlds, appeasing a master, some abomination, marking five people for sacrifice, yadda-yadda-yadda.  And wouldn't you know it, five people are squatting in an abandoned hospital just as a sixth person is asked to join their unlucky number.  But wait, what's this, there's a seventh person hiding on the premises!  An expert in all things Shrieker!  That doesn't sound too suspicious.  Conveniently, they all forget rule number one: never investigate scary noises when it's better to delegate.  Along the way we learn a nasty purpose for calligraphy, that communism isn't all it's cracked up to be, and just because you've given to going shirtless doesn't mean you're obviously gay.  Where there's smoke there's bound to be obscure symbols burning on the floor.  Just because you're creepy doesn't mean you're the villain of the piece, although in this case..............",1369699200,,1763,5.024137931034483
1342202,3,B00004RF2N,"I was really glad that I got one of the out of print DVD copies of this for Christmas. I had been really curious about this movie ever since my sister gave me an old Shrieker poster. She said the movie was cheesy and I said that that was perfect than LOL. I like cheesy movies. And well.....she was right. Don't get me wrong, the movie was interesting, had mostly good acting (some hot ones too), it was creepy and suspensful. The only thing I was dissapointed by was the lack of up front gore. Not that i am a freak about that stuff, I guess it was something I expected...BUT the movie was really good. I recommend it!

1342203,2,B00004RF2N,I wasn't really into this movie so much.  I was expecting horror and I thought this was more of a thriller/suspense. There was a lot of dialouge and overall the movie went too slow.  The action is few and far between and some of the film is grainy.  I'm going to have to say 2.5 for this one.,1205539200,2,292,4.0
1342204,3,B00004RF2N,"I liked this movie - it was campy, goofy and just plain fun to watch - a real no-brainer.",1163030400,2,89,3.736842105263158
1342205,4,B00004RF2N,"This is about some college kids that move into an abandoned hospital (because it's cheaper than the dorms).  Little do they know that a mass murder took place there years earlier.  Soon strange things start happening - mysterious symbols appear in the hallway, there's a weird guy living in the cellar, shrieking noises are heard in the night.  Then, one of them disappears - EEK!

This is a pretty good movie overall.  I liked the creepy atmosphere of the abandoned hospital, and the characters all had distinct personalities and had fairly good chemistry with each other.  I'd definitely recommend it to fans of low budget, somewhat cheesy horror movies.",1129075200,7,656,4.972477064220183

7920815,3,B00004RF2N,"No nudity, no sex, no blood or gore of note, and poor creature effects. Kick up the budget a tad and throw in someone willing to to get raunchy and this could be a cult classic. As it stands it is just a slightly above par network TV horror film. I wanted to be really harsh but this has a lot of the elements of a good horror creature feature but simply doesn't deliver in the end.",1418515200,,382,3.9740259740259742

Doesn't have a true beginning, no real reason for existing, other than to be stumbled upon, this entity comes and goes too easily for these students to comprehend, but someone is responsible.

7920820,3,B00004RF2N,Decent low budget horror film. The monster looks a bit like Rick Baker's early work. Acting is amateurish but earnest.,1401235200,,118,4.95
7920821,5,B00004RF2N,"Not a lot of shock and awe, but an interesting movie nonetheless.  For me it seemed different than most of the formulaic teen/college student die one by one.  No, it seemed to me that more thought went into this movie than that and I did appreciated that.  The acting was good, and I think there was real chemistry between the actors, the setting was cool from my perspective, and  well thought out.  I like the idea all in all.

So, you have a 'massacre' that occurred 50 years ago in a hospital(the opening scene), two young orderly's loose their lives to a creature.  As credits roll you learn something about the creature and where it comes from and why.  The movie then jumps ahead 50 years.  You have broke college students squatting in the old hospital complex, a very cool idea really, they each have a different major, one or two you'd want if you wanted power and water in an old building.  There is a mystery person in the basement, and someone isn't what they seem.  Someone wants to bring back the Shrieker for their own nefarious reasons and chaos ensues.

To be sure it's a B monster movie, but there's nothing wrong with that.  We love B-horror movies!!  There isn't any gore, not a lot of sex, don't recall any nudity but a few f-bombs.  All and all, I'd watch this again.  Yeah, I was totally entertained!!!",1393027200,,1325,4.481171548117155
