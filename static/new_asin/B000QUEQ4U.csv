2840952,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Imagine if Harry Potter grew up to be Philip Marlowe, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what ""The Dresden Files"" is like.

While it starts weakly -- and is rarely faithful to Jim Butcher's novels -- ""The Dresden Files"" manages to whip itself into a solid supernatural-mystery series, with a pretty good cast and some genuinely twisty-turny mysteries. And, of course, a snarky ghost living inside a skull.

Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne) is Chicago's only wizard-for-hire, with a tragic past, a hockey-stick staff, and a companion spirit named Bob who lives in a skull (Terrence Mann). He's also perpetually in bad with the wizard council, and moderately famous among the supernatural crowds lurking around Chicago.

As the series opens, Harry is approached by a young boy who claims he's being stalked by otherworldly forces -- and his mother confirms that he's been followed by blackbirds, crows and ravens ever since he was born. Even worse, a skinned body is found in a nearby apartment -- and the malevolent skinwalker who stole the woman's dermis may be after the boy as well.

Arguably the premiere is the weakest of the series, since there's little actual detecting going on. But things perk up in the following episodes. Harry tackles a hellspawn in love, a serial killer murdering werewolves, a bodysnatching murderer, a fertility clinic with a dark secret, a bunch of young thieves using deadly magic, and an attempt to frame Bianca, the sultry vampire club-owner.

Things get even worse when Harry is trapped with a bunch of hostile wizards inside a deadly cloud, which can only have been conjured by one of them. And when Bob is stolen, Harry finds himself confronting his cruel uncle Justin -- whom Harry ""self-defensed to death"" five years ago.

""The Dresden Files"" are only loosely based on the Jim Butcher novels -- it's not as dark or as complex, and a lot of characters are changes. But take it as its own animal, and it ends up being a very solid detective series... albeit one where the suspects and victims just happen to be vampires, devils, lycanthropes, incubi and necromancers.

The plots are genuinely mysterious and gritty, sometimes with genuinely surprising answers, and odd twists on typical urban-fantasy, like vampire junkies. The stories are kept from being too grim by Bob, who provides some witty dialogue to offset the cop-style stuff (""And you wonder why your life is an unending series of insurmountable intellectual, financial and emotional hurdles!"").

If the series has a problem, it's that sometimes they overuse the handheld camera, especially in fight scenes. And the CGI ranges from decent (Bianca's vampire transformations) to somewhat hokey (dragon, werewolves), but not bad considering.

Blackthorne is just right for the role: quirky, likable, and a little bit charming. Mann makes a brilliant foil as a damned ghost, who provides hilarious, slightly pervy information for every occasion, and Conrad Coates is good as the rigid Morgan, who is just waiting for a chance to behead Harry. Unfortunately Valerie Cruz is far too dewy-eyed to make a convincing hardcore cop -- she's completely eclipsed by the hilarious Claudia Black in ""Other Dick.""

The first season of the ""Dresden Files"" has its flaws, but it's still an enjoyable, suspenseful urban fantasy series that gives a new spin to the lone-wolf detective. Definitely worth watching.",1182643200,132,3394,5.066308243727598
2840953,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I have this dvd pre-ordered, and I really want to have my hands around them, because I really liked the serie, and loved Paul Blackthorne as a steamy and hot wizard. The stories of each epidose were well paced, the plots interesting, and I loved the characters of Dresden and of Murphy, and wanted to see more of Bob, so different from the skull of the books.

The only thing I didn't liked was that Dresden always had to kiss the woman that appeared on the episode. Even when in one of the episodes the woman had tried to kill him. I was expecting for him not to kiss her, but he did. Bullocks!

Anyway, bring it on, we want Dresden!!!

And i really want to see 'Bad Blood', my fav episode of the first season! ;)",1182556800,10,714,4.197080291970803
2840954,5,B000QUEQ4U,"It only took me a few episodes to really fall in love wit this show.  It's by turns funny, smart, sweet, and dramatic.  Paul Blackthorne plays a wizard with a quirky, down the earth humanity that is fun and refreshing, and Terrence Mann completely steals every scene he is in as the comic, perpetually horny Bob.  It's the chemestry between these two characters that  powers some of the show's best moments of comedy and drama.

Jim Butcher's books (a wonderful read) have been adapted here to work as a tv show with some substantial changes, but I can understand the reasoning behind them.  Some thing that work well in the books would not have worked as well in such a visual medium as tv, and the vast, complex plots that build through the series have been reduced to what can work in 45 minutes.  But there is the hint of a broader mythology in the show benieth the surface that could be expanded if Sci-fi continues the show for another season.",1181952000,10,949,4.514619883040936
2840955,5,B000QUEQ4U,"i started to watch the series then read the books, i love them both. Although there are differences between the two they are both that great you don't really care.  They picked a brilliant cast, Paul Blackthorne is the perfect choice for Harry, Valerie Cruz is great as Murphy, although they changed her character a lot compared to the books, and Bob is completely different in the book yet Terrence Mann as Bob is amazing (they really need to develop him more)  I am sure there will be some fans of the books that will be disappointed by the huge character changes, but me, i think they work well with the show.
 In fact i have come to think of the novel series and the tv series as two completely different entities and couldn't really say which one i loved more.

 I just hope it gets released as a region 2 very soon as my dvd player is not multi and i am from the UK",1181865600,10,871,4.22289156626506
2840956,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Excellent show here! Imagine actually advertising that you are a Wizard! If that's not enough, He uses his magic in Full view of others and dismisses his magics as ""tricks"". You are on ""probation"" via the ""high council"" because you used the black aka black magic. now to atone you work for the Wardins of the council making sure the supernatural beings, Entitys, and the like (vampires, werewolves and some things we have never seen) don't break any rules! this is an excellent series and I hope they add tons of extras Pre Order Now before you end up paying a fortune for a masterpiece!
5 stars all the way!

The Extras:
The extras that come with this DVD set are minimal. There are two audio commentaries on the following episodes, ""Rules of Engagement"" (Disc 1) and ""Things That Go Bump"" (Disc 3) with the same three commentators, director Michael Grossman, actor Paul Blackthorne, and writer and executive producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe. Both commentaries are by-the-book, with the usual background information about each episode and some interesting anecdotes about the show.

""Inside The Dresden Files"" is an 18-minute segment that features on-camera interviews with the principal cast and crew members who talk about the various challenges they faced in bringing the Dresden character to the small screen and also the various aspects of filming the show, from location to special effects.

Finally there are three brief ""Deleted Scenes"" that can be accessed on Disc 1",1181433600,10,1792,5.481884057971015
2840957,5,B000QUEQ4U,I had never read the Jim Butcher series until the team of Harry and Bob arrived on Sci Fi. I am truly captivated by the sights sounds and truly rich dialogue of Bob and Harry along with all the supporting characters. I agree with other reviews when they say Bob was changed for the better. I truly love the wit and sarcasm of the whole show! Lets hope Sci Fi doesn't shelve it. (which seems to happen every time I find a show that is truly outstanding.),1181001600,9,453,4.218390804597701
2840958,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I've been a Dresden fan for years, having read the books by Jim Butcher and a couple of short stories.  To say that I was thrilled that SciFi made the series is being mild.  While there are inconsistencies in the show, (Lt. Murphy in the book is blonde and her first name is Karryn, while on TV she is a brunette, Hispanic named Connie to mention  but one), they have not yet been overly irksome.  Paul Blackthorne does a great job of portraying Harry's self-dreprecating self of humor and is close to my mental image of Harry that I've formed over the years.  I think the series will continue to build a fan base, if SciFi gives it a chance, and could lead into a big-screen version of one of the novels!  I truly hope that SciFi gives this show a chance to flourish as they have other programs.  The Dresden Files is an intellectual program that requires its viewers to think while they are enjoying the show.  Television at large is almost bereft of shows with these qualities!",1180483200,16,980,4.435754189944134
2840959,5,B000QUEQ4U,"After Buffy went off the air, and then Charmed, I despaired of finding a supernatural show with quality writing and great plots.  My prayers were answered by the Scifi network with this awesome show.

I was already a fan of the book series and this show does an excellent job of adapting the stories written by Jim Butcher.  Like in Charmed, magic exists but regular people don't know about it.  Harry Dresden is the only Wizard P.I. in the phone book.  Most think he's a crack pot, but some know he is their only hope.  He works as a consultant to the police via Det. Murphy on those cases considered bizarre.  Along the way there are werewolf serial killers, vampire club owners, and innocents that need to be protected.

The show doesn't overdo the special effects, rather using them less frequently but with greater impact.  Which is actually in keeping with the books.  Harry is faithfully recreated and played by Paul Blackstone.  And then there is Bob.  The portrayal of Bob is one of those rare instances where a book character has been drastically changed, but in a good way.  In the books he is an incorporeal spirit residing in a skull.  This is fine in the books where a reader's imagination is boosting the concept, but would not translate well to TV.  Producers cleverly decided to make him a human-looking ghost with a dry wit and snappy dialog.  They did it so well, Bob quickly became my favorite character!

If you like fantasy or scifi shows, get the Dresden Files.  And when you can't get enough of Harry, get the books.",1180396800,344,1540,4.599264705882353
2840960,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Given the shakey start from having episodes juxtaposed in viewing order this season really took off with a bang! After watching just the first episode it intrigued me enough to want to go out and buy the whole series of books by Jim Butcher and I was not disappointed. Absolute page turners mixed with great characters, sly wit, wicked sarcasm, fantastic magic, and of course -- Bob! I really like how the TV show transformed the simple talking skull into a viewable character, played by none other than the superbly casted, Terrance Mann. And of course Paul Blackthorne as Harry Dresden was a brilliant decision. He has managed to capture Harry's self-depracating humor, sarcasm, and flair for drama and magic along with his vulnerable side and inevitable confrontation with the forces of evil. If you enjoy the books you will love the great adaptation they have done on bringing the world of the Dresden Files to life on screen. Given they showed the original pilot out of order as Episode 8 and trimmed down to 40 minutes from the original 2 hours, I can't wait to see the bonus features on this disc! A wizard detective in modern day Chicago... what else could you ask for?",1179792000,163,1177,4.718446601941747

2840990,3,B000QUEQ4U,"I'm a huge fan of the books and after reading them all, I was both excited and curious about a live action show. The show is okay, but it is missing many key points.
1. No Blue Beetle
2. No long leather duster
3. The staff is all wrong
4. Murphy is a blonde not a brunette
5. Bob is a spirit of intellect, and in the show he comes off a tad stupid, plus he's kept a secret in the books, in the show he's not. Bob manifests in human form on the show, but does not in the books
6. Lots of action in the books, lots of magic, but in the show not much of any, maybe it was low budget. It just doesn't seem right not having Harry shouting his two key spells, forzare and fuego
7. Not enough inner monologue in the show, leaves the audience guessing or just assumes they have read the books. Example: no explanation about wizards and electronics

I feel as if the those who created the show didn't read the books. I believe the writers took a story with real potential and didn't give it enough 'magic' to be successful. The actors did their best and it's not their fault. Is it entertaining? Yes to a point. But die hard fans of the books might have a hard time adjusting to the changes. I know I did.",1512518400,,1196,4.046413502109704

2840992,3,B000QUEQ4U,"Perfect condition, still wrapped, shine and new.

This show is horrible. It's more like odd jobs. What if we took a new actor and put him on easy to solve by the end of the episode cases with all the same supporting rolls except everyone is in Buffy the vampire style makeup?",1511913600,,275,4.288461538461538

2841013,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I've always been a sucker for a good supernatural story set in reality - Brimstone, Forever Knight, Dresden Files.  It's like Harry Potter for adults.

Don't understand why anyone would trash the TV show because it's not like the books.  It's like trashing Star Wars because Captain Kirk wasn't in it.  Get over it - Bob as a disembodied spirit voice doesn't make for good television.

Great writing and disappointed the show ran only 1 season.",1503705600,3,444,4.7894736842105265
2841014,1,B000QUEQ4U,"This show is garbage. I loved the books. But just in the first episode Bob has an actual form instead of glowing eye sockets in a skull, Harry is driving a Jeep instead of a VW, technology works around him, his dead mother gave him a shield bracelet instead of a pentacle necklace, Karen Murphy has a child when in the books she does not, the skinwalker is not a naagloshii and that happened in the LAST BOOK and they are showing it in the first episode.
BTW that is just the continuity problems in the VERY FIRST EPISODE!!!!

I admit that I haven't seen this show in a long while. But here are some details that really bothered me. Dresden is turned into a cliche. He is after the murderer who killed his mother (in the early books he didn't care because he didn't know her). His shield bracelet was made by her, instead of by himself. One of the episodes involves these crow demon things protecting a young wizard from the wizards counsel.

2841057,4,B000QUEQ4U,"The producers/writers didn't work terribly hard to be faithful to the books, which are fantastic.  This makes sense in some cases, because the books are much more complex in terms of the story, and the special effects budget would have been off the charts.  So the TV series can be forgiven for simplifying the scripts quite a bit.  But many of the characters seem miscast based on what we know from the books (granted, this may only annoy the book readers, but I would think that would make up a significant part of the audience, and may have explained why the show didn't get the ratings that it needed to survive past one season).  The one change from the books that I enjoyed was the representation of Bob.  But what got a 4 star rating out of me, and why I would still recommend watching the show, is Paul Blackthorne.  Whatever else the showrunners got wrong, they got the casting of Harry Dresden perfect, in my opinion.",1485302400,,927,4.520958083832335

Unfortunately I cannot separate the books and the series in my mind.  The beauty of turning books to abtv series is that you are not constrained for time (Lord of the Rings) and need to take out a lot of content.  With a series you can take the time to build the characters and relationships (Game of Thrones) to build an immersive story.

This doesnt mean that the short-lived series is bad. It's just that it's...different from the book.  Butchers Harry is lives in a more lush, more Buffy-esque universe. What we get in the Lionsgate is a more toned-down, straightforward crime story. Although there is/was the potential for a lusher, expansive cosmology.

The casting is good, and Valerie Cruz, despite not being blonde, is a perfect Murphy; Blackthorn is a subtle Dresden. Mann as Bob is a bit different. Butcher (in Ghost Stores) described Bob as having a James Dean look, so our Bob is very different.

It's all different. But if we grant that this is a different time-line, and take the changes for what they are, it's a fun choice. Although the texture of relationship Bob has with Harry is different. Bob here is clearly the mentor, whereas Bob in the novels is more of an database who is in need of mentoring as much as he mentors.

The production values a great, considering that this is a LA-Vancouver production. Which explains Harry using a hockey-stick instead of his staff.

Sadly, this series was cut short. But like the 1975 Doc Savage film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Savage-The-Man-of-Bronze/dp/B00264QI68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze</a>), what we have is not perfect, but it is close enough to be worth the watchdespite any flaws.",1478822400,14,1862,6.432

I really enjoy the books and that always raises the bar. I did my best to approach the TV series with an open mind and ignore the little inconsistencies. Naturally, I wish the casting was more true to the book descriptions and it took me a while to put aside that he's not using his blasting rod and pentacle, or living in a basement apartment. I like how they dealt with the challenge of Bob; as a human person vs. red light or a talking skull, he's a much more effective character. The shorter episode format (vs. novel length storylines) gives the viewer an opportunity to meet more characters and explore more areas of magic quickly. It's an entertaining, action packed, darkly comedic take on a wizard and I like it. It's like Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix meets BoschHarry Dresden's tortured past motivates him to make the world a better place one case at a time.",1473984000,,930,4.541666666666667

2841205,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Oh how I wish this T.V. show would come back and continue the story of Harry Dresden, but I doubt it will happen. The show is based on one of my favorite series of novels. I would say I'm impartial but that would be a lie as I love the characters, so I will do my best. The actor who plays Harry does a very spot on job and seems to have fun playing him. The actress who plays Murphey does well, but I think they played her down a little. Morgan makes me want to high-five him in the face with a brick so that is spot on. As for changes, well in the books Harry drives a VW Beetle and in the series he is driving an old jeep. Its not a huge thing, but it is noticeable to fans. Harry's cat is missing from the series which is very interesting considering you find things out about him later in the novels so to leave him out was a huh moment. It felt like they tried to do more than  one book in the first series and though that is not bad, I don't know if they did them both well. In closing let me say this, as a big fan of the books I am probably a little more critical than some, but don't take me being critical as this being a bad show. It is not, it is a very GOOD show and I recommend it and the novels to any fan of Sci-fi and fantasy.",1467244800,5,1244,3.7846153846153845

They made it so phones, computers, ect shorted out when he used majic around them, but he didn't really explane at the time.

I know there is literary license, but some people shouldn't be given literary license if they can't do a better job than this.  I read where they had a very low budget, so that could have been part of it.  It's too bad it wasn't picked up by a major station and given the budget they would need to make this an excellent series.

I can say that if you have read the books and have finally decided to watch the show, you won't be disappointed. The movie accurately reflects the books. Harry Dresden looks like I imagined him and acts as he does in the books. There are a few minor changes, such as the wand he carries in the book becomes a hocky stick in the show. The one change that was big was the character of Bob. In the books Bob is a ghost like being that stays in a skull and only comes out with approval, often using the cat as a body.  In the show Bob is a character that lives and breaths and looks like a human and is not stuck in a skull. Mostly though the show does reflect the books.

Because this is only the first season, those who have read all of the Dresden books will be able to accurately say that the books are darker than this show.

If you haven't read the books but just wonder if you might like this show, I can say that I completely enjoyed this show. If you enjoy a little bit of science fiction/fantasy, if you enjoy watching shows about the underdog who does well, if you enjoy a little bit of mystery and a little bit of magic- you will probably enjoy this show.

You'll be SO disappointed. Dresden is supposed to be 6 feet 6 inches tall. Murphy is supposed to be blonde and 5 feet nothing -- ""Tiny but tough"" (a quote from one of the books). The actress chosen for Murphy did do a pretty good job of being cute but tough. But Dresden came across pretty lame, pretty helpless. The TV series was only one season.

I'd suggesting watching on a dark and stormy night, with a mug of hot cocoa. The concept is well realized in the transition from book to DVD, and the choice of actors is perfect. You can easily imagine that if there were to be a spell casting private eye, Paul Blackthorne would fit the bill. Terrence Mann convincingly plays Dresden's side-kick, an ancient sorcerer cursed to exist in ghost-ish form inside a skull for eternity, bound to the will of the one who possesses the skull.

That and everyone knows Harry got the amulet from his mother not the shield bracelet. And the biggie...no beat up Blue Beetle. But I think the thing that really bothers me most about the entire season is that Harry is presented as an inept, bumbling wizard and he was never that even at the beginning of the book series.

The Sci-Fi network where this show ran, was and continues to be striving for failure by cancelling well written, well produced, and exceptionally acted programming, and running low-brow, low budget schlock.  The Dresden Files has the potential for stories to last many seasons, with viewership growing (through the first season), and loyalty developing that could rival some of the biggest science fiction followings.  Sci-Fi is going the way of MTV...you know, that channel on cable that used to show music videos?  If Sci-Fi wanted to keep their audience, they'd bring back The Dresden Files.  That being said, this short-lived (12 episodes) series is most definitely worth the watch!

I'm a little disappointed that Bob, the disembodied spirit living in a human skull in Harry's basement, turns out to be a human actor, but I suppose that is to be expected in a visual medium like television.

2841702,5,B000QUEQ4U,"People like to hate on this series, but consider.  Given the constraints of TV with a budget, the cast and crew do a remarkable job of bringing Dresden to life. Paul Blackthorne is a physical dead ringer for Harry. His dialogue coach does a respectable job replacing his native British accent with a cynical gumshoe Chicago palaver. And then there's Bob. The very live Terry Mann gives emotional depth to the character to an extent that would be unmatchable outside of a completely animated series. For my money, Valerie Cruz absolutely nails the role of Murphy. Physically, she's taller and brunettier (I'm sure that must be a word), but she perfectly portrays a no-nonsense just-the-facts police detective just beginning to catch on to the extent of the supernatural goings on about her.  Let's face it. Any screen portrayal of Harry Dresden is going to fall short of perfection. As Jim Butcher was heard to say recently at Dragoncon, ""I think my imagination has a bigger budget than the Sci-Fi Channel.""  I like this series. I wish there could be more.",1410652800,,1055,4.85

2841705,4,B000QUEQ4U,"When I first saw this series on SYFY I didn't like it as much -- classic case of it not living up to the book series in my head.  Watching it now, I realize I was a bit  harsh. Well, of course the books are better, they aren't confined to telling their stories in 49 minute blocks, but Paul Blackthorne does a really good job as Harry Dresden, bedraggled wizard operating under a P.I. license, walking the mean streets of Chicago, trying to do some good in the world to make up for a personal and familial past of misdeeds.  Working with the Chicago P.D., which scoffs at and distrusts him while needing the results he gets, and the High Council, a ""magical police force"" that is just waiting for Harry to step out of line so they can administer their own frightening brand of justice, Harry has basically two friends -- Connie Murphy, who catches all the weird cases and needs Harry's input as much as she doesn't want to believe in the ""Wizard"" stuff, and Bob, the ghost of a sorceror  trapped for all time in his own skull.  Valerie Cruz does a good job playing Connie, although her character doesn't get to go very deep until the last episode., As Bob, I found Terence Mann just a bit too vocally ""plummy"" and British, as a voice that I'd always heard in my head when reading it as sarcastic and desperately horny.  The writing isn't as good as ""Buffy,"" which I always think is the gold standard, but really, the only fault with the series is that it got killed after one season, and they didn't have time to develop it further.",1410480000,,1532,4.376760563380282

2841789,2,B000QUEQ4U,"I have conflicted feelings about this show.

First off, it is a good supernatural drama.  Good acting by most of the cast, judicious but well-placed special effects, and some good dialogue.  If taken on its own merits, I would rate the 3 or 3.5 stars.  The lead actor plays a fairly good Dresden, but should have been provided better dialogue and direction to fully own the character.  The adaptation of ""Storm Front"" is lacking time to fully introduce us to the world, but it was an honest effort to trim the book down to 44 minutes.

Sadly, this show is burdened with being ""based on"" Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files.  I have been an avid reader of the series for years, and while I try to understand that this show is ""based on"", they got so many things wrong with the universe that it was painful to watch.  I give them credit for giving Bob's character an almost 180 degree personality shift and a different physical presence, while retaining his role in the early novels of knowledge, exposition, and comic relief.  Well done.  I do find it hard to believe that they couldn't have cast Murphy closer to the books' description, and I was disappointed that she did not get to exercise her extensive martial arts knowledge - it was a key part of showing the character as strong, independent, and able to handle herself against the supernatural.  Speaking of which, after working with Dresden and taking him on faith that there are supernatural forces at work, she is suddenly shocked in the last couple of episodes to see him work magic.  I take issue with the prop department not spending the money on Harry's staff.  Every good wizard needs a staff or wand.  The hockey stick and drumstick felt like a cheap budget cut.  Finally, while I think they got good mileage out of their special effects, not once do we get to see Harry let loose with ""Fuego!"", which is usually a highlight in the books as he torches (or at least attempts to torch) some being from another plane of existence.  I felt cheated to not see this happen even once over the course of the series.

Ultimately, this series is hurt by its association to the source material.",1410048000,,2145,4.5732984293193715

He's what brings me to watch the next episode instead of TruBlood.  Murphy, the police detective foil, is not as tough or engaging as the books and the actress (not sure who) is not impressive period.

2842095,3,B000QUEQ4U,"I am a devoted fan of the books. The fact that this shares a title offends me, as Jim Butcher's works in this world tend to deserve a five-star plus rating.

This, as a TV series, merited cancellation. It's a solid ""brain-goo"" series, where the content is neither offensive nor particularly interesting, but the fact that it is crowding out the possibility of a truly good series DEEPLY offends me.

Harry, Murphy, and Bob have virtually no relation to the books, and that irritates me beyond belief. Mr. Butcher established worthwhile characters, and none of them arrived in this show. Harry becoming a womanizing bastard as opposed to a deeply distrustful and antisocial intellectual just broke the camel's back.",1407542400,,714,4.991596638655462

2842124,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I guess that I am a sucker for fairly tales, magic, the medieval (but NOT occult!). Like very much Grimm on NBC, the new Sleepy Hollow thing. Taking old thinking and old ways and then finding ways to interpret/merge it into the modern world is pretty creative. Somehow, you can tell that this is Canadian (thank you to all our neighbors to the North!). Less frenetic, less sexual situations, a kind of gentleness to the characters. Those who don't like things medieval, magic, and who do not suspend disbelief well will probably not like this. Know thyself, and if ye be self-judged worthy of secret knowledge, ye may enjoy this one. Not quite as fast paced as others, so keep that in mind.

If you are looking for that - stick with the books.  If you watch this as a fun series - similar to but not the same as the books - it's great.  This got 4 stars since 4.5 isn't possible.

Casting and writing is pretty good. The books are so complex with all the plot turns and what not that it's kind of strange to see Dresden to focus on one discreet, unrelated case each episode. And I miss him bribing the fairies with pizza.

2842279,4,B000QUEQ4U,I found the series to be quite enjoyable.  It was a pleasant surprise after reading through the books.  Blackthorne made for a pretty believable Harry Dresden.  Some of the characters I had a hard time marrying up to the visions of the characters I had based on the book.  Morgan was one that just never seemed to compare to what I expected.,1405468800,,341,4.451612903225806

Great characters, well acted, well written, lots of action (balanced with story line and character development), humor, romance, etc.. What more do you want? I loved this show, and it joins a much too long list of exceptional shows that didn't make it past a season or two.

The guy that plays the ""wizard"" is earthy and, in my humble opinion (IMHO) a really good actor. Bob, the ghost in the skull was humorous and sarcastic. The special effects were not stupendous but watchable for a TV show and the stories were fun.

If you have never seen the show and already love the Dresden books, beware that there are definite differences in the two. Luckily for me, I started with the television series and have had the fun of enjoying both the books and the videos equally! I recommend the series highly!!

Kind of sounds like the ""Arrow"" vigilantism doesn't it? Yep!

2842383,5,B000QUEQ4U,"It's too bad this didn't get more than 1 season.  It's a fun show and had potential.  I feel like the episodes were out of order to some degree or they just weren't sure where to go with the episodic nature.  Each episode is good and plays like an old-school narrator (Harry Dresden) driven detective show.  Who's the villian and how are we going to catch them?  What kind of magical impediments are there to the progress of the story and how will Harry magically resolve those without his partner from the Chicago PD find out?

Overall, this is definitely fun if you're into the Urban/Supernatural fantasy genre and worth watching.  The last couple episodes are the strongest in my opinion.",1404172800,,691,4.661157024793388

2842387,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I enjoyed the Dresden Files when they came out on TV, but recently I've read all of the books and there are some problems that bother me about it.
1.  Don't base a character on the show as totally different from the books.  The two characters that drove me crazy in the show are Bianca and Butters.  Bianca in the books is one of Harry's greatest enemies and causes him all kinds of strive for many years.  Butters is portrayed as a goofy overnerdish M.E.  He is a nerd, as is Harry and the pound puppies, but he isn't goofy or as strange as he is portrayed.
2.  The way that they did Bob was almost spot on, how else could you do him.  However he acts a bit as Harry's conscience, and  as we all know it's the other way around.
3.  They missed Mac's Bar.
4.  They only use his problems with technology when it suits them.
5.  Justin is much more evil in the books.
6.  I had a problem with his staff and wand.  These were intricate and powerful tools, not a simple hockey stick and a drumstick.
They had runes and mystical carvings all over them.
7.  Jeep was nice, but what was wrong with the blue beetle?
8.  The casting for Dresden, Murphy, Carmichael (Carmody) and Bob were perfect.
Unfortunately the series was cut too short to develop the full world, but if it gets you into the books, it's worth the ride.",1404086400,,1313,4.216867469879518

2842390,5,B000QUEQ4U,Relaxed acting with some self-deprecation makes for a very believable portrayal.  This is not an unbeatable hero saving the world again and again.  Stuff happens and he struggles to deal with it.,1403913600,,195,5.0625
2842391,5,B000QUEQ4U,A wonderful story with top notch acting. It is a shame that it was discontinued. It reminds me of what happened to Firefly.,1403913600,,123,4.391304347826087

A shame really because the shows are outstanding, as a whole and individually. The actors are top-notch. The guy who plays Dresden is perfect, Bob also, and I have a huge crush on Murphy. Yes there is some Hollywood diversion from the exact ideas in the books, (such as the ""White Council"" from the books is called the ""High Council"" in the TV shows, & Bob the ghost is a full person, not just a skull.)

2842475,5,B000QUEQ4U,"It is a supernatural series with many twists and turns. Good plots, humorous and unusual events. Instead of a wand, Dresden uses a hockey stick.

If your looking for the stories to be just like the one's in the books you will be disappointed. There are only a couple that follow the outlines of a couple of the books.

This series exposed me to what has become on of my families favorite character.  Syfy didn't put there best foot forward when they did this I will say.

2842503,4,B000QUEQ4U,I'm not sure why this series didn't last more than one season. It reminds me of Castle with the lead character as a struggling modern day wizard. It took a while for the relationship between the lead characters to develop so maybe viewers or the network execs didn't have the patience. We live in the day of instant gratification.,1403308800,,330,4.610169491525424
2842504,5,B000QUEQ4U,"One of my favorite short-lived series ever.  The books are fantastic, and could have (still can) provided an endless well of storylines to draw from.  The show avoided some of the wilder elements that might have required a bigger budget, and focused more on the murder/mystery aspect - but with magic.  And monsters.  What's not to like?  The hardest part in a show like this is believability - in the plot and in the characters.  And they had it from the beginning.

They got the important bits in there, they are true to the feel of the narrative doing an excellent job in translating the humor from the written word to live action.  Some of the variances are kind of fun, I like the hockey stick as the wizard staff, and if they were going to replace the blue beetle, they at least chose a vehicle with character to replace it with.

I've read that the episodes are out of order, but I'm not sure that is correct...I watched the first episodes in the suggested order (from another reviewer) but it felt a bit clunky.  I looked up the rest on episode guide and followed it from there and it flowed much better.  In total honesty, the other reviewer(s) who noted the suggested viewing order may be correct; In the end...it doesn't matter, they are fun episodes independently from each other and if there were a second season, I'd watch it.

Total disclosure: I've found that I really, really like Paul Blackthorne.  I first saw him in the Christmas Episode of Warehouse 13.  Then I saw him in Arrow...he was great in both.  When I saw this and that he was starring; it was a no brainer.

Do you like action?
Do you have a fancy for old school, detective, film noir overtones?
Do you really like Paul Blackthorne?

I suspect that the show was ""too well done"" and so had to be canned .  Mediocrity must reign supreme!  Bummer.

But we can all use more of those poorly acted teen angst dramas with wolf and vampire themes, obligatory bad acting and scripts, right?  'cause, you know, the little peeps need legions of emo role models to distract them from the horrible economy that awaits them when they stick there heads up.

Maybe we could have another teen angst series were the wolf chick teen hottie teams up with the slightly older vampire stud in order to serve fries to their beat down, working stiff customers using their special abilities?  Of course, this cutting edge drama will be different because it will deal with the important teen issues of LGBT politics and bullying.  The working people will just be like hollow props, warning signs of what you might become if you don't buy the hippest clothes and facial products.  This new series might go by the title ""Vampire on a Stick"" or some such self deprecating yet campy and cool title.

Each episode should squeeze out maximal emotional content.  The season climax will involve the heroes both finding that tuition at the community college has doubled and there pay has been cut to the minimum: ""Times is tough, kids!"" says the manager. Will the couple need to forestall their dreams of attending the Community College when summer ends  Will Vamp-hunk have to sell his Porsche and down size to a Smart car?

There is a ""High Council"" that rules over the supernatural and there are times Harry walks a fine line between white and black magic in order to solve the crimes.

I think the series would have been better served by each book being it's own season(like Game of Thrones.)  Paul Blackthorne overall plays Dresden as I thought he should be in real life, just shorter (Dresden in the book is around 6' 5"" I believe.)  Dresden however is more forceful and less of a manslut (a lot less) in the books than in the show.  Overall I would recommend the series.",1401667200,,569,4.2407407407407405

This time casting should try to stick closer to the characters and not change it up.  The charm of the Dresden chronicles is that Harry is not a super hero.  He is just a schmuck who has natural magical talents.  He makes bad decisions while trying to help people he loves.  In other words, any of us could be him easily.  So when one has to live in Chicago, you can imagine all types of misfortunes waiting to happen when you are the only one in the way of evil.  Bring back Harry in the book-form.

2842898,4,B000QUEQ4U,"First, let me be perfectly clear in that I never EVER expect books and tv series based on books to have much in common besides character names.  That being said, Paul Blackthorne makes a decent Harry Dresden.  Terrence Mann as ""Bob"" steals every scene he is in - and is one of the rare occasions where my mind's eye of Bob and the casting came together.  Valerie Cruz has the right police angst for Detective Murphy - although in the book her name is Karen and she is a petite blond; in the show Valerie Cruz is Connie and is a willowy brunette. You can't have everything. The series only lasted a season, partly because instead of coming up with TV plots and arcs, they tried to condense books into episodes...so it was a little like watching someone retell a story you read and because of their time constraints and personal perspectives, they leave out bits you liked and it doesn't quite sound the same.
If they had used the characters and created new story lines - stories about the smaller adventures that happen between books, they might still be around. Still - I love the books so much that the series gets love too!  And since I can't have my dream cast in a Dresden movie, I can at least get a Dresden fix when I am short on time and watch these episodes on Amazon Prime.",1399593600,,1282,4.373949579831932

2842938,5,B000QUEQ4U,I wish the SyFy channel had given this series another season or two and more of a chance at surviving. Why? Because I love Paul Blackstone who does a fine job with the character Harry Dresden. The supporting cast is equally entertaining as they all try to solve mysteries of the supernatural variety. If I have one complaint though it's that in the books Harry is more of a wizard while in the series he seems reluctant to use his innate skills for getting rid of the foes by conjuring up wind and fire through his hockey stick. It was an unique series back in 2007. It's still better than many shows given a chance in the market today.,1399420800,,636,4.352941176470588

I liked the main characters Harry Dresden and ""Bob"", and Lt. Murphy.  I have enjoyed almost the entire series but it wasn't as engaging as other series I have seen.  It seemed there was not much harmony with any of the characters.  Perhaps I was hoping Bob would be more integral in the plots. And I thought the love interest between Dresden and Murphy could have developed better.  Seemed they liked each other less by the end of the series (I haven't seen the last episode yet so perhaps that will change).  I would like to see the high council get better developed in the future but looks like since there is no follow on seasons, we will be left to wonder.  Sorry to see it didn't make the cut.

2843107,4,B000QUEQ4U,"If you are a fan of the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher you are probably hoping this show is going to bring his world to life. Well it doesn't. Which it seems I read or heard somewhere that this was done intentionally, don't quote me though. If you approach this show as just a show with no knowledge of the books or completely separate, it is enjoyable. I am a stickler about books being adapted because they are never the same & lately Hollywood hasn't even tried to follow the books they adapt. Luckily a friend told me this was nothing like the books so I was prepared to view it differently & therefor enjoyed it.

Now, all that being said I will review the show. The show follows our hero Harry as he tries to help people while also dealing with his own ""demons"". It had a good start & unlike the books it delves into Harry's past quickly so you can understand him better. They took characters from the books & did weave them into the story but changed the majority in major ways. I do not find that the changes affect the story in a bad way. Knowing how a TV series must run & build upon itself the changes make sense. The changes that are annoying are really just aesthetics that I don't understand why they needed to be changed at all, for instance in the books Harry carries a staff but in the show he carries a hockey stick. I found that annoying because honestly have you ever seen a wizard with a hockey stick? I did enjoy the Bob changes & found I actually enjoyed this Bob more. The show has enough mystery to keep you interested. It also has plenty of the supernatural. The actors do a great job in their respective roles & for the most part the character personalities carried over from the books. All the makings for a great show are there. I think if the show had been allowed to continue it probably would have built a good following.

I recommend that you give the Dresden Files a chance. Just remember to approach it as a show only, not an adaptation. If you haven't read the books then after you finish watching the show read them. They are great & will keep you coming back for more.",1398211200,,2104,4.28391959798995

2843147,5,B000QUEQ4U,I enjoyed Dresden files when it was televised several years ago.  Blackthorne does an excellent job of portraying Dresden. The episodes are entertaining and internally consistent.,1397779200,,179,5.884615384615385

2843175,3,B000QUEQ4U,"Jim's books are great fun, but the Dresden-Murphy chemistry from the books doesn't quite make it into the series. The Great Council chaps are a bit over-the-top, and Morgan doesn't hit the mark at all in my view.

2843178,5,B000QUEQ4U,This was a great detective series with a wizard that works with the police as a consultant as well as private clients.  A rich background and magical organization to add drama to the wizards life.,1397347200,,196,4.6
2843209,5,B000QUEQ4U,You will like this show. Only problem is that there is only one season....I enjoyed each episode and have watched them more than once !,1397260800,,135,4.44
2843210,4,B000QUEQ4U,Doesn't follow the books but still a good storyline. Harry Dresden is well casted. A little kitchy but I think that's the point. The theme song reminds me of Night Court- funny.,1397260800,,177,4.5625

2843212,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Very good show that's full of cool special effects. From what I know from my many years of practice nearly everything Dresden says about witchcraft and wizardry is accurate.  So, if you like magic and the world of the modern wizard, you should like this show. Since each episode is based on a book, it is only one season long. Nicolas Cage was the Executive Director.  Paul Blackthorne does a great job of being just a regular guy with cool skills. Of course Bob is a really cool ghost.",1397174400,,486,4.449438202247191

2843216,5,B000QUEQ4U,"This is the most fun I've had watching a tv show. Why t his show is no longer being aired is beyond me. It's fun, quirky, and serious. Any show that can inspire me to purchase the books definitely deserves 5 stars..",1397088000,,215,4.142857142857143

2843250,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I found this show on Prime, and had been wanting to see it. Now I'm really glad I saw it and wish there was more of it. I have never read the books, so I can't say if what previous reviewers is right or wrong. But I'm intending to read them now, and see  if I agree. but I really liked the main character, and Bob was great. The actors were great in their roles.  If you want to see a cool show, that doesn't have a lot of computer graphic stunts but is just a good solid show, watch this.",1397088000,,489,3.8316831683168315

2843252,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Jim Butcher says to consider the TV show an alternate universe from the books, and with that in mind, I really like the show.  Which is to say, if you're expecting it to match your take on the books, you're going to be disappointed.  But I think it is true to the spirit of the books, at least.  Paul Blackthorne makes a good Harry Dresden, very much like the early books.  It's Harry, trying to do the right thing in and for a world that doesn't believe him and trying to atone for his darker nature.

As a TV show, the writing is good, and the shows are well paced and plotted.  The effects are a little hokey.  I think most of the production money went into the sets and not into the SFX.  The episodes are out of production order, and don't entirely make sense as they are.  If you're going to watch, start with Storm Front, which introduces everyone and the world in general.  Then you can either go by production order (it's on wikipedia and in another review here) or I think it will still make sense if you watch in the aired order after that.

Only things I wish were really changed (besides the bad effects): I wish Murphy was more a partner like in the books, and too bad they couldn't fit in Thomas! ;)

In the meantime, it's holding me over until the next book comes out, and I wish there had been more seasons!",1396915200,,1324,4.231075697211155
2843253,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I got hooked on Jim Butcher's series The Dresden Files and gumshoe PI and wizard Harry Dresden by watching this on the SciFi Channel.  Yes, the SciFi Channel, not by whatever stupid-ass name they're going by now.  The character in the TV series is nothing like how he is portrayed on all the book covers.  Which to me means he's a guy you could hang out in Mac's with and have a couple beers.  The book cover guy looks more like he's a product of some female fantasy author's wet dream (eg. Laurel K Hamilton).

Anyway, the series (TV) is great for putting faces to the names in the books and it's a shame it was cut so quickly from that channel's lineup....guess they needed more room for all their ""reality"" garbage.",1396915200,,718,4.409090909090909

 I've watched 3 episodes of season 1.... all in all the characters are appealing and a lot of fun.... but Harry is not quite the same Harry thats in the novels.

Never having heard of the books or the show before, I picked the show off HULU at random because it sounded kind of interesting.  I ended up staying up far into the wee hours, watching the entire series in one sitting.  I simply couldn't get enough of Terrance Mann as Bob, especially.  I really wish the show had been renewed, especially given some of the idiot twaddle that goes on season after brainless season while shows like Dresden are cancelled.

And, where is his coat?  Staff?  Blasting rod?  Instead, he uses the bracelet in a different way, as a way of doing magic instead of as a protection and weapon.  We tried watching it as something different from the books, but it is not captivating us.  After four episodes, we are not interested any more.",1396396800,,483,4.642857142857143

Paul Blackthorne was awesome in the role and the stories engaging.  Bringing problems to a wizard is a story line you don't see every day.

2843308,3,B000QUEQ4U,"The series was enjoyable with good stories and action but it seems the screenwriters and director didn't have a firm grasp of the characters.

Terrence Mann's portrayal as Bob is okay: the Bob in the novels is probably a bit too rowdy for primetime television. Valerie Cruz isn't Murphy. Not only is she not short, blonde and childless, she's not even SI with all the trials and tribulations of having one of the least desirable positions in the Chicago Police Department. Still, she works well enough.

Paul Blackthorne isn't Harry Dresden. Despite the quips and humor, Dresden is a much darker character than the one portrayed by Blackthorne. Blackthorne is still enjoyable to watch as the urban wizard and I have no doubt he is capable of fulfilling the role as Butcher wrote it, but it seems the director had a different idea of what would play well.

It is a pity the show was cancelled after only a single season. Perhaps the cast could have moved closer to the qualities that make the Dresden Files such good reading.",1395964800,,1024,4.709497206703911

Yes there are disturbing occurrences, yet they're not offensive, they're interesting.  A bit of a twist here and there.  You can't help but care about the characters and how they deal with these odd situations.

2843379,3,B000QUEQ4U,"When it comes to ghost/horror stories I'm a skeptical cynic. It's difficult for me to suspend disbelief for this kind of movie. Especially if the plot (in this case plots) is thin and produced cheaply. With Dresden most of the episodes have plots which make it easier for my jaded eyes to believe. I think the above average quality of the programs can be attributed to the actors and actresses involved. Paul Blackthorne's performances have a sincere tone to them. He seems to really believe in the series. The dialogue in all the episodes are spiced with sexual innuendo that adds interest to the plots lines. This is particularly true in the program titled ""Bad Blood"". Joanne Kelly makes her performance as Bianca in this installment sizzling. She is such an astonishingly beautiful woman that I think Blackthorne is nearly consumed. The chemistry between them is palpable. The series certainly won't win any Oscars but for pure escapism, overall the series is worth a watch, even for this tired old observer.",1395705600,,1012,4.923976608187134

2843384,5,B000QUEQ4U,We really enjoyed Dresden Files Season 1.  Wish they were having more seasons.  We would enjoy seeing more of this show.,1395360000,,120,4.666666666666667
2843385,5,B000QUEQ4U,Loved the story and the actors I'm a very big fan of the books. Wish there were more series on DVD,1395360000,,98,3.7142857142857144
2843386,4,B000QUEQ4U,Fun and easy to watch. A good escape from the Days BS. To bad it only got one season I really would have liked to watch more.,1395273600,,125,3.6666666666666665

2843418,3,B000QUEQ4U,"I liked the Dresden book series and was excited when I noticed the movies among the Amazon titles.  And if you can get past picking out the differences between the book character and the movie one then you may just enjoy watching them.  I have to admit it is kind of hard sometimes, I mean I can easily see the hockey stick or drum stick for the walking staff (I guess), but when Harry has Bianca a Red Court as a love interest...well...that I had to take with a big grain of salt.  if your not familiar with the books, you will not notice these things and will probably really like them for the witty humor they are.",1395187200,,617,4.211864406779661
2843419,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Another series that probably deserved another season to work out the wrinkles most TV series go through.  The characters are likable enough though a bit inconsistent regarding past and present connections.  I'd recommend this as good, fun entertainment.",1395100800,,253,5.631578947368421
2843420,4,B000QUEQ4U,Overall a good show. I like Paul Blackthorne as Harry Dresden and Terrence Mann as Bob.  The show diverged from the books a bit and I can understand the compromise.  A good whodunit with magic thrown in.,1395100800,,203,4.45945945945946
2843421,5,B000QUEQ4U,I enjoyed reading the Dresden Files books.  The movies are as close to the books as I have ever seen.,1395014400,,101,4.05

2843423,5,B000QUEQ4U,Stayed tuned in through the season.  It's a good Sci-Fi series for the entire family.  It's a shame that such a quality series doesn't make it in the  USA.,1395014400,,155,4.275862068965517
2843424,4,B000QUEQ4U,I enjoyed watching the TV Series. The only negative as a fan of the books is that the characters do not quite match the way they are described in the books. The story lines could easily come from Harry's world and I enjoyed them. It is too bad this did not keep going!,1395014400,,268,4.0754716981132075
2843425,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Just a great series, not as good as the books, but enjoyed the series, was greatly appreciated, would love to see more of that genre.  Might call it wholesome magic.",1394928000,,165,4.5
2843426,5,B000QUEQ4U,Good program but was canceled before it really caught on.  ( a lot like Firefly  a good show except they never made the movie for Dresden files),1394928000,,144,4.296296296296297
2843427,4,B000QUEQ4U,Wish there were more seasons. I believe these characters and the story arc had a lot of juice. Paul Blackstone made a great Dresden.,1394928000,,132,4.541666666666667
2843448,3,B000QUEQ4U,It is fun to watch but something that is audience specific in appeal.  Some drama thrown in and a good way to escape for an hour if you are into this sci-fi type of show.,1394841600,,170,3.857142857142857
2843449,5,B000QUEQ4U,"This show was my first taste of the Dresden Files books. I love the books and love the show. I was so disappointed when they discontinued it. Casting was perfect, stories different from the books, but still wonderful and intriguing.",1394755200,,232,4.825
2843450,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I wish they had never cancelled it. I enjoy the Jim Butcher books very much and I believe this series to stay very close to the intended story line. Other than the fact that the cop should have been blonde and taller, it's perfect. This is the show that made me a Paul Blackthorne fan. Watch the show, read the books, and enjoy magick from a man's perspective.",1394755200,,360,4.3088235294117645
2843451,5,B000QUEQ4U,This would have been an awesome series if they had not canceled it after the first season. So now I just watch season 1 over and over. It never gets boring.,1394755200,,156,4.064516129032258

2843453,2,B000QUEQ4U,"I've read all the books in this series. The production is just sad in comparison. The characters are porely cast, It might not be bad if you never read the books, but I've been disapointed in the three episodes that I watched.",1394668800,,226,4.404761904761905

2843456,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Read the books and love video the series.  I don't mind if it does not follow book, unlike Bitten which loosely following the book, which I don't mind as much as killing off  a beloved character who did not die in the book?????",1394409600,,227,4.255813953488372

2843517,3,B000QUEQ4U,"I like the casting of the main character, and the delving into the story's world is fun, but so far rather token at best. I'd much rather they had taken the story of the books rather than make it a serial show... but it's still fun for fans of Dresden who don't have TOO high expectations of truthfulness to the books. :)",1394236800,,321,4.193548387096774

2843519,3,B000QUEQ4U,"So far i've like them, but i find the books to be much more...intellectually satisfying. The characters portraying the ones from the book seem...different from the ones in the books. Good, but i find the books to be better.",1394236800,,223,4.743589743589744
2843520,4,B000QUEQ4U,I enjoy the series. I think it is better than the one season it survived. The characters are unique and the storyline unusual.,1394236800,,126,4.521739130434782

2843523,4,B000QUEQ4U,"This show was well thought out. The main character is good but wasn't always good. I like the way that he is not the center of every ""bad"" guy's world too.
All in all I liked the characters, good and bad, and the stories were imaginative.",1394064000,,238,4.195652173913044
2843524,5,B000QUEQ4U,The pacing is a little disjointed. The characters needed time to develop. It is a fun watch and good for ideas and a nice adjunct to the books.,1394064000,,143,4.142857142857143

2843553,1,B000QUEQ4U,"I watched one a half episode and that was enough. If you like occult type stuff you may like it, but I don't. I thought it was going to be more scifi. It's no wonder I hadn't even heard of the series.",1393804800,,200,3.7857142857142856
2843554,4,B000QUEQ4U,Quirky cop buddy show.  On the formula of Castle but with the addition of the magic.  I wish it had a few more seasons!,1393804800,,119,3.9166666666666665
2843555,5,B000QUEQ4U,The books are also great. The series morphed Murphy to a brunette with a child. It also doesn't have Michael. It subsitutes Morgan who is not nearly as interesting or fun. Nevertheless this series is better than anything on current TV.,1393718400,,235,4.7560975609756095

2843581,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I came across this by accident - I had never heard of the show nor the books. Harry Dresden is a wizard, and a police consultant (and a bit of a down and out PI). No one seems to understand that Harry is a real (magical) wizard (or that magic is real), but he helps the police solve murders where magic (unknown to police) has been involved. Harry lives with the ghost of a sorcerer named ""Bob"", and he helps Harry to figure out some of the magic.

It's a pretty good show, I would have liked to have seen it continue. I would have liked to have seen more with ""Bob"", but it is entertaining.
My biggest complaint with this DVD is NO SUBTITLES, but it does have closed caption. Unfortunately my new(er) TV does not allow me to watch closed captioned because I do not have cable or satellite. I would need to watch this on my old TV and old DVD player in order to access the closed captioned.

After viewing the TV show, I am interested in reading the books.",1393545600,,956,4.190217391304348

2843621,4,B000QUEQ4U,The episode were very close to the actual book. I would recommend this to all sci-fi fans. The people chosen for the roles make the characters seem more life like than just word in a book,1393027200,,187,4.222222222222222
2843622,4,B000QUEQ4U,If you've read the books then you will like this series. It's entertaining and fun to watch and even though there are some slight differences from the books it still stays true to them. I wish they had kept this series going.,1393027200,,225,4.380952380952381

2843672,4,B000QUEQ4U,"It was really good some parts could have bin better but over all its was a really great show with plots that had unexpected twist to them that kept you wanting to figure it all out before the episode or show revealed it too you.
There was a few corny things tho like his wand was a drum stick and the hooky stick was I think post to be his staff or some thing it was a  little weird but I guess it was post to be to blend in and not be so obvious what it is.

Other then that it was good it mixed old mythical lore creature and magic being with modern society. The shows kinda a Syfy idea of a wizerd male bachelor/ average joe I guess.
One thing is I didn't find him attractive at all but I liked his personality at times and thought he was doing a good job acting wise for the roll he was giving, I just felt cause he wasn't attractive it was weird the show tried to make him come across like hes super hot when he wasn't lol.

That all said I did like this show and would have gladly watched a 2nd season maybe even a third but sadly they only made one season oh well but its still worth it to watch.

Hope if you watch it you injoy it as I did. =)",1392681600,,1151,3.823529411764706

2843682,5,B000QUEQ4U,The episodes are a bit disjointed as noted by other reviewers. But the ideas are fun and the show kept my interest. It was just starting to heat up between Harry and Connie when the series ends. The council and in particular Mie is very interesting and it would have been fun to see how this plays out.

2843797,5,B000QUEQ4U,I just finished reading Jim Butcher's Dresden series (at least what has been written so far!) and was surprised and happy to see that there was an attempt to make it into a series.  I think the stories really lend themselves to TV (or a movie) especially with the renewed interest in this kind of story.  I like the actors for Dresden and Bob.  Murphy was growing on me and she changed a LOT during the book series from start to current.  So maybe that would have worked out too.  Sorry to not get introduced to the other characters that are in later books.  Maybe the powers to be will revisit?,1391040000,,595,4.315315315315315

So many that its fair to say that my standard of appraisal isn't that of those who have the power to give, or take the life of a series.  I like depth of character and I like consistency in the story line.  I love great acting.  I look for credibility and accuracy in details and the overall presentation.  Sci-Fi isn't normally a genre I choose because it usually lacks all those things.  The Dresden Files is a major exception.  It gets the highest marks in every one of my areas of judgement.  Now, with one episode left to watch I'm wondering if I'll ever find another series to equal it.  However, I'm the eternal optimist - I'll keep trying.  As for you, if you haven't seen The Dresden Files, don't miss it.  Then buy the books, both the Kindle and the whispersynced versions - you won't regret it.

2843805,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I caught this show very late on, in fact I believe it was a re-run that I was watching and as the say  the dye had been cast and the powers that be had cancelled. I must concur with other reviewers here that this series had the ingredients to become a real winner. I guess we all seen it before a good series destroyed before it had a chance to succeed such as Star Trek (original series), firefly and  Rubicon  but to mention a few.
The Dresden Files had flora and fauna that consisted of real magic, ghouls, vampires, demons, spirits, werewolves, and other mythical monsters. Our special PI one Harry Dresden works to safeguard the general public who are ignorant, and should be kept ignorant, of magic and the dark forces conspiring against them. This makes it problematic for Harry to get by as a working wizard and private eye (PI). The Chicago PD's Karrin Murphy regularly engages Dresden as a specialist to help unravel cases of a supernatural nature.
Harry Dresdens life is further complicated by the White Council
This institution is the recognized governing body of Wizards, has decreed the Seven Laws of Magic, which all magic operators are anticipated to follow. Breaking any of the laws, even without knowing of them, carries a death penalty bar under very rare and special circumstances. A very good series that was never given a real chance.",1390867200,,1356,4.713080168776371

The author lives in my town and I didn't know about this series, Spike from Buffy the Vampire reads the books in audio and I still didn't know about it, but I caught the series on Sci-Fi and was addicted.  Sadly, it died quickly and is still lamented, but those who love the books will enjoy this series.  Bob needed to be doable on screen and I like what they did, the people don't match the book descriptions but I got past that.  I bought this so I could see it from time to time and hope for a reprieve that will never come.  Hey, Chicago, a Wizard, what else do you need, oh yeah, sarcasm!",1390521600,,677,4.06015037593985
2843828,4,B000QUEQ4U,"the short version is that this is a bullet points version of the general dresdenverse. this is not the books. this really only barely resembles the books most notably and disappointing: no blue beetle, sorry guys. however the show does capture the general tone, if not the pace, of the books. you do get a nuts and bolts version of stormfront, but the rest of the series is relegated to a more side jobs like scheme as a monster of the week kind of setup. also bob is different. yes i know, everyone would like to see a skull with glowing eyes giving the protagonist crap about his sex life, and he still does that so cool it.

that was for the fans. for everyone else it's basically a detective show plus some magic stuff. if you are into that sort of thing give it a watch, if not i would recommend something with more explosions(this is not saying that this show is short on explosions, because it is not). a warning to those seeking a show rife with spell slinging and crazy flashing lights and effects: don't expect that, you will be disappointed. seriously, the main character is a detective, he mostly looks for clues, but with magic. the pacing could be better and the plots could be more engaging, but the show only got one season so it's not like they had the opportunity to do a whole hell of a lot with the world.

give it a shot, it's worth that.",1390521600,,1359,4.346456692913386

2844019,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Storm Front seems like it was written as the pilot, though I haven't looked it up on line. It probably should have been (even without the reference to the first book of the series) because the first episode they chose is just about the worst of the lot, in my opinion. The ""detective helped precocious boy"" thing has been so overdone. But if you can make it past that one, it improves.  We've read all the books through book 14 and were initially put off the show by comparing it to those very different works. But if you consider the limitations of an episodic, character-based TV show, this makes for well-executed escapist entertainment. The Warden characters, however, are very flat. The chemistry between Dresden and Murphy was just starting to build during the last couple of episodes.",1388793600,,791,4.773722627737226

Then I read the books and like so many other literature-to-screen endeavors it became painfully clear. The characters were not quite right, some of them completely wrong, his office and home are unlike anything in the books and key concepts are inconsistent.",1388707200,,599,4.504587155963303

Unfortunatly, the series just didn't do it for me.  The actors did very well.  They didn't look anything like the character's descriptions in the book, but that's not a major issue for me.
The big problem for me was the lack of most of the supporting characters in the book. The books had so much going on.  There were many other characters, both friends and foes.  While Harry was clearly the lead man, he had lots of people who were a part of his life.  The supporting characters added interest and some fun to his life.  In the series, he leads a lonely, dark existence struggling along with only Bob to help him.  Where were Michael & his family, the other Knights of the Cross, Toot-toot and the gang, the Alphas, Ebenezer, his Godmother, his pets, his brother..........

2844077,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Huge Dresden book fan here. There were many things about this TV series they changed from the books but I still really liked this show. I wish it had a chance to grow. There are many potentially good shows that never had a chance to go anywhere because they were cut after their first season (Firefly, Moonlight). It is especially upsetting when I see so much crap on TV that people seem to love. Husband and i recently cut the cable cord and we are happier watching reruns of good shows like this than anything on regular TV.
Anyway, back to this show.. Like I said they made a lot of edits from the books, but this was still entertaining. Going through the character:
Dresden - I like the way he is portrayed. They changed little aesthetic things about him but his essence is there. He drives a jeep instead of the VW, his staff is a drum stick, his coat is wrong but he plays the character well.
Bob - Nothing at all like the book Bob but I like this version of Bob. I think making him a visible being is needed in TV land but the perverted Bob of the books is missed :) this is a good character.
Murphy is a bit annoying, she seemed overly anti-Dresden. but Murphy in the books was not on Team Dresden fully for the first couple books either. She is a good demeanor for Murphy but with brown hair.
Butters - in the show so little didn't really get a chance to make an opinion
Morgan - really like him a lot
Susan - also didn't really see her enough to make a full opinion but she is blond not brunette.

I think as a Dresden fan there were a lot of changes that seemed silly, but as a TV show it was entertaining and would of liked to see more. Plus it had great shots of my hometown Chicago which I loved too. I think the show could of kept itself interesting.",1388188800,,1765,4.145772594752186

2844079,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I liked the series.  At first I thought that Paul Blackthorne was wrong for the role but he grows into it and becomes convincing as the series goes on.  The actress who played Murphy was good and as the series ended she fit the role well.  I like the series and I would buy the second series if they ever come out with one.
A annoyance that caused me to remove a star is that there is a rather disjointed change in the story line at about the 6 or 7th episode.  Characters in the books ""popped"" in for an appearance that we not in the previous episodes.
Overall a good series.  I wish they would create season two.",1388102400,,614,4.126050420168068

2844168,1,B000QUEQ4U,"If you have ever read the books DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW!!!! It is a sad parody of one of my favorite book series.  There is so much wrong with this show, the little things they could have gotten right and didn't is sickening.
1. No trench coat
  The coat he wears is kind of long but a far cry from the collar to floor coat described in the books.
2. No ""Blue"" Beetle
  He drives a crappy Jeep instead of the iconic beetle driven in the books.
3. Murphy is a brunette
  They couldn't even cast the characters appropriately Murphy is BLONDE.
4. Susan is blonde
  As with above Susan is described as a brunette, why couldn't they just switch the actresses?
5. He lives in what looks like an old fire station.
  Was it to hard to find a basement?
6. Ancient Mai looks like she's 20
  There is a reason she is called Ancient Mai, because she's really old
7. Bob is portrayed as an old man
  Instead of a talking skull (which is what makes it so entertaining in the books) Bob manifest as an old man when
  Harry talks to him.
That's just what I can think of off the top of my head.  So if you're a big fan of the books and think it would be great to see them brought to life, this series will be very disappointing for you as it was for me.",1386633600,4,1235,4.012345679012346

Detective show with a touch of paranormal.  Great premise and totally different from all the other TV shows.  Where can I get one of those awesome hockey sticks?",1386460800,,427,4.702702702702703
2844171,4,B000QUEQ4U,I enjoyed Dresden Files.  It does stray from the source a little but it is still a pretty good show.  I wish it had lasted longer.  The books are a create way to pass the time if you like the show.,1386460800,,197,3.7560975609756095
2844172,5,B000QUEQ4U,"It is a shame they only had one season. I have really enjoyed this series, very entertaining and great stories!",1386374400,,111,4.6
2844173,2,B000QUEQ4U,"This Isn't the Dresden Files. As a show unrelated to the books I'd give the first episode 3 or 4 stars. The problem though is they called it the Dresden Files and it appears that they didn't even attempt to cast the characters, build a set, create dialogue or convey the essence of the character based on Mr. Butcher's work.

  The actors may have been capable of pulling off some of their roles but they were not given the tools to succeed. Except Murphy. The actor cast cannot pull off Murphy. Murphy is the most egregious mis-cast. Murphy's personality revolves around ""Tiny but fierce"" and her struggle to be recognized as someone with gravitas. The poor actress assigned to play Murphy, a 5' tall blond 100 pound Irish character, is played by a 5'8"" dark haired Latina. Maybe Holly Hunter wasn't available or too expensive but there must be a couple short pretty blond actresses looking for work. I didn't watch after episode one but if the producers retained the guy in charge of casting I expect to see Mouse played by a Boxer or maybe a hyper Greyhound.
  Taking Bob out of the skull and having an actor play him is, in my opinion, a forgivable use of poetic license. The task of putting The Dresden Files into a 40 minute bottle should be herculean and some things just cannot be put in.  Sadly no Heracles was available, nor was anyone who read the series and invested some emotion in to who the characters are.
  I've read some reviews, many people (who profess to not having read the books first) are very pleased by the synergy the actors realize as the production progresses. This series appears to be at least good as a stand alone story, If you haven't read the books watch a couple shows, I believe you'll like them.
  If you have read the books and ""got into"" the characters you will spend the first 30 minutes bewildered by the choices made by the executives involved in this shows creation. I am usually quite good at suspending my disbelief and just going with the flow of a movie. I just couldn't do it for this one. Maybe if I try again it won't be as jarring and I could better appreciate the story. Maybe you are better than me at suspending your disbelief, I hope so, the T.V. show ""The Dresden Files"" seems to be well made, acted and directed.

TLDR: If you read the books, you'll pay closer attention to all the needless discrepancies from the books Jim Butcher created than the story on the screen.  If you have not read the books, enjoy the show, it ain't bad.

2 stars, when you enthusiastically open a box labeled ""Chocolate"" and you find it filled with an assortment of really nice cheeses you cannot honestly say the item you opened meet your expectations.

2844208,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Pretty good show, plots are pretty original though the hints you get about the magical world that Dresden refuses to associate with aren't real consistent or clear. Guess it makes writing the show easier because you can just stick in whatever sounds cool then give a half a**ed explanation for it, but for me it's kind of a cop out way to do it. Still better than most of the garbage on tv now though.",1385942400,,401,4.36

1. Good acting in overall (at least for the key characters)
2. Good directing
3. Good story (I just knew about the books recently!..didn't read the book yet!)
4. Fair CGI effects
5. Great makeup effects.

This season tend to go well for the first few episodes until I reached almost the middle it got worse (episodes 5-8) and then got better. The least episode I liked is number 8. My most liked episodes are 10 and 11. Favoring the episodes mostly rely on story telling order and techniques chosen to go over events.

In Overall:
You may like the show if you like fantasy world in real life. It might go in the same category as ""charmed"" and ""Angle"" with little bit of ""Mentalist"".",1384646400,,737,4.404411764705882

This series ran for just one season on SyFy.  With a couple of exceptions, the series does NOT try to use the storylines from the books.  The original stories are mostly fairly good.

I only gave it 4 stars because of some of the things left out.  Harry's Fairy Godmother is entirely missing in the series.  His girlfriend only appears in one episode.  His conflict with modern electronics is presented as ""at will"", rather than constant.  Jeep rather than the VW Bug is no problem, except there is no explanation as to why the old vehicle.  The Chicago PD and Murphy are less ""enlightened"" to magic than in the books.

I wish that the producer who did the Desden Files would continue doing the series.

2844322,5,B000QUEQ4U,"The Dresden Files is an interesting character driven series about Harry Dresden; a wizard by trade in modern day Chicago.  Harry is a very likeable character that has a journeyman's skill in sorcery.  He is rather competent in his field but is not especially powerful nor high up in the hierarchy of sorcerers.  He makes his living by being a wizard for hire much like a private detective.  He finds lost objects or people and somehow gets entangled in the machinations of the guild that governs the sorcerers and wizards of which he is a small cog.  Harry also consults for Detective Murphy of the Chicago Police Department.  Kind of like a consulting wizard in the same vein of Sherlock Holmes being a consulting detective.

If you are expecting great and numerous special effects of spectacular battles with bolts of power flying about, then this series is not for you.  If however, you want a series about a very likeable guy who happens to be a low key wizard and all of the predicaments that a fairly normal guy would get into, then this is the series for you.  I must warn you though that getting attached to Harry is not going to end well since there is only one season of The Dresden Files.  Sadly, it was cancelled.

This series is available on Amazon video and on DVD.",1382140800,,1279,4.541484716157205
2844323,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Firstly, this is not the book series. It was not intended to be so and is instead supposed to be a completely different world featuring the same characters in a similar universe. The author of the novels has stated this outright.

With that clarification made, I think this show rocks. It is witty, well scripted, and full of intelligent action (vs mindless violence). The show, much like the book, reaches for and obtains the perfect balance between the gritty PI theme of noir and the SciFi/Fantasy universe.

A friend summarizes it as ""Buffy for grown men"". I'd say that's a fair synopsis, and also the reason it failed to go past season 1.

Much like Firefly, this show would succeed in the nerdier world of today.",1382054400,,718,4.682539682539683

I really enjoy the characters, the plot line, and so on. But I do feel that the show was rushed. As in, packing in too much action before the audience has even decided if they care about the character yet. That's why I took down a star. If I don't care about any of the characters, I don't have an attachment to the show and will eventually stop watching out of boredom. Which is sad because the universe they paint is complex, mysterious, and interesting. So certainly worth watching, but be ready for more breadth instead of depth.",1380240000,,659,4.409836065573771

2844396,2,B000QUEQ4U,"I'm an avid fan of The Dresden Files.  I have read the books a thousands times, and I'm so addicted to the series, I find myself feining for the new releases!  That said, when I found this series online, I was STOKED!  That is, until I watched the first episode.

The show has absolutely nothing to do with The Dresden Files where it gets its name.  Sure, the character names are the same and they share some of the character's histories, but beyond those similarities is a show that the director decided to take his own wild liberties.  Enemies are lovers, long dead characters are alive and well, and some important characters just plain don't exist.

You'll have to believe me when I tell you I wanted nothing more than this show to be awesome.  I went in with an open mind and walked away with a sour taste.  If you haven't read the series, maybe you'll enjoy this mediocre sci-fi channel production, but anyone know knows Harry for who he is won't be able to stand it.",1379980800,,973,4.421348314606742

2844429,5,B000QUEQ4U,I really liked this series.  I've read all of the Dresden files books and found this to be an accurate presentation of the tone of the books though the sequence and events are a little muddled.

2844430,5,B000QUEQ4U,"While not adhering to the book series completely, this Sci Fi series on Harry Dresden hits pretty close to the mark.

And there are a few glaring errors in the show (Murphy is the blonde in the books and Susan is the brunette, Harry carries a real staff not a hockey stick, and some of the names have been changed, not to mention that in the books Bob is not a ghost) yet I still enjoy the stories and once I had seen the shows, I always hear Paul Blackthorne when Harry is narrating in the books.

2844483,3,B000QUEQ4U,It's an Okay show.  If you are a fan of the books then this will disappoint.  They have taken away many wonderful aspects of that world and tried to fit it into a world the masses may enjoy too.  Big mistake.  It is OK because there were so few good Scify shows at the time that at least they tried.  Not a good try but they tried.,1378512000,,331,3.8805970149253732

2844485,2,B000QUEQ4U,"I'm a fan of the books.  Maybe that's the problem - the show implemented a whole slew of changes for no apparent reason, e.g., Karrin Murphy is now Connie and is brown-eyed brown haired woman instead of blue eyed blonde, there is no subbasement laboratory in Dresden's apartment, there's no cat, Harry drives a Jeep not the Blue Beetle.  In other words, some comfortable atmosphere of familiarity is just gone.  First couple of episodes provide for very little character development.  Spoiler alert: Harry tackles a skinwalker, the creature so scary it nearly rendered him catatonic in the books in the very first episode without much effort.  In other words, the show deviates from the atmosphere in the books way to much and the stories are relatively forgettable.  I'm not impressed.",1378425600,2,786,5.007692307692308

If you are going to make a series that doesn't relate to the series then just call it a different name. had this taken place in the same world but not been Dresden it might have been born. but what they did to the characters, their relationships and how they buntched the back story =_= just not worth watching. might have liked it if i watched it first",1378339200,7,439,4.176470588235294

  I think the cast has done a good job so far, I'm loving Paul Blackthorne as Dresden and when I read the books (I'm still working through the series in my spare time) I actually read it in his voice.  Blackthorne really fits the picture I made of Dresden in my mind.  I also really like Terrence Mann as Bob.  I think he was able to really bring the character to life from the skull that he normally is in the series.

2844593,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I like the supernatural stories and Dresden being a wizard. Although most of the shows are done by special effects, they are pretty good. I also like the humor as Dresden, but the woman detective Murphy does nothing for the show. She is not really attractive and recites her lines pretty mundane. Bob, the ghost sorcerer is very good. All in all if you like the supernatural the Dresden files are for you",1376179200,,404,4.5479452054794525
2844594,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Its not exactly 'true' to the books, but its a good adaptation.  Really liked the hockey stick staff / drumstick wand idea for a 'modern' wizard.",1376092800,,145,4.576923076923077

2844635,4,B000QUEQ4U,"TV turns every good story to TV MUSH.  This one is a little better, though.  This show may not satisfy the followers of Harry Dresden, but as TV shows go, it is a fun watch.
  I find it interesting that Nicolas Cage is one of the producers.  This takes place BEFORE The Sorcerer's Apprentice.  The Disney movie's character's personality,  Dress, and presentation of special effects is right out of a Jim Butcher Book.
  I liked the TV show, which explains why it was canceled after one season.
  If this show is interesting to you at all, you owe it to yourself and pick up one of Jim Butcher's Dresden books.  They are wonderful, especially the audio books.",1375660800,,658,4.52991452991453

2844637,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I've never read the books so I had no preconception of this show prior to watching it.  I do enjoy stories about magic so one bored sunday afternoon, I started watching the show and I was very entertained.  The stories are very interesting and the show does a good job of keeping a good pace and still make sure we develop a good understanding of the main character.  David Carson does a very good job of fulfilling the role.  I knew Carson from Arrow on CW and didn't think much of his acting abilities on Arrow but he does a much better job on Dresden.  There are a lot of story arcs in the show so I'm very disappointed that it only got one season.  I can partly understand why it didn't do well because of the order in which the show was presented.  One of the other reviews lists the proper order vs televised.  I would highly recommend watching it in the proper order.  But be forewarned, the pilot quality is incredibly bad.  But once you get through that, you are rewarded with interesting stories and characters that are highly entertaining.",1375574400,,1050,4.421875

2844640,4,B000QUEQ4U,Recently watched this one & only season  of The Dresden Files on Amazon Prime & really enjoyed it.  I later read the show aired & was cancelled by The Sci-fi channel after one season. What a shame considering the dreck they  air now. I 'm a sucker for good fantasy with well-developed/acted characters we grow to care for. Add a touch of humor and you got me hooked. Sorry we didn't get to see more of Harry & Bob the Ghost at work!,1375574400,,432,4.180722891566265
2844641,4,B000QUEQ4U,Mr. Blackthorn does a very good job portraying a man with special abilities who is trying to fit in with the rest of society while still maintaining his individuality. The episodes are interesting but not overly complex. A good watch for sci-fi or fantasy fans without the need to be singly occupied by the video.,1375574400,,313,4.709090909090909

2844643,2,B000QUEQ4U,"I really don't get too picky about adaptation details when going from book to movie.  But this series just completely ignores some details that Butcher would stress in each and every one of his books (I've read all of them).

That old Volkswagen beetle was in nearly every single book at least a dozen times.  It was not an unimportant detail.  Bob is a wimp?  What the heck is up with that.  Bob was a crass pervert.  Not some wimpy Grandfather.  Bad choice.  Karen was a blond.  Dresden mentioned it every time he saw her.

And the real deal breaker was the apartment.  Dresden lived in a crappy basement apartment with old 2nd hand furniture and NO ELECTRICITY.  Bob lived in a dingy dusty sub-basement where his lab was.  Not some artsy Manhattan style apartment.  Very bad",1375401600,,777,4.569343065693431

That said, I found the show ok, though I'm pretty sure I'm biased from the books.  Don't expect anything riveting, but it's definitely fun to see the characters put on screen (even if they're not entirely accurate).  I have to agree with the other reviews and say that my favorite character in the show was Bob (AKA, the skull).  I had wondered how the show was going to go about portraying Bob and I have to say that the way they did it was very well done.",1375315200,,610,4.170940170940171

2844670,3,B000QUEQ4U,"The only thing keeping the Dresden Files from getting a 4 or 5 star review is that 4 out the twelve episodes are actually pretty weak offerings. Viewing the series in order, it is quite disjointed. The remaining episodes are actually quite good and I really enjoyed the character of Bob. The fact is that the one or two episodes he is absent from are by far among the least entertaining in my opinion. There were several good characters, and I can see why so many lamented the show's cancellation. There was a ton of material to mine. It did make me check out the novels the series is based on and they are promisingly fun so far. If you have a handful of afternoons to waste 45 minutes on, this show may not be the best way to spend that time, but you have decent odds of being entertained.",1374969600,,791,4.28
2844671,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I do enjoy the stories of Harry Dresden, a modern ""wizard"" in Chicago. It was axed by Lionsgate and SyFy way too soon. Reminds me of the debacle of Firefly by Fox.

2844676,5,B000QUEQ4U,"In keeping with the stupidity of the network name change, SYFY cancelled this show just when it hit its stride.  With the large number of books, there was fertile ground to continue.  I guess the ratings didn't warrant a second season, but 1 season seems awful quick to pull the plug.

A good watch for fans of the books.  Even the casual fan might get into it, but the knowledge of such a small number of episodes hurts the chances of grabbing a casual fan.",1374624000,,458,4.352941176470588

2844698,3,B000QUEQ4U,"Spoiler Alert:
If you've not read the books, I think this is probably an entertaining enough show--I certainly watched the whole thing anyway--but if you're a fan of the books, this show is only loosely based on them, and in my opinion, cuts a lot of what is great about the books. Harry's office/apartment is all wrong. There's no Mister, no Blue Beetle, no duster. Susan, Morgan and, most notably Murphy, are all significantly different from the characters in the book. They turn Morningstar into his uncle and change that whole familiar story around. Heck, they even change it so the shield bracelet belonged to his mother, rather than his necklace. I was quite disappointed, too, because most of there changes felt arbitrary to me. Oh, and the stories within each episode don't follow the books AND the use of magic and the rules of how magic works are all messed up.

It is based on the books by Jim Butcher and remains somewhat true to the spirit and intent of the books. What is not immediately apparent is the political intrigue going on with the world of wizards and the High Council, although some of the later episodes start to refer to it. Possibly because these are 1-hour TV episodes and they want to wrap up the story in that time frame it is difficult to to develop the nuances of intrigue. I think that this is probably why the series wasn't renewed for more seasons. The episodes they did shoot were mostly formulaic and predictable. I enjoyed the series because I enjoyed the books. I am not sure if I had seen the series first that I would have bothered with the books.

However, I stumbled upon it on amazon prime's streaming service, I thought I would give it a shot.
  Why the hockey stick?  What the drum stick?  Why an old army jeep?  Why a loft with a migical hidden lab?  Why make Murphy a complete noob by failing to cover her experience in Special Investigations?  Dresden bangs Bianca?  And why the convoluted crap with his uncle?  They took a perfectly entertaining narrative and added what they thought people would want.  He doesn't have a wand?  Well, Harry Potter has a wand, so we'll give him a drum stick.  He has an old beat up VW Beetle?  Well, we'll give him an old beat up army jeep.  The only thing I liked was what they did with Bob, that was neat.

2844814,2,B000QUEQ4U,"Watching the Dresden Files TV series is like showing up to a neighborhood BBQ to discover that everyone else is a vegan and all the food made of tofu, sprouts, and yogurt.

The scriptwriters and producer apparently went out of their way to ensure that everything desirable about the Dresden Files as written by Jim Butcher was edited out and replaced with pap. Rather than the wise-cracking, edgy wizard detective of the novels, Nic Cage's team turned Harry Dresden into a SNAG -- a Sensitive New Age Guy -- lacking in nerve, verve, personal courage, or any of the daring recklessness of the novel. And just to make sure that the point was hammered home -- that this is NOT the Harry Dresden of the novels, they replaced every visual signature piece that goes with Harry, and inserted a bunch of flaccid, ineffective, cutsie kitsch. Thus the blasting rod is now a drumstick, the staff is a hockey stick, the black duster is now a Hoodie jacket, and the Blue Beetle a Willys jeep.

Beyond that, the producers were so deficient in vision that they attempted to make more or less each novel into a single 40 minute episode (allowing time for commercials). The Dresden Files novels are perfect material for a more ambitions series along the lines of ""24,"" in which each novel becomes the theme for half a year of programming.

In the end, the Dresden Files TV series is trash. It's not worth the price of entry. The project, which could have been a stellar televsions success, was bled to death by talentless hacks. And the truly appalling thing is that the fools who set forth this piece of rubbish still own the screen rights, so no reasonably decent version will be forthcoming.",1370131200,2,1677,4.658783783783784

2844834,5,B000QUEQ4U,"If you insist the books are the only iteration version of this concept, if you insist all TV should have the production budget and production values of major motion pictures, and if the book versions of the characters that you have visualized in your head are the only acceptable realizations, then this series isn't for you.

On the other hand if you can relax and accept someone else's interpretation of this concept, if you can understand the need to create a new character for exposition in a television version of a book, and if you can be patient and allow some subtle development, you might be able to enjoy this television show.

It's not great and the lack of budget shows here and there. But I do enjoy some light diversion once in a while and this show isn't terrible at that. To compare it to the books is going to lead to frustration in most devoted fans. On the other hand, what movie or TV show can come close to the depth, structure, and complexity of the book on which it's based. If you are a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, the movies are pretty lame and never come close to the experience of reading...and they cost millions and millions per movie. So, here we have Mr. Butler's stories mashed together and realized in a budget SyFy show. It's not perfect and it's not the best show ever, but it's at least it's fun and a decent diversion.

On specific characters-- I applaud the use of Bob as a confidant who is constantly serving in an expository manner to help move the story along. The actor playing him is funny and this Bob adds a way to show Harry's conscience that we read about in his head in the books.

I also applaud the new version of Morgan. In the books he is a stupid jerk who never seems to get any development. So to tighten up that aspect of the stories, Morgan is allowed to be intelligent and grow and appreciate Harry sometimes.

I realize if you read the books, loved the books, and can't accept any other version of any of the characters or plot lines, then you're going to be annoyed by this TV version. I read the books, and like them. I watch the show and like it.

Maybe someday the books will explode in popularity and then warrant a 200 million dollar movie--I hope so. Until then, this TV show is not a bad alternative for spending some time with Harry and pals.",1369612800,,2317,4.364269141531323

While several series have tried to capitalize on the wizard/witch/warlock theme, they have either been comedies that were hard to take seriously or poorly conceived series that were hard to take seriously.

Paul Blackthorne competently plays the complicated, tortured, but redemptively-minded Dresden who uses his gifts to help the local PD.  The police office he helps turns out to be his one true friend, in addition to his ghostly ""roommate.""  Shows that investigated his past gave us further insight into this mufti-faceted character and I left the series wanting to know more.  The plots were believable enough to be engaging without being too complicated, even though there was often some sub plot underneath that was not completely revealed.

There are some significant differences from what Mr. Butcher wrote.  However, taken on its own, the tv series isn't bad at all.

In the books, Dresden gets beaten up a lot.  He staggers from one desperate emergency to the next, increasingly battered.  The tv shows are a lot less hard on the main character, and not as thrilling, but still each episode is a well-told little story.",1368403200,,664,4.39344262295082

2844909,2,B000QUEQ4U,"Okay, based on some of the reviews I made myself watch all of this deservedly-cancelled, season of Dresden Files.

Why didn't it work?  First, it's trying to be a Charmed version of the popular Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer, only you don't know the Hammer angle until several episodes in, when the sexy-whisper (somewhat) witty voiceovers begin each episode.  That's a nice way to begin an episode, so why didn't they do it consistently?  Why didn't they take the third-to-the-last episode, and begin there?

You coulda done the Greek drama thingy with that episode, making it begin the series; and from its voiceover beginning introducing Morgan et al., go back to what was MorningWay family, why important -- play on Morning Star, Satan's name pre-fall, since a star lights the way, cute -- then who the High Council was, etc.  So by the time you go full circle back to the present as all good Greek drama does, the viewer can say 'aha!' as the 'now' portion of the story (Moi and Morgan) unfolds.  Thus the viewer has an appreciation for the root characters.  You'd have to insert some flashbacks for establishing Murphy, but that's okay.  So at this point, that one episode is maybe 90 minutes, so becomes three episodes, establishing the series for the audience, getting them invested in the characters.

THEN you could have started what is here called 'Episode 1', renamed 4.  The reader is clued in.  He now understands, and the wash rinse repeat part of each episode with ever more magic repeating as he's seen too many times, won't be boring.

No, thoughtful introduction of the characters and style so you can IDENTIFY and CARE ABOUT the characters, wasn't desired.  After all, the lame Charmed series didn't bother to make you like the characters, but gave them wooden lines and script, so why not imitate that, in Dresden?

Just hit on the magic over and over, always solving some case usually with someone out to get Dresden, wash rinse repeat.  That too, was the Charmed mantra.  And since Charmed kept on running, the mantra was wrongly assumed to be successful.

Except, here the scripting and plotlines are not for teenyboppers.  Charmed only appeals to the not-quite adult set.  So to take the same wooden lines and then put them in a gritty Hammer context, just makes everything contrived.

Now if A-flight actors were used, maybe the bad script could be overcome.  A Stellan Skaarsgard or even Nicholas Cage (who produced Dresden) might be able to pull off those lines, because someone of their caliber, is more important than the lines said.  We just like watching them act.  The teenyboppers just like the three lead girls in Charmed, so their wooden lines and plots and shallowness, all don't matter.

But when you use lesser actors (not less in talent, but lower in recognition), then you had better make the script and storylines, A-level.  Alas, that doesn't happen here.  Instead, some dingdong imposed the same finish-story-in-one-episode rule that Warner imposed on Angel and Buffy, effectively killing both series.

FOR IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS YOU WILL PAY ATTENTION TO LONG PLOTS.  And, you want them.  Just as in real life.  A short story can still be told on a lower level, but you need hanging threads to keep the audience coming back.  And they won't come back, if not invested in the characters.

But the actors don't have the material to MAKE you become invested in the characters, if a) the script stinks, and b) there is no ongoing story line with lots of twists and added info per episode.  Buffy and Angel succeeded in large measure, not simply due to the chemistry between the lead characters (budding love story being always the long-term plot), but due to all the cast's stories, and you CARE about all the cast.  Many plots and subplots, many things to learn each episode, so you keep coming back.  Same, for Smallville and every other series.  Why do you think daytime soaps have such a loyal following?

But did the script writer learn anything from the successful series which had been out ever since Bewitched (that followed the same complex ongoing plot rules)?  NO.  So what did the actors have to work with?  Flat dialogue, no character introduction and development, stereotypes, and wooden lines.  No backup long story except the all-too-predictable budding romance between Dresden and Murphy.  Who were forced to play two-dimensional stereotypes.  Since he's like Don Jones and she's like Stephanie Zimbalist, we weren't wholly disinterested.  But that's not enough, to be 'like', when you have no good storyline and no witty script to carry even one episode, to term.

Direction and film editing are okay.  But you know:  the point of a series is to tell a LONG story, not wash rinse repeat.  The real story in a series is the long one, with each wash rinse repeat serving as a foil to unveil the pieces in the long story.  Just as in real life:  today you do the wash, tomorrow you go shopping, but what you LEARN each day is the real story of your life.

We learn from Dresden, that the writer needs to be fired or given a long rehab in basic storytelling.  Or else, the producers need to revisit their intentions, versus execution.  And try again.

This could have been a good series.  It can be, again.  REDO IT, please.",1367971200,,5286,4.772626931567329

The special effects were not overly showy, but got the point across. Some of the creatures were eew, like the amorous slug thing. Paul Blackthorne made a very sympathetic downbeat hero. Sensitive, a little clumsy, but neversaydie. The episodes bear re-watching, but I've never seen any re-run on tv. I liked the blend of the character, Harry Dresden as a ""real"" wizard with his father's sleight of hand type of magic. I wanted to know more. The sidekick, the spirit in the skull was also sympthetic even though he had been e-vile in life. The straight-man, the lady cop was played well, as an anchor to the stories. It follows a slightly similar pattern to ""Forever Knight"", maybe ""Moonlight"" and later ""Castle"".

Also, like I've seen with other book to screen translations many of the back story facts had changed. In the books Harry Dresden was an orphan who didn't start to understand or use his powers until he was in his early to mid-teens. His mentor was a wizard who was rather cruel. On the TV show he was raise by his father, he was under ten and had a rather firm grasp of how his powers worked and they hint at a mean uncle who helped develop his powers.

As I said before, I remember the show being interesting, but not something that could really hold my interest long term.  That is why I said that it is only OK.

I know that there are a number of fans of the books who were very displeased because the TV series had significant differences from the books.  I'm really not put off by that.

I enjoyed the show.  I thought it was well acted and directed.  In some ways, I find SyFy's current hit series Lost Girl, to be rather similar. In some respects it also reminds me of much older series Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  I wish there could have been a couple more seasons of the Dresden Files.",1361404800,,752,4.246478873239437

Then I ordered the 15 part series of the books and read them in order. I sent one to my sister and she is working her way thru the series now. They are suspenseful, sometimes humorous and often scary. I see there is a new one in hardback. Jim Butcher, the author is a master if designing characters many of whom are in most of the kindle books.

My sister is coming to visit me from out of town. So I purchased the first tv season to watch immediately online. Looks great on my 17"" Mac Pro screen. So we will be watching it when she comes. Hope you enjoy the series as much as I have",1361145600,,752,3.9473684210526314

However, I really enjoyed Dresden. Dresden is a wizard and tries to help individuals who may be normal or something else like a vampire, ghost, etc. There are flashbacks to his childhood, a love interest, forces who want him dead and other mysteries that make it interesting.",1360627200,,435,4.723684210526316

And they would have played the episodes in order. Did the Fox scheduling team get subcontracted by SyFy? The actors were good, the writing improved stupendously through the series and the changes they made from the book didn't suck. Highly recommend it.",1360540800,,413,4.75
2845086,5,B000QUEQ4U,"The Dresden Files was a series on the upswing when it met its untimely fate.  While not completely faithful to the books, it had its own life, quirkiness and mythos.  The series starts a bit slow but with mild exceptions grows with each episode.  Ironically what I consider the worst episode is the one that most directly follows one of the books.

The characters are well defined and flesh out more as the series progresses.  The character of Bob is one area where the TV show might be even better than the book's rendition.  Terrance Mann does a great job of 'fleshing' out the spirit that lives in a skull.

And for you Warehouse 13 fans, Joanne Kelly makes a few very intriguing guest appearances as the vampire Bianca.

This series isn't quite as good as Firefly but I include it in my short list of excellent series who died an unnecessary early death - I'd love to see this return.",1360540800,,888,4.472049689440993

2845099,3,B000QUEQ4U,"It's not great and, compared to the books, it's disappointing in several ways. It's great on one hand that you can see Dresden live and the actor does an interesting job with his portrayal. Where my taste diverges from what the show delivers is in their choice with many of the supporting characters, but that might be more because of how I imagined them in my head. The ""new Bob"" is neat, and probably more relatable as a ghost than a possessed, perverted skull and even Murphy does an OK job - though I like the tougher, shorter, feistier Murphy from the book. But I guess what really bothered me is it seems like the producers thought it would be best to capitalize on Charmed, the two shows have so many similarities that you could easily pick up one and drop it in the other. In the books, Dresden is dealing nearly constantly with the Nevernever or something from it, demons, angels, or just other nasties - these are here in Dresden but they're cloaked in normal (budget-friendly?) looking people (more disappointing in Birds of a Feather and Storm Front than the others where the antagonists were a Naagloshi shape shifting nightmare monster and a huge, terrifying demon (at least in the books) but they're presented in the show as a woman and a tall bald dude).

In short, if you liked Charmed, and want to see their world told through the eyes of a sarcastic wizard... this is your show.",1360454400,,1397,4.565737051792829
2845100,5,B000QUEQ4U,"im guessing if you saw the show first youll like it best, if you read the books first youll like them better... anyway, both deal with harry dresden, a wizard that advertises in the yellow pages (but halfway denies what he is to avoid dealing with critics and weirdos). He actually works mostly as a detective and the books/video kind of have the feeling of old fashion detective novels as well as presenting the attitude of: ""sucks to be me"".  the difference is that the books go more and more over the top, adding more and more supernatural characters, final battles that last 3-4 chapters, and so on. the tv show keeps it a little more real (although with less time and a smaller budget you have to). in the show he wears an old jacket and occasionally carries his old hockey stick (in the books he wears a duster and carries a magic staff). in the show the magic use is minor, bob the ghost adds humor and emotion, and one supernatural event happens at a time (in the book fireballs may be flying, dinosaurs running down the streets throwing off ghosts, etc... and bob is a spirit animating a talking skull). anyway, the show itself is good, it has drama, it has funny parts, it has the supernatural without a cast of teeneagers who use too much hairgel.",1360454400,,1258,4.469565217391304
2845101,2,B000QUEQ4U,"Because I am a great fan of the supernatural, I bought this series, only to discover that it didn't really start until about episode three, by which time  the proverbial Sword of Damacles had probably already fallen over it.  What the hell viewer would stick around long enough to watch a series grow legs, especially if he was already familiar with the much better crafted bops by Jim Butcher?

Harry is a born and well-trained wizard (the latter only hinted at in the series) who assists the Chicago Police department on cases that smack of the unexplainable, while also grabbing private detective-type cases involving magic.  Based on the immensely successful series of novels by Mr. Butcher, whoever designed this series did an absolutely terrible job.  The viewer will never get to know Harry well enough to care whether or not he is gobbled up by demons; the structure of the series wanders all over the globe without any sense of style; Harry is played as an awkward, largely incompetent nincompoop who only occasionally seems to know what the hell to do with his magic.

When the episodes are good, they're very good; these, coincidentally or not, do not seem to be the stories written by the series' producers.  They intrigued me enough to purchase the first book of the series, and I really enjoyed it, thus ordered the rest.  So where did the translation from novel to television go wrong?  Answer:  everywhere.

Paul Blackthorne gives a credible performance, although to me, he wasn't attractive enough for me to love him just because he got the job.  The supporting cast is all good, although I will never understand why networks and producers alter characters for no good reason.  Murph plays great as a non-blond, tough-edged policewoman; Bob is great as a handsome and not-quite-so-lecherous ghost who regularly escapes the skull that has entrapped him for millennia; Morgan the Harry-hitman for the Magical Council is interesting as an African American.  But why did these characters have to vary so much from the book?  Couldn't you producers honor the original designs that you bought to begin with?  Is this purely an ego trip?  Why don't you adapt the Bible, and change everybody in it to dancing monkeys (actually, that might be an improvement)?

In fairness, by the time the series ended, in addition to wishing it had been better, I was sorry I'd never see more.  That's why I'm reading the books.",1360454400,,2421,4.875305623471883

The actors chosen were absolutely not suited to the roles and Bob? Really, why did they think that making him visible to everyone who saw him was a good idea? This could have been a very good series, if the powers that be had not made a joke of it. The last two episodes were the best, but they still made Harry a weak, pathetic representative of the actual character. Oh, and his house/office combo was a joke...Why can't screenwriters leave well enuogh alone instead of taking an author's long thought out work and literally re-writing it.

2845168,5,B000QUEQ4U,"This series was a wonderful surprise when I first viewed its episodes on Netflix. Shortly thereafter, I bought the DVDs of the first (and, sadly, the only) season on Amazon. The casting of Harry's and Murphy's characters was inspired; Paul Blackthorne is a genuinely likable Harry, and Valerie Cruz is a fresh rendition of the gutsy-yet-vulnerably human police inspector. The special effects were well-balanced between vivid imagery and believability, not overdone or unduly burdened with ""production values"" as is so often the case with this video genre. The decision on the part of the tele-playwrites to diverge from the book series' plot lines was a wise move and didn't violate the spirit of the original characters' portrayals in the print series.

I must confess that I only read the Harry Dresden books AFTER viewing the TV series on Netflix. THAT may account for my disappointment with the print version, which I found to be long-winded and over-written, given the time span of the plot lines and the short arc of the action of each story. BTW: I am not shy about reading LONG, INTROSPECTIVE mysteries; it's just that the word count should justify my time spent.

The termination of THE DRESDEN FILES series after only one season is a testimony to the lack of target-audience insight and the inability to recognize quality entertainment product on the part of the network's programming directors and other top decision-makers. But good TV programs are perishable items and often overstay their shelf life, so it may be a blessing that this little gem of a show will be fondly remembered for its great - but very short - run.",1350950400,2,1633,4.934545454545455
2845169,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I remember seeing the Dresden Files on Sci-Fi when it was not SyFy, and while it didn't initially hook me like it did after a second viewing here on Amazon, it did pique my interest.  The acting is very solid, the writing is FANTASTIC, and like most good shows killed before their time, suffered because of shoddy marketing.  I could easily see this being turned into a movie, and I think it would benefit greatly from the advances in special effects that have been made since the show was originally on.

Paul Blackthorne is very likable as Harry Dresden, and Terrance Mann is great as Bob.  He's arguably the real star of the show in a lot of ways, and extra compelling because of the wealth of possible backstory.  Bob died in 900 A.D. and has been trapped in his own skull as a ghost since that time, so one can only imagine the level of possible experiences that are there for him as a character.  Murphy (played by Valerie Cruz) is likable enough, and a logical foil to the swords and sorcery world that Harry rides the fence of.

If you like Supernatural at all, you will probably love The Dresden Files.  They're cut from the same cloth in a lot of the same ways.",1349308800,,1171,4.388888888888889

He doesn't live in a basement, he has technology,(Our Harry FRIES technology) Murphy isn't a blonde, Harry is serious and is a bit short of the 6'5"" wise cracking Harry that we read about and love.

2845171,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Have you ever noticed how so many Sci-Fi and fantasy shows start strong... and quickly degenerate into the same old personal conflicts you find in every soap opera? The Dresden Files is not like that. In fact, every single episode is  better than the one that precedes it. Each one tells you a bit more about Harry, his history, and what he's capable of. No doubt that's because the shows are each based on one of the novels, with all (or most) of the story line of the novel compressed into one powerful episode.

Regardless of how they did it, this is a first rate show, with tight scripting, excellent acting, and some very clever special effects. The show, and the character of Harry Dresden, are like nothing you've seen before. I was introduced to the show by friends who are big fans of the books and the show, and even though I didn't think it would appeal to me I became an immediate fan. There's only one problem with the show: There's only one season of episodes! :-(",1344816000,,978,4.4581005586592175

The 'alternate reality' of this series compares to The Dresden Files books about the same way that the JJ Abrams 'alternate reality' of Star Trek compares to the original TV series. By itself this made-for-TV series is interesting, but hard-core Dresden fans may find the changes unacceptable. Karrin Murphy, Bob the skull, the Blue Beetle, and Harry's staff have all been reworked.

  There were both legal and practical considerations for the changes from the books. The novels and short stories deserve a decidedly ""R"" rating. By trying to tone this down for the PG-13 crowd, Syfy took a lot away from the series, mostly from the character of Bob. Still, Terrence Mann is an excellent choice for that character. Paul Blackthorne (Harry) and Conrad Coates (Morgan) were cast well, but even those characters are a bit watered down.

  I would recommend this as an interesting diversion, but Dresden book fans should not expect too much.",1344470400,,1286,5.8138297872340425
2845173,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I must admit that I forgot about this series because it seemed to pop on and off so quickly. I was happily surprised to see it available free for Prime users.

What I liked was the intelligence of the series. I do hate when the writers' have to explain everything. The first few episodes did contain flashbacks, but the audience gets to know more and more about the characters via the scripts each week.

I think trying to capture the books was the only failing. Probably the network was too impatient to let the characters grow naturally and let the audience find out more. Too often I find that the series I like, the characters are explored the first season and then all that remains are endless episodes where people are matched and mixed up. Dresden seems too ""broken"" a character to write into the silly soap opera scripts.

That does not mean he isn't a sucker for children, damsel's in distress, or anyone else with a little angst. Half the show one wonder how he makes ends meet when he does not seem to get paid by anyone. I think that is the highest praise for any series when the characters appear to be real people even if they are dealing with fantasy situations. That also says a lot for the main actors. They approach the show as if they don't have to be embarrassed by the content (which they don't). That alone adds depth to the series.

One thing I would note to others watching or buying the series is to pay attention to air dates. The original series was aired in 2007 and then a couple of episodes were aired in 2010. But the order of the 1st season has the 2010 episodes mixed in with the 2007.",1344384000,,1892,4.830246913580247

  I read a whole lot of Sci-Fi. When I ran across Jim Butcher's work I went to town. In the last few years I've read almost everything written by this wonderful author.

2845199,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I have read and reread this series many times and could reread many more times. Needless to say, I am a fan of the Dresden Files. When I first saw this I was filled with hope and dread. The hope was that it would be a good representation of the characters, diverse world, and story that I know and love. The dread was that it would be absolutely horrific. Like ""some of the scenes Dresden has to view in his line of work"" horrific. And when I finally watched all the episodes I was pleasantly surprised. Only two of the episodes are based of the books (One veeery loosely) which means they expanded Dresden's adventures and at the same time, weren't squeezing his books into an hour slot.

Now to talk about the special effects. In the books Dresden was known for burning down several buildings. This is obviously beyond the realm of sci-fi's (because they weren't yet scy-fy) visual effects budget so we don't see this side of Dresden. The creature effects are at standard sci-fi channel level but the other effects aren't cheap or less than seamless. In this series Bob appears as a ghost (still resides in the skull) who has a human form when speaking with Dresden. The effects people did a good job of keeping him from interacting with the world around him (as he is a ghost). There is even a special feature on the DVD showing some of the obstacles they encountered with this.

The people that read this review will want to know which characters were shown and how they were portrayed. I can happily say that they were all played well. Yes I could whine saying, ""Murphy's hair is supposed to be blond. Why isn't it blond? It should be blond."" but that isn't all that important. Actually that is about the only complaint people should have for her. She is still shorter than Dresden and is still a very tough cop (the shorter thing isn't very important either). Dresden is still a smartaleck and trades banter with Bob. Bob isn't as creepely fascinated with romance novels and I, personally, am ok with that.

Overall I would give this 3.5 stars out of 5.",1340582400,,2059,4.514745308310992

2845230,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Despite my low expectations of any new Sci-Fi Channel series, I watched a couple of episodes of ""Dresden Files"" when it was on in 2007, thought it was pretty good, and that's how I found out about the novels, of which I became a huge fan.
My recollection of the TV series was that it wasn't too bad, maybe rose to the level of pretty good, but when I found out it was on Amazon Prime, and went back and watched the whole series, I found out I was wrong.  It's not pretty good.
It's excellent!

If you happen to be a fan of the novels, you have to accept that this is not the novels; it's a different adaptation of the Harry Dresden canon.  Most, or maybe all, of the episodes are based on, or at least share ideas with, the early novels, and some things are the same, but some are different.  That's how it is.  Jim Butcher himself said that it's to be considered an alternate reality, and if you expect the TV series to be the same as the novels, you'll be disappointed.  I struggled with it a little bit myself.  I can accept that there are reasons for most of the differences; I can see why Murphy is different, why Bob manifests with a human appearance, etc.  I can't see why they had to change Murphy's first name, or turn the Blue Beetle into this stupid jeep, but whatever.  You have to get past that to appreciate the TV series.  That said, it is the same character, by the same author, and in essential ways it's faithful to the spirit of the Dresden stories.

If you haven't read the novels, I'd say best thing is to watch this series first and enjoy it for what it is, then look into the novels.  If you have read the novels, you have to have a talk with yourself and make it clear to yourself that this series is related to the novels, but it's not them, and don't expect everything to be the same.  If you can do that, it's very enjoyable.

The casting, acting and direction are superb, and so is the writing.  It's really good TV.  The special effects are pretty weak for the 21st century; I guess they didn't have the budget.  Some of the sets are gorgeous, though-- Harry's place, his uncle's mansion.  I'm talking about the series as a whole; I found the first episode, ""Birds of a Feather"", rather weak, though it does get the job done in terms of setting up the characters, setting, and premise.  The scary monsters just aren't scary enough, though.

If you watch the episodes in order of appearance, it gets better and better.  The last two in particular are outstanding.

I don't know why it wasn't continued; partly, I'm sure, it's just because the SciFi Channel, or Squiffy or whatever they call themselves now, has no taste and always cancels the best shows, e.g. Farscape.  Perhaps, it didn't catch on with enough viewers-- but as someone else pointed out, they kept showing it at weird times, which is one of the things they do when they want to kill a show.

Actually I'm not sure that the  TV series could have developed the way the novels have.  It certainly would take a bigger budget; you'd need a huge cast before you got very far, and lots of CGI.  This is the Harry of the early novels, just scraping by, not the powerful wizard that Harry becomes in the later novels.  The characters were already developing in different directions; for example, Harry and Morgan, Harry and Murphy, work together pretty well by the end of the 12 episodes, long before they got to that point in the novels.  Anyway, this is what it is.  Approach it with an open mind, and I think you'll be pleased.",1330992000,,3515,4.363076923076923

I bought the audio book... now THOSE are awesome... at least the ones produced by buzzy multimedia and read by James Marsters... once they changed narrators I quit spending my money on them)

If I'd found the TV series I probably would have liked it more. I didn't so... it's just okay.

The main character, a professional ""wizard""/detective,  provides narrative for each episode in the spirit of an old-fashioned detective series.  The special effects for his wizardry are so bad that it has to be intentional.

And that's just fine; because this show is a combination of entertaining story, magic just silly enough that kids will like it while adults will laugh, along with persistent sexual innuendos just subtle enough that adults will bust a gut while their kids will ask, ""what's so funny about that?"".

When it was on TV I actually didn't quite bond with it, but a few years later I came across it here and have a fresh new positive opinion, so maybe it just appeals to 40 somethings more than youngins.

In fact, I'll actually say if you like the show, steer clear of the books.  The show actually tries to make Dresden somewhat likeable.  In the book, he was just a self-loathing bum who I couldn't even be bothered to feel sorry for.  In the TV show, he's still that, but at least I can empathize with him.

Still, the show does bring a somewhat unique concept and does it pretty well.  Some of the motivations aren't clear (although, I found them worse in the book, because they were explained and I found everyone to be hypocritical.)

From the 1st few pages, I realized what a rare gem this TV series was. The TV episodes where better written than the books themselves. A lot better. For me that was a first. Then again the last contemporary author I truly enjoyed reading and hold in esteem was Patrick O'Brian. I belong to those readers who seem to only like novels which were written some time before they were born.
So I slaved through the first few Dresden novels, but the books never got me immersed into their mythology like the TV episodes did. And while I really liked the TV Dresden, I could not get myself to care for the 'printed' Dresden at all.
To give you some idea how good this show was IMHO, its the only SciFi channel production after Battlestar Galactica I ever cared for (and Firefly if you count it as a SCiFi channel production).

Other thoughts: I had a similar experience with Dexter-show vs Dexter-Books, though the Dexter books were more near the mark. Now after getting hooked on HBO's Game of Thrones, I'm getting the books. I'm not very hopeful though. Nevertheless I have to give it a shot before giving up on living writers and sticking with the dead ones. It seems to me that modern writers are geared towards writing for the screen rather than the page. They have forgotten how to bring a character to life in print.

Paul Blackthorne did a great job portraying Harry as far as he was allowed to.  However, the way that it was written for TV took a lot of the mystique and enjoyment out of it.  I thought it was HILARIOUS how in the ""making of"" portion it was said that they couldn't put the Sci-Fi/Fantasy in the story for the Sci-Fi channel.  Uhm, then don't bill the channel as Sci-Fi if you're not going to put it on there.  Funny people.  Don't think that comment was well thought out.

I LOVED Jim Butcher's books, but having watched this I understand why the series was canceled.  Compared to the books this was just a VERY washed out version of Butcher's books related to them by a couple of Butcher's characters (at least their names, if nothing else) and a few VERY vague plot points.  Since WHEN was Harry a player?  Ancient Mia is heavily involved in Chicago's metaphysical politics and the one who is so hard on Harry? Morgan is his buddy?  Maybe I missed all that in the books.

Harry goes from being a slightly socially awkward/moody guy who's made some bad choices which he has to try to overcome, trying to make his way through the world using his magic to help make the world a better place to...let's see...one, two, three women he went through INCLUDING Bianca... Bianca...really?  Not looking for depth in the TV characters were they?  I mean, Butcher's characters might have had a lot of baggage, but I don't know many people who don't have some in real life and in the circumstances that these people would have been living in they would have had a good amount.  I mean, for goodness sake, Harry was orphaned at a young age and then was adopted by a man who turned on him and tried to kill him when he wouldn't use his magic for the bad.  WHO WOULDN'T HAVE SOME BAGGAGE FROM THAT? Not to mention the trauma from the actual killing of the man he had come to think of as his father to save himself and the trial and such afterward.

Mind you, if you have not read the books, you might not mind. I however do mind greatly. Some of the biggest key elements of this show took a dump on the book's rich histories and full chast of characters.

If you read any of the books, you will hate this show. If you haven't, it will be on par with another Buffy the Vampire Slayer-esque universe of bad makeup, and retarded stories.

I think it would have been phenomenal if they did what the creators/producers of the Dexter series did and take each book and make it into one season. There's waaay too much detail in one book to be able to make it into one 48 minute episode. And then they would've had 6 seasons right off the bat and been able to put all the character growth and depth into every episode, instead of flailing about and making things up as they went along...like changing major aspects of the character. Bob I think is either you love what they did or hate it - in the books, he's a spirit of knowledge. In the series, he's basically a ghost inhabiting a skull who is passed from Justin to Harry. Also another ""wtf"" moment of the TV series - changing what happened between Justin (I want to say it's his uncle, but I feel like I might be remembering it wrong). In the books, Harry was a kid when he took him out, and it was in a fiery inferno death match. In the series, accidental smushing of a voodoo doll equivalent. Less epic, and less impressive.

(I might get a slew of ""did not help"" votes from those people for saying that. Eh, not too concerned.)

The series should be judged as a series, not how it compares to the books.

The Characters:

Harry Dresden comes off as very likeable and naturally funny. A wizard listed in the phone book, yet reluctant hero. He can pull off some pretty nice magic when he wants, yet is conservative and careful as to when he will use it or not.
The actor playing him, Paul Blackthorne, does a fine acting job, a very believable performance.

Lt. Connie Murphy is an...ok...character, in my opinion. She's a touch single divorcee, mother, and indluges Dresden's more magical aspects even though she doesn't believe in magic herself. The only real negatives that I have about her is:

A)She has no believable chemistry with Dresden, in my opinion, so the eventual hint of her attraction toward him feels weird.
B)The episodes are more enjoyable when it's just Dresden and she's only in a limited number of scenes.

Hrothbert ""Bob"" of Bainbridge is an amusing character, the obvious comic relief character. However...
The actor playing him though does a horrible accent, and his acting seems better suited for a stage play than a TV series...very overly dramatic delivery and body movements; too much too often, in my opinion.

Warden Donald Morgan, a Warden of the High Council (kind of the police, for wizards and supernatural beings) is pretty good, mostly serious but just enough charisma to be a likeable character. I like the banter between him and Dresden when there is a difference of opinion, based not only on Morgan being a stickler for the rules but also because he and Dresden have different personalities.

The Writing:

The writing seems tamer than it probably should be, though it was good enough that I stuck with the series all through it's original television run. I liked that they didn't rely on a bunch of flashy magic scenes, focusing more on character interaction and devlopment. The writing kind of reminded me of Doctor Who, in that it was safe for kids to watch, for the most part.
Personally I found no memorable quotes in the series, though lots of witty banter.
All of the episodes felt nicely done, not a dud in the bunch.

Overall:

Though not a show filled with much special effects, it's worth watching for the character of Harry Dresden, who I have nothing negative to say about. Had they given this series a second season, no question I would have watched it.
If you're looking for a show similar to Supernatural, Buffy, or Witchblade, this is not that show, in my opinion....well, kind of like Witchblade, actually.
If however you're looking for a show that has some supernatural elements while mostly a fun detective show, this one will please you.

That's My Opinion But You're Welcome To It.",1298160000,3,3081,4.716945996275605
2845382,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I've heard people on both sides argue about the series. You either come to the books through the canceled show or you come to the show through the series of books. In either case, this series optioned from Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series and went on cable for thirteen shows before getting canceled.

I was halfway through Storm Front when I started watching these; I finished Summer Knight at the thirteenth episode.

What I always find fascinating is the frothy rabidity fans, especially reading fans have towards the film or television adaptation of a series. Watch the fanboys of the Lord of the Rings scream about how there wasn't enough sitting around talking about Elven history in the movie and you get some of the idea.

In either case, the Dresden Files stands on its own - a good, decent noir detective series with conflict and humor and a somewhat grubby main character partnered up with a Chicago cop. Had it kept going it could easily have rolled along into another cult scifi series; as it stands, it has fans akin to Buffy, Firefly, and Dollhouse in their dedication.

I still enjoy the series, but readers of the series expecting to find the Harry, Murphy, or Air Spirit Bob of the books will be disappointed; Harry, Bob, and Murphy are their own characters in the series with their own motivations and their own roles. One of the potential reasons for going ""off-script"" of the books may have been the considerations of Butcher's writing - it would be devilishly hard to run the special effects budget for more of Butcher's plot lines, especially those involving the Faerie Realms (and Butcher gleefully took the series way past what even cable television would do past 12:30 AM).

On its own, this is a fun series and enjoyable to watch. If trying to compare the books to the series and expecting one to mirror the other - just don't. It's not going to end well for any of us, least of all the actors and writers who've worked on both.",1297987200,,1957,4.644508670520231
2845383,3,B000QUEQ4U,"Purists might object to how some seemingly important details were altered from the books to create this short-lived TV series. Two prime examples: Murphy is now a tall Latina instead of a five-foot-nothing blonde, and Bob now takes human form to converse with Harry--although he remains a spirit bound to a skull in Harry's position, and he retains his essential ... Bob personality.

I'm not a purist myself, but as an enthusiastic fan of the books I felt that the spirit of the characters was still preserved. Remember, presenting something visually--especially as part of a series--requires very different tricks to achieve the same effect rendered by words on a page. My only objection is not getting to see Murphy put the Aikido smackdown on anybody.

I'd gladly give the series itself five stars, but when I first received the DVD set the first disc was scratched enough that my DVD player skipped over huge chunks of one of the episodes. I exchanged the damaged set for another set from Amazon.com (excellent customer service, thank you) only to find that the first disc from the new set was also damaged--in the same place! When I tried to exchange THAT set as well they informed me that they'd checked their stock and found a similar problem with the remaining stock, so I just gave up and returned the item for a refund instead of waiting an unspecified period for a possible exchange.

2845403,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Visual Media versions of print stories often vary from the original source material, causing outrage in those who wanted to see the story made for film. This show polarizes people more than just about any other. It would be fair to say that in its day The Dresden files created as much shock and horror from Jim Butcher's readership as poor old Peter Jackson generated with his LotR trilogy.

Let me start by saying that I've read most of the Dresden Files books, and regard them as an okay waste of a few hours but very uneven in feel. Butcher's admitted approach to writing them (according to a talk he gave in NY shortly after the publication of White Night) means that a Dresden story can never be more than a spectator sport anyway; the reader has no chance of anticipating events and becoming thereby part of the story. You pays your money etc.

The TV Dresden is what would be called today a ""re-imagining"", not quite a Star Trek ""reboot"" but a remix using the basic ideas from which the books are built. In this approach lies much of the chagrin. ""Harry doesn't look right"". ""Murphy doesn't look right, and they changed her name"". ""What on earth is Bob doing with a face?"" ""The Chateau Dresden isn't right"". etc etc etc

Well, let's get that out of the way. All the complaints are spot on. The physical descriptions of just about everything from Dresden to Bianca to the Blue Beetle (now a olive green jeep) are different to those in the books. Big Furry Deal.

Okay, anyone who doesn't want show spoilers should move on.

The TV Dresden is an excellent envisioning of the Wizard private eye, with a great screen presence and just the right amount of slobbish attitude for the role. Much has been made of the improvised nature of the Wizard Staff (or Hockey Stick) and blasting rod (now a drumstick) but I think these actually work well to reinforce the image of the down-at-heel, one step away from the bailiff wizard with barely two bucks to rub together. The Jeep was picked for the ease of camera work (can't see the actors in a VW Beetle) but the rationale for the Beetle in the books actually works better for the Jeep (lack of mechanical complexity) in my opinion. Murphy isn't blonde, but *is* in-your-face feisty (though I have to agree changing her name was dumb and the suggestion she has a nine year old daughter - whom we never see - is unnecessary). Some characters from the books appear wearing new and unexpected faces. Some are in very different roles than in the books - Bianca is a vampire of the Red Court, but that's about all that survives the transition to the screen. If this is going to ruin the experience for you, better save your dollars for more books.

The Special Effects are good for their day (people forget how quickly the state of the art in CGI advanced when they critique this show sometimes) but sometimes have a slightly bargain basement feel, especially when the producers attempt to ""wow"" the viewer. As I say, the pace of progress should inform the viewer, but it should also inform the maker of cgi-intensive shows and dictate a suitable approach to using SFX.

What really makes or breaks a show is, of course, the plot and character interaction we get to see, and like any show in its first season, these tend to vary. Occasionally there is a whiff of ""the special effects will blind everyone to the lack of quality plot here"", but on the whole the plots are tight, the stories compelling and the chemistry between the actors is convincing, especially that between Harry and Bob the Skull.

Remaking the character Bob into a cursed sorcerer whose spirit is bound to the skull for eternity for a wizardly crime was inspired, and getting the actor Terrence Mann to play Bob was genius. The irony of Paul Blackthorne (Harry) being an Englishman using an American accent and Terrence Mann being an American using an English accent is a free gift (both seem well executed to my ears). Scenes between Bob and Harry are generally high spots in each show, though sometimes the actors have to work with dialog that makes them work for their money.

Finally, I thought combining Dresden's workplace with his voluminous living quarters was a good move. It gave the actors space to use when setting the scene for each episode.

I enjoyed the show, and this three disc set represents it in a nice package. there are a couple of deleted scenes, a couple of commentaries and a ""making of"" featurette and that's it for the special features. I wished for more, but didn't buy the discs for the blooper reels and cutting room floor sweepings.

I'm sorry this show didn't get a large enough following to garner a second season. The first season was only twelve episodes too (do you remember when a season was 24 shows or more?) so it burned bright but burned quickly. I doubt being more faithful to the books would have made it more popular, but who knows? Personally, I rather like the original touches the show added to the Dresden Files, *including* the hockey stick and a Bob you can see.",1285718400,2,5026,4.585746102449889

It can get a little corny at times, but by and large the stories are fun, engaging and pretty close to the books although as with all things, the books are better than the movie.  Fans who have read the books will want to start with Episode 8 which should really be the Pilot because it starts off with a really tamed up for TV version of the Book Storm Front, by Jim Butcher.  Other than that the stories presented are more an amalgamation of several books rather than 1st book, Storm Front, 2nd book, Fool Moon, etc. I would think this is a G rated series or maybe PG13.

Blasting rod? A drum stick, Oh yea, that's clever.....

His staff? A hockey stick. Huh?  Was the prop budget totally used up and it was trash day?

The writers/producers were obviously fans of Quantum Leap.  Sam=Harry. Al=Androgynous Skull Ghost Guy.  The Waiting Room=The Skull.

The plots? could have been great, some were well done, but the acting is so bad, the actors (except for the cops) so badly cast, that it's just awful.  If I had seen the series first, I would have skipped the books.  Fortunately I had read some of the books first, so I could see how lame the TV series was.

How can anyone take a drumstick wielding, hockey-stick carrying, clumsy dimwit seriously? That's how Harry is portrayed. Not as the soul searching, over-powered, under-trained do-gooder.

The writers confuse his Shield Bracelet with Wonder Woman's bracelets. No, it does not deflect or catch bullets, or require Harry to hold it up in front of said firearm. Did they even bother to read the books?

The series could have been called ""The Storefront Wizard"" and skipped Dresdin altogether. No fan would have possibly confused the two, as the series is so far removed from the books.

Want to watch a generic, poorly acted wizard detective series? It's passable. Barely.  Want to watch a Harry Dresdin TV series? Skip this mess. I don't know how Jim Butcher let them, well, butcher this series so badly.  The first clue it is going to stink? SciFi channel!!! The next clue? SciFi Channel.  The final clue? It was replaced by Flash Gordon. Another well written series that survived a world war, badly done movies, a and a classic BW TV series. Only to finally be killed by the . . . SciFi channel.

Here are my thoughts in no particular order about the series.

I thought Harry was going to be better looking, maybe this is why it didn't do too well, no heartthrob factor. I mean the actor (Paul Blackthorne) who plays Harry isn't horrid or anything but he also isn't Hugh Jackman. The guy did the best with what was given to him and he played Harry well, he walked with the confidence and delivered his lines with belief. I mean there are not that many actors who can hold a drumstick in their hands and make it look like anything but weird. The show would have been good given half a chance; he was a like able character who loved to play the knight in shining armour.

They did a terrible job of representing the female characters such as Murphy and Susan. Their hair colours were switched around and who was that random Linda chick? (maybe she comes along in the books later or something)

Just like in the books there is way too many corny lines ""I am who the cops call when they need miracles"" ""I am a wizard, I don't do parties"" blah blah blah. For goodness sake your audience is not that stupid (well....maybe they are) but they don't need reminding ever two seconds that you are a wizard and that the books and the show are about the 'real magic' that happens all around us. Most people have read a book like it so stop shoving it down our throats.

I thought Bob being a human ghosty actually worked, I liked that character probably the most, maybe cause he is a little cranky but like able.

Morgan was no where near scary or intimidating, he was just a jerk.

They went over and over and over and over the flashbacks of dear old Justin biting the dust, don't think watching it all in one weekend helped with that irritating me but overkill.

Where the hell was Marcone?

Bianca was more like the TV Vampires that are around and not like the creature that was in the book at all.

I think the biggest thing that made this series fail (whether they were ever going to give it more than one season I don't know) is that they tried to put each book into 42 min episodes, there are a lot of twists and turns in the books and in the show it just gets gutted and rushed. You fail when you try and cover so much in so little time and also try to do any character development. Why they didn't pick a few really good story arcs and weave them into one great season is beyond me. Good fun to watch but and anything with magic in it is alright with me.",1271721600,,2692,4.17953667953668

Many of the changes made sense--the Jeep replacing the Beetle, Murphy not being blond...those are minor and really don't impact the quality of the series.  But the show manages to fall flat in other ways.  They took what was a good urban fantasy and turned into a detective show with a few minor supernatural elements.  They just lost the heart of the series. In the books, the two are melded; magic and investigation are used to overcome pretty wicked adversaries. There's just nothing really comparable here.  Take any private eye show, add a splash of magic...that's it.

I think the TV series did capture the ""flavor"" of the book series though. I recommend both very highly.

In case you don't know anything about the series, it is about the adventures of Harry Dresden, a wizard. Harry hires himself out as sort of a private detective for weird cases. It seems like the Chicago police are his main client - when they get a really weird case, they call him in.

I think that most people will like the Harry character. He is a powerful wizard, but still a rather humble and all around nice guy. He has interesting friends as well, including Bob who lives in a skull (the ghost I think of a medieval wizard) and Murphy of the Chicago police (a lady cop and one tough cookie as they used to say).

2845541,4,B000QUEQ4U,"This was a series that suffered from two main problems -- it only ran for 12 epsidoes, and it was cancelled after the first season.

This was a fun and entertaining show. The ""hero"" - Harry Dresden had painted on his front door ""Harry Dresden / Wizard"" and of course, there were jokes about Harry Potter from one or two of the characters.

Harry was the reluctant hero. Mostly he just wanted to be left alone, but somehow he was always dragged into some problem or crime that was supernatural in nature - vampires, demons, werewolves, etc.(similar to some of the storylines of ""Charmed"").

There was the obligatory attractive female detective, Lt. Connie Murphy (played by the very capable Valerie Cruz), that he had to keep from finding out about the supernatural world while solving the crime of the week.

And there were other interesting characters, such as Bob, a ghost who was cursed to live in his own skull for trying to raise his lover from the dead, and served as Harry's advisor. And there was Morgan, a Warden of the High Council, which is the governing body of the wizard community.

For the price - less than $15, this is certainly worth the money. The only downside is that it will make you wish there had been a second, a third, and even a fourth, season.",1254182400,,1271,4.557017543859649

2845543,2,B000QUEQ4U,"Well, I admit that I read the book(s) first, so this review is somewhat biased, but still I think a screen production can do much better.

I am aware of the fact that the TV-adaption of the ""Dresden Files"" was supposed to be fundamentally different from the books, something like a new interpretation of the ""Dreden Files"", and, well, it definately is.

But instead of transferring the atmosphere of the books (which is one of the most remarkable assets of Jim Butcher's work) to the screen and elaborating on that, the TV episodes create a dull and somewhat lifeless image or shadow, to remain in the realm of the written Dresden Files, with rather shallow characters and far too shallow story lines. The screenplay writers should have taken HBO's The Wire as guide to creating a good plot along with believable and interesting character evolvement.

After all, TV and full length motion pictures are just another form of story telling, for which a good storyline and good characters are essential. And given that an already excellent storyline existed, the outcome is even more disappointing.

Before you ask why I gave it two stars instead of one: There are some (but not many) nice ideas in the TV-production that gain at least some merit.",1252195200,,1243,4.821596244131455

Supposedly it takes place in Chicago but was actually filmed in Canada.  With that said, it was well done and it felt like Chicago the whole time.  I loved the scenes of Chicago landscapes and really took a liking to the characters.  I REALLY took a liking to the characters!  If this program was returned to syndication, I would be a fan.  Is it the best series ever?  Not at all, but I found myself looking forward to the next episode and often viewed several at a time.  For some strange reason, episode eight (8) -- if I remember correctly -- was really the first episode and was disappointingly out of sync.  However, that was a small problem.  Watch number eight first perhaps.  You will see a different office and his ghost friend was missing.  His confidant (the ghost) becomes very important in the whole.  There was a bit of romance which added to the programs.  Some of the stories were better than others and number one was ""scary"" (preview before letting your kids see it)!

I'm renting it now and have watched the first eight episodes (in two long evenings mmmmm good!). At first it looked like they were prepared for a long series and were trying to introduce it right by gradually building things up similar to the books. But all of a sudden in episode 8, Harry starts breaking out the firepower and starts showing a little of his defiance and anger and why his enemies might start to fear him a little. Paul Blackthorne does a nice job with Harry, making him both likeable, human, amusing, and at the same time showing his relentlessness and strength.

I don't mind the changes from the book, it's kind of fun to see things from a different angle, and bearing in mind that they probably couldn't afford to do a lot of scenes in the Never-never for instance. I *am* hoping to catch a glimpse of Michael Carpenter by the end of the series, but I don't know whether that will happen or not.

I did like seeing the blue VW beetle up on the rack at the mechanic's shop, nice homage to the book, and it was good to catch a glimpse of Mister.

Can't they ever keep a fun series on the air long enough for it to catch on? Couldn't they have canceled a dozen lame reality shows without anyone missing them instead? One of these days one of these great series is actually going to catch on fire before it's canceled. I hope. I would love to have 100+ episodes of this to watch.

2845582,1,B000QUEQ4U,"The Harry Dresden books are some of the best books of their genre.  This series could not have had more potential.  Especially now after seeing how magnificent a job HBO has done with TrueBlood (which, as you probably know, is an adaptation of Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Series) I really would have thought that the Harry Dresden books would have been the perfect springboard for an incredible TV show.  BUT....Nope!  For some unfathomable reason the stories and characters were changed in so many ways, and all of the changes were for the worse and none of the changes made any sense; the whole series seemed like an exercise in needless dumbing down.  Probably the stupidest move of all was to try to make each book into a 40-45 minute show (an hour with commercials) when even the most basic treatment of any of the Harry Dresden books would have required AT LEAST 6 full episodes -- but really should have been a full 12.  The stories in the books are so clever -- so full of unexpected wonderful notions!  They are absolutely delightful and are always absorbing and full of adventure.  This TV show somehow took these amazingly creative tales and made them trite, predictable and even boring.  I don't know what sort of talent it takes to mangle perfectly good stories so thouroughly... I really expected so much more from the SciFi Channel (or SyFy channel, whatever).  For shame, people. So, I would like to join the others who voiced a hope that someone ELSE would decide to bring these books to life and to do it right this time (and maybe TV isn't the place?  I'd LOVE to go see Harry Dresden at the movies!).  These books, if translated properly into films or a television series, would be sensational.  PLEASE...PLEASE...will someone who is actually GOOD at turning books into films take up this cause?  And meanwhile, people who are hoping to pop in a good DVD about a wizard named Harry...well...

The show does not do the books justice, and the viewer is hopelessly lost in the plotlines.

Instead of elaborating on some of the stories that the books leave open (hello car eaten out by some sorta bugs down to the steel?), it tries to condense ""Storm Front"" into a single episode.

2845593,4,B000QUEQ4U,"The films of the TV series are based loosely on the books but are nonetheless compelling and fascinating viewing. The principal characters are all present in the TV series, although in some cases (such as Bob the spirit in the skull, Bianca the vampire and Old Mai) they are modified from their characters as they appear in the books.  Morgan is not bad.  He has the detestation of Harry perfectly acted, and yet is forced by his position on the White Council to give what can only be called unwilling assistance to Harry at various times.  Lieutenant Murphy is quite well done and she has the correct abrasive nature with Harry but still manages to show some respect and ""unwilling liking"" for him.  They work as a good team, just as they do in the books, even if there is abrasion all the time.

It would be impossible for a 3/4hour long episode to create, in that time period, one of the 10 books published - so the movies take an aspect of the books that perhaps might be a chapter or several chapters, and make that into a full episode. Each episode is a complete story and they are very nicely rounded off.  It is very pleasing that the series does not descend into ""gory details"" very much at all.  You know a particularly horrific thing has happened and you can see the corpse, but you are thankfully not shown the blood and details which too often is used to ""sell"" movies these days.  The Dresden Files stands on its own merit and doesn't need anything more except its stories to help.

If there is one flaw with the Zone 1 version I received from Amazon, it was that it was lacking in subtitles.  The PAL version available in Australia does have excellent subtitles and is much better for viewing by those with hearing impediments.  On the other hand, the Zone 1 version has a large amount of extra material about the making of the series which seems to be partially lacking in the Australian release.

The dvd series is an excellent way to tempt a newcomer to read Jim Butcher's books and the dvd and book series complement each other very nicely because neither is exactly the same and the books are far more complex in their stories and overall structures.

I highly recommend the Dresden Files disk as an exciting journey through the worlds of magic and fantasy and the only reason this review did not give 5 stars is the lack of subtitles on the disk.....But to a person with normal hearing, consider it a 5 star rating.  Excellent viewing, good actors, great stories, and if what I hear is correct, an enormous pity that a second series is not in production.",1236470400,,2575,4.497854077253219

What this series is is an adaptation of the books and while they can be judged wanting due to the superficial plot translation, I for one am glad that these books have been made into the series. And while the stories generally start and end in the same place, the means that the TV show gets there is somewhat truncated. This allows the books and the show to stand somewhat independently. I like both for different reasons and I was initially disappointed with the series but grew to like it because it gave me the character visualization and reference that is actually very well translated.

2845625,3,B000QUEQ4U,"I was initially skeptical when this series was being advertised on Sci-Fi.  Having read Butcher's excellent books, I had some very clear perceptions of the recurring characters and their surroundings.  A complete miss in any or all of the concept, casting, and/or execution would certainly not be a first in the book-to-film/TV game, and was more than likely given my pre-conceived notions.  Somewhat surprisingly, concept and execution matched and occasionally exceeded expectation, although I quibble with such transformations as Harry's home being more like a storefront than the dank and dreary apartment of the books, and with him driving a Jeep (!!!!!) instead of the Beetle.  But, those nit-picks aside, the overall effort is reasonable.  Hollywood does a predictable job of sexing-up of Murphy, and Valerie Cruz can certainly slap cuffs on me anytime she wants.  Conrad Coates is an inspired choice as Morgan, and given the obvious technical challenges inherent in Bob's character, his manifestation by Terrence Mann is as good as it gets.  As for Paul Blackthorne as Harry, it took me a hell of a long time to buy him.  I still read the books differently than I watch the show, and that's mostly due to Blackthorne; he's a decent actor for the material, but is he Harry?  Deep fans of the books may or may not agree.  If you're a TV person and have never even heard of Jim Butcher and never intend to go find out, you're probably fine, have fun with this limited series that probably got yanked before its' time.",1231372800,,1521,4.883268482490273

The show had a little bit of everything to appeal to a broad range of viewers... supernatural elements, detective/mystery, humor, action.... coupled with a superlative cast who's character chemistry was some of the best ever assembled and special effects that neither were overdone or too cheesy. The show was one that the entire family could sit down and enjoy... not many of those shows around these days!

While the show grew in popularity and viewership as the season progressed, for some reason SciFi chose not to renew it. A huge mistake on their part as the continuing popularity of author/creator Jim Butcher's novels and now graphic novel comics, as well as the brisk sales of the DVD is proving that The Dresden Files was a great show that was not given the chance to live up to it's full potential.

2845642,3,B000QUEQ4U,"Ok, here's the deal. While the producers didn't go out of their way to make this clear, ""The Dresden Files"" is NOT an original series. It's based off of a series of books by Jim Butcher by the same name. The reason it only gets 3.5 stars in my book has less to do with an actual dislike of the series, and more disappointment in what it could have been. The books are, beyond question, the BEST ones I have ever read (move over, Harry Potter and Eragon). If they had stuck more closely to the origninal material, this would be a 5 star series still in production.",1226966400,,563,4.222222222222222
2845643,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I have not yet read the books that this series was based on so I have no real frame of reference as far as how faithful it was, but based on its own merits I thought it was really good. Some of the creature effects could have been a little better, but given the budget they probably had to work with I thought they did rather well. The interplay and banter between Harry and Bob is quite good, and is usually very humorous. I liked the fact that it was usually like a detective story more than a straight-up supernatural problem. The supernatural element was a large part of the show, as anyone who knows anything about this series would know, but the life of Harry Dresden is quite compelling overall. The things he goes through between trying to pay his bills doing consultant work for the police department, dealing with paranormal activity, and being under constant scrutiny by fellow magic users makes the drama of his life interesting. Plus, there is a large factor of rewatchability. So buy this as quickly as you can and watch it more than once.",1226016000,2,1053,4.518324607329843
2845644,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I picked this up on a whim, and I kind of liked it.  Since film adaptations of books invariably veer from the source material, I gave the books a try, and found I liked the series better.  In the books, it seems to me Harry is a keg of dynamite looking to explode of someone, and it's hard to root for someone with anger management issues.

In the series, Harry is just as scruffy, but a lot more likeable mostly because he often finds himself on the short end of the stick.  Being able to see Bob also added a more human touch to the series, and Murphy just wasn't some excuse for Harry to get cases; she had some depth to her.

Now that I discovered it, I wish it could have gotten another chance, but oh well.  Give this one a try if you can find it.",1225929600,,753,4.02013422818792
2845645,3,B000QUEQ4U,"The first thing I did after putting the DVD in was hunt frantically for subtitles; it's nearly impossible to make out the dialogue over the overmiked bgm and sound effects.

There are no subtitles available on the DVD.

This makes the first episode almost unwatchable, and impairs many of the subsequent episodes.

Dresden wakes up with a lady in the opening scenes, his father knew about his magical abilities, and Bob is a semi-effete platinum blond guy who only occasionally (probably because it interrupts his brotherly psychoanalytic love) has to re-enter the skull he lived in in the book.)  There are a few changes, in other words.

The first episode is worth two stars, and I put the DVD on my shelf and forgot about it until I'd finished every Dresden book out there.  Now that I'm back, I'm glad I've continued through a few more episodes and I encourage you to do the same.",1225497600,,884,4.670967741935484

2845659,5,B000QUEQ4U,"THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, and sadly, the only season, are based on the novels by Jim Butcher.  I love Jim Butcher's novels and Harry Dresden.  While not an exact adaptation of Butcher's well-beloved series, THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON are still a lot of fun and well worth watching.

I have always thought of this series as a kind of Harry Potter meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Charmed meets X-Files meets Sam Spade.  And somehow, that weird and wonderful combination just works.  These shows have great atmosphere.  The cinematography is clearly inspired by 1940s film noire.  The colors are just muted enough to send you back in time to that era.  The acting is great.  Paul Blackthorne is an inspired choice to play our favorite wizard, Harry.  Rough around the edges, sarcastic humor, tongue-in-cheek wit, world-weary voice, always fighting for the underdog, Blackthorne captures Harry to a tee.  Now, whenever I read the books, I hear Blackthorne's voice in my head.  That is a good thing.  Terrence Mann is first-rate as Bob, the skull in Harry's basement.  Mann is another excellent choice, as put upon and droll as Butcher wrote.  But here, Bob's spirit can manifest outside of the skull, which is good for us.  We get to really see the interactions and the bond between Harry and Bob.  This is a definite plus, dare I say an improvement from the books.  Something like an animated skull would not have worked nearly as well.  The rest of the cast are equally good, committed to their roles and to the series.  They make it all work, and add to the audience's enjoyment of these shows.

The plots are loosely based on different excerpts from various early Dresden books.  They are a little less dark, a little less gruesome, and a lot simpler, but still captivating mystery stories, enthralling detective stories, and entertaining supernatural stories.  All rolled into one.  This series is definitely a keeper.  To bad Sci Fi didn't think so.  Perhaps THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON are destined to become a cult classic.",1220140800,,2090,4.833333333333333

2845662,5,B000QUEQ4U,"For any Dresden book fans who see the reviews here panning the T.V. show for its comparison to the books, just remember the impotent crybaby outrage over Peter Jackson's LOTR. The dozens of those folks vs. box office numbers. Seriously folks, it's just more Dresden, how could that be wrong.",1219017600,,291,4.84
2845663,1,B000QUEQ4U,"First, let it be known that I own and have read ALL of the ""Dresden Files"" books. Now when I heard that quite possibly my favorite book series was being made into a TV show I was excited. Then I heard it was being made by Sci-Fi channel and I immediately had doubts. As it turns out those doubts were well founded. Sci-Fi channel took a great thing and turned it into another piece of primetime trash. But enough bashing Sci-Fi and their grave mistake that has made me lose what little confidence I had left in them.

The TV show of ""Dresden Files"" has an innumerable amount of glaring problems. First and foremost they're with Harry, the sarcastic and ever cynical wizard-protagonist.
First and foremost with Harry is that his wizarding gear has been dumbed down into the everyday. He carries a hockey stick with engraved runes as his staff and a drumstick as his blasting-rod. Seriously, how much worse can it get? Harry's trademark duster has been replaced by an almost mundane leather jacket. The unstoppable warhorse known by ""real"" fans of the ""Dresden Files"" as the Blue Beetle has been replaced by a 1940's era ARMY surplus Jeep.
Second, Bob. Bob has been a source for hilarity since the beginning of the ""Storm Front"" novel. You don't get much more comedic than a sex-addicted air spirit living in a skull trading refuge from one of the Queens of the Sidhe for a repository of knowledge. He's the wizardly equivalent of a computer. In the TV series, Bob has been replaced by a former human wizard who appears occasionally talking in his stuck up English accent and fancy duds. Not a shred of the Bob that Jim Butcher readers have come to love.
Third, some of the extra characters in the story. Murphy is completely different than who she is in the book. Not the short, cute, blone tough-chick cop we know and love. She's replaced by this brunette single mom trying to be tough in a man's world, with wizards. Anyone else see the problem? Morgan, Harry's would-be executioner and rival (for lack of a better term) in the novels is described as a man with an almost Will Riker-esque look. Now ""Affirmative Action"" replaced him with a minority-Morgan who makes people feel better about themselves by making Harry's life a living hell. Billy the Werewolf and the 'Alphas' are not to be heard of. Ancient Mai, who only makes 2 real appearences in the books, is the one who's trying to get Harry convicted of black magic and killed (and in coincidently a very unsavory character herself). That's just the tip of the iceberg.
Fourth, I could go on and on about how watered down and bad the story is. However that would take up too much time and could probably provoke me into a rant. They screwed the story and watered down the plot until it was almost quite well unrecognizable.

If you're a fan of the book series of the ""Dresden Files"" then do yourself a favor and don't even bother to think about watching this series. It's a horrible flop that Sci-Fi's fans who don't have half a brain seem to clamour over. For those of us with intelligence, skip it.",1218758400,23,3058,4.578467153284672
2845664,5,B000QUEQ4U,"OK, look - this is not a true adaptation from the books - not by any means.  But, so what?  The acting is fun, the stories fine, and the series gets better as it goes along.  Sure, a few more special effects would have been nice, and I miss some of the witty dialogue and ""edge"" of the books, but this is a fine job.  I missed it when it first ran on TV, and seeing the series now - I can't understand why it did not get a second and third season - seems to have had really good potential.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.  No gratuitous violence, little blood, should be fine for anyone over 7-8 in my opinion.",1217635200,4,614,3.9918032786885247

The bad thing in the series is that everything has been toned down so badly from the books that you can't distinguish this from Supernatural or American Gothic or G. Vs. E or ten other shows that dealt with the supernatural.

The good things of the series are
1. Bob just looks cool
2. Its great to see Harry in action no matter the venue.
3. Morgan is not portrayed as an overzealous enforcer for the council just an other worked  one

Dresden is the current survivor in a family that had various supernatural powers but he was also bedeviled by his complicated history involving the murder of his father and his brief step into ""black magic"" to take revenge. He helps the police, particularly a very likable and watchable detective by the name of Murphy, and others in an ongoing attempt to make payment for his unwise use of the dark arts.

The one good thing about this show is that it made me start reading Butcher's incredibly fun and entertaining novels, something that essentially the tv show did not capture. This show took alot of liberties with Butcher's Dresdenverse and in some cases made outright changes to the characters themselves. I personally am happy to see the show go away, and my hope is that eventually someone will come along and write (maybe Butcher himself) a suitable screenplay that truly captures his vision. Maybe one day it will make it to the big screen.

I like the books but sometimes find them so thickly populated (for small volumes) that it's difficult to sort them out.

Believe it or not, this is one occassion where film makers actually improved some aspects of the characters in the series as opposed to what you imagined from the books.

It is good solid entertainment, and I hope it inspires people to read the books, get on the computer and write for the resurrection of the series.  Remember people-everyone thought the original Star Trek was history after its first season too...and look where that went.

The actor portraying Dresden does an OK job but just does not fit the character physically.  Bob I am also disappointed with.  I love the talking skull.  Susan and Murphy are all wrong too.  The writing for the story of the show has been good, and I would recommend this DVD series if you can stray yourself away from what was written.

There is an on-going story that develops concerning the past of this character, and how he ended up in a store=front operation, advertising as a wizard. He works with a local police woman and solves crimes (or problems for clients) related to the supernatural (demons, soul suckers, vampires, that sort of thing).

He has a great side kick - ""Bob"" who is a hundreds of years old ghost and he helps Harry with some trickier magical dilemmas.

I never read Jim Butcher's novels but for those who like to associate story with image, ""The Dresden Files"" has all the ingredients that make you happy to have sat in your couch to watch this well-cast series. Paul Blackthorne (Harry Dresden) convinces as a calm, resourceful wizard, with his bag of tricks always surprising you and helped by the special effects people. Valerie Cruz is Harry's good looking- without- overwhelming police detective who is wise enough to take recourse to Harry when her cases become too hairy for her to solve on her own. And last, but not least,Terrence Mann's ghost-out-of-a-skull is delightful as a complement to Dresden resources. Add to this a number of well chosen female guest stars who show up in almost every episode and you have a delightful series that is delicious to watch. It is the type of series that should remain on the screen for years, for several seasons and somehow it's gone. To a foreigner like me, the logic of North-American TV business personalities is quite baffling and suffice it to say that they should know that a great majority of viewers shall miss Harry Dresden and consider his one of the most untimely deaths of any TV season.

When SciFi ran the series, apparently it didn't reach the 'target audience' and so it was yanked after 1 season.  Keeping in mind that no movie/TV series is going to duplicate the books they're based on, it was still entertaining to watch.  Many of the little nuances that made the books so enjoyable have been omitted. I gather the cameras would not fit into a VW Bug, so instead of the blue beetle, we have to substitute a vehicle with little to no character.  Instead of remaining steadfast to 1 woman, it seems like half the episodes show Harry in bed with yet another fly by nite girl.  Many of the peripheral characters did not show up or were basically glossed over, and I didn't care much for Bob being a ghost - I missed his perverted nature, and most of the sarcastic humor was omitted as well.

2845733,5,B000QUEQ4U,"The Dresden Files was one of the best Science Fiction series ever
produced.  I personally rank every episode with the best Star Trek
episodes or any other series for that matter.  Each story has thrill,
mystery and cast with great chemistry.  Unfortunately SiFi
never advertised it, as a result it flew under the radar until the
last few episodes.  Despite this dereliction, the Dreden Files has
accumulated a large following.  I have shown Dresden episodes from the
DVD to several non-SiFi viewers and have them hooked.  Whenever we pop
a DVD in, they now want to watch ""another Dresden"".  The Dresden Files
was a huge success, SiFi's ability to recognize this, market it and
put in an appropriate time slot were a failure.  I still hope to see
it return.",1207526400,2,756,4.7615384615384615

2845735,4,B000QUEQ4U,"Judge this series on its own merits, not by comparing it to the books. They definitely took liberties when converting it to television. However, I liked most of the liberties they took, especially what they did with Bob by giving him an incorporeal body.

The reasons I gave this four stars instead of five is that they should have kept the pilot as a pilot instead of chopping it into an hour show and broadcasting it as I believe the eighth episode, and I think they probably oversimplified it by aiming it at the wrong audience.

My answer to most of the single-star reviews is that the Dresden Files was converted to television and could not possibly be exactly like the books so they took some artistic license with it. If you don't like the way they made changes, maybe you should go do it yourself instead of complaining about the way somebody else does it. At least they had the gumption to do something with it.",1206662400,2,920,4.502994011976048
2845736,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I find it interesting that all of the one star reviews comment on the series straying from what takes place in the books. If people look at some of the comments Jim Butcher has written about the show they would see that it is not meant to line up perfectly that the show is an alternate universe (for lack of a better word) than that of the book.

Although I really would have liked to see Dresden get around in an awful dilapidated VW Bug and would have liked to see Billy and his crew on the show, the series was none the less fantastic. Bob became one of my favorite characters since it is easier to become attached to something with ghost than a disembodied cloud that lives in a skull on Harry's shelf. Sadly like many worthwhile shows Sci-Fi no longer wishes let the company that produced the movie make another season. The company seems to be willing according to the various petitions going around the net if anyone is interested in signing one of them.",1205107200,4,961,4.398876404494382

2845739,3,B000QUEQ4U,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the books.  I own them all and think that they're some of the best fantasy books that I've read in the last decade.  They're really *that good*.

I was tremendously excited when I heard that Dresden was going to be made into a tv series.  I desperately wanted it to be successful.  I wanted to be entertained on a weekly basis in the same way that the Dresden books entertained me once a year.

Wow, was I disappointed when the tv series came out.  OK, so the first show wasn't that great, I told myself.  Much of the wit and charm of the books was missing.  The story wasn't very involved.  It's unfair to judge a series from one show, I told myself -- be open minded, maybe it'll get better.

After watching the next 4 or so shows I finally gave up on the series.  The plots remained bland, they took too many liberties with established characters (Bob no longer a skull, Murphy lost her strong, feisty, proud nature, even Dresden was just *different*).

So take my review for what it's worth -- I only saw the first 5 episodes or so before retreating back to the books.  Some of the differences are surely due to the 43 minutes that shows find themselves limited to while the books have many hundreds of pages to tell their intricate stories.  Other differences are undoubtedly due to things like private thoughts and in-depth musings that don't translate well to TV stories.

But for whatever the reason, I thought the TV series was very mediocre and failed to capture the wit, charm, and style that makes the books so wonderful.

I for one am not sorry to see it go.",1203465600,2,1617,4.37248322147651

It took a friend to tell me of this show and that it was out on DVD...so I bought it and well less than 48 hours later I watched all the shows.

It's the only one that wasn't a Fox product.  Considering it was a Canadian production, the theatrical value was great.  If I was a industry big-wig, I'd hire those responsible...",1202428800,2,312,4.327586206896552
2845744,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I remember catching every single episode of The Dresden Files when it aired on the SciFi channel, and I became hooked at the very first episode. So when I saw that it had been released on DVD, I had to buy it. And it was great to see every episode again, with no commercials. Not only that, but there was a great featurette that came with it. It was nice to see such an invested cast and team of designers. Jim Butcher's novels are great, and this show does them justice.

Sadly, I feel that it was sent to an early grave, much like Angel not getting a 6th season, Firefly not even getting to finish its first or allowed to go on to a 2nd. The Dresden Files is one of the best shows on the air. SciFi channel's made for TV movies are laughable, but their TV series (Stargate SG-1, the new Battlestar Galactica) are absolutely amazing. The Dresden Files is no exception; it is right up there with the best of them! I only wish the 2 hour Stormfront movie had been on here, but I'll be glad to buy it if it comes to DVD later.",1202169600,5,1024,4.12

so quickly?
 Surprise! It was cancelled after only one season.
 The only reason I could see for its being dropped
is low ratings. aka low viewership.
 So bought it and was plesantly surprise at how good the show was.
Paul Blackthorn is excellent in the role of the gumshoe wizard!
 and the british actor who plays a supernatural version of his girl friday. is also very good. Harry Dresden is sort of a Sam Spade of the

I tried watching this when it first came out and hated it...mainly cause I was SO shocked at the watered down version of the books...so watered down as to be ALMOST but not quite unrecognizalbe.  I have since tried watching it again and if I watch it on its own merit and forget the brilliant books it was based on...well there are STILL glaring problems, but these could have been overcome as with any new series kinks have to be worked out.  I think it could have continued to grow and become even better.  I actually enjoy it on its own merit.  I think Sci Fi is extrememly stupid to take such a promising premise, ruin it, and then not even give it a decent chance.  It really was a promising, well made show....too bad sci fi isn't as promising anymore...guess it isn't worth their time if it isn't really stupid and dumbed down.",1199318400,9,957,4.283333333333333

The first couple episodes are kinda weak, but I think that's mainly 'cause they were aired out of order (Storm Front is episode 8, but obviously the intended pilot).
The cast is great, though don't expect them to mimic the characters in the books. I think this was a smart move, letting the actors and writers expand on the initial ideas created by Jim Butcher's novels.
I know fans of the book still hate this series, but I for one am sucked in by it's charm. It's good fun and much more lively than the books have ever been.",1199232000,2,763,4.268965517241379

Unfortunately, the downfall of this series was the Sci-Fi Network. They have a track record of killing shows and this is another perfect example of it.

If you are a fan of the books then I highly recommend the DVDs but you need to take into account that the series doesn't exactly follow the books. Regardless, I highly highly recommend this series on DVD. It's truly sad that it was only given one season on TV.

This addictive series had at least a few more seasons worth of stories in it, and--judging at how good this, the first season was--I'm sure things would have just kept getting better and better.  But, alas, we're left with one twelve episode season.

I've never read an entire ""Dresden"" book.  I can see you readers going to vote this review as ""unhelpful"" right now, but I urge you to wait a second.  I've read one of Jim' Butcher's short stories featuring Harry Dresden, which was remarkable, and I am currently waiting to receive the first book in the mail (I'm anal about having my collection in only hardcover, and the book was just release for the first time in that format).  I don't have much prior knowledge of the Dresden-verse to base my interpretation of the show on, and I think that my review, because of that, shall be as unbiased as any you'll find here.

The mythology of here is great; Harry's powers are never used to cop out of a tricky plot line, only to supply interesting twists in the story.  Each episode will keep you on your toes, urging you to try to figure out the mystery along with Harry, which--seeing as Harry isn't only a wizard, he's also a good detective and pretty much a hero--you likely won't be able to.  While each episode is a standalone monster-of-the-week type story, the interactions and development BETWEEN the characters (specifially between Harry and Bob, as well as Harry and Murphy) becomes the over-arching storyarc of the season.

The choice to make Bob appear as a visual ghost instead of a disembodied voice coming from a skull (as he does in the books) was an intelligent one.  Bob's situation and his reflections on it make for some of the most dramatic and emotional moments this series has to offer.  And speaking of those teary little moments, the fact that this show never shied away from the soft-side of Harry was one of the best things about this show; they were willing to focus on the characters as much as the mythology, and that made the show better.

I did have a few minor quibbles, though: The pilot, ""Storm Front,"" was filmed before Bob was cast, and also back before some major changes were made.  The placement of this episode in the middle of the series was mind-boggling, in that it felt as if it took place long before the series.  There's no Bob in the episode, it appears Harry is operating out of a different place, and he's in love with a girl who isn't mentioned for the rest of the series.  If only a few scenes had been re shot, the episode would have fit into continuity so much better.  And, not to hate on Paul Blackthorn, who I truly loved as Harry Dresden, but sometimes his American accent (he's a British actor) didn't sound quite right.  I have to stress though, for the most part, I think he did a wonderful job.

I was going to end this review with a list of the best episodes, but as soon as I started to pick out the standouts, I realized that there was something that I loved about all of them.  If forced to, I'd say the last two episodes of the series were when the acting, writing, and directing were the strongest, but I'd rather just recommend watching the entire series.  Unfortunately, it didn't last long.  ""The Dresden Files"" was truly cancelled before it's time.

2845801,4,B000QUEQ4U,"I have been reading the books by Jim Butcher which the Sci Fi channel's series is based off of. Although there are some major differences from the books, the tv show holds true to the basic storyline. If you have seen the show, I highly recommend the books, and vice-versa. It is nice seeing the characters from the books come to life. The first book, ""Storm Front"", is part of the first season.

Dresden talks of his father in the books and the show does flashbacks so you get to see the interaction between Harry as a child and his dad.

Some things that I didn't like were that his apartment is completely differnt in the show (no sub-basement lab and his office is in the front part of his living space) and he drives a jeep cherokee instead of the beat up ""Blue Beetle"" which isn't really blue anymore since many body panels have been replace.

Also, Justin DuMorne was Harry's mentor/teacher in the books after his father died, not a relative. In the show, the guy's name is Justin Morningway and is portrayed as Harry's uncle (mothers brother).

2845804,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I wasn't a fan of Butcher's Dresden books. I thought they were clumsily written and uninspired. So when I first heard of The Dresden Files TV show, I thought, ""I'll pass.""

When I bought a new iPod and visited the iTunes store to see what I could download, I saw The Dresden Files. This time I thought, ""It's only $1.99 for the first episode. Why not?""

I watched it in bed one night, my little ear buds in and the iPod screen about six inches from my face. I was mesmerized. Something about the show really clicked with me.

The next morning I told my wife about it. ""I know you're going to think I'm nuts, but I really liked The Dresden Files. I watched and episode last night. It was compelling and well acted. It had an air of magic about it, and not because it's a show about a wizard who has a shop in Chicago.""

We found The Dresden Files DVD set at a local store and bought it.

For the last couple of weeks, we've watched an episode a night, totally engrossed. Completely hooked.

We haven't seen a show this well done in many years. It's on par with LOST for its believable, smart, witty characters. It's on par with Buffy the Vampire Slayer for its otherworldly milieu.

Everything about the show, from its setting in Chicago (actually filmed in Toronto, but it looks like Chicago, one of my favorite cities) to its hapless lead character, a wizard named Harry Dresden, to its cast of fascinating supporting characters (Bob, the ghost who lives in his skull, Murphy, the attractive but smart police woman, and many others) is first-rate. This is an extraordinary television series.

Which can only mean one thing: It got canceled.

Apparently, the morons at the Sci-Fi Channel didn't pick up the series for a second season. I'm not even sure it was given the chance to have a complete first season since there are only 12 episodes in this DVD set. Why a network wouldn't want a show this exceptional is beyond me.

But The Dresden Files is in very good company. Consider Firefly, the brilliant sci-fi Western created by Joss Whedon. FOX was the moronic network that time, dropping it after less than 14 episodes. or consider Carnivale, the jaw-dropping series axed by HBO after two seasons.

I've never figured out why networks are so stupid. They complain ad revenues are down, along with viewership. Yet, they cancel the shows that are the most well done and best loved. It makes no sense at all. I wish I could be in charge of a network, just for a week. I wouldn't ax any shows. I'd ax the axers, get rid of every MBA bean-counting suit who wouldn't know a well-made show if it drove up next to his Bimmer at a stop light.

Anyway, The Dresden Files is superb. The dialog is witty. The characters are the most ""real"" and believable I've ever seen in a TV series. And the stories are compelling.

I can't recommend The Dresden Files highly enough. Please do yourself a favor and buy the DVD set of the first season before it's out of print.",1194652800,25,2954,4.4684014869888475
2845805,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Well there is good new and bad news for fans of Harry Dresden. The good news is that the complete first season of the Sci-Fi Channel TV show is now on DVD. The bad news is that it looks like it will be the ONLY season on DVD. The dim-witted executives of the network have evidently decided to cancel the series after just one season. Apparently they need more room on their schedule for Star Trek reruns, professional wrestling, and movies about giant snakes and bugs. Let me get this straight...Dresden is canceled after one season yet we get a second season of Who Wants to be a Superhero? This is why the Sci-Fi channel continues to be the most under-performing network in existence.

This three-disc set contains all twelve episodes and a smattering of special features. The show is based on a very successful series of fantasy/mystery novels by Jim Butcher. Set in Chicago, Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne) is a wizard-for-hire...you can even find him in the Yellow Pages. This is an urban landscape populated by vampires, werewolves, demons, and both good and evil wizards. Dresden is frequently called on for assistance by beautiful police lieutenant Connie Murphy (Valerie Cruz), to help solve bizarre cases that deal with the supernatural. Murphy is a skeptic, but she also knows that Dresden gets results. Harry is frequently aided and advised by the spirit of a long deceased wizard named Bob (Terrence Mann), who normally resides inside his own skull, which Harry owns.

The TV series doesn't get into as much detail as the books of course, but some of Butcher's various factions do find their way into the show such as the White Council, or High Council, who is the governing body for wizards in the world. There are also various groups of rival vampire clans such as the Red Court and Black Court.

In the pilot episode, ""Birds of a Feather"", a middle-school boy wants to hire Harry because he thinks that monsters are after him. Harry dismisses it as a kid's over-active imagination. However, when Murphy calls in Harry to help with a murder case of a woman skinned alive, Harry realizes the boy's claims were no joke.

""Storm Front"" is based on Butcher's first novel of the same name. A pair of lovers are found dead with their hearts ripped from their chests. Exploded out of their chests is more accurate and Harry knows only one thing could have done this...black magic. The High Council suspects that Harry is the murderer and sends their chief Warden Morgan to keep an eye on him. Harry has to find out who committed the murders and how before the crime is pinned on him. This was the only book in the series that I've actually read and although it's a very condensed version, I thought it was a very strong adaptation of the book.

In ""Bad Blood"", the beautiful vampire nightclub owner, Bianca, comes to Harry for help after an attempt is made on her life. She thinks the High Council is responsible. When the Council's assassination squad is wiped out, they blame Bianca and Harry finds himself trapped between the two parties with no hope of compromise.

I've mentioned only a handful of the episodes but there really isn't a bad episode in the dozen. Those who have read all the books may pick apart some of the details but one has to allow for poetic license for TV. Paul Blackthorne is superb as Harry because he isn't your typical, pretty boy leading man. He plays the character in reserved fashion, staying within the role and never chewing scenery. That is reserved for Terrence Mann whose dry sarcasm provides some comic relief as the spirit, Bob. This is a show that would have had very strong appeal to fans of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, had Sci-Fi given it a bit more time. Truly a shame.

I expected something similar to the books in the show and found it was not there.  It would have been nice to know that this TV series was based on the books, and only loosely at best.  Paul Blackthorne, although a good actor, does not carry the persona of Harry Dresden, it just doesn't work.  Second, I'm sorry but Murphy is described as being a petite blond warrior, not a somewhat tall, petulant, brunette.  I was also looking forward to seeing Mouse.  The other continuity issues I had were Harry's apartment being completely wrong, the blue bettle being missing, and Bob.

The Sci Fi series was incredible and I was very disappointed that there wasn't going to be a second season.  My suggestion is to snap up this DVD before it runs out!  And in addition...check out the books by Jim Butcher!  The main character, Harry Dresden, is a wizard that's as real as it gets...Chicago real!",1193529600,7,586,4.330275229357798

I haven't had time to read the last three or four books in the series, but I loved all of the works prior to the aforementioned unread ones.  I had looked forward to watching the Sci-Fi TV series version, but couldn't watch it live and awaited the DVD with anticipation.  It sucks that the series was cancelled.  It is one of the best fantasy shows out there, and in spite of the predictable changes they made to the show, it was still enjoyable.  The special effects were better than most and the storylines were dark and entertaining.  Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne) is a bit cooler and darker than the book version -- kind of a supernatural James Bond.  (And why is his staff a hockey stick or a drumstick?)  But, like in the book, he has his fair share of inner demons and complexities, which made him an interesting character in this one as well.  Valerie Cruz does a good job as Murphy, Joanne Kelly is just how I pictured vampire Bianca to be, and Morgan (Conrad Coates) is pretty good too (though he wasn't black in the book).  I really like Terrence Mann as Bob.  In the series, he takes human form, whereas in the book he literally talks from a skull, but I can see that this change is necessary for the show.  Due to the show's abrupt cancellation, the show never reached its potential, and we didn't get to see other characters, like Michael and Thomas.  Sci-Fi should have given this one a chance.  It could have become a sleeper hit.  Alas, at least I get to keep this awesome DVD, and I still have the book series to enjoy.  If you're a fan of Jim Butcher's beloved series, you ought to give this DVD a whirl.  Thank goodness for Netflix!",1193529600,4,1702,4.386581469648562

I'm hoping this series comes back with more episodes.  Based on the novels by J.Butcher.  Harry  Dresden is a wizard for higher in Chicago.  His sidekick is a ghost with an attitude named Bob, a damned spirit attached to a skull for all eternity.  (There's a story within a story here.)

Harry has a relationship developing with a detective in the police department.  Add lesbian vampires, were-wolves, and Chicago's most extreme.

It excites me to see the damsel saving our man in distress, a nice switch.  I liked the reporter, but they only had her in one episode.  Harry gets beat up in every episode.

I love Harry's apartment.  Modern gadgetry is allergic to Harry's powers.  He has to use a rotary phone. (remember those?)

2845835,4,B000QUEQ4U,"A good series but will it be better as a movie...I think so...O Yea!

Good...Better...Best!

Paul Blackthorne as Harry Dresden... not bad.

Clive Owen as Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden - Ooom...perfect!
(Especially if his roll play is anything like Mr. Smith in Shoot `Em Up.)

Now that they don't want to continue the series, why not make a movie and get Clive Owen to play our hero, Harry...Yum!

They should keep all the good supporting characters though.  Dresden files is just not the same without our gangster man Johnny Marcone, sweet Ebenezer (Blackstaff - assassin for White council and Harry's mentor), adorable Mouse (Temple dog), Thomas (Harry's sexy vamp brother), Murphy (button nosed blond), Michael, The White Council (hardcore old guys), Winter (Queen Mab), Summer (Summer lady) and Vampire Courts, the wolf gang and...my favourite the pizza eating fairies.

This is an excellent story that really needs the correct director to bring it across from book format to this vibrant medium.

I was very disappointed in the series since the main characters that make the story so interesting was missing.

I was especially disappointed when they did not show the part where Harry confronts Marconi in the club and he says ""Little pig, little pig let me in"" after he blows the doors apart.  That so Cool! It's the thing that got me hooked to Butchers book in the first place.  Kind of like the catch phrase ""I'll be back"" that sticks in your head each time you look at a scary movie.

The best part about Harry in the book was the images you get when he uses his shield bracelet. In the series the shield goes and physically go out and stop each bullet etc sent Harry's way, it should instead create an invisible kinetic force field per his wishes e.g. in front of him; all around him etc. and then this invisible force shield shows when something hits it (I really wanted a good semi-automatic gun seen here, but alas...).

I know the series can't be like the book exactly but although the series is not a total loss; ... please ... I would really like to see the second season; wherein they actually used some of the interesting characters Jim Butcher created, maybe even have a sub plot through the whole series that you can follow e.g. Harry facing off against Outsiders? (Maybe begin the new series where he fights the one who walks behind while a teenager, like a suppressed memory in his adult life)

Why are they using flash backs of Harry's father so much; because it's not working.  Are they trying to imitate Dexter?  They should have used flashbacks with Ebenezer more since Harry received his moral upbringing when he was fostered with the Black staff (Assassin for the White council).",1192147200,,2713,4.764957264957265

2845838,4,B000QUEQ4U,"There was so much about The Dresden Files that appealed to me. I like noir-ish detective stuff and fantasy fiction. This show crossed them both perfectly and offered an interesting new story with every episode. So what do the execs at the Sci-Fi Channel do? They cancel it. And it's not because the rating were low either. It was because they were not reaching the correct demographic. What IS the correct demographic exactly?

The show revolves around a wizard named Harry...Dresden; a Chicago-based Private Eye. He helps out the police with their bizarre, head-scratching cases without ever revealing his powers. Armed with a hockey stick sceptre and a drumstick wand, his methods occasionally rouse The High Council, the magical governors who are always weary of Harry since he used Black Magic to kill his uncle.

It can be accused to ripping-off anything from CSI, Buffy, Charmed or even Law & Order, but I think that The Dresden Files stood well on its own two feet. The cold, wintry (often Xmasy) feel to the show and the naturalised look sits well with the supernatural element and there is a dynamic range of characters. Though my favorite has to be Bob (Hrothbert of Bainbridge), the ghost of a gentlemanly wizard cursed to live the rest of eternity inside his own skull when he's not helping Harry with his latest case. He's played by Terrance Mann, who you may remember as Johnny Steele, singing 'Power of the Night' in the original Critters movie.

I am sad that The Dresden Files never made it past a single series. But I will surely be checking out the books that they are based on in the future.

The show is presented on DVD in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras are plentiful.",1191715200,4,1717,4.751677852348993

2845905,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I didn't know what to expect from The Dresden Files.  I'd never read any of the books, didn't even really know that they existed (which was my loss and I've quickly corrected that little mistake).  So I went into this show with my eyes and mind wide open.

What I found was a wonderful show that mixed magic and a detective/crime drama quite well.  Harry, named after Houdini not Potter, is a Wizard in Chicago.  He consults with the Chicago PD's 'Special Investigation' unit and more specifically, he works for and with Lt. Karen Murphy.  Not all the cops like him or even trust him or believe in his power, but Murphy does and that's enough for Dresden.

In the first episode, we see a young Harry on the road with his dad, a traveling magician or 'stage' magician who does the kind of magic that's really only slight of hand and misdirection.  We learn that his mother died when he was very young and that Harry, well, Harry has real power.  We're introduced to the characters one by one and we learn a little bit about Harry's world; first up is 'Bob', the ghost of a thousand year old wizard who was cursed to spend eternity in his own skull.  He's sort of a repository of arcane knowledge and Harry's teacher.

Next up is Murphy; a no nonsense cop who sees a lot of things that can't be explained, which is when she calls Dresden to come and explain it.  She closes cases but she's not happy about the explanations when they are more supernatural than natural.

Later on in the series we meet Morgan, a Warden of the Council whose mission in life is to catch Harry breaking the Laws so he can end that life once and for all.

I like the pacing of the show, the writing, the jokes (Bob: ""Perhaps the boy left some snot on the table at the diner.  What?  Where there's children there's snot.""  Murphy's dad: ""So a 'Wizard' huh?  Let me guess - last year you were a 'Jedi'?"").  Considering that Robert Hewitt Wolfe (Star Trek:  The Next Generation, Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine, Gene Roddenberry's: Andromeda) it doesn't surprise me that the show was so well done.

The show is fun, the characters full of depth, the stories intriguing and interesting.  They catch your attention and entertain.

NOW - having said that - I will add that if you have read the Dresden books by Jim Butcher, you may not care for this show.  A lot changes from the books to the show.  A LOT.

I am not a fan of Hollywood changing things 'for the better' - I've ranted (elsewhere) about that before.  Harry from the books is different from Harry in the show.  For one thing, in the books it takes him a very long time to come clean to Murphy about some of the stuff going on with magic, the Council, the Red Court, so on and etc.  In the show, the pacing has to be different.  His girlfriend Susan makes only one appearance and then is gone (I actually think that episode was the original pilot as it followed a part of the plot of 'Storm Front' pretty well) - in the books, Harry actually pops the question to her (right after some bad er, 'people' make bad stuff happen that I won't spoil if you wanna read the books).  Bob from the book, a spirit living in a skull because Harry is protecting him from some bad stuff in the NeverNever, becomes the ghost of a Wizard in the tv series because they just didn't know how to do a talking skull and have it be cost effective.  The Alpha's from the books, a group of young college men and women who are Werewolves and who try to help Harry whenever he'll let them never once make an appearance in the show.  Neither does the Knight, Michael, who helps Dresden quite a lot with the Vampies and the Sidhe.

IF you are looking for a fun, different and intriguing show then I suggest you pick up The Dresden Files.  If you want an excellent and compelling new series of books to read, then I suggest you pick up 'Storm Front' and go from there.  If you want BOTH - start with the show first.  If you read the books first, I just don't think you will be happy with the show.",1189209600,3,3995,4.305630026809651

I actually liked the characters in the show, their appearance and character probably more than in the novels.

Paul Blackthorne does a great job of portraying the Harry Dresden of Jim Butcher's books. I can easily hear Blackthorne's voice as I am reading the books despite the fact he is British. (That's two actors - the other being Hugh Laurie - that do a great American accent.)

Yes, it was canceled. And while maybe it didn't stick with the books and while maybe it was a little cheesy and underfunded, it didn't really have a chance.
And THIS IS WHAT THE SCI-FI CHANNEL IS ALL ABOUT!!!!
It's a heck of a lot better than Sasquatch Mountain, no?
We're going to lose BattleStar pretty soon, so then what?
If we want Sci-Fi, we have to show them that this is what we want, we have to show them with money.
So if you liked the show at all and want to see more shows like this, buy this DVD!

(P.S. It was an excellent show, in my opinion, as a Sci-Fi and Fantasy aficionado. Much more than we can really hope for in TV shows other than cheesy ones about vampires who are 13. But you can read the other good reviews which do a much better job of talking about it's good and bad points than I can.)",1188950400,4,949,4.047872340425532

But i do know that i have enjoyed each and every episode on Sci Fi channel and now again with the First Season DVD set...kind of weird that's cancelled.  But it has First Season on the set...weird.  But i really enjoy the various characters in the show.  Harry Dresden with all the issues, drama and back story past that most wouldn't even believe.  Wizard for hire and detective as well neither are where he wants to be but, hey it pays ok and with all the weirdness: monsters, dragons, vampires, skinwalkers and various other weird as hell things that do more than bump in the night.  They body slam you to sleep.  I love his character because it's played with not with a sense of oh i'm important.  It's more like i'm a wizard...dang it isn't there anything else.  But he accepts it and goes out to protect those in of protecting..big city and all that.

I also like Bob and what he brings as well being someone without a body for having raised someone that he loved from the dead.  It got him a nice little one way trip to the neighbor skull where he resides and comes out whenever Harry needs him...many times when he doesn't.  I just enjoy his character and how knowledgable he is and is always there helping out Harry even when we think he isn't like (in one episode).  Also Murphy who at first doesnt want to hear anything Harry has to say about the weirdness going on.  She doesnt want to be bothered with it...to weird and all that.  But as the season progresses she believes a bit more with each occurence and several that happen to her that kind of force her to see.  Dresden isn't some no talent hack out there exploiting people's fears weird crap is going and i need to be down with the guy that can help me solve some of this madness.

I also enjoyed the other actors/actresses in the series as well.  The guests were cool as well such as Claudia Black.  I can't help but think what could've and should've been for this series...yet again another series that i find myself getting attached to and loving, wanting to see each week getting cancelled..yet again (ratings anyone).  I'm just glad that i have this on DVD and hope that by some miracle the Dresden Files is renewed by another network if possible.  I would love to see this go and progress into something outstanding.

Features on last disc include commentary on ""Things That Go Bump"" and a making of Featurette which is interesting in of itself.  It shows you how they came up with the various characters involved in the show.

Kudos to the actors/actresses/directors and everyone else involved with this show. A fan for life right here.",1188432000,5,2678,4.485537190082645
2845925,2,B000QUEQ4U,"Now that the show is officially cancelled (08/03/07), it seems time to put a wrap on matters.

I really loved the first four Harry Dresden books; I have grown less enamoured with the later volumes, although the most recent one has gotten back to his ""roots"" (less Saving The World, more acting like a detective with magic).  I watched the first show of this series, eager in my hopes for it because Jim Butcher had put so much hope on it as well.

I was very disappointed.

Sure, books and movies/shows are not the same.  Heck, I wasn't excepting that they would do any of the books straight over as plots for the series -- actually I was kind of hoping against it.  Be that as may be, I was appalled, as a lover of the books, at what I saw.

Harry is fine.  Murph ... is wrong.  She is not cute-n-tough, but just tough (and when did a child come in to the picture for her?).  Bob bothered me at first for showing up ... but that wore off and then I got annoyed because he was nothing like Bob!  Where were all the wisecracks?  Where were the demands for romance novels and the havoc he wrecked upon sorority houses?  Where was his wisdom?

And then there was Morgan...

Instead of being a rather thick, battle-hardened, utterly-by-the-books, tough as nails guy with a huge sword, he was a suave, sophisticated politico.

No, beyond Harry, none of the characters felt right to me.  The plots were often nonsensical, but this can be chalked up to massive last-minute re-editing (bad move, studio!).  The connection with the books was so weak as to be demoralizing.

So the show never found an audience and, despite being underbudget, SciFi decided to can the series in favour of Flash Gordon before the show had a chance to build an audience of its own.

So, The Dresden Files is gone.

Rest in peace.",1188432000,3,1800,4.443425076452599
2845926,5,B000QUEQ4U,"""The Dresden Files"" is not, for those interested, a direct translation of Jim Butcher's books into a television series.  Rather, the characters and ideas of the Harry Dresden, Wizard for Hire books have been taken and - in my opinion - brilliantly used as background to create mostly completely new stories for the television series.  (The only ones I noted that were closely related to any books were the werewolf episode and the skinwalker episode, and even those were only loosely based on the original books).  There are a great many changes made in order to make the series more ""watchable,"" I suppose - it has already been mentioned that Bob is given a ghostly body, and I absolutely LOVE what they have done with him. The actor playing Bob - Terrence Mann - is a brilliant actor and brings charm and class to the role.  Harry, alas, does not drive the Blue Beetle, although in one episode we see him working on it.  Rather he drives a dilapidated old Jeep.  Also, rather than having a snazzy staff and blasting rod, he carries around a hockey stick and a drum stick for a wand - I thought this was even weirder than carrying a staff, if you ask me.  A cane would have been better, but *shrug*  Michael is conspicuously absent from the cast of characters, which absence I felt most keenly.  HOWEVER, all that said, I still enjoyed this show immensely and felt that the scriptwriters and producers did Jim Butcher's creation proud.  Paul Blackthorne is a perfect Harry Dresden - scruffy yet charismatic, charming yet somehow seeming to be bumbling along all the time.  We don't see a lot of overt magic, nor lots of special effects, but what we do see is very neat and well done - the episode ""Things that go Bump"" is especially good, with all the neat glowing runes all over the wall, the green fire - the dragon!  Awesome stuff.

I noticed in one of the one-star reviews that there is a rumor this show is not going to be renewed for a second season.  I sure hope that is NOT the case, as I feel this show has a great deal of potential.  I have talked with other people around who are also fans of this show - it seems to have quite a following and I believe it would be sorely missed if it were cut off so quickly.  I would hate to see this become another ""Brimstone"" - another terrific show with a great premise cut off in its prime before it had a chance to grow.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of the first season of this excellent show - oh, and read the books, too.  They rock!",1188259200,5,2495,4.352051835853132

Bob's first appearance convinced me that sometimes change can be very good.  The hockey stick's making sense, too.  Okay, I still don't like Murphy.  I wish Valerie Cruz had been Susan Rodriguez and the cute, perky blonde who played Susan was Murphy.  So--I mostly ignore Murphy and concentrate on the things I love about this series.

No wonder it had a shaky start. No one knew what the deal was. But the show redeemed itself, at least in my eyes, by the time it was done. And done it seems to be, no season 2. Thanks SciFi channel. You gave us a glimmer of hope that we might get a second season and then blame others for you dragging your feet. Notice how the sales for this box set are climbing daily. Too bad you cancelled it.

  I really liked the way they fleshed out Bob, no pun intended. I hated the hockey stick, but hey...a little goofy can keep the humor rolling.

Essentially the television show is like detective Sam Spade mixed with Harry Potter.

And To Bryan from VA: a rousing ""I have to Disagree""
You can't blame the inconsistencies on the series. It was the network that made the bonehead decision to show them out of order. Did you actually read all of the books? Did you grasp the spirit of the books? The series as written provides a spirit well suited to be ""adapted"" to a tv series. But that's just what it is: an adaptation, that continues the base storyline. As far as the production values go, you can't expect that many special effects from a series that is based in a noir world. It would be a dishonor to the spirit of Books. Harry isn't about flashy special effects, he's about doing the right thing in a world were doing the wrong thing is so much easier. The TV writing is close to pure noir detective pulp, as are the books. Consequently, compare this to Firefly (which coincedentally got cancelled, too), not Eureka or BG (we are not going to even mention the differences in budget). This series was not meant to BE the actual stories in the books, more what might have happened in the in-between months. The only real resemblance was the episode filmed as the original pilot (Stormfront), and the werewolf one. Go to Jim's site. Maybe you'll understand a bit more.

I say WAY TO GO JIM!!! And to the Sci-Fi channel: whomever makes your decisions for programming has rocks for brains. Did you guys take your cues from FOX?",1186617600,12,1641,4.377049180327869
2845963,3,B000QUEQ4U,"While a worthy entry into the field of sci-fi/fantasy television shows -- and better than many of them -- the Dresden Files never really exceeds the level of being competent and sometimes charming. Good traits in an officemate, but aiming a little low for a television show.

On one hand, the creators seem to think the audience can't handle complicated backgrounds and dark story lines. This is ironic, considering the Dresden Files shared a network with the new Battlestar Galactica. So Dresden, despite the series' attempts at a fantasy-noir feel, lives in a world where bad things happen, but are always well-lit, everyone feels bad while dressed and groomed wonderfully and where the grubby streets look like generic Canadian outdoor location sets. The series lacks grit, in every sense of the word.

That said, it's a pleasant diversion and still more entertaining than, say, Blood Ties on Lifetime.

What's so great about this?  First off, the actors blend to create some kind of fantastic masterpiece for the eyes.  They look like some amazing artist painted them on camera.  I know that sounds strange, but the actors on this show are simply fun to watch...  So when I add that the acting and the dialogue are just as charming, I began to fall in love!
 I got the same feeling I had when I first discovered Underworld... !!!

""Wizard for Hire!""
Dresden Files tell the story of Harry the ""Wizard"", finding his place between both his world of magic and trying to deal with living in the city!  With a troubled past, and a good heart, Harry will sign on to trouble, leading both the police and magic to his doorstep.  It might be too much for just one man...
Harry is going to need friends!

Having the series at DVD quality instead of blurry SCIFI broadcast is going to be a treat as well.  Oh, and the fact that the pilot is expanded back to the full 2 episodes!

Doubt him in the beginning, but give him a chance; it's an investment I'm glad I made.  The only negative I really have to say, is that with only 12 episodes you're going to want more, EVEN though it WAS a satisfying ending..!

I write in support of this great TV series both because I will purchase the DVDs, and in hopes that the series will continue for many years to come. I've read all the Harry Dresden books and found, for once, the books and the TV series do justice to each other. The actors are perfect for the roles. No TV series can exactly follow a book but this keeps the heart and soul of the world Jim Butcher built for Harry. The stories are appeal to that magic younger demographic but also to us beyond that simplistic boundary. And I hope the producers remember we have money to spend too. Why encourage continuing the TV series here on Amazon? This is where I will buy more series DVDs! I sincerely hope this program will be renewed.",1185926400,7,759,4.390070921985815

2845992,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Based on the ultra-successful book series of the same name, this Television program brought its fans a fantastic mix of familiarity and newness to their beloved character of ""Harry Dresden"".

Ask yourself:
Do you like Firefly?
Do you like Angel?
Do you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

If you do, you WILL like the Dresden Files.  The show needed a bigger budget for its first season, but even with what they had the episodes are increasingly more entertaining and more entertaining with each one. And they are a heck of an addition to the MARVELOUS book series.

Here's to hoping there is a Second Season of the Dresden Files. Here's to hoping that you buy and love this series as much as so many others who gave it a chance already do.

2845993,5,B000QUEQ4U,"This terrific show premiered on SciFi Channel this winter, inspired by the popular book series about a wizard who helps the Chicago police solve crimes. Harry Dresden lives in a Boho-cool storefront loft in Chicago, typically under threat of romantic havoc and often broke, despite the detective work - when the going gets weird, they call in the pro. Much the reluctant hero, Harry is constantly drawn into all stripes of supernatural mayhem: sexy vampires, restless ghosts, criminals using black magic, and villains who won't stay dead. And like young Mr. Potter, Harry Dresden has his own family demons, plus an uneasy relationship with an underground hierarchy of spectral characters, who help or interfere, at will and with imperial caprice. Paul Blackthorne is wonderful; so is Terrence Mann as his ghostly sidekick Bob. Add an outstanding support cast of characters and some intriguing story arcs for some real fun.",1185667200,5,922,5.194630872483222
2845994,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Jim Butcher's answer to the question, ""What do I read after I've finished the Harry Pottr books?"" is read his Harry Dresden.  The only wizard to advertize in the yellow pages.

After The Dresden Files (TDF)crossed over to TV, book fans united behind the effort. Bright character driven scripts, scrumptious cinematography rank the series right up there with the best sci fi available out there.

Of course once you've watched the series, we Dresdenphilers have you hooked.  You won't rest until you've gotten the new hardcover releases or the old paperback versions consumed as well.  If you prefer, enjoy James Marsters reading the first four on audioMP3 or CD.",1185667200,7,662,5.036697247706422

The show's writers have done an excellent job of adapting Jim Butcher's stories and the differences between the two do not detract from either.  You can enjoy and be a fan of both - in fact, it multiplies the pleasure.  The casting is terrific, but especially in the choice of Paul Blackstone as Harry. And Terrance Mann as Bob is a true gem.  I love each of the scenes where this odd couple interacts!  Season 1 simply whets the appetite for Season 2!

This is one show that I didn't even flip channels during commercials for fear I would miss a single second. There's not another show on TV that I can say that about!

While the TV Dresden Files is based on the books - the stories, the plots, most definitely the acting and chemistry between the actors - of the TV series are of such outstanding quality and so well done that the TV Dresden Files is beyond excellent all on its own!! In fact, if the show wasn't as spectacular as it is, I never would have been interested enough to look for the books!

I found Jim Butcher's books series because of watching the TV series and I am so glad I did!! I've read all 9 books twice & look forward to the next in Spring! But right now, I can't wait until Season 2 of TV Dresden Files!!",1185580800,7,899,4.251461988304094
2845997,5,B000QUEQ4U,"Quite possibly the best supernatural/ fantasy series the SyFy Channel has ever put out since Farscape. This series has something for everyone from Wizards who moonlight as detectives to things that go bump in the night. Everyone should check it out just once. The series may start off slow, but you'll soon find yourself hooked quick.",1184889600,7,334,4.982142857142857
2846008,4,B000QUEQ4U,"This is a very well done series that takes the spirit of the books and improves on it in many aspects. This is mainly seen in the characterization, which is superb due to a core of great actors. As a fan of both the TV and the novels, I have to note that the show truly makes each of the characters feel more real and more complete. Harry is humanized, given greater depth then that of just the 'title' hero. Bob, who is quite marginalized in the novels, is brought to full life in the show. Even Detective Murphy shows us a little more then just being a cop.

My one caveat about the show is it's episodic nature. It only has one major arc (and only a few minor arcs that are more like continuous character struggles). This arc is that of Harry versus his uncle Justin (props to the writers of the show who changed Justin's last name to 'Morningway' over 'DuMorne', I felt this had a much cleaner feel to it) and this arc only really comes in heavily until episode 10.

However I feel that if the show garners another season they will have more then enough source material to correct this issue and go deeper with their stories. Another personal note, the first season was not aired in exact order by which they were made and seeded in terms of story. Whether or not this will change on the DVD is not known to me but it isn't a major issue (it actually just combines with the other issue I mentioned).

Overall, the televised version of The Dresden Files is more then worth the  money and the time invested to watch it. I recommend it to any fan of the novels as well as any fans of Fantasy. Enjoy it, I know I will yet again.",1184803200,9,1628,4.22508038585209

Paul Blackthorne brings Harry to life in all his workaday, Everywizard glory, and Terrence Mann is just flat out brilliant as Bob the cursed ghost. The plots are interesting, the dialog is snappy, and the characters are fun. I hope there are many seasons of Harry Dresden adventures to enjoy in the future.

If you liked Harry Potter, the X-Files, and/or Supernatural, you'd probably really get a kick out of The Dresden Files.",1184198400,10,604,4.921568627450981

The Chandleresque hero, wizard detective Harry Dresden (Paul Blackthorne), works as a consultant with a not-so-favored branch of the Chicago police on crimes with methods, perps or victims that don't fit into the non-magical view of reality. You'll find vivid, memorable characters, superb writing, wonderful dialogue, great acting, solid and complex plots. Watching the show may also leave you panting for more, and get you addicted to the book series by Jim Butcher, upon which this is based. (Yes, there are differences between the books and the TV show, but the differences do not detract from the quality in either case. Both series are magnificent.) An undiscovered gem of a show.

The dramody is a unique, endearing mix that could own some demographics SciFi has yet to reach. To Lionsgate/SciFi Channel I say, just give this thing its head with a second season and play it up!

However, after watching the series, I was inspired to read the books...all of them. The series is an excellent and entertaining adaptation of the books. Although the series differs from the book on plot points, character names and other little nuances, it carries the spirit of the books. The series writers have managed to pull off the impossible by bringing the personality and charm of Harry Dresden to the screen; and, they have managed to do so with whimsy. All in all, the stories are engaging and fun. After you watch the first episode you will want to see more.",1184112000,9,671,4.553719008264463

Even though there are differences, like there always is between books and film, the series is wonderful in it's own right.

2846016,5,B000QUEQ4U,"I had never heard of Harry Dresden prior to this series coming out, but was intrigued by the trailers and gave it a shot.  The first few episodes were just a little slow but interesting and certainly good enough to tempt me to watch more.  As the season went on, however, the writing and acting seemed to improve with every episode until the show ranked up there as a ""must see"" for me on a weekly basis.

When the season ended, I missed the show so much I picked up copies of all of the books by Jim Butcher and read them in order over the course of two weeks.  They were that enjoyable.

What's really surprising is that the show and the books are both excellent, yet really very different.  I have to say that the books are definitely better - they are very involved with each novel being a self contained ""case"" in the files of Harry Dresden and also advancing the central overarching plots of the series.  They are very addictive and enjoyable - well written pulp fiction with a science fiction/mystery/fantasy bent.

Still the show stands up very well on its own.  It's definitely more episodic with less emphasis on the growth of the characters and central plot themes, which is due to the limitations of the shows being 44 minute self contained stories.  The characters, from Bob to Murphy to Bianca to Dresden himself are all significantly different than the characters in the books.  And remarkably this works well for the show.

My suggestion would be to watch the series OR read the books, then take a short break and go back and enjoy whichever medium you didn't choose during the first go-around.  Just realize that they are not going to be exactly the same.",1182729600,13,1672,4.533333333333333
2846017,4,B000QUEQ4U,"First off, I do like the show, but not as the Dresden Files I know and love (i.e. the book series). Paul Blackthorne actually does a pretty good job, but doesn't quite come off as the overly-chivalrous, wiseass Harry of the books (and has yet to blow up as much stuff). I will say that Terrance Mann does a great Bob, one I like much better than the Bob of the books (who's a lot less British, a little less funny, and a little more horny), but the rest of the casting seems problematic to me. First of all, one of Murphy's leading characteristics was that she was short and blonde, and looked totally the opposite of a tough Chicago cop. Was it really necessary to change that (or make Susan Rodriguez a blonde for that matter?) or the multitude of storyline changes (like turning the evil adoptive father Justin DuMorne into Harry's uncle and changing his name to Morningway, this weird Bianca-as-nice-vamp-and-Harry's-ex thing, giving Murphy a kid, or the complete dismissal of the yet-unresolved and barely mentioned plotline centering around Murphy's dad?). Then there's the random prop changes (I don't think any fan of the books could honestly see Harry walking around with a hockey stick for a staff and a drumstick blasting rod, er `wand' for the uninitiated, and then there's the fact that we have yet to see Harry's infamous black leather duster) and I'm still not clear on why they made Mister orange. Is it really that difficult to track down a big grey tabby?

I'm still waiting to see what the writers will do with characters like Michael, Thomas, Molly and Mouse (Harry's temple rhino, er puppy), if they bother to include them at all, and it would be nice to get some Sidhe politics and some of the vampire war eventually.

Still, I can see where some of those changes were necessary. The TV series is definitely lacking in the gloom and doom of some of the books (especially the last few), but if it did remain completely faithful they probably wouldn't have gotten a following outside of fans of the novels.

All in all, not a bad show when considered separately from the books, and for those who haven't read them, wait until you've seen a few episodes of the show, you'll enjoy it much more.",1182643200,11,2212,4.623409669211196
8197582,5,B000QUEQ4U,"After having watched the first (and only) season of The Dresden Files, one has to wonder why the show died an ignoble death.  A combination of the supernatural, magic, and detective story, it was original and interesting.  It should have succeeded.

There are only 12 episodes, and during the first six, our hero, Harry Dresden, the only practicing wizard in the Chicago phone book, attempts to wrestle with supernatural intrusions into the gritty, crime-ridden Chicago landscape.  Armed with his hockey stick (a wizard's staff) and advised by ""Bob"" the ghost, there were only two problems with the show, both of which were corrected in the last six episodes.

The first problem was the fact that Dresden didn't trust the Chicago police.  Murphy, a police lieutenant among Chicago's finest, hires Harry whenever something odd occurs, but she seems oblivious to the fact that odd, magical things are happening.  She's aware Harry I lying to her, but the viewer is forced to wonder why he does so.  The writers decided that was unsustainable, and they started bringing Murphy into Harry's confidence.

The second problem was Harry's power level.  For the first episodes, he seems -- well -- not able to do very much.  Again that problem was corrected in the later episodes, and Harry becomes a force to be reckoned with.

Did the show fail because it's lead wasn't Hollywood handsome?  Did it fail because it was aired during a bad time slot?  Whatever the reason, it did not fail because of bad acting, a lack of character development, or predictable or uninteresting plots.  This show is worth buying and watching.

Where the show uses traits from the source material, such as narration from Dresden's point of view, it does it pretty good.

The show however, deviates by an almost impossible amount from the books. Very few elements are shared between the two series.
