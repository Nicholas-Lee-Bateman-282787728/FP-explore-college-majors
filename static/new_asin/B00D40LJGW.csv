8589317,4,B00D40LJGW,"Until the end of the first half of the film, I was pinned to my seat and eyes were glued to the screen. A very well made tale that combined elements of occult, witchcraft and horror was being told.
Emraan Hashmi, in another marvelous role plays an Indian magician who is still traumatized by visions of his past as a child and his encounter with a witch. Although the witch was killed by him, he somehow cannot seem to shake the feeling that dangers lurks for him and his family just around the corner. The mood and the set pieces are just wonderful and all help create a very eerie atmosphere through the film.
The director manages to create the eerie film consistently and there were moments that were truly very scary. I was spooked and I watch a lot of of horror films. But alas, the film falls apart in the second half and a very very weak ending . What could have been a classic horror film unfortunately turns out to be just dismal fare. three stars 11/10/2013",1384128000,,967,4.377777777777778
