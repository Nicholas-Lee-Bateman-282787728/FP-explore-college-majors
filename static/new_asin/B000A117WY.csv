8071833,5,B000A117WY,"This remarkable film dramatizes the story of the Hungarian merchant sailor and serial killer Aro Tolbukhin, and uses abundant documentary footage of the subject, shot in Guatemala during the time he spent in a Catholic mission in the country side, and when he was captured, interviewed in the jail of Pavn and finally executed by a firing squad. A work directed by a team of three filmmakers lead by Agust Villaronga (who won the Goya award for ""Black Bread"") the film combines footage in many formats (video, Super 8, 16 and 35mm), echoing the many levels that conform its cinematic discourse: besides the Tolbukhin case, it covers the moving story of Carme Curt, an ex nun who had a strong emotional relationship with Tolbukhin; and also the efforts of French cinastes Lise August and Yves Keetman to bring Tolbukhin's story to the screen in the 1980s: the impact of the material they shot of the real Aro Tolbukhin and the people who knew him in Guatemala (a priest, his lawyer, a peasant), incredibly grows as the dramatic sections tell the viewer the story behind the crimes. As the tale unfolds, the film reveals itself as a rich visual experience that never tries to hide its debt to imagination: it is illustrated by a black & white film-within-the-(color)film, called ""El traje deshabitado"" (The Uninhabited Dress), that concocts a fictional and lyrical past to Aro's life as a child and adolescent, based on true facts, given in an interview by his old Hungarian nanny, Slamr Yulan. It is more an evocation than a reconstruction, for it is not a psychological reasoning about the actions of the killer, but an illustration of coincidences in his dramatic, tragic life. As it turns out, ""Aro Tolbukhin  En la mente del asesino"" is like a Pandoras box in reserve, that deserves to be seen without prejudice.",1425081600,,1815,4.854838709677419
