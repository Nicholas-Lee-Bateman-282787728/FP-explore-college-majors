8253689,1,B0013XZ724,Poor video quality and the sound was inaudible a lot of the time.  I realize these are extremely old shows put onto disc but the overall quality was extremely poor.  I gave them as a gift and was rather embarassed when I was told about how bad they were. Would definitely NOT recommend this item.,1461801600,,296,4.363636363636363

8253693,3,B0013XZ724,"Four more rare TV game shows from the far reaches of 1950's obscurity.  Alpha is the one-stop company when it comes to Fifties television, and they've really outdone themselves with this fun release.  The four shows gathered on this DVD represent a time when a carefree optimism flowed from TV screens and into living rooms all over the world; one can't help but perhaps wish that we still had this kind of feelgood programming today.

TREASURE HUNT -
Jan Murray created and hosted this lively quiz game, which ran on NBC (and earlier on ABC).  Guests are given the choice to open several treasure chests which contain prizes and cash.  The hold-over contestant in this episode even brings along her pet monkey, who delights the crowd. This episode also contains rare promos for other NBC shows including Lou Costello in ""Truth or Consequences"", Lee Marvin in ""M-Squad"", and Phyllis Kirk and Peter Lawford in ""The Thin Man"".

DOLLAR A SECOND -
Once again Jan Murray is the emcee for this combination quiz and skill show, which seems very reminiscent of ""Beat the Clock"".  Contestants must fulfill various quizzes and skill games within a pre-determined amount of time (which remains a mystery - heightening the tension), whilst they also earn $1 for each second they spend onstage.  Sponsored by something called Mogen David Wine, this is I think the most lively game show I've ever seen!

JUVENILE JURY -
It what might have been the blueprint for ""Art Linkletter's House Party"", Jack Barry acts as emcee to a panel of adorable little kids who attempt to answer problems written in by home viewers.  This is the ""infamous"" episode where one of the children claims to have been given the questions the night before, and Barry must quell the reaction from the audience.  Jack Barry was no stranger to live TV's controversies.  Sponsored by Underwood Typewriters and Geritol.

IT COULD BE YOU! -
Hosted by Bill Leyden, this wasn't so much a game show as it was a ""This is Your Life""-style surprise for ordinary people who needed a little help or recognition for their hard work or a past accomplishment.  Sponsored by Prell Liquid Shampoo, this particular episode congratulates an army sergeant and his wife who recently welcomed two sets of twins.  Later on we meet a couple who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary but have never had enough money to spend on themselves; plus a former World War II pilot who helped save his crew after they were shot down over the Philippines.

Quality is typical Alpha (those who regularly buy from this label know what to expect - basic but watchable prints).  These rare shows look like they all came from kinescope elements but are in very decent shape all things considered.  If you enjoy Fifties TV shows you'll get a kick out of these.",1290038400,7,2784,4.80083857442348
8253694,5,B0013XZ724,Journey back to the 50's during the quiz show heyday.  The episodes featured in this volume are sure to bring back pleasant memories.,1279584000,,133,4.782608695652174
8253695,4,B0013XZ724,"This DVD features one complete episode of 4 different 50's TV series. Altough it's called ""Lost 50's Quiz Shows"", ""Juvenile Jury"" and ""It Could Be YOU"" are not really quiz shows, altough the latter is quite fun.
The episode of ""Dollar a Second"" is complete with orginal commercials for wine.
Please note that although the picture quality isn't perfect, That's due to the limitations of early LIVE TV, and not because of bad remastering.

I enjoyed this DVD, and I think it's a great way to see what else was on TV apart from ""I Love Lucy"".",1207785600,9,539,4.556701030927835
