8000173,5,B0000D9BBG,I must for fan of NFB animation and shorts as well fans of Norman McLaren. It's also great insight to Mr. Munro as an artist and person and animation scene from the NFB and england. Defiantly for lover of independent animation and film making.,1454889600,,243,4.545454545454546
8000174,5,B0000D9BBG,"Get it not only for the Oscar winning 'Neighbours' but also for the other delightful and witty animated films. And don't miss the directors commentary - sometimes it's a little short (Grant doesn't speak unless he has something to say) but the tale of the dancer and the bottle of gin is priceless!

Enjoy.",1168387200,2,306,4.666666666666667
8000175,3,B0000D9BBG,"Anyone with a cursory interest should first look to the two disc Norman McLaren set available from the same DVD company as part of the ""Milestone Collection."" In it you will find ""Neighbors,"" which appears here, as well as a variety of other much better films. Munro was sort of McLaren's friend and collaborator, and this DVD set is perhaps best looked at as a nice... supplement to the McLaren DVD's, as most of the material of note on here was actually directed by McLaren with Munro acting as an assistant/star. The big contribution Munro made, however, that makes the DVD worth seeing, is the short film ""Toys,"" in which children watch a toy store window display, but soon the army men come to life and the G.I. Joes act out a very grisly realistic battle with explosions and great stop motion by Munro- making a very nice point about the sort of toys boys play with while elsewhere men are being killed senselessly, etc. It's suprising the drama that Munro got out of those action figures. Anyway, certainly not worth the money unless you're building an extensive Film Board of Canada DVD collection.",1166745600,,1106,4.706185567010309
8000176,5,B0000D9BBG,"The cover of this DVD is bang on - ""to encounter the work of Grant Munro is to discover an artist of inimitable talent and charm.""  Watching the Oscar winner ""Neighbors"" is worth the cost of this DVD alone.  Combined with the fantastic audio commentary, this is a rare gem indeed.
Combined with the other amazing features, including the gem ""Boo Hoo"" I was spellbound by the work of this amazing artist.
You won't be disappointed.",1081296000,3,430,4.644736842105263
