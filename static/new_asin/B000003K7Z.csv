Written by: Rene Echevarria
Directed by: Cliff Bole
""Facets"" is an episode that has a perfect timing in the near-end of the third season of the show and a better execution than it might have had, if the worse had come to being.
After three long years of waiting, we finally get to see the spectrum of personalities that make up the character of Jazia Dax, one of the most potential characters of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
""Facets"" describes to us the events that take place when Jazia has her zhian'tara, a Trill ritual where a new host can meet all the previous hosts of his/her symbiont as their personalities are momentarily removed one at a time to a host body.
All the other main characters and a few additional ones are chosen to fill that purpose, including Quark, who gets Audrid, a female host...
The episode deals with Jazias self doubts, as she begins to harvest doubts about herself as a matching host for the other six. The story gets complicated further as Odo and Curzon, the host preceeding Jazia, form a hybrid entity, who wants to stay the way he is. Finally, deeper reasons for this wish are revealed, leading to in depht character exploration of Jazia and even Curzon.
The episode isn't plot driven and it gives good room for character moments and deeper drama, that even the subplot about Nog's entrance exam for Starfleet Academy can't interfere with.
In the end, however, the episode is too shallow and vague, and it contradicts the second season Dax-episode, Playing God, to wich it's otherwise a sequel in character terms.
The pacing of the story is quite adequate, though, and Terry Farrel's and Ren Auberjoins's exellent performances quarantee a quite satisfying forty minutes of drama that provokes thoughts and entertains as well.",1014940800,,1783,4.811074918566775
7902576,4,B000003K7Z,"""Facets"" offers us the spectacle of a fascinating Trill rite known as zhian'tara, in which the memories of each of Dax's previous hosts are transferred into Jadzia's friends.  This allows Jadzia to interact with them.  Sounds like a great idea, but it turns out to be a most unpleasant experience, especially when Curzon announces he likes being joined with Odo.  This is a great idea, but this is not a great episode.  The genesis for it seems to be the fact that way back when Curzon had rejected Jadzia as a Trill host.  Obviously things changed and while ""Facets"" offers an answer to this mystery, it is a minor mystery to be solved after all, especially wasting as good of an idea as the zhian'tara.  Besides, I agree with those who say less Curzon more Joran, Lela and the other hosts.",997488000,,791,4.574468085106383
7902577,5,B000003K7Z,"Another welcome episode that concentrates on the Dax worm that lives inside Jadzia. Each of the major characters allows one of the past hosts to  take over their bodies, temporarily, Quark is given a female personality  who sits and brushes Jadzia's hair in a hilarious scene. Sisko gets the mad  former host who killed some people, wonderfully over-acted by Avery Brooks.  All in all a cracking episode that sheds a new light on the Dax character  in pure Star Trek style!",966729600,4,473,4.790123456790123
7902578,4,B000003K7Z,"The Trill are a very interesting species.  They are two seperate species who live as one.  You have the worm-thing that, because of an environmental disaster hundreds of years ago on the Trill homeworld, needs to form a  symbiotic relationship with a humanoid (the other half of the Trill).  Now,  not all humanoid Trill qualify to host the worm-things in their chest  (belly?) but those that do, bond with the worms for life.  Only problem is  that the worm-things live a heck of a lot longer than the humanoids do.  Jadzia the humanioid is the current host of Dax the worm but there have  been several previous humanoid hosts and, through Trill ritual, we get to  meet 'em all in ""Facets"".  It's about time!  The hints of what  Dax's former hosts were like have been dropping since the beginning of  DS9's run but here we finally see who they were.
This is a solid episode  and it was satisfying to finally find out about all of Dax's previous  hosts.  Jadzia and Curzon we know about, as well as the homicidal Joran but  it was finding out about the others that made this episode fun for me.  A  politician, a musician, a gymnast, a pilot -- Dax has had many incarnations  and many stories.  Good episode!",962755200,6,1208,4.5162790697674415
7902579,3,B000003K7Z,"I just got finished reading a review of mine which 15 people found unhelpful, so I'm going to try to be more constructive in my comments.
  Here goes: Too much time was devoted to Curzon.  All the other hosts (the  one exception being Joran) had about a minute to make there existense and  personality known.  Curzon got half the hour, and Curzon was the only past  host Jadzia talked about in most of the episodes, so we already knew much  more about him then any other host.  Otherwise, this was a pretty good  episode.
  Now watch, I'll probably get 15 more ""unhelpful""  tally votes.  (That is if 15 people even see this, I know the page for this  video doesn't get much traffic)",957571200,17,682,4.430894308943089
