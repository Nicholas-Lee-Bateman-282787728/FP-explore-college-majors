7992745,5,B00009QGF5,"This tape is great, well worth the costs.  I've watched it a number of times and it caused me to make a trip  to Northern Vermont to visit Ben's Mill in it's present state.  Ben was killed a number of years ago on the road in front of his mill one evening.  The mill is in a historic trust that could use some help to keep going.  ANYONE interested in preserving history look up Ben's Mill on the internet and look what is going on. One man has dedicated his remaining life to holding it together for the rest of us but he is 75 and in declining health.",1317945600,,553,4.036697247706422
7992746,5,B00009QGF5,"I first learned of Ben's Mill reading ""The Workshop Book"". Some years past after I read the chapter on Ben Thresher and his mill I then bought the VCR. (before DVD) After I watched it a few dozon times I began writing the people that started the foundation that is restoring the mill and learned a bit more about Ben Thresher. After the video was made back in 1981 he was tragically hit by a car on the highway that was out front of the mill. To anyone that is interested in Early American Industry and that small time period ""Where craft and machine technology lived side by side"", this movie is simply wonderful. Ben Thresher was one of a kind. A simply facinationg man.",1250467200,3,672,4.384
