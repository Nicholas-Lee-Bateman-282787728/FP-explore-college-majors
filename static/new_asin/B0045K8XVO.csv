Remember THEY are not exact in storyline, but the you will get to know the characters and either love'm or hate'm (JUST like the U.S.cast)",1493337600,,536,4.6421052631578945
8416757,5,B0045K8XVO,The first season of Shameless-US Version got me interested in the show from the UK.  I picked up a non-regional DVD player for about $50 and my wife and I have just finished season 5.  We can't stop watching.  A great feature for Americans is that the menu offers subtitles to help with the Northern English accents.,1313798400,6,316,4.508771929824562
