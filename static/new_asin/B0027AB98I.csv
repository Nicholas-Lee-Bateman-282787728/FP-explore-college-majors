8354377,5,B0027AB98I,"What I found most valuable is that this film, unlike many others, shows how the Poles suffered under Nazism and also demonstrates how many Poles risked their lives to save Jews.  So much of the Holocaust focuses on Auschwitz.  This helps us understand the fuller scope of the Nazi killing machine.  It is done in a similar style as Lanzmann's Shoah.  But this effort really humanizes the Poles.  Please add this to your Holocaust library.",1337040000,10,438,4.786666666666667
8354378,5,B0027AB98I,"""Belzec"" is a haunting portrait of the Polish extermination camp where over 600,000 Jews were murdered. Although the idea was to get people to forget about Belzec and erase it from their memories', this film shows how through stories and art, the people who suffered would not let it be forgotten.

After watching, Lanzman's ""Shoah"", ""Belzec"" was a great continuation of the story of remembering the Holocaust and the people who were affected by it.

To anyone who is interested in documentaries about the Holocaust, I would also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rape-of-Europa/dp/B0011ZJ5C2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rape of Europa</a>. It's about how the Nazi's stole Jewish art and the efforts to get the art back to the rightful owners.",1272326400,5,801,5.956521739130435
8354379,5,B0027AB98I,"""Belzec"" digs into one of the most deeply troubling of the Holocaust's early chapters: the Belzec extermination camp, where Nazis murdered hundreds of thousands, and then erased nearly all traces of the camp and their crimes. Unlike the more ""infamous"" death camps of this era, where tourists continue to see remnants of the Final Solution's industrial scale--Belzec now is a grove of trees near an otherwise unremarkable little village in southeast Poland.

In 1985, filmmaker Guillaume Moscovitz was moved by Claude Lanzmann's masterwork on the Holocaust, ""Shoah""--a 10-hour documentary that focuses mainly on real people who lived near the Nazi concentration camps. Belzec is included briefly in Lanzmann's epic film, but Moscovitz decided around 2002 that Belzec's mysteries deserved a separate, feature-length documentary.

I agree after having watched ""Belzec""--including some portions of the film that I viewed twice and even three times to catch small details.

""Belzec"" opens with Heinrich Himmler's chilling claim that the Holocaust would represent ""a glorious page of our history that has never been written--and shall never be written."" The attempt to erase all traces of the crimes at Belzec were in keeping with Himmler's goal. The grand scale of the genocide would be followed by erasure and, finally, a complete revision of world history.

First and foremost, Lanzmann's and Moscovitz's films are testaments to the enduring power of memory. Yes, they raise horrific questions about how much neighbors of this camp knew during the Final Solution! In fact, we learn through Moscovitz's interviews, these neighbors knew precisely what was happening!

Most importantly, though, the film invites us, as viewers, to actively help in the reconstruction of memory.

""Belzec"" opens with an old man in the town denying that he suspected anything--and claiming he fled from the horrors that later unfolded. But, soon, we meet more elderly townspeople who admit that they did, indeed, know exactly what was happening. They couldn't have avoided the crimes, it turns out--as one interview after another demonstrates that the villagers' homes are all just a stone's throw from the site of the death camp.

Eventually, Moscovitz shares with us accounts of several of Belzec's survivors. The most moving story comes from a woman who was hidden as a little girl, first, in a cemetery and, later, in a cramped hole in the ground.

As these vivid memories pile up, one atop another, as a testament to the crime committed here, Moscovitz finally reveals that one local resident actually painted images of what happened in the camp to help preserve the truth. Seeing these paintings sears the collected verbal memories in our own minds.

As troubling as this subject matter may be, ""Belzec"" is an eloquent appeal to our universal responsibility to preserve the truth--to never allow the erasure of our neighbors' lives.",1266883200,22,2914,5.29004329004329
