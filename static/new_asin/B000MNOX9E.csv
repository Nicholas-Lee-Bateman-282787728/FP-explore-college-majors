Enter you Yanke Irving with alone with his companiom a talking baseball screw must make a heroic Journey to save the world series and reunite babe with his precious bat Darla. Feature a cast that inlcudes William H. Macy and ancient but still funny black comedain actress Woppie goldberg who about four years prior to this stared in the log budger 2003 production of Racing Stripes. This movie should be for all baseball fans or anyone that every accomplished something that seemed inpossible. If you like this I also recommend Rockie of the year, the rockie, and the Sandlot I and II. Can you Yanke Irving finalk prove that he fits in that ever person is capable of doin great things if they believe.",1178323200,,794,4.638297872340425
2738007,5,B000MNOX9E,"This was a wonderful movie. Don't regret buying this one at all. You don't have to love baseball to love this movie. Not just a kids movie, there is something for everyone. Christopher Reeve's ideals came shinning through. Great job!",1175990400,3,233,4.85
2738008,4,B000MNOX9E,"This animated feature is far different than the ones I'm use to seeing. However, it surpasses the realism of many of the others with a powerful message of perservance and making your dreams happen. This movie made me laugh, then I cried; then I laughed again just to cry even more later. It's produced and directed by a man who valued himself the meaning of trying and trying again. In a collaboration with his wife Dana and other respected innovators, this was the last movie Christopher Reeve worked on before his death. There is a tribute to him as a bonus feature on this disc.

Like the ever popular first Ice Age movies and both Garfield films, the movie buyer has the option to both full and widescreen modes. However, I'm not happy with the double-sided release the studio decided to do. It's quiet annoying and even anxiety-ridden as you try extra hard when flipping the disc not to drop or scratch it. One side's bad enough, but double-sided is just not pleasing.",1174780800,12,973,4.624277456647399
2738009,4,B000MNOX9E,I took my grandson to this movie and he loved it.  I loved the lovely message that came with it.  Not often do you find a movie that has a good message for children in addition to the movie being charming also.,1164499200,5,210,3.9761904761904763
2738010,1,B000MNOX9E,"This is a light-headed film [as opposed to light-hearted] that might appeal to kids, mainly because they haven't seen enough films yet to spot the the five pounds of cliche's stuffed into a two-pound bag. As is the case in almost every kid-oriented film, the basic dynamic is between parent and child: Dad, custodian at the Yankee stadium, loses his job because he lets his son into the equipment locker to see the Babe's bat, and it's stolen. So now the son has to recover it. [I've got to 'be there' for my Dad. Does this sound familiar? In 'Bambi II', it was 'I have to win Dad's respect. In 'Finding Nemo' it's 'I failed my son and I must make it up. I could go on at length. Don't scriptwriters have any new plot devices?]

He discovers a wise-cracking baseball [Rob Reiner] who becomes the mentor and the two of them embark on an impossible quest to recover the bat. Happily for Yankee, the scriptwriters weren't too bright, so the quest doesn't become too hard. Add some improbable turns of luck [Cliche #31, 37, and 64] and all turns out as well as you figured it would. The story plods to its foreordained conclusion. The music is tolerable [not as sappy as Disney] but there's not a laugh in the full 90-minutes. And the bat turns out to be another magical talking character. OK, I'll suspend disbelief for one talking object, but not two. They say that Whoopie Goldberg voiced the bat, but she sounded like a 'southern belle'.

And then, when the bat gets back in the Babe's hands at the last possible moment [bottom of the ninth, two outs...you know the drill] the nasty umpire says ""You got two minutes to put a batter in, or you Yankees forfiet the game"", who do they put in? Gee, I wouldn't want to give away the ending but I was looking around to see if my seat had an airline barf-bag.

Was there anything good? Yes. It's a beautifully designed film. Everything looked good. Movement flowed, the animation was smooth. The characters looked good. Like ""Open Season"", the 'look' of things was nicely stylized. It just left me wishing that the story had more substance. I suspect that this film saw light-of-day mainly because the people making it wanted to do something nice for Christopher Reeve. {If I recall rightly, Reeve [the Director] died during the 'filming')",1162771200,7,2282,4.588235294117647
2738011,5,B000MNOX9E,"""Everyone's Hero"" is a wonderful tale about a young boy whose father is fired from his job at Yankee Stadium when Babe Ruth's bat is stolen on his watch.  The boy knows who stole the bat and sets out to reclaim it for the Babe and to save his father's much needed job.  The young boy, Yankee Irving, is a huge dreamer, who hopes to one day play for the Yankees.  He picks up quite a friend in Screwie (Rob Reiner), a Major League foul ball who hesitantly agrees to help Yankee recover the bat as long as the boy promises to leave him to rot in the sandlot where Yankee found him.

Yankee meets quite a motley crew on his travels from New York to Chicago.  He runs into some kind-hearted hobos, a young girl named Marti (Raven), who gets him in touch with her father, Rooster Brewster of the Negro League, who's team just happens to be headed to Chicago.  He also runs into the villainous Lefty Maginnis (William H. Macy), a washed out pitcher who thinks that by stealing Babe's bat, Darlin', he can save his job with the Chicago Cubs and win the World Series.

The story moves at a wonderful pace and holds the attention of both children and adults.  My daughter went crazy when Screwie and Darlin' went at each other, and the antics of Lefty had everyone laughing.  It features an all-star cast including those aforementioned and Robert Wagner, Whoopi Goldberg, Mandy Patinkin, and Brian Dennehy as Babe Ruth.  Joe Torre plays the manager of the Yanks and Dana Reeve plays Yankee's mom.  Of course, Reeve and her husband, Christopher Reeve (who initially directed this film), both passed away before seeing this film come to life on the screen.  They should both be proud of their work done on this film.

If you love baseball, strong family bonds, slapstick comedy, or nostalgia, I highly recommend you see this film.  Rest assured that you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this film, but for those of us who do, it's nice to see not only the Babe get some screen time, but Lou Gehrig as well.

A highly recommend, future classic, family film.",1158451200,33,2051,4.475806451612903
2738012,2,B000MNOX9E,"You know you've made a bad kid movie when the kids in the theater don't laugh. Especially when there are about a hundred snot jokes. 'Everyone's Hero' is a terrible kids film. It's not worse than 'Barnyard', and I won't even compare it to 'Cars', because nothing could beat that movie. Let's just say that this is worse than 'RV'. Maybe it's because I only see a handful of kids movies a year that I didn't enjoy this one. Maybe it's because the false messages that kids movies peddle make me angry. I don't have a good reason why they do, but they do. I think it's because the whole idea that movies for kids can't just be for entertainment. They have to have a message.

Adult movies don't have messages, and if they do they are subtle, and usually only in Oscar nominated movies. For example: 'Crash': ""Don't let your prejudices get the best of you."" 'Munich': ""Violence begets violence."" So on and so forth. But, you didn't see a message in 'Miami Vice', or 'Crank', or 'The Devil Wears Prada'. 'Cars' had a subtle message. 'Over The Hedge' did as well, and the only things that made that a kids movie was the animation and the PG rating. However, lots of kids didn't understand that movie, because it was largely satirical, poking fun at our reliance on junk food and shiny TV's. This movie pokes fun at...Eleanor Rosevelt. That's not an easy target at all.

The message in 'Everyone's Hero' is pervasive throughout the movie, but it's understated for most of the time. But, the last line in the movie pounds the message of the movie so hard into your head that you reject it. It doesn't imply the message, like most kids movies (as if that's not bad enough), but it out-rightly says it. This is how the line of dialogue goes: ""Even if you're not good at something, never give up. Keep trying, and you're sure to succeed."" The movie is about a young boy, Yankee Irving, who lives in Depression-era New York. His father works at Yankee Stadium as a janitor, playing to the kids movie cliche that the impoverished kid rises to the top. It would be nice to see a rich kid rise off his lazy butt and succeed at something. Anyway, Babe Ruth's bat gets stolen, and Yankee has to go off to look for it.

The only reason the movie gets two stars as opposed to one is because Yankee's talking baseball (voiced by Rob Reiner) provides a few mild chuckles, and the mere fact that Babe Ruth's bat is a sassy black woman is so ridiculous that it's a little funny. Other than that, parents will find that the movie is a nice nap, and kids may enjoy it. In my screening, there were three groups of parents and kids, and only one group (a mother and her two small children) were laughing, and not that hard or often. This is one of the may movies that will dissapoint at the box office, but will make a killing on DVD when parents buy it for their kids to watch while they enjoy a bath.

There is a scene in the movie 'The Ring' that I am reminded of every time I see a bad kids movie. The mother character rents Pokemon videos for her son, and as he sits in front of the TV, transfixed by flashing colors and incoherent dialogue, she sits in the bathtub reading a magazine. That is probably the only way this movie will make money, sadly: a woman in a tub.",1158451200,4,3246,4.351485148514851
2738013,4,B000MNOX9E,"EVERYONE'S HERO is a charming, heartwarming, and delightful animated film about a young boy who loves baseball and leaves home to help his hero, Babe Ruth, and save his dad's job.  The film includes an impressive cast of talented voice actors: Brian Dennehy, Whoopi Goldberg, Jake Austin, William H. Macy, Richard Kind, Mandy Patinkin, Rob Reiner, Raven-Symone, Robert Wagner, and even Joe Torre as the Yankee's Manager.

The year is 1932.  ""Yankee"" Irving (Jake Austin) is a ten-year-old boy who lives in New York and loves baseball, but no matter how hard he tries he always ends up striking out and falling down.  Yankee becomes frustrated and almost gives up until he finds a talking baseball (Rob Reiner).  He names the ball Screwie and Screwie becomes Yankee's companion and, on a different level, a part of his conscious.  Yankee's dad works at Yankee Stadium.  The Yankee's are beating the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cubs' owner (Robert Wagner) hatches a plan to have his dirtiest player, Lefty Maginnis (William H. Macy), steal Babe Ruth's bat, Darlin' (Whoopi Goldberg).  Lefty runs into Yankee before he steals Darlin'.  When Yankee's father is fired because of the missing bat, Yankee realizes what has happened and sets out to get Darlin' back and return her to the Babe.  The journey takes Yankee from NewYork to Chicago. Along the way he meets some friendly hobos (actually most hobos in that period were friendly) and has an encounter with some baseball players in the Negro Leagues.

The movie vividly recreates the images of the early 1930s and the colorful palette is quite pleasing.  At the film's heart is a message of determination and perseverance, even when the odds are stacked against a person.  Tied to that message is an affection and love for baseball as well as a nod to the injustice of poverty and racism.

There are some inaccuracies with the historical basis of the film.  For instance, the Yankees did play the Cubs in the 1932 World Series, but the series only lasted four games, not seven.  Yet, where the film veers from history for dramatic effect, it makes up for it in other areas, such as the details in the uniforms of the Cincinnati Tigers' Negro League team.  Some might be confused by the lack of specific style in EVERYONE'S HERO:  at times the film looks like a sophisticated piece of animation that is almost Pixar-worthy, while there are other times the film veers into antics similar to the hijinxes of the Road Runner, Wylie Coyote, Bugs Bunny, and other Warner Brother characters.  Personally, I enjoyed this uneven-style because it grounded the film in reality, while reminding viewers it's just a cartoon.

I thoroughly enjoyed EVERYONE'S HERO.  It's a great animated baseball picture with important and strong messages about determination and the importance of family.  The film brings recognition to forgotten elements of American history, e.g. the Negro Leagues and hobos.  It's a film full of promise and hope.  It is also the last project Christopher Reeve worked on before his death and for film buffs the movie is worth watching for that fact alone.  But like many of the films Reeve made, EVERYONE'S HERO appeals to a much broader audience, not just children and baseball fans. It's a movie that calls out to the hero in everyone.",1158364800,21,3307,4.883512544802867

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

Partially directed by the tragic Christopher Reeve, the computer-animated Everyone's Hero was released in 2006 and featured parts voiced by such luminaries as Rob Reiner, William H. Macy, Brian Dennehy, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Wagner, Joe Torre, Mandy Patinkin, Forrest Whitaker and Reeve's wife, Dana.

While primarily aimed at children, there are enough references in it to keep adult baseball aficionados happy. The story focuses on Yankee, a kid who lives with his parents in a tenement in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium in 1932 (the clever animation replete with the reproduction of old newsreels provides a panorama of the depression era, palatable to a pre-pubescent audience).

After Yankee discovers a talking baseball (Rob Reiner) who eventually becomes his pal, he visits his father who's employed at Yankee Stadium as a maintenance worker. At the behest of the rapacious owner of the Chicago Cubs, a Cub pitcher breaks into the locker room and steals Babe Ruth's (talking) bat Darlin' (Whoopi Goldberg). Yankee witnesses the theft but his father doesn't believe him and back at home sends him to his room. Soon afterward, Yankee's father loses his job as he's held responsible for the theft.

The rest of Everyone's Hero focuses on Yankee's sojourn to Chicago in his attempt to recover the purloined bat and return it to the Babe. Along the way, he meets baseball players from the Negro Leagues who give him a ride to Chicago where the Yankees face the Cubs in the 1932 World Series.

While well-intentioned, the films' scenarists strike more than one wrong note in trying to please both children and adults. The biggest sin is casting the Cubs (represented by their maniacal but goofy owner) as the bad guys and the Yankees as a group of sportsmen who can do no wrong. By taking sides, Chicago's baseball team is unfairly maligned, which sets a bad example for kids, not only because it's untrue but it also promotes an aura of unhealthy competition for kids to emulate.

Another sin involves the introduction of the Negro Leagues into the narrative. On the surface, it appears the films' scenarists should be commended for making the Negro Leagues' players part of the story. Their disgraceful exclusion from the national pastime prior to World War II is a sad chapter in American history that all Americans should study and at the minimum, be made aware of.

Unfortunately the whole idea that Negro League players were excluded from baseball is not made clear in the film and the depiction of the players being ""happy-go-lucky"" does a disservice to the historical reality. Perhaps it was felt that children would not be able to digest the ugly history but in some way the screenwriters should have found a way to communicate the reality of racial discrimination without offending juvenile sensibilities.

Finally, the narrative takes a turn at the denouement that perhaps only younger children will enjoy but will effectively turn off more sophisticated kids and accompanying adults. I'm referring to the absurd turn of events where Yankee is allowed to bat in a World Series game and hits an ""inside-the-park"" home run, winning the game for the Yankees. While talking bats and baseballs may be interpreted as a figment of a kid's imagination, no such interpretation can be made on the silly conceit of a boy being allowed to bat in a major league baseball game.

While very young kids might enjoy Everyone's Hero, anyone older should be turned off by the overwhelmingly goofy tenor of the characters' machinations. Mix that in with the rather ugly turn of favoring one team over another and surprisingly you have a children's' film that is pretty much unfit for children.",1459814400,,3752,4.979233226837061

I wanted my children to get a basic idea about the time of the depression, and baseball history, but most of all learn the qualities of perserverance and positive character traits.  This movie is awesome!  A tean year old boy must make a journey in more than one sense..  to do the right thing.  He learns a lot along his journey.

2738155,3,B000MNOX9E,"Everyones Hero is one of those rare animated features that boasted a pretty hardy theatrical run but slipped onto the DVD scene fairly quietly and slipped into relative obscurity since.  Its kind of a shame really, because the piece has a lot of heart and its delivered in such a manner that children and adults alike can find something to take away from the experience.  This isn't to say that the film is without flaw of course but before we get into the ups and downs of Everyones Hero, lets take a moment to review the facts.

Released on the big screen back in 2006, Everyones Hero is the 88-minute romp of a blend of historical and fictional characters based on a semi-true story that just so happens to be 20th Century Foxs first theatrical release to wear the G-rating since 97s Anastasia.

Set in 1932, back when the concept of CG held absolutely no meaning and the Great Depression was just getting underway, we follow the exploits of young baseball fan Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin), whose father Stanley (Mandy Patinkin) happens to work as a janitor for New York City's Yankee Stadium.  Like most Playstation-less kids of the era, Yankee has dreams of playing for the Yankees despite lacking the skills to play sandlot baseball with the meanies on his block.

One day during one such bullying, he finds a talking baseball on the sandlot he names Screwie (Rob Reiner).  Sure this could have been enough material to base the entire film upon (after all, how many of us discover a talking baseball only to store it in our underwear drawer) but alas, this proves only the beginning of the adventures for dear Yankee.

While father and son are in the stadium, a thief steals Babe Ruth's famous bat Darlin' (which can also talk like Screwie and is voiced by Whoopi Goldberg).  While the reason certain sporting goods can talk is never revealed, the heist results in Yankee's father being blamed and fired.  The real hijinks concern Yankee reuniting talking bat with talking ball, reuniting lucky bat with proper owner and, as a bonus, perhaps clearing his fathers good name in the process.

On the surface theres a lot of potential for a good feeling classic and the cast of voice talent and even direction is top notch.  Kids will likely enjoy the tale and forgive its shortcomings though adults will likely find it a bit tedious by the midway point.  It has moments of believability but by the end talking bats and balls are the least of the farfetchedness.  Prepare for a near constant succession of coincidences and happenstances that result in a lot of clich situations that all culminate in a very unlikely finale.  Of course some degree of suspension of disbelief is required on account of the fact that the tale intertwines its prose with actual historical dates/ events, going in expecting an entirely fictional affair is perhaps the best bet for the skeptical adult viewer.

Pacing and production values are solid; in fact keep in mind that in 2006 even industry leader Pixar shied away from the practice of animating humans due to the difficulty of keeping things proportional yet the folks behind Everyones Hero showed no fears in doing so and the end result still holds up today.

In conclusion this ones absolutely chalk full of good intentions and hints of greatness but the end result is fairly mediocre.  A little more grounding in reality coupled to greater effort to avoid the far-reaching, forcefully feel-good moments could have made Everyone's Hero fun and inspirational for, well, everyone, not just for the little ones.",1388793600,,3550,4.7918032786885245

Simple, innocent story with funny bad guys, rather than scary, who get what's coming to them for cheating and being mean. Lots of silly slapstick. The characters aren't super-complicated and the humor is definitely geared young--you won't get the big private, grown-up laughs that some kid movies embed for us adults. But my two-year-old LOVES this film and loves playing baseball as a result. And I'm happy with the absence of unwanted influences: no real violence, no guns, no nightmares.

2738219,4,B000MNOX9E,"EVERYONE'S HERO is a charming, heartwarming, and delightful animated film about a young boy who loves baseball and leaves home to help his hero, Babe Ruth, and save his dad's job. The film includes an impressive cast of talented voice actors: Brian Dennehy, Whoopi Goldberg, Jake Austin, William H. Macy, Richard Kind, Mandy Patinkin, Rob Reiner, Raven-Symone, Robert Wagner, and even Joe Torre as the Yankee's Manager.

The year is 1932. ""Yankee"" Irving (Jake Austin) is a ten-year-old boy who lives in New York and loves baseball, but no matter how hard he tries he always ends up striking out and falling down. Yankee becomes frustrated and almost gives up until he finds a talking baseball (Rob Reiner). He names the ball Screwie and Screwie becomes Yankee's companion and, on a different level, a part of his conscious. Yankee's dad works at Yankee Stadium. The Yankee's are beating the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cubs' owner (Robert Wagner) hatches a plan to have his dirtiest player, Lefty Maginnis (William H. Macy), steal Babe Ruth's bat, Darlin' (Whoopi Goldberg). Lefty runs into Yankee before he steals Darlin'. When Yankee's father is fired because of the missing bat, Yankee realizes what has happened and sets out to get Darlin' back and return her to the Babe. The journey takes Yankee from NewYork to Chicago. Along the way he meets some friendly hobos (actually most hobos in that period were friendly) and has an encounter with some baseball players in the Negro Leagues.

The movie vividly recreates the images of the early 1930s and the colorful palette is quite pleasing. At the film's heart is a message of determination and perseverance, even when the odds are stacked against a person. Tied to that message is an affection and love for baseball as well as a nod to the injustice of poverty and racism.

There are some inaccuracies with the historical basis of the film. For instance, the Yankees did play the Cubs in the 1932 World Series, but the series only lasted four games, not seven. Yet, where the film veers from history for dramatic effect, it makes up for it in other areas, such as the details in the uniforms of the Cincinnati Tigers' Negro League team. Some might be confused by the lack of specific style in EVERYONE'S HERO: at times the film looks like a sophisticated piece of animation that is almost Pixar-worthy, while there are other times the film veers into antics similar to the hijinxes of the Road Runner, Wylie Coyote, Bugs Bunny, and other Warner Brother characters. Personally, I enjoyed this uneven-style because it grounded the film in reality, while reminding viewers it's just a cartoon.

I thoroughly enjoyed EVERYONE'S HERO. It's a great animated baseball picture with important and strong messages about determination and the importance of family. The film brings recognition to forgotten elements of American history, e.g. the Negro Leagues and hobos. It's a film full of promise and hope. It is also the last project Christopher Reeve worked on before his death and for film buffs the movie is worth watching for that fact alone. But like many of the films Reeve made, EVERYONE'S HERO appeals to a much broader audience, not just children and baseball fans. It's a movie that calls out to the hero in everyone.",1338768000,,3286,4.883512544802867

2738224,4,B000MNOX9E,"It's not difficult to understand why this one wasn't big at the box office - it's not the typical polished, splashy, toilet-humored cartoon that children are accustomed to these days!  If you're looking for something in that vein, you'll want to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a clean, family-friendly cartoon, however, this one should be right up your alley.

I won't repeat the other reviews and give a run-down of the plot - others have done a wonderful job already.  I will tell you that our whole family sat down last night (dad, mom and four children ages 12, 8, 2 and newborn) and watched the whole thing, start to finish.  That doesn't happen very often!  There were two or three unnecessarily foolish moments (what we'd call toilet humor) but I don't recall any sexual double entendres or moments that made me squirm.  I can't say that for many of today's movies.

The parents have a loving relationship, dad and mom work hard (he at the ballpark, she in the home) and the son reacts kindly to neighborhood bullies and has a great love for his parents.  He's not a smart mouth, dad's not a dolt and mom's not a self-centered ding-dong.  How refreshing!

We liked it and, if you're in the market for a kind-hearted (and yes, predictable) movie for the family, you might, too.

2738244,5,B000MNOX9E,"I'm actually shocked that considering the stellar voice cast, this movie wasn't released in cinemas worldwide or received a higher level of recognition. I have to be honest, this movie was just really great, in a sense that I can stick it on and my 13 month old niece would sit in silence for the entire movie and enjoy it. Any movie that can achieve such a feat is alright with me. It's no Pixar masterpiece (which I guess the comparison had to be inevitable with such a movie) but it is in a great league of its own.

The story is set in 1920's New York and focuses around Baseball fan Yankee Irving. He's someone who idolises the legendary Babe Ruth and one day hopes to be as great as he is. One day after another game of Baseball with his friends, he finds a talking Baseball (Rob Reiner) which he calls Screwie. Yankee visits his Dad at the Yankee stadium where he works and his Dad treats him to a tour around the Yankees locker room. The next day the Yankees manager and a police officer visit the Yankee home as the lucky Baseball bat of Babe Ruths has been stolen. This leads to Yankees Dad being fired, but Yankee knows who stole the bat. So he sets on an adventure to find out who really stole the bat and get his dad his job back.

An overall great movie that I honestly feel should have got more recognition than it did.",1218844800,,1334,4.248031496062992

2738250,5,B000MNOX9E,"You could write what I know about baseball on the head of a pin and still have room for some batting averages. What can I say--when I saw that Whoopi Goldberg was doing the voice for a bat, I had to see the film.

Quickly, the young hero of this tale is Yankee Irving, who can't hit a ball to save his life but he still loves baseball and dreams of being great. One day, he discovers a talking baseball in the sandlot.  His father works as a janitor for Yankee Stadium and takes him to see Babe Ruth's bat. As Yankee is drooling, a man he thinks is a janitor comes to steal the bat. Once Yankee realizes the theft cost his Dad his job, he sets out to capture the thief and return the bat on his own.

""Everyone's Hero"" is a film for kids of all ages. The message is inspirational and Yankee Irving is so compelling you want to cheer him on even if you're not sure how the game is played.",1201478400,8,887,4.028409090909091

I personally liked the nostalgia of 1932 - the innocence of a time without kidnappings, high priced ball players and everyone sueing everyone else.

Rob Reiner does a phenomenal job as Screwie the baseball.  Adding that character to the movie created a comedic sidekick that pretty much carried the story.

My kids are 7 and 5 and I was not troubled with anything in this movie.  My 7 year old loved when ""lefty"" would continuously get what was coming to him.",1183939200,,710,4.318181818181818

This movie isn't a blockbuster, but it's very entertaining and safe for everyone.  I even laughed out loud at several parts so it can appeal to the whole family.
