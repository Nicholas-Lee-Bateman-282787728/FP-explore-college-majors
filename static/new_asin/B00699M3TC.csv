Both have exponentially increased my ""productivity,"" if you will, in my personal life. Researching more into Love System products, I found the 11 Essentials DVD Set. I had bought two books already and the thought of having a DVD with the human emotion factor involved really intrigued me.

Once again, like my other review, I needed a pen and paper. It was impossible for me to get all this information down the first time through. Each instructor was very informative in each category and Savoy was very thorough in reviewing every aspect at the end of the DVDs.  A few key notes I took away

  *Social Proof - Savoy goes into detail about how girls make judgments the instant they meet someone. He goes on to tell why it is important, when going out, to get to know staff and people in the area. Showing that people recognize you and that you are someone that the staff knows and remembers will definitely  help your attraction to others.

  *Story Telling - My Favorite section by far. Story Telling was instructed by Tenmagnet. I am a story teller regardless of who I'm talking to. I enjoy telling stories; the buildup, the suspense, the joking end or serious end...all of these things make it easy for me to get people to know me but know me through what I want to share. What I did learn though, is that some of my stories are not actually good stories to tell. Tenmagnet picks apart stories and explains why they are good or bad. It is a section I will continually go back to and reference.

Overall this was a very exciting set for me to watch. It was exciting to see all the different aspects and thought processes of different instructors and how you can just take pieces of each and meld it into your own game. In the end, I took away ways to better myself as a person and that in turn allows for more attraction with women. That seems to be the biggest take away with the books and DVD's that I have bought recently; Bettering yourself and your lifestyle will get you the things you want.",1346889600,,2126,4.456185567010309

I am quite young so when it comes to the ""Dating Younger Women"" dvd, I was not interested, but my opinion of the rests are that they are exceptional. The Don's presentation of Attraction, Future on framing, Cajun on Identity and 5.0 on Social Proof are most impressive. Together, they gave me the picture of how my attractive self should be.

In specific, The Don and Future's presentations were about what factors in the interaction creates attraction, and what frame of mind should you have in order to be attractive and confident in your interaction with women and men. For the Identity DVD, I was impressed and surprised with the content. I expected identity to be something of a ""rock star"" or ""magician"" to be attractive but no, Cajun gave out theories and applications in theater art to highlight your attractive personality (hobbies, ambitions, characters), so the principles can be applied to anyone, without having to fake anything. About Social Proof? I learnt how to walk into the room and how to easily create the optimal impression to have people being open to you approaching them. 5.0 talked in the context of night clubs, but the same principles/mechanisms can be used for daily life as well (your social circle, or people you plan to show a good impression)

If you wonder how the Day Game DVD is, I did to. It was the first DVD I watched actually. Far more superior than anyone I know is Soul. He's chilled & charismatic; his method of doing game is effective and I heard he's going to retire so this is probably one of the gem he leaves. It's a quick lesson but the important elements are included: approaching (how to open), conversation mapping (how to have a fun conversation that gives you further advantage).

I think other DVDs are going to be much useful to your advantages as well. It clears things out (for many reason, and one of  the simplest is that hearing the instructors saying it is much easier to grab the concepts since you don't have to try interpreting with you knowledge and experience on the subject). For me, my focus would be solidifying my understanding of attraction, how it works for me,how to master this feeling and of course, having better and better conversations with people in my life (either new or existing friends)

So, if you are looking for a product that works directly on further developing your attractive personality and habit, I think you found the right page.
