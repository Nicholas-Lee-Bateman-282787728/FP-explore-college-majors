4833855,3,B005M2A4CA,"I purchased the DVD and I must say, the best part is watching Jan Brady bouncing up and down. I never saw her bounce up and down like that on the Brady Bunch.;-)(Think Suzanne Somers on Three's Company)

Otherwise, its pretty boring stuff.",1322092800,8,239,4.558139534883721
4833856,3,B005M2A4CA,"I love the Bradys and always will. However, this show is a mess. I need to forgive that this was filmed in the early seventies but the show on this DVD is incomplete. Apparently, every frame of bowling is not filmed. Because of this, I (and every one who purchased this DVD) missed out on strikes from Peter and Bobby Brady. I would have liked to have seen those. I was going to purchase the regular Celebrity Bowling DVD set but I think I'll pass on it now.",1322006400,12,458,4.215909090909091
4833857,5,B005M2A4CA,my husband and i love the bradys. we watch the series quite often on fridays just like the good old days. what a treat to have the bunch out bowling! fun dvd!,1321315200,5,158,3.96875
4833858,2,B005M2A4CA,"Ahh the Bradys--so great at the Potato Sack Race, Charleston contents, painstakingly constructing a house of cards. But one thing's for sure--they can't bowl worth a hill of beans and this DVD proves it. Barry Williams comes off best and even the female commentator--herself a professional bowler--praises him a few times. But maybe that was just in hopes he'd take her back to that groovy attic bachelor pad for some ""private lessons"".

Seriously though, if you are a fanatic about watching really bad bowlers from the '70s do their thing for 45 minutes, then this DVD is for you. Otherwise, even the most rabid Brady fan will be bored.

The disc contains two separate shows: the first one features Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick vs. Chris Knight and Eve Plumb. The second show it's Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen vs. Eric Scott and Mary McDonough from ""The Waltons"". The picture quality isn't the best but it's very watchable. C'mon though--did they really think there was going to be a market for these 40 years down the road? I give 'em a pass on quality. (NOTE--see the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product).

Two stars: One because they're the Bradys and the kids make some respectful comments about Robert Reed and Florence Henderson; and two, because it is slightly amusing to hear host Jed Allan constantly screwing up their names as the confused kids are never sure who he's talking to or which lane they're to play. The prizes include some of the ugliest men's pants you've ever seen, an archaic telephone answering machine and of course, the ubiquitous case of Turtle Wax. Perhaps the kids would have practised or tried harder if their precious books of trading stamps were at stake.",1320624000,27,1725,4.820945945945946
4833859,4,B005M2A4CA,"Here we have the Brady Kids on ""Celebrity Bowling"" after their 5th season of the ""Brady Bunch."" You'll notice that these kids, except for Greg ( Barry Williams) never get out of the house much and ever bowl! Lots of gutter balls here! But @$5 it's fun to watch if you were a fan of the series like myself! I enjoy the professional bowler on the microphone trying to help the kids after so many gutter balls!",1408320000,4,407,4.298701298701299
4833860,5,B005M2A4CA,"THis is beyond cheesy, but wow, just to have this is worth it.  Eve, and Barry are quite good.....Maureen has some moments.  Christopher isn't that bad.....",1393545600,,156,4.961538461538462
4833861,4,B005M2A4CA,"VERY odd production but worth it.  I watched this alone and sober, which was probably not using this video to its fullest advantage.  The hairstyles indicate this episode was filmed during  the Oliver era but it seems they left him at home (thankfully).",1386720000,9,253,4.837209302325581
4833862,5,B005M2A4CA,"Is a good comedy you can watch anytime and good for families too ,it is a classic tv show I can recommend it",1381708800,3,108,3.739130434782609
4833863,5,B005M2A4CA,"Different sort of DVD...where you get to see the Brady Kids just being themselves, not as actors. But there wasn't a big difference than the characters they played on TV. They really played real kids, not stereotypical parts. Fun to watch for a serious Brady Fan.",1379721600,4,263,4.739130434782608
4833864,3,B005M2A4CA,"This is actually a couple of episodes of Celebrity Bowling, a game show that ran through the early to mid-70s.  Its premise was to have various celebrities from stage, screen, and television show off their bowling skills (of lack of) while playing for prizes for pre-selected audience members.

The first episode has Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick squaring off against Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb (Greg, Marcia, Peter, and Jan respectively).  So who's going to play against Mike Lookinland (Bobby) and Susan Olsen (Cindy)?  I suppose the producers placed a call to the set of The Waltons and found out that Mary McDonough (Erin) and Eric Scott (Ben) were available, so the younger kids got themselves a game!

You won't find too much excitement or any great moments in bowling history (although Barry did show some promise), but it's not a bad viewing for the price.  It's nice to see the Bradys and a couple of the Waltons off their respective sets for a change, but if you're a fan of neither (especially the Bradys), you probably won't enjoy this much, if at all.",1378944000,6,1077,4.826086956521739
4833865,3,B005M2A4CA,"Look, you know from the title whether this is something you would enjoy - it's exactly what it promises, no more, no less. I thought it was fun, but it's not the kind of program that will get a lot of repeat views.",1367884800,,214,4.0
4833866,5,B005M2A4CA,"It was nice to see them doing something that wasn't a Brady show or special.  Just being normal people out for some bowling.  I love to bowl myself and The Brady Bunch is one of my favorite shows, so this was a great purchase.  I love watching it.",1358553600,,247,4.104166666666667
4833867,5,B005M2A4CA,This is a funny show that they show on who they are bowling for and I do  watch it all the time,1357948800,,95,3.3181818181818183
4833868,4,B005M2A4CA,"Good Brady related video.  They are not the greatest bowlers, but good video.  If you like/love the Bradys you will probably like this video.",1355702400,,141,4.833333333333333

8478969,5,B005M2A4CA,"Thanks to S'more Entertainment, we have titles like the Brady Bunch Bowling and the incredible Paul Lynde Halloween Special (which must be seen to be believed). To all the low reviewers um, seriously, were you expecting award winning entertainment here? It's a local Los Angeles BOWLING TV SHOW, get over yourselves please. It seems S'more Entertainment has stopped releasing DVDs which is a real shame. Unless these time capsules are preserved, they'll ultimately be lost forever. Maybe they need a kickstarter fund to get more things out of obscurity? Support this company and buy their releases!!",1458518400,,599,5.25

8478971,5,B005M2A4CA,"I am an original Brady Bunch viewer from 1969 when the show first premiered on television.  It was the most talked about show among us kids at the time and my generation still holds these kids dear to their hearts.  Our parents might not have understood the Brady kids but we sure did. Almost 50 years later I still watch the show and anything related to it.  Watching the Brady kids on ""Celebrity Bowling"" is a real treat. I'm glad I bought it. Will buy the Brady Bunch Variety Hour when they release the complete series on DVD.",1434412800,3,529,4.377551020408164

He put it in the blu ray player immediately & we watched it.  Fantastic that the Brady's compete with the Waltons.  Sitcom stars seemed so ""normal"" back then.
