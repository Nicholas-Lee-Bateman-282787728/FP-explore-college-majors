8100080,4,B000CPHA1A,Not for kids this should be rated MA. This is a 5 DVD set I already have the other 4 and needed this one to complete the set. This is a very funny series for both teens and adult. Well worth owning the complete set. PS the english dub is very well done.,1334880000,,253,3.792452830188679
8100081,5,B000CPHA1A,SO HILARIOUS! One of the best anime series ever - this is probably the only dub I can really appreciate! Sooo funny!!!,1226188800,,118,4.409090909090909
8100082,3,B000CPHA1A,"Whenever something really good comes along, expectations for the follow-up are extremely high. Whenever these expectations aren't met, the term used to describe it is ""sophomore slump."" Seeing as the second volume of Ghost Stories was about as funny as you can get, it was inevitable that a dip in quality show up at some part of the series. In Ghost Stories vol 3: Junior Jitters, the dip is here and boy is it steep. While most of the episodes have their moments of laugh-out-loud humor, the humor to non-humor ratio is seriously unbalanced. The problem seems to be that in this batch of episodes, the original intent was more or less to pull on the heart strings so the all the jokes just don't mesh well with two of the episodes. The episodes about the ghost of the dead cab-driver and the death of Satsuki's mother have some funny jokes, but most of the humor just falls flat. The episodes that aren't trying to get the viewers bawl like a pregnant woman watching lifetime, are a little better but never reach the humor factor of previous volumes. One of these episodes involves a animal obsessed girl reviving a dead rabbit ala Pet Cemetary and the other finds Satsuki being harassed by an evil doll.

As Ghost Stories is an episodic series, I think that if you are on a tight budget you could definitely skip this volume. On the whole it's meh.",1150848000,,1351,4.559670781893004
8100083,3,B000CPHA1A,"Ok, normally I am very happy with ADV dubbing but this series goes way off track when it comes to representing the Japanese original.  For example, in the original Japanese this volume shows a sad story about a cab driver who loves his daugther and tragically dies on his way home on her birthday.  In the english, father is a drunk who abuses his daughter.  It's just not funny anymore.  The first volume was funny I'd admit, but by the second volume it became rapidly inappropriate.  If you love constant fart and sexually explicit jokes, as well as constant cursing, by all means watch it with the english dubbing.  But if you want to know what this anime is actually about, watch it in Japanese with it's english subtitles.",1143849600,,727,4.596899224806202
8100084,5,B000CPHA1A,"When you see this volume, you might feel that's like another film stuff, ""Pet cemetery"" or ""Child's play"" for example... some of these episodes are actually pretty alike.
but sure, this is not imitation, because this is based on stories of Japanese children's Rumors for long years, they have been influenced in unconsciously from grown-ups told these classic scary story's script.
anyway, I appreciate the working of the ADV and voice actors and voice actress to amuse me, it's very very funny!
I enjoyed bran-new scary comedy storis!
I can't wait for the next volume.",1140825600,,569,5.0
