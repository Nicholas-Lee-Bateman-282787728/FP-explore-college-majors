2057778,3,B00023BN42,"Well this Special wasn't all that great once Elmo's World took over the whole special. Yes it was complelty way too focused on Elmo and less on the Important Charcters like Big Bird, Oscor, and Grover. There were a few scenes in which they showed some scenes from a few of the 35 years.

-The Begining Of the Elmo's World Thing.

-At End Of the show which they show that five to ten minute clip show. Which was great! (TV Version Only)

-When Elmo and Grover go through Time and stuff.

In all They could have really done better in making this special with the characters that are kind of more enjoyble then Elmo, and who were the starts back then.",1106524800,,648,4.330578512396694
2057779,1,B00023BN42,"Wow, do I miss the sesame street from when it was good!!  The Dvd wasn't like the TV show that PBS aired.  The TV show had a 5-10 minute segmant on scenes from sesame street from the beginning of the show until now, the DVD din't do that at all, and that was the reason I bought the DVD!  They have a split second of Mr. Hooper, they briefly show Maria and Louis getting married, didn't bother to show them meeting for guacamole for the first time, they showed when miles was adopted, but don't bother to point out olivia.  They don't talk about when Gina came to sesame street.  This is not a reminisant look back at all.  It's let's put out yet another elmo dvd, and dumb down the show even more.  I think that the only thing you learn in this episode is the one song about counting to 10.  Don't bother with this one, if you want to reminise, go pick up a copy of christmas eve on sesame street.",1104796800,5,898,4.120689655172414
2057780,1,B00023BN42,"Ok, I know that as an 18 year old I should not have gone out and bought it.  But I did.  Everything I had read or heard about it led me to believe that it was a retrospective.  It even says 35th Anniversary Special on the case.  Once you watch it though, you realize that it is one giant plug for the little red beast who ruined a really good seires, Elmo.  There was almost no reminiscence in the episode.  You got five minutes at the end, with only a brief little blur that could have been Mr. Hooper.  For a show that taught children how to deal with a lot of difficult issues, and where everything turned out okey-dokey in the end, this was a highly disapointing video.  Parents, think twice before you support a show that is no longer what it used to be in it's glory days.  Everyone else, don't even touch this, it isn't worth it.",1102550400,7,836,4.175
2057781,5,B00023BN42,"This is as classic -- but although it's wonderful, keep in mind that you'll probably love it more than your kid!  It's a great musical ""review"" -- but if you child doesn't stay ""hooked"" for the musical portions (like our 10 month old), it may not be the ideal choice.  It has great old scenes and again, you'll love it -- but it's for your kid, right?  If your child prefers mainly Elmo (and who doesn't?), then I recommend Elmo's World - Flowers, Bananas & More (the ""Hair"" portion is absolutely hysterical! -- for both adults and kids alike -- that's the ""& More"" in the title).  So if you child loves seeing the kids and characters -- and mainly Elmo -- interact, save this one for purchase until after you get the more exclusive Elmo DVDs (or tapes).  Also, I also wanted to mention that (from my experience) it appears that PBS does play a different version(s) than this DVD -- they appear to ""mix and match"" segments -- so if you Tivo or VHS -- tape the PBS version(s) -- which as a side note is always easier to start playing than dealing w/ a DVD player -- for example when the disc isn't in there or if you have a multi-disc player like we have -- and you still have to remember which disc it is, etc. -- Tivo is a wonderful option -- and since there aren't commercials during the actual Sesame Street shows (even though our child loves the commercials in between episodes) -- makes it an even better option.  Hope this helped!",1102032000,,1436,4.33955223880597
2057782,5,B00023BN42,"My son has loved this video from the first time he watched it!  He doesn't care to sit and watch any other program, but he'll sit still (miracle) and watch this entire one!  (he's 15 months)",1101600000,,190,4.25
2057783,5,B00023BN42,"My 11 month old son and my 2 year old nephew just love this DVD. Yes, it's the same show that ran on the PBS stations. And if you taped it, then you don't need to purchase it. But if you didn't tape, you need to own this DVD.  If your kid loves Elmo, they will love this program.  And I think it's should be part of any kids collection since it celebrates Sesame Street. It shows you how things have changed over the years.  It's a must have!",1098144000,4,442,3.943820224719101
2057784,4,B00023BN42,"When this aired on PBS the whole family watched it and we taped it. However, the version you get on DVD is a bit different. On the original showing on PBS, at the end of the show you saw clips from the very first episode, to when Snuffy came to Sesame Street, to when Big Birds house was damaged by the hurricane. I truely thought that was a great segment to have all those little clips as a sort of time machine. However, the DVD does not have this scene in it. Don't get me wrong, there are still a good number of older skits and cartoons, but in all actuality it's pretty much an hour long Elmo's world. My kids happen to love Elmo, so they don't mind, however in my opinion, I thought the 25th anniversary video was better. All in all, this is still a great video and almost a must for any Sesame Street fan.",1097625600,10,812,4.113207547169812
2057785,4,B00023BN42,"My children have recently started watching Sesame Street, and I haven't seen it since I was a kid in the early 70s.  My kids like it because it's Elmo, and I found it helpful in introducing me to the new characters (both people and muppets) introduced in the intervening period.",1095811200,,278,4.56
2057786,3,B00023BN42,"I was thinking when I saw it on the network, that they were going to be showing a lot of history from Sesame Street. Elmo's World pretty much takes over a lot of the show and you only see very very short clips with Elmo riding in a taxi cab.
They have some clips that some may remember growing up for representing the number of the day, which is 10.
They have very short clips at the ending that show the years of Sesame Street that some may remember. Like when Mr. Hooper died, when Snuffy became real, and the Hurricane on Sesame Street.
I have nothing against the little red monster, but I was expecting a little bit more history, and a little less Elmo. When I was growing up, Big Bird and Oscar and Mister Snuffleupagus were the stars.
May Sesame Street have many more years to come. 35 years and one to grow on. ^_^",1087862400,15,821,4.2025316455696204
2057787,5,B00023BN42,"My Niece is 2 and a handful, but I lover her to death and she loves Elmo to death.  This dvd is a great addition to her collection.",1360368000,,131,3.6785714285714284
2057788,4,B00023BN42,"Well,
Elmo is great, and we all know that Elmo's World cannot hold the attention of an adult, but I was really disappointed with this one. You get the idea that they are going to show you the history of Sesame Street, but it turns out that it's just a few clips of the older shows with Super Grover narrating. It seems like Grover took over Elmo's World, and that's just not nice. My two year old daughter loves it, but I'm not a big fan.",1355788800,,438,4.104651162790698
2057789,5,B00023BN42,we watched it over and over and over again.  I think i memorized it word for word.  can't wait till my younger son gets into elmo.,1326153600,,130,3.9615384615384617
2057790,5,B00023BN42,The street we live on is a great look at the recent and past Sesame Street friends with some great animation from way back. Its essentially a 52 minute Elmo's World episode but is a lot of fun.,1315699200,,193,4.105263157894737
2057791,5,B00023BN42,"My three-year-old son is obsessed with Elmo and has been for some time.  For him, Elmo and his World are extremely age appropriate, and I understand why he loves the Elmo's World format with its routines, predictable characters and possibility for audience participation.  For the adult, however, Elmo with his high-pitched voice and more straightforward (and less humorous) approach isn't quite as enjoyable.

This is an exception.  Yes, Elmo is the ""host"" here and the Elmo's World format is loosely followed, but the focus is on Sesame Street, and it's a very good introduction to all of the major characters who live there, with the added plus of a little sentimental journeying to the Sesame Street pre-Elmo.

The sketches here are all quite enjoyable.  My favorites are ""C is for Cookie"" done operatic style, Grover and his peacock friend, Ming, and, of course, Ernie and Bert singing ""Boogie Woogie Sheep"" complete with montage of past celebrity visitors dancing and otherwise performing.  Lots of humor here.

No, this is not a complete retrospective.  Sesame Street just released the first volume of Sesame Street Old School for viewers who want to revisit classic Sesame Street.  But it's an enjoyable visit to a favorite place, even on the fifth or fifteenth viewing.  My son has several other Elmo's World DVD's and this is the one he really wants to watch - over and over and over.

One caveat: unfortunately, this DVD is formatted so you have to watch a Whoopi Goldberg-voiced appeal for Sesame Street at the beginning of it.  You can't forward through it or access the menu until it's done playing.  It has to be watched.  And, unlike other Elmo's World DVD's, the program doesn't start by itself.  Which basically means you, the adult, has to watch this commercial all the way through every time your child watches this program.",1170460800,,1844,4.919093851132686
2057792,4,B00023BN42,"I understand some readers' comments about this DVD being more like the current Sesame Street shows than a real retrospective of when we were kids...but if it were FOR us, then that would matter more to me.  I like it because my 2 year-old is obsessed with Elmo, and can barely make it through segments without him in it.  If this were more history-oriented, it wouldn't make it into the DVD player more than once!  That said, I liked it because it uses the familiar Elmo's World format to show what Sesame Street is about, and how Elmo relates to his ""world"" around him.",1168732800,,570,4.461538461538462
2057793,5,B00023BN42,"My daughter and I love this dvd, because it has some classic Sesame Street moments and shows some new soon to be classic moments with current actors & actresses. We love the Chinese girls doing the peacock dance and seeing that Miles joined his family through adoption.

As parents who grew up watching Sesame Street I think it's hard to include what we each fondly remember - such as Mr. Hooper, the cream pie guy and when Snuffy was only seen by Big Bird. Especially when we want to share our a little piece of our childhood with our children. I do think they did job considering all of the years and wonderful shows.

We 2 Sesame Street dvds and there is no way around the Sesame Street's spokes woman Whoppi Goldberg. She just states that children all around the world  profit when you purchase Sesame Street items. Our daughter at 2 loved the intro and seeing all the different children from around the world, could it be stressful to both parent and child who is younger who wants to watch it now.... YES.",1139356800,,1011,4.483695652173913
2057794,5,B00023BN42,"This was our first Sesame Street/Elmo video, and when our 4-month old saw it for the first time, she lost all interest in Baby Einstein (except for the Day on the Farm one).  We now have about 10-12 more Sesame Street DVDs, thinking more of a good thing has to be good--but this one has remained her favorite.  She is 11 months now and still claps and smiles at her favorite parts.  She seems to prefer the Sesame Street DVDs that have one or a few ""themes"".  This one starts out with Grover delivering an important ""package"" to Oscar, then it's followed by a series of ""cookie"" themes (including the familiar ""C is for Cookie"" song), and my personal favorite, the peacock that won't do the peacock dance despite Grover's showing him a training film made in China of little girls doing the peacock dance.  It's great to have this to completely entertain our baby when I need that--or to hold her in my lap while she watches it, mesmerized.",1121558400,,939,4.5
2057795,2,B00023BN42,"Plain and Simple - when a show hits 35 years the people that made the show should be smart enough to realize that Parents who saw the show as Kids want their own Kids to watch what they had watched - to share memories with them.

In this case, its yet another Elmo video.  Fine, OK, things change.  But don't misrepresent what you're going to see - I really wanted to show my boy Mr. Hooper, and the guy with the pies that slips down the stairs, and when they thought Snuffy wasn't real, and all the old characters.

The stuff is on tape Sesame Street Execs - can you please put out ""Sesame Street - Best of Season 1, 2, 3?  I'd buy everything from Season 1 - Season 6.  I bet I wouldn't be the only one either....

Please put out some older Sesame material....  Don't slip in a few seconds of Mr. Hooper in an Elmo tape.",1111795200,13,821,4.0875
