8350857,5,B0024OW20Q,"""One must sorrow that a man of such genius should be a drunken clown.""

Kino's useful boxed set brings together four of their silent John Barrymore releases that show the star at the peak of his powers, albeit to varying effect.

1928 silent Tempest may not be a great picture but it is a great star vehicle for a star in his prime before drink and self-parody took their toll on his reputation. In fact, it's richly ironic that in one of those art-predicting-life moments it's drink and a scandal involving a woman's honor that causes John Barrymore's peasant-made-officer's downfall in this lavish romance set in the period before and during the Russian Revolution. If you're only familiar with the Barrymore of later years, this is a revelation, the Great Profile seen at his best, with a gravitas and intensity that he wears lightly, devilishly good looking and confident but not arrogant with it. The perfect movie hero, it's easy to see why he was such a major influence on the young Errol Flynn. Indeed, in one sequence on a horse in a river you could almost be looking at Flynn in his prime.

The film itself is romantic hokum, but executed with real conviction and produced on a lavish scale. Barrymore's a peasant cavalryman from the wrong side of the Urals, no socialist or red but no fan of the aristocracy either, who manages to become the first commissioned officer to rise from the ranks in a decade thanks to George Fawcett's paternalistic general only to lose his rank and his honor thanks to an unfortunate but innocent indiscretion with the general's daughter (Camilla Horn) who publicly loathes him so much you know it must be love. Throughout he's shadowed by Boris de Fast's strikingly spectral Bolshevik peddler who acts like a nagging devil on his shoulder as his disillusionment is fuelled and he ultimately finds his niche deciding who's going to be lined up against the wall after the Revolution. Naturally redemption and true love will enter into it, but not before the filmmakers have expressed their dismay with both sides - the aristocrats, exemplified by Ulrich Haupt's von Stroheim-lite villain (Erich von Stroheim was an uncredited writer on the picture) who stubs his cigarettes out on lowly NCO Louis Wolheim's neck and then berates him for ruining a perfectly good cigarette, and the Bolsheviks who respond with even greater cruelty in the vivid conveyer-belt-like execution scenes. The only chance the hero and heroine have for a happy ending in this kind of world is to escape their own country and leave it forever, a situation that would have struck home with the many White Russian exiles in Hollywood at the time.

The film's ably directed by Sam Taylor (with uncredited scenes by Lewis Milestone and Viktor Tourjansky) with a strong and imaginative eye for composition - there's a particularly striking execution scene played in the time it takes to open and close a door, and Charles Rosher's superb camerawork and William Cameron Menzies' production work together to good effect even in the occasionally worn surviving prints, the film opening with a lavish tracking shot around a model of a garrison town before melding it almost flawlessly to a real set in a single camera movement. The ballroom sequence is particularly outstanding, with the socially ostracised Barrymore entering the brightly lit ball silhouetted in the foreground and later drunkenly watching his `betters' while their dancing reflections can be seen in the silverware in front of him. And when he finds himself facing years in solitary confinement, the walls of his cell become a giant movie screen on which he can see images of his comrades fighting at the front and the woman he loves laughing at him as he goes mad. They may not make them like this any more, but thankfully while prints still survive we can at least still see those they did.

Kino's DVD has no extras but boasts a fine transfer.

It's hard to disagree with Orson Welles, who idolised John Barrymore, that the great man is not at his best in The Beloved Rogue, but the film has so much else going for it than the lead performance that it works surprisingly well despite his going down with a particularly virulent strain of drunken Douglas Fairbanksitis. As Francois Villon, the 15th century French poet and rogue caught between the machinations of the beleaguered and devious king and the ruthlessly ambitious and devious Duke of Burgundy, he's clearly making a grab not just for the people's crown as King of the Fools but Fairbanks crown as King of the Swashbucklers, sliding from rooftop to rooftop, climbing and jumping from castles, springing over city walls through bedroom windows from catapults and also, unfortunately, hamming, overacting and prancing around as if Paris was the Yellow Brick Road and he was off to see the Wizard, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz...

It's a shame, because it's the best role Errol Flynn never played (and one that Ronald Colman did, in If I Were King, as did several others from Yul Brynner on TV to Oreste in the forgotten MGM musical The Vagabond King) and had his Don Juan director Alan Crosland been able to reign him in, one that Barrymore had the ability to play much better. But Barrymore just seems content to play to the gallery, act the drunken fool and thumb his nose at the supporting players when he was capable of so much more at that time in his career - he gets the balance between swashbuckling, comedy and romantic dignity right in Don Juan, but this seems to owe more to bottled spirits than high spirits, sending up his own Hell-raising image at the expense of the part and, at times, the film.

The supporting cast are more successful, among them Conrad Veidt doing a Lon Chaney twisted and superstitious King Louis the Little, Marceline Day making a little bit more of the romantic interest than is in the script and future Freaks co-stars Henry Victor and Angelo Rossitto (and yes, there is gratuitous dwarf kicking involved), while the filmmakers get great comic mileage out of Dick Sutherland's remarkable features as the executioner Tritran L'Hermite. Yet despite Paul Bern's script replacing Villon's own poetry with simple doggerel and never quite showing enough wit and invention for a hero who survived dangerous times through wit and invention, the film still manages you to carry you along without feeling cheated (though the ending is a bit underwhelming) and, thanks to Joseph August's cinematography and William Cameron Menzies' production design, the film certainly looks a treat: the King of Fools sequence may make ample use of Universal's full-scale Hunchback of Notre Dame sets, but Menzies puts his stamp on the film in the snow swept side streets of a city in the midst of winter that gives it a feeling part vivid storybook, part reality that's where the film's real poetry is to be found.

Kino's Region 1 NTSC DVD offers an acceptable print with the only extra a brief and cursory introduction by Orson Welles filmed for a TV screening and which is in far worse condition than the film itself!

Despite being one of his signature screen roles, John Barrymore's hugely successful 1920 version of Robert Louis Stevenson's oft-filmed tale is far from the definitive one - for that you'd have to see the 1931 Rouben Mamoulian-Frederic March film, which is still striking today. Despite a few moments of censor-baiting child cruelty and sexual exploitation, it's a rather flat adaptation, with Barrymore the main attraction. His Jekyll may be a bit of a milquetoast, but the ham in him knows that Hyde is the real meat-and-potatoes for an actor, and he devours it readily, showcasing his own remarkable makeup-free initial transformation achieved with little more than some expressive scrunching of his own features and some subtle lighting that is extraordinarily successful (later shots of him fully transformed did take advantage of some monster makeup, however). It's a party trick Barrymore repeated, perhaps even more successfully, in a scene in his later Don Juan, but where that had a great film built around it, here the transformations at times feel too much like the whole show. And it's certainly worth the price of a ticket at least once, even if the film itself is distinctly average even for its day.

As one of the most popular Public Domain titles on the DVD market, there's no shortage of truly terrible transfers - most poor prints, often running at the wrong speed, sometimes incomplete and often with hideous and irrelevant scores - so it's worth noting that Kino's Region 1 NTSC DVD release is probably the best version we'll ever get. Aside from a good print at the right speed, it also comes with copious and always relevant extras - an extract from the rival and much cheaper 1920 Sheldon Lewis version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde that was offered to exhibitors who couldn't afford the more expensive Barrymore version, an early Stan Laurel short film Dr Pyckle and Mr Pride, detailed production notes that are far from the usual PR fluff you get on DVDs as well as a rare 1909 audio recording of a particularly hammy stage version of `The Transformation Scene.' It may cost a bit more, but it's worth it.

Movies have been taking liberties with Conan Doyle's creation long before Guy Ritchie, with the Great Profile's 1922 silent take on the Great Detective, Sherlock Holmes (aka Moriarty), a modern-day version ill-advisedly rewriting the book in a manner that offended the purists while not coming up with anything new to appeal to the more casual moviegoer, then or now. Partially shot on location in London and opening with some striking overhead shots of the city, it's not as terrible as its reputation nor as good as it should be considering all the talent and money involved (Reginald Denny, Louis Wolheim and future gossip queen Hedda Hopper are in it as well). Revolving around a blackmail attempt and some love letters to a European Prince from the woman who killed herself when they were prevented from marrying, it's at times a talky script, always a problem in a silent film, with more of a taste for melodrama than sleuthing.

A very loose adaptation of William Gillette's play, it begins with Holmes and Watson as fellow university students, charting his first encounter with Moriarty (on learning the fate of various detectives who have tried to bring him to book, Holmes responds ""Oh! - Well, of course, if you're as difficult to know as all that, I'd better be getting back to my microbes"") that sets him on a life of fighting crime. But along the way we get Holmes rustically ruminating on human nature and, of all things, falling in love at first sight with Carol Dempster's innocent girl and spending much of the first half of the film in a daze. Or it could be plain disinterest as Barrymore hardly seems terribly engaged with his role, going through the motions of concentrating and staring into the far distance while making little impression. Not that he has much to work with, Holmes going by instinct rather than deductive reasoning - `It's easier for me to know Wells is guilty than to explain how I know it' he admits early in the game - while only briefly demonstrating his deductive reasoning in a scene with a clumsily shaved Roland Young's underemployed Watson. As for the domestic revelation in the last scene, it's enough to give the hardcore Holmes fans a fit, though it is rather obvious that Barrymore's real-life hatred for co-star Dempster led to him insisting on a stand in for her in their final clinch.

Holmes isn't the only one to get a bit of a makeover. Gustav Von Seyffertitz's scruffy Moriarty, introduced in the middle of a spider's web and operating from a torture dungeon in Limehouse, seems inspired more by Barrymore's Mr Hyde than Doyle while, aside from a paperboy in the unsatisfactorily perfunctory ending, the closest it gets to a Baker Street Irregular is William Powell in his first film as a thief who defects to Holmes' side and whose fate is left vague for much of the last part of the film by the still missing footage. Whereby hangs a tale.

The film was lost for decades until the negative of several cans of out of order sequences were found in George Eastman House in 1970, with Kevin Brownlow and William K. Everson screening them for director Albert Parker and basing the lengthy restoration (funded by Hugh Hefner and the National Parks Foundation among others over more than three decades) on his notes. Unfortunately things get rather confusing towards the end thanks to some still missing footage: where public screenings of the restoration filled in the gaps with stills and explanatory captions, Kino Video's extras-free DVD from 2008 makes no such concessions, with events around Holmes' second encounter with Moriarty particularly abrupt (a wounded man and a rejected proposition referred to in one title card literally come out of nowhere while another segment ends abruptly). One for the Barrymore and Holmes completists only, though it is amusing to note that even in 1922 films were making in-jokes about evil masterminds wasting time on elaborate death traps rather than simply killing their nemesis the easy way.",1401926400,3,13188,4.865538735529831
8350858,3,B0024OW20Q,"The thrill of the initial announcement for this is slightly dimineshed by the contents of the set.  The big news of the press release was that the long-lost Sherlock Holmes is finally coming to home video.  Some of us were wondering if it would considering the restored reconstuction was almost 10 years ago in 2001.  I can only speculate that the long delay must have been financial or legal, since this was a bare-bones release.  That's a shame too, since there are volumes of extras that could have been easily created about this particular film, the character Sherlock Holmes, or the actors.  In addition to John Barrymore, the film also contains the debuts of William Powell and Roland Young; a simple featurette could have pointed them out to the unfamiliar.  I think the most glaring omission is about the history of the film.  For being a lost film for years, the reconstruction was a challenge not because of limited available materials, but instead because the elements surviving included EVERY take jumbled out of order.  Theoretically, there is a lot of material out there that didn't make it onto the DVD, it would have been nice to see some of that here.  Lastly, this film, and the other releases new to Kino in this set, present a new trend in minimal menus that I'm not very fond of, with about 6 chapter selections listed right on the main menu.  Granted, there aren't many extras in the set that they could have branched to, but even when there are, those are still just on the main menu.  This trend is reminiscent of the early days of DVD, when not every DVD had menus or chapter selections.  Even on past releases with no extra features, Kino displayed a main menu and more sophisticated chapter selections.

As for the other films, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde is the most available of all four, and the DVD with the most extra features in this set.  While the extras make it superior to all competitors, they do not feature John Barrymore, but rather the history of the Jekly and Hide productions.  Also, this DVD has been previously available from Kino and is found in another box set.  While I love Kino, that does irritate me a little, since that practice only seems convenient for people who don't buy many of their products.  In other words, it already seems like it's not a product made for people like me.

The Beloved Rogue and Tempest were both already available from Image Entertainment.  The Kino edition of the Beloved Rogue has an improved image quality and adds an extra feature, an introduction by Orson Welles from the 70's; the piano score is also apparently still the same used in home video since the 70's.  The Kino edition of Tempest, however, has no special features unlike the Image edition, which included home movies of John Barrymore on his yacht, ""Vagabonding on the Pacific"".

I really wanted to be able to rate this set higher, but i feel it has some shortcomings as a product.  For Barrymore fans, Sherlock Holmes is probably the main appeal, but if you're a long-time Barrymore fan then you've probably already purchased some of the existing DVDs on the market.  If so, then you probably don't need to double dip here, just buy Sherlock Holmes, especially now that it's on Blu-ray.  I can't quite understand Kino's decision not to add anything else to films that are already available on home video--in some cases apparently recycling existing musical scores!  Perhaps it's just me, and maybe I've been spoiled by stellar DVD releases of silent films, but I don't see why any film from the silent era wouldn't deserve extra features to add appeal and also put them in context.  I don't want to judge the product too harshly on content I feel is absent, but on the other hand, it's difficult to recommend this set on the content that is included.  Still, Kino is reknowned for quality silent DVD releases, and the transfers here would only disappoint the strictest critics.  As long as you're aware that this product is almost limited to just quality film transfers and aren't expecting fully loaded DVDs, then this set won't disappoint.",1261094400,5,4085,4.715492957746479
8350859,5,B0024OW20Q,"No one breaks my heart more than this man. Barrymore is more pathetic than tragic, but he still devastates me. When I see him in ""Twentieth Century"" I am breathless. Even in the worst films that he made, the glimmer of his talent still shines through, however dimly.  On every level, this man had it all, but just couldn't overcome the enormous self-destructive streak that was innate. When I see the heights he climbed to, I feel so much sadness about his dissolute life and tumble to the depths. ""Dinner at Eight"" and ""Grand Hotel"" are fun, but don't miss ""Topaze"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" - or ""Eternal Love"", or his Sherlock Holmes.  My favorite will always be Oscar Jaffe, though.  What a creation! What's tragic is that his great stage performances as Hamlet and Richard III could not be filmed at that time.",1248393600,3,819,4.595890410958904
8350860,5,B0024OW20Q,"Kino is releasing a new four-DVD box set with four films of the silent era starring legendary John Barrymore. Nice going Kino. In 1925, John Barrymore reprised his Broadway stage production of ""Hamlet"" in London. Also in 1925, he signed a two-picture contract with Joseph Schenck of United Artists, and in the next two years he produced ""The Beloved Rogue"" and ""The Tempest(though Barrymore earned only $2,000 per week as compared to the $10,000 per week he had earned at Warner Bros.)"". Both of these films are part of this new collection.
First up is ""Sherlock Holmes"", based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story.
The film follows the famous Broadway play, including Homles' early days, in which he decides to study criminology. Holmes comes face-to-face with arch enemy Professor Moriarty(Gustav von Seyffertitz). A young William
 Powell has a small role in his first Hollywood movie. ""Sherlock Holmes"" was shot, in part, on location in London and Switzerland. Watch for a scene with Barrymore strolling along the Thames near the London Bridge. Director Albert Parker later complained of Barrymore's drinking during the production. Though Barrymore is fine, the movie suffers from lengthy subtitles, and the pace is sadly tedious. This is the first official release of the 1922 ""Sherlock Holmes"", on either VHS or DVD, but avid collectors have had access to it for several years. ""Sherlock Holmes"" was believed to be a lost film, until a battered print surfaced in the 1970's. It was recovered by film historian James Card, and a restored version was fashioned by George Eastman House Motion Pictures, where Card was working. 1922. B & W. Full-Frame. (1.33:1).
Second is ""The Beloved Rogue"", with Barrymore as famous Parisian poet/vagabond Francois Villon. Crotchety King Louis XI(Conrad Veidt) appoints Villon king for one day. Villon uses the opportunity to rouse the thieves, tramps, and trollops of Paris to defend the walled city against the invading Burgundians. In 1927, Barrymore wrote: ""I want my next picture to be something different. Villon was a creative poet, and everything happened in his head"".  Barrymore's performance is athletic, as he glides down a banister, and scales castle walls. In one scene, he flexes while being tortured, wearing nothing but a loin cloth. But the film's highpoint is the clown sequence. Crowned King of Fools, Villon is dressed in clown costume; white face, red nose, and bald head. First he is exuberant. But the King considers his actions as disrespectful, and Villon is banished from his beloved Paris. Barrymore as Villon here was never more expressive or touching. The camera moves in to record each facial movement. This is rarefied, transcendent acting you will never forget. No classic posing of grief. No grand shedding of tears. But only Barrymore's face, as a great actor disappears in the throes of overwheming artistry. The lavish sets of ""The Beloved Rogue"" were designed by William Cameron Menzies, who worked on ""Gone With the Wind"". This film was one of 13 aired in 1971 on public television as part of ""The Silent Years"" program, hosted by Orson Welles. Here also,is the show's filmed introduction by Orson Welles, a friend of Barrymore. 1927. Color Tinted. 98 minutes. Full-Frame (1.33:1).
Next is ""The Tempest"", which is set before, during, and after the Russian Revolution. Barrymore plays a Czarist military officer who is rejected by an aristocrat(played by German actress Camilla Horn). Horn had the female lead in Murnau's ""Faust(1926)"". She goes so far as to toss him into prison. In one scene, Barrymore is bare-chested, still handsome at age 46. It was a happy time for Barrymore during production of ""The Tempest"", as he enjoyed time with his new wife, Dolores Costello. Yet, despite this, and his financial prosperity, he continued to drink heavily. The studio signed White Russian Vyatcheslav Tourjansky to direct, but he was replaced by Lewis Milestone. Finally, Sam Taylor took over, and he was given screen credit. A screenplay by Erich von Stroheim was used, but after completion, Stroheim insisted that his name be removed from the credits.
1928. B & W. 111 minutes. Full-Frame (1.22:1).
Finally, there is ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", the first great American horror film, directed by John S. Robertson, and Barrymore's perhaps most famous silent movie role. This version of ""Jekyll"" is one of the most faithful to Stevenson's short story(despite the addition of Ziegfield Follies show-girl Nita Naldi). It is the story of one scientist's doomed attempt to unleash the human mysteries dwelling just beneath the surface of the civilized man. At age 38, Barrymore filmed ""Dr. Jekyll"" during the day at Astoria Studios(Long Island) and performed ""Richard III"" on Broadway at night. Including this one, writer Roy Kinnard lists some 16 different versions, sequels, and spin-offs of ""Dr. Jekyll"" released in the silent era. At least 9 more movie versions surfaced in the sound era, making ""Dr. Jekyll"" the most filmed subject of all time.  Previously released by Kino, and mastered from a 35mm negative, this transfer far surpasses all of the other many VHS and DVD versions. Generous extras include ""The Transformation Scene"", a 1909 audio recording, ""Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pride"", a 1925 short with Stan Laurel, the Sheldon Lewis version released in the same year(1920), ""The Many Faces of Jekyll/Hyde(an essay on the story's history)"", and ""About the Score"" by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. 1920 80 minutes. 1.33:1. Long over-due, this is an absorbing tribute to one of cinema's brightest lights. In fact, nothing would really eclipse a good Barrymore performance until 1929 and the coming of sound. For then we might hear him speak.",1241222400,10,5718,5.126473740621651
8350861,5,B0024OW20Q,"The following is from the press release for this set:

Sherlock Holmes (1922) was mastered from a 35mm restoration by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department, and is accompanied by a score by Ben Model, performed on the Miditzer Virtual Theatre Organ. It is the only new release in this set.

The other three titles are The Beloved Rogue (1927), Tempest (1928) [both previously released by Image Entertainment] and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920) [previously released by Kino].

Only The Beloved Rogue has any extras, which is an introduction by Orson Welles. The Beloved Rogue is not a well-known Barrymore silent, but it shows him in a cross between swashbuckler and comic that is quite entertaining. Plus you get Conrad Veidt, who up to this time had been playing tragic characters in horror films. Formerly released on DVD in 2002, if this is the same transfer it is a good but not great transfer. The Tempest is a film that has John Barrymore as a Russian peasant in search of a military career at the time of WWI/the Russian Revolution. He is caught in a compromising position, and though innocent, is stripped of rank and thrown into prison for the appearance of the thing. Along comes the Russian Revolution and changes everything. Initially released in 2003, this is a pretty good transfer of the film. If Kino restores Sherlock Holmes like they recently restored the Murnau films, that should be some treat to behold.

The Tempest and The Beloved Rogue currently cost as much individually as this set costs on sale/for preorder. Therefore if you are interested in any three of the four, it would probably be worth your while to purchase the set. If you don't own any of the four, you should definitely consider picking this set up and see the versatily of John Barrymore's acting abilities and also that Douglas Fairbanks didn't have a corner on the market of playing the swashbuckler in the silent realm.",1238803200,5,2379,5.512328767123288
