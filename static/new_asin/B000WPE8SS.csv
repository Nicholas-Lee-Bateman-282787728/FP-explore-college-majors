i'm tired of movies where i can predict everything that is going to happen.",1371427200,,115,4.523809523809524
8224791,4,B000WPE8SS,"I liked this one though I thought some of the characters were over the top and acted like no one in the world would actually act, yet alone in the same building with other people also acting like no one else in the world would act.  That said, it was an interesting melange. After a few years of not liking Jennifer Carpenter I had a stint of considering her eh, and then one day i realized i really like her. As in, a lot. So yeah, high marks there. I agree with a previous reviewer that she not only showed the acting chops in this one, but she looked really good in doing so.

  So yeah, this had an interesting plotline, a mix of characters making it happen, and the requisite twists and turns. The ending was cool, and when the credits rolled I was said ""job well done""  aloud, even though no one else was in the room. I liked it, watch it!",1370563200,,845,4.128048780487805

8224793,3,B000WPE8SS,"Here's yet another movie that felt impelled to convey cool by having a host of pointlessly antagonist characters cursing each other at the drop of a hat. Then Judd Nelson as its lead character was presumably meant to lend an additional quality of hip with his hairdo. It's an odd mix of inadvertent morning dishevelment and studied punk - not something a professional psychologist such as he's playing would be likely to sport in public. All it does is introduce a distracting irrelevancy every time Nelson is on screen.

If you can make your way through this thicket though - of bristling lupine hair and bristling tempers - there is actually something worthwhile about this film.

You might think you can see the resolution coming a mile away. But wait. You have to hang in until the very last moments of the last scene, and indeed until the very last sentence of that last scene, in order to get the full impact of what might otherwise be dismissed as a too-common twist. When you hear it, its relative inventiveness reflects back well on the film as a whole and makes ""Grayson Arms"" a place to at least briefly rent after all.",1206144000,,1130,4.616915422885572
8224794,3,B000WPE8SS,"Pros: We get a chance to see early Jennifer Carpenter at work, and it is very interesting to say the least. This movie is worth it for that reason alone. The actual script had potential, as far as the storyline goes, but no budget to speak of I imagine.

Cons: Everything else. Oh, it's Judd Nelson alright, but it ain't vintage...

I whole heartedly recommend this for Jennifer Carpenter, she has some serious chops. She's kinda hot in this movie, too, depending on what character she is playing.

Get it, you have nothing better to do.",1199923200,,537,4.572916666666667
