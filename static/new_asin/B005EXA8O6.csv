8469233,5,B005EXA8O6,"The story of a small band in New York that accepts a gig at a big hotel in Los Angeles. The boss at the new gig is ruthless, and on a personal note kept reminding me of Donald Trump. The romantic interest, ""Toni Blake"" ends up saving the day. This film was made in 1938, and has elements of that Art Deco era in design and music. Directed by Busby Berkeley. Very enjoyable (to me).",1509235200,,381,4.093333333333334

8469235,4,B005EXA8O6,"Slow,methodical pace,but O'Brien is his usual ""paragraph a second"" talker who livens it up somewhat. Payne and Lindsay are OK, but can't keep up with ol' Pat! Movie premise is unique and entertaining. Thanks for quick ship!",1427760000,,223,5.054054054054054

8469237,4,B005EXA8O6,"Excellent little B-movie musical, w3ith an impossibly young John Payne and a fast-talking Pat O'Brien.
Set in a Hollywood nightclub clearly meant to evoke the Cocoanut Grove. I love well-made B pictures and this one was a true surprise",1385337600,,235,5.051282051282051
8469238,5,B005EXA8O6,This is a very good movie of that genre. I got it because Margaret Lindsay is in it. Pat O'Brien is his usual fine-acting self. John Payne is as handsome as ever.,1346630400,,162,4.09375
8469239,2,B005EXA8O6,"This is not a great movie.  ""Garden Of The Moon"" isn't trying to be a great movie.  It does, though, feature two really nifty big band set-pieces, ""The Lady On The 2-cent Stamp"" and ""The Girlfriend Of The Whirling Dervish"".  To me, that's worth the price Amazon is charging.

  BUT, the audio is terribly overmodulated.  That means when Amazon did their on-demand transfer to DVD, whoever did the transfer turned the audio levels up way too high.  The DVD I received sounds awful, like a continual explosion of static.  That spoils this movie, which is all about music.  The original film certainly didn't have this problem.  That means Amazon, or their contractor, screwed up.

  I'll be returning this DVD and requesting a replacement.  We'll see if Amazon can fix this.  I hope so, because the music on this is a foot-stomping good time.  If it's not spoiled by poor audio quality.",1344297600,2,884,4.748344370860927
