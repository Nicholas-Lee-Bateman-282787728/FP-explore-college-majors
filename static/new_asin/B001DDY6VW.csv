It's confusing when Mits talks off camera without any sound and Dexter starts talking as if the viewer knows who he's talking to or what he's talking about.
Watching Jay Cutler's video From Jay to Z, I decided to try a Dexter Jackson video because Jay to Z was a home video. Dexter Jackson's DVD The Blade 2K7/2k is an unedited home video with some local business  advertisements and less interesting than Jay Cutler.
Luckily I bought this used for $17.00.",1305417600,3,662,4.610169491525424
8292895,3,B001DDY6VW,"After getting the Branch Warren, then one of the Ronnie Coleman DVD this DVD was kind of a snooze.  What little Dexter does say is a lot of ""I'm getting old"" my knees hurt, my wrist hurts, I have to eat different because I'm old.  Then a lot of video of him eating, but little dialog just him cooking fish and grits and watching TV or at restaurant eating.  But does get his sponsors plugs in. He should get ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter"" as a sponsor because he drowns all his food in that stuff.  So I found Branch and Ronnie's DVDs more entertaining and informative at the same time.",1265328000,6,589,4.232142857142857
