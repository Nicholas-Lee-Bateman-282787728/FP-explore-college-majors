I find that I enjoy them and they have opened my eyes and my mind  to various subject matter as well as entertain concerning the Indian culture and the people.  The Movie I purchased ""Deewangee"" was far better than I expected. I truly did not know what to expect.  My personal opinion for the bollywood/hindi movies I have seen at the start up it is fun, colorful and always a musical production and then the movies turns in a completely different/unexepected direction.. I  think this is what captures me with Indian movies per se.  I happen to like the actor Ajay Devgan among some others suoper well know actors/actresses.  It is something extra that I see in Ajay Devgan but  when he plays a dark character for me truly shows how well he emerses himself in his craft. I have invested in quite a number of  movies for my personal collection.",1276732800,2,913,4.627329192546584
