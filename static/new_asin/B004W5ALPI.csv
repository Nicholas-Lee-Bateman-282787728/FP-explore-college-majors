8444462,5,B004W5ALPI,"My almost 4yr old loves it and picks up a few phrases! I love the word reviews after each segments, I learn too. A fun intro into Spanish.",1385424000,,138,3.9642857142857144
8444463,5,B004W5ALPI,We keep this in the car so my son can watch it when we drive around.  He loves it!  And he repeats lots of the spanish words.  I am tempted to get another one like this.,1378252800,,169,3.638888888888889
8444464,5,B004W5ALPI,"This is a great DVD! I try to play it daily in the background, just to pick up on things and I find myself sitting and watching every minute. This happens every time. When they go back and forth between English and Spanish it helps me learn the context, pronunciation and when to use the masculine, or feminine version of the word. I also find the humor in the show to be great. I'm sure it's great for kids, I don't have any, it was just for me. Warning: this is not rosetta stone. Its' a funny, clever way to learn Spanish.",1371168000,,525,4.1568627450980395
8444465,1,B004W5ALPI,"I was terribly disappointed with this dvd. After reading the reviews, I couldn't wait for it to get here. However, both my husband (who is spanish speaking) and I felt it was more for entertaining than learning. We have really enjoyed the one DVD we got that is called ""Spanish for Kids: Adentro y Afuera"" I was looking for something a little cheaper, but now realize I'll be sticking with the ""Spanish for Kids"" DVD's.

My kids have watched this dvd twice and haven't said one word in spanish. After watching the ""Spanish for Kids"" dvd once, they had already picked up a couple of spanish words and knew what they meant. Don't waste your money on this; spend $8 more and get the ""Spanish for Kids"" dvd and you won't be disappointed.",1367280000,,733,4.511278195488722
8444466,5,B004W5ALPI,"It's fun, entertaining and both my 5 yr old and 2 yr olds love it.  They actually want to watch.",1363305600,,96,3.8
8444467,5,B004W5ALPI,My daughter and hubby have expanded their vocabulary quite a bit by viewing these cd's. They toggle between English and Spanish with each phrase. They also do a summary at the end just in case you missed something. Nicely done.,1337385600,,227,4.7
8444468,5,B004W5ALPI,"My son is 6 and attends a Spanish immersion school, we have a hard time finding fun kids shows in Spanish, especially ones that introduce words to read.  He loves El Gato y El Perro, it's funny and short, explains enough that I can follow it too, and has words to read in English and Spanish!  We love it!  He is asking for more DVDs so I'm getting more!",1329955200,,354,4.101449275362318
8444469,5,B004W5ALPI,I am an older sister of two siblings that love and adore this show. I find myself being really surprised in how well they are able to use what they learned from the show in real life. I got this gift for my younger brother on his birthday and I know I will be getting more for them both for the Holidays.,1317081600,,304,3.9193548387096775
