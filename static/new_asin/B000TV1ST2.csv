2910785,3,B000TV1ST2,"The humor is way too forced, superficial and well-trodden to add the well-intentioned black comedy elements this otherwise bittersweet soap opera needs, but this 2007 film offers a vanity-free Sally Field giving a powerhouse performance as Anita Bergman, the dying mother of four grown children. The movie's title refers to the amount of time her character is expected to live before succumbing to ovarian cancer. With the clock ticking, the four children gather at her North Carolina home from different parts of the country and respond differently to the imminent tragedy. Directed and written by Steve Stockman as a series of vignettes, the characterizations represent different archetypes, and the actors are left to flesh them out to some human dimension. The results of their efforts are variable.

Affecting an unrecognizable American accent, Ben Chaplin fares the poorest as eldest brother Keith, an LA-based filmmaker whose sarcastic jokes are meant to shield him from feelings of insecurity and guilt. His character has the most screen time, yet his constantly jokey facade gets in the way of any sympathy we have for him. At first, Tom Cavanaugh plays Ben, the son Anita has dubbed the responsible one, as an obnoxious yuppie workaholic who gradually reveals his fears of loss but fades in the background. As only daughter Beth, Julianne Nicholson is terrific in unconditionally embracing her role as chief caretaker given that her mother is really her best friend, for better or worse. Youngest brother Matthew is drawn in the broadest strokes as the picked-upon baby of the family, and his resentment has manifested itself with a shrewish wife whom everybody else hates.

On the sidelines is Anita's second husband of 13 years, Jim, played by James Murtagh, who glowers in resentment as her children take over their house with nary a thought in his direction. Anita's first husband and the father of her children exists as a shadowy figure in the story, and Anita - in one of many revealing videotaped excerpts - has obviously not fully come to terms with her divorce. These clips - showing Anita recorded by Keith in an earlier stage of her cancer - are used as a dramatically effective framing device for the story, and Field shows herself to be at the height of her artistry in these scenes even when the material gets mawkish. Stockman based the story on the death of his own mother in 1997, and this experience informs a lot of the moments in the film, especially the brutalizing scenes of Anita's rapid decline under hospice care.

The 2007 DVD is two-sided split between full and widescreen versions and with the extras divvied up. Stockman provides an informative commentary track accompanied periodically by Dr. Ira Byock, a physician specializing in treating those knowingly facing death. There's also a solid 23-minute making-of featurette, ""Learning to Live Through Dying"", and four scenes labeled deleted though truthfully only one is deleted while the other three are extended. There is a group discussion guide included in each version that provides text questions to help the viewer face the death of a loved one.",1190332800,27,3142,5.061776061776062

or if she really looked that bad in real life.  Yes they had to wrinkle and wither her up a bit, for she looked too good for the character.

2910805,5,B000TV1ST2,"So far I've seen 2 films in which Sally Fields has a terminal illness and dies. Watching her go as Forrest Gump's mother was fairly easy as that sequence only consumed a small part of the movie. But watching her die an inch at a time in Two Weeks is gut wrenching.
Not sure if it was the make-up or Fields' starving herself that gave her such a gaunt look  but the transformation as cancer eats her away is graphic. The transformation of her 4 children who come home at her request for the final 2 weeks of their mother's life at least provides some hope of life springing out of death.",1370304000,,586,4.232142857142857

2910811,2,B000TV1ST2,"While there is nothing terribly wrong with this movie there is, unfortunately, nothing terribly right either. We've all been there before - dysfunctional family gathers at the bedside of a dying (choose 1: grandparent, parent, sibling, child). The actos do well with their roles, but can barely rise above the stereotypes. The poignancy in the film comes from the situation itself, not from any skill in the writing. Each scene follows a predictable inevitability (even the scattering of the ashes at the end), and the humor is forced and unnatural, with two completely superfluous scenes (a son trying to retrieve his bag at the airport; another son trying to get the store discount for orange juice at a grocery) added as intended humorous interludes to break up the sadness of the main story line. There have been many much better films about dying (Wit and One True Thing come to mind immediately), so don't bother with this one unless you're a die-hard Sally Fields fan..",1350086400,,976,4.921212121212121

2910813,5,B000TV1ST2,"I gave a title for my review ""Not for the critics"". Why? Because when watching a movie, everyone is a critic. But the critique is usually about whether a movie is entertaining enough, colorful enough, whether the acting is good enough...and this...is not that kind of film. I am no poet or eloquent speaker. Very simply put, this movie is about death and dying. We start young not thinking about what death will be like for us some day, specially if we are going long before we are ready to, but this is also about those left behind. In this case, grown children. This little movie is listed as comedy and drama, but it's drama with comic relief. One reviewer said that the comedy was forced, but what the reviewer didn't take into consideration is that, in real life this is exactly how it would happen. Most people aren't comfortable with death and most of us, when losing a loved one, have a difficult time coming to terms. I love the instruction about the stages of death, it's a very thoughtful way of educating those specially in hospice. This movie is tactful, and other times thoughtless in the characters interactions with each other, but again, it's what makes it so realistic.
I am a fan of quirky romantic comedies. But more often than not can recognize a gem. A movie with a, what some might call sappy story line, that has the ability to create growth in a person. In this case, me. Sally Field, can play any role and do it well. But I'll tell you, I didn't judge acting, who was in it, or whether the cinematography was good enough. I watched it as if watching friends going through the stages of death. It made me tear up in a few places where I could see myself both as the mother and the grown children. No matter how complex this family was, the end result was human and the message loud and clear, everyone deals with death differently. This movie is very well worth watching and I'll even go as far as calling it beautiful, which seems an odd description about a woman dying of cancer. Diseases aren't pretty, life is messy, death is hard. This movie, tackled all of it with dignity and grace. Everyone needs to see it just once. For me, I think I might see it again. It's one of those films that you don't get all the messages the first time around. There is still more to learn. And that is life is about.",1342569600,3,2328,4.403712296983759
2910814,5,B000TV1ST2,"I absolutely loved this movie.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me wish I'd seen it before my mother passed away.  Adults with an elderly and/or ill parent should watch this movie.  I had never heard of it before seeing it on Amazon.com, but after watching it, I could see the parallels in some of what my siblings and I went through before and after my mother died.  It is a sad, but inevitable theme, portrayed with levity and truth.  This will definitely remain in my DVD library.",1339977600,,493,4.315217391304348
2910815,5,B000TV1ST2,I am a nurse who works with oncology patients.  This movie depicts the highs and lows of fighting cancer.  The cast is awesome.  This movie shouldn't be such a secret.  I wouldn't have known about it without a netflix recommendation.  You will cry until you laugh and laugh until you cry.

2910816,5,B000TV1ST2,"This down to earth portrayal of a family faced with the final days of a loved ones life is wonderful.  It has so many elements.  It has family conflict, compassion, realistic problem solving, humor, sadness, and closure.  It gives great light to Hospice, the end of life philosophy, that help this family through it's final journey with it's loved one.  This is a great story for families dealing with loss, for caregivers, and those preparing for a career in healthcare.  I show it to my nursing class each semester and after the laughter, and the tears the students all agree it's a great video to have watched",1303603200,3,612,4.682242990654205
2910817,5,B000TV1ST2,Best movie ever.  Sallie Feild gave an Oscar perfomance.  People should have a copy so they can learn what to except when their loved one is dying.,1299456000,2,147,4.407407407407407
2910818,3,B000TV1ST2,Sally Fields was really good in this film.  It was very true to my experience with cancer deaths and families.  Still might be hard to watch for some whose experience is recent.,1276300800,,177,4.5
2910819,5,B000TV1ST2,"Being a big fan of Sally Field's TV series ""Brothers & Sisters"", I saw this film at Wal-Mart and picked it up for $3. It seemed to sound similar to the series in that it has four siblings return home when their mother is dying. After watching the movie I was correct in a few ways: the movie possesses the same witty humor as the series, but the drama is a lot more powerful.

Sally Fields shows how amazing of an actress she is by portraying a very frail and weak woman, yet still can command the screen like no other. She plays a strong woman here as she does in the series.

Don't get me wrong, if you don't like the series...you'll still probably love the film. This film also stars some people who were unknowns during production. Those include Julianne Nicholson who has recently finished a 3 year stint on ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" as well as Glenn Howerton, who stars in the hilarious ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"".

This film should not be missed. It did have it's quirks, and parts you wanted to scream at the characters, but every great movie makes you react. And this film certainly does.",1272585600,,1111,4.436274509803922
2910820,5,B000TV1ST2,"This film is a wonder. It deliciously captures the day-to-day realities of hospice, the complexities of different responses to death and dying, and the surprising humor that arises out of tragedy. I laughed and cried all through this film, remembering how things have been in the final weeks and days in the lives of my loved ones. Drama, pain, exhaustion, grief and family history combine in strange ways to prompt unexpectedly heart-breaking and hilarious moments. It's real life. In fact, this film is based on the director's mother's death from cancer some years before.

I highly recommend this film for hospice training and for families facing end-of-life issues.",1266278400,2,669,5.194444444444445
2910821,1,B000TV1ST2,"Not even five minutes into the film and I was completely turned off! The opening conversations are uneducated trash-talk. Scenes with Sally Field showed faint glimmers of her wonderful acting prowess. Even if it were free, I would NOT recommend this flick; it is a total waste of time!",1247788800,,285,4.836734693877551

2910823,5,B000TV1ST2,"This is a wonderful film with great acting.  It truly captures the essence of grief.  Each person handles their grief differently.  There is no correct way to deal with it or in some cases, not deal with it.

This movie is a must for someone who has lost or who is near to losing a loved one.  Sally Fields does a remarkable job of revealing the mixed emotions for a person dealing with death in a healthy manner.  Her children, all of which handle the situation according to their personal quirks, issues and reality, also portray the varied methods of handling one's grief.

I highly recommend.",1231200000,2,596,4.566037735849057
2910824,1,B000TV1ST2,"Sorry, but this film was a total waste of 2 hours of my life. There wasn't one character who was remotely likeable. Every one of the kids were completely unsympathetic. Sally Field's character was o.k. until her big line that each of her kids are amazing. Huh? All of them were self absorbed boors, with the possible exception of the daughter. She was just a boor - not self obsessed. She goes ahead and brings in a rabbi to speak to her mother, even though she wasn't a religious person. This is a fairly typical response when dealing with the imminent death of a loved one. Of course, as in many Hollywood productions, the rabbi or the priest or the minister, turns out to be the biggest idiot imagineable. I guess these guys have no experience in dealing with the dying or the grieving. What a piece of garbage this film was from begining to end. I can't believe it got so many 5 star ratings!",1226880000,2,896,4.403614457831325
2910825,5,B000TV1ST2,This was a great movie that I related to on a personal level. My sister-In-Law had cancer and my two nieces basically lived through the same experiences and emotions as the characters of this movie.,1225497600,2,198,4.685714285714286
2910826,5,B000TV1ST2,"My Mom passed away - unfortunately not at home but in a hospital - over a period of longer than a week. Not unike this movie, her passing was gut-wrenching, at times excrutiatingly sad and comedic. The comedy was sheer tension release, as there is nothing objectively funny about the process of dying and finality of death.

All of my siblings, four rather than three as in Two Weeks, were in attendance for the duration, and as in the movie, Mom's release finally came by way of morphin's mercy, after an ordeal which was greater than Mom, or any living, sentient creature should have to endure. I hope that she has forgiven us our conservatism in this regard.

No person's or family's experience of dying and death is the same and there is nothing universal about it except it happens and you are here one day and not the next. But if there was love, there is almost assuredly also grief, and an enduring sense of loss. For my family, this movie really did mirror a lot of what we experienced and viewing it truly was a cathartic experience. We laughed and weeped as we recognized some of the same horrendous and tender moments shared bedside with our Mom and each other at her death. The performances in this movie are also outstanding. It is so important to show your family members the love that you have for them; in the end, nothing  matters more than family.",1217721600,2,1366,4.522267206477733

2910828,5,B000TV1ST2,"I was very touched by this film. I was so taken with the superb acting, the appropriate choice of actors for each part, that it was only on second viewing that I caught that one actor has a tint of a British accent. His ability to mutter 'mom' in such a heartwarming way overpowered any hint of an accent. I am buying this film so that someday my own four children may see it and appreciate the fact that, despite my flaws as a mother, I did my best and loved them with all my heart, as did the character in the film, played by Sally Field.  want my own children to hear her character's words of wisdom, interspersed with the humor necessary to survive life's experiences. Anyone who does not appreciate this film, has not been a mother and has not experienced what it is like to have a mother become ill. The person who can not appreciate this film has yet to discover life's pitfalls. This film accurately portrays the multiplicity of emotions that occur: the sadness, the horror at the reality of illness, the inevitable need for humor, the warmth that nevertheless surfaces in a family crisis, and the frustration of meshing the invariable differences in personality. I think this is one film that should be viewed by all.",1211414400,4,1226,4.5225225225225225
2910829,4,B000TV1ST2,"""In the deathbed drama ""Two Weeks,"" Sally Field creates an agonizing portrait of Anita Bergman, a middle-aged American every woman in the final stages of ovarian cancer. As her four children and their families descend on the home in North Carolina that she shares with her second husband, Jim (James Murtaugh), the movie squarely confronts the physical realities of dying."" Stephen Holden

Dr Ira Byock, Director of Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center's Palliative Care Service, is a physician I have worked with many times with my patient population. In his book The Four Things That Matter Most'  the four simple phrases that matter the most  -- """"Please forgive me,"""" ""I forgive you,"""" """"Thank you,"""" and """"I love you"""" -- carry enormous power. In many ways, they contain the most powerful words in our language. Help us to forgive, appreciate, love, and celebrate one another more fully. These words are the essence of this film 'Two Weeks"". Sally Field is extraordinary in this film as the mother who is dying of ovarian cancer. Her four children all come home to stand vigil. None of them really know what they are in for.  Ben Chaplin plays the older son from California. A recovering alcoholic, drug addict, we are not privy to much inside info, he is into Zen and withholding his emotions.  Sister, Julianne Nicholson, leads the troops with knowledge from books and the love she has for her mother. Tim Cavanaugh plays the middle child, the most reliable and the least ready to face the death of his mother. The youngest child, Glenn Howerton, is he ever really there, has the most obnoxious wife. Here they are watching their mom, vomit daily and vomiting stool, cleaning the body and cleaning the bed. After a while the daily ritual becomes a routine manner.  Mom, Sally Fields has taped her last words. Some are trite and some are true, are they necessary?  Mom seems to be prepared and the best that she has is her family and a Hospice Nurse, who knows exactly what to do.  Pain medication, care and love and advice are what the Hospice group to best.  They are necessary and wouldn't it be swell if every dying person had the benefit of Hospice.

The writer/director, Steve Stockman, has written a film after his own experience. His mother died several years ago and his experiences are explored fully. Fully developed characters are what is missing from this film . We know they are the children but not who and what they are. Little snippets come through at times, but who are these people we are to care about.

This is a lovely film about dying, but we need to know more. I want to care about these people, I did care about Mom. She was heroic and loving and just the mom you want and want to be.  I love you, mom.

2910830,5,B000TV1ST2,"I rented this moving, after much debate. I lost both my Mother and Father(within two months of each other) both to cancer. This movie helped...it was real, the people in the movie showed what it is like closer to almost any other movie. The humor is apart of that, so is the bitterness, sadness, and pain. It was all there. It was there when you have to watch your parent slowly go away, it is there dealing with old crap with your siblings, it is there dealing with hospice, the white van, the box, and the things that you take for granted daily.
This movie showed us what it is really like, it may be messy at points, it may be sad, difficult to watch at points, but it is true to life.",1204848000,6,688,4.180451127819549
2910831,4,B000TV1ST2,"I watched this movie the night before last and have been mulling it over ever since. It certainly presented a frank and realistic picture of death and dying. Sally Field, as Anita, was outstanding in the main role...not mawkish or self-pitying, but both angry and resigned by turns as she moves thru the final days of her life.

The movie portrays her four adult children whose conflicts do not disappear despite their mother's imminent demise. In fact, their differences probably become more apparent. Accusations fly, old battles are fought, they get angry at others for what they are doing or not doing. This brought back so many memories of my mother's final weeks, when one of my siblings did absolutely nothing to help.

The grown daughter, Emily, faces her fears with volumes of self-help books while some of her brothers bury their heads in the sand. This was also typical of my family (I was the one reading the books, BTW).

I would only hope that every patient could have the kind of gentle hospice care in her home that Anita had in this movie.

Worth viewing, IMO. Good performances all around.",1202256000,4,1107,4.75
2910832,2,B000TV1ST2,"I wanted to provide the names of the songs on the soundtrack because they might be of interest to other viewers.  There is no soundtrack for purchase at this time as far as I can see.  The songs included are:
Guster - Fa Fa, You're Lovely to Me - Lucky Jim, Somewhere Only We Know - Keane, See The World - Gomez, Each Coming Night - Iron & Wine.
I didn't really like the movie very much, but it may have been the genre that grated on me rather than the actual performances of the actors.  The 20/30 something children in this movie other than the daughter Emily seemed relatively self-centered.  It was sad to think that their mother was leaving at a point when they really could have benefitted from some life lessons.  And the poor step-dad got left out in the cold! As if he wasn't grieving as well!",1198886400,2,802,4.28476821192053
2910833,2,B000TV1ST2,"Wow, so much for my faith in Sally Fields.  I guess she is back to her Cannonball Run ability to pick stories.  What a dud this is.  I think it was written by a junior high student in detention over the course of one week.  The script is totally ridiculous, petty, lazy, and insulting. The characters have no character, the story has no point, and there's nothing poignant about this movie, supposedly about a serious and profound subject.  Avoid like death!",1192924800,2,458,4.604938271604938
2910834,2,B000TV1ST2,"If writer/producer/director Steve Stockman's ambivalent little dramedy ""Two Weeks"" proves anything, it's that a first-rate actor in a lead role can make the difference between bargain bin pap and a prime rental candidate.

Yes, the driving force behind his flimsy script can be summed effectively in two words: Sally Field. That's right - the same woman censored during last month's Emmy telecast for her criticism of the Iraq war and/or taking the Lord's name in vein while making her acceptance speech. Lest such a controversy cause us to forget the actress behind the two Oscar and three Emmy wins, however, ""Two Weeks"" gives Field more than ample room to display her impeccable range and cut right to the heart of what makes her a talent for the ages.

It's easy to see why Field signed on to play Anita Bergman, a woman seeing her end prematurely in sight due to ovarian cancer. As the film depicts Bergman at many stages of her disease, it presents many acting challenges that Field sails through with flying colors. From the perspective of her children, however, the story falters.

Keith (Ben Chaplin, sans the British accent), is a tightly-wound filmmaker who covers up his surge of emotions through a straight-faced, dutiful attitude peppered with quasi-witty banter and purported ""Zen""-like ideals. He is not unlike his workaholic brother Barry (Thomas Cavanaugh), who can barely be whisked away from his palm pilot long enough to bid his mother goodbye. Emily (Julianne Nicholson), meanwhile, plays the more sensible, emotionally forthright of the siblings with an armload of self-help books in tow, while Matthew (Glenn Howerton) is between a rock and a hard place as his wife Katrina (Clea Duvall) has issues with his family and vice/versa.

What bogs down the film is that Emily and Matthew are the only two siblings for whom any real sympathy can be mustered, and even the two of them fail to sustain any lasting viewer intrigue. Sure, Field may cast an imposing shadow, but Stockman really fumbles the ball in his character construction of the foursome, leaving the talented actors little to work with. He deserves credit for never taking the easy way out - not even a smidgen of trumped up pathos is to be found here - but the dialogue between the siblings too often smacks of effort, especially early on. Charismatic deadpan comes left and right, but the jokes can be seen from a mile away and feel consistently forced and, most importantly, jarring considering their context. Scenes intended to be comical that occur in an airport and supermarket also yield a sour aftertaste.

There are some fine moments, however. Actor James Murtaugh radiates a poignant blend of strength and vulnerability through his character of Jim Cranston, the siblings' forsaken stepfather, when he finally demands the effects of his wife's demise on him be acknowledged as well. Furthermore, actress Jenny O'Hara, best known for playing Doug Heffernan's bumbling mother on the CBS sitcom ""The King of Queens,"" will surprise many in her heartbreaking scene as Anita's lifelong friend Julia when she cannot bring herself to say goodbye.

Stockman does succeed in driving home the point that bidding a loved one farewell is a gradual process with many layers and quirks. Because of this, ""Two Weeks"" has obvious therapeutic qualities. Still, there is no denying that despite the talents of his actors he should have given his script a re-write with more attention devoted to feasible characterization and substantial humor.",1192924800,5,3517,5.044750430292599
2910835,4,B000TV1ST2,"TWO WEEKS may put a lot of viewers off as it deals confrontationally with the issues of death and dying and yet finds the very human humor that always serves as a relief sidebar in stories (and life incidents) such as this.  Steve Stockman wrote, directed and produced this little film and his inspiration and efforts are well served by a fine ensemble cast. It is a story about dying and the effects the finality of that event have on a family that has dispersed in different directions life.

Anita Bergman (a phenomenally effective Sally Field) is under hospice care as she faces her last days of dying from gastrointestinal cancer.  Knowing that she has little time left she calls upon her four children to return home to North Carolina for goodbyes. Her children are a mixed lot: Keith (Ben Chaplin) is a Zen-influenced California man who has decided to video his mother for posterity; Barry (Thomas Cavanagh) is a workaholic who attempts to piece together time for this inconvenient disruption in his work routine; Matthew (Glenn Howerton) is the baby of the family dominated by a tactless wife whom the rest of the family detest; Emily (a luminous Julianne Nicholson) is the sole sister who has collected all the books on the dying process for her brothers' education and is the stalwart one who holds the family together.  Anita divorced the children's father and remarried a quiet man Jim (James Murtaugh) who is essentially ignored or tolerated by the children.  Anita shares memories, both tender and hilarious, about her life with her family, and as the hospice nurse Carol (Michael Hyatt) tenderly leads the children through  the instructions regarding final care, the four bond again, become more accepting of their disparate directions, share some very funny conversations to relieve the gloom of the event, and interact more than they have since childhood. By the time of the inevitable event come each of the children and their current father have found vulnerabilities and expanded the tokens of love left to them by Anita, now able to carry out Anita's wishes with a modicum of grace and a lot of warmth.

Using the last two weeks of life as a platform for coming together provides the film ample opportunity to address many issues - marriage, children, family, religion, and individuality.  The film is balanced by the superb performance of Sally Field on the one end and the wholly realized characterization by Julianne Nicholson on the other end.  In many ways it is the continuity between the lives of these two women that make the story memorable.  There are some fine lessons to be heard in this film, and the telling of the story is very satisfying to watch.  Grady Harp, September 07",1190419200,14,2710,4.856832971800434

I drove down to the local post office to return the first one and then to the UPS store to return the second one. It was a very disappointing experience.
