8132748,2,B000GISVRK,the cd is a collection of  Berry's hits from many albums and not from the 1986 documentary that was great sound...these are not enhanced and are more equivalent to the original 45 rpm... Poor sound quality cd and none of the powerful versions from the '86 documentary.,1396915200,,268,4.702127659574468

8132751,5,B000GISVRK,"I was nervous about buying the single DVD with the audio CD version of this set but no worries here - in fact I bought another to give as a gift! The interaction between Chuck and Keith Richards alone is worth any purchase price!

The single DVD is the exact same as the old VHS version but with 5.1 audio and remastered video quality! I'll no doubt buy the multi-disc versions latter, but I have been waiting for YEARS for this to be released on DVD! I give this release 5 stars and you even get a bonus 14 track CD for the car!",1165104000,8,529,4.086538461538462
