7814515,5,6301762185,"I have used ""Touring Mexico"" in my Spanish class for years as an introduction to Mexican culture, history and geography. It is a quick-paced movie that does not dwell on one particular theme for any great time, but does not leave you feeling like you are being shorted, either.

The only weakness to the movie is the music and video is a bit dated - some shots from the early '80s anda reference to discotheques come to mind - if someone snorts about that in class I remind them that a ""dance club"" is just a re-named disco!

The movie lasts about an hour and I primarily use it on days when I'm out of class for the day. I made a little worksheet to go with it and it becomes an easy day for the substitute teacher.",1221955200,,716,4.181159420289855
