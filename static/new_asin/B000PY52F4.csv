This spectacular documentary contains many concepts, artifacts, images, heiroglyphs, and teachings about other dimensions from antiquity. The photography of outer space and the ancient ruins is wonderful. Starwalkers and the Dimensions of the Blessed is a generous three hour program. Disc 1 addresses the dimensions, and the stairways to eternal life. On disc 2 of the presentation, titled The Secret Power of the Awakened Heart, several Buddhist principals are discussed, the 4 ways of expressing Love, the 8-fold Buddhist Path, and esoterica.  This took place at the ""Signs of Destiny Conference"" on Nov. 11, 2006. Enjoy.",1251676800,4,690,5.509433962264151
