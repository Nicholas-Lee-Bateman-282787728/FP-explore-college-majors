12459,5,0767821408,"Anyone who will see the soon to be released ""Rushmore"" must see this film first.  The same writers (Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson) and director (Anderson) are behind both products.  Bottle Rocket has mastered  the art of subtle humor and, if you are the right type of person, will  leave you laughing uncontrollably.  I have been recommending this movie to  my friends for almost two years and if you see it you very well may  consider Owen Wilson, who stars as Dignan, one of the funniest and most  talented actors woking today, like I do.  Lines such as ""and I  realized that not only did I not want to answer that question but I never  wanted to answer another watersports question or see any of the people  againg for the rest of my life,"" are classics that when contemplated  within the context of the film are truly special not to mention hilarious.  And classic lines are abundant throughout.  A true must see that may be the  favorite of my favorite movies.",916444800,,964,4.549707602339181
12460,5,0767821408,"I rented this film and hated it the first time I saw it. I rented it a week later and it has become one of my all time favorite movies. The characters are engaging and hillariously eccentric. The dialogue is well  crafted and extremely funny. The plot is enticing and the acting is superb.  Owen Wilson shines as the very odd Dignunt and his brother Luke does a fine  job with Anthony, the lead character. James Caan is good for many laughs  and the director Wes Anderson has made a first effort which he should be  proud of. Bravo!",913420800,,532,4.333333333333333
12461,5,0767821408,"After viewing this film, I became completely intoxicated by the personalities portrayed in this film. My girlfriend became restless after weeks and weeks of my constant quoting of the film. Finally, I laid it down  for her. Either you accept me and my addiction to Bottle  Rocket...or...there's the door. She finally gave me her consent. You must  watch this film. It will change your life.",912384000,,390,4.969230769230769

12483,2,0767821408,"Bottle Rocket is a 1996 film starring a young Owen Wilson alongside his brother Luke Wilson.  It's possibly worth checking out for that fact alone, Owen especially looks different to his later self in movies, you've likely have seen.  The film was written by Owen along with Wes Anderson.  There isn't really much of a storyline though, basically the two brothers play best (or only) friends, Luke's character has been in a mental hospital, but he's clearly the more level headed of the two.  Owen's character wants to impress his former boss (James Caan, who he doesn't mention at first employed him as a landscaper), by robbing a from what I could tell public library.  There's no ingenious plan or anything, it just happens at one point in the film, and it's not that exciting.  Their getaway driver a rich kid, is constantly being bullied and beat up by his older brother.  They decide to lay low at a cheap isolated motor inn where their driver leaves to deal with his brother's demands.  So hence they are stuck there.  Luke's character becomes infatuated with a housekeeping woman who doesn't speak English, the only language he does while Owen's just sets off fire works and mopes around the place.  There's plenty of opportunities for humour with all the above scenarios but for some reason they didn't go there. In fact there really aren't any laughs in the film at all, the characters all act oddly the whole film but that's it, and that just makes the movie seem unrealistic.

If you're a huge Wes Anderson, or of either of the Owen brothers you might want to check Bottle Rocket out just so you can say you've seen everything they've been in/written, but if you're not, you're probably only going to be disappointed.  This is a pretty slow, boring and pointless film.  Could even have been something they were making for a university class or something.",1484092800,,1866,4.722222222222222
12484,4,0767821408,"I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan. It was cool to see his first movie. You can definitely see the beginnings of his style. It's a little slow and not quite as polished as his other movies, but it was pretty good.",1472601600,,206,4.048780487804878

12530,1,0767821408,"I rarely feel like walking out of a movie, but I did with this.  I was watching the DVD and thought about stopping it but instead just let it play while I went about other business.

This movie has no point to it.  it is weird oddball humor for no other reason or purpose other than weird oddball humor.  And I use the term ""humor"" very loosely.

It's obviously not supposed to be a real-life story; it's too strange.  It can't be a satire; there's no parallel to anything in real life.  It's not much of a comedy; the story is weird without being funny.  So what is it?  Nothing.  It's just a bunch of strange characters doing strange things for strange reasons, that has no emotional heft.  You don't care about the characters because they are all caricatures.  You don't feel any emotion because the plot is just absurd.  You don't laugh at any ""jokes"" because they aren't jokes, they're just people acting oddly.  There is nothing to enjoy in this movie.  It seems to be an exercise in deliberately being as weird as possible just for the sake of being weird.  But I see no purpose or artistic point to it.  Maybe we're supposed to be challenged in our assumptions of narrative, coherent story, interesting characters?  For what?  The whole thing is pointless and a waste of time.

I felt the same way about The Royal Tenenbaums.  But I want to be fair and say I did like Rushmore, which was odd but had more of a believable plot and characters.  I am sure nothing and nobody like that exists in real life, but at least it was within the realm of realism.  At least enough within it to prevent me from rolling my eyes at the absurdity of it.",1443484800,,1645,4.374172185430464

Bob, the only one with a car, bails out after his brother is busted as a dealer with Bob's pot growing in the backyard.

13137,4,0767821408,"Wes Anderson is an acquired taste.  His aesthetic is very uniquely tuned into who he is as an artist that if you aren't dialed into his brand of humor his films will be lost on you entirely.  I have to admit, I am not a fan of all of his work, but when he hits a home run it is a real, tried and true masterpiece, and I must say that I have found his latest two offerings to be undeniable cinematic treasures.

In my attempt to fully familiarize myself with this man's work, I dug back a few years to see where it all started.  In 1996 he teamed up with Owen Wilson to flesh out a short film they had released two years prior.  Thus, the careers of both these men were born.  Wilson went on to gigantic fame, thanks to his chemistry with the camera and his knack for playing the lovable loser, but his collaborations with Anderson show a depth to his talent that other directors have yet to tap into.  `Bottle Rocket' is a blast of a film that shows all of Anderson's promise and potential, and while it is certainly rough around the edges and lacks the glossy veneer and visual grandeur that he brought to his later films, the gritty indie quality adds a layer of likability to the film.

It's oddly relatable.

The writing is really key here.  Without the surprising character development, this would have been an average film at best, but there is so much between the lines here, in the things that are not said, and the comedic development is even richer than expected.  It's easy to see why Owen is the Wilson with the career, for Luke is rather lackluster but then again, his character is the least interesting.  He's even upstaged by his love interest, and she barely speaks a word of English.

Look for scene stealing supporting performances from Lumi Cavozos and James Caan in this heist film about bumbling idiots that is sure to make you smile.",1370217600,,1855,4.388888888888889
13138,5,0767821408,"I have my DVR set to record Wes Anderson films automatically, so this popped in and I watched it last night with my housemate and we about died laughing. You can see so many Anderson-isms here in his proto-film: Of course, the Owen brothers ... deliciously dry humor ... and framing of the shots that introduce each sequence that are so fresh.

So many scenes here are micro-treasures, and I don't want to describe them to an extent that I spoil the humor, but watch for Anthony's conversation with his little sister, the live-translation of Anthony's ardor for a Paraguayan motel housekeeper by the motel's dishwasher, and the amazingly ridiculous target of their second heist.

This movie is where it all started for these guys and it remains my favorite film that any of them have stared in.  There is a sweetness to this quirky sort-of-coming-of-age film that explores friendship, loyalty, coming into ones own, and love.  It's a guys movie that appeals to women too.  It is an adventure and a treasure.  My favorite love scene ever is in this movie - beginning with Luke Wilson running across town to claim his love.  This movie is highly quotable; one of my favorite lines is from a scene where the three friends are planning their first heist by diagraming everyone's positions, Luke Wilson's character says, ""Okay. There, you see the star is me, right there, and I'll be in there. The X is Anthony. Bob, you're the zero out here in the car.""

The script has some nice lines and some funny quirks, but not much resolve.  Like some other reviewers, I just couldn't get why Anthony kept letting Dignan drag him into such clearly stupid plans.

13161,5,0767821408,"I have purchased and viewed all of Wes Anderson's films in the past month or so and I have got to say that I am thoroughly impressed. Rushmore, probably his most popular and acclaimed film, is an interesting story focusing on one character (very uncharacteristic of Anderson), Max Fischer. The Royal Tenenbaums, in my opinion, is TECHNICALLY his best achievement to date. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited were both solid entries that I thought were great despite a lack of a certain something (still trying to figure it out). Fantastic Mr. Fox was an extremely well done stop-motion film adapting a story from Roald Dahl. My FAVORITE however is his debut film, Bottle Rocket.

I have now seen Bottle Rocket three times (in the past like 2 months) and on the third viewing, I decided to take some notes. What resulted was a 13-page in depth analysis of the themes and threads pumping through the heart of the film. My favorite aspect of Bottle Rocket is the character development. The character, Dignan, I believe is the most completely realized character of any of Wes' films and possibly the most tragic. Loneliness is the most prominent theme in the film, Dignan being the vehicle for the theme. Through my intense note taking, I was able to find some things that some people may not have picked up on.

Observations: After *successfully* breaking Anthony out of a voluntary hospital, Dignan and Anthony take a bus back home. On the bus, as soon as Anthony begins to talk about his emotional disturbances, Dignan switches the subject because he is uncomfortable talking about emotional problems.
""You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and CRAIG."" - Dignan. The fact that Dignan uses a first name probably signifies that Craig is the step-father i.e. daddy issues.
Throughout the film, Dignan tries to cultivate a relationship with his former employee Abe Henry, whom he looks up to as a father figure.
Dignan recruits Anthony and Bob into his ""team"", brother figures. The film depicts Anthony's sibling and Bob's sibling, but never shows or mentions Dignan having siblings. Only child = loneliness.
Dignan is very much a child trapped in the body of a control freak/army commander type guy. He throws tantrums but at the same time has the urge to be in control of every situation at all times. Anthony and Bob, unfortunately for Dignan, have a much different attitude towards their heists, theirs being more laid back and only semi-committed. Wes even shows us this through the characters haircuts. Dignan has a short hair cut and is even at one point mistaken as being in the army because of it. Anthony and Bob both have long hair that further shows their more laid back attitude. While Dignan plans out their heists to the last detail, Anthony is usually drawing while Bob is wrapped up in his brother.
Also a very minute detail I picked up on was the number of the motel room they stayed in. The room number is 212. This possibly suggests that the two '2s' are Anthony (who has Inez) and Bob (who has Futureman) and the lone '1' in the middle is Dignan. Also the adress of the Lawn Wranglers headquarters is 2215. Again, the '2s' are Anthony and Bob, the '5' is the Lawn Wranglers crew, and the lone '1' is again, Dignan.
""He thought he had a team, turns out to be a man alone. Now, that's tough now. Real tough."" - Mr. Henry speaking of Dignan. This totally captures Dignan up to that point in the movie and really foreshadows what happens during the final heist where he is let down by his entire crew and in turn is the only one who is punished for the 'attempted' crime.
The ending is very bittersweet. On one hand, Dignan is in jail but on the other, it seems like he is growing up. He makes belt buckles while in prison and tells Anthony and Bob that they could give them to Mr. Henry (who totally used Dignan to get closer to Bob and ultimately robs his house) and Apple Jack (who was caught at the scene but the charges were dropped because of his medical condition). He also jokes to Bob and Anthony about an escape plan which shows that he has accepted his fate. This is truly a coming of age story.

I could continue to go on about the analysis (and trust me, I COULD), but I want to touch on other areas of the film. First of all, the acting is absolutely spectacular. Owen Wilson's portrayal as Dignan is one of the most 'real' performances I have ever seen. It definitely helps that he co-wrote it with Anderson. Luke Wilson was also great as Anthony. There is one scene that really shows his talent. It is when he and Dignan are stuck on the side of the road after their car breaks down and Dignan refers to Inez as the ""housekeeper"". The look in Luke's eyes after he says that is actually kind of chilling. That takes skill. Robert Musgrave was definitely well suited for Bob and his performance is definitely on par with Owen and Luke but he was just given less material to work with than them. James Caan gives a very unique performance as Abe Henry. It was an odd but effective choice. AND YOU CAN'T FORGET KUMAR! Nothing makes me laugh more than when Dignan walks in on Kumar sitting on a couch while he should be cracking a safe.

Style wise, this is probably Wes Anderson's least ""Wes Anderson"" film. After Bottle Rocket, he really defined his style and stuck with it for the rest of his career. The cinematography by Robert Yeoman is simply superb and he manages to craft some stunningly beautiful shots. The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is indeed effective while the choice of already recorded music by Anderson is great. I found that ""Seven and Seven is"" by Love and ""2000 Man"" by The Rolling Stones define the scenes that they are played in and Anderson continued to burn scenes into our memories through his use of music in the rest of his films.

Making a long story short (too late), Bottle Rocket is in my top 10 films of all time. All the characters are just so rich and fleshed out that I find it irresistible to come back and continue to watch and enjoy there little quirks and mannerisms. I just find it amazing that all of the newcomers (Wes, Owen, Luke, and Bob Musgrave) met each other (obviously Owen and Luke didn't meet up, haha), created this masterwork, and now are all famous and successful (not so much Bob). This film gets my absolute highest recommendation if you have yet to see it. I urge you to watch it multiple times though so you can really catch the genius and depth of the characters. Also, check out Wes Anderson's other movies, especially The Royal Tenenbaums, which also delves deep into it's characters and is considered by many to be a near masterpiece.

On a final note, I also CANNOT WAIT for Moonrise Kingdom to come to my town. When I found out that it was initially only being released in New York and Los Angeles, I almost lost it. I have since cooled down and decided to appreciate the films I already have by him to their fullest before worrying about Moonrise Kingdom.

13162,5,0767821408,"Wes Anderson's ""Bottle Rocket"" is a hilarious nonadventure starring Owen Wilson (Dignan) and Luke Wilson (Anthony Adams).  The spirit of the movie is really it's..lack of spirit. Dignan is a lot like Don Quixote lacking any Sancho Panza: a wannabee criminal with very little going for him, he believes himself to be a leader and unfortunately is, in a way.  A leader of two other guys (Anthony and Bob) who are as desperate and lost as he is.

The three attempt to rob local bookstores, stay in cheap motels with the money they don't really take (more like five dollar bills grabbed nervously here and there) and get the crap beaten out of them when they seriously try a successful caper. (The most successful one is when they semi-rob Anthony's mom's house.  His house.)

So many people complain that the humor isn't obvious in this movie: I'm not sure I understand that.  Everything these guys do is hilarious in one sense or another--especially what they don't do.  Should there be an applause and cackle button in the DVD menu?  To me this is an absolute classic--don't miss the ""bank heist"".",1308096000,2,1096,4.731578947368421

When I first watched ""Bottle Rocket"", I thought it was an excellent (hilarious, surprising, brilliant, inspired) film, but one that obviously lacked the polish needed to propel it to ""Rushmore"" status. I hate to admit it, because it's so superficial and pedestrian, but it's true. Boy, was I wrong.

I think I realized how off base I was after I saw ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". I loved that movie, don't get me wrong. It was like ""Rushmore"" on crack. But I still felt like I'd eaten a whole bag of candy after I watched it.

Now I recognize that ""Rushmore"" and ""Tenenbaums"" (and ""Life Aquatic"", and ""Darjeeling"") suffer from a pedantic deliberateness that Anderson probably just couldn't afford here. I love all of those movies, but ""Bottle Rocket"" is just so much more sincere and immediate.

I sometimes wonder if the film holds the same allure for women as it does for men, just because so much of it revolves around male adolescent preoccupations (being on a ""crew"", firing guns, secret plans, fireworks).

13182,4,0767821408,"""Bottle Rocket (1996), the first feature by Wes Anderson has become a cult favorite, and made the names of Anderson and Wilson's (three brothers, Owen, Luke, and Andrew acted in the picture, and Owen, the self-proclaimed troublemaker co-wrote the script with Anderson) popular, and their fans waiting for more. BR is an offbeat crime/comedy about three friends, Dignan (Owen), Anthony (Luke), and Bob (Robert Musgrave) who tried to pursue the career of the professional criminals. If ever three screw-up characters were less suited for becoming tough guys, thieves or bank robbers, I am yet to see them on the screen. Of all three, Dignan takes the cake - his brazenness, ineptitude, clumsiness and lack of any sense of reality in the combination with the true belief that he was born to become a ""made man"" (or something like that) and that the local ""godfather"" Mr. Henry (James Caan in a very funny cameo) would take him and his friends seriously are absolutely adorable. Andrew Wilson, the oldest of three brothers has a small role as Bob's obnoxious older brother. I personally don't think that ""Bottle Rocket"" is a masterpiece and the best movie of that year but it certainly has got some very funny moments, especially in the beginning (Dignan helps Anthony to run from a mental hospital and soon they pull a job of robbing the local book store; Dignan interviews Bob for a position of a runaway driver) and in the end when three friends are sent by Mr. Henry to the biggest (and the most hilarious) heist that would be the apotheosis of their careers.

Definitely not in-your-face comedy, their impact is much dryer and subtler (I remember the nude gal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-Aquatic-with-Steve-Zissou/dp/B00005JNLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>&nbsp;just being there because some nudity was needed.

I'd never heard of BOTTLE ROCKET until somebody pointed it out to me. Having enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>&nbsp;tremendously, it came highly recommended. And after watching it, I can see why.

This is early Anderson, and a film that helped launch his inimitable movie style. Released in 1996 and starring the newly found Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen), it goes to show that Anderson knew how to pick a good script and good actors to round out a chuckle-fest.

Luke Wilson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Super-Ex-Girlfriend/dp/B000J4QW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a>) is no stranger to Anderson films now, having been given the lead role here and later strong supporting roles in The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, Luke can celebrate his strong Anderson film trifecta and proudly point back to his roots in this film. Brother Owen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cars/dp/B00005JNS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cars</a>) is one up on Luke in that he has performed in all of those, plus The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.

Mental health issues abound for Anthony (Luke Wilson) and his buddy Dignan (Owen). In fact, Anthony has just been released from a voluntary psychiatric facility where he was resting after a nervous breakdown. Waiting for him in the bushes (literally) is Dignan, who believes Anthony is escaping from the psych ward instead via his own free will.

The two quickly go back to their old ways. They decide to return to a life of petty thieving and even do dry-runs by ""robbing"" Anthony's family's home in order to see if they still have their robbing edge. They also decide to take on the strangest heists (from meat packing plants to bookstores). Since neither of them own a car, though, they have to get a driver and they pick Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) simply because ...well ...he has a car. Their first felony occurs at the aforementioned bookstore and they make quick their getaway, leaving town and scurrying across the state. They end up at a motel in the middle of nowheresville and decide to hold up. But the trio quickly turns sour when a pretty young hotel maid name Inez (Lumi Cavazos) catches Anthony's eye. Speaking no English, the Central American goddess fails to realize how messed up yet in love Anthony is with her (partly due to the language barrier and partly do to Anthony's fumbling ways).

Word eventually comes to Bob (the driver) that a family member is in trouble and he has to return to town. Since he has the only car, Anthony and (more importantly) Dignan, flip out, telling him he can't leave. But he does and leaves Anthony and Dignan stranded at the hotel (which is fine with the love-struck Anthony). But Dignan wants to get out of there, so he devises a plan to steal a car and return to their lives of thievery. Not wanting to leave without his newfound love interest, Anthony tries to convince Inez to come with them. A misunderstanding ensues and he and Dignan are back on their debauched road. Eventually they take on a robbery at a meat packing plant and it goes horribly. Risking everything, eventually a choice has to be made about who stays behind -- and takes the risk of capture -- and who goes free.

It is the strange and quirky (there's that word again) that drives this film. Owen Wilson's character (Dignan) is obviously an extreme case of an excessive-compulsive. He plans out items to the nth degree, ensuring that everything is okay decades later. Anthony (Luke) struggles to regain some sense of normalcy in his life but keeps getting dragged back down by his bond with Dignan while being tugged the other direction by Inez.

In the end, all turns out bizarrely well. Dignan ends up where he belongs, Owen gets what he needs, and even Inez finds what she's looking for.

Certainly one of the less known Anderson films, this one still comes highly recommended, just not as highly as his more recent works.",1188086400,,5626,6.202564102564103

13186,5,0767821408,"This film is probably starting to make its way to mainstream with the commercial success of the Wilson brothers, Luke and Owen.
This film is perhaps one of the best independent films I have ever seen.  Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson (who co-wrote with Owen W. and directed the film) paired on several films of less-than-popular stature.  All of them are quirky at worst and extremely entertaining at best.  As a note, I would recommend all of them as spectacular, with slight hesitation on ""The Royal Tannenbaums"".
This film in particular was a showcase of how good writing can make up for subpar acting.  The actors in this movie were not great, but the story, the words, they were fantastic.  Basically, a guy gets bored with life and wants some adventure and he drags his buddies along as he attempts to become a criminal. Things don't go as planned, but the results are very funny.
I am not a huge fan of big hollywood type films, so I have lost interest in most of the films of the Wilson brothers, but this one shows brilliance when they were unknown.
A very intelligent, funny film.  It is not a slapstick comedy, so don't rent it if you are expecting ""Tommy Boy"" or ""Happy Gilmore"". If you like quirky comedies, comedies that make you think, in the vein of ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", ""A Mighty Wind"" or ""Rushmore"", then this is a perfect fit for you; buy it.  If you want a 3 Stooges type comedy, you can look elsewhere; this one is more low key.",1176508800,3,1470,4.503759398496241
13227,4,0767821408,"Even though he's only made four movies, Wes Anderson is one of the most talented, interesting, and quirky directors in the business.  He's still young, but with only four films under his belt he's already become a synonym for a very distinct type of filmmaking, e.g. ""That movie was kind of Wes Andersonish.""  Having seen the final three films of the Anderson canon (RUSHMORE, THE ROYAL TENEBAUMS, and THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU), I finally had the opportunity to see Anderson's debut feature, BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie begins rather slowly, but by the end I was laughing my head off and decided BOTTLE ROCKET was my second favorite film next to THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU.

The movie was released early in 1996 and though not as technically strong as Anderson's later pictures, it illustrates the genius of filmmaking that he is.  In addition to being Anderson's major directorial debut, the movie is also known as the film that catapulted the Wilson brothers, Owen and Luke, into superstardom.  Luke Wilson portrays Anthony Adams, a young man who is struggling with his identity and purpose in life.  After taking time to recuperate at a voluntary mental hospital, Anthony returns home and meets up with his childhood friend, Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Anthony is looking forward to settling down and getting on with life while Dignan has bigger plans for both of them.  Dignan wants Anthony to enjoy life, too, but through a totally different means than he imagines:  a life of pleasure gained from committing crime.  At first, Anthony isn't willing to join Dignan's wild scheme, but Dignan is persistent and breaks through Anthony's reluctance and gets him to join him on a crime spree to impress Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry, a supposed local crime lord.  Dignan also gets another friend, Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) to join the scheme.  While Dignan goes about planning the caper, Bob tries to fend off his bully brother John, aka ""Future Man"" (Andrew Wilson--the overlooked Wilson brother) and Anthony falls in love with a Latino motel housekeeper named Inez (Lumi Cavazos).

The film leads up to the caper itself, an event that is both hilarious and heartbreaking.

All of the actors do a great job.  I particularly liked Andrew Wilson (whose real childhood nickname was Future Man because he was seen as being so serious and looking to the future) and Kumar Pallana who portrays Kumar, a supposed expert safe-cracker that Dignan adds to his crime team.

Not everyone is going to enjoy watching BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie has a very odd pacing, even for a Wes Anderson film.  It's evident that both the director and cast were adjusting to making a major picture.  Also, since this is a Wes Anderson picture, not everyone is going to like, enjoy, or even understand the humor.  There are no cheap gags or easy jokes.  Instead, the comedy can best be described as intellectual-situational.  In short, it's kind-of Wes Andersonish.

I fell in love with this movie right from the get-go.  The directing is so unique and the film's score by Mothersbaugh is simply brilliant.  The characters in this film (like the three other Anderson films) are all so likeable no matter how eccentric and dysfunctional they may be.  Everyone in the cast does a fantastic job, but Owen Wilson (Dignan) steals the show.  His performance in this film, in my opinion, is by far the finest work he has done to date.  It's pure comic genius, and one could easily say that this was a role that he was born to play as cliche as that may sound.  I would also have to say the same about his charming brother Luke as well (although he did an excellent job in the Royal Tennebaums too).  James Caan in a small, supporting role is absolutely hilarious on top of just being Jimmy Caan, one of the coolest cats alive!  He gives the film that extra added kick that it needs half way through when he first appears on screen.

I personally love this film but like I stated earlier, it is definately not for everyone.  The humor is subtle and wry, but it's non-stop throughout the movie - you just need to pay attention!  There are so many classic lines as many of the other reviewers mentioned.  I have shown this movie to many friends of mine, some get it and love it while others look at me as if I'm from another planet.  However, I am a 'strange' dude when it comes to movies.  I usually despise Academy Award winning/nominated films (i.e. Titanic, American Beauty, etc...) or can't figure out why 'American Pie' and 'The Break Up' are considered to be so damn funny.  So then again, what do I know?  I know one thing - this movie is what movies are supposed to be - ENTERTAINING from start to finish.  If I could give it another star I would!

It's basically just a Wes Anderson movie.  Owen Wilson is a wannabe criminal who has plans to get the local mob boss, his former employer, to notice him and his friends by pulling off a heist at a bookstore.  They go on the lam and hide out at a motel before circumstances send them back home.

The funniest lines aren't likely ones you'll notice the first time through.  Talking about tipping the help at the motel, why they wear white tape on their noses when pulling off the bookstore job, Bob Mapplethorpe's description of why he should be in the gang, Dignan explaining why they didn't rob his mom's home...  It's subtle and incredibly funny.

This is a comic treat of a movie, but it's one that most people aren't going to like the first time through, unless you've already familiarized yourself with other Wes Anderson flicks like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.  It's certainly not my favorite movie, but it's really good stuff.

This slowness takes away from the humor aspects of the movie because it drags too long.  Otherwise the humor before this portion is as charming and crass as watching I Heart Huckabees.

Essentially, `Bottle Rocket' is about 3 young men.  1.) Anthony (Luke Wilson) - a somewhat caring, laid back and under-motivated dude.  2.)  His pal Dignan (Owen Wilson) - an extremely motivated - albeit misguided  - and overly energetic guy, who is perhaps a little clueless. And 3.) Bob - a guy who always wears Reservoir Dog-esque suits; Bob seems frequently annoyed by Dignan's antics but puts up with him because he is kind of lonely.

The plot of this movie is really not that important, and I fear that a too thorough description might be misleading.  Yes - the film revolves around the three friends' attempts at small crimes, but this is not a slap-stick comedy about burglaries gone awry (even though they are entirely inept and even though the burglaries are extraordinarily funny).  Rather, this is a very dry comedy that thrives on dialogue (vs. physical humor).  If you've seen writer/director Wes Anderson's other films (such as `Rushmore' and `The Royal Tenenbaums'), you know what I mean.

This movie is one of my all-time favorite comedies (and my favorite of the Anderson films) for two reasons.

1.  The characters are entirely likeable.  They're doofuses, but they are really sweet.  It's impossible not to root for them.  For instance, when they rob a local bookstore, they don't blast into it like a bunch of tough guys.  They are bumbling and apologetic - and yet, as giddy as can be.  I mean - they're really excited to be hanging out with each other and to be pulling off this heist.  It's almost like a bonding experience for them.  And this is the tone throughout the film.  Despite disagreements, they really care for each other.  Their playfulness (and quasi-innocence) is accentuated by the lighthearted soundtrack (which is also excellent).

2.  The delivery in this film could not be more subtle.  Let's contrast the humor in `Bottle Rocket' with the sort of humor exhibited by other contemporary comedians.  Take Will Farrell.  When he delivers a funny line, he's usually half naked, his eyes are bulging out of his head, and he shouts it at the top of his lungs so that everyone can hear him.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Will Farrell.  I mean, I personally don't find him that funny, but I know a lot of people who do.  I just want to use him as a point of contrast.  Now take this scene from `Bottle Rocket' and compare:

Dignan is in a ridiculous yellow jumpsuit on some sort of rundown moped and is talking to Anthony.  Bob's macho and not-so-nice older brother - Future Man - pulls up in a jeep and mocks Dignan's attire.  After Future Man drives away, Dignan is feeling pretty hurt.  Anthony tries to make him feel better and says something to the effect of, ""Come on, man.  Did you see what he was wearing?"" (Future man had on a waspy, pastel colored polo shirt.)  Dignan replies under his breath (I didn't even catch the line the first time I saw this movie) and in all seriousness, ""Yeah.  It was pretty cool...""  This is the sort of comedy I love.  It's not in-your-face.  It's barely on the radar.  If subtle humor likewise appeals to you, then chances are you will love `Bottle Rocket.'  Worth noting, for those of you who have seen `Royal Tenenbaums' and are expecting something more or less identical - `Bottle Rocket' is in the same vein of comedy - but is definitely more subtle and less ""colorful.""  I just want to warn you so that your expectations don't cloud your appreciation of this hilarious film.",1136419200,7,3605,4.64500792393027

13268,4,0767821408,"Low-key, deadpan humor is the name of the game in this quirky comedy that is chock full of Wilson brothers.  Owen wrote and starred in the film alongside brother Luke, and yet another Wilson brother plays a small role as their buddy's brother.  Bottle Rocket is definitely a quirky little film, and its humor won't appeal to everyone.  Inevitably, you'll either enjoy it or wonder why such a nothing story was ever made into a film.  By this point, I have to come to terms with the fact that I am actually an Owen Wilson fan; I can't help it - the man's just extremely funny.

The story centers around Anthony (Luke Wilson), who just got out of a voluntary mental hospital, and his one-of-a-kind buddy Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Dignan has big plans; in fact, he has the next fifty years charted out.  This master plan of his calls for Dignan and Anthony to pull a few burglary jobs and thus impress the local landscaper (I mean, criminal mastermind) Mr. Henry (James Caan) so much that he makes them part of his crew.  Dignan obsessively maps out each facet of his plans, treating them as daring capers of great importance, but Anthony and his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) tend to get distracted rather easily.  The first job, a little after-hours bookstore robbery, sort of succeeds despite itself, and the trio goes on the lamb until the supposed heat is off, holing up in a cheap motel out in the middle of nowhere.  Here's where things start falling apart, at least insofar as Dignan is concerned.  Bob's all worried about his brother having been arrested for the pot that Bob was growing in his own backyard, while Anthony falls in a rather pathetic - but awfully sweet -  kind of love with Inez the housekeeper (Lumi Cavazos) - despite her limited knowledge of English.  Everyone goes his separate way, basically, but the gang comes back together in order to pull their most ambitious (and, of course, wildly unsuccessful) heist yet.  There's not a great deal of story resolution at the end, but that's okay; the film's ambiguity is actually one of its strengths.

Bottle Rocket is a decidedly quirky film, but the characters of Dignan and Anthony really grow on you.  Poor Dignan, despite all of his big plans and enthusiasm, is really just a loser going nowhere, while Anthony basically just wants the world to slow down to his low-key pace and to be reunited with Inez.  The whole film thrives on a fairly intellectual brand of comedy - no toilet humor, outrageous pratfalls, or low-brow, course jokes to generate cheap laughs.  Sure, the movie is sort of stupid, but the comedy certainly isn't.  Basically, you either get Bottle Rocket or you don't.  That's probably one of the reasons that the film has never managed to generate a giant blip on the radar screens of movie viewers - and that's too bad because Bottle Rocket really is a funny little oddball of a film.",1121212800,,2874,4.6646825396825395
13269,3,0767821408,"Anybody reading this has probably already seen the movie, but...

This is a fun little movie based around 3 guys in their mid-twenties who innocently choose to pursue a life of crime out of sheer boredom.

Owen Wilson is brilliant as Dignan...an insecure character with a strong desire to be a criminal mastermind. He recruits his best friend Anthony (Luke Wilson) to be his right hand man and take down some scores together. Bob joins the ""gang"" as the getaway driver, which makes sense since he is the only one with a car.

I would consider this an Owen Wilson movie moreso than a Wes Anderson film because Owen carries this movie in every scene. Any scene without Dignan tends to drag along (the whole Anthony/Ines relationship really slows down the flow).

I give this 4 STARS minus one for the bare bones DVD. No commentary, no deleted scenes, we don't even get to see the original short film version of Bottle Rocket that was shopped around and eventually led to the feature length.

Owen Wilson also makes his debut playing the standout Dignan, a ""mastermind in his own mind"" amongst a trio of wannabe criminals. Words don't do his role justice...Dignan's simple presence practically provokes laughter.

Someone unfamiliar with Wes Anderson's works might want to start with Bottle Rocket first, since it's probably the lightest & most ""accessible"" of his films...be that as it may, the ride is no less rewarding. 4.5 stars.",1116633600,4,812,5.2384615384615385

13272,4,0767821408,"Bottle Rocket is ostensibly about a pair of recently graduated high-schoolers who, through boredom or ill-ambition or the mercy of friendship, choose to initiate their early adulthood with a heist.

The film begins as Anthony, played by Luke Wilson, is checking himself out of a club-med style mental institution where he has spent time for exhaustion--though this despite the fact that he has never actually worked a day in his life. He has, however, to leave the institution through a window so that his best friend Dignan, played by real-life brother Owen Wilson, may think that he has helped him to escape--though this despite the fact that Dignan hasn't actually done anything more than signal his presence with a mirror and wave to the psychiatrist whom he has mistaken for a complicitous janitor. On the bus-ride back home, Dignan shows Anthony his spiral notebook in which he has outlined their life course for the next 75 years. And they are, it seems, already behind schedule. So, to get underway and to provide themselves with a capital base, they plot the robbery of a bookstore. They also enlist the aid of another friend, Bob, played by Robert Musgrave, who will drive the car. The robbery is a success of sorts though their disguises are no disguises and their progress is impeded by the absence of bags that will hold something bigger than a paperback. Dignan is ecstatic over their success and in a fit of good fellowship proposes that Bob be given the ""Spirit Award"" for his part in the crime. They then go on the lam for a while, hiding out in a large motel on an otherwise uninhabited stretch of Texas highway. There, Anthony spies and falls in love with a member of the motel housekeeping staff, Inez, played by Lumi Cavazos. There are a variety of complications that then conspire to divide the crew, after which Anthony and Bob undertake a series of non-criminal activities such as a paper route and coaching a pee-wee soccer team, and Dignan returns to his old job at the Lawn Wranglers, which serves as a front for the larcenous activities of Mr. Henry, played by James Cahn. Anthony and Dignan eventually reconnect and, for the purposes of bolstering Dignan's self-image, Anthony joins Dignan in one last large-scale heist, meant to impress Mr. Henry. The film ends with that heist and the capture of one of its perpetrators in an act of humanity.

The beauty of the film lies not in the complications or originality of the plot--but in the course of the character development. The boys are not really criminals but people pretending to enjoy what they believe are the non-material rewards of crime--a kind of life-informing cool. Which is to say, I suppose, that they are mere teenagers looking for the kind of social selves and knowing attitudes that can only really come from having lived a little longer than 18 or 19 years and at some other business than being a teenager. What's more, they have chosen a career requiring a soulessness and absence of empathy that belies their own thoroughly good-natured polity.

They can't quite get the criminal patter down and have eventually to revert to ""Sir"" and ""please"" and ""I'm sorry"" before they can complete their first robbery. When one of them is later used and betrayed, he doesn't want anyone to think that there are ""any hard feelings."" And when Anthony gives away the last of the money that they have stolen, Dignan can only scream ""That's inappropriate!""--a sentiment and phrasing that are as harsh as it gets while delivered with the most profound sincerity.

If you have the time and the inclination, I recommend that you go to your local video store and rent this sweet tale of a collection of courteous naives whose criminality can't quite free itself from the rules and conventions that govern good humor and civility.",1112745600,4,3806,4.814984709480123

13280,4,0767821408,"Released in 1996, this is Wes Anderson's first feature movie and the beginning of a great career that has also included the fantastic quirky comedy-dramas ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" ""Bottle Rocket"" isn't the equal of those films, but it is a great start to Anderson's career, and a fine little comedy. It also marked the beginning of the stardom of Owen Wilson, who co-wrote the script with Anderson and plays the most noticeable and memorable part. The film was shot in Texas, Anderson and Wilson's home state, based on a short film they had made two years earlier.
The movie has the type of laid-back and character-driven humor that won't appeal to everyone. This is comedy that doesn't target laughs or build up elaborate set-ups as most comedies do. Instead, the humor is continuously slow-pitched to you in the form of weird but likeable characters, off-center attitudes, and situations that seem familiar to us but are played in unreal ways and thus become extremely funny. All together, it's an extraordinarily enjoyable and pleasant movie that strolls through its story with no particular rush.
Owen's brother Luke Wilson, who had so far appeared in every Wes Anderson film, plays Anthony Adams, who gets out of a voluntary mental hospital after recuperating from a breakdown. His friend Dignan (Owen Wilson) has big plans for both of them -- a life of easy and enjoyable crime! Dignan doesn't have any good ideas, but tries to make up for it with endless enthusiasm and an outrageously optimistic view of life. Unfortunately, when things inevitably don't go well for him and his friends start criticizing him, he can fall into pretty bitter depressions. Owen Wilson has the character nailed down, and Dignan sets the tone for most of Wilson's other characters: the enthusiastic but misguided nut. Dignan gets his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) in on his plan to pull a 'job' (and all of Dignan's 'jobs' are minor-league suburban affairs) that will attract the attention of the local crime boss/landscaper, Mr. Henry (James Caan in a brief but darned funny performance). Dignan get obsessed with his planning and attempts at damage control, while Anthony and Bob are more busy with the really important things in their lives: Anthony falls for a housekeeper at a motel (Lumi Cavazos, from ""Like Water for Chocolate""), and Bob tries to deal with his bully of a brother, Future Man (Andrew Wilson -- yep, another Wilson).
The film has some sad and serious moments -- after all, these are characters who are really going NOWHERE in a very boring suburban landscape -- but with Dignan around it never stays down for long. There are plenty of chuckles and some real moments of howling laughter, especially during the climatic 'take down' (and I'm really using that term pretty loosely). Another Wes Anderson favorite actor, Kumar Pallana, who appeared as Pagoda in ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" is on-hand to add comedy as a safe-cracker (and again, I'm really using that term loosely).
If you like quirky, odd, but realistic comedy, and if you've enjoyed Owen Wilson in many of his later performances, ""Bottle Rocket"" is really worth a look.

13282,5,0767821408,"Taking a trip into Wes Anderson's head is like going into a parallel universe where most things are the same, but the nature of reality is just slightly warped. And that formula holds true for ""Bottle Rocket,"" his first collaboration with actor Owen Wilson (who also stars), an absurdist crime caper.
Anthony (Luke Wilson) has just been released from a mental hospital after being treated for exhaustion (""You haven't worked a day in your life. How could you be exhausted?""). He hangs out with his idealistically weird pal Dignan (Owen Wilson), who has mapped out his life over the next 75 years. Dignan, having seen a TV special, has decided to become a master criminal.
First they recruitt the timid Bob (Bob Musgrave) as the getaway driver, as he is the only one who has a car. They practice for a while on smaller-time burglaries, such as robbing a bookstore -- then hiding out at a motel, where Anthony falls in love with the pretty South-American maid (Lumi Cavazos). However, the guys find themselves in hot water when they bump into a REAL crime boss (James Caan).
Wes Anderson's touch is a little rough in his movie debut, but it's that slightly unpolished touch that makes his offbeat style a delight here. For example, Anthony ""escapes"" from a hospital that he can leave anytime he wants. That unnecessarily complex opener sets the tone of the rest of the movie, of thrillseeking young men who are just a little out of sync with the rest of us.
Don't expect stupid puns, toilet humor and bad sex jokes. ""Bottle Rocket"" shares the dry, funny, erratic humor of Anderson's later movies. Not to mention a thousand funny little lines (""Bob stole his car!""). Anderson and Wilson avoid being self-consciously cool, in favor of being earnestly quirky. No banter, just wit.
The Wilson brothers are in fine form here, especially when interacting with one another. Anthony is calmer and thinks a lot; Dignan is idealistic and wacky almost to the point of mental illness. They have a certain innocence despite their illegal ambitions, and it's fun just to see them ramble around. They, Inez and Bob are sort of misfits, but not the kind you laugh at.
It's a little erratic, but ""Bottle Rocket"" comes across as fresh, weird, and extremely well-done. Funny, zany and charming crime comedy with a twist of Wes Anderson.",1080691200,31,2315,4.79
13283,5,0767821408,"I might as well not even try to give BOTTLE ROCKET a fair and balanced review because Owen Wilson is all I can talk about when it comes to this movie. His character, Dignan, is the embodiment of what movie characters should be: entities that live beyond the movie, beyond time, and beyond the actor who plays them. Dignan is quite possibly the best movie creation I have seen in a LONG time. I have a newfound respect for Owen Wilson's acting and his screenwriting ability.

With my short homage to Dignan being over (for now...), I will say that BOTTLE ROCKET does not fail to live up to Wes Anderson's usual offbeat comedies. Having seen RUSHMORE and THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS before this movie, I was well prepared for the characters in BOTTLE ROCKET to be slightly insane, off-beat and freakishly realistic at the same time. There seems to be a common vein that runs through all of Anderson's lead characters--an insatiable drive towards something that the audience (and other characters) may not be able to grasp until the end. You know going into a Wes Anderson film that you are going to be treated with a rare glimpse of an indiscernible time period where the constraints of reality/normalcy do not exist.

I must agree with many of the other reviewers here in that this movie is definitely not for people who can ONLY find humor in the obvious slapstick/punch-line formula. I think all of Anderson's movies are in the ""love `em or hate `em"" category for this reason. The humor in this movie is understated, of course, and it lives within the idiosyncrasies of the characters. The way certain characters deliver their dialogue with their own unique brand of subtle comedy makes this movie what it is: a completely quotable riot for those ""in the know"" to relish on.

And now I'm back to Dignan. His sincerity and enthusiasm will overwhelm you. In one scene all he does is make a semi honk its horn with the usual yanking motion out a car window, but the gleam in his eyes and smile on his face when he says ""Did you hear that?"" evokes a pure, childlike excitement that lights up the screen. Dignan definitely sees through the eyes of a child-the world is in black and white to him...maybe only one color, actually. The only things that matter to him are his best bud, Anthony (Luke Wilson as the compassionate realist he plays well) and his ""75-Year Plan.""

Okay, I must finish here because I could go on for a while...nobody wants that. Just watch this movie. ""I'm calling my gang! KA-CAW! KA-CAW!""",1078963200,2,2502,4.628378378378378

The twist may have been predictable if you are looking for one, but viewing the film with the abandon with which indie films are usually created allows for more enjoyment of the film. The development of the characters in the way they are similar and at the same time uniquely different adds to the appeal of the film. Not a profound or moving film in the life-questioning, verging on depressing nature of many of my favorite indie films, but pleasantly uplifting in the way the characters portray a dedicated belief in their ideals, no matter the level of their seeming importance to others.",1078012800,,830,4.577181208053691

13298,4,0767821408,"The combination of Wes Andersen and Owen Wilson has proved to be a formula for success.  Artistic success of a unique sort, these two have provided us with a taste of what modern filmmaking can do.  Colorful, imaginative, and funny, Bottle Rocket is the first in a series that brought us the splendid Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums.
The movie plays a bit like an inside joke, though it is a joke that welcomes you in.  If you let yourself into the circle you'll find yourself rewarded with a terrific viewing experience.
The plot itself is described as ""resovoir geeks"" which is accurate.  It borrows nothing from Resovoir Dogs, however, but the premise of being a heist movie.  Though to call this a heist movie in the traditional sense, would be silly.  Our characters here have no idea how to pull a REAL crime, instead robbing a bookstore and even running practice jobs on one characters parents home.
Ultimately this movie is about friendship and cameraderie, and all of the strange ways we try to fit in.  Definitely worth seeing.",1066348800,,1035,4.748603351955308
13299,4,0767821408,"""Bottle Rocket"" lacks the focus and maturity of Wes Anderson's two later films, ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", but it is nonetheless a satisfying and often very funny film. Based on a short film that director/co-writer Anderson made in 1994, ""Bottle Rocket"" tells the story of three 20-somethings who aspire to be thieves.
The comparison to ""Reservoir Dogs"" that appears on the cover is without basis, in my opinion. There is little grit or darkness to Wes's film. There's next-to-nothing in the way of violence or true obscenity (the things that often turn me off to Tarantino's films). It's colorful and bouncy, which is a good way to describe Dignan, the offbeat character played by co-writer Owen Wilson. It's the finest comedy work I've seen from Owen.
It's also (along with ""Tenenbaums"") the best performance I've seen from his brother Luke, who plays the protagonist Anthony. Luke's performance is subdued and also, very funny. The brothers have great chemistry together, and are able to make each other's performance more entertaining.
Robert Musgrave rounds out the trio and gives a delightfully quirky performance as the awkward one who endures constant abuse from his brother. He cements his place in the group simply because he is the one who has the car. James Caan and Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana also deliver energy and comedy in their supporting roles.
""Bottle Rocket"" is a wise film, and it makes a nice companion to the two aforementioned Wes Anderson films that everyone has seen. It is wise, fast-moving and extremely funny, although certainly not to everyone's tastes.
The DVD from Columbia/TriStar is completely featureless (not even a trailer), but it displays the film's colorful palette with a crispness and fidelity that is most satisfying.",1062547200,,1781,5.144827586206897
13300,4,0767821408,"""Bottle Rocket"" is the first film written by Luke Wilson and directed by Wes Anderson, the duo that would later go on to create both ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".  Despite the fact that this is the first film that these two worked on together, ""Bottle Rocket"" is every bit as good as the more recognized and well known follow-ups.  This film marks the introduction of a very unique and original brand of humor, a type of humor that can possibly be mistaken for drama if the viewer isn't paying close enough attention.  This is not in your face comedy, but rather a subtle, quirky sense of humor delivered in a deadpan style that in its own way is extremely rewarding and enjoyable.
The film itself features great direction, music and acting. In particular, Luke Wilson's portrayal of Dignan ranks among some of the most complex comedic performances I have ever seen.  As for the rest of the cast, the performances are funny, heartfelt, and sincere.  This combination of emotion adds a realistic dimension to ""Bottle Rocket"".  This is a funny film, and comical things continually happen to the characters, but it is humor that seems to exist somewhere in the real world.  ""Bottle Rocket"" does not focus soley on comedy, but incorporates aspects of everyday life into its story.  Wheareas most comedies must go over the top to provide laughs, in essence creating cartoonish characters that could never really exist, ""Bottle Rocket"" proves that real life can be just as funny.",1060646400,,1482,4.853174603174603

I think I appreciate it for what it attempts to do as much as what it accomplishes.  I love the fact that Bottle Rocket is, at heart, a love story - the love between two friends and the love between a man and a woman.

13334,3,0767821408,"The film gets 3.5 stars, the DVD 2. (Hey Wes, no commentary? You knew we'd be scrambling for Bottle Rocket once Rusmore was released...)
This film is like a Wes Anderson dress rehersal. It has the same off-beat characterization, unique camera work, and moments of hilarity. But it's clearly Anderson's vision in the incubation stage--the film left me wanting, like watching a short that was unnaturally stretched to feature length.
Owen Wilson plays Digan wonderfully, the man just not smart enough to become a master criminal. In fact, his entire view of the world is so contrived once senses that he was inspired to a life of crime by watching an A&E special. His sidekicks are equally clueless, but lack Dignan's near-insane commitment to a life of crime.
The narrative however is weakned by the love story, however charming and sweet. Luke Wilson's character--somewhat indecisive and melancholy to begin with--suddenly comes across like your typical schnook from a John Hughes movie.
The strength of the movie lies in the Big Caper and all the planning (and botches) that precede it. James Caan was brilliant as the local boss and would-be kingpin, who tries to give the boys from Plano a little taste of reality.
It reminds me a lot of another very funny, young Texan road flick: Fandango. But unlike this Kevin Costner predecessor, Bottle Rocket tends to wander, and lacks a lot of genuine emotion. Overall, it's a respectable debut film and is interesting to see the earlier fruits of Wes Andersons's creativity. As far as 1990s indie films go, you could do much worse...

James Caan plays big-time crime boss, Mr. Henry, who Dignan is desperately trying to impress in hopes that he too might become a big time player.  From a mall bookstore to Hinkley Cold Storage, the story weaves the characters in and out of silly, yet believable adventures that makes the movie ""a DELIGHT"" to watch!!

Like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, their follow-up films, Bottle Rocket is a wonderful mix of deranged humour and quiet sadness.  The drama always stops just short of heartbreaking, and the comedy just short of slapstick, leaving us only with a bunch of characters we care about, and their crazy, messed up lives.
Bottle Rocket is not flawless.  I'm not sure why not, just as I'm not entirely sure why its so close to flawless.  But it has a wonderful screenplay, full of such lines as ""Bob's gone, he stole his car!"" or, in response to one characters depression that his eight year old sister thinks he's a failure, ""She thinks your a failure?  What she ever do with her life that was so great?""  The romance between main character Anthony and the Paraguayan housekeeper Inez is touching, as is the sometimes uncomfortable friendship between Anthony and the bonkers-in-a-sad-kind-of-way Dignan.  Scenes stay in your memory, like Anthony and Bob watching the retreating Dignan through a fence, or Dignan handing a sparkler to Inez.  The cast is great, from Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson (Owen is always an obvious standout, Luke is the type who you appreciate more with each film you see him in) to Robert Musgrave as the hangdog Bob and Lumi Cavazos as Inez.

To my surprise it wasn't.  I loved the characters and the way it was put together, it definitely had its own style.  The characters are what makes this movie so great.  Luke Wilson gives a great performance as Anthony the main character.  Owen Wilson gives an equally great performance as Dignan, Anthony's best friend.  It was easy to identify with the characters in the movie, it was like watching people you grew up with.  The circumstances in the movie were unusual, but it doesn't really matter.  The movie is not really about what they are doing, it's about their relationship with each other and how each they deal with what's happening.  There is also a lot of humor in the movie, which adds to the character's personalities.  The humor really makes the characters and there situation seem real.  It's hard to explain this movie to anyone, because it really defies categorization.  I would definitely recommend this movie, especially those with an offbeat sense of humor.",1019952000,,1146,4.751269035532995
13364,4,0767821408,"With BOTTLE ROCKET the Wilson Bros. and Wes Anderson launched their impressive careers. And no wonder, for this film is a delight to watch. It's completely devoid of the cynicism, brutal violence, and pop-culture-ridden cliches of mid '90s filmdom. I completely fell in love with Owen Wilson's acting, his comic delivery and utterly sincere reading of Dignan, was like nothing I'd ever seen. Of course Anderson & Wilson's script, though nowhere near as astute as RUSHMORE or THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, is the real charmer here. They are the Dynamic Duo of scriptwriting today, it's too bad Oscar didn't notice that this year. I look forward to their future collaborations and solo projects.",1019001600,2,685,5.125
13365,5,0767821408,"If someone were to ask me why I enjoyed this movie so much, I wouldn't know what to say. I know certain parts of it that I like (just about every part), but all in all I can't figure out what it is about BOTTLE ROCKET that gets me. But I guess that just makes the two people who wrote it (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson) geniuses.
BOTTLE ROCKET involves three guys that want to rob places. But is that what it is really about? I still can't figure it out. I might need to watch it again and again until I find some kind of theme; but then again, I don't really care (the movie is that good).
In the beginning, Dignan (Owen Wilson) and his friend Anthony (Luke Wilson) are two guys that are about to go rob stores or banks or I don't know what. I'm not going to tell you the entire sequence of events, but I am going to tell you that the characters have so much depth, the dialogue is so well-written, and each scene is so good that this movie should be praised by everyone.
But BOTTLE ROCKET isn't praised by everyone. Most people probably haven't even heard of it. Why? No idea, but it doesn't really matter. If you haven't seen this movie, for the love of God, go see it. You will especially enjoy watching Owen Wilson's character every time he's on the screen. Thank you Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. Brilliant. Pure Genius.",1018742400,,1325,4.241106719367589
13376,4,0767821408,"BOTTLE ROCKET is an exceptionally fresh and thoroughly fun movie. I found myself smiling throughout, and not even sure why. I can't even say what kind of movie it is. For BOTTLE ROCKET defies any attempt at classification, any assault on its originality and creativity by placing it neatly in a box. It is neither a comedy nor a drama; not a love story nor a crime flick. It blends all of these genres--along with a pinch of classic Americana--into a very unique, delightful movie. Yet it is also a deliciously messy enigma: a loosely strung-together melange of brillance and childishness, high and pop art, profundity and absurdity. By the film's conclusion, I knew I had seen something special, a truly inspired and deeply personal work.
BOTTLE ROCKET's power lies in its characters. They are so quirky, so unique, that they seem unmistakably real, and therefore patently likeable. They are simple people who lead quietly extraordinary and beautiful lives, people who believe in following one's dreams, chasing after true love, being individuals--and all with childlike wonder, innocence, and joie de vivre. In short, they are people of unique and genuine character. They also happen to be hysterically funny. BOTTLE ROCKET, while I would not categorically call it a comedy, is easily one of the funniest movies of the nineties. The brothers Owen and Luke Wilson give laudable (although not flawless) performances as the two principals, and they are supported admirably by some great character actors.
BOTTLE ROCKET is also a beatiful picture. The photograhpy is excellent--stylish in an understated way--and this adds an element of class to an already quality piece. Almost every shot would make an excellent photograph, full of rich and subtle detail, and interesting interplay of colors, textures, and distances. BOTTLE ROCKET does not have lavish sets, nor does it take place in exotic locales. Anderson instead transforms what would otherwise be lacklustre settings like rural Texas and a cheap motel into places of almost otherworldly beauty. The lighting has a lot to do with this effect, giving the movie a very clean, bright feel--think of a J.Crew ad, only set in the rural Midwest instead of a Cape Cod beach house. The movie gives the warm, uplifting feeling of a young, free, and beautiful America, a feeling one gets at certain times reading Kerouac. The music is superb to boot, as in all Anderson's flicks, and greatly enhances the visual experience.
Yet BOTTLE ROCKET falls short in its bid for perfection. For one thing, the love story, while sometimes touching, is very artifical and abstract. At times I really wanted Inez and Anthony to get together, but I couldn't help but feel manipulated by the forced nature of their love. Anthony instantly falls in love with the motel housekeeper, who doesn't speak a word of English because she's from Paraguay. The love-at-first-sight gimmick only works when the characters develop a fulfilling emotional bond over time, but this doesn't happen in BOTTLE ROCKET. Also, I think Anderson indulges in the 1960's motif a bit much. From the music to the sets to the hairstyles, everything reeks of the sixties--hell, even all the cars are vintage. There are points in the film where one could easily forget it was made in '96. The ending even reminded me of COOL HAND LUKE. But BOTTLE ROCKET, I've learned, is a very subjective experience and therein lies its genius, at least in part. If you have a well-developed eye, you'll probably like this film, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The movie's much like a bottle rocket, in fact: it can spark, sizzle, and delight, but in the end, you're not sure whether it could have had more substance. Final note: the DVD is bare-bones. Can't we get at least a commentary, people?",1018483200,,3783,4.996830427892235
13377,4,0767821408,"As its title indicates, 'Bottle Rocket' is a desperately sad comedy about confinement and the reach for liberation.  Framed by men incarcerated in institutions accompanied by friends, the film switches expertly between perspectives and patterns - from wide country spaces to cramped interiors whose very shapes seem to offer yet another wall to kick against; from hope-fuelled plans to inept executions; from the need to settle down to the desire to escape; from children to adults, friends to lovers, play to work; from comedy to tragedy, the ideal to real, fireworks to damp squibs, trust to lies, innocence to experience.  And, for genius director Wes Anderson, from the limitations of genre, to the messy, vibrant open-endedness of emotional experience.
If the characters in 'Bottle Rocket' were children, the whole thing would seem a lark.  A young man, Anthony, is released from a mental hospital, where he was rocovering from 'exhaustion'; he is met by his high-wired friend Dignan, who bombards him with blueprints for the next 50 years of their lives.  They plan a heist on a book store, bringing in a rich friend, car-owning Bob, frequent victim of his beefy older brother's bullying.  This is intended to impress the Kafkaesque figure of Mr. Henry, a landscape-gardener-...-ganglord.  They cross states 'on the lam' for a while, where Anthony falls in love with Inez, a cleaner from Paraguay with little English.  Bob, his brother arrested for drug-dealing, goes back with the car.  Frustrated by failed love and broken dreams, Anthony and Dignan have a fight, Anthony returning home to relative normality.  Then Dignan turns up in a yellow boiler-suit, with the big plan that's going to turn their lives...
The film is full of play, silliness, mucking about, kids pretending they're big men, their failures eliciting laughter and sympathy.  Anderson's fluid but fidgety style, true to the needs of his story, but employing all manner of stylistic variations, approximates his young heroes' vitality, imagination and restlessness, while the family intimacy of cast and crew spills into the performances.  Because these aren't kids, though, because their lives are slipping away, because their dreams far outstrip their means, the larks stop being funny.  The true hero of the film is not the compromising Anthony, through whose developing eyes we watch it (the nocturnal, neon-pool love scene at the motel is a hymn to quiet rapture, quickly intruded on by his friend), but Dignan, a man out of time (and, let's be honest, mind), a man with ambition, big ideas in a little land, a straw target easily unstuffed by burly policemen; a man who needs space, confined.
Although it wasn't especially noticed at the time, 'Bottle Rocket' now looks set to join 'Citzen Kane', 'They Live By Night' and 'Badlands' as one of the great American debuts.  It has the spaciousness, generosity, inbuilt mystery, feel for America and stylistic depth that could see it grow.",1016582400,2,2967,5.130705394190872
13378,5,0767821408,"Early on in ""Bottle Rocket"", there's an exchange that crystallizes, for me, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's filmmaking ethos.  The scene is set at night.  Three men are sitting in their car outside a bookstore, pre-robbery.  Dignan (Owen) and Anthony (Luke Wilson) put white tape across the bridges of their noses.  Bob (Robert Musgrave), the get-away driver, innocently asks, ""Why is there tape on your nose?""  Dignan, with a devilish grin stretching from ear to ear, excitedly replies, ""Exactly!""  It's typical for Anderson/Wilson characters to not fully understand the reason for their actions (or if they do, never tell the audience), while knowing that, like sharks, if they stop moving they will die.
""Bottle Rocket"" grew out of a notion that Anderson and Wilson had that their generation, so long believed to be idle and apathetic, could accomplish great things if they channeled their boundless energy.  The problem being, what did they want to accomplish?  This is no better exemplified than with Dignan.  He is a wonderful creation: a case of arrested development whose actions are completely unexpected.  Sure, you know he's going to screw up somehow, but will it be through his over-extended bravado, or just his general incompetence?  And try as you might, you just can't get a complete read on his personality.  He shows not a whit of self-awareness until the film's final scene, a genuinely surprising moment where he has enough self-awareness for ten men.
It is Dignan who acts as the impetus for what is going to go down: a youthful crime operation is to be formed, with the sole intent of proving to the local crime boss (James Caan, in a role that's probably too small; still, Caan, in his brief scenes, shines) that they are ready to jump to the big leagues.  Only they aren't.  And probably never will be.  This is where most of the film's broad comedy comes from: watching Dignan and his boys try their best, and constantly fail through misguided attempts, to become real thieves (at one point they rob Anthony's house, just for practice).
While Dignan is the showier role, Anthony is the crux of the movie; it is told through his eyes.  Luke Wilson, an actor of low-key charm who gets more appealing the more I watch him, plays the yin to his brother Owen's yang.  Anthony is Dignan's more adult alter ego.  Or, more accurately, he's Dignan's Big Brother figure: full of support and amusement for Dignan's harebrained schemes, always willing to lend a hand, and, if needed, a sane word.  An odd role for a man just released from a mental hospital.  And Wilson, in his first film role, even gets to play a very touching and tender romance with Inez (Lumi Cavazos), a Spanish-only speaking maid at a motel.  It's this section, which takes up most of the film's middle third, which defines Anthony's character most.
It is the one scene in the mental hospital that, in a few scant moments, defines Anthony and Dignan's relationship.  Anthony is ready to check out, voluntarily, but a confused Dignan wants to help him break out.  Always the good sport, Anthony ties several bed sheets together, explains politely to his doctor what he's doing, and casually rappels down the wall, while his friend, hiding in the bushes, couldn't be more excited that his plan was a success.  Dignan, the adventurous man-child with big ideas and loads of initiative, and Anthony, the ever-loyal friend who always wants to do his buddy right, compliment each other so well in this scene, as they do throughout the movie.  It is a fascinating and complex, but very dear, relationship.
Anderson's filmmaking style, so effervescent in his next two films (""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums""), still shines through here, although it is hampered by two things.  First, he has a stingier budget to work with (at one point we see inmates wearing jumpsuits emblazoned with the words ""WASCO STATE PENITENTIARY""; the same suit, if seen in ""Tenenbaums"" would be professionally made and ornate, while here it appears to be a painter's overalls written on with magic marker).  Second, whereas ""Rushmore"" and ""Tenenbaums"" were basically confined to one setting (a prep school and a Manhattan townhouse respectively), ""Bottle Rocket"" is a road movie.  Anderson can't plan elaborate tableaus, filled with precious details, when the location may change from scene to scene.  These aren't harsh criticisms, mind you.  But I did feel like Anderson wasn't able to fully play to his strengths here, as he got a chance to later.
That's not to say he doesn't still indulge in his passion for vibrant details.  One fine example is Dignan's notebook, outlining his 75-year (!) plan for success.  It goes by quickly, so you'll have to pause if you want to read each page as it flips by.  I recommend you do.  It's a marvel of low-key ambition and wrong-headed planning.  And Anderson's passion for music, a character unto itself in his later films, is more subdued, but no less effective, here.  Mark Mothersbaugh, a frequent collaborator with Anderson, again provides the score and again does a flawless, eccentric job.
""Bottle Rocket"" is a modest masterpiece.  Anderson and Wilson's script, with its Altmanesque scenes of overlapping dialogue, its obsession with the incidentals of the character's lives, and its knack for peculiar dialogue (Dignan, in an atypical moment of self-doubt, says, ""He's out. And you're out, too. And I don't think I'm in, either. No gang!""), is just plain wonderful.  Anderson's direction shows the promise he would later fulfill.  And the acting, mainly by the Wilson brothers, but also by Musgrave, Cavazos, and Caan, is not as amateurish as I would have expected.  A fine, funny, friendly film, that shoots for the moon, but doesn't flare out quickly like the fireworks for which it is named.",1013817600,4,5798,4.943240454076367
13379,5,0767821408,"Wes Anderson is now my favorite writer/director.  Rushmore was my intro to him and Owen Wilson.  After I saw, and loved, The Royal Tennenbaums I learned of Bottle Rocket - and was not disappointed!
This movie is superbly written with all of the classic Anderson/Wilson subtleties you will come to expect.  That's the beauty of this duo.  The films have everything to do with nuance and small detail that, after repeated viewings, you can't help but laugh out loud.

13380,5,0767821408,"Whenever I watch a movie, good or bad, I ask myself what is serving what in the movie.  For example, in a lot of contemporary big-budget films, plot, script, and character all serve to support the special effects.  Oftentimes everything seems to be serving the lead actor.  In adult films, everything serves the orgasm.  Generally there is one thing that is the point of the film, and everything else exists as placeholders.  I think for Bottle Rocket, the master is character, and the plot really serves to motivate character development.  For whatever reason, and for whatever its worth, this seems like a much more valid point than, say, explosions or Kevin Costner's classic good looks.
Still, to make a movie work, you've got to have more than good characters.  And in Bottle Rocket, every factor holds its own.  The film is wonderful to watch on a visual level, with vibrant colors and placeless locations.  The acting is eccentric and genuine, with the subtle and sweet Luke Wilson, and the endearingly pathetic Dignon.  The writing is spot-on, with indrecibly funny one-liners and dry wit spewing out so regularly that you'll need to watch it at least twice to digest all the humor.
Most importantly is that at the end of the movie, you will love these charcters, and want to watch the movie again to keep them alive.",1010793600,7,1325,4.797356828193832

I enjoyed it even more the 2nd time i watched it with ""closed captioning"" on, so that i didn't miss any of the words or humor.  also, the 2nd time, i noticed things i didn't catch the 1st time, such as who was in a fight in a bar in the background, and what he said to call for help, etc.  the romantic scenes were some of the best ever.  all in all, a very entertaining movie for both males and females.",1009584000,,701,4.155555555555556
13382,1,0767821408,"With mostly positive reviews you would assume that Bottle Rocket was an absolute winner. Yet I can't help but agree with one review which I have seen here which rates it at only a single star and that everything else here is either misguided or overly-generous.
I came to this film via Rushmore which was a sublime and enjoyable film. Unfortunately Bottle Rocket is nothing more than a rehearsal for Rushmore where Anderson got hold of a decent story and some wonderful actors (it's telling that the much of the incidental music in Rushmore is lifted from this film).
Here the story is stilted, the dialogue lacks any of the zip needed for a comedy, while the acting is unremarkable at best and cringe worthy at worst. I spent a long time trying to nail down what this film is about but I suspect it is really about nothing, and that it was simply an exercise in getting a movie made that would help secure the necessary funding for Rushmore. If it did that, then at least it deserves the single star.
If Bottle Rocket had stayed as a short film I would have had no qualms with it but it really has no legs as a feature-length film. Sadly this is the only movie I have ever bought that I actually threw out - and it cost me a fair bit to order it from the States! Bought as a present for my Rushmore-loving sister she was bemused at first and then immensely disappointed.
I think the mundane but true fact is that almost every film-maker with a few movies under their belt will direct a stinker - this has got to be Anderson's - but he's already proved that he can make a quirky film that is engaging and entertaining. This isn't it.",1006646400,14,1633,4.357377049180328
13383,4,0767821408,"Bottle Rocket is a film by Wes Anderson, who, along with actor Owen Wilson wrote this fantastic film full of smart humor and unique directing.  Everything done in the film is intentional, such as the outfits worn and the colors used in the background.  Anderson's unique visual style along with Owen Wilson's hysterical comedic delivery make this film an absolute keeper.  It stars 3 would be criminals who hold up a bookstore and then run off and hide in an unknown remote hotel.  The trio leaves at a burst of catastrophe which involves one of the characters brother who has trouble with the law.  The end result is a final commission from a big wig thief (James Caan) whom Owen Wilson's character idolizes to rob an old factory.  The story drags a bit at the hotel sequence, but the hysterical finale makes it all worthwhile.  I must mention as well that the characters are great and very unique in that each of their personalities has something massively easy to remember.
  The dvd has no extras, and seeing as the film is spawned off of a 30 minute short of the same name, it would have been great to see some extras treatment.  Comparitively, the commentary track and extras that were piled onto the Criterion Collections ""Rushmore"" dvd make you wish even more that ""Bottle Rocket"" could have gotten at least something(Anderson and Wilson's commentary in ""Rushmore"" open the eyes of the viewer to so many great things that most likely would have gone unnoticed..how much more for this one!).  Yet as it stands, I think we are lucky this film is on dvd at all.
  The music is wonderful, completely unique, and adds to every scene.  The humor in the movie is comparable to Anderson's other film ""Rushmore"" as well as the hidden gem ""Safe Men"" in that it is very dialogue driven.  Fans of ""Tommy Boy"" or ""Ace Ventura"" may not enjoy the humor quite as much.  It is like ""Waiting for Guffman"" in that the first time you see it you may laugh out loud a bit, but you will quote the movie for weeks after.  The second viewing is always the best, and each time after I have noticed different expressions from the characters and laughed in many different places.  So give it a try and check out something new.  This is Owen Wilsons first movie, Wes Anderson's first feature film, and it is the first of (hopefully) many collaborative efforts to come.  Also check out ""Rushmore"" and the soon to be born ""Royal Tenenbaums"".
I gave the dvd 4/5 stars due to the lack of the extras, but the print is clean, it can be viewed in either wide or full screen, and the movie-though not flawless-is one of a kind.",1006646400,11,2598,4.546236559139785

It was boring, and most of the time it didn't seem to be going anywhere. I expected to laugh alot after reading most of the reviews here. Now, I know a good comedy when I see one, and honestly I don't think I laughed at all. When a comedy runs pretty much only on dialouge I understand it can be hard to keep people interested. With all the horrible comedys out there, there really isn't many to enjoy. Look at the Big Lebowski, the funniest movie ever made, in my opinion. I am looking foward to seeing The Royal Tennanbaums this winter, and hopefully Wes Anderson keeps getting better.

Amongst the many brilliant one-liners and silly cite gags (there are lots!) is a truly profound story of friendship, sacrifice and the importance of following your dreams.  Disillusioned with the vanity and idleness of ""laying out by the boat house"" with sorority girls, Anthony Adams (Luke Wilson) ""goes nuts"" but is able to resurrect himself by helping his bumbling friend Dignan live out his oddball dreams.  In the end Anthony and Dignan are exactly where they dreamed they'd be even though one's in jail and the other dating a housekeeper who can't speak English.
If nothing else, this movie is worth watching only to see Owen Wilson play Dignan, who is easily one of the best comedic characters of the last decade.  Wilson plays the character as well as anyone could, which is no surprise since he also co-wrote the film with Wes Anderson, who is himself one of the hottest young director's in Hollywood.

For instance the gang is persuded on foot by police officers shouting ""stop!"". Dignan shouts back ""Go!"" after every ""stop!"" shouted by the police.

The movie is basically this:  that there are two friends, Anthony and Dignan.  Dignan's major goal is to start a ""crew,"" to live the life of a crime boss.  So they go out on a mission, robbing a store, and it's hilarious to see them working together, bumbling, their dumb ideas, etc.  Then, after the robbery, they go on the lamb, which ain't no trip to Cleveland.  The movie slows down here, but what do you expect?  This movie was created from a short film, done so independently.  And the ending, with James Caan, is priceless.  The DVD does not have a lot of extra features, just the menus, etc.  Hopefully they will re-release this film with more features, since this was released before The Matrix came out on DVD and special features became a staple.

13414,5,0767821408,"I think that's the line. I've seen this film so many times I can't count. And, no, I can't spurt out great lines. I've never been good at that.
So I'll just say that this is one of the top movies of the 90's, and one of the funniest movies ever. I could keep going with hyperboles, but they're meaningless.
What makes this film, as one reviewer said, is the humanity. We actually love these guys. Dignan is obtuse, potentially dangerous (mainly to himself), and an adorable little kid. The three of them fight like 12 year olds. I love it when Dignan feels hurt, then mumbles, ""You know my mom and Greg (?) aren't speaking to me"" (or something like that).
The love between Anthony and Inez is sexual and innocent. Surprise. There's no nudity. There's a ""come on, let's run away"" spirit in Anthony. Inez is more practical. First she has to learn English, since there's no chance Anthony will learn Spanish. Something has to be done. After all, Rocky certainly isn't the best interpreter, and Dignan doesn't give the best messages!
The reason I mention Grace is because that little 8(?) year old is the grownup in this film. Dignan even feels threatened by her (I won't give away his defensive retorts). I'm sure this is a major theme in Wes Anderson's films. He is fascinated by adults who haven't grown up (Bill Murray in Rushmore), and kids that are wise beyond their years (Grace, Jason Schwartzman's character and his little friend).

13419,4,0767821408,"I first saw ""Bottle Rocket"" on the independant film channel while in New York. It was about three o'clock in the morning and I couldn't sleep. I flipped on the telly and looked for the closest thing to interesting on. It just so happened that ""Bottle Rocket"" was the first thing to catch my eye, so ""Bottle Rocket"" it was. Once back home, I couldn't stop telling everyone about this charming little flick I had seen. After I had begun to annoy myself with telling the plot over and over again, I decided that it was probably smart to buy the thing and get it over with. It was a choice well made.
""Bottle Rocket"" is one of those movies that can take place anywhere, any time and with any slew of characters. It's simple. I guess that's why I like it. The appealingness of it all isn't really the fact that it was psycologically stimulating but that you can relate to each and every one of the characters. Beyond the mental instabilaty of Dignan or the obsessiveness of Anthony you begin to see three friends, each with many flaws, trying to make it in the harsh real world. I suppose that's the only way to describe ""Bottle Rocket""...Real.
I found the lack of special effects and expensive stuff made the movie better. You focused more on the lines and the plot, rather than the great car and two billion dollar explosion that just errupted. Think of it as cinimatic cleansing.
It's a great story about getting out there and getting dirty. Doing what humans do best....living life.

It didn't seem as funny or as quirky to me as many of the other reviewers seemed to think (yes, I do watch non-mainstream movies and think I got the jokes/lines in this one).  I thought Rushmore was a better movie in the line of dark, quirky movies (though still not 5 stars either).
That being said, there *were* some funny lines in the movie, an interesting house, and of course Lumi Cavazos can do no wrong (as the motel housekeeper -- she also played Tita in Like Water for Chocolate).

13437,5,0767821408,"BOTTLE ROCKET, directed by Wes Anderson, rewards intelligence.  Is that elitist?  Maybe.  But in a world of candy-coated  feed-it-to-me-in-the-simplest-of-ways movies, BOTTLE ROCKET is a gem which  you have to examine every facet.  And Owen Wilson's Dignan is a comic  masterpiece.  I would love to see another Dignan movie.
What's the plot?  Basically, it's about three friends who decide to be bank robbers.  Anthony  (Luke Wilson), who has just checked himself out of a mental institution, is  friends with Dignan, a man-child who dreams of being a bigtime thief.  Bob  is their other friend, the getaway driver, mostly given that position  because he's the only person they know with a car.  Together the three live  a life of crime, basically because there doesn't seem to be all that much  else to do.
What sets this movie apart from other crime films is the warm  center at its heart.  The film cares about Dignan, Anthony, and Bob.  And  it goes out of its way to say that being a dreamer is not only okay in this  world, it's a preferred way of life.
This film was written by Wes  Anderson and Owen Wilson, who also co-wrote the brilliant RUSHMORE and next  year's THE ROYAL TANENBAUMS.  In my opinion, they are the best writers in  Hollywood today.  Some of the lines of dialogue should all be on a T-Shirt  somewhere.  ""On the run from Johnny Law...ain't no trip to  Cleveland!""  ""They'll never catch me, man, because I'm  &%*#&%# innocent!""

Another is just  trying to impress his jerk brother and the third just wants to be a good  friend and find a chick to love.
The result is a hilarious series of  poorly executed robberies, mostly robbing people they know.  The last  robbery is so over planned and yet completely miscalculated it becomes an  absolute mess.  I laughed so hard and for so long at the last robbery I  almost passed out from a lack of oxygen.  This is a fun film with two  endearing lead characters.
The only criticism I have is the time spent  on the love interest.  It seemed contrived and added as filler.  I suspect  the short version is better because it probably severly underplayed or  didn't include the love interest at all.  But that is really a minor flaw.

Bottle Rocket is cleverly written by Wes Anderson and Owen  Wilson, and even more ingeniously ad-libbed by Owen Wilson and his brother  Luke.  Family chemistry can be a great thing, and in Bottle Rocket, it's  spectacular.  If Owen Wilson one of the best comic performances of the  '90s, it's partially due to the fact that Luke Wilson gives a wonderful  straight-man performance.

Written by an excellent duo, Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson, and directed by Anderson,  this film is a witty, comic gem! A film about three suburban friends who  aspire to become big time thieves, this is a true human adventure in so  many ways! The Wilson brothers are so much fun to watch, and Anderson's  direction is true to life. This film is hilarious and gets even better upon  multiple viewings. Highly recommended!",948844800,3,543,4.858695652173913
13476,5,0767821408,"Bottle Rocket is the Cat's Pajamas. I smile everytime I think about it. As many have pointed out, this film must be seen multiple times to really enjoy it. This is absolutely true. It took me two viewings to truly  appreciate its brilliance.
The DVD features are limited, but its nice to  have it on Widescreen. Maybe Criterion will give this the wonderful  treatment they gave to Rushmore. This would be the perfect chance for us  fans to finally see the 13-minute short film version the boys initially  took to Sundance. (I know, I'm a dreamer, but it could happen.)
I feel I  must encourage everyone to buy this DVD because, sadly, this film didn't  even make back its budget in its theatrical run.",948412800,,701,4.604838709677419

13478,5,0767821408,"I love this movie for many of the same reasons that other reviews here have listed...Dignan, the asburdity of his plans, how human and real everyone acts, etc. But another wonderful quality is the beautiful romance  between Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Inez (Lumi Cavazos). It's a sweet, and  again, REAL portrayal of a breathless yet awkward affair between an Anglo  suburban guy who can't speak Spanish and a Paraguayan motel cleaner who  can't really speak English. Still, they both have in common a feeling of  drift and aimlessness (why else would Anthony allow Dignan to involve him  in Dignan's ridiculous schmes?)that allows them to form a wordless bond.  This is the kind of character portrayal at which the Wilson-Anderson films  excel. I must say, though, that I prefer ""Bottle Rocket"" over  ""Rushmore"". Maybe it's just sentimental because I saw  ""Bottle Rocket"" first--they're both wonderful films.",947808000,2,907,5.1931034482758625
13479,5,0767821408,"""Rushmore"" and ""Bottle Rocket"" the two most sincere movies of the 90's I believe. They are so true to life and have so many good actors in it. I'll start with ""Bottle Rocket."" As I was  watching this my father said, ""This is horrible acting."" The  later he said,""Wait...they aren't acting. They're being human.""  And that's what it is with both of these movies. Being human...showing life  for what it is and not what you see in the movies and on TV. Life isn't  perfect...but it sure as hell can be funny. Wes Anderson is brilliant. In  Bottle Rocket Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are great. One of my favorite  movies of all times. Then there's ""Rushmore""...it is my favorite  movie of all times. It's so sincere and real, and touching and funny and  it's a blethera of emotions. I felt sorry for the characters, I laughed at  them, and I felt their pain. Love stinks. Jason Shwartzman is great as Max  Fischer, and Mason Gamble is great as his little fried...I see he's moving  on to good roles from ""Dennis the Menace."" Bill Murray shows his  true acting talents for once. I mean, Bill Murray was hilarious  before...but now he's respectable. Olivia Williams is pleasant as the  teacher both of them are ga-ga over, but she doesn't really have that much  to do with her role. The whole movie leaves me with a smirk on my face.  Life can be funny is what both of these movies teach us. It can be really  funny. Bad things happen so later in life we can make jokes about it. And  that's what these movies show I think. They are real as you'll ever get, no  Hollywood BANG! This is life people, and you will crack up at it. Just see  these two movies. They will make you actual use your brain when you are  watching a comedy.",941846400,15,1724,4.389240506329114
13480,5,0767821408,"If this film were released just a few years later, I think it would've been a huge indie hit.  The Wilson brothers are both so talented and funny  (not to mention hotties) and they play these characters so well.  The  writing is witty and sharp, the filming is right-on... even the music is  perfect.  One of my all-time favorites, and worth owning for keeps.",941155200,,359,4.53125
13481,5,0767821408,"This is one of the more unique comedies you will ever see.  I've probably seen it about 10 times and still laugh hard all the way thru: dignan is dressed up in a yellow jump-suit on a mini bike -> futureman: ""He  looks like a little banana""...

13484,3,0767821408,"Luke Wilson (Home Fries) stars in this wacky tale of 3 idiot would-be theives. It's like dumb and dumber turn to crime. Some of the jokes are funny, like when they are at a motel and yelling back and forth from the  balcony to the pool about how they need to hide their identity. An  interesting turn comes when hiding out at that same motel, Luke's character  discovers a beautiful maid from Paraguay. He falls instantly in love with  her even though they don't speak the same language. I would have liked this  story to progress further, but instead the trio leave to go on to further  theivery. The DVD itself is barren. No trailer, no featurette, no  commentary, not even cast bios. It was something to watch anyway, and these  eccentric characters are amusing.",933292800,,765,4.614814814814815

He's the funniest character because he takes himself soooo seriously. I've  never laughed at a movie as much as I did with this gem. Maybe, it's  because I relate to the characters so much.",923961600,,336,4.234375

I love this  movie so much all I can say is I was counting the days until it came out on  video when it disappeared from theatres so quickly.

Anthony (Luke Wilson) has a rather flat affect, while his friend Dignan (Owen Wilson), the visionary  of the pair, tends toward the manic. Thefilm consists of many small character moments as Dignan tries to actualize his 75-year plan for success and Anthony tries to connect with another human being, including a sweet romance with a hotel housekeeper who doesnt speak English (Lumi Cavazos).  Low-key but entertaining. The culminating heist is a highlight.",1511395200,,559,5.258426966292135
