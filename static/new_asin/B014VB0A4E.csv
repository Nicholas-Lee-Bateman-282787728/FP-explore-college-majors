8731905,5,B014VB0A4E,"- Synopsis: A group of unique students decide to make a club to prevent them from being forever alone. Since the club lacks substance, the social interactions between the club members is silly and random. However, this becomes a reminder that life doesn't follow scripts. As such, each day is always a different one as these students use their club activities to essentially bond with each other. Some, less friendly than others. As they spend more time with each other, they start slowly developing in ways that might actually describe them as being friends.

- Comments: The fan-service is great too. Uncensored goodness just like how we were born! All hail 2D waifus! This is a silly anime with nothing in-depth. Just a whacky club with interestingly diverse club members hanging out and socializing so they won't be forever alone. They do however, start to eventually bond, rather than just club members with a mutual interest.

Aside from that, it's a simple anime to enjoy and turn off your brain to. An interesting collection of unique characters that will constantly keep this anime from having a dry moment. Not to mention, that there's heavy amounts of fan-service to help generate some stimulation when dialogues between the characters become stale.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for sexual content. There's some nudity.
