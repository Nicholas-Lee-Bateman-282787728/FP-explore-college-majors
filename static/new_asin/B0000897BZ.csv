7980551,4,B0000897BZ,"this is a great story as ESPN cameras follow the streetballers from city to city....I like the stories about the guys where they started and grew up playing streetball...the game in NYC was like a 'real game' - the and1 players were serious cause they knew the ball players there you couldn't do so many tricks cause they were coming at em....same with oakland's open run....

alimoe talks about being recruited by tarkanian and fresno state, headache talks about the original 5 and1 players with footage from the original video of highlights, hot sauce comes off as the crowd favorite everywhere they go...some good video of ao...as well....its a good dvd

the full entire game played in atlanta is on 2nd disc and its fun to watch the one and only skip to my lou in action...

bottom line if you're interested in seeing real ball players who love the game and play for the competition and thrill of the game - watch these guys and support and1 basketball...yeah its streetball and its not about fundamentals or team basketball but its about players who play in the playgrounds and would play even if they never made a dime doing it....for the love of the game...",1095292800,5,1164,4.668292682926829
