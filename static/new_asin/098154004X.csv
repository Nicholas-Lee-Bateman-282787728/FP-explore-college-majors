7795014,4,098154004X,"This is a distinctly Christian perspective in parenting, not suitable for non-Christians.  This is also one of the few parenting curriculum that is based on systematic bible theology, instead of using bible verses to prop up secular parenting wisdom.

The other reviewer is correct, the production value is not very high.  However, I'm sure that those who are intent on having a more biblical worldview are not viewing this to be entertained, but to be edified.

I hope Tedd Tripp invests a little more money in future productions.  It would be a shame if he wasn't able to get these truths out to a wider audience because of the low production value.",1283299200,12,651,4.776785714285714
7795015,3,098154004X,"My review is strictly on the production of this DVD and not the content.  The content is straight from the book and I refer anyone to the book for a review of the content or to someone else's review here.

The DVD contains video of Ted presenting the content of his book.  Compared to the similar DVD presenting Shepherding a Child's Heart, this presentation was done before an apparently much larger audience.  He is speaking in a large auditorium with poor acoustics.  Although the DVD has good sound quality, Ted uses a louder speaking style in which he loses his ability to communicate with more subtle inflections and cadences in his voice.  Whereas the Shepherding video presentation is in a voice as though he were in your living room at arm's length, Ted is preaching here like he's talking to you from 50 or 60 feet away and raising his voice to be heard.

The video also features a distracting array of visual ""effects.""  When the presentation switches to slides, they feature distracting animations that add nothing to the content.  A slide with text will have swirling lines, flashing reflections and sparkles decorating it.  I get the sense they did this simply because their computer program presented the option.

I haven't finished watching all the lectures, and like I wrote, I won't review the content, but I was just disappointed with the video production.  After reading and watching Shepherding, this is like watching your dad deliver a campaign speech.  It just makes me want to tune out and hope I get to hear what he has to say in a totally different context.",1268784000,14,1583,4.754578754578755
