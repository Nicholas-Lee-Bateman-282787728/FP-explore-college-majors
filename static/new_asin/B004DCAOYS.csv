8425127,4,B004DCAOYS,"A great film about a french unit , that was based based near dien bien phu, at the tragic fall, knowing they needed to get over the border and out of laos into thailand, which in itself was a feat considering the jungle terrain, and on foot to hump it out, being stalked by viet minh , and playing hit and run all the way. this chronicles this action, in detail, historicaly not many made it, read the books on this subject, it gives better perspective. a good unit!! In the book dien bien phu, it said even after 2 years or so, they were still getting coms from units in the jungle, for resupply, until they faded. history made by men with BALLS!! Its haunting...radio coms fading into the jungle.",1499731200,,698,4.33587786259542
8425128,5,B004DCAOYS,"Have seen just about every Vietnam War film produced, but none has the realism and power of this 1965 French production. Film in stark black and white in the lush Cambodia countryside it portrays the story of a platoon of French mercenaries and their Cambodian comrades fighting a running battle against Viet Minh forces in early May 1954. Coincidentally at the time of the French defeat at the battle of Dien Bien Phu. The characters are well developed and sympathetic. No supermen these. They suffer, fight, bleed and die...and find time to drink Pernod in between as well as some cheap wine. There are scenes of opium use for medicinal purposes and recreation smoking of an undisclosed substance in a bong. Yes, the bong is a Southeast Asian invention for smoking. When it rains in the film it is real, not make believe stuff. Their clothes have that half rotted, damp and clinging look that is so perfect for the climate. Almost makes the skin crawl. 1965 would be a pivital year for American forces in Vietnam(Ia Drang battles)The film has an almost documentary quality about it. Probably the best film about Vietnam no one has heard of. Simply the best. A masterpiece of the genre of war films.",1335830400,10,1200,4.746411483253588
