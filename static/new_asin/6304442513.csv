Because I didn't think that they would like it, I didn't record it.  We'll everytime they visit, they asked to watch the movie, so I ordered it.  It is a great family movie that kids and adults won't mind watching.",1221436800,4,337,4.234375

Then at the end of the movie the cat does find his family on a farm with lots and lots of other homeless cats.
